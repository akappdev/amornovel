He pulled to the side of the road frequently to let long strings of motorists pass. Just prior to crossing the California/Oregon border, he stopped at a redwood tourist trap featuring gardens, souvenirs, wood carvings, a lunch counter and restrooms. Skipping the garden tour, he bought a sandwich and drink and headed out of the monument-size trees to the open road, which very soon revealed the rocky Oregon Coast.</p><p>Cooper stopped at the first outlook over the ocean and parked. His phone showed five bars and he dialed up the Coos County Sheriff\u2019s Department. \u201cHello,\u201d he said to the receptionist. \u201cMy name is Hank Cooper and I\u2019m on my way to Thunder Point following a call from someone saying my friend, Ben Bailey, is dead. Apparently he left something for me, but that\u2019s not why I\u2019m headed your way. The message I got was that Ben was killed, but there were no details. I want to talk to the sheriff. I need some answers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold, please,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Well, that wasn\u2019t what he expected. He\u2019d figured he\u2019d leave a number and eat his lunch while he waited.</p><p>\u201cDeputy McCain,\u201d said the new voice on the line.</p><p>\u201cHank Cooper here, Deputy,\u201d he said, and in spite of himself, he straightened and squared his shoulders. He\u2019d always been resistant to authority, yet he also responded to it. \u201cI was hoping to speak with the sheriff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the deputy sheriff. The county sheriff\u2019s office is in Coquille. This is a satellite office with a few deputies assigned. Thunder Point is small\u2014there\u2019s a constable but no other local law enforcement. The constable handles small disputes, evictions, that sort of thing. The county jail is in Coquille. How can I help you, Mr. Cooper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a friend of Ben Bailey and I\u2019m on my way into town to find out what happened to him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMr. Cooper, Ben Bailey\u2019s been deceased for more than a couple of weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gather that. I just found out. Some old guy\u2014Rawley someone\u2014found a phone number and called me. He was killed, Rawley said. Dead and buried. I want to know what happened to him. He was my friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can give you the details in about ninety seconds.\u201d</p><p>But Cooper wanted to look him in the eye when he heard the tale. \u201cIf you\u2019ll give me directions, I\u2019ll come to the Sheriff\u2019s Department.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s not necessary. I can meet you at the bar,\u201d the deputy said.</p><p>\u201cWhat bar?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBen\u2019s. I guess you weren\u2019t a close friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe go back fifteen years but this is my first trip up here. We were supposed to meet with a third buddy from the Army in Virgin River for some hunting. Ben always said he had a bait shop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say he sold a lot more Wild Turkey than bait. You know where Ben\u2019s place is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly sort of,\u201d Cooper said.</p><p>\u201cTake 101 to Gibbons Road, head west. After about four miles, look for a homemade sign that says Cheap Drinks. Turn left onto Bailey Pass. It curves down the hill. You\u2019ll run right into Bailey\u2019s. When do you think you\u2019ll get there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just crossed into Oregon from California,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m pulling a fifth wheel. Couple of hours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore like three. I\u2019ll meet you there if nothing interferes. Is this your cell number?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have good reception on the coast. I\u2019ll give you a call if I\u2019m held up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Deputy...what was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMcCain. See you later, Mr. Cooper.\u201d</p><p>Cooper signed off, slipped the phone into his jacket pocket and got out of the truck. He put his lunch on the hood and leaned against the truck, looking out at the northern Pacific Ocean. He\u2019d been all over the world, but this was his first trip to the Oregon Coast. The beach was rocky and there were boulders two stories high sticking out of the water. An orange-and-white helicopter flew low over the water\u2014a Coast Guard HH-65 Dolphin, search and rescue.</p><p>For a moment he had a longing to be back in a chopper. Once he got this business about Ben straightened out, he might get to the chore of looking for a flying job. He\u2019d done a number of things air-related after the Army. The most recent was flying out of the Corpus Christi port to offshore oil rigs. But after a spill in the Gulf, he was ready for a change.</p><p>His head turned as he followed the Coast Guard chopper across the water. He\u2019d never considered the USCG. He was used to avoiding offshore storms, not flying right into them to pluck someone out of a wild sea.</p><p>He took a couple of swallows of his drink and a big bite of his sandwich, vaguely aware of a number of vehicles pulling into the outlook parking area. People were getting out of their cars and trucks and moving to the edge of the viewing area with binoculars and cameras. Personally, Coop didn\u2019t really think these mountainous boulders, covered with bird shit, were worthy of a picture, even with the orange chopper flying over them. Hovering over them...</p><p>The waves crashed against the big rocks with deadly power and the wind was really kicking up. He knew only too well how dicey hovering in wind conditions like that could be. And so close to the rocks. If anything went wrong, that helicopter might not be able to recover in time to avoid the boulders or crashing surf. Could get ugly.</p><p>Then a man in a harness emerged from the helicopter, dangling on a cable. That\u2019s when Cooper saw what the other motorists had seen before him. He put down his sandwich and dove into the truck, grabbing for the binoculars in the central compartment. He honed in on a boulder, a good forty or fifty feet tall, and what had been specks he now recognized as two human beings. One was on top of the rock, squatting to keep from being blown over in the wind. The other was clinging to the face of the rock.</p><p>Rock climbers? They both wore what appeared to be wet suits under their climbing gear. Thanks to the binoculars, he could see a small boat bouncing in the surf, moving away from the rock. There was a stray rope anchored to the rock and flapping in the breeze. The man who squatted on top of the boulder had issues with not only the crosswind but the helicopter\u2019s rotor wash. And if the pilot couldn\u2019t keep his aircraft stable, the EMT or rescue swimmer who dangled from the cable would slam into the rock.</p><p>\u201cEasy, easy, easy,\u201d he muttered to himself, wishing the crew could hear him.</p><p>The emergency medical tech grabbed on to the wall of the rock beside the stranded climber, stabilized himself with an anchor in the stone, and held there for a minute. Then the climber hoisted himself off the wall of the rock and onto the EMT, piggyback to the front of the harnessed rescuer. Both of them were pulled immediately up to the copter via the cable and quickly yanked within.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he whispered. Good job! He\u2019d like to know the weight of that pilot\u2019s balls\u2014that was some fancy flying. Reaching the climber was the hard part. Rescuing the guy up top was going to be less risky for all involved. The chopper backed away from the rock slightly while victim number one was presumably stabilized. Then, slowly edging near the rock once more, hovering there, a rescue basket was deployed. The climber on top waited until the basket was right there before he stood, grabbed it and fell inside. As he was being pulled up, motorists around Cooper cheered.</p><p>Before the climber was pulled all the way into the chopper, the boat below crashed against the mountainous boulder and broke into pieces. It left nothing but debris on the water. These guys must have tried to anchor the boat to a rock on a side that wasn\u2019t battered by big waves, so they could climb up, then back down. But once the boat was lost, so were they.</p><p>Who had called the Coast Guard? Probably one of them, from a cell phone. Likely the one on top of the rock, who wasn\u2019t hanging on for dear life.</p><p>Everyone safely inside, the helicopter rose, banked and shot away out to sea.</p><p>And that, ladies and gentlemen, concludes our matinee for today. Join us again tomorrow for another show, Coop thought. As the other motorists slowly departed, he finished his sandwich, then got back into his truck and headed north.</p><p>It was a good thing Cooper\u2019s GPS was up-to-date, because Gibbons Road was unmarked. It was three hours later that Coop found himself on a very narrow two-lane road that went switchback-style down a steep hill. At a turnoff, there was only a sign that read Cheap Drinks, and an arrow pointing left. Very classy, he found himself thinking. Ben had never been known as what Cooper\u2019s Southern grandmother had called \u201cHigh Cotton.\u201d</p><p>From that turnoff, however, he could see the lay of Thunder Point, and it was beautiful. A very wide inlet or bay, shaped like a U, was settled deeply into a high, rocky coastline. He could see Ben\u2019s place, a single building with a wide deck and stairs leading down to a dock and the beach. Beyond Ben\u2019s place, stretching out toward the ocean, was a completely uninhabited promontory. He sat there a moment, thinking about Ben\u2019s patrons taking advantage of those cheap drinks and then trying to get back up to 101. This road should be named Suicide Trail.</p><p>On the opposite side of the beach was another promontory that reached out toward the ocean, this one featuring houses all the way to the point. Cooper could only imagine the drop-dead-gorgeous view. There was a marina on that promontory, and the town itself. Thunder Point was built straight up the hill from the marina in a series of steps. He could see the streets from where he was parked. Between Ben\u2019s place and the town was only the wide, expansive beach. Looking down, he could see a woman in a red, hooded jacket and a big dog walking along the beach. She repeatedly threw a stick; the dog kept returning it. The dog was black and white, with legs like an Arabian colt.</p><p>The sun was shining and Cooper was reminded of one of Ben\u2019s emails describing his home. Oregon is mostly wet and cold all winter, except for one part around Bandon and Coos Bay that\u2019s moderate almost year-round, sunny more often than stormy. But when the storms do come into Thunder Point over the ocean, it\u2019s like one of the Seventh Wonders. The bay is protected by the hills and stays calm, keeping the fishing boats safe, but those thunderclouds can be spectacular....</p><p>Then he saw not one but two eagles circling over the point on Ben\u2019s side of the beach. It was a rare and beautiful sight.</p><p>He proceeded to the parking lot, not entirely surprised to find the Sheriff\u2019s Department SUV already there and the deputy sitting inside, apparently writing something. He was out of the car and striding toward Cooper just a few seconds later. Cooper sized him up. Deputy McCain was a young man, probably mid-thirties. He was tall, sandy-haired, blue-eyed, broad-shouldered\u2014about what you\u2019d expect.</p><p>Cooper extended a hand. \u201cDeputy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Cooper, I\u2019m sorry for your loss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to Ben?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was found at the foot of the stairs to the cellar, where he kept the bait tanks. Ben lived here\u2014he had a couple of rooms over the bar. The doors weren\u2019t locked, but I don\u2019t think Ben ever locked up. There were no obvious signs of foul play, but the case was turned over to the coroner. Nothing was missing, not even the cash. The coroner ruled it an accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the guy who called me said he\u2019d been killed,\u201d Cooper said.</p><p>\u201cI think Rawley was upset. He was kind of insistent that Ben couldn\u2019t have fallen. But Ben had had a couple of drinks. Not nearly the legal limit, but he could\u2019ve tripped. Hell, I\u2019ve been known to trip on no alcohol at all. Rawley found him. Ben kept the money in a cash drawer in the cooler, and the money was still in its hiding place. The one strange thing is,\u201d the deputy said, scratching the back of his neck, \u201ctime of death was put at two in the morning. Ben was in his boxers, and Rawley insisted there\u2019s no reason he\u2019d get out of bed on the second floor and head for the cellar in the middle of the night. Rawley might be right\u2014except this could have been the night Ben heard a noise and was headed for the beach. Just in case you\u2019re wondering, there is no surveillance video. In fact, the only place in town that actually has a surveillance camera is the bank. Ben has had one or two characters in his place over the years, but never any real trouble.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible someone who knew the place decided to rob it after midnight? When Ben was vulnerable?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost of Ben\u2019s customers were regulars, or heard about the place from regulars\u2014weekend bikers, sports fishermen, that sort. Ben didn\u2019t do a huge business, but he did all right.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOn bait and Wild Turkey?\u201d</p><p>The deputy actually chuckled. \u201cBait, deli, small bar, Laundromat, cheap souvenirs and fuel. I\u2019d say of all those things, the bar and deli probably did the lion\u2019s share of the business.\u201d</p><p>Coop looked around the deputy\u2019s frame. \u201cFuel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDown on the dock. For boats. Ben used to let some of his customers or neighbors moor alongside the dock. Sometimes the wait at the marina got a little long and Ben didn\u2019t mind if people helped themselves. Since he died and the place has been locked up, the boats have found other docks\u2014probably the marina. Oh, he also had a tow truck that\u2019s parked in town, but he didn\u2019t advertise about it. That\u2019s it. There was no next of kin, Mr. Cooper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is this Rawley? The guy who called me?\u201d</p> <p>The deputy scrubbed off his hat and scratched his head. \u201cYou say you were good friends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor fifteen years. I knew he was raised by his dad, that they had a bar and bait shop here on the coast. We met in the Army. He was a helicopter mechanic and everyone called him Gentle Ben. He was the sweetest man who ever lived, all six foot six of him. I can\u2019t imagine him standing up to a robber\u2014not only would he hand over the money, he\u2019d invite the guy to dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, there you go, you might not have the more recent facts, but you knew him all right. That\u2019s the thing that makes everyone lean toward accident. That, and the lack of evidence to the contrary. No one would have to hurt Ben for a handout. You don\u2019t know about Rawley?\u201d</p><p>Cooper just shook his head.</p><p>\u201cRawley Goode is around sixty, a vet with some challenging PTSD issues. He lives down the coast, where he takes care of his elderly father, sort of. He\u2019s not real good around people. Ben gave him work. He helped out here, cleaned, stocked, ran errands, that sort of thing. He could serve customers, if no one expected conversation. People around here were used to him. I think he might\u2019ve been homeless when Ben met him, but his father has lived around here a long time. Interesting guy, not that I can say I know him. Rawley found Ben.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure Rawley didn\u2019t push him down the stairs?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRawley\u2019s a skinny little guy. The coroner didn\u2019t find any evidence to suggest Ben had been pushed. And Rawley...he was dependent on Ben. When Ben died, there wasn\u2019t anyone for us to contact. But don\u2019t worry\u2014the town gave Ben a decent send-off. He was well liked. There are better bars around here to hang out in, but people liked Ben.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I liked him, too,\u201d Cooper said, looking down. \u201cThere must\u2019ve been a will or something. Rawley wasn\u2019t the most articulate guy on the phone, but he said Ben left something for me. Could be old pictures from our Army days or something. Who do you suppose I should see about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make a few calls, check into that for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAppreciate it. And maybe you could suggest a place to hook up the fifth wheel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are several decent spots along the coast for tourists\u2014Coos Bay is a nice area. You planning to hang around?\u201d</p><p>Cooper gave a shrug. \u201cMaybe a few days, just long enough to talk to some of the folks who knew Ben, pick up whatever he left for me, pay my respects. I just want people to know\u2014he had good friends. We didn\u2019t get together a lot, and it sounds like I didn\u2019t get a lot of inside information from Ben, but we were always in touch. And since I came all this way, I want to hear about him\u2014about how people got on with him. You know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I understand. This place is locked up. No one would care if you sat here for a while, while you look around at other possibilities. No hookup for your trailer, but you\u2019d be fine for a couple of days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, maybe I\u2019ll do that. Not a bad view.\u201d</p> <p>The deputy put out his hand. \u201cI gotta run. You have my number.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Deputy McCain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoger McCain, but hardly anyone remembers that. Folks tend to call me Mac.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice meeting you, Mac. Thanks for helping out with this.\u201d</p><p>Sarah Dupre walked with Hamlet, her Great Dane, down the main street in Thunder Point to the diner. She looped his leash around the lamppost and went inside, pulling off her gloves. This was one of the things she loved about this little town\u2014there was always somewhere to stop and chat for a few minutes. She wasn\u2019t well-known around here, had only lived here a few months, but considering the way she was treated by her new friends, it was as if she\u2019d been here quite a while. If she wasn\u2019t working, she liked to take Ham down to the beach and stop off at the diner on her way home. Apparently she wasn\u2019t the only one\u2014there was always a large bowl of water for dogs by the lamppost. Twin benches on either side of the diner\u2019s front door frequently seated one or two old guys, passing time.</p><p>Gina James was behind the counter of the diner. Gina took care of almost everything at the diner except the cooking. There was another waitress at night and a couple of part-time girls, but it was a pretty small shop. Gina\u2019s mother, Carrie, was sitting on a stool at the counter, her friend Lou McCain seated beside her. Carrie owned the deli across the street. Lou was a schoolteacher who helped out with her nephew Mac\u2019s kids when she wasn\u2019t teaching. Two of said kids were in a booth, eating fries and drinking colas, an after-school treat.</p><p>Sarah said, \u201cHey,\u201d and all three women said, \u201cHey,\u201d right back.</p><p>\u201cSomething to drink? Eat?\u201d Gina asked her.</p><p>\u201cCould I have a water, please? How is everyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat can I say, it\u2019s Friday,\u201d Lou said. \u201cI won\u2019t be seeing the little bast\u2014er, darlings till Monday morning.\u201d</p><p>Sarah laughed at her. \u201cYou\u2019re going to heaven for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I died and went to hell, they\u2019d have me teaching junior high,\u201d Carrie said.</p><p>\u201cAnd if I go to hell, I\u2019ll be making pies and cakes,\u201d Lou said.</p><p>\u201cYou have a day off?\u201d Gina asked Sarah.</p><p>\u201cFor Landon\u2019s football game. I\u2019m sitting alert Saturday and Sunday, that\u2019s the price I pay for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut no one gives you any trouble about it, do they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. They like weekends off as much as anyone. And I\u2019ll gladly fly weekends if I don\u2019t have to miss Landon\u2019s games. It\u2019s not as though I have any other social life.\u201d</p><p>Carrie leaned her elbow on the diner. \u201cWish I had an exciting career like you, Sarah. Being a pilot beats my job, any day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about it,\u201d Lou said.</p><p>Before Gina could weigh in, the door to the diner opened, the bell tinkling. Ray Anne appeared in her version of a Realtor\u2019s business suit\u2014too short, too tight, too much boobage. She scowled. \u201cSarah, that dog should be on a leash!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is, Ray Anne.\u201d She leaned back on her stool to look out the glass pane in the door. \u201cHe\u2019s all hooked up.\u201d</p><p>She wiped at her purple skirt. \u201cHe still managed to get me with that awful mouth of his.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Ray Anne, you\u2019re just so edible-looking,\u201d Lou said.</p><p>\u201cHa-ha. Well, you\u2019ll never guess what I just saw! The most gorgeous man, out at Ben\u2019s place. He was built like a brick you-know-what\u2014worn jeans, torn in all the right places, plain old T-shirt under a leather jacket. One of those flying jackets, you know, Sarah. Driving one of those testosterone trucks, pulling a trailer... Handsome face, maybe a dimple, scratchy little growth on his cheeks and chin. He was talking to Mac. It was like an ad for Calvin Klein.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat were you doing out at Ben\u2019s?\u201d Lou asked.</p><p>\u201cI was checking on a rental up the hill two blocks. You know, that old Maxwell place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen how\u2019d you see the tears in his jeans and his stubble?\u201d</p><p>Ray Anne dipped a manicured hand into her oversize purse and pulled out her binoculars. She smiled conspiratorially and gave her head a toss. Her short blond hair didn\u2019t move.</p><p>\u201cClever,\u201d Lou said. \u201cMan-watching taken to the next level. How old is this hunk of burning love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIrrelevant,\u201d Ray Anne said. \u201cI wonder what he\u2019s doing here. I heard Ben had no next of kin. You don\u2019t suppose cuddly old Ben was hiding a handsome brother? No, no, that would be cruel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Sarah asked.</p><p>\u201cBecause Ray Anne would love a shot at selling that property of Ben\u2019s,\u201d Carrie said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true,\u201d Ray Anne protested. \u201cYou know me, I only want to help if I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd bag a single man or two while you\u2019re at it,\u201d Lou said.</p><p>Ray Anne stiffened slightly. \u201cSome of us are still sexual beings, Louise,\u201d she said. \u201cA notion you might not be familiar with.\u201d As the Sheriff\u2019s Department patrol car passed slowly down the street, Ray Anne said, \u201cOh, there\u2019s Deputy Yummy Pants\u2014I\u2019m going to go ask him what\u2019s going on. If I can get past the dog!\u201d</p><p>Out the door she wiggled.</p><p>\u201cDeputy Yummy Pants?\u201d Sarah asked with a laugh in her voice.</p><p>\u201cThe teenage girls around town call him that,\u201d Lou explained drily. \u201cI don\u2019t recommend it. He hates it. Gets him all pissy. I should tell you what kind of pants Ms. Realtor of the Year has. Maybe Busy Pants.\u201d</p><p>Carrie\u2019s lips quirked. \u201cShe suggested you don\u2019t quite get the whole sexual pull. Louise.\u201d</p><p>Lou had a sarcastic twist to her lips when she said, \u201cIf she turns up dead, can I count on you girls for an alibi?\u201d Then she turned and called to her niece and nephew. \u201cHey, kids. Let\u2019s make tracks.\u201d To her friends she said, \u201cI\u2019m going to beat Yummy Pants home. Betcha I get more out of him than Busy Pants does.\u201d</p><p>Sarah hung her red slicker on the peg in the mudroom just in time to see her younger brother, Landon, coming toward the back door of their house with his duffel full of football gear. \u201cHey,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI came home to get a couple of things and grab a sandwich,\u201d he said. He bent to pet the dog. He didn\u2019t have to bend far\u2014Ham was tall. \u201cGotta get going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait a sec,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked, still petting the dog.</p><p>\u201cFor Pete\u2019s sake, can you look at me?\u201d she asked. When he straightened, heavy duffel over one shoulder, she gasped. There was a bruise on his cheekbone.</p><p>\u201cPractice,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t practice on game day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, I hope I don\u2019t get in trouble for that. A couple of us went out to run some plays, some passes, and I got nailed. It was an accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were practicing without a helmet?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cSarah, it\u2019s nothing. It\u2019s a small bruise. I could\u2019ve gotten it running into an open locker. Lighten up so you don\u2019t make me look like a girl. Are you coming to the game?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m coming. Why couldn\u2019t you be into chess or something? Choir? Band? Something that didn\u2019t involve bodies crashing into each other?\u201d</p><p>He grinned at her, the handsome smile that had once belonged to their deceased father. \u201cYou get enough sleep without me boring you to death,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you just be a flight attendant or something?\u201d</p><p>He had her there. Sarah flew search and rescue with the Coast Guard. There were those occasions that were risky. Edgy. And admittedly, that was part of what she loved best about it. \u201cI trust you\u2019ll be wearing your helmet tonight?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cFunny. It should be a good game. Raiders are a good match. They\u2019re a good team.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d she asked, touching her own cheek.</p> <p>\u201cNah, it\u2019s really nothing, Sarah. See you later.\u201d</p><p>She suppressed the urge to beg him to be careful. It was just the two of them; she was his guardian and family. She sometimes wanted to simply enfold him in her arms and keep him safe. Yet watching him play was thrilling. He was a great athlete, already six feet tall and muscled at sixteen. She\u2019d heard he was the best quarterback they\u2019d seen in a long time here in Thunder Point.</p><p>For the millionth time she hoped bringing him here had been a good decision. He\u2019d been happy in the North Bend high school last year. He\u2019d barely found his footing, his friends, when she\u2019d moved them here. But she couldn\u2019t bear to stay in the same town as her ex, in the home they had shared. It was bad enough that they still worked together.</p><p>She\u2019d moved them so often....</p><p>She reached out as if to hug him, then retracted her arms. He didn\u2019t want mush, not now that he was a man. So she held back.</p> <p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he said patiently. \u201cGet it over with.\u201d</p><p>She wrapped her arms around him and he gave her a one-armed hug back. Then he grinned at her again. He had absolutely no idea how handsome he was, which made him even more attractive.</p><p>\u201cPlay your little heart out, bud,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd do not get hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019m fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou going out after the game?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI dunno. Depends on how tired I am.\u201d</p> <p>Sarah looked at him. \u201cWhen I was your age, I was never too tired to go out. If you go out, getting home by midnight would be nice. No later than one, for sure. Are we on the same page here?\u201d</p><p>He laughed at her. \u201cSame page, boss.\u201d</p><p>But as she knew, he seldom went out after a game.</p><p>Two</p><p>Roger McCain headed home for the day. He lived in a large house he couldn\u2019t quite afford with three kids and his aunt Lou. He was thirty-six and his oldest, Eve, was sixteen. Ryan was twelve, and Dee Dee was ten. When he got home, his first stop was the gun safe in the garage. He locked up his guns before going into the house. Though his kids had been both lectured and trained, guns did not enter his house.</p><p>It was about five-thirty when he walked into the kitchen from the garage. Lou stood at the sink, rinsing dishes. Lou was not Aunt Bee to his Andy of Mayberry. She was sixty, but didn\u2019t look a day of it. She wore fitted jeans, a white silky blouse, leather vest and boots on her young, trim body. Her curly, shoulder-length hair was auburn with some gold highlights and her nails were manicured in bright colors. She complained of crow\u2019s feet and what she called a wattle under her chin, but he didn\u2019t know what she was talking about. Lou called herself his old-maid aunt\u2014she\u2019d never married or had children of her own\u2014but in truth she was young, energetic and feisty, exactly what he needed, even if it did drive him crazy at times.</p><p>Without even turning around she said, \u201cThere are tacos. The kids have eaten. Eve is going to take the van to the game tonight. She\u2019s meeting a couple of her friends. That leaves you and me and the kids to go together. In less than an hour.\u201d</p><p>Friday night. High school football. Eve was a cheerleader. A gorgeous, young cheerleader who resembled her mother and caused him to quake in fear every time he looked at her.</p> <p>\u201cDid it occur to you to ask me if I was all right with that\u2014Eve taking the van?\u201d</p><p>She turned from the sink. \u201cIt did,\u201d she said, giving him a sharp nod. \u201cIt always occurs to me. But you say no and argue and then give in so you can pace and grumble. She\u2019s sixteen and a good girl. She\u2019s earned it.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, but he hated it. His ex-wife Cee Jay\u2014short for Cecilia Jayne\u2014had been a cheerleader; he\u2019d been a football player back in Coquille. Cee Jay had gotten pregnant at sixteen. By nineteen, he\u2019d been a brand-new husband with a baby on the way.</p><p>Cee Jay left when Dee Dee was nine months old; that\u2019s when they had moved in with Lou. Cee Jay had been so young when she left\u2014only twenty-three. Mac wasn\u2019t sure why he\u2019d felt so old, as he\u2019d been only twenty-six. But he\u2019d been pretty busy, trying to support his family on two jobs. He was a rookie deputy, working nights, and by day he worked security on an armored car.</p><p>His dirty little secret was that sometimes he didn\u2019t mind the two jobs. But Cee Jay, left alone too much, scrimping to get by and buried in small children, complained a lot. There wasn\u2019t enough money, the house was small, old and falling apart, the kids were out of control, there was no fun in her life and very little attention from her husband, whom she accused of showing up only long enough to throw food down his throat and take off for the next job. She needed more money but hated that he was always working.</p><p>And then one day Cee Jay snapped. She packed a big suitcase, put the kids at the neighbor\u2019s house and waited for him to get home from his day job. \u201cI can\u2019t take it anymore,\u201d she told him. \u201cI\u2019m sick of getting puked on, sick of the diapers and noise, sick of this dump we live in, tired of not being able to get out of the grocery store with ten cents left in my purse. I\u2019ve had enough. I\u2019m leaving.\u201d</p><p>For the past nine years, he had asked himself why he\u2019d been stunned. Her complaints hadn\u2019t changed, they\u2019d just been accompanied by a suitcase. \u201cL-leaving?\u201d he had stuttered.</p><p>\u201cThe kids are next door,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m taking my clothes and two hundred dollars.\u201d</p><p>His entire body had vibrated with fear. Dread. Pain. \u201cCee Jay, you can\u2019t do this to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, you did it to me first. I was sixteen, Mac. Sixteen and pregnant!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you were happy! And you wanted Ryan\u2014you argued for Ryan! Dee Dee was an accident, but you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you thought that I had a clue, at sixteen or twenty-two?\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, I was only nineteen! So\u2014we were too young, you think I don\u2019t know that? You can\u2019t just leave your children!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no way to support them and I can\u2019t take this anymore!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCee Jay, how\u2019m I supposed to work and take care of the kids?\u201d</p><p>He remembered the sound of a horn honking. She zipped her bag. \u201cI don\u2019t know, but you\u2019ll figure it out. Call your aunt\u2014she always hated me anyway.\u201d</p><p>He had grabbed her by the shoulders and shaken her. It was the harshest hand he\u2019d ever laid to a woman. \u201cAre you crazy? What is this? Is that some guy picking you up?\u201d</p><p>When he stopped shaking her, she said, \u201cThere\u2019s no guy! That\u2019s a cab! You want me to call the cops? Let go of me!\u201d</p><p>Of course there was a guy. It took him all of three weeks to figure it out\u2014some pro golfer. At first, the mystery was how she had found the time to have enough of a relationship with him to talk him into taking her away. But he caught on\u2014girlfriends. Young mothers like Cee Jay, running around, swapping kids, stealing time for themselves. Once Mac learned his name and began following his movements through the news, the second mystery followed: why she didn\u2019t come home to her family once the relationship was over, which took only a month or so.</p><p>He fantasized how he wouldn\u2019t make her beg much, just enough to be sure she had had a change of heart and was ready to commit, ready to promise never to do it again. No one could ever know the depth of humiliation at not being able to hang on to the mother of your children. At the time he had lived in Coquille, and it took roughly forty-eight hours for everyone who\u2019d ever heard of him to be talking about how Cee Jay McCain left her young husband and three small children to run off with a golf pro. He spent the next five years nurturing a fantasy that she\u2019d eventually come to her senses and be back, if only to see her children. Then it finally dawned on him to be afraid of that very scenario\u2014that once he\u2019d figured out how to manage, she\u2019d stalk back in and stake some kind of claim. So he got himself a divorce. He had to locate her to do that\u2014she turned up in Los Angeles. They didn\u2019t communicate. She signed the papers, relinquished custody and he let go except for a couple of tiny threads. He hated her for what she\u2019d done to their children. And he was terrified of ever getting involved with a woman again.</p><p>It was with the divorce that they moved to the outskirts of Thunder Point, about thirty minutes east to Coquille, the sheriff\u2019s office. Even if Mac had to go back to the central office, he could commute. It was here, in a down economy, that he managed to find a larger home, one big enough for his family\u2014three kids, Aunt Lou and two Labs.</p><p>Since Mac had lost his parents young and had lived with Lou during junior high and high school, you\u2019d think she\u2019d be as terrified as he was that Eve would slip and fall into some horny football player\u2019s lap and end up with the mess of a life her mother had. They had never talked about it; it had never been voiced. But they both knew what was eating Mac. He wanted Eve to be twenty-seven, settled and safe. Real. Fast.</p><p>And just then his daughter dashed through the kitchen, wearing her barely there cheerleading uniform. Short, pleated skirt, V-neck sweater, letter jacket, long, beautiful legs, and a head full of thick dark hair she wore down most of the time. She had the biggest blue eyes. Her smile was positively hypnotizing; he\u2019d barely paid off the orthodontist\u2019s bill, just in time to start on the next two mouths. Blue eyes ran in their genes but not perfect teeth. If not for the dental benefits offered by the Sheriff\u2019s Department, his kids would have teeth growing out of their ears.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wave to you at the game, Daddy,\u201d she said, rising on her toes to kiss his cheek. \u201cWe\u2019re going out after,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cMidnight, Eve,\u201d he reminded her. As if she couldn\u2019t get into trouble before midnight. It wasn\u2019t that. It was just that it was all he could take. He needed his kids home and tucked in so he could relax.</p><p>\u201cHow often have I been late?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few times,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWell, not very late,\u201d she reminded him. Then she beamed. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to kick some Raider tail tonight!\u201d</p><p>And he grinned at her. She was his doll; he\u2019d die for her, it was that simple.</p><p>When she was out the door, Lou was shaking her head. \u201cI wish you\u2019d get a life,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThis is my life,\u201d he said, and sat at the table, commencing to build himself some tacos.</p><p>\u201cYou need a little more going on. Like a woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? You have somewhere to go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just might,\u201d she challenged.</p><p>\u201cWell, knock yourself out,\u201d he said. \u201cI can manage.\u201d</p><p>She laughed at him. \u201cI\u2019d love to see that,\u201d she said. She pulled a cold cola out of the fridge for him and sat at the table with him. \u201cTell me about the crime in Thunder Point, Mac. I haven\u2019t heard anything interesting all day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell now,\u201d he said, sprinkling cheese on top of four large tacos. \u201cNo interesting crime, but an old friend of Ben Bailey\u2019s came to town, wanting to know what happened to him. He\u2019s sitting in his fifth wheel out at the bar. Says he\u2019s going to hang around a few days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRay Anne mentioned something about that. She\u2019s not one to miss a new man in town.\u201d Lou clucked and shook her head. \u201cStill can\u2019t believe Ben\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one can believe it,\u201d Mac said. Then he dove into his first taco.</p><p>Cooper moved his trailer around to the far side of Ben\u2019s bar on the parking tarmac, pretty much out of sight of the road to 101. The small parking lot could only accommodate twenty or thirty cars, but he discovered a road toward the front of the structure that led to the beach. More of a downhill driveway, really. The road to the beach looked much kinder than that trip up Bailey Pass and Gibbons to the highway. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>He roamed around the locked-up property, peeking in windows. The newest and nicest part of the whole structure was an impressive deck, complete with tables and chairs surrounding the two sides of the building with a view. But a look through the windows revealed what he considered a dump. There was a long bar lined with stools, liquor bottles on the shelf, but only a half-dozen small tables. Life preservers, nets, shells and other seaside paraphernalia hung from the walls. A few turning racks of postcards and souvenirs sat about. The place looked like it hadn\u2019t been improved in years. He could see the dust and grime from the window. This came as no surprise. Ben had been kind and generous to a fault, good with engines and just about anything mechanical, but he wasn\u2019t exactly enterprising. He could be a little on the lazy side, unless he had an engine maintenance job to do. And he hadn\u2019t been too good with money; he spent what he had. When Cooper first met him, he was living a cash existence, just like his father had. He sure hadn\u2019t been classy. Cheap Drinks. Just a kindhearted good old boy.</p><p>Cooper unloaded the WaveRunner, his all-terrain vehicle\u2014the Rhino\u2014and his motorcycle. There was a large metal shed at the end of the parking lot, up against the hill, but it was padlocked. He stored his toys under a tarp, locked up in chains so they couldn\u2019t be stolen without a blowtorch and trailer.</p> <p>He wandered down to the beach to the dock. There was a fueling tank perched on the end and a paved boat launch. He wondered if Ben had a boat in the shed, which was as big as a garage. The sun was lowering and it was getting damn cold on the water, unlike the Southern climate he\u2019d come from. He encountered a few people out walking or jogging and gave a nod. He was glad he carried a Glock in his back waistband, under his jacket. After all, he was alone out here, no one knew him, and he still had reservations about Ben falling down the stairs. Big man like Ben, you\u2019d think he\u2019d have survived even a steep fall with only some bruises. Worst case, a broken bone.</p><p>With night beginning to fall, he headed back to the toy hauler. He\u2019d have time to explore Thunder Point tomorrow. He figured he\u2019d relax, get a good night\u2019s sleep and get to know the men and women who\u2019d been Ben\u2019s friends in the morning.</p><p>But at around eleven, he heard the noise of people talking. He put on his jacket, gun tucked in his waistband, and went outside. He brought the binoculars from the truck, wandered around the deck. The waterfront had come alive. He saw kids on the beach, partying around a couple of campfires. From the shouts and squeals, they were teenagers. A set of headlights from clear on the other side of the beach near the town brought it all together. Ben\u2019s place was probably most often accessed from the beach side, especially at night. Sure enough, the headlights he saw pulled right up on the sand, next to a row of all-terrain vehicles\u2014Rhinos, quads, dune buggies.</p><p>Yep, this was a beach bar. Complete with Laundromat, bait and gas for boats. It all made sense now\u2014in winter and bad weather, Ben likely had moderate sales, but in summers he probably did a brisk business. Folks from Thunder Point, on the other side of the beach, stopping for a soda or morning coffee when they were out walking their dogs; people from the town driving over in beach buggies to have a drink on the deck at sunset. Sport fishermen or sailors could start or end their days here.</p><p>Cooper was a little bit sorry he wasn\u2019t going to be around to watch the summer storms roll in over the Pacific. Or the whales migrating in spring and fall. Whales wouldn\u2019t be in the bay, but he was willing to bet the view was great from either the far edge of the cliff or the point on the opposite side of the bay.</p> <p>This would have appealed to Ben for a million reasons. It was his father\u2019s and he\u2019d spent years here. The view was fantastic, and no one liked to put his feet up and relax more than Ben Bailey.</p><p>There was some loud popping and shrieking on the beach and he automatically reached for that Glock, but it was followed by laughter. Firecrackers. Then there was some chanting. Go, Cougars, Go. Go, Cougars, Go. Go, Go, Get \u2019Em, Get \u2019Em, Go, Get \u2019Em, Go!</p><p>Cheers. That\u2019s what was going on. It was October. Football and teenagers. This was what coastal kids did after a game and probably all summer long. Coop had spent many of his early years on the Gulf, but by the time he was a teenager his parents had moved inland, away from the water to Albuquerque, New Mexico. Cooper and his friends often went out to the remote desert, away from the prying eyes of adults where they could build a fire, drink a few beers, make out with their girlfriends.</p><p>What a perfect setup. There was a whole coastline all the way to Canada, but this little piece of it didn\u2019t have easy access. You either came at it by way of Ben\u2019s or from the town, on foot or armed with a beach mobile. There wouldn\u2019t be many strangers around.</p><p>He went back to his camper and settled in\u2014door locked, gun handy. He let the TV drown out the noise from the kids until it faded away. In the morning he brewed coffee and took a cup with him to the dock, then the beach. Although he had no investment in this place, he found himself hoping they had cleaned up after themselves and hadn\u2019t left trash all over the beach.</p><p>And what do you know? There were a couple of big green trash cans with lids up against the hill, full of bottles, cans, snack wrappers, spent firecrackers. The tide had taken out the remnants of a fire. Except for being raked, the beach was cleaned up. Who were these kids? The Stepford teenagers?</p> <p>He took a deep breath of foggy sea air and decided he\u2019d shower and hit the town. He\u2019d like to know a little more about this place.</p><p>Cooper thought about taking the Rhino across the beach to the town, but instead he took the truck back up to 101, just to check out the distance. The freeway curved east, to the right, away from the town, and it was five miles before he saw a small sign for Thunder Point. Then it was a left turn and another five miles to access the town. He was about a mile, maybe mile and a half across the beach, or ten miles on the road.</p><p>Heading into Thunder Point from 101, he passed the high school\u2014circa 1960s\u2014on the edge of town. Not too big, he noted. Then he came to the main street, Indigo Sea Drive.</p><p>He had passed through a hundred towns like this, maybe a thousand. There wasn\u2019t a lot of commerce\u2014dry cleaner, bakery, diner. There was a very small library at the end of the street. Next to it, the elementary and middle schools sat side by side. He spotted a secondhand clothing store right next to a thrift shop and wondered what the difference was. There was a grocery, liquor store, pharmacy, gas station, hardware store and small motel. There was a dingy-looking bar, Waylan\u2019s. And yes, Fresh Fish. There was also McDonald\u2019s, Taco Bell, Subway and Carrie\u2019s Deli and Catering. The Sheriff\u2019s Department was a small storefront that sat between the deli and a boarded-up store, although a man was tearing the boards off one large window. New business moving in? Cooper wondered.</p><p>Driving around, he discovered four roads that ran downhill to the beach or marina, through the neighborhoods that surrounded the main street. The beach and the bay were like a basin dug out of the land. All roads seemed to lead either up or down\u2014down to the marina, up to the main street, down to the beach, up to Bailey\u2019s.</p><p>It appeared the main street and marina were the life of the town. Most of the slips were empty\u2014fishing boats, out early in the morning, he assumed. He saw two boat-launch ramps and a fueling station. There were a number of small fishing and pleasure boats still tied up and one big cabin cruiser. There was a restaurant\u2014Cliffhanger\u2019s, which also advertised a bar\u2014at the far end of the marina, far enough up the hill to avoid high tides and flooding.</p><p>He went back to the main street and drove west, out onto the point. There were houses out there, as well. On the end of the promontory was a very large home with a gated driveway. Whoever owned that house got the best view imaginable, as the point was a high, rocky cliff. From Ben\u2019s deck he had noticed a small lighthouse, somewhere below this mansion.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t exactly a cute little town, but there were some nice touches, like big pots of flowers in front of some businesses, old-fashioned lampposts, benches here and there along wide sidewalks.</p> <p>He reasoned the best places to perch for local news would be one of the bars or the local diner. Cliffhanger\u2019s wasn\u2019t open yet. Waylan\u2019s probably was, but he wasn\u2019t in the mood for a seedy bar. He went to the diner and sat at the counter. It was either designed to be retro or it was fifty years old. By the cracks in the linoleum floor, he guessed it was all about age. The waitress was there in a flash, with a coffeepot in her hand. Her blond hair was in a ponytail and she wore a black-and-white-checkered blouse. Her name tag said Gina.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Gina,\u201d he said.</p><p>She filled his cup. \u201cAnd good morning, strange man. Hungry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs a matter of fact, I am. What have you got for eggs?\u201d Cooper asked.</p><p>She put down the coffeepot and leaned both hands on the counter. With a wide smile, she said, \u201cIt\u2019s the darnedest thing, we have eggs for eggs.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t suppress a grin. \u201cMess up a couple for me. Toast, too, and...you have sausage for sausage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLink or patty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPatty,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhole wheat or whole wheat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t I live recklessly? Whole wheat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood choice. It\u2019s better for you. Now drink that coffee slow so I don\u2019t have to keep coming back here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould I have some ice water?\u201d He looked around. The small diner was empty of customers. \u201cIf it\u2019s not too much trouble?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s extra,\u201d she said. She turned and slapped the ticket on the cook\u2019s counter.</p><p>\u201cI can afford it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it might cut into your tip.\u201d</p><p>She fixed up an ice water and placed it before him. \u201cIf it\u2019s going to cut into my tip, I won\u2019t charge you for it. You think I work here for the wages?\u201d She gave the counter a wipe. \u201cI know you\u2019re not just passing through\u2014there\u2019s only two ways into this town, and both are inconvenient.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo ways?\u201d he asked, confident she was going to tell him about Gibbons to Bailey\u2019s, down the hill, or Indigo Sea Drive, right through the heart of town.</p><p>\u201cBy land or by sea,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are en route to nowhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am, though. Passing through. Ben Bailey was a friend of mine and I just heard\u2014\u201d</p><p>She got a stricken look on her face. \u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry! Man, we miss Ben around here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m hanging around\u2014to meet some of his friends. Ben and I met in the Army, a long time ago. We stayed in touch, but I\u2019ve never been up here before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBen was such a nice guy\u2014the last person I could imagine losing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho were his closest friends?\u201d Cooper asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, hell, no one and everyone,\u201d she said with a shrug. \u201cBen kind of watched over the whole town, but I don\u2019t know of any one or two people he was best friends with.\u201d</p><p>The door opened and Mac came in. He wasn\u2019t in uniform this morning and looked just as comfortable in jeans, boots, plaid shirt and jacket.</p><p>\u201cThis is the guy you should probably ask,\u201d Gina said. \u201cHey, Mac.\u201d</p><p>He pulled off his cap and sat next to Cooper at the counter. \u201cAsk me what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis guy was a friend of Ben\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve met,\u201d Mac said, sticking out a hand. \u201cHow\u2019s it going, Mr. Cooper?\u201d</p><p>Cooper laughed. \u201cEvery time you call me Mr. Cooper, I wonder if my father just entered the room. My name\u2019s actually Hank, short for Henry, but people call me Cooper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that a military thing? Last name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt started way before the Army. I\u2019m a junior\u2014Henry Davidson Cooper, Junior. My dad goes by Hank, but no one went for Henry or little Hank so I got saddled with Little Cooper until I wasn\u2019t so little, then just Cooper. Sometimes Coop. Take your pick. It\u2019s going all right. That beach can get busy at night.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cKids,\u201d Mac confirmed. \u201cThey behave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot only did they behave, they cleaned up.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, you can give Ben credit for that. That whole stretch of beach right up to the town and marina is...was his. He let it go public. He\u2019d walk down there from time to time when it was real active, a bunch of kids, and inform them in his way that the minute he had to clean up the beach after campers or partiers, he\u2019d have a fence erected and close it. He put out trash cans and once a week or so he\u2019d check to see if they needed emptying. He had rules for his beach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe policed the beach?\u201d Cooper asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but it was more about the wildlife than saving him work. He didn\u2019t want things like plastic bags or rings from six-packs left in the sand or washing out with the tide, killing fish or getting picked up by a bird and causing harm, like strangling it. Or choking it. About once a year he\u2019d post a couple of Private Property signs, kind of a warning or a reminder. Word spread about his place, his beach. He had regular motorcycle or cycling groups come through in summer, he called them his weekend warriors. He had a real scary-looking gang camping on the beach once but he confronted them, told them it was his property and they were welcome to use it if there were no firearms, no underage drinking, no drugs, didn\u2019t give the town any trouble and if they threw away their trash so it wouldn\u2019t harm wildlife.\u201d Mac shook his head as he laughed. \u201cHe never bothered to call in reinforcements\u2014I heard about the riders the next day, but Ben never called me. The riders kept it cool, threw away their trash and thanked him for the use of his beach. He had a way about him, you know? That incident was a long time ago and according to Ben and folks in town, in the end they were a docile bunch. Ben\u2019s place usually attracted more graybeards, out for the weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGraybeards?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOlder riders\u2014minimum age fifty or so. Ben was a pretty easygoing guy and nothing scared him. He always got along with anyone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know,\u201d Cooper said.</p><p>Gina put Cooper\u2019s breakfast in front of him and refilled his coffee cup.</p><p>\u201cGood call on the eggs,\u201d Mac said. \u201cYou tell him?\u201d he asked Gina.</p><p>\u201cNope. It was his first choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBurgers here are great,\u201d Mac said. \u201cSandwiches are pretty good, soup has good days, meat loaf is terrible\u2014don\u2019t know why Stu keeps making it, no one in this town is fool enough to eat it. It\u2019s god-awful. He just fries the hell out of eggs, so either get \u2019em scrambled, over hard, omelet or hard-boiled. In fact, anything he can just fry to death or broil is pretty good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t the owner get a better cook?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe owner is the cook, that\u2019s the primary reason,\u201d Gina said. Then, looking at Mac, she asked, \u201cEveryone get to where they\u2019re going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEve and Ashley are at cheerleading practice, Ryan\u2019s at football and Lou took Dee Dee to dance. Just so you know, Eve and Ashley went in your mother\u2019s car.\u201d</p><p>Gina nodded but had a grave look on her face.</p><p>\u201cYou two...?\u201d Cooper started to ask.</p><p>\u201cSingle parents,\u201d Gina said. \u201cOur daughters are best friends. Most of the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you back each other up?\u201d Cooper asked, shoveling some eggs in his mouth.</p><p>\u201cLotta back up,\u201d Mac explained. \u201cMy aunt lives with me, Gina\u2019s mother lives with her. It takes a village...where have I heard that before. You married, Cooper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. No one would have me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s because you live out of a toy hauler, ever think of that?\u201d Mac asked.</p><p>Cooper grinned. \u201cCould be. Well, now that I have the lay of the land, I can get eggs and coffee a lot easier. Straight across the beach in the Rhino. Except, I think I got what I came for\u2014I wanted to know what the hell happened to Ben. Have I heard everything I\u2019m going to hear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe coroner ruled on it, but I\u2019m keeping my eyes open. It\u2019s not an open case, but this is my town and Ben was a good guy. If I hear anything suspicious, I\u2019ll be investigating myself,\u201d Mac said.</p><p>\u201cWhat about this Rawley Goode?\u201d Cooper asked.</p><p>\u201cWeird Rawley?\u201d Gina asked with a curl of her lip.</p><p>\u201cAw, Rawley\u2019s got his troubles,\u201d Mac said. \u201cI just hope he doesn\u2019t wander off, now that Ben\u2019s gone and the place is closed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was kind of hoping he would wander off,\u201d Gina said.</p><p>\u201cYou have a problem with Rawley?\u201d Cooper asked.</p><p>\u201cI have a problem with the way he looks you in the eye like he can see straight through you and says ab-so-lutely nothing. It\u2019s creepy.\u201d</p><p>Mac chuckled. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty much why Ben gave him a dishrag and a broom and some kitchen chores. They seemed to understand each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis place\u2014everyone works together, understands each other, cleans up after each other, a regular Stepford...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have as many idiots, assholes and troublemakers as any town, but you know what the difference is between this town and any other town?\u201d</p><p>Cooper leaned his head on his hand. \u201cI can\u2019t wait. What\u2019s the difference?\u201d</p><p>Mac pushed his coffee cup toward Gina for a refill. \u201cI know who they are.\u201d</p><p>Three</p><p>Cooper learned a few things about the town and Ben. Ben had helped Gina keep her old Jeep running, for one thing, and never charged her except for parts. He\u2019d bought ads for the backs of kids\u2019 soccer and Little League team jerseys\u2014Bailey\u2019s Bait Shop. He had a bird sanctuary on his land that stretched all the way out to the high, rocky cliffs above the ocean. In addition to the eagles, there were seabirds who lived off the water but returned inland to nest, mate and lay eggs. Cooper remembered Ben emailing him something about that, more than once.</p><p>Ben apparently hadn\u2019t done particularly social things, like volunteer as assistant coach for kids\u2019 teams, but he attended town gatherings and meetings and ate out at the diner and Cliffhanger\u2019s. He contributed a lot, not the least of which was the beach. This was the Ben that Cooper had known\u2014not shy or antisocial, but satisfied with his own company. He hadn\u2019t had a long career in the Army, just a few years. As Coop\u2019s helicopter mechanic at Fort Rucker, he was meticulous and verged on extraordinary, but he had issues with rules, probably one of the reasons Cooper took to him. \u201cBailey, where\u2019s your hat?\u201d \u201cIn my pocket, sir!\u201d \u201cWhy isn\u2019t it on your head?\u201d \u201cBecause I can\u2019t get my head in my pocket, sir!\u201d</p><p>He learned the marina was small in comparison to others in the region. The crabbers and fishermen who docked there lived in the town, but took most of their catch to larger harbors, although they kept some of it to sell to locals or to Cliffhanger\u2019s. Some of the commercial fishermen had been in business for generations. The marina also held sport and pleasure boats, mostly used by Thunder Point\u2019s residents. The bay was a safe, quiet place, protected by the promontories from hostile weather.</p><p>When Cooper parted ways with Mac after his breakfast, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s much reason for me to hang around, except maybe the view from Ben\u2019s deck. What will happen to his place?\u201d</p><p>Mac shrugged. \u201cNot sure. Maybe there will be a search for a next of kin, or maybe it\u2019ll sit until it\u2019s in default of liens or taxes, then auctioned. That\u2019s not Sheriff\u2019s Department business. Damn shame, though. People enjoyed the beach, the bar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s pretty run-down,\u201d Cooper pointed out.</p><p>\u201cIf you think the outside is a little tired-looking, you should see inside. Well, people didn\u2019t have real high expectations of the place, but it served a purpose. You may have noticed, it\u2019s not a fancy town.\u201d</p><p>Mac already had Cooper\u2019s cell number, but in a gesture of friendliness, he gave Cooper his before they said goodbye at the diner.</p><p>Since Cooper had no plans or pressing business, he spent a couple of days just driving around the area\u2014up to Coos Bay, into the hills, to the casino in North Bend\u2014keeping his trailer as a home base. One sunny afternoon, he got out his laptop and found a chair on Ben\u2019s deck, facing the bay. In just a few days, he\u2019d come to the conclusion the damp, foggy morning was typical of the Oregon Coast. Sunshine usually arrived midmorning, at the latest, but it was cold enough this October afternoon to require a jacket. Before he opened his laptop and logged on, he saw her again\u2014the woman and her dog. She threw the stick and waited for the large black-and-white dog to bring it back. The dog had the longest legs; he was half as tall as the woman. It was the same woman\u2014red slicker with the hood up, black knee-high rubber boots, hands plunged into her pockets while she waited for the dog. She was walking toward his end of the beach, but before she was close enough for him to get a glimpse of her face, she turned and headed back toward the town.</p><p>He logged on, checking his email, looking up from time to time to watch the progress of the woman and dog. She was too far away for him to be taken by her looks, but he was intrigued nonetheless. There was something about her that was so...lonely. They probably had that in common. Cooper had no trouble getting to know people or making friends, yet he rarely did. He was a loner; he knew that about himself. It didn\u2019t take much to turn a man solitary\u2014being the new guy too often, being controversial now and then, a couple of unsuccessful attempts at a lasting relationship with a woman....</p><p>He sent a note to Luke Riordan\u2014they\u2019d been a scrappy pair of combat-ready helicopter pilots fifteen years ago and Ben had been their mechanic. Not too surprisingly, Ben had been the most stable of the threesome. So Cooper filled Luke in on the details of Ben\u2019s death. Cooper described the property, the beach, the town and the fact that Ben\u2019s place might end up just being auctioned.</p><p>Then he emailed his father and his oldest sister, Rochelle, to tell them where he was, although his cell was working just fine and they could reach him if there was any family business. His parents and three married sisters lived in or near Albuquerque. When he could, he made short visits to New Mexico, but he didn\u2019t spend a lot of time there. Cooper was close to his family, but their relationship was complicated. There was a part of him that felt he\u2019d failed them by never settling down, marrying, having a family and a stable career...and there was a part of him that thought they\u2019d had unreasonable expectations and tried to push him in directions he wasn\u2019t capable of going.</p><p>He heard an engine from the highway far above. He shut down and closed his laptop. Leaving it on the chair, he walked around the deck and witnessed an old pickup come down the road from 101. Even before he saw the driver, he knew this must be Rawley. The truck was ancient enough to be a classic, but the engine ran smooth. That had to be Ben\u2019s work. The tires were new and shiny, cleaned and buffed to new-car life.</p><p>Then the guy parked and got out\u2014yes, had to be Rawley. He was a skinny, balding, grizzled man in his sixties, looking pretty worn-out, and he wore an American flag shirt with his old jeans. He had a scarf or rag bandanna tied around his head and a gray ponytail, circa the sixties. He walked right up to Cooper.</p><p>Cooper stuck out his hand. \u201cRawley?\u201d he asked.</p><p>The man\u2019s expression didn\u2019t even change. Rather than shaking Cooper\u2019s hand, he put a thick envelope in his grasp. Then he turned to go back to his truck.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>But Rawley kept walking and Cooper kept watching him. When Rawley got back to his truck, he didn\u2019t get in. He leaned against the passenger side, crossed his legs leisurely, arms folded over his chest. He gave a nod and waited.</p><p>Cooper opened the envelope and pulled out a thick document, folded in thirds. When he unfolded it, he found a will that had been drawn up by Lawrence Carnegie, Attorney-at-Law. It was pages long. But on top was a lime-green sticky note that said, \u201cTake care of things, Coop.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>He looked up at Rawley. \u201cHe wants me to take care of this?\u201d</p><p>Rawley rolled his eyes as if to say, Right, stupid. What did the note say?</p> <p>Cooper glanced through the document quickly. He\u2019d assumed that Ben wanted him as executor, but it took about two seconds to see that Ben was leaving this place to him. Looking a little further, it appeared that included the structure and the land. And the beach? The document was four pages of legalese. There was probably something in here that explained special conditions of some kind, but that was going to take a closer, slower look. Meanwhile, he became aware of a key inside the envelope.</p><p>\u201cTo the bar?\u201d he asked Rawley.</p><p>Again Rawley rolled his eyes, saying nothing.</p><p>Cooper almost eye-rolled him right back. But he took the key in one hand and the document in the other and walked around the deck to the ocean side, where he slipped it into the lock on a set of double doors that could open wide onto the deck. The seal on the doors was good, probably to protect against heavy storms or tsunamis. He pulled open the door and was immediately assaulted by the foulest smell he\u2019d ever encountered. Hadn\u2019t they said Ben had been buried? Because this smell was worse than a rotting body. It took about three steps into the bar/bait shop to realize they had septic issues, combined with what smelled like rotting fish and maybe garbage. The electricity had been turned off. He yelled, \u201cRawley!\u201d</p><p>The response he got was the sound of a truck. Departing.</p> <p>An hour later, Cooper placed a call to Mac\u2019s cell phone. It was late afternoon now and the sun was shining, which did not cheer Cooper. It not only helped cook the smells in the bar/bait shop but also brought people out to the beach, walking dogs, nosing around or jogging. It was too chilly for swimming or picnicking. At the sight of someone opening doors and windows at Ben\u2019s place, a few brave souls came close, curious. By the time they made it to the deck, they covered their noses and retreated. Quickly.</p><p>\u201cMac,\u201d Cooper said into the phone. \u201cBoy, do I have a situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStart with, Rawley brought me what seems to be a will. It\u2019ll have to be verified, but it looks in order. Ben left this place to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa. Did you see that coming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe never even hinted at such a thing. Second, there was a key and I went inside. Holy mother of God, there are too many rotten things in there to count. The electricity was turned off and his bait tank is full of dead fish, stagnant, moldy water and God knows what all. And I\u2019m pretty sure I smell septic backup. I have the doors and windows open, but the place is impenetrable. Do you know anyone? Like maybe a crime-scene cleanup crew? Or something?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a flood and environmental cleanup company up in North Bend. Also a hazardous chemical cleanup crew up there.\u201d</p><p>Cooper couldn\u2019t stop a cough. \u201cOh, yeah, definitely some hazardous chemicals in there. Got a number?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me call \u2019em,\u201d Mac said. \u201cI\u2019ll book the first available slot for an estimate. You planning on cleaning it up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not how I planned my week, but someone has to do it. I wouldn\u2019t count on Rawley. He handed me the will and a key and took off like a bat out of hell.\u201d</p><p>Mac laughed.</p><p>\u201cCome out here and take a deep breath and then laugh, sucker,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cWe might need a wrecking crew if the smell can\u2019t be conquered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I will come out. I mean, I\u2019m curious. Let me make a couple of calls on the way.\u201d</p><p>To keep from inhaling poisonous gases, Cooper took up residence on the dock. Even there, he could smell it. He was not entirely surprised when he caught sight of the Sheriff\u2019s Department SUV coming at him, not from the road but right across the beach.</p> <p>Mac pulled up to the dock and got out. He was wearing his uniform.</p><p>\u201cYou working?\u201d Cooper asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty much always working, but I don\u2019t drive the company car unless I\u2019m in uniform. It\u2019s for official business only. We have rules.\u201d He looked up the steps to the bar and wrinkled his nose. \u201cHoo, boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about it. I never took Ben for a prankster. \u2018Here, I\u2019m leaving you all my worldly goods, but you might have to torch it all.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think the will is legit?\u201d Mac asked.</p><p>Cooper pulled a thick document folded into thirds out of his back pocket and handed it to Mac. \u201cYou know Lawrence Carnegie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup. He\u2019s a lawyer in town. He takes care of some local stuff. I guess Ben hired him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAppears so. I gotta say, I never expected anything like this. Don\u2019t you tell someone if you\u2019re planning to do something like this?\u201d</p><p>Mac shrugged. \u201cI have a will and I haven\u2019t told anyone the details, mainly because I don\u2019t want my kids thinking if they kill me in my sleep they\u2019ll get a car or something. My aunt Lou, who\u2019s in charge anyway, is the executor. And hell, I don\u2019t even have anything worth leaving. Do you have a will?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing fancy,\u201d he said. \u201cI have savings. It\u2019ll be divided between my nieces and nephews if there\u2019s anything left when I go\u2014I was thinking it could help with college. And no, I never told anyone.\u201d</p><p>Mac was flipping through the few pages. \u201cI think I can explain Ben\u2019s reasoning, or at least the history behind this place. Ben\u2019s father was kind of old when Ben came back to Thunder Point. He was sick, had a stroke. That was right before I was transferred here. He was failing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember, Ben got out of the Army ten years ago or so to help his dad,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cI heard something about a store here. Obviously he wasn\u2019t real specific....\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, everything was transferred into Ben\u2019s name so that several years later, when his dad passed, there was no will, no probate, and most important, no tax issues.\u201d</p><p>Cooper put his hands in his pockets. \u201cHow would you know something like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPurely gossip, I\u2019m afraid,\u201d Mac said. \u201cThe talk is that when the old man passed, there were a lot of interested buyers who assumed these hicks who ran a run-down bait shop and bar hadn\u2019t prepared for the worst. The land is worth some money, Cooper. If there hadn\u2019t been a trust or a transfer, the inheritance tax alone could\u2019ve foreclosed Ben, forced him to sell. You know, there are a bunch of little moth-eaten towns around here, but we also have big resorts, the kind that host PGA tournaments or world-class hunting and draw some big money. And this area, oceanfront and five miles of natural beauty to the freeway, is prime for something like that. Something that could improve local economy. There are lots of people in town who wanted Ben to let it go. And, hey, you coming into the property...that might make people happy, assuming you\u2019ll just sell it.\u201d</p><p>Cooper reached into his pocket and pulled out the sticky note that had been attached to the will. Take care of things, Coop. He passed it to Mac. \u201cThat sound like he wants me to sell it?\u201d</p><p>Mac handed it right back. \u201cListen, Cooper, I know he was a friend, but unless the two of you had some kind of understanding, you gotta do what you gotta do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t he just leave it to Rawley?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I think that\u2019s pretty obvious. Rawley\u2019s a little off-kilter, if you get my drift. Besides, I don\u2019t think they were like brothers or anything\u2014Ben was helping him out, that\u2019s all. Ben did more for Rawley in the past few years than anyone has done for him in the last twenty-five.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, jeez. This just keeps getting more complicated. Do you suppose he\u2019s one of the things I\u2019m supposed to take care of?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo telling, pal. But I\u2019ve got a cleanup crew coming out first thing tomorrow to give you an estimate. If you like the price, they can start right away.\u201d</p><p>Cooper gave him an incredulous look. \u201cDid you smell that place? Is it even possible the price could be too high?\u201d</p><p>Mac laughed. \u201cMy aunt Lou is getting ready to burn some dinner. Why don\u2019t you lock the place up and join us. You can\u2019t get anything done around here tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDinner?\u201d Cooper asked. He gave a long, dubious look at that road leading up to 101. It was bad enough in daylight.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you a ride across the beach. And bring you back tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you had rules,\u201d Cooper said.</p><p>\u201cWe do. If anyone stops me or asks questions, you\u2019ll have to act arrested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, hell, you just stumbled on one of my special talents.\u201d</p><p>Dinner at the McCain house was served in a large, warm kitchen. Three kids, three adults sat at a big round table, two Labrador retrievers standing watch near the back door. Cooper shoveled the last of his spaghetti into his mouth and then wiped his plate with a piece of garlic bread. As it was on its way to his mouth, he noticed that five sets of eyes were on him. He realized he\u2019d eaten like a starving man, chuckled and tossed the bread onto his plate.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s more,\u201d Lou said.</p><p>\u201cSorry. But that was seriously delicious.\u201d</p><p>Lou laced her fingers together and, elbows braced on the table, said, \u201cI guess you don\u2019t get out much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI eat real well. It\u2019s Mac\u2019s fault. He tried to lower my expectations by saying you were burning some dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t he cute? That he thinks he has a sense of humor?\u201d Lou said, lifting one shapely eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cMay I be excused?\u201d Eve asked. \u201cAshley is coming over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Lou said. \u201cRyan and Dee Dee, your night for cleanup. I\u2019ll give your dad and Mr. Cooper coffee in the living room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw,\u201d Ryan whined. \u201cPrison Break is on! Come on, Aunt Lou...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, I have Designing Women reruns to watch in my room.\u201d Then she looked at Mac. \u201cWhen did he outgrow cartoons?\u201d</p><p>Instead of answering, Mac leaned toward Ryan. \u201cYou boning up for a prison break or working yourself into a corrections officer\u2019s slot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s awesome, Dad, they\u2019re just so stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. It\u2019s my job security,\u201d Mac said.</p><p>\u201cDishes,\u201d Lou said, standing with a plate in each hand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be glad to help,\u201d Cooper said quietly. \u201cI\u2019m much better at dishes than cooking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh, we\u2019re getting out of here.\u201d Mac stood up and poured two cups of coffee, throwing a look over his shoulder at Cooper. He lifted his eyebrows in question.</p><p>\u201cBlack,\u201d Cooper said.</p><p>Carrying two mugs, Mac left the kitchen and Cooper followed. The Labs, one black and one yellow, followed Cooper. In the living room, where there was no TV, Mac flipped a light switch with the brim of a coffee cup and the fireplace came to life. Then he waited for Cooper to choose his spot.</p><p>It was obvious where the deputy liked to roost from the shape of the cushions on the recliner. Cooper took a corner of the couch and watched as the dogs lay down, one on each side of the deputy\u2019s chair. \u201cI guess you spend a lot of time in here,\u201d he said.</p><p>Mac handed him a cup. \u201cThere\u2019s no TV or computer in here, ergo\u2014not a place the kids like to be. I sometimes have to compete with cheerleaders or dance practice, but they don\u2019t want my audience. I had the piano delivered straight to the basement. A man\u2019s gotta have a room, and hiding out in your bedroom? That\u2019s weird.\u201d</p><p>Cooper laughed. \u201cIs it now?\u201d he asked, sipping.</p><p>\u201cNot for a woman. They do it all the time. Lou can\u2019t wait to get away from us and close that door. But every time I go out on some strange call\u2014disturbance or domestic or hinky sexual assault\u2014the suspect is hiding out in his bedroom. Don\u2019t ask me why. It\u2019s just weird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s kind of perverted,\u201d Cooper said with a laugh. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cTell me about it. Few years ago, some lunatic got in a big brawl with his mother and sister, then shot at a deputy. He was totally unbalanced, just over eighteen years old and living with his parents, hiding in his bedroom where he had fifteen assault rifles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiving with his parents? And assault rifles?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know. Tell me how they thought it was okay that this kid with a screw loose had a bunch of really powerful guns. Did they ever think that was, I don\u2019t know, odd? Because I\u2019m not the best father on record, I\u2019m sure, but I know who forgot to flush around here.\u201d</p><p>Right then, Cooper thought if there was anything suspicious to know about Ben\u2019s death, Mac was a good guy to have on the case. \u201cI bet you\u2019re a good father,\u201d Cooper said, but he was still half laughing. \u201cAnd this is a nice house, Mac.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEh, I\u2019m getting used to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long have you been here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few years. Dee Dee was six\u2014she\u2019s ten now. I bought it because it could hold this crew, was solidly built and on the school bus route, not that anyone around here would even consider the bus. They all want to be driven. They consider the bus a punishment.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat can cut into your schedule.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have Lou. She\u2019s a teacher\u2014she doesn\u2019t mind dropping them off. But we have major scheduling issues for picking up because they have all kinds of after-school activities, from football practice to piano lessons. We manage, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour aunt Lou is a kick. And the spaghetti really was good. Very good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is, you\u2019re right. I\u2019m lucky there\u2019s someone who will make spaghetti for me. It\u2019s just that we\u2019ve been eating the same ten things since I was ten years old.\u201d</p><p>Aunt Lou had been cooking his meals since he was ten and was now cooking for his family? Mac must have seen his surprise, because he continued.</p><p>\u201cMy parents were killed in a car accident when I was a kid and Lou raised me the rest of the way. My wife left me with three kids when Dee Dee was nine months old. Lou has saved my life more than once.\u201d</p> <p>Cooper was speechless. His biggest worry had been the fact that he\u2019d never been able to settle down, make a relationship with a woman go the distance. He was so far from fatherhood he couldn\u2019t even fathom being dumped with three kids to raise.</p><p>\u201cThe house is big enough, with a generous yard, near a town small enough to know everyone. If I were a rich man, I\u2019d have a house with a view of the ocean, but up high. Not something ridiculous, just a roomy, airy house with a lot of windows. You probably haven\u2019t been around long enough to wonder why this place is called Thunder Point but the way the storm clouds come into the bay, the way the lightning flashes over the water...\u201d He shook his head. \u201cThis is a really beautiful place. Sometimes I take the squad car out to the spot where the Cheap Drinks sign is and sit on the hill and watch the weather over the bay. Or watch the sunset. Or the fog lift and the sunbeams streak through.\u201d</p><p>Coop thought about everything Mac had told him for a minute. This man had had mega challenges that Cooper had never faced. Being orphaned? Being left a single father with not one but three children? And looking so regular? Acting so normal, like it was just one foot in front of the other.</p><p>But all Cooper said was, \u201cThis seems to be a good house.\u201d</p><p>Mac replied, \u201cIt\u2019s good enough for us.\u201d</p><p>While a couple of representatives from a cleanup company wandered through the bait shop, Cooper went to the dock and called the lawyer whose name appeared on the letterhead of Ben\u2019s will. He explained what he\u2019d found on Ben\u2019s property. \u201cBefore I write a check for the cleanup, I should know whether this will that I\u2019ve been in possession of for less than twenty-four hours is legitimate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely ironclad. If you read it carefully, you\u2019ll find that everything is held in the Bailey Oceanfront Trust. There is a thirty-thousand-dollar lien you\u2019ll have to assume, however. He borrowed against the land to pay for the tow truck. Borrowed, rather than selling off any land. It\u2019s a considerable parcel, Mr. Cooper. Mr. Bailey didn\u2019t have any investments and very little in the way of savings, but he didn\u2019t like having bills. There\u2019s some cash set aside for property tax.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you suppose he bought a tow truck?\u201d Cooper asked.</p> <p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t tell you. He said he needed it. You have over two hundred acres that includes beachfront, Mr. Cooper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOver two hundred?\u201d he asked in shock.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what county records show. I recommend you have the land surveyed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoly Jesus!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I said, considerable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cBen Bailey acted like a poor boy with a bait shop!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs far as I know, he didn\u2019t have much money. Ben, and his father before him, were land poor.\u201d</p><p>Just land? Just a couple hundred acres, including beautiful beachfront property? From where Cooper stood on the dock, he could look west to the ocean and the vast promontory; south to the rocky, hilly landscape dotted with Douglas fir; east to more hills with some bad roads leading to the highway; and north across the beautiful beach to the small town and marina. He\u2019d have to see a map, but from where he stood he couldn\u2019t understand why Ben hadn\u2019t done anything more ambitious than keep the lights on. Why hadn\u2019t he cashed in at least a piece of it and built himself a decent house! Why hadn\u2019t he found himself a good woman and settled down? Ben was a couple of years older than Cooper, right around forty. And what had he done with himself?</p><p>Cooper looked out at the land mass south of the bay. That would be the bird sanctuary. Cooper hadn\u2019t even walked out there. Would the birds give the land up for a big house with a drop-dead view? But maybe Ben, like Cooper, didn\u2019t want to be tied to a big house that just had to be kept in repair. And cleaned. And would echo.</p><p>But the stretch of beach from the town all the way to the tip of Ben\u2019s land would accommodate a resort with at least a thousand rooms or a few hundred villas or condos...maybe even a golf course. How would that look, right up against an ordinary town with a bunch of fishing boats in the marina?</p><p>It would look, he thought, like a major payday.</p><p>\u201cMr. Cooper.\u201d A man holding a clipboard signaled him. He was all suited up, a face mask hanging around his neck, wearing heavy-duty rubber gloves. These guys looked like escapees from a hazmat team, Cooper thought, but then they must run into a lot of real bad stuff like floods and fires. Homicide? Cooper went up the stairs and met him on the deck, wrinkling his nose. \u201cYou got problems,\u201d the man said. \u201cYou got rot, mold, septic backup, plumbing is going bad, and then there\u2019s the smell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds terrible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo termites,\u201d he said with a lame smile.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you recommend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t turn over a good property to you unless we pretty much gut it. It needs a new septic system, plumbing repairs, and we can\u2019t get at that mold without tearing out some walls and flooring. The good news is, you have some water-damaged, rotting wood that would have to go anyway, so you kill two birds with one stone. You let us tear out the old wood to get to the mold and we\u2019ll only charge you once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t plan to keep it. So now what do you recommend?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYou could raze it,\u201d he said. \u201cSell the lot it\u2019s on. But if you\u2019re thinking about selling the structure, you\u2019d have to do some serious work. Massive remodel. And I can\u2019t guarantee you\u2019d get your money\u2019s worth. See how it sits right in the middle of this land? The people who own the rest of this beach and land, they\u2019d be the ones to ask. Maybe they\u2019d buy your lot just to get you out of here so they can put up a hotel and strip mall. You should ask.\u201d He looked around, stretching his neck. \u201cNot exactly a prime location for that, though. This place is kind of out-of-the-way.\u201d</p><p>Cooper was silent a moment. \u201cYou got an estimate to gut it?\u201d</p><p>The man ripped off the top sheet and passed it to him\u2014$5,890.00. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t include plumbing, septic system or removal of damaged, rotting wood. That would be another several thousand. Then you\u2019re left with a frame, pretty much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoughly six thousand? Just to tear it apart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a real nice estimate. And that bar? As bars go, it\u2019s terrible. It\u2019s a good fifty years old. And it\u2019s not an antique. It\u2019s just old and cheap. And rotting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs anything on this place all right?\u201d Cooper asked.</p><p>The guy gave a nod. \u201cGood deck. It\u2019s newer than the structure. And as far as we can tell, the foundation is solid\u2014but I wouldn\u2019t guarantee it. You have a really bad roof. If you get it in your head to renovate, I\u2019d recommend a new roof. We don\u2019t do renovation, but I\u2019d bet you\u2019re looking at over a hundred grand there. But hey, do you know what people would pay for your view?\u201d</p><p>Cooper ran a hand around the back of his neck which, despite the cold, was sweating. \u201cIf I decide to just knock it down, can you do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d he said, shaking his head. \u201cBut I can recommend a good demolition team. I can also recommend plumbers, septic repair or replacement, interior work, roofers. These are the people we work with on a regular basis\u2014contractors of every stripe. We specialize in fire-and-flood damage\u2014after our work is done, the rebuilding starts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you ever go in and just clean up the mess?\u201d Cooper asked.</p><p>\u201cPretty often. But this one is bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust because the electricity was off for a few weeks and the bait died?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was in serious decline, filling up with mold, before that happened. You might want to check with your insurance company\u2014they might help. But this place has been neglected for a long time. Looks like someone tried to get that septic system up and running for a while, when it should\u2019ve been replaced.\u201d He lifted bushy eyebrows. \u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not me. I have to think about what I\u2019m going to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough,\u201d the man said, sticking out his hand.</p><p>\u201cIf I decide to do something with this, how much notice do you need?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s turning winter. The schedule isn\u2019t too bad. But if you don\u2019t act soon, we\u2019re going to be weathered out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try to think fast,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cGot any more of those face masks?\u201d</p><p>The man reached into his pocket and pulled out several. \u201cJust so you know\u2014they\u2019re not that effective against the smell in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust out of curiosity, why didn\u2019t you fix the place up before it got so bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t mine until recently. The man who owned it died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Well, hell, man! Cash it in! The land it\u2019s on is probably worth something.\u201d</p><p>He knew that, Cooper did. But something about the whole thing just gnawed at him. He wasn\u2019t going to be able to make a decision until he understood why Ben Bailey lived with mold and rotting wood. The fact that he was pretty unmotivated didn\u2019t explain it. Ben could\u2019ve made one phone call and traded some land for enough money to build himself something nice. \u201cSo,\u201d he said to the man with the cleanup crew, \u201chow much to make that fish tank and any rotting food go away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwenty-five hundred. But that won\u2019t solve your septic problems. We can deal with that, too, short of replacing it. But that won\u2019t leave you a sound building and the plumbing won\u2019t be serviceable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just want time to look around the inside. And think. And brother, I can\u2019t think when it smells like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwenty-five hundred makes it unpleasant rather than deadly.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cDone. How fast?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow. We\u2019ll bring in a crew, a Dumpster and some fans to air the place out.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s do it. I have to look around in there before I can figure out what to do next. Right now I\u2019m leaning toward a bulldozer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t say I blame you, Mr. Cooper.\u201d</p><p>Four</p><p>Rawley lived in a little inland town called Elmore. Mac gave Cooper directions to his place. Besides a gas station, post office, elementary school and Dairy Queen, Elmore wasn\u2019t much of a town. The larger town of Bandon wasn\u2019t far away and possibly served the small population\u2019s needs.</p><p>The house was a small, old, brick structure with a porch. That classic pickup was parked on the side, identifying the place as belonging to Rawley. The yard was well kept and the grass still green, though the trees and shrubs were showing signs of fall with either color or brown. When Cooper knocked on the door and Rawley answered, the last thing he expected was the homey, clean, orderly house he saw inside.</p> <p>\u201cHey. Got a minute?\u201d Cooper asked.</p><p>Rawley gave his version of a nod, which was a smirk and a tilt of his head, stepping back so Cooper could enter. Inside was a living room and dining room that looked like a woman had left it behind\u2014lace covers on the worn arms of chairs and sofa, pictures of farm scenes on the walls, a buffet with a couple of good glass bowls on top of a fabric runner, candlesticks on the table. All old, all maintained. In front of the fire sat an elderly man in a wheelchair. He was dressed in overalls and a long-sleeved shirt\u2014clean\u2014and on his feet were socks only. No point in shoes if you never walked.</p><p>\u201cVery nice, Rawley,\u201d Cooper said, taking it in. \u201cThat your dad?\u201d</p><p>Rawley nodded.</p><p>Cooper had never been a patient man, but this was really stretching what patience he had very thin. \u201cI wish you\u2019d talk,\u201d he said. \u201cUnless you\u2019re mute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk when I got something to say,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cWell, there,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cYou doing okay since Ben\u2019s death?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot hardly,\u201d Rawley said.</p><p>Well, there you go again, Cooper thought. Honest, if not informative. \u201cAnything you need that I can get for you, now that he\u2019s gone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t think what,\u201d Rawley said.</p><p>At that statement, the old man turned his chair around to face Cooper. He didn\u2019t exactly hold his head up, and Cooper could see that he was very likely a stroke victim. He turned the chair with his left arm, the right kinked in protectively at his side, and the right side of his face\u2014mouth and eye\u2014sagged.</p><p>\u201cYou looking for work?\u201d Cooper asked.</p><p>\u201cHadn\u2019t been. Why? You gonna open up Ben\u2019s place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I\u2019m cleaning it up and clearing it out. It\u2019s got troubles\u2014rot and mold and dead fish. Tomorrow a crew is coming out to clean out and remove the fish tanks, rotten food, trash...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPolice locked it up and wouldn\u2019t let me in,\u201d Rawley said by way of explanation.</p><p>\u201cI know. And the electric company turned off the power,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cThe result is a stink and mess. But once they get the place so I can breathe in there, I have to go through his things. You know\u2014pitch, give away, sell, whatever. There might be some things in there you want. If you help out, I can pay you what Ben paid you.\u201d</p><p>Rawley grinned and showed off a stunning set of dentures. \u201cHe paid me a ton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGimme a break, Ben didn\u2019t have shit. And he couldn\u2019t tolerate a lie, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEight dollars an hour,\u201d Rawley said. \u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn three days, I guess. Your dad okay alone if you work?\u201d</p><p>The old man inhaled sharply and briefly lifted his head. It looked like he scowled, but with the uneven features, it was hard to tell. His good eye narrowed.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s okay. If I work, the neighbor checks on him twice a day. I leave him fixed up for what he needs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, then. If you\u2019re interested.\u201d</p><p>Rawley gave a nod. No questions, no suggestions, no commentary.</p><p>\u201cRawley, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do with the place. Fair warning. This could be a week of work and that\u2019s all. I might just tear the place down and sell the land.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll figure it out,\u201d Rawley said, apparently unconcerned.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I guess.\u201d Cooper scratched his neck. \u201cSee you then.\u201d He turned to leave.</p><p>\u201cHold on,\u201d Rawley said. He went into the kitchen, which was just through the dining room arch, then came back with a package. Cookies, wrapped in Saran, no plate, no ziplock bag. \u201cCan\u2019t be much around that toy hauler for snacks. They\u2019re sugar-free, on account of Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Cooper said, accepting them. \u201cThanks. That\u2019s real nice.\u201d</p><p>Rawley just shrugged.</p><p>Cooper left with yet another mystery about Ben. Rawley lived in a house that was well cared for, yet Ben\u2019s place was mostly a wreck. How did that add up? Did Rawley take care of himself, but do a sad job for Ben?</p><p>Once in his truck, Cooper tried a cookie. Not bad, for sugar-free. Soft and tasty. He just shook his head.</p><p>Three days later, the smell wasn\u2019t too bad and Cooper could get inside Ben\u2019s place without choking. He had the electricity turned on; it not only offered functional lighting in the shop, but he ran an extension to the trailer to save on his generator. Just having a crew there to take out garbage and install fans brought attention to the place, and when the weather was decent, people who were out on the beach felt a need to wander closer, to find Cooper on the deck or the dock. Usually they would stop to say hello or hang out for a while, to ask what was going on. A kayaker rowed up to the dock, got out and asked what was going to happen to the place now.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t exactly know,\u201d he said honestly. \u201cI guess I\u2019m responsible for it, but I\u2019m not interested in running a business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither was Ben,\u201d the guy said, laughing. \u201cBut people around Thunder Point liked the place, even if we didn\u2019t want to go inside too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you like it for?\u201d Cooper asked.</p><p>\u201cGossip and drinks, mainly. And Ben used to pick up his deli food every couple of days from Carrie\u2014when he couldn\u2019t talk her into delivering. She\u2019d do that if her daughter was free to mind the deli. That\u2019s good stuff, Carrie\u2019s stuff, and Ben never even marked it up. He had egg sandwich kind of things for the morning, sandwiches and pizza for later, desserts and stuff. It was good. It was all wrapped\u2014he didn\u2019t cook it. Know what I mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll I saw in there was a microwave and a stove and oven that looked...\u201d He didn\u2019t want to say ancient, but although the kitchen was spotless, the appliances didn\u2019t look very reliable. The bar, though small, was neat and well stocked. The glasses, though dusty, looked as if they\u2019d been washed, not that he\u2019d trust them.</p><p>A man and woman with a dog saw him on the dock and said, \u201cYou\u2019re the new guy, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Charlie and this here\u2019s Donna, the wife. So, when you gonna open up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know that I will,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cFor now I\u2019m just cleaning the place up. I\u2019m not much of a cook...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBen didn\u2019t really cook. He warmed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid Ben live on egg sandwiches and deli stuff?\u201d Cooper asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Charlie said. \u201cHe was good with drinks. All drinks. Coffee, cappuccino, wine, beer and liquor. If the day was nice, I\u2019d end up here with a bunch of guys from town for a drink or two. Sport fishermen came here for a few before taking their boats over to the marina.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Cliffhanger\u2019s? Or Waylan\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCliffhanger\u2019s is expensive and Waylan\u2019s is a shit hole. But they have HD TV. The owner is trying to make it a sports bar. If you open up, get a TV.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGotcha,\u201d Cooper said.</p><p>Cooper and Rawley went through Ben\u2019s living quarters, which were, to his surprise, tidy. He suspected Rawley had taken care of that, too. Ben had been in possession of a minimal wardrobe. \u201cYou want the clothes?\u201d he asked Rawley.</p><p>\u201cToo big for me,\u201d he said. \u201cI could use some old shirts and sweats for Dad. The rest could go to the VA.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Cooper said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take \u2019em home and wash \u2019em up first. Then drop \u2019em off at the VA.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s above and beyond...\u201d Cooper said.</p><p>\u201cThey deserve that. At least.\u201d</p><p>Cooper was impressed. He was beginning to suspect that Rawley was a good and generous man, under his grump and grumble.</p><p>Ben had an old TV and stereo, a boom box\u2014apparently he hadn\u2019t graduated to the iPod yet\u2014and bookcase that held many books about Oregon wildlife, mostly birds. He found Ben\u2019s laptop, their primary means of communication the past ten years, and therein he found out a few things about Ben that he might\u2019ve known if he\u2019d been paying attention. Ben was an involved ornithologist. He might not hold any kind of degree, but the history on his computer showed almost daily visits to websites and blogs about birds, further explaining the preserve on his land.</p><p>Cooper had walked through the preserve all the way to the high cliff edge towering over the Pacific a few days earlier. The growth was thick but he\u2019d found what appeared to be a seldom-traveled path through the spruce, Douglas fir and shrubs. The bright colors of fall battled with the dark green of fir trees; among the ground cover he saw withered plants he was willing to bet sprang into bloom with the spring and summer warmth. He\u2019d spotted the remnants of many old nests, perhaps abandoned for the winter. There were some shells and some dead eggs, not to mention a few low-flying seabirds threatened by his presence. One lone eagle circled overhead for a little while. There was one tree in which perched a few birds that looked like small cranes.</p><p>Ben had saved a lot of online documents about bird preserves, about rare and endangered birds. There were pictures on his computer, pictures he\u2019d taken himself\u2014he was an avid bird-watcher. And there were large, high-powered binoculars hanging from nails all over the place.</p><p>He also found that Ben had saved many emails from Cooper and from Luke Riordan but very few from other people. It spurred a memory of an email Cooper had gotten from Ben, in which he casually said, \u201cSince my father passed a couple of years ago...\u201d Cooper had thought, a couple of years ago? He hadn\u2019t notified his friends of his father\u2019s death?</p><p>And then Cooper asked himself, who would he write about something like that? While Cooper liked a lot of people, he could count his good friends on one hand.</p><p>But Cooper had sisters, brothers-in-law, nieces and nephews who were always in touch. At least he was connected.</p><p>It was going to take him a long time to get through all of Ben\u2019s saved emails, but over time he\u2019d manage. There could be information in there about his intention for the property. There could even be some stray clue about what led to his death, if he had some issue with an enemy no one really knew about. He doubted it, but it was worth checking.</p><p>The weather was good that afternoon. Rawley had gone home with a lot of laundry to do and Cooper relaxed on the deck with the laptop. He counted nine kids on the beach\u2014two wearing wet suits with paddleboards and oars out on the still bay, four batting a volleyball around, though they didn\u2019t have a net set up, three girls parked on the sand, talking. There were three ATVs lined up behind them, although he hadn\u2019t seen them arrive.</p><p>Cooper was just enjoying his view and the kids seemed to be having good, clean fun. There was a little monkey business\u2014a guy grabbed a girl, stole a kiss, got punched, which made him laugh hysterically and then chase her, catch her, get a more receptive welcome the second time. The two guys with the boards went almost to the mouth of the bay, where the Pacific waves were high and challenging. Inside the bay was smooth as silk, dark as ink. Wet suits, very intelligent\u2014the air was cold and the ocean much colder. But they were obviously pros; they barely got their feet wet. In the summer, Cooper bet there was a lot of snorkeling, maybe diving, maybe running surfboards out beyond the bay. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>He shot a note off to his sister Rochelle and told her this was a pretty cool place, in fact. He had no idea what to do with it, though. Dry camping in the fifth wheel was not exactly convenient\u2014he had to find a trailer park, dump the lav and reload potable water every few days. But he could at least run off the bar\u2019s power and not his battery. He hadn\u2019t told anyone in his family the extent to which he was tied to all this\u2014he didn\u2019t want any advice. His family, especially his sisters, was very good at telling him what he should do.</p><p>He saw the dog again, but not with the girl this time. A young man or boy was with him, throwing a ball for the dog as he walked. Husband? he wondered.</p> <p>Then he saw the guy trying to give the kids on the beach a wide berth, walking all the way down to the surf to get by them without contact. The guys, six of them, two in wet suits, made a line across his path. The dog walker went the other way, headed inland for the hill, calling the dog to follow. The teenage boys reversed their position, blocking him again. The dog, half as big as a human, cowered behind his master.</p><p>Cooper, who had been in way too much trouble for fighting when he was younger, could see the fight brewing. He knew what was coming, and it was six on one. Then the guy who must be the ringleader shoved the loner. The loner stood taller; his shoulders widened a little, ready. The ringleader was seriously talking him down, leaning into him, verbally assaulting him. Then he shoved him again and the loner put his fists up.</p><p>\u201cNot gonna happen, assholes,\u201d Cooper said aloud to no one. He put down the laptop. Then he stood, put two fingers in his mouth and rent the air with a deafening whistle.</p><p>They all turned to see him standing on the deck of the now-defunct bait shop. His legs were braced apart, hands on his hips, and he watched. He hated bullies. He was ready to leap over the deck rail and barrel down to the beach to stand up for this guy, even though the guy, the loner, might be the problem. It didn\u2019t matter if the loner had done something terrible, you don\u2019t do that\u2014you don\u2019t attack someone in a fight that isn\u2019t fair and balanced.</p><p>The teens watched him; he watched the teens.</p> <p>Then the barricade wisely separated and the loner passed, headed for Cooper\u2019s dock.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t headed for Cooper. He went to the bottom of the steps that led up to the bar and sat. From there he threw the ball for the dog. Cooper let this go for about five minutes, then he descended to meet the guy. A very cranky-looking teenager looked up at him and said, \u201cThanks for that. I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou guess? Would you rather I just watch them beat you up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey probably wouldn\u2019t have.\u201d He looked back down to accept the Great Dane\u2019s ball and throw it again.</p><p>\u201cProbably wouldn\u2019t have?\u201d Cooper asked.</p><p>The kid shrugged.</p> <p>\u201cHave a little disagreement with your friends?\u201d</p><p>The kid looked up and laughed. \u201cDude, they are not my friends!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are they, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTeammates. And that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>Cooper took another two steps down and sat on a step even with the kid. \u201cYou throw the last game or something?\u201d</p><p>The kid gave him a very impatient look. He held on to the ball, all slimy with dog spit. The dog sat and panted happily, full of expectation. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t understand,\u201d the kid said, finally throwing the ball.</p><p>\u201cWanna try me?\u201d</p><p>The kid shot him an angry look. All defensive, hurt, full of impotent rage, and Cooper thought, Holy shit\u2014that\u2019s me! About twenty years ago or so...</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m the new kid,\u201d he said. \u201cJust moved here. Just in time for football, which was my fatal mistake. I wasn\u2019t supposed to get on the team, much less make touchdowns. The asshole on the beach, he\u2019s a senior. Team captain. He was counting on three things this year\u2014being all-conference, being homecoming king and getting laid by every cheerleader in Coos County.\u201d</p><p>Cooper had a strange reaction to that. First of all, being the new kid felt all too familiar to him. Getting in fights, though long ago, was fiercely memorable. Homecoming king\u2014not Cooper! And cheerleaders? When he was in high school, he hadn\u2019t been lucky enough to even date one, let alone anything more. He thought about Mac\u2019s daughter, whom he\u2019d met when he\u2019d had dinner with the McCains a few nights ago. Eve was a lovely, virginal, delightful sixteen-year-old cheerleader who no one should be allowed to touch. Just to be ornery, he asked, \u201cHow many of those things are you going to rack up?\u201d</p><p>The kid looked at him incredulously. \u201cSeriously? Like I could ever get all-conference or get a date. Come on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe kid who shoved you\u2014who is he?\u201d</p><p>A bitter laugh. \u201cJag Morrison. Crown prince of Thunder Point. And yes, that\u2019s short for Jaguar, if you can believe anyone would name their kid that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShew,\u201d Cooper said, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Cooper let that settle a little bit. Obviously there was some very bad blood there. It could be about anything\u2014about this kid being a better ball player, about a girl, about anything. Finally Cooper asked, \u201cYour dog have a name, kid?\u201d</p><p>He laughed without humor. \u201cAre you ready for it? Hamlet. It\u2019s Danish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could use a tougher dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about it,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cHow about you? Name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about you?\u201d he shot back.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he said, putting out his hand. \u201cHank Cooper. People just call me Cooper.\u201d</p><p>The kid relaxed a little. \u201cLandon Dupre.\u201d He shot a glance at the teenagers on the beach, who were not going anywhere. It occurred to Cooper that they were looking for a second chance at bullying and intimidating Landon.</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you, Landon. So, what do your parents have to say about this new-kid issue you\u2019ve got going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have parents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. So who do you report to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReport to?\u201d he mimicked with a mean laugh. \u201cGimme a break.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019m trying to figure out, in the nicest possible way, if your parents back you up, if you\u2019re a street urchin, in foster care or just plain contrary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI live with my sister,\u201d he said. His voice dropped, as did his chin. It was either a measure of respect or misery.</p><p>\u201cAh, the girl in the red slicker.\u201d</p><p>Landon looked up at him. \u201cYou know her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know the dog\u2014she\u2019s had him out on the beach a couple of times. He\u2019s hard to miss, big as a horse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd dumb as a stump.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, you shouldn\u2019t put him down like that,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cYou might damage his self-esteem.\u201d Then grinned at the kid. \u201cWhy\u2019d you get him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy sister got him for me. He was a rescue\u2014his owner had to deploy. It was her idea of some kind of consolation prize because she moved me right before my best season ever.\u201d</p><p>The dog was back, dropping the ball, sitting expectantly, saliva running out of his jowls. \u201cHamlet, here, he has a drooling issue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s horrible. I don\u2019t know what was wrong with a good old German shepherd.\u201d</p><p>Cooper laughed in spite of himself, happy he was not this kid\u2019s guardian. \u201cWhy\u2019d you move here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDivorce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re divorced?\u201d Cooper asked facetiously.</p><p>Landon\u2019s head snapped around at Cooper and, seeing his smile, melted a little bit. \u201cShe got divorced, couldn\u2019t afford so much house, wanted a smaller town so she could keep track of me better\u2014which I so appreciate, if you can understand. And she didn\u2019t enjoy running into the ex. Now I get that, but really, do we have to move to Podunk, Oregon, where the natives just want to kick the shit out of me every day? Seriously?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you told her?\u201d Cooper asked. He almost looked over his shoulder to see who was talking. This was the weirdest interaction he\u2019d ever had. He sounded like his father.</p><p>The kid\u2019s chin dropped again. \u201cI\u2019m not hiding behind my sister, dude. Besides, she\u2019s got her own troubles.\u201d</p><p>Cooper, who had big sisters, absolutely got that. But all he said was, \u201cIs this \u2018dude\u2019 thing almost over? Calling everyone dude? I never caught on to that....\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, dude, you might wanna catch up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr you might,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, anyone back you up? I mean, anyone? Teachers? Ministers? Corrections officers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny. You\u2019re a real comedian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am, huh. But I\u2019m serious, everyone needs a wingman. I got in fights when I was your age. I don\u2019t know what it was about me....\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant a second opinion?\u201d he said.</p><p>Cooper laughed at his sarcasm. \u201cOkay, never mind. I think I\u2019m catching on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBen,\u201d Landon said. \u201cBen was my friend.\u201d</p><p>Stunned, Cooper was silent. Then he put a hand on Landon\u2019s shoulder. \u201cHe was my friend, too. I\u2019m sorry, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Well. Whatever happened? It shouldn\u2019t have.\u201d</p><p>He gathered strays, Cooper thought. He gave Rawley work, protected Landon and made sure Gina\u2019s Jeep was running. Who knew how many others he helped? He protected the birds and fish. He had a lot of friends and no real friends. He took care of the town in his way, keeping this little piece of beach safe.</p><p>Five</p><p>The weather turned stormy not long after Landon finally made his escape across the beach to the town. The bait shop could get pretty lonely during a storm. Cooper guessed that with the wet Oregon weather, there were plenty of nights like this. So he showered in the trailer, then took the truck the short way into town, across the beach, and decided it was time to hit Cliffhanger\u2019s for a meal.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t crowded, which came as no surprise. He had watched the fishing boats come in before the rain clouds and the last of the sunlight left the bay, and he supposed those guys were happy to be home, eating a hot meal in front of a warm fire. There was a large hearth in the restaurant that could be seen in the bar and it made him think of Jack\u2019s place in Virgin River. A lot could be done to that old bait shop of Ben\u2019s to make it a cozier hangout\u2014like a fireplace, for starters, he thought. Then he told himself to stop it\u2014no matter what some piece of paper said, he really had no stake in it. He was only going through the motions for Ben\u2019s sake. For some reason, his old friend trusted him.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t expected to see a familiar face in the restaurant, so he was pleasantly surprised when he realized Mac was sitting at the bar, nursing a beer and talking to the bartender. He wasn\u2019t dressed for duty tonight. Cooper approached and said, \u201cHey, Deputy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCooper,\u201d he said, putting out his hand. \u201cWhat brings you out on such a wet night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFood,\u201d he said, sitting up at the bar.</p><p>\u201cCliff, bring my friend Cooper a beer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCliff?\u201d Cooper repeated with a short laugh. \u201cThat\u2019s convenient.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, right,\u201d the guy said. \u201cWhat\u2019s your pleasure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDraft,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cThis must be your place, Cliff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMust be. Menu?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust get the grouper,\u201d Mac said.</p><p>Cooper peered at him. \u201cAnd how do I want that done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll have the grouper. Just trust me. So, what\u2019s happening on the other side of the beach?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot most of the smell out, went through most of Ben\u2019s things, donated, threw away stuff, you know. It\u2019s not functional. Ben was working on that septic system way back when I was waiting for him to meet me in California. I guess he never quite got it fixed,\u201d Cooper said.</p><p>\u201cSo, what next?\u201d</p><p>Cooper drank some beer. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m thinking. I pulled down part of a wall\u2014I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s mold or rot. Maybe it needs to be leveled. I don\u2019t know.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still here,\u201d Mac observed.</p><p>He took another swallow of beer and shook his head. \u201cFeels like unfinished business around here.

He bought deli food from the deli, but he didn\u2019t mark it up....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think Carrie gave him a break,\u201d Mac said. \u201cHe bought all his supplies, including liquor, from big-box stores and I bet he made a decent profit on that. I mean, there was no rent, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe took care of things. Of people. I have Rawley working again, for now.\u201d</p><p>Mac grew serious for a moment, then put a firm hand on his back, as if to say thanks.</p> <p>\u201cI ran into a kid on the beach today who was Ben\u2019s friend, so he says,\u201d Cooper went on. \u201cBen\u2019s created a habitat for those birds on the point. I feel like I should find out what Rawley needs before I leave. Like I owe it to Ben. I wonder, though...he took care of people but everything is broken down to the point of falling apart. How\u2019d he live?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think making money was ever a priority of Ben\u2019s, but don\u2019t quote me. You probably know more about his business than I do. Than any of us do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he didn\u2019t have much money, for one thing. And didn\u2019t worry about it, from what I can figure out. Why didn\u2019t he give that place to someone else? Why didn\u2019t he give it to the town?\u201d</p><p>Mac laughed. He took a pull on his beer. \u201cThe town would\u2019ve sold it. Like I said, there are people in town who like things the way they are\u2014simple. Then there are people who think a big business on the bay would be good for the town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Cooper asked.</p><p>He gave a lame shrug. \u201cI think a big business, like a golf resort or something, would turn us into a town full of busboys, waiters, maids and valets. I think it would put Carrie\u2019s deli, the Pizza Hut and the diner out of business. But it could help the chamber of commerce and commercial fishermen, especially if we ended up with a five-star restaurant at that resort. You want to know what I\u2019m talking about? Drive up to Bandon Dunes. People come from all over the world to stay there, play golf there, hold events from business conferences to weddings there. It\u2019s really something. Very high-class. There\u2019s a lot good about it. And the help comes from Bandon.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s work....\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd not to be taken lightly,\u201d Mac admitted.</p><p>\u201cIt could help the local economy,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cIncrease the value of your property.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt could,\u201d Mac said. \u201cYou\u2019ve been here about a week. Have you told anyone about Ben\u2019s will?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might\u2019ve mentioned I was responsible for the bait shop, but you\u2019re the only one with the details. You and Rawley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Rawley doesn\u2019t talk. People are already assuming things that are probably true\u2014like that you own it. And you could sell it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s still a little legal wrangling to be done,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cI don\u2019t have to hang around for that, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you still here?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAs near as I can explain, I want to understand Ben\u2019s intentions, if I can. That doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m planning to meet his expectations\u2014maybe I just can\u2019t. But I owe it to the guy to see if I can figure them out before I make a plan.\u201d</p><p>Mac glanced over his shoulder, glanced back and said, \u201cWell, get ready to make a plan, Cooper. Incoming...\u201d</p><p>Almost before he finished his sentence, a woman appeared. She was at least fifty-five, but trying to look thirty-five. Her suit was some kind of satiny red material, low cut to reveal her cleavage. The miniskirt exposed legs that were short, and her pumps were high, very high. Hair bleached blond, of course. Nails, long and red. She wasn\u2019t dressed for church; in fact, she\u2019d look pretty at home with a pole to swing around.</p><p>\u201cWell, Mac, how are you?\u201d she said, leaning toward the deputy for a cheek press and kiss-kiss. \u201cAnd who is your friend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRay Anne, meet Cooper. Cooper, this is Ray Anne. Cooper was a friend of Ben\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Her face crumpled on cue. \u201cOh, Cooper, I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. Ben will be greatly missed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. Pleased to meet you,\u201d he said. But he knew beyond a doubt that Ben didn\u2019t have a relationship with this woman. In contrast, he had understood Ben\u2019s relationship with Rawley almost immediately.</p><p>There were a few minutes of chat, Ray Anne asking after Lou and the kids, wondering if any progress had been made on that traffic light in town. Did Mac hear anything about a \u201cdomestic situation\u201d involving Charlie and Donna? To which Mac replied, \u201cNo, was there a situation?\u201d</p><p>Without answering, she turned to Cooper. \u201cI heard a friend of Ben\u2019s was in town. How is everything out at his place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA wreck,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cI\u2019m exploring ways to deal with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if you need any help, feel free to call.\u201d</p><p>A business card appeared; she was a Realtor. Apparently, the woman knew sleight of hand. That card must have been in her hand the whole time, yet had remained invisible until her strike. Cooper looked at it briefly, looked back at Ray Anne, smiled and said, \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know every good contractor in the area, no matter what you need\u2014paint, flooring, structure damage, anything...\u201d</p><p>She knew everything. \u201cMold removal?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d she said, beaming. She tapped the hand that held the card. \u201cJust give me a call. That\u2019s my cell. Anytime!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAppreciated,\u201d he said. The grouper arrived.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s your dinner,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be seeing you around town. Take care. And let me know if there\u2019s anything you need, Hank. Always more than happy to help a friend.\u201d</p><p>Mac and Cooper turned to their identical dinners. Cooper took a bite. \u201cThis is good,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cTold ya,\u201d Mac returned.</p><p>\u201cSo, she knows everything. She probably knows my social security number. You introduced me as Cooper, but she called me Hank. I\u2019d bet she knows the acreage on Ben\u2019s place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be my guess,\u201d Mac said.</p><p>Cooper ate a little more grouper. \u201cAnd I bet I could get laid for a couple hundred acres.\u201d</p><p>Mac turned toward him and, with the slightest smile, said, \u201cYou can get laid for just talking about it.\u201d</p><p>Cooper tried not to laugh, as Ray Anne was still working the room, taking a run on the bar, then stopping off at tables. \u201cThis common with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so,\u201d Mac said, eating more of his dinner. \u201cYou\u2019re the first newcomer we\u2019ve had around here in a while, however.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ever, um, experienced that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe attention? Or the payoff?\u201d Mac asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, since we\u2019re sharing confidences...\u201d</p><p>\u201cCooper, I work in this town. My kids go to school here, my aunt\u2019s a teacher here. Lou\u2019s known Ray Anne a long time. In a word, no. I have truly dense areas in my brain, but not that dense. Really, she\u2019s not my style. I never did have a mother fixation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never had a mother who looked like that,\u201d Cooper said.</p><p>They ate in silence and by the time Cooper pushed away his plate, Ray Anne had left the restaurant. \u201cSo, Mac, did the family desert you tonight?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Mac sat back. \u201cNot exactly. It\u2019s Lou\u2019s bunco night with some good friends from Coquille and she\u2019ll be out late. I picked up a pizza for the kids and ran for my life.\u201d He wiped his mouth with his napkin. \u201cI stood at the door, threw it in and said I\u2019d be home in two hours. They jumped on it like starving hounds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo whole hours?\u201d Cooper asked with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cI have to check homework. If I don\u2019t check homework, Lou\u2019s on me like a cheap suit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChecking homework. That can\u2019t be so bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou checked homework lately, pal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhose homework do you think I\u2019d check?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s not the point, Cooper. The point is, it\u2019s torture. If I were in school now, I wouldn\u2019t have graduated sixth grade. In short, I\u2019d rather give up a nut. But that\u2019s the price of fatherhood.\u201d</p><p>Lou stood in front of the bathroom mirror in only her panties, gently lifting her breasts. Then she took a side view and sighed. Although they were small, she felt they drooped to an unflattering degree; they used to be perky. She let them go. Then with her fingers gently pulling at her cheeks, back toward her ears, she wondered for the millionth time if she could look ten years younger with a face-lift.</p><p>\u201cLou, come back,\u201d Joe called from the bedroom.</p><p>I\u2019m not greedy, she thought. Just ten years.</p><p>She sighed again and went back to the bedroom. Joe Metcalf was fifty and, besides being handsome, he was in terrific shape. George Clooney shape. He was strong as an ox, wide-shouldered, flat-bellied, with long legs, big wonderful hands and beautiful teeth. As she approached the bed, he turned off the TV and opened his arms. \u201cWhat were you doing in there?\u201d he asked, his lips going immediately to her neck.</p><p>\u201cWe call it freshening up,\u201d she said, tilting her head back to give him more of her neck.</p><p>\u201cI bet you were brooding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow why would you say that?\u201d she asked, pulling back.</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s something you tend to do. I think all our problems would be solved if you brought me out of the closet. Why are you keeping me a secret, Lou? Why am I still \u2018bunco night\u2019?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated. It was so complicated. Mostly it was his age\u2014ten years younger. Even though his hair would be gray if he grew it out, with that shaved head, he could pass for forty-five. \u201cI don\u2019t want the kids to feel vulnerable, to feel like my attention could be sliding away from them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t, Lou. We\u2019ll spend whatever time together is reasonable for you. I have kids, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYours are on their own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God,\u201d he said with a sigh. He rolled onto his back but he kept an arm around her. Joe was the divorced father of a son and daughter, twenty-five and twenty-three, respectively. \u201cThey still have way too many needs, however. A wallet drain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll be married with children before you know it,\u201d Lou said. \u201cAnd so will mine. And I\u2019ll feel like a great-grandmother. Oh, my God.\u201d She dropped her head onto his naked shoulder.</p><p>He laughed at her and his hand found her ass. \u201cBest-looking great-grandmother in the state, maybe the country.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her head, messy red-gold curls flopping around. \u201cWhen you\u2019re seventy I\u2019ll be eighty. Eighty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist, like you\u2019re screwing a nineteen-year-old. I hope I live to seventy. I can\u2019t wait to see what you bring to eighty!\u201d</p><p>Lou and Joe had met through an online dating service. They made a date for coffee and he looked, well, mature. When she asked, \u201cHow old are you?\u201d, he answered, \u201cHow old do you want me to be?\u201d She had answered, \u201cFifty-nine,\u201d and he said, \u201cConsider it done.\u201d</p><p>It was weeks before she learned the truth. She thought he just looked damn good for his age, which men had an annoying tendency to do. It had been programmed that way by the world\u2014men became distinguished while women faded and aged.</p><p>He\u2019d been divorced for ten years, had tried dating from time to time but nothing really clicked and he wanted to meet someone he had things in common with who would join him for movies, dinner, social things. Oh, he liked to eat, went to movies seldom, but... \u201cOkay, the truth? I wanted to have sex again before I died. With someone I liked.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>What a coincidence. So did she.</p><p>He was a retired air force colonel who now worked for the Oregon State Police as a trooper. It was his mission to retire, for the second time, at sixty. And now that he\u2019d recovered from his divorce\u2014his ex was remarried and his kids had completed college\u2014he could count on a comfortable old age. Part of his job in Coos County was to assist the Sheriff\u2019s Department. That was a little close for comfort for Lou.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t see why,\u201d he argued. \u201cPolice people are like a family. They intermarry all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarry!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we have to be going somewhere!\u201d he said. \u201cBesides, Mac and I get along fine. He likes me. We work well together when we have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me think, let me think!\u201d she had pleaded. She\u2019d been pleading that for a year.</p><p>But Lou\u2019s little secret was that this was all she\u2019d ever wanted. If she\u2019d met him when she was twenty-one, she\u2019d have married him in a heartbeat\u2014provided he hadn\u2019t been eleven. She\u2019d have been a good wife to him. In fact, what she\u2019d always wanted was a home, a spouse, kids. Crazy as it seemed now, she\u2019d never even come close. She had been twenty-five when her brother and sister-in-law had Mac, thirty-five when their deaths left him orphaned and she became his parent. She\u2019d been only forty-four when Mac came to her and confessed his girlfriend was pregnant, and fifty when Cee Jay left him and the three kids. While raising Mac\u2019s kids was hard work\u2014cutting into her social life and sleep, costing time and money\u2014if she could, she would kiss Cee Jay for giving her these precious children.</p> <p>Once or twice a week, she met Joe. Sometimes they went out for dinner, sometimes they stayed in, sometimes they even went somewhere other than his house for the night. She stole a long weekend from her family to go to Victoria with him\u2014that was fabulous. He brought out her best self and she adored him. She just didn\u2019t want to saddle him with an old woman, which she felt she would be before long. And she didn\u2019t want anyone to laugh at the idea that she thought she was young enough for this, for him. Not the way they laughed at Ray Anne. Even Lou found Ray Anne ridiculous.</p><p>He slid down her panties. \u201cIt\u2019s up to you, babe\u2014I don\u2019t want to push you too much and I\u2019m not giving you up. But I sure like the way you play bunco.\u201d</p><p>There were two situations that always tempted Cooper to cut and run. Being at complete odds with his environment, as with the Army or certain jobs. Or feeling a little too comfortable and secure. That had happened to him a few times, a couple of which were very difficult. There were a couple of times he\u2019d been with a woman with whom he thought he could go the distance. He\u2019d had visions of the kind of happy home his parents had. When it didn\u2019t work out, he was dealt a double blow\u2014he was not only informed he\u2019d let the women down, a painful enough thing for a man who\u2019d been doing his best, but he had suffered the pain of loss and isolation. Naturally he tried to avoid both\u2014work unsuited to him and women he couldn\u2019t hold on to. For the past several years, he\u2019d avoided romantic relationships that could gut him in the end. That whole not-sleeping, feeling the deep ache that came from failure, enduring the sudden loneliness of being rejected...it was bad for his disposition. He only got involved with women he didn\u2019t care about too much. He just didn\u2019t like the risks he associated with settling down.</p><p>Cooper thought it might be in his best interest to put up a for-sale sign on this beach property and take off. It might be the safest thing to do. But the train wreck of a bar/bait shop tugged at him. He wasn\u2019t sure what that was about. He had no real stake in it. It was a gift, a piece of luck.</p><p>It was nice to be back on the water, even though the bait shop was a pimple on the otherwise beautiful landscape. It was a disaster; fixing it looked about as easy as scaling Everest. He didn\u2019t know where to start\u2014or whether to start.</p><p>Cooper couldn\u2019t remember ever having such difficulty making a decision. He generally made his decisions too fast, without really thinking things through. Enlisting in the Army, taking a job or quitting a job. Then there had been two engagements, five years apart, that were probably doomed from the start even if he hadn\u2019t seen it. He surprised himself this time. The Cooper he thought he was would have either sold or leveled that dying old shack by now.</p> <p>He felt an odd sense of peace. And it scared him to death.</p><p>A couple days later, Cooper found himself watching a quiet sunset with an empty beach. The fishing boats had docked. Cooper headed for town, the long way. He thought he\u2019d like either a burger at the diner or pizza. But as he approached the high school, he saw the football field was all lit up, the parking lot overflowing. He could hear cheers and the thumping of high school band music even with the windows up. He turned in to the school, drove around to the back and then hunted for a space but ended up on the back overflow dirt lot. There were buses representing the Carver High Badgers and as he walked toward the field, he could see that both the home and visiting bleachers were full.</p><p>By God, the whole town was there.</p><p>He paid his five bucks, but the bleachers were so crammed, he just hung around the end, standing. There was an announcer on the loudspeaker. He saw Eve on the sidelines and wondered which of the cheerleaders belonged to Gina. He watched a few plays. The score was 10\u20137 in favor of the Badgers nearing the half. He picked up from people that Thunder Point never beat Carver High, at least not in too many years to remember. And then, with the clock ticking down to the half, there was a fumble, a recovery and\u2014 \u201cDupre has the ball and runs it! Going, going, and we...have...touchdown! Sixty yards and touchdown for the Cougars!\u201d</p><p>The team, the cheerleaders and the fans were all roaring. A few of the Cougars rushed the quarterback and high-fived, hugged and slapped him on the back. The score went to 10\u201313, Cougars. They kicked and got the point just before the half, when both teams jogged off the field and were replaced by the band.</p><p>There was a rush on the concession stand and even though by now Cooper was starving, he saw the line was long and dense. He\u2019d be better off taking his chances on Cliff\u2019s or the Pizza Hut.</p><p>\u201cKid\u2019s a natural athlete,\u201d said a passerby on his way to the concession stand.</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t seen anything like him since I\u2019ve lived here,\u201d said another.</p> <p>Maybe things weren\u2019t as terrible for the kid as he believed\u2014the team and the crowd seemed to approve of his game. Despite the growls of hunger Cooper was suffering, he wasn\u2019t going anywhere.</p><p>After standing there for about ten minutes, with a steady stream of people moving in and out of the bleachers, someone said his name.</p><p>\u201cCooper? Cooper, what are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>He turned to see Gina, blond hair down tonight, wearing a Cougars sweatshirt under her jacket. \u201cI was on my way into town and saw the game, so I just stopped off here. So, which one is yours?\u201d he asked, tipping his head toward the cheerleaders.</p><p>\u201cThe redhead on the end\u2014that\u2019s Ashley. Right next to her is Mac\u2019s daughter, Eve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI spotted Eve. I had dinner at Mac\u2019s one night and met the kids,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou want to sit with us? We\u2019re right up there,\u201d she said, pointing. \u201cWe can cram you in. We try to get here early and hold seats on the fifty yard line.\u201d</p><p>When he turned to look, Mac was standing, waving his arms. For the first time he thought, maybe there\u2019s something going on there. Mac and Gina. It would make perfect sense. A couple of single parents, a lot in common...</p><p>He liked Gina\u2014she was pretty and sassy. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d he asked. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen so many people at a high school game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe town gets into the local sports,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve noticed, there isn\u2019t a big entertainment industry here. We\u2019re the real Friday Night Lights.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, I\u2019ll come up. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on my way to the bathroom. See you for the second half.\u201d</p><p>Cooper went to the bleachers to sit with Mac and Lou. Mac pulled a cola out of a small cooler and offered it. The kids were off running around the bleachers, looking for anyone to sit with but their family.</p><p>The dancers joined the marching band on the field, about a dozen of them. Cooper told them what Gina had said about the town being the real Friday Night Lights.</p><p>\u201cHave you counted the kids on the field tonight? Between football players, cheerleaders, pom-pom girls and band, you have any idea the number of hours the parents of this town have invested in just this activity?\u201d Lou asked him. \u201cPlus the fact, after all this, we can\u2019t afford anything else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re pretty good for a town this size,\u201d Cooper added.</p><p>\u201cThey are,\u201d Mac said. \u201cWe work \u2019em hard to keep \u2019em out of trouble.\u201d</p><p>The second half was an even better ball game, but not easier for the Cougars. The Badgers caught up and passed them, the Cougars got behind by 10, then they got within reach and the people from Thunder Point were going crazy. There were a couple of fights on the field, a couple of really bad tackles and penalties. A Cougar was taken out of the game and it got down to the wire.</p><p>And then he did it again\u2014Dupre recovered the ball and ran ninety yards for a touchdown, putting them two points ahead. The clock ran down and in a fever of excitement, the Cougars pulled off a win.</p><p>Even Cooper was on his feet, yelling till he was hoarse. He found himself hugged by Gina and Lou, slapped on the back by Mac.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the first time they\u2019ve been able to beat the Badgers since we moved here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarver High,\u201d he said. \u201cBig old farm boys from inland. They breed \u2019em hard and tough. It\u2019s been said they come out of the womb in shoulder pads.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t believe that,\u201d Cooper said with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cThe important thing is, they believe it,\u201d Mac said. \u201cI have to gather up kids. See you around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, probably. I won\u2019t head out without giving you a call, how\u2019s that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood enough. I can at least give you directions out of here.\u201d</p><p>Cooper let the majority of the crowd disperse; the line of cars and buses leaving the parking lot was moving real slow and he was parked at the back of the overflow lot. He had a bad feeling he was going to be left to forage for food back in his trailer. The crowd was likely headed for the few eateries in town. The kids might be headed for the beach, but that didn\u2019t worry him. After a game like that, he was happy for them to have a place to celebrate.</p><p>There was a lot of horn honking, yelling, cheering and general enthusiastic mania going on. Cooper stood right where he\u2019d been sitting, watching it all for fifteen or twenty minutes. He was at the fifty yard line, about ten rows up. The Badgers were headed for their buses; the lights in the stadium were cracking off one by one, leaving him in the shadows. He was surprised to find that attending a high school football game in a little town, not even his town, was the most fun he\u2019d had in a while. He\u2019d been sweating under his sweater and jacket, that\u2019s how much the tension of the game got to him. Other than joining his family at nieces\u2019 and nephews\u2019 events on rare occasions, this was a first for him. At least since his own high school experience, which had been a little like Landon\u2019s. Except he hadn\u2019t been a quarterback.</p><p>He sat down for a minute, elbows on knees, looking out at the dark field. He thought for a moment what it must be like to be Mac\u2014the law of the town, at the heart of the town, surrounded by all this excitement and connection, friends, family and something pulling at him every second. For a second he was envious, even though Cooper could go skiing in the Alps next week if he felt like it and Mac definitely could not. Mac was probably saving for college. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>Cooper was happy to see that things might not be as bad for Landon Dupre as he thought. The kid played a good game and there was no question he had the town\u2019s support. They thought they had themselves a football hero.</p><p>There weren\u2019t many people left. The concession stand was closed up. There were a few groups standing around in the parking lot, probably making after-game plans. The field was dark, the bleachers deserted, the Badger buses gone. Cooper felt a little silly. Before he could think about why he was sitting there getting all nostalgic, he told himself that by now the lines for a pizza or a Big Mac wouldn\u2019t be so long. He headed toward the parking lot.</p> <p>He was out of the stadium before he heard voices. He couldn\u2019t hear the words but he could tell by the tone that these voices weren\u2019t celebrating or having fun. There was some kind of trouble\u2014an argument of some kind. He told himself to keep going. It could be a drug deal gone bad; it could be a parent/teenager situation. But he stopped walking and listened. A hard, demanding, abusive voice; an answer that he understood\u2014no! Just one word. No. That was all it took and he walked toward the voice.</p><p>They were under the visiting team bleachers. In the dark he couldn\u2019t be sure of the number, but he thought it was four or five. Boys. Big boys. At least equal to him in size. He walked softly, wishing he had a gun, then relieved he didn\u2019t\u2014that\u2019s how people get killed, misinterpreting some situation in the dark of night.</p><p>\u201cI told you exactly what to do!\u201d a guy said.</p><p>\u201cAnd I told you that wasn\u2019t going to happen! I don\u2019t trip! I don\u2019t fumble.\u201d</p><p>Landon!</p> <p>Cooper walked a little faster. Ten long strides under the bleachers brought them into clear view. Two guys holding Landon\u2019s arms, two guys facing him, one doing the talking. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to push this. I\u2019m the team captain! You do what I tell you to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLose the game,\u201d Landon said. \u201cYou don\u2019t see that as wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t have lost! I had to get in that game, asshole, and with you showing off all the time\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, boys,\u201d Cooper said. He leaned against a strut, crossing his arms over his chest. \u201cJust congratulating Dupre on his game?\u201d</p><p>The boys holding his arms immediately let go. That\u2019s when Cooper noticed a trickle of blood running down the corner of Landon\u2019s mouth. He didn\u2019t get that in the game. It was fresh.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d their ringleader, who Cooper now knew to be Jag, demanded. \u201cYou some kind of pervert, hanging around the high school after dark, under the bleachers?\u201d</p> <p>Cooper laughed. He rubbed a hand over his head, giving a lazy scratch. \u201cOkay, let me see if I have this right. You\u2019re about to kick the shit out of your quarterback for winning a game instead of fumbling, tripping and throwing it so you could get in the game in his place, and you wonder if I\u2019m a pervert? Son, I\u2019m going to save you a lot of trouble. Dupre, let\u2019s go. I\u2019m hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is this dickhead?\u201d the kid asked.</p><p>Cooper had to be a little impressed. He did ask it with a great deal of authority.</p><p>One of the boys who\u2019d been holding Landon leaned toward Jag and said, \u201cHe owns the beach now.\u201d</p><p>Jag was shocked for a minute, but then he laughed. \u201cWell then, excuse me, your eminence. You actually own that shit hole on the beach. Well, hell, I guess you must be pretty important.\u201d</p><p>Cooper frowned. \u201cDupre,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have business,\u201d Jag said.</p><p>\u201cNot anymore. You\u2019re all done here.\u201d</p> <p>Jag stepped forward and got right up in Cooper\u2019s grill. He jabbed a finger into Cooper\u2019s chest and said, \u201cWe\u2019re talking to Dupre. And you. Are. Excused,\u201d he said, giving a singular jab with each of his last three words.</p><p>Cooper looked down at the finger, then up at Jag\u2019s face. Then he leisurely grabbed that offensive finger in one hand and bent it back until the kid yelped and went down on one knee. Jag tried to wiggle out, but it was useless. With the other hand Cooper grabbed a handful of the kneeling kid\u2019s hair. He looked over his head at Jag\u2019s posse. \u201cYou\u2019re going to want to get him out of here,\u201d he said. \u201cYou really don\u2019t want to get into it with me. I hate bullies. Hate fighting. But if I have to fight, I know every dirty trick.\u201d</p><p>He released Jag with enough of a shove that he fell backward. Then he met Landon\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d he said again, in a controlled voice. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>Six</p><p>Cooper and Landon walked briskly to the parking lot. There was no question Landon was jittery. \u201cStop looking over your shoulder,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cI\u2019ll hear them if they\u2019re coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if you don\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will. Where\u2019s your car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBehind the school, in the student lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I suppose they have cars there, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s my truck,\u201d he said, pointing. \u201cI\u2019m going to drive you to your car, then I\u2019ll follow you out of here. I\u2019ll follow you home, if you want me to, but I\u2019d rather go somewhere we can get food. I\u2019m not kidding, I\u2019m starving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if I don\u2019t feel like doing that?\u201d Landon asked.</p><p>Cooper didn\u2019t say anything. He waited until they got to the truck and said, \u201cGet in.\u201d Once they were both in the cab, Cooper turned toward Landon. \u201cHere\u2019s the deal. I know what happened tonight. I get it. The kid\u2019s an ass, a bully without a conscience, and he seems to have a posse. I\u2019ve been there, believe me. We\u2019re gonna have a talk about your options\u2014either over food or in your living room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy sister is there!\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t need her all into this. She will seriously make it worse. Even worse than you have!\u201d</p><p>He lifted eyebrows. \u201cDid she go to the game?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was there. But she takes her own car in case I have someplace to go. I never do, but in case.\u201d</p><p>Cooper started the truck. \u201cCall her. Tell her you\u2019re going out for a burger and you won\u2019t be late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t we do this some other time?\u201d he said. \u201cLike when the whole town isn\u2019t packed into the joints? Just let me out at my truck and I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall her. Drive to Cliffhanger\u2019s and I\u2019ll follow you. I doubt the whole booster club will be hanging out there. And we both know where most of the team will be. On the beach.\u201d</p><p>Landon sighed, giving in. \u201cTurn left into the parking lot. That\u2019s my truck, the green Mazda. I\u2019ll call my sister from the truck....\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake it a quick call, will you? I\u2019m sure those boys are pissed off and trying to decide what to do to you next.\u201d</p><p>He started to get out of the truck, then looked back at Cooper. \u201cWhat if you are some kind of pervert?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just saved your life. Now I\u2019m going to feed you and give you a few pointers. Don\u2019t make me regret it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what perverts do,\u201d Landon said.</p><p>Cooper leaned toward him. \u201cPerverts don\u2019t let you drive yourself. You\u2019re making me tired. After we talk about assholes like Jag, we\u2019ll talk about perverts. Now go!\u201d</p><p>Mac drove his aunt Lou and the younger kids home after the game. Once he got them all inside, he said, \u201cI\u2019m going to take a run through town, make sure all is quiet....\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t be quiet after a win like that,\u201d Lou said as she reached into the refrigerator for a diet cola. \u201cDon\u2019t go sitting out on the hill, spying on the beach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t do that,\u201d he said to her back.</p><p>\u201cYes, you do,\u201d she said, leaving the kitchen.</p><p>He stood there in indecision for a moment. Then he reached into the refrigerator, grabbed two beers and left the house. The night was clear and cold and there were a million stars. He only drove about ten blocks, to a neighborhood perched on the hill right above the main street. He parked and walked up the steps to the porch and knocked, hanging on to the beers in one hand.</p><p>Gina answered in her plaid winter jammies and heavy socks. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>He gave a shrug. \u201cI\u2019m in search of adult company and I\u2019ve had enough of Lou. I\u2019m sick of her bossing me around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did she say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe said, \u2018Don\u2019t go sit on the hill and spy on the beach.\u2019\u201d He held a beer toward her. \u201cCome on out.\u201d</p><p>She grabbed her jacket off the hook inside the door and slipped into it, turned off the porch light and then accepted the beer. \u201cWhat were you going to do?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cSit on the hill and spy on the beach,\u201d he said.</p><p>She laughed at him. \u201cI guess you think no one notices you there.\u201d She sat on the top step and twisted the cap off the beer. \u201cJust what do you think is going to happen out there?\u201d</p><p>He sat beside her. He twisted off his own cap. \u201cI\u2019ll know it when I see it,\u201d he said, taking a pull on the beer. \u201cMy relationship with Lou...it\u2019s getting to me. We\u2019re like an old married couple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, at least you recruited her,\u201d Gina said. \u201cAnd why wouldn\u2019t you be like that? You\u2019ve been together longer than most people our age have been married. Don\u2019t be stupid. Don\u2019t complain. You\u2019d be lost without her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be lost without her,\u201d he agreed. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s what annoys me. It\u2019s unnatural.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t cry to me. I live with my mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s something I\u2019ve been wanting to ask you,\u201d he said. \u201cAre you going to work at the diner for the rest of your life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you almost done with your degree?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost. I even have some credits toward a master\u2019s. I\u2019m a real speed demon. A short seventeen years to my high school diploma and almost a degree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t you be looking for something better? Where you don\u2019t have to wipe up after people?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d she asked. \u201cAre you seriously asking me that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I have no degree at all. No almost about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, first of all, Stu takes very good care of me. I make more money at the diner than I\u2019d make a lot of other places. I\u2019ve become indispensable to him, so he has to keep me happy. And I can do everything I need to do\u2014go to school part-time, take care of Ashley and keep up with all her activities, help my mom in the deli, get the days off I need as long as everything else is covered. Second, my degree will be in social work. I\u2019d have to work for the county. The pay is miserable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut there\u2019s benefits,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI have benefits. Maybe not the best benefits, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cRetirement?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cA little,\u201d she said. \u201cNot that I expect to retire. What are you getting at?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said, slumping a little bit. \u201cNone of my business, really, but sometimes I think you work too hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right about that,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I have a good gig going, Mac. One kid with a granny backup, a decent if not extraordinary education, some benefits, a boss who lets me take any time I need.\u201d She took a drink of her beer. \u201cThis was a good idea, a beer. Thanks. I could use better advice, though,\u201d she added.</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cI\u2019ll remember that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee that you do. It\u2019s really beautiful tonight. You don\u2019t notice things like that when you\u2019re in the middle of a wild and crazy football game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you met the new doctor yet?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cHave you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cBriefly. He stopped in to say hello before he started ripping the boards off the windows next door. His wife is dead, he\u2019s got a couple of little kids and he brought a babysitter with him. Very pretty.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cThat\u2019s an au pair, Mac. She\u2019s from Mexico. In exchange for room and board, an education and, with luck, citizenship, she\u2019s a full-time nanny. And she\u2019s about twelve.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, she\u2019s nineteen. And I hear the doctor is a hottie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019d you hear that?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She peered at him in the dark and lifted one brow. \u201cWhere do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRay Anne?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s keeping pretty close tabs on him.\u201d</p><p>Mac grinned. \u201cI think you stay at the diner because you have access to all the gossip there.\u201d</p><p>She grinned back. \u201cJust like at the cop shop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d he said. He was quiet for a long moment. \u201cAnother year and our girls will graduate. Go to college.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you mourning that already?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cHa! I\u2019m counting the days! Think they\u2019ll go to the same school?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo telling,\u201d she said. \u201cThat depends on whether Eve wants to follow Ashley, who will definitely follow Downy.\u201d</p><p>As Mac knew, Ashley had been dating her boyfriend, Downy, since he was a senior at Thunder Point High. Downy was now in his first year at State. In fact, Mac had been in his first year at State when he got his high school girlfriend knocked up. He shuddered. \u201cDoesn\u2019t that worry you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Gina said. \u201cDowny is a good boy, and Ash is an ambitious girl. So far they seem to make a good team. They don\u2019t want to get tripped up now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you\u2019re right,\u201d he said. He took a breath. \u201cAnd I hope Eve doesn\u2019t have a serious boyfriend until she\u2019s thirty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Gina asked. \u201cBecause that\u2019s the way she\u2019ll be most happy?\u201d</p><p>Mac just looked at her. Gina was so pretty, so smart. If it weren\u2019t for all the complications in their lives, all the responsibilities, now would be a logical time to pull her closer, kiss her in a way that left her trembling. But he wouldn\u2019t. \u201cThat\u2019s the thing,\u201d he said. \u201cYou and I both know that the thing that makes us most happy at sixteen doesn\u2019t work out to be so smart at thirty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr thirty-five?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cOr thirty-five,\u201d he confirmed.</p> <p>After a long silence she said, very softly, \u201cOne of these days, Mac, you\u2019re going to discover you have no regrets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d he questioned.</p><p>\u201cNothing. I have to get to bed. I work early and I\u2019m freezing. Done with that beer? Want me to pitch it for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah.\u201d He handed it over. \u201cThanks. And thanks for keeping me company for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnytime. Buddy.\u201d</p><p>Cooper called another one right\u2014the town was packed with vehicles and people spilling out onto the sidewalks around fast-food restaurants and the diner, but Cliffhanger\u2019s wasn\u2019t busy. In fact, though it was barely after nine, Cooper wondered if they were thinking of closing. He went straight to the bar, \u201cLooks kind of quiet,\u201d he said to Cliff. \u201cThere\u2019s time for a couple of burgers, right?\u201d</p><p>Landon, wearing his letter jacket, walked in behind him. Now that they were in a well-lit restaurant, Cooper noticed the bruise on Landon\u2019s cheek and wondered where that had come from.</p><p>\u201cCome on, man,\u201d Cliff said good-naturedly. \u201cI want to find out about the game. Word is those Badgers finally got what was coming to \u2019em.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can help with that,\u201d Cooper said. He dropped an arm casually around Landon\u2019s shoulders. \u201cI promised the quarterback a burger.\u201d</p><p>Cliff broke into a grin. \u201cYou got it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd give me a draft\u2014I\u2019ve had a hard night.\u201d</p><p>Landon shot him a look. \u201cYou\u2019ve had a hard night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure. Dupre? For you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDraft,\u201d he said.</p><p>Cliff smiled. \u201cNice try. Second choice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. Coke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrab a table, boys. I\u2019ll put in your order and get your drinks.\u201d</p><p>Cooper pointed to a table, knowing a minor couldn\u2019t sit up at the bar. When they were seated, Landon said, \u201cThat could\u2019ve been a mistake. We might draw a crowd.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay. We just have to get a couple of things straight. It won\u2019t take long. That kid, Jag, asked you to throw a game to get him back to first string, right? And when you said no, he threatened you. If I hadn\u2019t come along, he was going to beat you up. You can\u2019t let it go, Landon. Trust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll handle it....\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you would\u2014eventually. Listen, this kind of bullying isn\u2019t a first. It also isn\u2019t rare, which ought to disgust the whole human race. In every junior high and high school, and sometimes even elementary school, there\u2019s some idiot who anoints himself king. He gathers up some plebes who are either as mean as he is or stupid enough to think if they stick with the self-proclaimed leader, they won\u2019t get hurt. Then they search out their victims and make a lifestyle out of working \u2019em over. Terrible things come out of it. At least you were important enough to be threatened, because you\u2019re actually a threat, but that doesn\u2019t make it easier. I have one question. Did you ever think about it? Just doing what he wanted you to do?\u201d</p><p>Landon looked shocked. He shook his head. \u201cYou say you get it, but you don\u2019t. I wasn\u2019t the only one they wanted to cheat, I was just the only one they promised to beat up. That fumble? Right before the end of the first half? You think that guy lost control of the ball? He\u2019d be one of the plebes. He dropped that ball for Morrison.\u201d</p><p>Cooper couldn\u2019t help it, he grinned. Jag Morrison had himself a gang that worked hard for him, even at their own expense. But instead of letting the fumble go\u2014maybe letting the game go\u2014Landon stepped up, recovered the ball and ran it. He brought his A-game.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t just about me,\u201d Landon continued. \u201cYou spend ten minutes in the halls at school and you get how much it means to them, beating those Badgers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven though you could get hurt,\u201d Cooper said. It was not a question.</p><p>\u201cYou think the only way I might get hurt is being jumped in the parking lot or dragged under the bleachers? I have to play against my own team and the other team\u2014they are not about protecting their quarterback.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you saying all of them are in it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, just a few. But sometimes the right few. At least I know which ones they are.\u201d</p><p>Cooper nodded at Landon\u2019s face. \u201cAnd the bruise?\u201d</p><p>Landon ducked briefly. \u201cI walked into a door.\u201d</p><p>Cooper was quiet for a moment. Then he said, \u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>The drinks came and Cooper was thinking, damn kid has no idea what kind of athletic skill that takes\u2014trying to score with a good defense and with your own team working against you. Where the hell was the coach?</p><p>Cliff put down the drinks and pulled up a chair. \u201cYour burgers are coming, so while we wait, why don\u2019t you tell me about the game?\u201d</p><p>Cooper watched as Landon gave Cliff a play-by-play. His own nieces and nephews were not yet teenagers, though they were certainly getting there too quickly. Besides his friends\u2019 kids, whom he knew very casually, this might be his first experience with a young man of sixteen. And it was most definitely his first experience with a kid like Landon.</p><p>Landon played it straight, excusing the fumbles, lack of defense and missed passes and dismissing his own plays, which were nothing short of heroic. He was fast as lightning and could jump over fallen opponents. He said things like, \u201cThat was a lucky break,\u201d and \u201cI bet that doesn\u2019t happen twice.\u201d He never suggested members of his own team worked against him or even that what he\u2019d managed had taken talent.</p><p>Their food arrived and Cliff stuck around. They lingered over burgers and football talk for more than an hour and Cooper was glad to see Landon getting the attention he deserved, praise he didn\u2019t get much of from his team.</p><p>When they were in the parking lot, Landon said, \u201cYou had tips?\u201d</p><p>Cooper just laughed. \u201cNot on playing football, that\u2019s for sure. You\u2019ve got that down. It\u2019s getting late...\u201d</p><p>\u201cLate? How old are you?\u201d Landon asked with a hint of humor.</p><p>\u201cRight now I feel real old. You\u2019ll probably have that dog out for a walk this weekend. And I\u2019ll probably be around that old shack on the beach.\u201d</p><p>Gina and Mac had been good friends since the time their daughters had hooked up as best friends when they were twelve. The first time he showed up at Gina\u2019s house to check out her surroundings before letting Eve spend the night with her new best friend, Gina had fallen for him. She never let on, of course. They had a couple of teenage girls to watch over. But they always ended up sitting together at town events, school functions, that sort of thing. There was the occasional beer on her front porch or even at Cliff\u2019s, but the best was morning coffee at the diner when it wasn\u2019t busy. She could set her watch by him. At around ten o\u2019clock, barring pressing police work, he\u2019d come into the diner. Six days a week. Fishermen were out at dawn or before; the lunch crowd didn\u2019t show until eleven-thirty. Between breakfast and lunch was when they\u2019d catch up on gossip, scheduling and kids\u2019 activities. Mac and Gina, Aunt Lou and Carrie backed each other up when it came to carpooling and chaperoning. Between all of them, plus teachers and coaches, they ran herd on these girls and Mac\u2019s other two younger kids. They were not going to let Eve and Ashley fall victim to the kind of mistakes their mothers had made.</p><p>Their rapport was good. Gina could feel the sexual tension building in the light touch of hands, the smile or laugh, the conversation about things in their lives that had nothing to do with their daughters.</p><p>After about a year of relying on each other, trading news and confidences, there had been a kiss; a breathless embrace. They pushed apart desperately but reluctantly. And yet there was a second time, lasting a bit longer, that felt even more passionate to Gina. She had been in the ecstasy of expectation. She had felt for some time that they were more than buddies.</p><p>But at their morning coffee after that second embrace and kiss, Mac had confronted it. He seemed remorseful. \u201cWe can\u2019t let this happen,\u201d he had told her. \u201cWe have daughters who are best friends, a lot of responsibilities, people depending on us. Carrie and Lou...and I have a whole town, not to mention two more children...\u201d</p><p>She remembered clearly\u2014and with embarrassment\u2014that her mouth had hung open. After a year of sharing details of their lives, some of which she considered deeply personal, and after two hot and meaningful kisses, he was running for his life?</p><p>\u201cRelationships are fragile,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve both been through it. We can\u2019t experiment with this...this getting closer. If it didn\u2019t work, look how many people would be affected. Mostly, there\u2019s you and I. We\u2019ve already had our guts ripped out, right?\u201d</p><p>She was stunned silent for a moment. She was so offended. Hurt. \u201cRight,\u201d she finally said. \u201cDr. Phil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGina, you\u2019re special. Damn, I just want to do the right thing.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t seem to realize he\u2019d just drawn blood with his gentlemanly comment. She sensed that her instinctive response\u2014Then throw me down and have your amazing way with me\u2014might scare him even more.</p><p>So, apparently the one thing they did not have in common was readiness. After becoming an unmarried teenage mother, Gina hadn\u2019t actually dated again until Ashley was in school. In the ten years since then there hadn\u2019t been very many dates and only one guy had been semiserious. Emphasis on the semi. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cYour friendship is important to me,\u201d he told her. \u201cI need it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Your friendship is important to me, too,\u201d she had said. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t kiss you. I kissed you back. And I wanted to. So understand something, Mac. If you ever do anything like that again, you better mean it. And you better not turn and run.\u201d</p> <p>After a long silence, he said, \u201cUnderstood.\u201d</p><p>She pulled back then, gathered in her emotions and desires like poker chips she\u2019d just won, so he wouldn\u2019t know. Because she didn\u2019t want him if he didn\u2019t want her. She hadn\u2019t needed Dr. Phil to tell her relationships were risks. That was the point, wasn\u2019t it? She wasn\u2019t fifteen anymore. She no longer risked her heart without weighing all the facts. She knew him well enough and knew enough about him to realize he\u2019d be worth it.</p><p>But she wouldn\u2019t have him unless he also thought that of her.</p><p>So for years they\u2019d continued as friends, had midmorning coffee together, sat together at games and watched their daughters cheer, worked as a team at too many pancake breakfasts and school carnivals to count, and remained best friends and confidants without any pesky kissing. Or fondling. Or anything.</p><p>But she still felt that lilt in her chest when he walked in the door. She tried to tamp it down, but her blue eyes glowed. He sat down at the counter, diner empty, and she filled his cup with a smile. \u201cI don\u2019t think this town is going to get over last night\u2019s game anytime soon,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cI know I won\u2019t. I\u2019m hoarse. I could hardly sleep. I\u2019m still vibrating under the skin. Thanks for bringing over a beer last night\u2014that was nice of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEve didn\u2019t get in until twelve forty-five.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter the biggest game of the year? Of five years? What an impossible child. I think you should ground her for life. Or just execute her.\u201d</p><p>Mac smiled that lazy one-sided smile. \u201cI didn\u2019t say a word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you were waiting up,\u201d she said with a lift of her light brown eyebrows over twinkling eyes.</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s a given.\u201d</p> <p>She knew that he\u2019d want to be sure Eve came home in shape\u2014not traumatized, compromised, inebriated, using, holding, et cetera. The cop in him gave him the experience to make very good judgments, but it was the father in him who cared about the child. A couple of times he\u2019d asked Gina for advice, because teenage girls don\u2019t have to be in crisis to come home a mess. A failed date, a falling-out with a girlfriend, a disappointment\u2014any number of dramas could look like trouble. Sometimes it took a woman, a mother, to be able to separate the real trouble from its look-alike. She found herself honored that he\u2019d talk to her about those things even though he had Aunt Lou at home.</p><p>When Gina was a pregnant teenager and, later, as the single mother of a little one, she\u2019d have traded so much for any father figure for her baby. Now, with Ashley a teenager, she was proud of the parent she\u2019d become. But she\u2019d still give the moon for her daughter to have a father like Mac.</p><p>\u201cAshley was in by midnight, but that\u2019s because she brought her boyfriend with her. I tried to stay awake and listen to what was going on in the living room, but I didn\u2019t last long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s getting really serious, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Mac asked. \u201cAshley and Downy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou talk to her about that?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI talked to both of them,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t control their emotions but I can damn sure give them the facts and have a discussion about the consequences.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope we don\u2019t end up doing some damage in the other direction,\u201d he said, lifting his cup. \u201cWe could end up with two lonely old maids on our hands. I want our girls to have full lives, I just don\u2019t want them too full, too soon.\u201d</p> <p>Gina poured herself a cup of coffee. \u201cYou mean end up as two lonely old maids like us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d pay any amount of money for a few hours of loneliness,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get a break soon,\u201d she said. \u201cA day or two between football, hockey and basketball.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe should go see a movie,\u201d he said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t done that in a while.\u201d</p><p>This was not an overture\u2014they\u2019d gone to a few movies over the past few years. Despite the fact that neither of them ever saw other people, nothing romantic happened between them.</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d she said. \u201cNot a bloody one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the point, then,\u201d he joked. \u201cWe have to see something we can\u2019t experience in real life. Maybe a sci-fi, then. Or horror movie. Not some chick thing all about true love....\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me, Mac. I don\u2019t experience that in real life.\u201d</p><p>Silence hung out there and she thought, Don\u2019t you dare do this again! Unless you mean it!</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce we get through football, you can pick the movie.\u201d</p><p>Seven</p><p>Cooper found himself disappointed that he hadn\u2019t seen Landon all weekend. He did see the dog and the girl with the red slicker; she apparently walked that dog rain or shine. That would be Sarah, Landon\u2019s sister. She didn\u2019t come near the bait shop or dock, but the dog did. At the base of the steps that led to the beach, Ham ran right up to Cooper and dropped the ball at his feet. He gave it a mighty throw in the direction of the girl and that was the end of it. From that point on, the dog and girl headed back toward the town.</p><p>He still hadn\u2019t had a good look at her face, her hood pulled up and all. He had to wonder how this whole thing came to be. Here they were, Sarah and Landon, so far on the fringes of the community, both always alone. He\u2019d catch up with Landon eventually. After what he\u2019d seen, what he knew, Cooper wouldn\u2019t be missing a ball game from now on.</p><p>On Monday, the sun came out. The day was unseasonably warm on the beach and Cooper was sitting on the deck with his phone and laptop, trying to learn more about his friend. Ben, and perhaps his father before him, had an odd way of running their business. If they discovered a need, they tried to fill it. If someone needed a place to wash their clothes, voila! A Laundromat appeared, even if it served only a few people. A few breakdowns on the freeway? Buy a ninety-thousand-dollar tow truck.</p><p>Ben wasn\u2019t the only one with a patchwork business. Cooper had seen the same thing in many of the small towns he\u2019d passed through lately. Tires/Lube/Laundromat/Chinese Food/Dry Cleaning. It was a survival instinct.</p><p>He looked up as Mac came around the corner, his boots hitting the wood deck hard.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still here,\u201d Mac said by way of greeting.</p><p>\u201cStill here,\u201d Cooper answered. \u201cYou ready for me to move on?\u201d</p><p>Mac shrugged. \u201cNo matter to me. This is your place. What you have going there?\u201d Mac asked, indicating two closed laptops on the table beside Cooper. \u201cDueling computers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI found Ben\u2019s laptop. It\u2019s got a bunch of websites and message boards bookmarked on it, plus a lot of emails he saved, dating back about five years. I don\u2019t really expect to find anything, but I\u2019ll read through \u2019em.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor?\u201d Mac asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. It\u2019s not like Ben kept a journal, but there might be something important in there. Maybe I\u2019ll figure out what he expected from me. Maybe he wrote an email to someone about trouble he had around here or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to limit yourself to saved emails, you know,\u201d Mac said. \u201cYou can look through old and deleted emails and websites.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get to that eventually,\u201d Cooper said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll let me know if you find anything, right?\u201d Mac said.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. Rawley and I went through his things. Found Ben\u2019s old truck and a Razor, his off-road all-terrain vehicle, in that shed. I gave Rawley the truck. He didn\u2019t say thank you, just took the keys. But the truck\u2019s still sitting there. I guess he doesn\u2019t have a way to move it without asking someone to help and God forbid he ask me. That Rawley\u2014he didn\u2019t say ten words while we worked, but he\u2019s an interesting guy. Clothes he couldn\u2019t use that he wanted to give to the Vets, he washed them before he bagged them up to give away. I think he\u2019s the only reason that place didn\u2019t fall down years ago. Now the shack is empty, kind of clean, but full of mold we can\u2019t see. Uninhabitable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou comfortable in that thing?\u201d Mac asked, indicating the toy hauler.</p><p>Cooper laughed. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s a pain\u2014dry camping. I can\u2019t go a whole week before I have to muster that camper up the hill and down the freeway to an RV park where I can dump and fill the tank with water. I\u2019m cooking and cleaning dishes with bottled water, and I only shower with water from the tank, although I\u2019m sure it\u2019s safe. But at least the electricity is turned on so I can run an extension to the shack.\u201d</p><p>Mac laughed. \u201cIs that all you got for your time? Electricity?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure as hell not trusting the plumbing. But I have a plan. I have a bunch of contractors coming out this week to give me estimates on repairs and reconstruction. I think maybe I\u2019ll get the shack in shape and sell it. I\u2019ll just sell the structure and the parcel it\u2019s on, though. I\u2019m going to hang on to the beach and the point until I have a better idea of what to do.\u201d</p><p>Mac was clearly surprised. \u201cBut you\u2019re not going to open for business?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, that\u2019s just not me. Look at me, man. I\u2019m a nomad. Thirty-seven years old and all I have to show for it is a toy hauler and some toys. I\u2019ve never stayed long in one place. I wouldn\u2019t be here at all except for Ben. I can\u2019t stay here. Still...I don\u2019t have any objection to getting rich but I just can\u2019t sell off a beach and a promontory he obviously wanted to keep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re going to fix it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust to sell it,\u201d Cooper clarified. \u201cThen I\u2019m gone. I\u2019ll put someone in charge of the beach and the bird sanctuary. How about you? Pay you twenty-five bucks a month.\u201d</p><p>Mac laughed. \u201cWow, that\u2019s a hard offer to pass up. This project is going to set you back some, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s going to seriously cut into my nest egg, but I\u2019m going to sell Ben\u2019s tow truck. I finally saw it. He kept it at the Shell station in town and I think they\u2019ve been using it since he died. The look on the guy\u2019s face when I said I owned it and wanted to sell it was nothing short of grievous. Poor guy. He thought it was found property.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you were looking for it, Cooper. I could\u2019ve told you exactly where it was. Sorry about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it\u2014that was one of Rawley\u2019s ten words.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat tow truck, that was up his alley\u2014he liked to work on cars and trucks. He always kept Gina\u2019s old Jeep running for her. He wouldn\u2019t take money but I swear to God, when she told him something was wrong with it, his whole face lit up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess he wasn\u2019t as interested in working on this place. You know how old it is?\u201d Cooper asked. \u201cSome parts of it, more than fifty years. The deck is relatively new, but I don\u2019t see how it can survive a renovation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a strange guy, Cooper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that right?\u201d he asked, laughing.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do with yourself while this place gets worked on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess I\u2019ll help here and there. I\u2019m not a builder, but I\u2019m a competent helper. And I\u2019ll take in another football game or two\u2014haven\u2019t done that in years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to eat?\u201d Mac asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been feeding myself for a long time, Mac. No Auntie Lou in my kitchen. The food around here isn\u2019t bad at all. And I bought myself a little grill.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kind of high-class homeless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon. I have a master bedroom and a kitchen. And HDTV on satellite. And a great view. Speaking of views...I see just about everything that goes on down on the beach. I\u2019ve been wondering, if I saw something that disturbed me but that I didn\u2019t really want to get involved in, are you a guy I could mention it to?\u201d</p> <p>Mac got a slightly troubled look on his face, then he pulled up a chair and sat down. He rubbed a big hand down his face. His expression was serious when he said, \u201cI\u2019m not exactly your priest, Cooper. If you saw something I should know about, then yeah, I might want to look into it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou see anything illegal? Underage drinking? Drugs?\u201d</p><p>Cooper couldn\u2019t suppress a laugh. \u201cNah, haven\u2019t seen that, but I\u2019m sure there\u2019s plenty of that going on. The kids, they\u2019re not stupid\u2014they don\u2019t haul up a keg in the back of one of those Rhinos, but I\u2019d bet my right arm there\u2019s beer down there, tucked in a sleeve or small cooler. Might be pot, might be something else going on. But what if I saw someone getting...I don\u2019t know...intimidated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAssault?\u201d Mac asked.</p> <p>Cooper gave a shrug. \u201cI don\u2019t think I could call it that. Not quite. Teenage boys, they\u2019re gonna fight sometimes, right? If I saw some intimidating, shoving, that sort of thing, that\u2019s not something you can do anything about, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you let me be the judge of that, Cooper,\u201d Mac said, leaning toward him a little with that icy blue gaze looking right through him.</p><p>Cooper almost laughed. \u201cSo that\u2019s how you do it. Get the bad guys to talk. You look at \u2019em like you already know what they\u2019re going to say. So just on a hypothetical\u2014what could you do? About a little bullying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes all I have to do is talk to a few people. I am the law, after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are the law,\u201d Cooper agreed. \u201cTell you what, I\u2019ll pay attention. Right now the kid who\u2019s having a little trouble, he\u2019s real self-conscious about being a snitch. I\u2019ve been there\u2014you\u2019ve probably been there. I\u2019ll keep an eye on that, since I\u2019m here. I\u2019ll let you know if there\u2019s anything to tell. Deputy.\u201d Then he grinned.</p><p>Mac leaned back. \u201cYou do that. I\u2019d like you to remember, Eve spends some time with her friends on that beach. I don\u2019t want her getting shoved around....\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNah, I haven\u2019t seen anything like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t keep anything like that to yourself, would you?\u201d Mac asked. \u201cBecause girls are just as bad as boys, trust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take your word for that. Don\u2019t worry, if I saw Eve having issues down there, I\u2019d let you know right away.\u201d</p><p>Mac relaxed a little bit. \u201cI hate bullies,\u201d he said.</p><p>Cooper was back to his old self\u2014making decisions fast, full speed ahead. It took a total of five contractors in even fewer days to get a bid he could live with, both in time and money. It was a huge job, but it was going to be done as fast as possible during a wet and cold time of year. They\u2019d gut the bait shop, disposing of most of the interior. They could save the freezer, cooler, microwave and refrigerated cases where Ben had kept deli items. Rawley wanted to give the washers and dryers to some religious group he knew about\u2014they lived kind of isolated along a river south of Coquille and didn\u2019t have much. Cooper told him to take the pots, pans and dishes, too. He stored the unopened liquor in the shed alongside the quad and truck. As soon as Rawley got that truck out of there, Cooper would put his own toys in there. All the racks of cheap souvenirs were tossed. He wasn\u2019t keeping the bait tanks\u2014there was plenty of bait at the marina.</p><p>The bait tanks had been kept in the unfinished basement. The floor in the cellar was dirt and the walls cinder block. There was a door to the outside located under the deck, so fishermen could get their bait without walking through the bar. The room was large and deep and, remarkably, there was no mold or rot in the struts and beams, though they could use reinforcing.</p><p>Ben had fallen down the staircase that led to the cellar. Cooper kept looking at those stairs, wondering. How could this thing have happened to his friend? Ben was so freaking big...how could he have died from a fall? He should have left a big hole in the dirt floor instead. But wondering got him nowhere, and there was work to do.</p><p>Before all the junk had been carted off or the first nail driven in, Cooper started getting visitors from 101 on sunny days, mostly on the weekend. Bikers, cyclists, the occasional motorist\u2014folks who\u2019d been stopping off at Ben\u2019s for years and wondered when the place would be open again. They ranged from the young, fit athletes who pedaled across the countryside to those graybeards on Harleys that Mac had been talking about. It became evident Ben hadn\u2019t relied solely on beach traffic.</p> <p>Coop ended up spending a lot of time at the diner, showing Gina some of the plans. What he wanted to do was retain the things Ben and the town seemed to value most: the beach, the untouched promontory, the deli/bar, space for gathering.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why you\u2019re going to all this trouble,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can sell the place as-is and just that small parcel it sits on, plus the dock and road, and let the next owner worry about renovation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I want to sell a bar. A caf\u00e9. The same bar and deli that was there before, just in better shape, because I think the town relies on it, needs it. It\u2019s the only thing on the beach. And Ben wanted the beach open, for whatever reason. If I tear it down and sell that piece of land, who knows what you\u2019ll end up with in that spot. Could be a car wash or drive-in theater.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why do you care, Cooper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause my friend seemed to want it that way? Because people use Ben\u2019s place all the time, even when it\u2019s cold? Let\u2019s face it, if I let the whole thing go, it\u2019ll change everything about this place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome people would consider that a good thing,\u201d she said. \u201cNot me, though. The fact is, even though we aren\u2019t a rich town, we have a very low unemployment rate. A lot of people work away from Thunder Point, some as far as North Bend, but they work. This place doesn\u2019t have tearooms and souvenir shops, and the closest malls are in Bandon and Coquille. And we\u2019re out here on the ocean by ourselves. I like it that way.</p><p>\u201cBut there are lots of people who think we could do with more revenue for things like schools, libraries, parks, that sort of thing. And of course there\u2019s the real estate\u2014it would be worth so much more. There are people around here who are more than ready to make their killing, and they need a resort to do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no incentive to build fancy houses or condos in a dumpy little town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the north promontory?\u201d he asked. \u201cThe point opposite Ben\u2019s refuge on the other side of the bay. There must be land still available out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is. But the waterfront is owned by Cliff. He knows a big resort would put Cliffhanger\u2019s out of business. And his whole family has been in fishing for years. He wouldn\u2019t do as well if the marina was full of pleasure boats and all Ben\u2019s land was full of resort, the land surrounding the beach all condos and villas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot more to this town than I thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you think the kids could go build a bonfire on that beach after a ball game when Hyatt or Marriott owns it? There will be a security gate to get in!\u201d Then she grinned. \u201cSince you\u2019re still here, you going to the game?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t miss it,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWell, this one\u2019s in Coquille\u2014an away game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou going?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah, we have to go\u2014our girls are cheering. And it\u2019s kind of what we do.\u201d</p><p>We. He didn\u2019t miss that. \u201cYou and Mac?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Lou. The younger kids. Sometimes my mother.\u201d</p><p>He just smiled. \u201cSounds romantic,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cCooper, it\u2019s not romantic. We do stuff with the kids. We have since Eve and Ashley became friends. It works out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if your kids weren\u2019t friends?\u201d he found himself asking.</p><p>She leaned on the counter. \u201cWell, gee. Then I might ask him to the Sadie Hawkins dance, I guess. But that hasn\u2019t come up.\u201d She refilled his cup. \u201cHomecoming is in less than two weeks. There\u2019s a dance. I\u2019ll sign you up to chaperone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you thought I was being funny? It\u2019s the Saturday night after the Friday-night game. Dress nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet real, Gina.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m as real as it gets. Need directions to tomorrow night\u2019s game?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>Landon decided he was going to have to have a man-to-man talk with Cooper. He\u2019d been avoiding him, which wasn\u2019t too hard to do\u2014his sister had been around a lot and when she wasn\u2019t, he\u2019d had football practice and then a shit pot full of homework. But at Friday night\u2019s game in Coquille, Cooper had been there, spending most of his time hanging around the sidelines. One time, when Landon looked up, he\u2019d been talking to Eve\u2019s dad, the local law. He\u2019d been pointing at Landon and a couple of the other players; the deputy had been grim faced and nodding.</p><p>And that dog wouldn\u2019t hunt.</p><p>\u201cLandon?\u201d</p><p>He pulled one more book out of his locker and turned to find himself eye to eye with the most beautiful girl at Thunder High, Eve McCain. She was smiling at him and he returned the smile so fast, so lame, he felt like an instant loser. He felt like some idiot who\u2019d just won the lottery. He crumpled in the face of the sexiest girl on the planet.</p><p>He recovered his cool. \u201cHey,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cGood game, Friday night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. Not a real tough game.\u201d And thankfully they\u2019d let Jag Morrison, the future homecoming king, play a lot. Therefore Jag left him alone.</p><p>\u201cStill. So, I was going to wait till after Chemistry, but I was wondering who you\u2019re taking to the dance?\u201d</p><p>He gave a shrug. \u201cI probably won\u2019t go,\u201d he said.</p><p>She stiffened in shock. \u201cBut you have to go! Everyone on the team has to go!\u201d</p><p>He felt a laugh come to his lips. Jag Morrison was destined to be a real king, the homecoming king, a position only open to seniors. He\u2019d get that crown even if he had to buy it. Therefore that dance didn\u2019t feel like the ideal place to be, even if he wanted to go. \u201cI\u2019ll probably show up for a little while....\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...would you like to show up for a little while with me?\u201d she asked. And the usually bold and vivacious Eve blushed shyly. \u201cI mean, I can\u2019t believe you don\u2019t have a date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Wait. You don\u2019t have a date? You?\u201d He was thunderstruck, to borrow a phrase from one of their most famous cheers.</p><p>She laughed lightly and shook her head, clutching books tight against her chest. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty hard to ask, too, so try not to hurt my feelings too bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019d even... Jeez,\u201d he said, scratching his head. \u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d she shot back. \u201cI thought we were friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. Of course. Yes, we\u2019re friends, of course we are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>He thought for a moment before he said. \u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m sure. Can you drive or should I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can drive, sure. Maybe I can borrow my sister\u2019s ride. I just have that little truck. It\u2019s okay, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cLandon, the truck is fine for me. Whatever you want.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d he said. \u201cJust wow. I really can\u2019t believe no one asked you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I was asked, just not by the right person....\u201d She started to back away. \u201cBell\u2019s gonna ring...\u201d</p> <p>He snagged a piece of her sleeve. \u201cYeah? Who asked?\u201d</p><p>She grinned. \u201cWanna know your competition, huh? Well, he\u2019s not\u2014I can\u2019t stand him. I\u2019d never go out with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Landon asked, grinning hugely. \u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMorrison. Jag Morrison. He\u2019s just a stupid ass. I gotta go. See you later, like after practice or something.\u201d And she whirled around and was gone.</p><p>Landon turned back to his locker, closed it and let his head fall against the cold steel. Oh, man, he thought. I can\u2019t believe this is happening. My life is definitely over.</p> <p>Landon\u2019s sister worked two nights in a row in North Bend so she could be off the weekend of the high school homecoming game. That gave Landon just the right amount of freedom to check in with Cooper. It was a misty, moonless night, but he jogged Ham across the beach, confident there wouldn\u2019t be people out there. He saw the lights on in Ben\u2019s place and heard music, so he ran up the stairs to the deck and pounded on the door.</p><p>Cooper answered. He was wearing a dirty old sweatshirt covered with sawdust, a tool belt around his hips, a surgical-type mask over his mouth and nose and a crowbar in his hand. The music came from an old paint-splattered radio. Cooper pulled down the mask. \u201cWell, I thought you were avoiding me,\u201d he said with a grin. He looked down at the Great Dane, who sat patiently beside Landon. \u201cHello, Hamlet. Kind of calm tonight, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ran him across the beach.\u201d Landon almost forgot his mission. Cooper was surrounded by debris\u2014piles of wood, dismantled bar and shelves, boxes of what looked like Ben\u2019s things. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to clean the place up, renovate. So I can sell it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSell it? You\u2019re going to just sell it?\u201d Landon asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, it needs a lot of work first. But in a few months I\u2019ll sell this and the piece of land it sits on.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe have to talk,\u201d Landon said.</p><p>Cooper thought about this for a second, then put down the crowbar and removed the tool belt. \u201cLet\u2019s go in the house and get a drink. I don\u2019t suppose he knows how to wipe his feet?\u201d he said, shooting a look at Ham.</p><p>Landon pulled a rag out of his back pocket. \u201cI got it,\u201d he said.</p><p>The house was, of course, Cooper\u2019s fifth wheel, the toy hauler. Cooper went first, brushing off his shirt and pants. Landon did as he was asked, wiping the sand off Ham\u2019s feet and, for good measure, the drool off his mouth. When he stepped inside, he said, \u201cNice.\u201d Then, hanging on to the dog\u2019s collar, he picked a chair by the door and kept the dog sitting politely at his side.</p><p>Cooper went to the kitchen and washed up. He opened the refrigerator and helped himself to a beer. \u201cI have bottled water, tea, cola and Gatorade.\u201d</p><p>Landon shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be here long.\u201d</p><p>Cooper gave an impatient sigh and reached for a cola. He handed the can to Landon. \u201cYour sidekick there need a drink?\u201d</p><p>Knowing they were talking about him, Ham sat up a little straighter.</p> <p>\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t turn it down, thanks.\u201d</p><p>Cooper filled a saucepan with water, grabbed a towel to put under it and delivered the water.</p><p>\u201cRemind me never to have dinner here,\u201d Landon said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m planning to wash it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis place is nicer than I thought,\u201d Landon said. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t expect this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe toys are under the tarp behind the trailer. I have to keep it nice\u2014I live in it. I lived in it for two years in Corpus Christi. I couldn\u2019t see renting or buying anything when I had this. It\u2019s plenty for one person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t settle down, do you?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we have that in common,\u201d Landon said.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201d Cooper said, sitting on the couch across from Landon.</p><p>Instead of an answer, Landon said, \u201cListen, I saw you at the game. In Coquille.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was pretty obvious,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cI intended to be obvious. You didn\u2019t have any trouble, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but listen, you can\u2019t be telling the deputy what\u2019s going on. You can\u2019t. You\u2019ll just make it worse, I\u2019m telling you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t tell Mac you were getting shoved around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt looked like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what it looked like. We were talking football, talking plays. I pointed to a few players I knew, made sure they saw me pointing them out to the deputy, but we were talking football.\u201d He took a drink from his bottle of beer. \u201cThey can\u2019t beat you up if I tell on them, Landon. I was there, remember? I can talk about what I heard and saw and that doesn\u2019t make you a snitch.\u201d</p><p>Landon scooted forward on his chair. \u201cYou think they\u2019re going to see it that way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey may be stupid, Landon, but I do believe they know that if they beat you up, they\u2019re going to answer to me. And one of my only friends here is Mac, who seems to know what he\u2019s doing. You should tell him, but if you won\u2019t, I\u2019ll just look like the bad guy for a while. How\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t get into this, Cooper. You don\u2019t have to do this.\u201d</p><p>Cooper gave a shrug. \u201cListen, I was the new guy a lot when I was your age. I wasn\u2019t the star football player, but I always had trouble fitting in. And there was always some asshole who thought pushing me around and making my life miserable would be fun. By the way, I\u2019ve been meaning to ask you...what makes Morrison so special?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMoney, I think. His family is about the richest family around and he has two older brothers who have big football fame at Thunder High\u2014big athletic scholarships. Not pro ball kind of stuff, but they\u2019re a lot older and finished with college and everyone around here thinks the Morrisons are awesome. I only know Jag and he is not awesome. He\u2019s not even that much of a football player.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cThey live in that big house out on the point, right? Where do they get the money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell if I know,\u201d Landon said. \u201cThe brothers have trophies in the trophy case and people talk about them like they\u2019re legend. That\u2019s all I know. The coach and Mr. Morrison are old friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow convenient...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd my situation is just going to get more interesting because Jag asked Eve McCain to the homecoming dance and she said no.\u201d Cooper\u2019s eyebrows shot up. \u201cSo then she asked me. And I should\u2019ve said no, but I couldn\u2019t. I said yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMan, I should\u2019ve said no, just to keep her as far from this Morrison thing as possible, but I didn\u2019t know till after that he\u2019d asked her first. And my God, she\u2019s so hot. And nice, so nice. And funny, too. Plus, she said it was hard to ask me and also said to please not hurt her feelings too much.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI couldn\u2019t tell her no, man. It would\u2019ve killed us both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Morrison might just have more to be pissed about...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, now we do have an issue, because I gave Mac my word that if I saw anything going on that put his daughter in a bad place, I would definitely tell him....\u201d</p><p>Landon sat tall. \u201cAnd have you? Seen that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Landon, let\u2019s be straight here\u2014you\u2019re worried about it. You as much as said so....\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t think Morrison would ever do anything to Eve. But he\u2019d get even with me if he could.\u201d</p><p>Cooper relaxed, propping an ankle over his knee. He took a long, leisurely drink of his beer. Then he said, \u201cGood thing I go to games. And even though I was mad at her for it, it\u2019s a good thing Gina conned me in to helping her and Mac chaperone the dance.\u201d</p><p>Landon hit his head with the heel of his hand. \u201cAw, man!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy feeling exactly,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cSo, if you have any trouble, speak up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t say anything, Cooper,\u201d he said pleadingly.</p><p>\u201cI probably won\u2019t have to, but you should. You should at least tell the coach and, if necessary, tell Mac. You\u2019re going out with Eve. It\u2019s your job to keep her safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Tell Mr. Morrison\u2019s good friend, the coach....\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, you know what I think. Just think about what\u2019s the right thing to do, for Eve if not for yourself, okay? Now, let\u2019s change the subject. I haven\u2019t seen you in over a week, except at the game. Where\u2019ve you been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy sister has been around a lot. She\u2019s working tonight so me and Ham, we\u2019re on our own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you moved here because she got a divorce, but you said you\u2019re like me\u2014you don\u2019t settle down. Why\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy sister\u2019s job. She\u2019s reassigned every couple of years. Sometimes even more often. Our folks died right after she started with the Coast Guard. At first she was going to leave me with our aunt Frances, who is the aunt from hell, by the way. I begged and pleaded and finally just started running away a lot until not only did Sarah take me, Aunt Frances gave her a door prize for getting me off her hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot so close to Aunt Frances, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate her. She hates me. If she ever goes missing or her body turns up somewhere, I should be a suspect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see. Jesus, you\u2019re a lot of work,\u201d Cooper said.</p><p>\u201cOh, but I\u2019m not. I\u2019m easy. I never get in trouble, I get good grades, I take care of things at home and you know why? Because all Sarah has to do to straighten me right out is say Aunt Frances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell did Aunt Frances do to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGeneral bitching, 24/7. She screamed, she slapped. She locked me in my room, took away dinner, hated me and punished me every second.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGotcha,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cI guess a big kid like you couldn\u2019t deal with that.\u201d</p><p>The look that came into Landon\u2019s eyes was almost scary. \u201cI was five,\u201d he said seriously. \u201cA five-year-old kid whose parents had just been killed in an accident.\u201d</p><p>Cooper just connected with that stare for a long time and said nothing. \u201cWhat about your uncle?\u201d he finally asked.</p><p>\u201cNo uncle,\u201d Landon said. \u201cOne of the many things that probably made her such a bitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAunt Frances doesn\u2019t sound like a nice person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a nice person.\u201d</p><p>Cooper leaned back. He drank a little of his beer. Then he said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, man. So. What does Sarah do for the Coast Guard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSearch and rescue. She\u2019s a helicopter pilot.\u201d</p><p>Cooper choked. Then he coughed. Finally, he said, \u201cThat right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need me to pound on your back?\u201d Landon asked.</p><p>\u201cNah, I\u2019m okay,\u201d he rasped. \u201cHelicopter pilot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. She works out of the North Bend station. She\u2019s pretty senior but she has to sit alert sometimes. Overnight. She finally trusts me enough to leave me without a keeper. I think Ham here was a trick to hedge her bets\u2014he has to be fed and let out, so I have to be home to do that. She has the old neighbors next door monitoring my truck\u2014they don\u2019t have anything better to do but look out the window and watch when I come home from school, leave for school, that kind of thing. And she calls me. A lot.\u201d</p><p>On cue, Landon\u2019s cell phone rang. He answered, \u201cYes, my queen?\u201d</p><p>Cooper laughed and shook his head. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cI took Ham out for a run and stopped at Ben\u2019s place.

Sarah and her husband used to keep separate schedules so I always had one of them around, but since the divorce she\u2019s been a little neurotic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI completely understand,\u201d Cooper said.</p><p>Landon laughed. \u201cNo, you don\u2019t, but that\u2019s okay. I\u2019m doing the best I can with her. She\u2019ll lighten up eventually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me to call you? Make sure you got home okay?\u201d Cooper asked.</p> <p>Landon shot him a look. \u201cBite me,\u201d he said, opening the door.</p><p>\u201cHold on,\u201d Cooper said, calling him back. He went to the kitchen counter and grabbed his cell phone. \u201cProgram my number into your phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you can call me if you need me,\u201d Cooper said. When Landon just stared at him and made no move to get his phone out of his pocket, Cooper went on. \u201cLook, I\u2019m going to be here awhile and I don\u2019t have any ties. I don\u2019t even have a dog. I\u2019m usually around\u2014no job and only a couple of friends. I\u2019m the best person for you to call if you have some kind of, I don\u2019t know, problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike if I\u2019m getting beat up under the bleachers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr if you run out of gas. Or the dog eats a bunch of fishing hooks and lures and wants to die and needs the vet and your sister is out rescuing other people. Or the old couple next door get in the cross fire when the mob is trying to take you out. Or\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, yeah, okay,\u201d he said, bringing out the phone. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>Cooper fed him the numbers. Landon plugged them in and put the phone away. \u201cI want yours,\u201d Cooper said.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Cooper took a breath. \u201cIn case I need help. In case I\u2019m gagging on the mold in that shack of Ben\u2019s. In case\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right! Jesus!\u201d Landon reeled off the numbers. \u201cThere. We\u2019re all hooked up. But don\u2019t be calling me. I have enough people watching me!\u201d</p><p>Cooper chuckled as he watched Landon and Hamlet jog down the steps to the beach. Then he sat down to drink his beer and grew more serious. A picture came to mind unbidden\u2014a little five-year-old kid, the family he knew snatched away from him, being slapped. A kid that age and size being starved as punishment? He should\u2019ve been allowed anything; he should\u2019ve been allowed to eat marshmallows for dinner if that got him through. And a five-year-old runaway? He was damn lucky to be alive.</p><p>Aunt Frances was going to have to work very hard to stay out of hell.</p><p>And yet this kid...look at him now. Just the kind of kid the deputy should want to take his daughter to the dance\u2014athletic, humble, intelligent, humorous. Responsible. Who got the credit for that? Was Landon just an old soul? Or did the sister do something special?</p> <p>Cooper had been hanging around because he was curious about Ben\u2019s life, Ben\u2019s town. Now he realized he had another reason. Landon shouldn\u2019t be let down again.</p><p>Eight</p><p>When Landon got home from Cooper\u2019s, he waited until about nine, then dug out the school roster he had for chem lab and dialed Eve\u2019s cell phone. He\u2019d never called her before. He never would\u2019ve had the stones to call her for anything but chemistry if Cooper hadn\u2019t said something about how his job was to keep her safe. He dreaded this, but fair was fair.</p><p>She answered sleepily. \u201cHullo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, hi. It\u2019s Landon. Damn, did I wake you up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm, no, but I was reading history, which to me is as good as taking a nap. What\u2019s up, Landon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...I have to talk to you about something. About the dance. We might have a problem...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no!\u201d she said, suddenly alert. \u201cYou\u2019re going to hurt my feelings now, aren\u2019t you? You changed your mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! No way. But listen...\u201d He paused and scratched his head. \u201cEve, I don\u2019t want to make a big deal out of this, but I should tell you something. Something about Jag.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? That he\u2019s an ass?\u201d</p><p>Landon couldn\u2019t help it, he laughed. \u201cYeah, there\u2019s that. And also, he\u2019s not exactly happy with me these days.\u201d</p><p>To his surprise, now she laughed. \u201cLandon, he\u2019s not going to be happy with anyone who can play football.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe really thought, being a senior, this was supposed to automatically be his year to rule. He\u2019d be mad at anyone who did better than him. Ignore him, he\u2019s a loser.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh,\u201d he said again, but this time it wasn\u2019t a question. \u201cThing is, he\u2019s a lot worse than not friendly. It\u2019s like he\u2019s gunning for me, y\u2019know? It\u2019s pretty hard to ignore someone who slams you into the lockers whenever he gets a chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously? Landon, you can\u2019t let him do that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t usually travel alone, Eve. He\u2019s got a pack.\u201d</p><p>She made a growling sound. \u201cAnd I know exactly who they are, too. Sinclair, Wormitz and Pickering. All losers. You should tell someone. Like the coach, maybe.\u201d</p><p>He rubbed a hand through his hair. \u201cI think it\u2019s different with girls, Eve. You know what it makes a guy look like if he can\u2019t handle it? I don\u2019t want to tell anyone, I want to handle it. He flies under the radar. He always manages to catch me at least semi-alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he\u2019s a sneak and a liar. Want me to tell someone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! No. Listen, I only wanted to tell you because you and me, at the dance, it\u2019s going to look to Jag like he lost one more thing to me. And I don\u2019t want anything bad to happen to you. I don\u2019t want him to even call you a name. You might want to rethink this idea of us going together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I will. In fact, I just gave it a big rethink. Ashley asked me to double with her and her boyfriend and I thought no. I didn\u2019t want to throw you into the deep end with people you barely know. But now maybe yes is a better idea. You haven\u2019t been here long enough to get to know Ash\u2019s boyfriend\u2014he graduated last year. Crawford Downy. He just goes by Downy.\u201d</p><p>He was silent for a moment. Thunder Point was proud of its football stars. Their pictures and trophies were displayed in the school\u2019s hallways. \u201cIsn\u2019t he at State?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. But he\u2019s crazy about Ash and doesn\u2019t like her to miss all the important high school things, and he sure doesn\u2019t want her going with anyone else. Anyway, he\u2019s all-conference alumni\u2014he\u2019ll be back for the game. He\u2019s a very nice guy. And he\u2019s also a big guy, very big.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo if it\u2019s not a problem for you, we\u2019ll double. Not for me,\u201d she said. \u201cJag wouldn\u2019t dare give me trouble. I\u2019m not new here anymore, I have plenty of friends, plus there\u2019s my dad... He\u2019s not going to bother me. And he better not give you any more trouble. He\u2019s such a creep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa,\u201d Landon said again. \u201cBut listen, if you could somehow manage not to spread around that I was crying about getting picked on...\u201d</p><p>\u201cLandon, I wouldn\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that it\u2019s kind of humiliating to have your girlfriend running interference...\u201d When the words were out of his mouth, he cringed and hit himself in the forehead with the heel of his hand. He ground his teeth and listened to the long silence.</p><p>\u201cAm I your girlfriend?\u201d she asked softly.</p><p>\u201cWell, that position is definitely still open....\u201d</p><p>She laughed at him. \u201cWhere do I apply?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can apply right now if you\u2019re any good at chemistry. It\u2019s really kicking my ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re better than I am. Didn\u2019t you get an A on the last test?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to get A\u2019s or my sister will finish the ass-kicking job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe should hook up your sister and my dad. He needs a woman in his life to get him out of mine and Aunt Lou\u2019s. We\u2019re getting kind of tired of his hypervigilance.\u201d</p><p>Landon kicked off his shoes and lay down on the couch with his phone to his ear. Ham settled in on the floor beside him. \u201cIs that a fact?\u201d he asked. \u201cBe patient. Sarah got a divorce less than a year ago. She wants all men killed. All except me\u2014I still get a pass.\u201d</p><p>They talked like that for an hour, about their families, about school, about moving to a new town and settling in. Landon hadn\u2019t done much of this kind of late-night, long talking on the phone to a girl. He\u2019d never been shy, but he\u2019d always been a little uncertain around girls. He just couldn\u2019t believe they liked him. Athletically, he was confident; academically, not so much, but he was willing to put all his muscle into schoolwork. He had to. The only way he was going to go to college was on scholarship. But girls? There, his confidence failed him.</p><p>Eve McCain was easily the prettiest, smartest, best girl in school. They were in three classes together and he\u2019d been watching her since school started, admiring everything about her. But even though they\u2019d talked, he hadn\u2019t approached her. He was friendly, he was helpful, but he\u2019d been through too much lately and couldn\u2019t handle rejection. He hadn\u2019t had a date yet in his life, unless you counted gang dates for pizza or parties after games, and that was at his old school in North Bend, where he\u2019d also been the new kid. He\u2019d been invited to join \u201cthe crowd\u201d at the Thunder Point beach, but given Morrison would be there, he\u2019d made excuses and never went.</p><p>So after a rocky few months, this felt brand-new. And very sexy.</p><p>School let out early on Friday for the homecoming festivities, but not before a student assembly for the coronation. Since attendance wasn\u2019t required, the kids who didn\u2019t want to be involved in school activities skipped out. Landon considered leaving, but in the end, he was curious. He tucked himself into the back of the auditorium and watched.</p><p>There was a lot of pomp; the cheerleaders performed\u2014minus the one cheerleader who was a homecoming queen candidate\u2014the principal spoke, the football coach revved them up. Then the band played while the candidates walked down the auditorium aisles to the stage. They were all dressed up in formal gowns and nice suits. On the stage, they met, touched hands, gave a brief bow to the assemblage, separated and stood in a line of four girls and four boys. They would all ride in the parade later. After that, the football players would race into the locker room and dress for the game tonight.</p><p>Finally the results of the vote were announced. Stacy Kraemer and Justin Moore were crowned by last year\u2019s royalty. Justin Moore? Not Jag? There was a part of him that thought, Karma\u2019s a bitch, man. But another part of him knew that Jag Morrison would be in an even worse mood tonight. He\u2019d been pretty cocky about this whole king business. It was customary to crown the football captain\u2014unless he was an ass who not too many people liked. Justin was a tight end and good at his job; he didn\u2019t hang with Jag.</p><p>Straight after the coronation was the parade setup. Each class had made a float. It wasn\u2019t the Rose Bowl parade, but as floats went they weren\u2019t too bad. Since only seniors could be nominated for homecoming king and queen, their class always got the float that bore the thrones. Justin and Stacy took their places, ready for the parade to begin. The juniors had a papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 cougar on their float; the sophomores celebrated the harvest with a football player in its midst; and the freshmen paid tribute to the fishing industry with the bow of a boat and a papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 marlin, even though you\u2019d never catch a marlin this far north off the Pacific coast. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>The band led the floats down Thunder Point\u2019s main street and they made two loops on the track around the football field. When the parade reached the track, Justin Moore jumped off the seniors\u2019 float to go dress out for the game. There was a lot of noise, laughter and trash talk in the locker room and Landon acknowledged that maybe, just maybe, Jag Morrison wasn\u2019t king of the school, just the prince of a very small clique. That was somehow a little less intimidating. Finally, as the band played the school song, the team burst through a paper sign stretched across the goalpost to the cheers of the crowd.</p><p>Landon didn\u2019t have high expectations for the homecoming game. They\u2019d beat Stafford High before and they weren\u2019t a strong team. Good for homecoming and good for Jag. As Landon had expected, Coach Rayborough started Jag in the game. Landon didn\u2019t mind staying on the sidelines, watching the game and other things. He caught sight of Cooper standing at the end of the bleachers for a while in the beginning, then he disappeared. He recognized Crawford Downy from his picture in the school\u2019s trophy case. Downy was knocking fists with old friends, talking with the coach as if he was assisting.</p> <p>But the game went downhill. Jag fumbled. He threw two incomplete passes and then he threw an interception and Stafford scored. The coach brought him in, talked to him, knocked him on the helmet, sent him back. Fumble, fumble, Stafford recovered the ball and ran it. Not too far, but they were clearly headed for another touchdown. Thunder\u2019s defense rallied, got the ball and Jag threw another incomplete pass. The score was 7\u20130 Stafford. Coach wouldn\u2019t want to get to halftime behind.</p><p>\u201cDupre!\u201d</p><p>He was being brought in. Landon jogged over to the coach, got his instructions and went onto the field. He recovered the ball from Stafford. He went into the huddle, called the play, received the ball. He backed away from Stafford\u2019s offense and made a perfect pass that landed them within running distance of a touchdown. When he next got the ball, he passed to a wide receiver and Thunder scored. The crowd went wild. Even though he hadn\u2019t run the ball, they chanted his name, along with the wide receiver\u2019s. But the attention wasn\u2019t as much fun as executing the play\u2014making it happen, getting a win. Landon just plain loved the game. He could feel the pressure and excitement of that down to his toes. By the half, they had Stafford by three points.</p><p>Landon figured the coach would pull him now and let Jag have another shot, but he didn\u2019t. In fact, he didn\u2019t let Jag play again until the end of the game, when they had Stafford by fourteen points and there wasn\u2019t much time left. Jag tried valiantly to score and failed, but at least he didn\u2019t give the ball to Stafford.</p><p>During a time-out, Eve crept over to where he stood on the sidelines with the team and whispered that they were still decorating the gym for tomorrow night\u2019s dance, if he wanted to help. He told her he\u2019d be there after the game.</p> <p>When the game ended, Thunder High had a big win and were rewarded by screaming, thumping, yelling noises from the stands. Landon got a lot of fist bumps and slaps on the back, and he congratulated his teammates, too. He noticed that Jag was morose, lagging behind the team, but he ordered himself to ignore him as they jogged off the field and into the locker room.</p><p>He\u2019d barely gotten his shoes off when the coach called him to his office. He stepped into the small room with a glass window to the lockers to find Downy leaning one hip against Coach\u2019s desk.</p><p>\u201cHere he is, Downy. Meet Landon Dupre. Landon, this is Crawford Downy. He took us all the way to the state play-offs last year.\u201d</p><p>Downy put out his hand. \u201cWe had a good team. Nice to meet you, Dupre. Good job out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, thanks,\u201d Landon said, taking his hand. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I never got to see you play.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you\u2019ll end up at State and we\u2019ll play together.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow did you end up at State?\u201d Landon asked.</p><p>\u201cScholarship. State wasn\u2019t the only option, though,\u201d Downy said.</p><p>They talked a little bit about Oregon State\u2019s record, about the fact that Landon was hoping for some help with college tuition, about double-dating for the dance. Downy continued, \u201cAnyway, we have lots of time to talk about college life this weekend. I got sucked into decorating tonight, because that\u2019s where Ashley\u2019s going to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll see you there. I was recruited by Eve.\u201d</p><p>They shook hands again. By the time Landon got back to the locker room, most of the team was either dressing or exiting the showers. In the coach\u2019s office, he could see Downy. He looked completely at home, still leaning on the desk, laughing with his old coach while Coach Rayborough leaned back in his chair.</p><p>Landon stripped down, wrapped a towel around his waist and headed for the showers. From his office, the coach could see the locker area; the coach\u2019s office was a no-female zone while guys were dressing. The shower area and the latrines were out of sight. The last three guys, toweling off and laughing, exited the shower just as Landon was going in.</p><p>\u201cGreat game, Dupre!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShow us the Thunder, Dupre!\u201d</p> <p>He just smiled and went about his business. He was planning to make it fast. Eve was in his very near future. He was lathered up, his hair loaded with suds, when he heard his name. \u201cDupre.\u201d</p><p>He pried open one eye and peered at Jag Morrison, leaning in the doorway to the showers. He was fully dressed in pleated pants, thin-soled brown shoes and a navy sweater. The sleeves were shoved up on his forearms to show off his gold watch. His hands were in his pants pockets, one leg crossed over the other. He was a damn GQ ad.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Landon asked. \u201cLittle busy here.\u201d He let the spray hit him, rinsing off much of the dripping soap.</p><p>\u201cNo one likes a wise guy, Dupre. Don\u2019t think you can come here and just take over. I told you, this is my turf.\u201d</p><p>Landon wiped a hand down his face. \u201cWhere\u2019s your posse, Morrison? You don\u2019t usually come at me alone. I figure you\u2019re afraid I\u2019ll wipe up the floor with you.\u201d</p><p>Jag took a step into the shower room. \u201cIn your dreams. I just stopped by to tell you your party is about over here.\u201d</p><p>Landon laughed at him. \u201cIs that so? Kind of looks more like your party already ended. Now get out of here, unless you\u2019re only here to view some naked male.\u201d Then he turned, presented his back and leaned into the shower. After a few seconds he looked over his shoulder and sighed in relief. Morrison was gone.</p><p>Both palms braced against the wall, Landon let the hot water wash over his head and down his face. He\u2019d never spoken a word to Morrison before the trouble began. A couple of practices before school started had revealed Landon to be the stronger quarterback and that was all it took. Don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to start the game, Dupre. This is my team. That first threat had worked out pretty well for Jag\u2014Landon hadn\u2019t started. The coach gave Jag every opportunity and only put Landon in when Jag couldn\u2019t carry or pass the ball. But he couldn\u2019t keep him out all the time, and it wasn\u2019t long before Jag told Landon to trip and drop the ball. When that didn\u2019t work, Jag and his gang of three started delivering their physical threats\u2014a slug, a shove, an attempted trip. That night under the bleachers had been the worst episode. Cooper had saved his ass, but he\u2019d got the message: they\u2019d hold him down to beat him up.</p><p>\u201cDupre.\u201d</p><p>He turned suddenly and just as suddenly an elbow or a bat or whatever it was slammed the side of his head into the hard tiles. The shower handle hit him in the ribs. On the way down, as he scrambled for something to grip, the lever hit him in the face.</p><p>Then it was lights-out.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a damn fine ball player,\u201d Coach Rayborough was telling Downy. \u201cBut he\u2019s having a little trouble fitting in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll pass, if he\u2019s a good guy,\u201d Downy said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I think. He works hard, never misses a practice, plays his heart out, supports his teammates...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about grades?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever had a problem with his grades,\u201d Coach said. \u201cNot like some of the seniors on the team, who are hanging on by the hair on their teeth.\u201d He looked through the window into the quiet locker room. Everyone was gone, even the trainers. \u201cLet\u2019s shut \u2019er down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea,\u201d Downy said. \u201cI\u2019ve gotta go string lights and blow up balloons tonight. If I play my cards right, it could all end in a date.\u201d</p><p>They were laughing as they exited the office. Before turning off the lights, the coach looked into the locker room. There were a few wet towels strewn over benches. \u201cSomeone forgot to close his locker,\u201d he muttered, walking toward the open locker.</p><p>The dawning came slowly\u2014the locker was not only open, the player\u2019s clothes were inside, the duffel holding his football uniform and gear sitting on the floor, shoes under the bench, shower running...</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d he yelled. \u201cSomebody in there?\u201d</p><p>No answer. Coach Rayborough walked toward the showers. It wouldn\u2019t be the first time some idiot left the water running. They get a little hyper after a\u2014</p><p>\u201cDowny! Call nine-one-one!\u201d</p><p>The coach shut off the shower and knelt beside Landon. The second he lifted the kid\u2019s head, Landon started to groan. His head lolled.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Dupre, what the hell? You pass out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t pass out,\u201d Downy said from the door. \u201cEMTs are on the way.\u201d</p><p>Landon tried to sit up, moaning.</p><p>\u201cStay down, Dupre,\u201d the coach said. \u201cWhat the hell happened?\u201d</p><p>But Landon kept struggling to get up, his arm flailing.</p><p>\u201cCoach.\u201d Downy grabbed the towel off the hook by the shower and tossed it at him. \u201cCover him up. He didn\u2019t pass out. He got jumped in the showers. Who did it, Landon?\u201d</p><p>Landon just groaned and reached a wet hand toward his face. His jaw was already starting to swell and his lip was bleeding. He could feel the goose egg rising on his forehead.</p><p>Downy crouched. \u201cTell me before the EMTs and cops get here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCops?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLandon, this asshole is not getting away with this,\u201d Downy said. \u201cWas it Morrison?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMorrison?\u201d the coach asked, clearly astonished.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a prick, Coach,\u201d Downy said. \u201cI\u2019ve been watching him knock kids around since the fourth grade. He gave my little brother some trouble until I stepped in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMorrison?\u201d the coach asked again. \u201cI never saw that in him!\u201d</p><p>Downy looked at him. \u201cOf course you didn\u2019t,\u201d Downy said. \u201cTrust me. Was it Morrison?\u201d he asked Landon again.</p><p>And Landon nodded weakly. His vision had cleared and he was thinking straight, though he had one hell of a headache. He could pretend that a powerful whack on the head caused him to weaken in front of the coach and Downy, spilling Morrison\u2019s name. But that wasn\u2019t it at all. He\u2019d had enough. So, the guy had been doing this to anyone he perceived weaker since he was a little kid? Big surprise. Time for him to be stopped.</p><p>\u201cIt was Morrison,\u201d Landon said. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t the first time. He had his boys hold me so he could punch me out once. And he ordered me to throw a game so I\u2019d look bad and he could play. Said it was his team. His school.\u201d</p><p>The coach\u2019s eyes grew narrow and steely. News about a less-than-loyal player got to him the worst. Downy stood slowly, went into the locker room and grabbed a stack of towels. He propped one under Landon\u2019s head and used a few more to cover his shivering body. \u201cStay calm. They\u2019ll be here pretty quick and they have blankets. Who do we call for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy sister. Sarah. She\u2019s in my phone. My locker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to be okay, Dupre,\u201d the coach said. \u201cYou seeing double or anything?\u201d Landon shook his head. \u201cThat\u2019s a good sign. You have to stay down. In case there\u2019s something wrong with your back.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with my back, but I bit the hell out of my tongue. Do I have all my teeth? Because my words don\u2019t sound right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooks like it. Salsa-free diet for a week or so, though. I\u2019m going to get an ice pack for that lump on your head.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAw, God,\u201d Landon said with a shiver. \u201cIce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make this right, Dupre,\u201d the coach said. \u201cYou should\u2019ve just told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat for?\u201d Landon asked. \u201cYou still can\u2019t believe it. You only believe it because Downy told you.\u201d</p><p>He was quiet for a minute before he said, \u201cAll that just changed, son.\u201d</p><p>Nine</p> <p>When the call came that a deputy was needed at the school, Mac was already there\u2014not working, waiting for Lou and his kids. Lou was helping a couple of teachers chaperone the students decorating in the gym, and his two younger kids refused to go home until they saw what Eve and her friends were doing. So there he was, standing around in the gym, talking to a couple of the parents, when he caught the call on his phone.</p><p>The deputy on duty was needed to respond to an assault in the men\u2019s locker room.</p><p>In the locker room? Assault?</p><p>By the time Mac handed the kids over to Lou and walked across the gym floor to the locker room, the EMTs were headed through the locker room\u2019s back door from the parking lot with their bags. Steve Pritkus\u2014the deputy on duty\u2014was right behind them. He met them right outside the showers.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take the medical techs long to ensure Landon was stable and get him on a gurney. Even though he\u2019d already moved his spine, they insisted on a backboard, which they promised would go away as soon as X-rays were taken and a doctor had a look. While they trussed him up and covered him, the deputies had a chat with Coach Rayborough and Crawford Downy. Their stories matched up. By the time Landon was ready to transport, Mac and Deputy Pritkus had a chance to ask him a few questions. Then the EMTs took him out through the locker room\u2019s back door, which led to the parking lot. It was through that door that the team ran to the field.</p><p>Just as the ambulance was ready to get under way, Sarah Dupre showed up. After the EMTs reassured her that her brother would be all right, she followed the ambulance to the hospital in Bandon. There were no lights or sirens, just a nice, safe transport.</p> <p>But Mac had a picture of the kid\u2019s swollen, bleeding face on his cell phone. And Landon Dupre\u2019s assurance that he\u2019d be pressing charges.</p><p>\u201cI think we start in the gym where a lot of the kids are,\u201d Mac said. \u201cMorrison\u2019s car is still in the lot. Everyone in town knows that white BMW.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got it, boss,\u201d Pritkus said. They\u2019d already asked the coach and Downy not to discuss the situation with parents or students. They went back into the gym through the school. A small crowd had gathered around the door to the locker room, surrounding Downy and the coach. Jag Morrison kept his distance, and appeared to be putting the moves on a girl. She was sitting on the bleachers while he stood in front of her, one long leg lifted up, foot on the bleacher next to her. He had a hand in a pocket while another one was gesturing as he talked, smiled, laughed, apparently not interested in the hubbub around the locker room.</p><p>It twisted in Mac\u2019s gut. He\u2019d never warmed to this kid but it always surprised him when he ran into a suspect so confident, so nonchalant. Could he have really just smashed in a guy\u2019s face, left him lying naked on the shower-room floor, and gone about the business of trying to get himself a date?</p><p>\u201cDad? Dad?\u201d Eve said, tugging at his sleeve. \u201cIs Landon okay? Did he get hurt in the game? Did he fall in the shower? Dad?\u201d</p><p>He looked down at her, his brow wrinkled. \u201cHe\u2019s going to be fine, honey. I have things to do right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened? Where is he? I want to go see him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey took him to Bandon, but he\u2019s fine. His sister went with him. They don\u2019t need a lot of kids swarming the hospital. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be checked over and released.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDad, Landon\u2019s my date for the dance. I want to see him! If Aunt Lou takes me, can I go? Please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell Lou I\u2019m passing the baton to her. And tell her I need her to keep an eye on Ryan and Dee Dee a bit longer, too. I have some work to do now.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes shot down the bleachers to Jag, then up to her father\u2019s face. She gasped. \u201cOh, God, Jag hurt him, didn\u2019t he. Landon said Jag was always on him, shoving him, slamming him up against the lockers!\u201d</p><p>Mac held her attention with his gaze. \u201cEve, I want you to go back to Lou and the kids. I\u2019m going to take Mr. Morrison for a ride. And I don\u2019t want you to talk about this with anyone yet. There\u2019s a legal process that has to happen.\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip, then nodded gravely. \u201cCan I go see Landon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tell Lou it\u2019s all up to her. I\u2019m going to be tied up for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJag Morrison,\u201d Mac said. \u201cI\u2019d like you to come with Deputy Pritkus and me, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he said, pulling his foot off the bleachers and straightening.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to walk outside to the patrol car,\u201d Mac said.</p><p>He laughed. \u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d he said, shaking his head. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to walk outside, where Deputy Pritkus is going to read you your rights and charge you with a crime. You can come along or we can put on the cuffs and escort you that way. If I were you, I\u2019d vote for nice and polite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrime? What the fuck? Crime?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAssault,\u201d Pritkus said. He pulled his cuffs off the back of his belt.</p><p>\u201cWhoa, whoa,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cHold on\u2014I wouldn\u2019t assault anyone! You\u2019re crazy! I\u2019m not going anywhere!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good, because I kind of like the idea of you in handcuffs,\u201d Mac said. \u201cThere\u2019s a young man on his way to the hospital in an ambulance, thanks to you. He lost consciousness for a while, but not his memory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way,\u201d he said, holding up his palms, backing away. \u201cThis is someone just trying to get me into trouble. Are there witnesses?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCuffs it is,\u201d Mac said.</p><p>With one deputy on each side, they wrestled his arms behind his back and into the cuffs. By the time it was accomplished, he was on his knees. The focus of the students had shifted away from the locker-room door to Jag\u2019s arrest. Mac and Pritkus hoisted him up, dragged him outside. Right before putting him into the back of the deputy\u2019s cruiser, he was read his rights.</p><p>\u201cI want my parents! I want my mother!\u201d Morrison yelled as they shoved him in the backseat.</p><p>They let him sit there, yelling and rocking the car, while Mac used his cell to call another deputy. He didn\u2019t want to leave the town uncovered while Pritkus drove Morrison over to the jail in Coquille. And Mac wanted to make sure he was processed.</p><p>\u201cWe could probably get away with taking him to the Thunder Point office,\u201d Mac said. \u201cHe\u2019s going to be released to his parents\u2019 custody anyway. But I just watched a kid get put in an ambulance. I want Morrison to at least see the inside of a jail. With any luck, there are some scary sons of bitches in the jail tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI vote for Coquille,\u201d Pritkus said. \u201cTry Charlie Adams. He\u2019s probably looking for a little call-out overtime. He never says no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou read my mind, Pritkus. Meanwhile, I\u2019m going to go visit the Morrisons.\u201d</p><p>When Coach Rayborough called Sarah Dupre, she jumped in her car, racing to the high school to find EMTs pulling a gurney toward an ambulance that was parked behind the school. For a search-and-rescue pilot who\u2019d seen more than her fair share of injuries, sometimes the worst kind, her cool was long gone, even before she laid eyes on Landon. This was her little brother, her only family!</p><p>She rushed to him, asking the EMTs if he was going to be all right. They said they thought so, but the verdict rested with the doctor. He had briefly lost consciousness. But he was now alert and his pupils were equal.</p><p>\u201cLandon, who did this to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe deputy\u2019s on it, Sarah. I told him. Some punk ball player who\u2019s probably just jealous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould I ride in the ambulance with you?\u201d She directed her gaze at one of the EMTs.</p><p>\u201cIf you follow us to Bandon, you\u2019ll have your car to take him home after he\u2019s treated and released,\u201d the young man said.</p><p>She drove behind the ambulance, taking small comfort in the fact that they weren\u2019t running lights and siren. Then, once they cleared town, the ambulance lit up. They didn\u2019t drive real fast, but they rolled code. Sarah knew what was happening\u2014they were lit up so other motorists would be aware that they were loaded. She knew Landon hadn\u2019t had a heart attack or brain seizure. All the same, her chest constricted and she gripped her steering wheel with all her might. She followed closer than was allowed by law and she didn\u2019t care. She was just plain scared to death.</p><p>Feelings of helplessness weren\u2019t alien to Sarah. Her parents died when she was twenty-three and in helicopter flight school; Landon had been five. Aunt Frances had taken him in and Sarah visited him on the weekends she was able to get away from training. But it was torture; Frances pronounced him bad and undisciplined, while the tales of cruelty Landon reported chilled her to the bone. Then he started running away. He didn\u2019t get far, but still...</p><p>She had to ask for a leave from training, hire a lawyer, get custody of her brother, even though she had no idea how she\u2019d take care of him and serve in the Coast Guard. Her commander worked with her, put her in the next training class after she\u2019d had time to figure out how to be a single mother. It could have been compassionate; it could have been the USCG worried about some discrimination complaint. She preferred to go with compassionate.</p><p>But damn! Life was crazy in those days. She was trying to get through helicopter training, which was so much harder than fixed wing, grieve her parents, try to get her little brother through his grief and fear\u2014all at the same time. She grew thin and tired. So tired.</p><p>But she made it through that obstacle. Then on to Kodiak, Alaska, flying rescues out of the Bering Sea\u2014which turned her into a damn fine pilot, because the challenge was steep. Luckily, her fellow pilots were dedicated to helping her learn and grow professionally. Then Michigan, then Florida\u2014where she fell in love with Derek Stiles.</p><p>Suddenly, she thought she had a family again. Derek was so loving and so devoted to Landon. There was someone to share responsibility for a change. For the first time since becoming Landon\u2019s guardian, she dreamed of a softer, better life for them both...even though a little voice inside her warned her to be cautious. They married a year later. Then on to North Bend, Oregon\u2014first Sarah and then Derek.</p><p>That\u2019s where the marriage ended. A marriage that should never have begun. He\u2019d been unfaithful from the beginning. And at a place deep inside her, she\u2019d known it.</p><p>I\u2019m sorry, Sarah, I really love you. I guess I\u2019m not cut out to be monogamous.</p><p>But my friend?</p><p>I\u2019m sorry. I had a thing with Susan. It didn\u2019t make sense, but it was there.</p><p>She\u2019d known. There had been red flags everywhere, but she\u2019d forced them from her mind because she loved him, depended on him. Landon had become like a stepson to Derek. She relied on Derek to look after him, to go to his games when she couldn\u2019t. And Landon relied on Derek to be the man in his life. But she had to end it, because Derek was never going to belong to her, to them. Just like any mother, she had to try to deal with the fact that Derek had let Landon down, as well. But ironically, it was Landon who said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to stay with him, Sarah. Not for me, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d</p><p>Her career and her brother were all she had, and for their sake Sarah pulled herself together. She and Derek decided they could be civilized. They\u2019d try to work separate schedules in North Bend when possible, but if they were thrown together, they\u2019d be grown-ups about it. Sarah refused to let it show on the job that her heart had been ripped out. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>But she was helpless and alone again and the pain of it was horrible. So she looked into finding the best community, the friendliest, with the most proactive football coach for Landon, and they moved to Thunder Point.</p><p>She thought she\u2019d brought them both to a kinder, safer, more manageable place. But now she felt that helplessness again. Here he was, in the ambulance ahead of her. If she understood the coach, he\u2019d been jumped in the shower, left naked and unconscious on the cold, tile floor.</p> <p>She was intercepted in the E.R. by an admissions nurse. \u201cA physician\u2019s assistant is examining your son\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrother,\u201d she corrected. \u201cBut I have custody. Our parents are deceased.\u201d She dug around in her purse. \u201cHere are my insurance cards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to have you get to work on admission paperwork,\u201d the nurse said. \u201cSince he came in on a backboard, I think he\u2019ll be lined up for X-rays right away so spinal injury can be ruled out. That takes a while. Then you can see him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she said. Her hand shook as she accepted the clipboard and pen. She sat down, rather than standing there at the counter, so the nurse wouldn\u2019t see her tremble.</p><p>They kept Landon in X-ray a long time. She longed to step outside and call someone, but there was no one. In moving to Thunder Point in early August, she\u2019d isolated herself. Oh, there was Gina, but they were just casual friends and she didn\u2019t have her number. There were football and PTA parents, but none of them were people she\u2019d call with tears in her voice. For that matter, she wasn\u2019t sure who Landon\u2019s friends were. She saw his teammates high-five and fist bump him, but there hadn\u2019t been any friends at the house and he didn\u2019t go out much.</p> <p>Finally she was allowed in the E.R. exam room. There she found Landon sitting up, free of the backboard, talking on the phone while holding the ice pack to the other side of his face. \u201cYeah, I told the deputy and I said I\u2019d press charges, so that\u2019s done.\u201d Then he laughed and said, \u201cOh, I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s good or not. It might\u2019ve just bought me more trouble. Hey, my sister\u2019s here to take me home, so I gotta go. Just wanted you to know...it\u2019s all good. I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>He clicked off and looked at Sarah.</p><p>\u201cWho was that?\u201d she asked. Who do you check in with after you\u2019ve been beat up?</p><p>\u201cThat guy I told you about\u2014Cooper. The one who has Ben\u2019s place now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh? And how old is this Cooper person?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said with a shrug. \u201cOld.\u201d Then he grinned and winced. \u201cA little older than you, I think. He\u2019s friends with the deputy. He took me out for a hamburger after the Carver game.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me that,\u201d she said. She had gone to that game. She\u2019d been available if he\u2019d wanted a hamburger. \u201cJust where did you meet this Cooper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the beach, Sarah. I was running Ham and he was at the bait shop. I stopped to ask him what was going on there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now you\u2019re calling him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s friends with the deputy!\u201d Landon stressed. \u201cI didn\u2019t want him to hear about this and go looking for me to see if I\u2019m all right! Jesus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt just sounds very suspicious,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYeah? Well, Cooper didn\u2019t jump me in the shower and bash my face in.\u201d He pulled the ice pack away from his purple cheek and black eye and she closed her eyes and just shuddered. \u201cA senior by the name of Jag Morrison did this. And he\u2019s been threatening me since school started. He was the star quarterback\u2014you should use the term loosely. He can\u2019t throw a pass to save his life, but he was the best they had. He does not like having a junior from out of town slip into his position.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long has this been going on?\u201d she asked, scowling. \u201cI\u2019ve met the Morrisons. I sat with them at a game once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince about the third or fourth practice. I\u2019ve been holding him off.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, jeez, Sarah, twenty reasons. How about we start with I don\u2019t want my sister talking to the principal or the guy\u2019s parents. I don\u2019t want to hide behind your skirt. And...you\u2019ve been going through your own shit lately. Since we got rid of Derek, you haven\u2019t been exactly...strong. You haven\u2019t been strong\u2014there, it\u2019s been said. I didn\u2019t want to put one more thing on you\u2014especially if I could handle it.\u201d</p><p>She pulled the ice pack away from his face. \u201cHow about next time you tell me and save your face,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>\u201cYeah, right. It\u2019s too late to save my face now. And I even have a date for the dance. I guess she won\u2019t want to go now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA date? Who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEve McCain. The deputy\u2019s daughter. She asked me.\u201d Then he grinned and said, \u201cOw.\u201d He pressed the ice back against the right side of his face.</p><p>She shook her head and tried not to laugh. \u201cWe have communication issues,\u201d she pointed out.</p><p>\u201cYou have communication issues,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re going through the divorce blues and, hey, I get that. I\u2019m kind of going through them, too. Not only did I have to change schools, but that prick didn\u2019t even ask for joint custody or visitation! How do you think that makes me feel?\u201d</p><p>A soft smile came across her face. \u201cI let you swear too much,\u201d she said, secretly admitting it gave her enormous pleasure to hear him call Derek a prick. Most of the time she felt just inches from losing it. Landon\u2019s anger sat very well with her. Maybe they should take one evening a week to sit around cursing him, saying every mean and evil thing they could think of. The bastard\u2014breaking their hearts like that.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look now, Sarah, but I think it\u2019s too late. At least I know when not to say those things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have to talk more, Landon,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cSarah, you\u2019re the one who hasn\u2019t been talking. When you get more over Derek, we\u2019ll talk more. Look, it\u2019s okay. You\u2019ll get over him. Only a real mean fucker would start dating before the marriage even gets started, so cut yourself some slack.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes welled with tears she wouldn\u2019t let fall. She had been forced to be strong on so many levels\u2014her family history, her job, taking custody of a young boy. And all with so few tools at her disposal. When something hit her\u2014like Derek\u2019s cheating\u2014she withdrew into herself. Not good. Not good at all.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d the doctor said, pulling aside the drape and coming into the exam area. \u201cWe\u2019re not seeing any reason to admit you, but I want you and your sister to be on the lookout for symptoms of concussion. The nurse will give you a list of instructions. I know the P.A. asked, but I\u2019d like to hear the answer. Did you get hit in the game?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m too fast for \u2019em. I guess I need to get a little faster in the shower.\u201d Then he tried his handsome grin again, and again he said, \u201cOw.\u201d</p><p>The doctor chuckled.</p><p>\u201cI can sit up with him tonight, if that\u2019s necessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s required, Mrs....ah,\u201d he looked down. \u201cDupre.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeet Lt. Commander Sarah Dupre, my big sister,\u201d Landon said. \u201cMy keeper. My ball and chain. Coast Guard Search and Rescue. And she\u2019s single.\u201d</p><p>He laughed again. \u201cPleasure,\u201d he said, sticking out his hand toward her. \u201cI\u2019m married, but it\u2019s still a pleasure. And we thank you for all the help you give us here, on the coast and wherever you\u2019re needed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a shame, you being married,\u201d Landon said. \u201cMy sister hasn\u2019t been out in a while and you can\u2019t imagine how that impacts my social life.\u201d</p><p>The emotional strain of having Landon hurt left Sarah exhausted. She was afraid she might sleep too soundly to check on him during the night and considered setting the alarm on her cell phone, just to be sure she woke up at least every hour. That turned out to be completely unnecessary\u2014she spent the night on the couch, where she barely dozed.</p><p>It brought to mind those days right after she had rescued him from Aunt Frances. He didn\u2019t talk about his experience, but he was so shaken she slept with him every night, holding him close and safe. He never complained, but sometimes he cried in his sleep, his little body trembling in her arms.</p><p>Now he was almost a man and she was running out of ways to keep him safe.</p><p>She crept into his room at regular intervals, nearly tripping over Ham, although she couldn\u2019t imagine what good it did. How do you hold off a concussion? But his face, beautiful even with bruises and swelling from having taken a beating, fed her soul. He was so childlike in sleep, a little boy in a man\u2019s body, at peace and trusting.</p><p>Her. Trusting her.</p><p>He had been her priority for ten years. She\u2019d always found a way to put him first and had been fortunate enough to get support from other Coast Guard families and her commanders. But lately? It wasn\u2019t so much the divorce as it was Derek who had kept her completely off-balance. She had failed Landon. He\u2019d been thrown into a new school, put on a new team, bullied and picked on without her being even slightly aware, struck up a friendship with some middle-aged man she knew nothing about...</p><p>She was going to have to talk to him about that. But first, she had to get some sleep.</p><p>Morning came with the crunching sounds of Ham and Landon having breakfast. She pried open one eye. Landon sat at the kitchen table, shoveling cornflakes into his mouth while Ham was nose into the big bowl by the back door devouring dog food. She sat up, rubbed her eyes and looked at her brother.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make you a couple of eggs,\u201d she said.</p><p>Landon let the spoon rest in the bowl. \u201cSarah, you slept on the couch in your clothes. You don\u2019t have to make me an egg. If I\u2019d wanted an egg, I would\u2019ve made one. I have a black eye, not a broken arm. I did make you some coffee, however.\u201d</p><p>She moved to the table. \u201cThank God. I\u2019m exhausted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too. I woke up about once an hour. Someone was prowling around my bedroom.\u201d</p><p>She leaned on her hand. \u201cYou could\u2019ve said something....\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd ruin your fun?\u201d He got up and poured her a cup of coffee. \u201cI\u2019m going back to bed, though. And I\u2019m locking my door.\u201d</p><p>She accepted the cup, blowing on it and taking a sip. \u201cThe purple is coming out,\u201d she said, gesturing with her cup to his face. \u201cI mean coming out even more. I think you got a bruise on your bruise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Landon. This is my fault. I wasn\u2019t paying attention. I had no idea you were fighting this problem. I was so caught up in my own....\u201d</p><p>Again the spoon rested in the bowl. \u201cSarah, I didn\u2019t want you to know. I didn\u2019t want anyone to know. I wanted to be able to take care of it myself. It wasn\u2019t until I heard Crawford Downy telling the coach that Morrison has been kicking kids around since fourth grade that I decided the best way to take care of it was to out him. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ll get this, but there\u2019s a big difference between tattling to the coach or the teacher and just taking him on, publicly. It\u2019s the difference between a billboard and a whisper. Morrison snuck up on me in the shower. He was handcuffed and taken away. I can\u2019t see how he\u2019s going to get out of this one.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cUp until he did that, he was nothing but sneaky shoves and bragging and badgering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you talked to that guy, that Cooper...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly,\u201d Landon said. \u201cI was out on the beach with Ham, throwing the ball for him, and Morrison and some of his leeches were there, paddleboarding and stuff. They were giving me a little trouble. Not letting me pass. Ham the fearless was hiding behind me. Cooper was out on the deck at Ben\u2019s. He gave a whistle. That\u2019s all. Just to say he was watching. And of course that chickenshit Morrison pulled off the posse. I walked down the beach, ended up at the dock. I just talked to him for a while, that\u2019s all. It was like he knew what was going on before I had to explain anything. He said he\u2019d moved around a lot\u2014he\u2019d been the new guy a lot.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s all right, Sarah. Stop worrying about Cooper.\u201d</p> <p>How would Landon know that? Cooper could be a very manipulative con artist or pedophile. But she knew better than to pretend to be the all-wise big sister. That was usually the kiss of death. So she said, \u201cSure. Right.\u201d</p><p>When Landon went back to bed, she pulled on her rubber boots and red jacket. Ham started wiggling around and snuffling. \u201cShh,\u201d she said. \u201cJust get your ball!\u201d She hurried to get him out of the house before he woke Landon.</p><p>It was a cold, sunny morning but Sarah\u2019s mood was stormy. She wasn\u2019t really processing all the events of the past few months\u2014the divorce, the tension she\u2019d felt working with Derek, the move, the attack on Landon. Crisis was somehow easier to manage than that old impotence of not being in control, not being able to resolve things.</p><p>She jogged across the beach, throwing the ball for Hamlet. She didn\u2019t really have a plan until she\u2019d run all the way up the beach stairs to the bait shop, Ham on her heels, and went around the building to the trailer. She knew she might be acting a little irrationally, but she banged on the door. Then she banged on the door again, harder. She could hear him inside, walking. Finally he jerked the door open, wearing only a towel, with shaving cream on half his face, an impressive tattoo covering his right shoulder and running down his biceps. She demanded, \u201cWhat the hell is going on with you and my brother?\u201d</p><p>He frowned at her. \u201cAnd this must be Sarah,\u201d he said calmly. \u201cWould you like to come inside?\u201d</p> <p>She stepped back. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just come outside?\u201d she asked, knowing it was a ridiculous request.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m much better at conversation with my pants on,\u201d he said. \u201cStand by.\u201d He let the door drift closed and was back a moment later with a small towel. \u201cWipe Ham\u2019s mouth and feet and come inside. I\u2019ll put on some clothes, we\u2019ll talk about whatever has you upset and then maybe I\u2019ll get back to my shower. That work for you?\u201d</p><p>Inexplicably, she hated him for being calm. She felt more out of control than ever, yet more determined to be the stronger one. She snatched the towel out of his hand and said, \u201cGet your pants.\u201d</p><p>Cooper gave Sarah Dupre a brief salute. He walked past his galley kitchen and up three steps to his bathroom and bedroom. He closed the door. He leaned on the bathroom counter, looked in the mirror at his half-shaved face and whispered, \u201cHoly crap.\u201d Hot damn! He checked\u2014his tongue was not hanging out but his eyes were a little hot. She was a freaking knockout.</p><p>Her hair was short, thick and dark and framed her face in a sexy, provocative way. Her eyes were so big, so chocolate, surrounded by thick, black lashes. Her lips\u2014oh, my God, those lips. Ruby, full, heart-shaped lips that just begged to be... Stop, he told himself. She hid her small body under that thigh-length red jacket with a hood and a loose white shirt beneath that, but he could see a shapely form inside. He blinked his eyes closed hard, then checked to see if he was drooling.</p><p>Landon hadn\u2019t told him how stunning she was. But then again, how many teenage boys brag about how pretty their sisters are?</p> <p>It didn\u2019t take a genius to figure out that she had her wind up about his friendship with Landon. Now, this was a first. He\u2019d faced off with protective fathers over daughters and even had a very uncomfortable run-in with an ex-husband. There had been an occasion or two when a woman couldn\u2019t decide between Cooper and another guy... But this? A beautiful woman who almost brought him to his knees, angry and upset over his friendship with her little brother? Whoa. He had an urge to call his older sister, Rochelle, and ask her what was happening here. She was no expert, but she was never short on advice.</p><p>He pulled on jeans and a white undershirt. He found her sitting in the same chair Landon had last occupied. She sprang to her feet. \u201cSit down,\u201d he said gently. Then he went to the kitchen, filled the saucepan for Ham, grabbed another towel to put under it because the dog was a sloppy and ferocious drinker, and set him up. \u201cWe have our routine,\u201d he said casually.</p><p>\u201cHow many times have you had this routine?\u201d she wanted to know.</p><p>\u201cOnce.\u201d</p><p>While Ham was lapping, Cooper took the couch. \u201cNow, what has you so angry?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not angry. I just want to know what this relationship with my brother is about. I have questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he said, leaning forward on the couch, elbows on his knees, hands clasped together. \u201cI saw Landon get into a little altercation on the beach. Nothing big or scary. Some kid was giving him crap and shoved him. I talked to him after that, found out he was getting bullied. Ostracized by some of his teammates. You know why, right?\u201d</p><p>She just shook her head.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s a better ball player than the senior, the team captain. I went to a game a week or so ago, just by accident\u2014I was looking for food but the whole town was at the high school, at the game, so I went. I ran into a few people I knew\u2014the McCains and their friends. It was amazing. Landon\u2019s damn good. When I was leaving, I overheard a scuffle and found that same kid from the beach and some of his friends ganging up on Landon. He didn\u2019t get hurt or anything, but I did have a talk with him and suggested he tell you or the coach or the deputy. That bully thing, that\u2019s just all wrong. You never know where that\u2019s going to stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the locker-room shower?\u201d she asked, lifting one brow.</p><p>He ran a hand over his head. \u201cYeah, I should\u2019ve done something. It\u2019s a hard call. Sixteen-year-old boys, they have their pride. It\u2019s not like Landon\u2019s getting knocked around because he\u2019s the little guy or the nerdy guy. He said he could handle it and I thought he probably could. He\u2019s a big guy, Landon. Tough. But I apologize. I should\u2019ve gone over his head.\u201d</p><p>She looked around the trailer. \u201cBut why are you here?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhat are you doing here, interceding for my brother? Do you work? What do you do?\u201d</p><p>He gave her a second to catch her breath. What did she think? That he was some perv trolling for young men out of a trailer? \u201cI\u2019m between jobs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d she asked with an accusatory tone.</p><p>\u201cIt is so,\u201d he said. \u201cBen and I were friends. We were going to meet in the mountains, go hunting. He died suddenly. Instead of looking for work, I came up here to find out what happened to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe fell down the stairs, mysterious circumstances,\u201d she informed him. \u201cAnd the idea of Landon hanging around here after that? I don\u2019t love that idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess I don\u2019t blame you. If it\u2019s any comfort, Deputy McCain and I have a pretty tight watch on the place. But nothing more mysterious than my friend tripping has materialized. I think, Sarah, it was probably just a sad accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet you\u2019re still here. Living in a trailer.\u201d</p><p>He laughed at her suddenly. She was ferocious, and amazingly beautiful as she played the lioness. \u201cListen, Sarah, wanna lighten up? I live in the trailer because I can\u2019t live in Ben\u2019s place. It\u2019s a disaster. I\u2019m trying to clean it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you\u2019re a little insulting. I lived in this trailer for two years in Corpus Christi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoing what?\u201d</p><p>He leaned toward her. \u201cFlying helicopter transport to offshore oil rigs in the Gulf for an oil company. Not rescue, transport. I\u2019ve been flying helicopters since the Army. Fifteen years. I\u2019ll probably fly again, but not offshore. Something else.\u201d He loved the shocked look on her face. \u201cAfter Ben\u2019s death, plans changed. Right now, what I have to do is put this place right and settle Ben\u2019s business. He had no family left. It\u2019s going to take a few months. So I have a legitimate reason for being here. I\u2019m not parked here to sell teenagers drugs or do any other disreputable or unlawful business. I asked Landon for his cell phone number and gave him mine in case...I don\u2019t know, in case he needed someone\u2019s help. He told me you were sitting alert for the Coast Guard and sometimes he was on his own.\u201d He looked at her. \u201cI was just being a good neighbor. Your brother, he\u2019s a decent kid. And he\u2019s proud of you. He cares about you. He said you\u2019ve been through a lot lately.\u201d</p><p>She stood. \u201cHmm. Yes. Well, that\u2019s none of your concern.\u201d</p><p>Cooper also stood. \u201cI\u2019m not concerned, Sarah. I\u2019m what used to be called supportive. And you\u2019re a really tough broad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me a broad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me a reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, Mr....\u201d</p><p>\u201cCooper. Hank Cooper, but hardly anyone calls me Hank. Just Cooper.\u201d</p><p>But she was apparently bent on some formality, probably as a way to keep a distance between them. \u201cMr. Cooper, I\u2019m responsible for Landon. Just me. It can be a challenge, given my job. But I just want to protect him.\u201d</p><p>Cooper shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have a problem with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh? And why is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I think he wants to protect you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s sixteen!\u201d</p><p>Cooper gave a nod. \u201cA very smart, strong and brave sixteen with some real high standards. He must have had a good role model.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s had no role model. Our father died when Landon was five, and my ex-husband is a jackass who abandoned him!\u201d</p><p>Cooper put his hands in the back pockets of his jeans and rocked on his heels. He gave her a small smile. \u201cIt didn\u2019t have to be a male role model, Sarah.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth actually dropped open slightly. It appeared to take her a moment to absorb this. He could almost see the wheels turning. A compliment from the bad man in the trailer?</p><p>She closed her mouth. She stood a little taller. \u201cListen, Mr. Cooper, I\u2019m going to be watching you and if you do anything to hurt my brother, you\u2019re going to pay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnderstood,\u201d he said, but he couldn\u2019t wipe the smile off his face.</p><p>\u201cHam!\u201d she ordered, going for the door. But the dog was way ahead of her and she almost fell over him. She jumped out of the trailer, stumbled over the dog and headed for the beach.</p><p>Cooper watched her go. He whistled. \u201cWhew. Tough broad.\u201d</p><p>Ten</p><p>Cooper dusted off his suit. Well, it was his suit now. Rochelle\u2019s husband, Dave, wore suits to work every day, but a year or so ago, he\u2019d been bitten by the chips-and-beer fairy, growing out of a few of his expensive suits. Of course Rochelle tried to put him on a diet, which was semi-successful, but the tight suits went away. So did the tight and oh-so-expensive Italian dress shirts. Up to that point, Cooper had one fairly late model sports coat and some nice slacks. He did have occasional dates and a wedding or funeral every couple of years.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t big on suits. Yet, he looked in the mirror and couldn\u2019t help but be impressed. He wondered if he\u2019d survive in a desk job.</p><p>No. He wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>The school gymnasium had been transformed for the dance and was full of kids, at least a couple hundred. It was also pretty flush with adults. Cooper was about the best-dressed one there, thanks to his beefy brother-in-law. Since Mac was tall, he was the first one Cooper picked out of the crowd. He got around to Mac\u2019s side by skirting a wall decorated in crepe paper. Mac was close to the refreshment table and, after shaking Cooper\u2019s hand, he passed a plastic cup toward him. \u201cPunch?\u201d</p><p>Cooper looked into the cup. \u201cIt\u2019s pink,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI know. Wait till you taste it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much of that crap do you have to drink before you can go home?\u201d</p><p>Mac chuckled. \u201cMy job is to make sure nothing adult gets poured into the punch bowl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an amateur,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cWith all these chaperones around the punch bowl, they\u2019ll pour it right into their cups.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cRight, but I\u2019ve got Gina and Lou in the crowd. They both have eyes in the back of their heads. How\u2019d you get talked into this?\u201d</p><p>Cooper gave a snort and shook his head. He spread his jacket and put his hands in his pockets. \u201cBy now you\u2019ve probably figured out, Landon\u2019s the kid I was keeping an eye on. When Gina asked me\u2014no, make that ordered me\u2014to join the chaperone crew, I thought maybe it wasn\u2019t a bad idea. It\u2019s not like I have a lot of social commitments around here and I\u2019m getting a little tired of mold.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou should\u2019ve told me about Landon,\u201d Mac said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. I guess I should\u2019ve. So, by now there\u2019s probably no real reason for me to be here. Is he here? Landon?\u201d</p><p>Mac gave a nod. \u201cDancing with my daughter. As I watch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry to go easy, Mac. You were sixteen once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m watching.\u201d</p> <p>Cooper laughed. \u201cSo, I know Landon went to the hospital to be checked out, but he\u2019s okay except for a black eye. What about the other kid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe went to jail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d Cooper asked, shocked.</p><p>\u201cYou act surprised. Landon was jumped from behind, but he saw his assailant and named him. He\u2019s filing charges, thank God. You know, I don\u2019t usually get a big kick out of arresting people. Hooking \u2019em up and taking them to jail. But that one,\u201d he said. \u201cI kind of enjoyed that. Little bastard. Fighting is bad enough, dirty fighting is just cheap and nasty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMorrison isn\u2019t here tonight, is he?\u201d Cooper asked.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been suspended from school. There will be some straightening out to do before he shows up again. And it isn\u2019t official, but I think he\u2019s all done playing football. There are only three games left, but if I know the coach, he\u2019s finished, even when he gets back into school.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, before you write this one off, be sure to ask Landon about Morrison\u2019s friends. He has a posse, don\u2019t ask me why. Right after the Carver game, I just happened upon a little scuffle. Two big boys were holding Landon so Morrison could hit him.\u201d</p><p>Mac scrubbed a hand down his face. \u201cAw, man...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know their names, but I could pick them out. It would be better, though, if Landon just told you. Is there likely to be any trouble from them tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoubtful,\u201d Mac said. \u201cThat Eve, she\u2019s her father\u2019s daughter, all right. Once she found out Morrison was giving Landon a hard time, she fixed them up with a double date. Ashley\u2019s boyfriend is an alumnus, very large, very well liked around here. I\u2019ll give Landon a call tomorrow, see if we can wrap this up. Any other little gems you were saving?\u201d</p><p>Cooper missed some of the question. Out of the corner of his eye he caught sight of a woman he recognized. Sarah was here. She seemed to be staying close to the gym doors, half-hidden by a fake pillar with crepe paper and balloons attached to it.</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d he said to Mac.</p><p>\u201cI said, is there anything else I should know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t think of a thing, Mac. Hey, I think I\u2019ve learned my lesson here. If I\u2019d told you what was going on, maybe Landon would be a little pissed, but he probably wouldn\u2019t have gotten hurt.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd there you go,\u201d Mac said.</p><p>\u201cUm, I see someone I should say hello to,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cLandon\u2019s sister is here. Guard that punch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know it.\u201d</p><p>Cooper swung by the refreshment table, got a little plastic cup of that pink shit, a small napkin and walked toward Sarah. She was peering around the fake pillar and had her back to him as he approached on her other side\u2014and what a back it was. She was wearing a long-sleeved, formfitting black sweater-type dress with some kind of animal skin belt and black, high-heeled boots. Although Cooper would have no way of knowing, he suspected she didn\u2019t buy those boots in Thunder Point.</p><p>\u201cAre you hiding?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She jumped and whirled around, her hand pressed to her throat. She let her eyes close briefly. \u201cYou scared me to death!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he said. \u201cYou seemed to be peeking out from around the decorations. Are you incognito tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a little on the low-profile side.\u201d She took a breath. \u201cIt\u2019s been a very long day.\u201d</p><p>He offered her the cup. \u201cPunch?\u201d</p><p>She looked at it and made a face. \u201cIt\u2019s pink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd no little umbrella, either. We have more in common than you\u2019d think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, about this morning...\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget it,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s your brother. He got hurt. You were worried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, thanks, but I wasn\u2019t exactly asking for forgiveness.\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows shot up. Figured.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that, I had no right to be so hostile. That came out of nowhere. It wasn\u2019t worry. When I don\u2019t have control of the situation...ack,\u201d she said, rubbing her temples with her fingers. \u201cOkay, I apologize for being so mean, but not for being suspicious of you. Any mother or older sister or guardian would be. Anyway, let\u2019s start fresh. Look at you\u2014you do not look like an ordinary helicopter pilot who\u2019s fixing up a run-down bait shop. That\u2019s a four-thousand-dollar suit. None of the helicopter pilots I know wear four-thousand-dollar suits. They don\u2019t even want to.\u201d</p><p>Cooper grinned. \u201cAnd this is a hundred-and-fifty-dollar shirt. It\u2019s Italian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClotheshorse, eh? Or drug lord?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head and laughed. \u201cMy brother-in-law is an executive who got fat. My sister sent me three suits, a bunch of shirts and some bad ties that cost a fortune. Gina told me to dress up.\u201d</p><p>A short laugh escaped her and her face was briefly transformed. She was beautiful to start with, her skin flawless, her cheeks flushed pink and those dark-coffee eyes so hot. \u201cWell, you clean up all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, thank you, Sarah. So, Mac tells me Landon is here, dancing with his daughter.\u201d</p><p>The smile vanished and she groaned, dropping her chin.</p><p>\u201cI take it he\u2019s recovered?\u201d Cooper asked.</p><p>\u201cHe looks like hell. Black eye, split lip, bruised cheek and a big old lump on his head. He shouldn\u2019t be out tonight. We did not have an amicable day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut does he feel okay?\u201d Cooper asked.</p><p>\u201cHe feels like the luckiest kid in the world because the ravishing Eve McCain wanted to go to the dance with him even though his face looks like hamburger. But I wouldn\u2019t let him drive. I offered to drive him and he said he\u2019d throw himself in front of a train first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is ravishing,\u201d Cooper said with humor. \u201cAnd she\u2019s nice. But most important, her daddy is the law around here. He put the guy who hit Landon in jail.\u201d</p><p>That got her attention. \u201cJail? Does Landon know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m sure the kid\u2019s parents got him out pretty quick, but he did go to jail. That makes me feel better. He\u2019s a snotty little dick.\u201d</p><p>Again with the smile, larger this time. Sarah had been hanging out with Coast Guard pilots for probably ten years. Cooper was speaking her language. Salty. But dear God, she was beautiful when she smiled like that.</p><p>\u201cDoes Landon know you\u2019re here?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cAnd he\u2019s not very happy about it. I wasn\u2019t going to come tonight, but then... He likes that I go to the games, but this? He wants to be alone with his girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis girl\u2019s daddy\u2019s watching. And her daddy is\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, the law.\u201d She laughed again. \u201cDid you know the young girls call him Deputy Yummy Pants?\u201d</p><p>Cooper barked out a laugh so loud people turned toward him. She put a hand on his arm to shush him.</p><p>\u201cShh. I hear he doesn\u2019t warm to it,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd he\u2019s a big boy with a gun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be careful with that information.\u201d Cooper looked around. \u201cI think these people have things under control. I could buy you something to drink that\u2019s not pink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh...I don\u2019t think so....\u201d</p><p>\u201cDinner,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll throw in dinner. Or if you\u2019ve had dinner, I\u2019ll buy you a drink and dessert.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, you\u2019re taking this good-neighbor thing kind of far. It wouldn\u2019t be such a good idea. I mean, you\u2019re Landon\u2019s friend and I\u2019m watching you to see if I have to beat you up for any reason.\u201d</p><p>His lips twitched with a smile; getting beat up by her could be erotic. As hell. \u201cTake a chance. We can talk about the town. Or your brother. Or helicopters, if you don\u2019t get enough of that at work. I don\u2019t know about you, but this isn\u2019t what I feel like doing tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but there\u2019s Landon... I hate to get too far away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cText him. Tell him we\u2019re going to dinner and we\u2019ll be nearby if he needs anything.\u201d He smiled at her. \u201cLet\u2019s get out of here.\u201d</p><p>Cooper suggested they stay in town, for her peace of mind, even though there were some great restaurants within thirty minutes of Thunder Point. She appreciated that. And he wanted to go in one car. \u201cI\u2019d be more than happy to take my truck, but I think given that narrow skirt of yours, we should go in your car. If you don\u2019t mind bringing me back for my truck, that is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could just go in separate cars,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cNah. Come on, let\u2019s ride together. But first, shoot a text to Landon.\u201d</p><p>She took out her phone in the high school parking lot and her thumbs got busy on the letters. \u201cI hope he\u2019s not all cranky about me going out after all the arguing we did today about him going out.\u201d</p><p>Cooper laughed. \u201cHe\u2019s going to think I\u2019m doing him a favor.\u201d Then his voice lowered slightly. \u201cBut I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d she said. \u201cHe texted right back. Have fun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cLet\u2019s go. I\u2019ve only figured out a couple of things in this town, but one is that when the town is occupied with school events like games, Cliffhanger\u2019s is quiet.\u201d He grabbed her elbow and started to walk her around to the passenger side of a compact SUV. \u201cWant me to drive?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cMy car? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right then,\u201d he said, backtracking and holding the driver\u2019s door for her. When you spent a lot of your life in a flight suit and combat boots, doors didn\u2019t get opened for you a lot, so she slid in. He got in the passenger seat, moving it back as far as it would go.</p><p>When she was behind the wheel and they were under way, he said, \u201cGood old Landon. I went to exactly one high school dance. I mean, real high school dance, like with a girl. The nonformal kind I\u2019d hit with a couple of buddies, if I had a couple of buddies, and we\u2019d prowl around the outskirts, ogle the girls so we\u2019d have something to talk about later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how was the one you actually went to? With a girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t work out the way I thought it would,\u201d he said with a laugh. \u201cIt took so much courage to ask her that my expectations might\u2019ve been a little high. She had a terrible time. Somehow I couldn\u2019t do anything right. She was miserable. Now I can\u2019t even remember her name, which makes me hope she can\u2019t remember mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe remembers,\u201d Sarah said. \u201cDo you remember anything about her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlond hair and boobs,\u201d he answered.</p><p>\u201cI give you some credit for being honest, but not a lot. Of credit, that is. Did it ever occur to you that women don\u2019t really like being remembered for their hair color or their boobs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it does, now. And I\u2019m very sorry, Commander Dupre, but even though I don\u2019t read Psychology Today, I do know that humans are visual creatures. There has to be an initial visual attraction and then, once you get to know a person better, you can fully appreciate all their other fine qualities. If you never get to know their traits and talents, you remember hair and boobs.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cVery shallow,\u201d she said. But what sprang instantly to mind was his torso in a towel. The amazing tattoo, his broad shoulders, fantastic biceps, terrific pecs, perfect chest hair\u2014not too much, not too little\u2014and that narrow waist. Her reaction pissed her off. \u201cIt\u2019s Lieutenant Commander,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s any comfort, I\u2019ve come a long way since high school.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo you no longer think about hair and boobs?\u201d</p><p>She pulled into Cliffhanger\u2019s parking lot, which was not full. As she found a space and parked he said, \u201cI didn\u2019t say that.\u201d He went around to the driver\u2019s side to open her door, but she was already getting out, treating him to a beautiful shot of thigh as she did so.</p><p>Holding her elbow, he steered her into the restaurant. Right inside the door was the bar, where he\u2019d eaten last time he was there. Beyond the bar was a fancier dining room, tablecloths and everything. He lifted a hand to the bartender. \u201cHey, Cliff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Cooper. Funeral?\u201d</p><p>Cooper just laughed and kept steering her.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s get a corner table like that one over there, near the fireplace. Damn, it\u2019s cold,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been in the Gulf too long, I think. What\u2019s winter like around here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cColder,\u201d she said with a laugh. \u201cWe just moved here this summer from North Bend, right up the road. But I did three years in Kodiak, three in Michigan. This is nothing. You have no fireplace in that trailer of yours.\u201d</p><p>He maneuvered her toward a table in the corner, not far from the restaurant\u2019s hearth. Only a few tables in the whole place were occupied, all of them far enough away so that no conversations would be overheard. He helped her out of her long, black coat and folded it over a vacant chair. \u201cNo fireplace and it rocks in the wind. Even though there\u2019s been sun almost every day, the wind off the bay can get chilly. I\u2019ve been cold since the day I got here. I\u2019m going to have to buy some sealskin or something.\u201d</p><p>The second she sat down, the bartender was standing beside their table with menus. Cooper was shrugging out of his jacket, draping it over the back of the chair. \u201cBring me a beer, Cliff. This is Miss Dupre\u2014Sarah.\u201d Cliff gave a nod. \u201cSarah, what would you like to drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA Chardonnay will do the trick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDraft and Chardonnay,\u201d Cooper said. Then he sat down, his back to the room, and loosened his tie. He removed his cuff links, slid them into his shirt pocket and rolled up his sleeves to just under his elbows. He leaned those elbows on the table, looked at her with a half smile and said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry that it was some difficult business for your brother that introduced me to him, but I\u2019m glad it led to meeting you.\u201d</p> <p>It was that comment\u2014combined with the fact that the small tuft of hair peeking out of his opened collar and his muscled forearms were achingly sexy\u2014that caused her to say, \u201cI\u2019ve been divorced for nine months.\u201d</p><p>He lifted one brow. \u201cWanna talk about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot particularly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you brought it up because...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you have an idea that this chance meeting is going to lead to something, you\u2019d be mistaken.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cSarah, we\u2019re both over thirty. Hopefully, we\u2019ve overcome the idea that dinner means sex. Unless it\u2019s an exceptional dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll split the check,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. You pay for dinner. Believe me, you\u2019ll feel more in control that way.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou know, I can tell you think you\u2019re funny, not taking me seriously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019re wrong!\u201d he said. \u201cI think it would be a catastrophe to not take you too seriously. A disaster of unparalleled proportion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHilarious,\u201d she said.</p><p>Cliff put her wine in front of her first, then put the draft down.</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cLiquor. Thank God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you decided yet?\u201d Cliff asked.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have the grouper,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cSalad starters, please. Ranch for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOil and vinegar, on the side,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAnd make sure Lieutenant Commander Dupre gets the check.\u201d He winked at her, and Cliff ran for his life.</p><p>She took a sip of her wine. \u201cHow do you know I won\u2019t expect sex if I pay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, cheers,\u201d he said, lifting his draft. \u201cAlthough I\u2019d feel cheap and dirty the whole time, I can live with that.\u201d</p><p>Much as it galled her, she laughed at him. \u201cEver married?\u201d she asked. \u201cChildren?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo and no. I think I probably saved some poor woman a world of misery,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNo doubt. So, how much did Landon tell you about me? About us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a lot. He said he\u2019s moved around with you and the Coast Guard. And I know about Aunt Frances.\u201d</p><p>She looked down. Then met his eyes and saw warmth and sympathy there. \u201cOur darkest year,\u201d she admitted. \u201cOur parents died, I had to take a compassionate leave to settle things, which put me back to the next class. I put Landon with the bitch who has no name, then had to take leave a second time to get him out of there. That poor kid. He should be so screwed up, all he\u2019s been through, and he\u2019s incredible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Aunt Frances?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cOur parting was ugly. We don\u2019t keep in touch. Well, we were in touch through lawyers briefly\u2014she was my father\u2019s only sibling and she actually fought Landon and I for some of the insurance money left, since she had been named in the will to take Landon. That will was written when Landon was a baby and I was barely eighteen, not ready to take on a child. But that she would abuse him and then expect a payoff...! We settled, but we will not stay in touch.\u201d</p><p>He sat back and let out a breath. \u201cI was right. That woman is going to have a hard time staying out of hell. Maybe she\u2019s dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think she\u2019s too mean to die. You said you were the new kid a lot? Military roots?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cVery boring roots, really. Corporate moves. My dad is an accountant. He rose to CFO of a big company based in Tampa, and the company folded when I was thirteen. I have three sisters\u2014they were nine, fifteen and seventeen at the time. While he was looking for something permanent, something with growth potential, he worked as a consultant on some long-term contract jobs. We moved three times and landed in Albuquerque right at the start of my junior year. The folks rented a house and bought one in a different school district a year later. That gave me four schools in as many years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it was hard,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cIt was terrible. I can look back and say I learned a few things, but here I am, almost forty, and I haven\u2019t stayed in one place for long since. Because it\u2019s just me, I pull up stakes the second I don\u2019t like the way the wind is blowing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how\u2019s the wind blowing in this place?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a very strange wind,\u201d he said. \u201cNot because of Thunder Point\u2014it\u2019s not a bad place at all. For mysterious reasons known only to my deceased friend, Ben, I am responsible for his property. It\u2019s a disaster. It\u2019s been kind of hard to decide how to handle it. While the cleanup is getting done, the contractor\u2019s architect is measuring, drawing up final plans, and there you have it. A few months from now, it\u2019ll be a new bait shop, without the bait.\u201d</p><p>She made a confused face.</p><p>\u201cThat place really needs to be a bar and deli\u2014drinks and prepackaged food that doesn\u2019t have to be made on site. Low-maintenance, so it can be managed by one person. We\u2019ll reinforce, finish off the cellar, remodel and rebuild the dock. Hopefully someone will be able to see the potential....\u201d</p><p>He talked about lumber and studs and beams, but Sarah didn\u2019t hear.</p><p>Across the room a couple and their teenage son stood from a table, grabbed their coats and were about to leave. It was Mr. and Mrs. Morrison, with Jag. When they saw her, they stopped midway across the dining room. Sarah hadn\u2019t noticed them before, but she knew them from the games. Mrs. Morrison was a beautiful, painfully thin woman of about forty-five or so, with hair so blond it was almost white. Mr. Morrison was shorter and older than his wife and he wore a most miserable rug.</p><p>There was a staring contest going on. Sarah slowly stood and was vaguely aware of Cooper looking over his shoulder. Then he, too, fell silent.</p><p>Sarah and the Morrisons\u2019 gazes were locked on one another. Then Mrs. Morrison lifted her nose and began to walk away.</p><p>\u201cHave you nothing to say to me?\u201d Sarah said because she couldn\u2019t help herself. \u201cNothing at all?\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Morrison\u2019s head snapped around and she wore a sneer so angry that Sarah actually flinched.</p><p>\u201cAnd what would you have me say? That I\u2019m very unhappy about the way you contrived this entire event with the sole purpose of some kind of revenge on my son?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d she said, completely confused. \u201cRevenge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLandon fell in a slippery shower but saw a perfect opportunity to make Jag seem responsible. Obviously a jealous move, one that\u2019s caused a world of trouble!\u201d</p><p>Jag, who stood a few feet behind his parents, actually smiled.</p><p>\u201cEffie, just let it go. Our lawyer can handle this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLawyer?\u201d Cooper asked. Then a huff of unamused laughter escaped him. \u201cI don\u2019t think you want to slide down this slope any further. A couple of weeks ago I found Jag and his friends holding Landon against his will while Jag punched him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, that\u2019s the guy who broke my finger.\u201d</p><p>Cooper put one hand in his pants pocket and glared. \u201cIs that so? Where\u2019s the cast?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wore a splint,\u201d Mr. Morrison said. \u201cThe sore finger, that\u2019s what held him back in the game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cAnd by the way, that would be the second time I witnessed your son bullying and intimidating Landon. The first time was on the beach, from the deck of the bait shop.\u201d</p><p>Sarah noticed Cliff standing in the doorway to the dining room, nervously twisting his hands in a dish towel. There were three other tables of patrons looking at this confrontation in what appeared to be fascination. They were all sitting behind Jag and his parents and couldn\u2019t see the Morrisons\u2019 faces. There was not a clink of a fork or murmur.</p><p>Jag\u2019s mother looked Sarah up and down coldly, meanly. Then she spoke to Cooper. \u201cWell, I see your incentive in making up these stories now....\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Morrison, it isn\u2019t a good idea to insult Commander Dupre. It only suggests where Jag learned his bad manners.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEffie, we\u2019ll go now,\u201d Mr. Morrison said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to participate in some cheap public display. This will be handled legally.\u201d Mr. Morrison moved to his wife\u2019s side, slipped his arm through hers and led the way out of the dining room.</p><p>And Jag, unbelievably, stood still. He silently laughed, tipping his head back. Then he stared at Sarah and made little kissing motions with his lips. And then he closed his eyes into mere slits and ran his tongue around his lips, all the while his hands in his pockets, his expression aggressive and sexual.</p><p>Sarah lost it. She suddenly took a couple of steps as if she\u2019d charge him. Cooper grabbed her around the waist and held on to her, lifting her off the floor. She was reaching toward Jag, kicking her feet.</p><p>Jag jumped back into a table, crashing into it and sending glassware tumbling. He yelled, \u201cHey!\u201d as if he were under attack, though Sarah hadn\u2019t gotten near him. His parents turned back toward the dining room, ready to rescue their poor, victimized son.</p><p>Cliff ran forward, grabbed the boy by the arm to right him, then murmured something like, \u201cWe\u2019ll take care of this,\u201d and hustled him out of the dining room. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>Cooper slowly put Sarah on her feet. He turned her around. He looked calm. She looked furious. \u201cSit down,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>Sarah went back to her chair, but she was seething. Trembling. She could feel eyes on her; she could feel the hot flush on her cheeks. She took a sip of her wine. Then she whispered, \u201cDid you see?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI saw,\u201d Cooper said with a black frown. \u201cHe set you up. He\u2019s a punk.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, still stunned. \u201cListen, Cooper, I\u2019ve been in one or two seedy waterfront bars where you have to be careful and I\u2019ve never been treated like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe it. Even in ugly grunt bars, only the lowest, drunkest men pull that stuff. And he\u2019s seventeen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019d like to leave,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cNo, Sarah. We\u2019re going to stay. We\u2019re going to sit here awhile and talk quietly. I want you to have your wine, try to eat your dinner.\u201d</p> <p>Cliff came to their table. \u201cYou folks okay?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re fine,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cWe\u2019re very excited about that grouper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood!\u201d he said, grinning.</p><p>But Sarah\u2019s hand went to her stomach. When Cliff left she said, \u201cI\u2019m not all that excited.\u201d</p><p>He smiled at her. \u201cTime to get a grip. If you\u2019re going to live in a little town, you have to know who you can trust. You can trust the grouper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou broke his finger?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>\u201cNah. He got in my face, poked me in the chest and told me to take off and leave Landon. I didn\u2019t feel like it. I made a point, that\u2019s all. His finger is fine. I wanted to mess up his face, lying little prick. He\u2019s lucky we walked away.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at him. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are buying dinner,\u201d he said. \u201cMy shins hurt.\u201d</p><p>And her flush deepened.</p><p>Eleven</p><p>Cooper wanted to keep Sarah at the restaurant for a reasonable length of time. For one thing, he wanted to be sure she was completely calmed down and thinking straight. He also intended to be sure they discussed some very important things. While they ate salads, he opened the conversation. Mr. and Mrs. Morrison clearly considered themselves privileged and above the rules. Jag took it even a step further. He was vindictive, cruel and obviously spoiled, with a powerful family who would back him up even when all the facts pointed to his dishonesty and immorality.</p><p>\u201cListen, Sarah, that kid? He\u2019s fearless and dark, dangerous. Obviously, he comes by it honestly\u2014his mother is just as creepy. First of all, if you ever see any of them, the Morrisons, I want you to cross the street to avoid them. Second, we\u2019re going to take this even more seriously and make sure Landon is safe. And third...\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to describe it, but I\u2019m going to tell Mac about what just happened. It was very sick and twisted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey mentioned a lawyer.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPeople say lawyer a lot more than they use lawyers. But they do need one. Their kid went to jail, will have to appear before a judge and has been suspended from school. Landon doesn\u2019t need a lawyer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d she asked. \u201cBecause it sounds like they really believe Landon would lie about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think they do believe it, but that doesn\u2019t make it true,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhere does a kid like that end up in life?\u201d Sarah asked him.</p><p>\u201cProbably cell block five,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cAnd if so, he\u2019ll find out what it\u2019s like to be jumped from behind. Listen, the real important issue here is Landon. He wants to be a big manly guy, all sixteen-year-old boys do. He doesn\u2019t want to appear afraid. You\u2019re going to have to find a way to convince him to take Morrison very seriously.\u201d</p><p>She huffed. \u201cI can try. You might have better luck with that than me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf there\u2019s an opportunity, I will. And I\u2019ll talk to Mac, but I think you should do that, too. Ask Mac what steps you and Landon should take to be safe. Hopefully, the kid\u2019s just an ass.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m trying to figure out how to explain that I could interpret him throwing me kisses and licking his lips as dangerous....\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t that, Sarah. It was the gleam in his eyes. If he\u2019d done that to my girl in front of me ten years ago, I might\u2019ve taken him out. As for Mac, I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll even question you when it comes to your feelings about Morrison. After all, his daughter is involved, if only on the edge of this situation.\u201d</p><p>She was looking at him steadily. Earnestly. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d be relying on a complete stranger for help with this.\u201d</p><p>Cooper was considering many possible responses when Cliff brought the grouper.</p><p>\u201cHere we go,\u201d Cliff said. \u201cMost popular dish in the house. And listen, folks, I\u2019m sorry about what happened earlier. I didn\u2019t see what he did to get a rise out of you, but I didn\u2019t have to. I\u2019ve dealt with that kid and his mother before. His dad, Puck Morrison, is not such a bad guy, unless you\u2019re doing business with him. Then he can get a little fierce, but I never knew him to turn on anyone...\u201d</p><p>\u201cPuck?\u201d Cooper asked.</p><p>\u201cFrom old hockey days.\u201d Then he laughed. \u201cReal old. Puck\u2019s got about thirty years on his wife. I knew her way back. She used to be a tiny little thing with a bad temper. Came from nothin\u2019\u2014she\u2019s a town girl\u2014but you\u2019d think she came from Buckingham Palace. Puck came from Eugene. Effie\u2019s the second wife. He wasn\u2019t quite done with the first one when Effie stepped in. That\u2019s mostly just gossip, but I been around a long time and knew Effie before she had boobs. Seriously, I think Puck bought her boobs, then married her. Or maybe then his wife left him, along with their two older sons. I don\u2019t know what they were doing here tonight. Morrisons don\u2019t usually darken my door. Puck drops in by himself sometimes, just for a beer or some gossip, but the wife likes the country club. She doesn\u2019t waste a lot of time in this old town....\u201d</p><p>He just talked on and on while Cooper and Sarah listened. When he slowed down just a little, Cooper said, \u201cPull up a chair, Cliff. Have a cup of coffee with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, but thanks,\u201d he said, not catching the sarcasm. \u201cEnjoy that grouper. Most popular dish in the house.\u201d</p><p>Cooper and Sarah just smiled at each other across the table. Cooper lifted his fork and said, \u201cTry it. It really is good.\u201d</p><p>As she took a small bite, Cooper was aware of the shift in mood at their table, thanks to Cliff. At least for the moment, it seemed as if Sarah wasn\u2019t thinking about that snotty punk or her brother or her troubles. She chewed slowly, lifted her brows and said, \u201cWow. Excellent! You must come here a lot.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cJust a couple of times. It was recommended and I liked it.\u201d He took his own bite. \u201cSo, I told you I was in four schools in four years. I had no idea I\u2019d end up in the Army, in helicopters. I enlisted because I figured everyone in the Army was from somewhere else and it was probably the only place I wouldn\u2019t be the new guy. But what about you? You move around a lot as a kid?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. Born and raised in Boca Raton, Florida, she grew up surfing, sailing, swimming, diving, playing volleyball, softball and soccer. The conversation was slow and easy, punctuated by his questions and their bites of grouper, rice and asparagus. She loved the sea, thus the Coast Guard. She\u2019d thought she\u2019d like flying, then learned she loved flying helicopters. Until the death of her parents, she\u2019d led a charmed life.</p><p>She married another Coast Guard helicopter pilot, a man her age but junior in rank by a few years. And she described it as a foolish mistake.</p><p>\u201cThere were red flags. I questioned his fidelity before the wedding but he somehow convinced me I was imagining things, that he could never be interested in another woman. It turned out I married a man who thought being faithful was optional. Once caught, he calmly explained he wasn\u2019t cut out for marriage. For monogamy.\u201d</p><p>Cooper was stunned. Of all the stupid and insensitive things he\u2019d done, that hadn\u2019t been one of them. If he became attracted to another woman, enough to want to take her to bed, he saw that as a signal whatever relationship he was in wasn\u2019t working. Duh. He wasn\u2019t naive; men cheated all the time and some rationalized that any woman who wiggled past them was fair game.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you look so dumbfounded?\u201d Sarah asked him.</p><p>He closed his mouth. \u201cSorry. I\u2019m not fifteen. I know it happens all the time. But before the marriage? Why\u2019d he want to get married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a better question. It wasn\u2019t the first time. The Coast Guard is like a small town, especially after about six years. So why didn\u2019t anybody tell me? Why didn\u2019t someone say, Hey, Sarah, this guy\u2019s really been around and he\u2019s broken a few hearts?\u201d</p><p>Cooper couldn\u2019t stop the stain that darkened his cheeks, though he fought it. He\u2019d been accused of breaking hearts, but not by cheating. His crimes were slightly different. He\u2019d been called shiftless and unable to put down roots or plan a real future. He couldn\u2019t seem to get attached. He\u2019d been twice engaged\u2014once because he\u2019d been with a good woman and thought it was time and once because his girlfriend of the moment, also a good woman, asked and he couldn\u2019t think of a reason to say no. Both times he\u2019d been informed he had commitment issues. He was told he was emotionally unavailable, whatever that meant. One said he had problems with intimacy, but he thought his only problem was not enough intimacy\u2014and then he was informed that sex was not intimacy. Really? He was too much of a loner, couldn\u2019t connect, didn\u2019t understand women. Probably true, as far as he knew. And although the breaking up had hurt him enough to try avoiding women, he realized he was probably better off than with either of them.</p><p>And there\u2019d been a whole lot of short-term women. Some very short-term. Right now as he looked across the table at Sarah, who was so hot, he asked himself why. Shouldn\u2019t he have found a long-term mate by now? Did he have a missing chromosome?</p><p>\u201cYou look completely embarrassed,\u201d she pointed out to him.</p><p>He cleared his throat. \u201cI\u2019ve been told I\u2019m a bad bet. That I\u2019m afraid of commitment, intimacy, et cetera. I never thought I was afraid. You don\u2019t have to believe this\u2014I probably wouldn\u2019t if I were you\u2014but I didn\u2019t cheat. I\u2019m no Prince Charming, but I didn\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>Unbelievably, she laughed.</p><p>Cliff chose that minute to bring them coffee and pick up the plates. For someone who had wanted to leave and didn\u2019t think she could eat, Sarah had killed that grouper. Cliff asked if they\u2019d like drinks or dessert and they both shook their heads.</p><p>\u201cSo, why is that funny?\u201d Cooper asked.</p><p>\u201cFirst of all, it doesn\u2019t matter whether I believe you. I have no stake in your past affairs. And second, I\u2019m laughing at myself for depending on help from a guy who has a long history of fear of intimacy and commitment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s been said about me, but I think I\u2019m completely dependable.\u201d He lifted his coffee. Sipped. \u201cI asked how that could be the case, since I had no resistance to getting married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, so you were engaged,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cTwice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd they broke it off?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cOne of each\u2014I was asked to leave the first time. It was about that something I didn\u2019t seem to have and that I still don\u2019t understand. And the second time, I had to end it because of all the arguing. But it seemed to be about that mysterious missing factor again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasy come, easy go,\u201d she said.</p><p>He looked at her over the rim of his coffee cup for a long moment. Then he said, \u201cNo, Sarah. There wasn\u2019t anything easy about it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>She cleared her throat. \u201cAnd yet you find yourself completely dependable?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI do. Hey, I\u2019m here trying to sort out the wishes of some dead guy because he was my friend. I could load up the camper and go, right? It\u2019s not like Ben would put a curse on me. And I didn\u2019t even agree to this job.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey why are you doing it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause no one else will. And it\u2019s the right thing to do\u2014he was a decent guy. Besides,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s not like I can\u2019t spare a few months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I can\u2019t take a few months off,\u201d she said. \u201cAre you rich?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFar from it. But there\u2019s just the fifth wheel, paid for, and no kids. I have three sisters who make sure our parents are fine. I can afford to do this for Ben.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must have been real close,\u201d she said. \u201cBest friends.\u201d</p> <p>Cooper put his elbows on the table and laced his fingers together, looking down for a moment. Then he met her eyes. \u201cI guess. Guys are different, you know....\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI liked Ben. He was my lead mechanic. He made me laugh. I got a kick out of him and tossing back a few with him was always a good time. We stayed in touch. He visited a few times in ten years, but I\u2019d never come up here before. Our whole friendship was mostly emails and phone calls. We had things in common\u2014I had the Gulf of Mexico and he had the Pacific. When I was flying for oil companies, there were a couple of spills, and he called to ask if there was a local wildlife rescue organization I\u2019d like him to make a donation to. He\u2019s always cared about the wildlife, although I didn\u2019t realize how much until I got here. I trusted him. But the truth is, besides my family, I don\u2019t have a lot of friends. Just a few. Good ones, but not that many.\u201d</p><p>After a long moment of silence she said, \u201cMe, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see you as having lots of girlfriends to drink wine with, shop with.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI work in a man\u2019s world. There\u2019s one other female pilot at the station, married. We get along fine, but...our lives are different. And sometimes the wives of the guys I work with don\u2019t...\u201d They were wary of her, like they didn\u2019t trust her. It wasn\u2019t easy being one of the few women in a unit and being single besides. The last time she had a close girlfriend, she found out she\u2019d been sharing her with her fianc\u00e9. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t have a lot of girlfriends. Just a few women I\u2019m friendly with, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSometimes that\u2019s all you need,\u201d he said.</p><p>And then Cooper told her about his buddy, Luke, and Luke\u2019s brothers. Sarah had a couple of guys at the station she\u2019d bonded with, and she was getting to know Gina, whom she liked.</p><p>Cliff was standing beside their table and they both looked up at him. The leather folder containing the check sat on the table and their coffees had been refilled but neither of them seemed to be aware of it.</p><p>\u201cTell you what, folks,\u201d Cliff said. \u201cHow about I leave the keys here and you lock up when you\u2019re ready?\u201d</p><p>It took a second to sink in, then they laughed. The restaurant was empty and Cooper had no memory of seeing people leave. He reached for his wallet.</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t,\u201d Sarah said, grabbing the check. She held it in her custody until she could wrangle her credit card out of her purse. \u201cThis one is mine. You kept me from being convicted of murder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo seconds,\u201d Cliff said, running off with the check.</p><p>Cooper stood and pulled on his jacket. He picked up her long, black coat and held it for her. \u201cThank you, Commander. I\u2019ll get the next one.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou do that, Cooper. Just keep an eye on my brother for me, that\u2019s thanks enough.\u201d Then Cliff was back with a receipt for her to sign. \u201cSorry we kept you up, Cliff,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cHave a nice night, folks,\u201d he said, following them to the door and locking it.</p><p>\u201cIs it late?\u201d she asked Cooper.</p><p>\u201cApparently it\u2019s late for Cliff. My watch says ten-twenty.\u201d</p><p>They drove back to the high school for his truck, talking and laughing. There were still cars in the well-lit lot, still music coming from the gymnasium, but not a soul around the parking lot. Undoubtedly, some kids had managed to escape from under the chaperones\u2019 gazes, but there was still action in there. They got out of the car and gravitated to the front, leaning against the hood and gazing at the school. Sarah sighed. \u201cAnother thing to say thank you for. Even though things got a little whacko at Cliff\u2019s, I could have been trapped behind a decorated pillar in there until midnight.\u201d</p><p>Cooper crossed his arms over his chest. \u201cThat was a nasty business at Cliff\u2019s, but worth seeing. Now there\u2019s no question about what you\u2019re dealing with.\u201d Then he shifted toward her. \u201cIn spite of that, I have to say, Sarah, I enjoyed dinner.\u201d</p><p>She turned so they faced each other and smiled. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll take you out again sometime.\u201d</p><p>He pulled on her arm and brought her closer, against him. \u201cYou\u2019re a good date,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou thought of it as a date?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cFrom the beginning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I have some bad news, Cooper. I\u2019ve given up dating.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t help but grin. \u201cGoing to go old maid?\u201d</p><p>She smirked. \u201cI could change my mind in ten or twenty years. For now, no dating. No men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably a very smart decision.\u201d Then he leaned toward her and got his face close enough so he could feel her breath on his face. \u201cKind of a waste, though.\u201d And then he touched her lips with his.</p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d she said, closing those large eyes.</p><p>He pulled her closer, tilting his head to kiss her. He cradled her head in one hand and held her firmly but gently against his mouth. After the briefest moment, she parted her lips slightly so that their tongues could touch. When that happened he inhaled sharply, damned pleased at the response. One arm around her waist pulled her tight against him, and he moved over her opened mouth hungrily. He kissed her long and hard, even though he thought he shouldn\u2019t. When he finally pulled back just an inch, he said, \u201cNews flash. I\u2019m a man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFriend,\u201d she said. \u201cJust a friend with some common interests.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd one of them is kissing.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cI\u2019m human, after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me five minutes. I could wear you down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn your dreams.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing tomorrow?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cLaundry,\u201d she said. \u201cSunday catch up. Monday is work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. Want me to help with laundry? I\u2019ve been doing my own for years. I\u2019m probably really good with the dainties.\u201d</p><p>She chuckled a little. \u201cNo, thanks.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her again, a little harder. Deeper. He let his tongue loose to play. Her arms slid up to his shoulders and she held on, joining a little tongue dancing. Everything he tasted said yes. He pulled back. \u201cProbably smart not to get involved with someone like me,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNot to worry, champ. I\u2019m not going to get involved with anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I tend to piss women off.\u201d</p><p>And then she pulled him back to her mouth and went after him with steam and power of her own and almost brought him to his knees. How\u2019d she manage to taste like honey and smell like flowers after dinner at Cliff\u2019s? He pulled her hard against him and devoured her, unsure whether he was relieved or disappointed that she wouldn\u2019t feel his erection through that long, heavy coat she wore. And then her hands were against his chest, gently pushing him away. Not shoving, just a little push so he\u2019d back off. She smiled into his eyes.</p><p>\u201cSo far, the way you don\u2019t get involved is made to order,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going home now, Cooper. Thanks for helping out. And everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he said, taking a step back. \u201cWant me to follow you home?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m good.\u201d She gently slugged his chest. \u201cDrive careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said, breathless.</p><p>When she turned to get back into her car, he followed. He held the door and then closed it for her. He waved her off. And then he stood by his truck for a little while as she drove off.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit,\u201d he whispered. \u201cDamn.\u201d</p><p>Landon and Eve left the homecoming dance with Downy and Ashley at about nine-thirty. They got a pizza in town and took it to Landon\u2019s house because no one was home, thanks to Cooper. What a pal.</p><p>They snarfed down pizza and Cokes, laughing over stories everyone had to share. The second the pizza was gone, Downy grabbed his girl, lifted her up and said, \u201cCome here, my girlfriend, and drive me out of my mind some more.\u201d He carried her to the living room, where he chose the sofa for some rock-star-quality making out. After five minutes, he pulled her down the hall of the little house.</p><p>Landon was stunned, his mouth hanging open. \u201cIs he doing what it looks like he\u2019s doing?\u201d</p><p>Eve smiled. \u201cI prefer not to think about that too much. And of course, anything my best friend said to me is confidential.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, yeah,\u201d he said.</p><p>She grinned at him. \u201cYou have to wonder, though, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he wouldn\u2019t do the nasty here, in my bedroom, when my sister could be walking in anytime?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably not,\u201d she said.</p><p>He smiled at her, knowing it was crooked. \u201cEve, I\u2019m sorry you got stuck going to a big dance with a guy whose face is mashed in.\u201d</p><p>She pushed back her kitchen chair and went to him, sitting on his lap. \u201cYou\u2019re still handsome, even with your face mashed in. You got altogether too much attention from the girls, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because of you,\u201d he said. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t believe I was with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes your mouth hurt?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He tilted his head and then slowly touched the place where his lip was split. \u201cJust a little, right here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d she said, leaning forward and kissing him gently right beside it. Then she pressed her lips against his cheek. Then the goose egg on his forehead. Then his lips again. Then she smiled.</p><p>\u201cI could heal up and be less interesting,\u201d he said. \u201cThink you\u2019d go out with me again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could. But you\u2019re going to have to ask me next time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s kinda cool having the prettiest girl at school ask me for a date,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d really like to take you out tomorrow, but maybe by next Saturday night my face won\u2019t look like I\u2019ve been in a wreck.\u201d He put his arms around her waist. \u201cI want my lip healed, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d she teased. \u201cAnd why is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not the only one who\u2019s a good kisser, you know. I\u2019m not bad\u2014when it doesn\u2019t make me bleed.\u201d</p><p>She laughed at him. \u201cWhen\u2019s your birthday? Maybe for your birthday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a coincidence,\u201d Landon said. \u201cNext Saturday night is my birthday!\u201d</p><p>She pulled away a bit, but put her arms around his neck. \u201cI think you\u2019re lying. You wouldn\u2019t lie to me, would you, Landon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the Saturday night after that is my birthday, too,\u201d he said, leaning toward her, his lips ready. \u201cGo easy now,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>And she gave him a light kiss on the side of his mouth.</p><p>\u201cMore,\u201d he whispered, and she was happy to comply, treating him to sweet, soft kisses for a few minutes.</p><p>\u201cWhen you first moved here,\u201d Landon asked, \u201cwas it easy? Did you fit right in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI fit right in with Ash, but we had some issues\u2014like the girlfriends she already had had for a long time were jealous of me because Ash liked me. It took a while before that passed. When my dad took this job and bought the house, I didn\u2019t want to come. I was in seventh grade and I gave him a hard time. He was more patient than he should\u2019ve been, but Lou just about lost it. You don\u2019t want to mess with Aunt Lou. You moved a lot, right?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cCoast Guard. You\u2019re gonna move, that\u2019s how it is. But I loved Alaska. Even though I was just a little kid when we were in Kodiak, I hated to leave. I\u2019d go back there in a second. I\u2019ll go wherever a football team will cover my tuition for college, but if I had my choice, I\u2019d head back to Kodiak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t been very many places,\u201d Eve said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been on some cool camping trips, but if we can\u2019t drive there, we can\u2019t go.\u201d</p> <p>He smiled his lopsided smile and touched her cheek. \u201cNothing wrong with that, Eve. I like camping. So does Sarah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn summer, sometimes a bunch of us camp on the beach,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cReally? All night?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cAnd we try not to notice the deputy\u2019s SUV parked at the edge of the beach.\u201d</p><p>He tightened his arms around her. \u201cGuess there\u2019s no zipping sleeping bags together....\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Landon. He probably nods off. At least that\u2019s what he does in his chair every night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo. There is a God.\u201d</p><p>Gina looked around the colorful gymnasium, now almost empty of people. The teens who had driven their dates started to leave by nine or so; the chaperones followed suit as the number of kids on the dance floor thinned out. Lou McCain was among the first to leave; she wanted to check on Ryan and Dee Dee. Quite a few kids, maybe fifty, hung around the dance until the last dog died and they were herded out the door. Aside from the refreshments, there was very little cleanup. The kids who put up the decorations would be back to strip them down on Sunday afternoon.</p><p>Mac stood near the back door of the gym talking with one of the deputies, Charlie Adams. He rocked back on his heels and laughed\u2014a good sign. Charlie must have stopped by to say the town was quiet with nothing much going on.</p><p>God, but he was perfect. Perfect-looking. As men go, Deputy Yummy Pants was an amazing specimen, but he was apparently a eunuch. Or gay. But either was impossible to grasp. In the four years they\u2019d been good friends, there\u2019d been those couple of times he\u2019d kissed her with awesome, sincere passion...then backed right off on the excuse of parenthood.</p><p>She often wondered if he had some chickie buried somewhere out of sight, some woman he saw regularly who scratched his itch so that around town he could appear completely unattached. Maybe she was a terrible kisser and he came to his senses?</p> <p>Men flirted with her regularly. She was behind the counter at the diner, after all. Nearly every man in town passed her way at one time or another, as did the occasional out-of-towner\u2014the UPS guy, the beverage guy, the guy who delivered the meat. She\u2019d grown up in this town. She\u2019d known a lot of the people forever. After having a baby in high school and keeping her, living with her mother as she did, it had taken quite a lot to retrench her reputation and emerge as one of Thunder Point\u2019s best-liked and most-respected residents. Back in high school, she imagined people whispered that she was a slut. Now they thought of her as upstanding, thanks to years of church, PTA and town meetings. Oh, and very little traffic with the opposite sex, though she had dated a bit here and there.</p><p>Not in the past few years, however. It seemed pointless.</p><p>Before she could brood any longer, Mac was walking toward her with her coat slung over one arm. She wanted to be angry with him for tying up her heart the way he had, but she couldn\u2019t. He might not be her boyfriend or lover, but he was always there for her. Always. The best friend she\u2019d ever had.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she said, taking her coat and shrugging into it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll walk you out,\u201d he said, taking her elbow.</p><p>\u201cThank God the diner doesn\u2019t open at five on Sunday mornings,\u201d she grumbled. \u201cI\u2019m exhausted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need more days off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need bigger tips,\u201d she said as she laughed.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, me, too.\u201d He opened the back door for her. \u201cAnd a good time was had by all,\u201d he said. \u201cNo fights, no accidents and, as far as I know, no illegal drugs or drinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr they\u2019re getting better at hiding it,\u201d she added.</p><p>\u201cNever saw a hint of trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, there was little stuff. Predictable stuff. A couple of girls crying in the bathroom. One over her date, who was acting like an idiot, raving about some other girl\u2019s cleavage. There was one notable clothing malfunction that had to be pinned back into place\u2014an entire breast escaped and every high school boy in the room claimed to have seen it. And then you have the mean girls\u2014Patrice, Stellie and Harmony.\u201d She sighed. \u201cI think Harmony is the worst one. She just can\u2019t live up to her name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did the mean girls do?\u201d he wanted to know.</p><p>\u201cBeing a guy, you probably wouldn\u2019t catch on. They stick together in a little clot, whisper, shift their eyes toward their victim du jour\u2014some younger, simpler, more vulnerable creature\u2014and then they giggle. That sort of thing. Lean toward each other on the dance floor, whisper and stare, laugh. Spread rumors, like saying Lindsay got her dress at the Goodwill until Lindsay\u2014who did get her dress at the Goodwill\u2014ends up in the bathroom crying, begging to just go home.\u201d</p><p>He looked a little shell-shocked. \u201cThat\u2019s horrible!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith all the things you see on the job, I\u2019m surprised you\u2019re surprised. People can behave very badly. Especially teenagers.\u201d It didn\u2019t even bear mentioning what her generation of mean girls had to say about her when she turned up pregnant at fifteen.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t stand to think of some nice girl like Lindsay crying over her secondhand dress! My kids have all worn secondhand clothes. Lou gets pretty excited about good hand-me-downs and, God knows, a sheriff\u2019s deputy with three kids isn\u2019t shopping at the high-end stores. How\u2019d you know that was happening?\u201d</p><p>She gave a shrug. \u201cI\u2019ve done my share of bathroom crying. Not for a very long time, however.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEve and Ash aren\u2019t putting up with crap like that, are they?\u201d he asked. \u201cIf you knew, you\u2019d tell me, right?\u201d</p><p>She stopped walking and turned to look up at him. \u201cListen, Mac, the girls are pretty secure. They present a strong front. Ash has got Downy on alert and not only is he a big strong boy, but there\u2019s still a little hero worship at the school. In spite of that, they occasionally have their dramas. But if I knew either of them were being persecuted by mean girls, I\u2019d tell Lou.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLou would probably tell you, if she thought it was serious. But men tend to say things like, Aw, don\u2019t let \u2019em get to you. Girls need sympathy. Vindication. A soft shoulder to cry on, encouragement. Men just want their girls to rise above it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that true?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>He thought for a minute. \u201cI think you might be right. I might say something like that. And I might think it was the right thing to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. It\u2019s not about how much you love your daughters, Mac. It\u2019s more what you\u2019re programmed to say.\u201d</p><p>He walked with her again and opened the door to her Jeep. \u201cHow do you know these things? You haven\u2019t had a man around in forever. No dad, no husband, no steady boyfriend unless you keep him hidden. Yet you know how men work.\u201d</p><p>She slipped into her Jeep and smiled at him. \u201cPure genius,\u201d she said. \u201cSee you later.\u201d</p><p>Twelve</p><p>The diner on Sunday mornings was a different kind of place than the rest of the week. It was a good place for families to stop on the way home from church or on the way to some outing. There were also weekend athletes and pleasure seekers\u2014cyclists or, in warmer weather, sports fishermen, paddleboard enthusiasts, people taking their boats out for a nice day on the bay.</p><p>Gina didn\u2019t work at the diner every Sunday, but she didn\u2019t mind when she did. She liked the mornings and only worked the dinner hour if she was filling in for someone. From her place behind the counter, she saw the new town doctor pull his van up to his storefront clinic across the street. He got out, this time with two children\u2014a little girl and little boy. He had one on each hand, but rather than going inside the clinic, he walked across the street to the diner. Gina had only seen him from a distance, going in or out of that space. And she had never seen the children.</p><p>They were so little, so young. She\u2019d heard from Mac that he was a single father, but it was hard to imagine how he could put in doctor hours and parent full-time, even with a babysitter. He held the door for them, first the little girl, then the little boy. She could tell from across the street that he was a nice-looking man, but up close he was better than that\u2014he was gorgeous. And the children? Delicious.</p><p>\u201cMorning,\u201d she said from behind the counter. \u201cSit anywhere you like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about right here? At the counter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe my guest.\u201d</p><p>He lifted his daughter onto a stool first, then his son. The little girl had shiny hair pulled back with barrettes and wore a little green jumper over a long-sleeved T-shirt and white tights. The little boy, his hair cut in a short, adult style and neatly combed, had a couple of cowlicks. He wore jeans and little boots and a denim jacket. Both the kids had mahogany-colored hair and huge brown eyes, while the doctor had dark blond hair with blue eyes. Very kind blue eyes.</p><p>When the kids were settled on their stools, he put out his hand. \u201cScott Grant,\u201d he said.</p><p>She took the hand. \u201cGina James. So nice to meet you. And who are your friends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is Jenny and this is Will. Age three and four.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re beautiful,\u201d she said. \u201cSo? Coffee? Juice? Breakfast? Parenting advice for when they\u2019re teenagers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate it,\u201d he said with a laugh. \u201cI\u2019d love a cup of coffee and the kids would like juice\u2014maybe apple? And if you have it, cereal for them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd for you?\u201d she asked, filling his cup.</p><p>\u201cJust coffee,\u201d he said. \u201cI woke up early and already had breakfast.\u201d</p><p>She quickly set up the juice and cereal for the kids. Then she said, \u201cIt\u2019s very exciting to have a clinic opening up. We haven\u2019t had a doctor\u2019s office in town for about five years now. We had a couple of doctors here when I was growing up, but one retired and one moved, joining a busy practice in Eugene. The nearest hospital or urgent care is Bandon. If you need a few stitches or some blood work, it\u2019s a major time investment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I hope that will change, but we\u2019re a long way from opening. I\u2019m working in Bandon now, helping out a family practitioner and taking call at the hospital E.R. while I get this set up. Just buying and installing the equipment is a major undertaking\u2014and the office still needs cleaning up and decorating. And I haven\u2019t even thought about staff. I don\u2019t suppose you know any R.N.s around here who are looking for a change?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t. I\u2019m sorry. But if you give me a list of what you\u2019re looking for, this isn\u2019t a bad place to spread the word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, that\u2019s a good idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I understand you have an au pair for the kids? Small town, you know,\u201d she added with a smile and shrug.</p><p>\u201cGabriella. I knew her parents in Vancouver. She\u2019s a brilliant girl, if a little old-fashioned. She\u2019s also beautiful. Smart and hardworking and dependable...\u201d He stopped, looking a little startled by what he\u2019d said. He leaned toward her as if he needed to say something very personal. \u201cHey,\u201d he said. \u201cSmall town here. Are people around here going to be put off or suspicious of my relationship with a nineteen-year-old au pair? I\u2019m a thirty-six-year-old man, a widower, and have absolutely no\u2014\u201d</p><p>She held up a hand and smiled at him. \u201cDon\u2019t borrow trouble,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re kind of a bunch of hicks on the water around here, but I know of a couple of girls from town who took au pair jobs to get to Europe. You\u2019ll probably find that she\u2019s referred to more often as your babysitter.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cThere aren\u2019t many options,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t afford a full-time housekeeper and nanny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be okay, Scott. If I might ask, why Thunder Point?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, slower pace, so I don\u2019t miss too much of the kids\u2019 growing up. But it\u2019s really an experiment. I\u2019ve never lived in a small town. This town has a good reputation, you know. A lot of community involvement, good schools, low crime...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re not very cosmopolitan, but it\u2019s a good place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe cost of living is low,\u201d he added.</p><p>\u201cAnd speaking of living, where are you living?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBandon, for the time being, keeping an eye open for something in town. I\u2019ve looked at a couple of rentals, but they were in pretty bad shape.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOne problem with a small town, property doesn\u2019t turn over too often.\u201d Gina smiled. \u201cI\u2019ll keep an eye open for that, too.\u201d</p><p>Thirty minutes later Gina had introduced Dr. Grant to a few folks from town who had come in for breakfast, made a short list of what he was looking for in housing and staff, and shook his hand as they said goodbye. A few people came and went, leaving Gina plenty of time to refill napkin holders, salt-and-pepper shakers, sugar caddies. The little bell on the diner door tinkled just as Gina was filling her last ketchup bottle. She smiled to see Sarah come in. \u201cHey,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cHey, yourself.\u201d She sat up on a stool.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re early today and no Hamlet,\u201d Gina said, peering out the diner\u2019s glass door. \u201cBreakfast?\u201d There was a family of five in a big booth in the corner, the youngest in a high chair, and an elderly couple in another booth. Both parties were finishing their meals. It was late for breakfast, early for lunch. Stu could be seen through the cook\u2019s slat in the wall, moving around with his iPod earbuds in his ears.</p><p>\u201cNot today, thanks. But I won\u2019t turn down a cup of coffee. I\u2019ll take Ham out later, or Landon will. How are you recuperating from all the hard work you and the others did for the dance last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot much work on my part,\u201d Gina said, filling a cup. \u201cThe kids and teachers did most of the work. I just showed up to keep an eye on things. And things seemed to go fairly smoothly.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI got home last night to find my brother, Eve McCain, your daughter and Downy at my house. I went out to dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI noticed you were gone,\u201d she said with a smile. \u201cThe kids usually pick my house to hang after a dance, if they\u2019re not on the beach. My mother has no problem turning the volume up on the TV in her bedroom and falling asleep. They could be building bombs for all she knows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey seemed to be sitting around the kitchen table at my house after devouring a pizza and a bunch of Cokes, laughing at whatever. I was home by ten-thirty,\u201d Sarah told her. \u201cIt was such a relief to see Landon hanging out with friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI noticed a certain newcomer was also gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCooper and I went to dinner at Cliffhanger\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like him. Cooper. He seems like a good guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe does, doesn\u2019t he? Landon likes him and I\u2019ll admit, I\u2019m getting kind of used to the idea of Cooper looking out for Landon. He\u2019s probably doing that because there\u2019s no man around the house. As long as Cooper doesn\u2019t sell him to the circus, that could be helpful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you raised him entirely alone?\u201d Gina asked.</p> <p>\u201cAlmost. I took custody when he was six, ten years ago, after our parents died. I lived with a guy for a year when Landon was thirteen, then was married to him for almost a year when we were separated. He was devoted to Landon...until we broke up.\u201d She gave a shrug. \u201cFor a couple of years there, I had someone to pitch in. And I was married for almost a year. Derek, my ex, liked to watch Landon play ball. I\u2019ve been divorced nine months now. Derek was the only guy I let in, and he was a big mistake. Apparently I\u2019m not real good at picking \u2019em.\u201d</p><p>Gina smiled and poured herself a cup of coffee. \u201cWant help? I can spot a loser a mile away. Now, that is. I wasn\u2019t so good at it when I was a teenager. I had a doozy then. I was fortunate enough not to marry him. Through no brilliance of my own, I might add. I sobbed every miserable night, hoping he\u2019d come back and beg me to marry him. But I was a kid. Left with a kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now you have Mac,\u201d Sarah said.</p><p>The family of five were leaving. Dad stopped at the counter to give Gina the check and some money, telling her to keep the change.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Gina told Sarah with a laugh, shaking her head. \u201cMac and I are friends. We have been since our daughters hooked up as best friends. As friends go, he\u2019s the best. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s dating anyone\u2014he hasn\u2019t ever brought a woman around to games or town things, but there might be someone somewhere. Why? Are you interested?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou get teased about him,\u201d Sarah said. \u201cPeople put you two together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople must have very vivid imaginations. If I had a guy, hopefully you\u2019d at least see some hand-holding. Mac and I have gone to a movie or two, but usually he\u2019s dragging a kid or Lou along. We sit together at the games, but other than that...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were a couple. Maybe discreet, but a couple...\u201d</p><p>Gina shook her head. \u201cNo. I guess a lot of people think that. I think they can\u2019t imagine a friend of the opposite sex. Nah, I love Mac, but he\u2019s a free agent. If you like him, go for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not making this easy,\u201d Sarah said.</p><p>Gina tilted her head and shot Sarah a nonplussed expression. \u201cI could gift wrap him for you, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t trust men,\u201d Sarah said. \u201cI don\u2019t even trust many women and I don\u2019t trust myself, either. I thought my ex was a prince, the catch of a lifetime. He was Mr. Romance, so it never occurred to me he could be that attentive and affectionate with me if he...\u201d She cleared her throat. \u201cIt turned out he had a lot of romantic energy. And a very short attention span.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEw. Hate those.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would take a lot to tempt me now. I have zero interest in being dumped by a man again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow some people would say you should get back on that horse,\u201d Gina said with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cAnd did you? After you had Ashley?\u201d</p><p>The elderly couple slowly made their way to the counter. Gina took their ticket, their money, rang them up with a smile, told them to have a nice Sunday.</p><p>Then she returned to Sarah. \u201cIt took me a while. Ashley was my life and I was all about protecting her from my potential mistakes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a lot of that going on,\u201d Sarah admitted. \u201cWhen Derek left, he left Landon, too. And he left Landon with a sister who was an emotional cripple. I have to be careful. He\u2019s a big kid, very mature for his age, but he\u2019s still just a kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. They think they know everything, but they\u2019re just kids. And they\u2019re right at that age when the biggest mistakes seem to hit them. I\u2019m living proof of that. I didn\u2019t go out on a date till Ashley was five years old. And then I was cautious. So careful my few dates lost interest in me, not the other way around. I think I always felt safest if I wasn\u2019t involved with a guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d Sarah said. \u201cExcept...I kissed Cooper.\u201d</p><p>Surprise registered on Gina\u2019s face for a moment, then she said, \u201cI take it that didn\u2019t fit into your plans?\u201d</p><p>Sarah took a sip of coffee. \u201cI\u2019ve been asked out a couple of times since the divorce. I even had one guy from a Coast Guard station not too far away get all excited that I was divorced and ask me out a number of times before he finally got the message, I am not dating. Not. Period. And I have not been tempted to even rethink it. I figured when I was about forty and Landon was all grown-up and on his own, I might consider it, but not anytime soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess kissing isn\u2019t exactly dating,\u201d Gina said carefully.</p><p>\u201cIt terrifies me to even think about a relationship with a man. It was like this with Derek\u2014he was so attentive, and it took him two seconds to get close to Landon,\u201d Sarah said. \u201cEven though Landon might not realize it, he\u2019s vulnerable. Besides, our lives work pretty well, the two of us. He\u2019s such a great kid. We take good care of each other. I\u2019m not risking Landon\u2019s feelings by getting mixed up with some guy, especially some guy he likes.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cRed flags everywhere. Everywhere. You have no idea what Derek put us through.\u201d</p><p>Gina gulped. \u201cI don\u2019t want to ask, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I brought it up. Derek cheated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI assumed that\u2019s what you meant by a lot of romantic energy.\u201d</p><p>Sarah sipped her coffee again. \u201cA good friend of mine,\u201d she said, and her cheeks brightened.</p><p>\u201cWhat a dog!\u201d</p><p>Sarah laughed suddenly. \u201cIt was a dog, as a matter of fact, that showed me his true colors. I called his cell and I heard a dog barking in the background. It sounded just like the dog next door to my ex-friend Susan\u2019s house. That dog never shut up. He was there and he lied\u2014and I let him convince me I was insane, that he could never do such a thing.\u201d</p><p>Gina took a moment to refill her coffee cup. \u201cNo wonder you don\u2019t trust women. How did you find out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe decided to unburden her guilty conscience,\u201d Sarah said. \u201cI think she was angry with Derek. I think she was losing him, but not to me. He admitted they\u2019d had a thing. A purely physical thing. And he was sorry, but he said he wasn\u2019t good at monogamy and hoped we could\u2014\u201d she cleared her throat \u201c\u2014work with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy God,\u201d Gina said in a breath. She leaned toward Sarah. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t even happen on General Hospital. How did Landon take it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried to keep him from knowing, but he figured it out. I think he hates Derek. No, I know he hates Derek. And now I\u2019ve gone and kissed Cooper, his friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe it was an accident,\u201d Gina said. \u201cHe\u2019s pretty sweet and sexy, after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, there you have it. Cooper is all wrong. All wrong.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cNot only is he male, which makes him dangerous, he is a rover. A nomad. He\u2019s planning to leave the minute that bait shop is fixed up. No, sir, I\u2019m not going to fall for him. No way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnderstandable...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have never wanted to be kissed more in my life. I wanted to rip his clothes off. I wanted to climb all over him. I didn\u2019t just let him kiss me, I nearly ate him alive. Right after I told him there was no way I was dating or getting involved with a man. He probably thinks I\u2019m a lunatic.\u201d</p><p>They stared at each other for a long, silent moment. Then Gina said, \u201cWow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I have to move,\u201d Sarah said, dropping her head into her hand and running her fingers through her short hair.</p><p>Gina felt a warm flush rise up her neck to her face. Sarah would have no way of knowing that Gina also had one of those ferocious big-girl crushes, and no solution in sight. Gina had not confided in anyone, not even her mother\u2014and she was very close to Carrie. She didn\u2019t dare. One slip would find Ashley talking to Eve about it and then Lou would soon know and Lou... Lou couldn\u2019t be trusted to keep from saying something to Mac. And then? Who knew? Mac might quit coming by for coffee or stop sitting with her at games if he thought she was some maniac about to debauch him.</p><p>\u201cOh, God, I\u2019ve embarrassed you,\u201d Sarah said. \u201cOh, Gina, I\u2019m sorry! It\u2019s just that it\u2019s been so long since I\u2019ve had a woman to talk to about stuff like this. Oh, hell, it\u2019s been so long since I had stuff like this.\u201d</p><p>Gina shook her head. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not that. Not at all. It\u2019s just that I\u2019ve been in your shoes. Quite a while ago, really, but I do remember. That powerful crush, that feeling of complete helplessness.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cHelplessness. The thing I really can\u2019t deal with at all. You can\u2019t do what I do if you feel out of control and helpless. Man...if we hadn\u2019t been standing in a parking lot...\u201d</p><p>\u201cParking lot?\u201d Gina asked.</p> <p>\u201cAt the high school. But there was no one around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you know of,\u201d Gina said. \u201cThere could\u2019ve been teenagers in parked cars, making out. Or whatever.\u201d</p><p>Sarah groaned. She rubbed the bridge of her nose with a finger and thumb. \u201cThank God Landon was already home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s probably fine. There was probably no one to see. But maybe you should be prepared, in case, you know...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat am I going to do? Say?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSmile. Like this,\u201d Gina said, demonstrating a mysterious smile. \u201cYou\u2019re over twenty-one. He\u2019s over twenty-one. Kissing isn\u2019t illegal and it doesn\u2019t necessarily lead to marriage. Sometimes it doesn\u2019t even lead to more kissing. It\u2019s not poor form to have a kiss good-night after a dinner out. You really don\u2019t have to explain to anyone. You certainly don\u2019t have to apologize.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d she said, giving a nod. \u201cExcept, this would be such a mistake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember, people aren\u2019t in your head, Sarah. They don\u2019t know the idea of a man scares you to death or that you\u2019re determined not to set yourself up for disappointment again. No one knows but me, and I\u2019m not telling.\u201d Then she grinned. \u201cWe should go out sometime. I mean, really out\u2014not just to Cliffhanger\u2019s. We should go to Bandon or Coquille or something. Someplace where we\u2019re not sharing secrets in front of the neighbors.\u201d Then she threw a look over her shoulder. \u201cOr the cook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my God! Do you think Stu...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne thing about Stu, if he hears something interesting, he can\u2019t stay out of it. He\u2019d be right out here giving you advice. This is his downtime before lunch. He\u2019s probably done cleaning his kitchen and in his office, pretending to do paperwork while he watches sports on his little TV. Paperwork that he\u2019ll just ask me to do later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so embarrassed. If it had been Ray Anne in the parking lot, she\u2019d have been bent over the hood of the car with her skirt around her waist in just seconds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWay. Some people think the high school football team was named in her honor. The Cougars.\u201d</p><p>They both laughed and Gina refilled their coffees.</p><p>\u201cWhat am I going to do about him? I really can\u2019t afford to move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll figure it out,\u201d Gina said, lifting her cup. \u201cOne thing I do know, though. A couple of girls like us, we shouldn\u2019t have such pathetic love lives. It just isn\u2019t healthy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve only tried having a love life a couple of times since college\u2014and it hasn\u2019t gone well.\u201d</p><p>After a moment of silence, Gina said, \u201cA good friend of yours?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah. I know. Does it get any worse than that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoly Jesus, girlfriend. That\u2019s almost as bad as getting knocked up at fifteen.\u201d</p><p>Cooper was sitting on a chair he\u2019d dragged down to the dock because the building noise in the bar was too loud to think. The renovation had started and was in full swing, the progress already measurable. He was impressed they were working on Saturday. The contractor said, \u201cEvery day off is a day without pay.\u201d</p><p>This was right up Rawley\u2019s alley. He came over every morning, never said a thing, worked as support staff. If he was asked to do something, like hold a board or tool or drag some debris to the industrial-size Dumpster, he gave a nod and did so. He left when he was ready. Or maybe when he figured his father needed him at home. Cooper was doing his best to log his hours so he could pay him.</p><p>Cooper\u2019s laptop was open and he was surfing the net when he saw her. Sarah, with Ham, racing through the surf at water\u2019s edge. It had been way too long; a week had passed like a year. Even now, her trek across the beach was too slow.</p><p>He stopped looking at the laptop. A smile tugged at his lips. She had a way of walking that just knocked him out, a gentle sway, a purposeful yet unhurried stride. It wasn\u2019t erotic or flirtatious, it was all woman\u2014a woman who knew what she wanted. And as she got near, she smiled at him. Ham made it to him first and he took the soggy ball out of his drooling mouth and threw it. He wiped his hand on his pants. Within seconds, Hamlet was back for another throw.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she said.</p><p>He closed the laptop. \u201cWhere have you been?\u201d</p><p>She put a foot up on the dock. \u201cMostly working.\u201d</p><p>\u201c24/7?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cDid you need something, Cooper?\u201d</p><p>He needed another one of those crazy, deep, incredible kisses that made him go all flat-footed. \u201cI wanted to call you, ask you to dinner. My treat. I don\u2019t have your phone number.\u201d</p><p>Instead of answering with an excited acceptance to both the date and her number, she asked, \u201cWhatcha doing there? Emails?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooking at job postings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, you\u2019re ready to go back to work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust looking. I\u2019m curious about what\u2019s out there. I\u2019ll have to get a job eventually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, what\u2019s out there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLots of instructor positions, mostly civilian jobs with the Army. Some civilian rescue, one corporate chopper, and then there\u2019s firefighting\u2014primarily California, Arizona and Colorado.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInteresting. Obviously, I\u2019ve never looked. Anything around here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe closest is California.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sending in r\u00e9sum\u00e9s?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m just curious. I\u2019m not ready yet.\u201d</p><p>She laughed at that. \u201cI have to admit, I\u2019m envious. Aside from leave, I haven\u2019t taken much time off. Never more than two weeks, and I usually eat most of that up moving. You don\u2019t like to make plans, do you, Cooper?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI make some. I need to see my family pretty soon\u2014they\u2019re getting cranky. It\u2019s been almost a year. I\u2019m teasing them with a possible Christmas showing, but it\u2019s still a maybe. You do like plans, don\u2019t you, Sarah?\u201d</p><p>She nodded and smiled. \u201cDown to the second, months in advance, if possible. I\u2019m very well organized.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr controlling,\u201d he suggested.</p><p>\u201cPossibly, but that\u2019s irrelevant, as I only control my own activities. I try to stay flexible where my brother is concerned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLandon\u2019s looking better,\u201d Cooper said.</p><p>\u201cI figured you\u2019d seen him this week\u2014he had to take a week off from football practice. He\u2019s a little irritable. He goes to practice to watch\u2014although I\u2019m not sure what he\u2019s watching more closely, the plays or the cheerleaders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you talk to him about Morrison?\u201d Cooper asked.</p><p>\u201cI did. I told him about the restaurant scene. Did he say anything to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot until I told him myself. It seemed to make him angry and more worried about you than himself. Have you talked to Mac?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI called him early last week. And Mac also talked to Landon. He has an edge, you know. Landon and Mac\u2019s daughter are an item\u2014the romance of the homecoming dance hasn\u2019t worn off. Landon is now convinced to tell Mac if there\u2019s any trouble.\u201d She smiled at him. \u201cI\u2019m surprised you didn\u2019t ask Landon for my cell number if you wanted it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure if that was a good idea,\u201d he said. \u201cUnless you confide in your brother, he doesn\u2019t know we...\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cWhat we did after dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was just a kiss, Cooper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. I\u2019ve been kissed. It wasn\u2019t just a kiss. I\u2019ve been thinking\u2014\u201d</p><p>He was cut off by the sound of a horn. He turned to see a late-model BMW inching its way down the road toward the building. The driver honked again.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d Sarah asked.</p><p>\u201cI have no idea,\u201d he said, not making a move.</p><p>\u201cShould you go see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cI should get your phone number. And we should plan a date or something.\u201d</p><p>But the BMW parked and who should get out but Ray Anne. She stood next to her car and waved at them.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d Cooper said. He waved back, but he didn\u2019t move.</p><p>\u201cCooper, I think she wants you to go up there, talk to her or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m busy,\u201d he said. \u201cNow come on, don\u2019t make me beg.\u201d</p><p>Sarah laughed at him. \u201cI think that idea has merit. Beg for me, Cooper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHank! Hank Cooper!\u201d came Ray Anne\u2019s distant cry. Ah, there she was, standing on the deck with a briefcase in one hand and a purse strap over her shoulder. It was a beautiful, sunny day, but it was still chilly on the bay. Ray Anne was dressed in a short black skirt with a slit up one side that was apparent even from this great distance. She also wore a short black jacket with something red under it, her cleavage straining to be free, and high-heeled boots. Her teased blond hair didn\u2019t move in the wind.</p><p>Cooper just waved again, not getting up.</p><p>\u201cCooper,\u201d Sarah said disapprovingly, but with humor in her voice. \u201cYou are incredibly rude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m rude? Did I go to her house, stand up on her hill and shout at her? I didn\u2019t invite her, she didn\u2019t call ahead. She\u2019s rude. I\u2019m busy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes she have your number?\u201d Sarah asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, you can count on it, although I didn\u2019t give it to her. I also never told her my given name, but she called me Hank the first time we met, even though Mac introduced me as Cooper. She wants something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUndoubtedly,\u201d Sarah said.</p><p>And here she came, picking her way down the wooden stairs that led to the beach, not exactly the best path for high heels and a tight, short skirt.</p><p>\u201cIf she falls, you\u2019re going to have to marry her to keep from getting sued,\u201d Sarah said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to put a rail on those stairs. Two rails, one on each side.\u201d Cooper groaned. \u201cCome on, Sarah. Make her go away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I think I\u2019m going to go away. You\u2019re on your own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d he grumbled. \u201cThis started out so well, too. I was just about to score.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look now, hotshot\u2014with very little effort, you can still score.\u201d And then she laughed again. \u201cI just love it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to pay for this,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWell, Hank! Sarah!\u201d Ray Anne was a little breathless. \u201cWhat are you two up to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m walking the dog on the beach,\u201d Sarah said. \u201cHow are you, Ray Anne?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWonderful! Fantastic! Bleech,\u201d she added as Hamlet nudged her with his drooling mouth and left a gob on her short black skirt.</p><p>\u201cOh, sorry,\u201d Sarah said, pulling a rag out of her pocket and wiping at the skirt. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t mean to be disgusting, he\u2019s just a sweet dog with a saliva issue. There, I think I got it. Does that look all right to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Ray Anne said impatiently. \u201cShouldn\u2019t he be on a leash?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably, but it would have very little impact on the saliva problem or his ability to spread it. He\u2019s just about as big as you are, Ray Anne.\u201d Then she turned to Cooper. \u201cNice seeing you, Cooper. Good luck on the job search.\u201d And she turned abruptly and fled.</p><p>\u201cJob search?\u201d Ray Anne asked. \u201cWhat kind of job?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust poking around the internet to see if there\u2019s anything interesting out there. What brings you to the beach, Ray Anne?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cOh. I wanted to talk to you about something. About your property.\u201d</p><p>Thirteen</p><p>So, Ray Anne wanted to talk about his property? He didn\u2019t even stand up. \u201cWhat\u2019s on your mind?\u201d he asked, half his attention focused on Sarah jogging across the beach with her dog. He fully realized he wasn\u2019t being polite. His mother would twist his ear for this kind of behavior. Cooper wasn\u2019t typically like this around a lady, but first of all, Ray Anne was no lady. Second, she wanted something and at his expense. Third, she had foiled what he considered to be an important move with Sarah.</p> <p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we go inside,\u201d she suggested. \u201cIt\u2019s a little cold on the water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it feels good out here. And there\u2019s too much construction going on in the shop for us to have a conversation there.\u201d He wasn\u2019t about to get behind closed doors with her. He was quite sure she wouldn\u2019t attack him, but he was in no mood for innuendo. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just tell me what brings you to my humble dock.\u201d</p><p>With a heavy sigh, Ray Anne continued. \u201cThe rumor is you\u2019re planning to sell this beautiful property. I\u2019m hoping for two things. Number one, that you\u2019ll give me a chance to represent you and, two, that you\u2019ll let me bring you an interested party.\u201d</p><p>He lifted both eyebrows. \u201cYou already have an interested buyer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHank, there\u2019s been serious interest in this property for twenty years,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is primo beachfront with a lot of attached land.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut it\u2019s all uphill!\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cWhat can anyone do with a beach at the bottom of a hill?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess you\u2019ve never seen Newport Coast, California. Look it up on Google later\u2014it\u2019s gorgeous, one of the best resort properties in the U.S. Ben and his father wouldn\u2019t consider selling even a portion of this land and it could\u2019ve made them wealthy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d he said. \u201cWho is the interested party?\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cHank, this is business. I can\u2019t disclose that information without a contract to represent the sale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. Of course,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd why would I want to be represented in the sale by the agent for the buyer?\u201d</p><p>She smiled very broadly. \u201cBecause, darling, there could be a substantial discount in fees. No matter who represents you, no one can make you sell at any price, so you\u2019re always in the driver\u2019s seat. And I always represent the seller, even when I can find a buyer.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cInteresting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you never sold property before?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNot personally. But I bet I\u2019m a pretty quick study.\u201d He finally stood, towering over her five-foot-two frame. \u201cThe thing is, Ray Anne, I\u2019m really not there yet. Right now I just want to get Ben\u2019s personal effects taken care of and fix up that shop. I haven\u2019t decided what I\u2019m going to do yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are some of the options you\u2019re considering?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m considering just renting it,\u201d he said, and watched her face fall. For just a moment, he felt kind of bad\u2014that hadn\u2019t been one of his considerations at all. Obviously, there was no big commission if he did that. \u201cOr I might sell the structure and the land it sits on. Or\u2014\u201d he shrugged \u201c\u2014who knows? I have plenty of time to think things over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re not interested in staying here, operating the business?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNot that it\u2019s not a beautiful place. It\u2019s just not the work I want to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd just what work do you want to do?\u201d</p> <p>He found it hard to believe she didn\u2019t know. He suspected Ray Anne of superior investigative skills. \u201cBy trade, I\u2019m a helicopter pilot. For the last fifteen years, since the Army.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d she asked. \u201cNo kidding? I guess you know Sarah Dupre is a helicopter pilot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt seems we have that in common.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFantastic! Okay, listen, Hank\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCooper,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople call me Cooper.\u201d</p><p>She ignored him. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter to me how long you think this over, but can I just show you some numbers? You should be fully aware of your options. And can we please get out of this wind?\u201d She patted her hair, as if to keep it from blowing.</p><p>He grinned at her. Her short blond hair wasn\u2019t even moving in the wind. She wanted to be inside with him. She wanted to corner him. \u201cSure,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can sit on the deck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe deck? If it\u2019s too noisy inside the shop, maybe we could go in your trailer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, it\u2019s not a good idea. The maid hasn\u2019t been in today yet. But if you\u2019d like me to come to your office someday...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe deck it is,\u201d she said, heading for the beach stairs.</p><p>He smiled as he watched her head up the stairs. She wasn\u2019t going to let him get away if she had his attention. He knew too well that she fully intended to impress and excite him with some appraised values and comparisons. So they would sit on the porch with the sound of saws and hammers drowning out their conversation. But he would not make any kind of commitment.</p><p>He held a chair beside one of the deck tables for Ray Anne and sat opposite. She pulled a stack of papers out of her leather briefcase and began explaining some of the appraised values of beachfront property in the area. Cooper tried to keep his expression flat, as if he already knew the staggering amount this inheritance could be worth, as if he was not at all surprised. In fact, he was blown away. It could be worth millions to a big hotel or resort chain.</p><p>It briefly crossed his mind that any fool would stop the building inside the shop and just hammer up a for-sale sign.</p><p>\u201cImpressive, wouldn\u2019t you say?\u201d Ray Anne asked.</p><p>\u201cVery nice,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd who is this interested party?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgain, Hank, I\u2019m not willing to disclose that without a contract to represent the sale of the property.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m not ready to make that decision yet,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWell, here\u2019s what we can do. We can make an agreement that when and if you do make the decision to sell\u2014which of course you must, if you\u2019re not planning to stay here and operate a business on this site\u2014that I will be your agent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no must about anything, Ray Anne,\u201d he said. \u201cI haven\u2019t decided what I\u2019m going to do, when I\u2019m going to do it, if I\u2019m going to do anything at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re not planning to take up residence here?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, tilting his head. \u201cThere are so many possibilities. I might just hold the title for forty years, let my heirs make that decision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeirs?\u201d she asked with piqued interest.</p><p>\u201cI have a large family,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cChildren?\u201d she asked.</p><p>His phone tweeted in his pocket. He pulled it out and looked at the caller ID. \u201cExcuse me, Ray Anne. I have to take this.\u201d</p><p>When Sarah walked into her small house, Ham went straight for the water bowl. Sarah could hear the shower running. Two seconds later, she heard the blow-dryer. Landon\u2019s pocket paraphernalia sat on the table\u2014wallet, truck keys, loose change, iPhone.</p><p>She scrolled through his contacts, found Cooper\u2019s name and number and jotted it down on her grocery list, stuffing it in her pocket. Within five minutes, Landon was in the kitchen, scooping his gear off the tabletop.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you off to?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cHomework at Eve\u2019s,\u201d he said.</p><p>Complete waste of a Saturday unless you were helplessly in love, she thought. \u201cWill you be home for dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope not,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ll be okay, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I can manage,\u201d she said with a smile. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll go out. Or get a pizza. Or hit the leftovers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t cook for me, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She laughed. \u201cCan you let me know your plans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t I always?\u201d Landon asked.</p><p>When he was gone, she pulled her list and her phone out of her pocket. She put in the numbers. When Cooper answered, she said, \u201cNow you have my number. And obviously, I have yours.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cHow\u2019d you manage that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI peeked in Landon\u2019s phone directory. He\u2019s gone to do homework with Eve, looking more like he was going for a job interview.\u201d</p><p>Again with the laugh, which was altogether too sexy and low. \u201cI\u2019m in the middle of something, but almost finished. Can I call you back? Five minutes or so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope I didn\u2019t interrupt anything...important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. Perfect timing. Talk to you soon.\u201d</p><p>She disconnected, but held the phone in a tight grip. It\u2019s okay, she thought. I\u2019m a big girl. A grown-up. I can handle this. And then she shivered, right before she felt a warm flush spread through her.</p><p>She\u2019d had a week to think about it. It scared her to death, but she wanted to check it out. She would just have to guard her heart with every fiber of strength she had.</p><p>Shaking Ray Anne hadn\u2019t been too hard. He merely stood and said he should get back to work. She concealed her disappointment well, hiding behind her agent\u2019s smile. \u201cI\u2019ll just leave you these papers, because I know you\u2019re going to think about this and change your mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything is possible.\u201d</p><p>When she was gone, he tore up the agreement and made a dinner date with Sarah.</p><p>Cooper took Sarah to a small, family-owned Italian restaurant in Bandon, not too far from Thunder Point but definitely out of the way. There was a pizza counter in the front and twelve booths and four tables in the back. It was kind of dark and strung with plastic grapes and fake greenery. Even though it was a Saturday night, it wasn\u2019t crowded but the pizza counter was busy. Pop was the chef, with a son helping.</p><p>\u201cNice,\u201d Sarah said as she slid into a booth across from Cooper. \u201cVery nice. Just the thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot real fancy,\u201d he pointed out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you, this is what I like. Small, quaint, friendly and hopefully delicious.\u201d</p><p>Of the hundred things Cooper had discovered about this Thunder Point adventure so far, Sarah Dupre was the one that really got his blood pressure up. She looked good enough to eat. \u201cDid you call Landon? Tell him where you\u2019d be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSort of. I texted him that we were going out for Italian. He texted back to have fun and he wouldn\u2019t wait up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmart-ass,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cWonder where he gets that.\u201d</p><p>She ordered a cabernet, he ordered a beer and they pored over old, plastic-covered menus. \u201cGod, I want one of everything,\u201d she said.</p><p>He ordered a calamari appetizer first, then she settled on linguine alla vongole\u2014clams in white sauce\u2014while he ordered cioppino. When the waitress, presumably one of the daughters or daughters-in-law, left, he raised his glass. \u201cTo small, dark, Italian restaurants.\u201d</p><p>She clinked his glass, took a sip and then said, \u201cJust to be clear, I\u2019m not getting involved with a man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe you\u2019ve made that clear several times now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious. I like you, Cooper, but I\u2019m essentially a single mother and just postdivorce. You understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you I understood,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t want you to have any expectations,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cDid I put you through all these protests when you bought me dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not just talking about sex, I mean I\u2019m not in a position to get emotionally involved. I\u2019m not girlfriend material.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSarah, I\u2019m going to say this once\u2014that\u2019s up to you. I\u2019m not worried about whether you get emotionally involved. As long as I get the sex.\u201d At that exact moment, the waitress stood beside their table with the calamari. She hesitated slightly before putting it down. Then she withdrew quickly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>He smiled slyly. Winked. He had done that on purpose.</p><p>Sarah started laughing and her entire face lit up, her dark eyes twinkled, her cheeks turned pink. He had known he wanted her from the first second he saw her, when she came to the trailer and tried to pin his ears back for being Landon\u2019s friend. The truth was, fierce or silly, she turned him on. He really didn\u2019t care whether she got emotionally involved. It might be better for her if she managed to avoid that. But he definitely hoped they could get physically involved.</p> <p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re not getting that, either,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cMmm, wait till you taste this,\u201d he said, chewing a piece of calamari. \u201cThis is so excellent, you might change your mind!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you find this place?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cMac. The man is like a walking Yellow Pages. Anything you need, from mold removal to good restaurant, he\u2019s your man.\u201d He plucked another piece off the plate, but before he put it in his mouth, he asked, \u201cHow in the world did you end up flying for the Coast Guard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t expect to fly, to tell you the truth. I just wanted to be on the water. I had fantasies about rescue swimming, but then I thought, instead of jumping out of the chopper, how about commanding it, flying it. I had no idea whether I\u2019d like it. I did a lot of swimming, diving and sailing growing up, but the highest I\u2019d ever gotten off the ground was a zip-line.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhen did you change your mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn college. I joined a USCG scholarship program when I was nineteen. When I looked at the different places I could go as an officer, I got dazzled by the helicopter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas it the right choice?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cIt was. We\u2019ve had some real adrenaline-pumping missions. Especially out of the Bering Sea.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I was ready for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKodiak was the best experience of my life.\u201d She glowed a little bit when she said that. \u201cIt was my first permanent move with the Coast Guard after flight school. I had lost my parents a year before, had a little six-year-old along for the ride, it was one of the most challenging rescue locations in the U.S., and it was awesome. Sometimes a rescue station is as good as its commander, and ours was incredible. That\u2019s where Landon started playing ball with the commander\u2019s youngest son. Commander Titchke took us under his wing. He not only helped us settle in, and his family helped me with Landon, but he trained me in the Bering Sea. I did things\u2014the team did things\u2014I never imagined we\u2019d do. Once we had two ships taking on water on opposite sides of the island in a storm so violent we couldn\u2019t even drop a line. Seven souls on one, four on another, plus injuries. And we brought them in. It took four crews, it took pulling crew members off vacations or days off, but we saved eleven people that day. Risk management for that operation was tight as I\u2019ve ever seen. There was no room for error or we\u2019d not only lose the vessels and injured, we\u2019d lose the rescue crews. I think my heart pounded for a month.\u201d She took a bite. \u201cI have a lot of stories like that from Kodiak. I could bore you for hours.\u201d</p> <p>He couldn\u2019t help but grin at her. \u201cIt sounds scary fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt gets in your blood, I think. That rush.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou like the edge. You\u2019re a wild woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. I never take unnecessary chances, never. It\u2019s precise and sometimes I can be a perfectionist and...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes?\u201d he asked with a laugh as their salads arrived.</p><p>\u201cI let you eat calamari while I bored you with Coast Guard stories. It\u2019s your turn\u2014tell me about your flying. About Iraq and your civilian gigs.\u201d</p><p>Even though Cooper had gone to Iraq in a Black Hawk right at the beginning of the war, somehow it just didn\u2019t seem as wildly exciting as what Sarah had done, was doing. But he told her about it. He was six years in the Army, then got out to pursue civilian flying. Since work was hard to find, he worked for civilian contractors hired by the U.S. in foreign countries\u2014an expatriate, a mercenary. Eventually, he ended up working for oil companies.</p><p>\u201cWas it good work?\u201d she asked just as their main courses were delivered.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d say so. And the money was good. It was easy work most of the time, good people. And then there was a big oil spill. Major. National news for months, billions of dollars of damage. It made the Valdez look like a dress rehearsal. A couple of the platforms I was flying to shut down\u2014we pulled all the people off. I\u2019ve never seen anything like it. Of course I\u2019d watched news reports of spills before, but there\u2019s nothing like actually seeing it. The company had to downsize and I was more than willing to walk.</p><p>\u201cI worked for two more companies after that, flying to offshore wells, but I couldn\u2019t stop seeing what might happen. It wasn\u2019t my business\u2014I was flying\u2014I didn\u2019t compromise safety. My boss, the chief pilot, didn\u2019t compromise safety. But...\u201d He shook his head. \u201cOnce you see what a major spill can do to a few towns on the coast and a big piece of ocean, it just gets to you. You know?\u201d</p><p>She smiled patiently. \u201cThe Coast Guard is the environment\u2019s friend, Cooper. You know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. So I quit that last job and planned to take a few months off, meet Ben and another friend to hunt in the mountains. I was looking for a break long enough to decide where to go and what to do next. Then everything changed with Ben\u2019s death. I\u2019ll get another flying job,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think it\u2019ll have to be a different kind of flying job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. After Christmas, maybe. After the bar\u2019s looking good and I can sell it. I have to figure out how to deal with that.\u201d</p><p>She grinned. \u201cRay Anne will help you unload it, I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you know?\u201d he asked, because he hadn\u2019t said anything about Ray Anne\u2019s real estate ambitions.</p><p>She gave him a slow smile. \u201cI\u2019m just brilliant, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d he asked. \u201cHow long will you be here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn about a year, I\u2019ll be looking at assignments. Landon will be a senior. If it goes the way we\u2019ve planned, Landon will know where he wants to go to college by then. With any luck, he\u2019ll have an early acceptance. I can manage to sit tight until he graduates. And I\u2019ll try my best not to be too far away.\u201d She looked down at her pasta. \u201cHe\u2019ll need family close enough to visit while he\u2019s in college. It\u2019s different when it\u2019s just two of us.\u201d</p><p>He could only smile at her, give her a nod. She was a remarkable woman. She did a difficult and demanding job, but it didn\u2019t change her first priority\u2014her brother.</p><p>He admired her. That hadn\u2019t happened to him in a long while.</p><p>On her second glass of wine, Sarah forgot to be afraid of her feelings toward Cooper. She experienced a lift in her spirits that she hadn\u2019t felt in too long. She\u2019d been so hurt and angry she\u2019d forgotten how wonderful it was to laugh, to have something in common with a date, to feel friendship growing. To lust, because she was feeling that, too. Her evening with Cooper was perfect. They listened to each other\u2019s work and flying stories intensely, they laughed over foibles and family issues\u2014Cooper had a fairly large extended family and while she had no one to speak of, raising Landon had been worth a laugh or two. They growled in unison when the conversation turned to Jag Morrison and his family. She enjoyed him. He was intelligent, funny and, oh, mama, was he handsome. Although he was mostly flirtatiousness and wit, there was a warmth about him that embraced her.</p><p>And he\u2019d be moving away soon. Perfect.</p><p>The food was delicious, the small restaurant perfect. Sarah realized this was the thing she\u2019d been missing. A companion.</p><p>As they walked out to his truck, she said, \u201cThank you, Cooper. I enjoyed that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. We\u2019ll do it again.\u201d</p><p>She laughed softly. \u201cMy first date since...well, since my ex moved out. Over a year ago.\u201d</p><p>He threaded his fingers through hers. \u201cMy first date in a while, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho was your last date?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He stopped walking. \u201cI have to think. It was probably Judy, a woman I met in Corpus Christi. About a year ago. Interesting woman. But it was one date. I don\u2019t know how to explain why. It just didn\u2019t click.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d she said with a laugh, \u201cI was pretty pissed at our first meeting. And I take this to mean you think we clicked. Or maybe you like angry women? Either that or there aren\u2019t any other women in this town you\u2019ll take a chance on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are plenty of women around,\u201d he said. He touched her cheek with a gentle finger. \u201cIt\u2019s early.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you have in mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome back to my place for a while. It\u2019s not much, but it\u2019s comfortable. Your house is vulnerable\u2014could be teenagers there, taking advantage of the fact that you\u2019re out for the evening. I could make you a cup of coffee. Or a drink.\u201d He shrugged. He grinned. \u201cI\u2019m flexible.\u201d</p><p>Sarah thought, We both know what we want.</p><p>He leaned down to put a soft kiss on her mouth. \u201cTake a chance on me, Sarah. I can play by your rules.\u201d</p><p>It had been so long since a man seemed to know her, know what she needed, wanted. She nodded. \u201cI think a cup of coffee at your place would be all right.\u201d</p><p>Fourteen</p><p>Cooper opened the door to his RV and let Sarah step inside first. He\u2019d left a dim light on over the stove. It cast a gentle glow on the room and when he closed the door, he slipped an arm around her and pulled her close. He placed a soft kiss on her lips. \u201cJust let me get my arms around you for a second and then I\u2019ll make some\u2014\u201d</p><p>She put her hands on his cheeks and pulled his mouth down to hers, cutting him off. Lips touched lips for a mere second before his arms tightened around her and he took her mouth by storm, opening his mouth over hers. A growl came from deep inside him as he went after her. She purred and he groaned. Then he turned with her in his arms and pressed her against the wall just inside the door. Her arms were locked around his neck and he ran a hand over her butt, down the back of her thigh and lifted her leg from behind the knee to his hip, pushing himself against her.</p><p>He was hard that fast. No big surprise. He\u2019d been having hard thoughts all the way home, even though they\u2019d talked and laughed like old friends. This was still completely unplanned, but he thrust his pelvis against hers. And she pushed back.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Sarah...\u201d he murmured against her mouth.</p><p>Her fingers threaded into the short hair over his ears and she clung to him, kissing him deeply, welcoming his tongue. And she whispered, \u201cUh-huh...\u201d</p><p>His hand found a breast, then slipped under her sweater and found more of a breast, though still covered by a lacy bra. He ran a finger around the lace, found her neck with his mouth and kissed, sucked, ran a thumb over her erect nipple. \u201cGod,\u201d he whispered. \u201cJesus. God.\u201d</p><p>She chuckled softly. \u201cAre you praying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God, yes,\u201d he whispered, grinding against her. \u201cOr begging...maybe that\u2019s just begging....\u201d</p><p>He made a study of her neck, ear, temple and chin with his lips, with his tongue, going back to her mouth again and again, growing breathless and crazy. He pushed up her sweater and found that nipple with his lips. And then she slid her arms from around his neck to his waist, from his waist to his butt, pulling him against her. And she hummed.</p><p>He ran that hand over her bottom and down her thigh to that raised knee again, but this time he went all the way to her heel and slid off her boot. Those delicious tight jeans wouldn\u2019t come off over the boot.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she whispered. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>His fingers found the waist of her jeans, the snap, the zipper. He slid a hand inside, lower and lower, until he was feeling a soft tuft of hair and then the damp softness of her. God, she was at least as turned-on as he. Ready, so ready. That\u2019s all it took to have him praying again. But he said, \u201cThis is crazy. Good crazy. So good...\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cCrazy,\u201d she agreed, just as her hands found the snap of his jeans. \u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>Cooper kept telling himself to slow down, to slow way down, to let go and find a place to lay her down, but he couldn\u2019t seem to get past the lust barrier and neither could she. When she lowered his zipper, it got even more desperate and complicated. As she took him in her hand, his head almost exploded and he muttered, \u201cCondom. Condom. Condom.\u201d</p> <p>He had to let go of her briefly to get into his back pocket. He fumbled to find the condom, but once it was in his hand, she took it away from him. \u201cLet me,\u201d she said. But she took her time with him, enjoying him for a while, stroking him, kissing him all the while.</p><p>\u201cSarah,\u201d he begged. \u201cGet on with it. Please.\u201d</p><p>She suited him up, then slid her leg down from his hip. He gently but a little desperately lowered her jeans, pulling off one leg, then the other. He probed her with his fingers then lifted her off the ground, her back against the wall. A million possible endearments ran through his head. But he said, \u201cHelp.\u201d</p><p>She threaded her hand between their bodies, found him, helped him find his way inside. He was half out of his mind and long past thinking logically; he slid in and gave a deep groan. She, on the other hand, gave a rather loud \u201cAhh!\u201d He held her still and fast for a long moment. Then, holding her up under her thighs, he began to move, every thrust bringing him closer to an insane, brainless ecstasy. He thought about saying he was sorry, that he\u2019d make it up to her later, but then she cried out. Her legs tightened around him, her internal muscles clenched and pulled the most amazing orgasm out of him as she came. And came. Her arms locked around his neck; she moaned in pleasure; she held him so tight as he plunged into her again and again and again. It was a long time before all that pelvic action slowed then stopped. Cooper was completely out of breath; his knees went weak. She was panting and holding on for dear life.</p><p>\u201cBaby,\u201d he said in a desperate whisper. \u201cPlease don\u2019t move.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d She sighed.</p><p>\u201cJust don\u2019t move,\u201d he said again. \u201cYou could break off meaningful parts....\u201d</p><p>She sighed again, nuzzling, kissing his cheek.</p><p>\u201cHoney...Sarah...I\u2019m sorry, baby....\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry?\u201d she asked weakly.</p><p>\u201cJesus, I took you. Against the wall. In three minutes. And you still have your jacket on.\u201d</p> <p>She was quiet a moment. \u201cThat\u2019s a relief. I thought I took you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat, too. My God. Don\u2019t move. That was... I can\u2019t even describe that. It was... Jeez.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting a little uncomfortable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSoon,\u201d he said. He kissed her neck, then her lips. \u201cSoon.\u201d He kissed her again, with passion. \u201cAh, Sarah. I\u2019m surprised I have legs. I\u2019ve never...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever? You certainly acted like you knew what you were doing. Come on, Cooper. I have to get down now. Please?\u201d</p><p>He pulled his head back just slightly to look down at them. Her jacket hung off one shoulder, her sweater pushed up over her breasts, and she was naked from the waist down. His sweater was askew, his shirttails hanging out, and his pants drooped. He laughed. \u201cWe look like we just survived a hurricane.\u201d He lifted her up a bit, let her drop her legs to the ground. But he kept his hands on her bare butt. \u201cNo coffee tonight, baby. Bed. We have to go to bed.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help but laugh at him. \u201cWhat if I don\u2019t want to go to bed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019ll be getting real familiar with this wall.\u201d He hoisted up his pants but didn\u2019t bother zipping. Then he bent down, grabbed her jeans in one hand and scooped her up in his arms. He carried her up the three steps to his bedroom, putting her down on the bed. He helped her out of her jacket, removed his and said, \u201cDon\u2019t go anywhere. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d And he left the room.</p> <p>The bathroom was very close to the bedroom, of course. Everything was close to everything\u2014it was a trailer. While he was in the bathroom, she yelled, \u201cI\u2019m feeling a little...exposed here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet under the covers,\u201d he yelled back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019m in the mood for that. What if I want coffee?\u201d</p><p>He walked back into the room. Hands on his hips, jeans still unzipped, he loomed over her. He smiled at her. \u201cYou know what I realized about thirty seconds after opening the door tonight? You didn\u2019t want coffee.\u201d Then he pulled his sweater over his head.</p><p>\u201cNow what?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He reached for the hem of her sweater and pulled it off. \u201cI want to hold you. And maybe try regular sex, if the spirit moves us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d she asked, automatically unhooking her bra and tossing it.</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d he said, getting rid of his boots and pants. \u201cThe plain old regular but excellent kind, complete with foreplay, which we didn\u2019t get to before. No danger of back injury or broken bones, but very good just the same.\u201d He pulled the covers back and she twisted into them. He crawled in beside her and pulled her into his arms. \u201cAlthough, what we just did...I think that was one of the best things I\u2019ve ever done. Or one of the best things that\u2019s ever been done to me. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any way to top it.\u201d He pulled her closer, kissed her cheek, running his big callused hand over her soft skin.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m feeling a little unsure of myself,\u201d she said, snuggling closer to him. \u201cI\u2019ve never done this before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Vanilla sex?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSex without any commitment at all. I mean, I\u2019ve had plenty of sex, don\u2019t get me wrong. Okay, not plenty...not that much, actually. But I always thought it was going somewhere. That there was love. Or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, don\u2019t write me off so fast,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cMaybe in about an hour and a half, you\u2019ll think you love me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m afraid of that\u2014I don\u2019t ever want to be in love again. I can\u2019t get involved, you know that. For a hundred reasons. I\u2019m vulnerable. I just got divorced. I have major responsibilities. But I\u2019ve never even considered something like this before\u2014sex with someone I like, but without any emotional investment.\u201d</p><p>And, Cooper thought, that was the only kind he\u2019d ever had. He was usually the one to say I can\u2019t get involved. He\u2019d had a lot of logical reasons, some like hers. He was being deployed or transferred, moving, just broke up with someone, you name it. There were a couple of times he had forgotten to say he couldn\u2019t get involved and he\u2019d ended up engaged, wondering what the hell had happened. But he\u2019d never really been in love. Not even close. And here he was, suddenly wondering what that would feel like. Wondering what he\u2019d been missing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure I know what to do,\u201d she said.</p><p>He ran his fingers through the short hair over her temple. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to know anything, honey. You just have to be yourself, be honest, tell me what you need and let it happen naturally. I\u2019m not going to try to trip you up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t have...expectations?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t use me for sex and then just turn your back on me? Suddenly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m not a bad guy. We wouldn\u2019t be together right now if we didn\u2019t like each other. I never turn my back on a friend. No matter what.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can trust you, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can trust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t be with other women while you\u2019re with me? Because I\u2019d have to kill you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t do that. I might not be a settling-down kind of guy, but I\u2019m definitely a one-woman-at-a-time kind of guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all I want right now\u2014to be the only woman with a guy who I like and who I trust. A friend. Oh, man, don\u2019t ever let me have two glasses of wine again,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t blame the wine,\u201d he said.</p><p>She tilted her head and smiled into his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I\u2019m just so tired of not having a friend. And because...well, that up-against-the-wall thing is one of the best things that ever happened to me.\u201d</p><p>He smiled back, the corners of his eyes crinkling. \u201cI\u2019ll have to start lifting weights, so I\u2019m sure to keep you happy.\u201d Then his smile vanished and he kissed her. \u201cRight now, I think we should try the old-fashioned kind\u2014no trapeze, no props, no 6.8 difficulty.\u201d</p><p>She slid her hand down his belly and found out what he was talking about. She closed her hand around him and his eyes rolled back in his head. He wanted her again. Bad.</p><p>Sarah wasn\u2019t the first woman Cooper had been involved with who had kids. There hadn\u2019t been many\u2014and there\u2019d never been one with a sixteen-year-old at home\u2014but he didn\u2019t have to be told how important it was that she set an example for Landon.</p><p>He pulled up in front of her house at eleven-thirty. Landon\u2019s truck was already in the carport beside her SUV.</p><p>\u201cDo I look like I just had a fattening dinner and a couple of hours of wonderful sex?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>Cooper lifted her chin and turned her face to and fro. \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t look into your eyes, you\u2019re safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSwell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he recognizes that flush and glow, it\u2019s time to have another one of those sex talks with him,\u201d Cooper suggested.</p><p>\u201cHe says if I bring up safe and responsible sex one more time, he\u2019s running away from home.\u201d</p><p>Cooper laughed at her. \u201cYou\u2019ll be fine.\u201d He gave her a brief kiss. \u201cSweet dreams.\u201d</p><p>He watched her go into the house before he drove away across the beach. The sand was hard packed close to the hill. There were a few people on the beach, sitting close to a campfire. He wasn\u2019t sure if they were kids or adults\u2014he didn\u2019t see any all-terrain vehicles or motorcycles. But he wasn\u2019t worried. In fact, it gave him a good feeling to have someone using the beach.</p><p>When he went inside the trailer, the first thing he noticed was her scent. He wasn\u2019t sure if she\u2019d left it behind or if it was still on his breath, his tongue. The place seemed oddly empty without her there.</p><p>He cracked open a beer and went to his bedroom, sitting on the rumpled sheets, flicking on the TV. But he didn\u2019t watch. He thought about Sarah and the way her body felt beneath his hands, the way he felt inside her. Her laugh. Her sarcasm. That\u2019s a relief. I thought I took you. Her sincerity and honesty. She wanted to have a relationship without strings, but didn\u2019t really know how. Ha. He was so glad he hadn\u2019t confessed that seemed to be the only kind he knew how to have.</p><p>He wanted her with him tonight, through the night. He\u2019d wanted plenty of women, but there was something fresh about this time. It was new. It was deep. There wasn\u2019t anything confusing about it\u2014it was honest. He could already feel her hooks in him. He was an expert at not caring deeply, yet this time it wasn\u2019t working for him. He wanted her in every way\u2014physically, intellectually, emotionally. And she didn\u2019t want him back in that way. In fact, she needed his help in remaining unattached.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d he said aloud to no one. \u201cI\u2019m screwed.\u201d</p><p>The last football game for Thunder Point High School was a home game and the night was mild and clear. The McCain contingent occupied their fifty yard line seats, but this time Sarah was included with Cooper and Gina had convinced her mom to come. Carrie was a huge supporter of the team, and good friends with Lou, but running a deli and catering service required that she be up by four in the morning for baking and cooking and it was rare that she stayed up past eight in the evening.</p><p>There was lots of laughter, chatter and cheering, but Gina was aware almost instantly that the relationship between Sarah and Cooper had grown more serious. At first it was just in the way he looked at her. It was as if the very sight of her made Cooper happy. While Sarah stared out at the field, watching her brother play, Cooper would throw a long glance her way and his lips would curve in a secret smile while his eyes got a little dreamy. And before long, Gina saw him reach for her hand, hold it, give it a squeeze. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>It was with that simple action that Gina felt her throat close and her eyes cloud.</p><p>They\u2019d known each other for what? A few weeks? A couple of months? Of course they were bonded over Landon\u2019s problems, but they weren\u2019t attracted to each other because of Sarah\u2019s brother. Gina wondered how deep, how intense the relationship was now, but of course she couldn\u2019t ask. In fact, learning this way, at a raucous football game, was a blessing; no one would notice that she was so envious she could have wept. By halftime, when Cooper and Mac wandered off to stretch their legs, leaving the women, she was composed again.</p> <p>Gina turned to Sarah and said, \u201cWhen did that happen? You and Cooper?\u201d</p><p>Sarah shrugged. \u201cA week, maybe ten days ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like him,\u201d Carrie said.</p><p>\u201cGood man, Cooper,\u201d Lou said.</p><p>Gina leaned close to Sarah\u2019s ear and asked, \u201cNext level?\u201d</p> <p>Before Sarah could even think about answering, Carrie said, \u201cGina!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn, she\u2019s got the ears of a bloodhound,\u201d Gina said.</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s none of your business,\u201d Carrie said. \u201cBesides, it\u2019s obvious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is?\u201d Sarah and Gina said in unison.</p><p>With a wave of her hand, Carrie said, \u201cIt\u2019s in the touch, the look, just the energy. Go ahead and deny it, Sarah.\u201d</p><p>To Gina\u2019s surprise, Sarah only laughed. \u201cWe\u2019re just friends,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s very comfortable but not serious.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAh, friends with benefits,\u201d Carrie said. \u201cThe modern way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly,\u201d Sarah said. \u201cWe\u2019re dating, that\u2019s all. Cooper completely understands that a serious or even potentially serious relationship is out of the question for me. I\u2019ve been divorced less than a year. My first priorities are Landon and my job and, believe me, I\u2019m in no way ready to get involved in anything long-term. Too risky for me. My wounds are still a little fresh. And Cooper...? Well, he makes no secret about the fact that he has a few things to do here and then he\u2019ll be leaving. He\u2019s been doing the internet-job-search thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the beach?\u201d Gina asked.</p><p>\u201cHe hasn\u2019t decided. But he\u2019s a helicopter pilot, military first and then civilian. There aren\u2019t any helicopter jobs around here outside of the Coast Guard. He\u2019s leaving, girls. And you know what? That makes him kind of safe for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless you accidentally fall in love with him,\u201d Gina said.</p><p>\u201cI already love him, but not in that typical romantic way. Not the way I fell for my ex before I knew he was a cruel, selfish bastard. I love the way Cooper keeps an eye out for my brother, love the way he makes me laugh, love that I can trust his friendship. And in two or three months, we\u2019re not going to live in the same town, but if we\u2019re still good friends, maybe we\u2019ll stay in touch. Right now, all I want is a nice guy to go to dinner with sometimes and who will hold my hand in public. That\u2019s all I want. All I have room for in my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFling?\u201d Lou asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to put a label on it. We could decide this is not the best idea in two weeks. Or we could stumble along for a while. We did make a promise to each other\u2014that if it wasn\u2019t the right thing for one of us and we had to step away, there would be no drama. I\u2019m not going to hold a man hostage. No way.\u201d</p> <p>It hit Gina hard and suddenly. She would take any part of that, any little part. A date, a little hand-holding, some late-night chats on the phone, whatever. She\u2019d go along with that whole \u201cnot serious\u201d thing if that\u2019s all there was.</p><p>But it was Lou who asked, \u201cThink you can stick to that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she said. \u201cRight now if I went out with a man who was looking for a wife or even a live-in partner, I\u2019d run for my life. We\u2019ll go out some night, a girl\u2019s night, and I\u2019ll tell you about the ex, the cheating bastard who dumped me and my brother after less than a year.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cNot easy for me to trust men now. Just the fact that I trust Cooper\u2019s friendship is a big step.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Lou said. \u201cShe can stick to it.\u201d</p><p>It was only a few moments before the men were back with snacks and everything in the conversation changed as they waited for the second half to start. Except for one thing. Gina thought she had a better grasp of Mac\u2019s fear of relationships. It must be a little like Sarah\u2019s, but with a lot more tenacity\u2014his wife had left him ten years ago. She knew all about his ex-wife\u2019s betrayal. Not from Mac, though he\u2019d mentioned a few details, but from Lou, whose anger over what Cee Jay had done to her family was enormous and frightening.</p><p>The game was won by a landslide, Landon once again the star. The parents had all been warned that there would be celebrating tonight, closing off football for the season. Everyone grabbed their bleacher cushions, lap blankets, coolers and trash and headed out. But Gina stayed for a moment. She remembered being a high school sophomore, sitting right here on these bleachers. The games were thrilling, the crowds of kids even more so. The forbidden parties afterward were electrifying. Gina had a boyfriend who hung out with a lot of Thunder Point High kids, but he wasn\u2019t a student. He\u2019d dropped out the year before and was an auto mechanic in Bandon, which made him dangerous and arousing. He liked the games and after-parties; he liked the girls, fast driving and late nights. And Gina\u2014he liked Gina. She held him off for their first five secret dates and then gave in and got pregnant.</p><p>When she told her boyfriend, he split. Moved. Bolted. She heard he went to Idaho to work. A few years later his parents moved away from Thunder Point, into a seniors\u2019 community near their married daughter and grandchildren. All ties were broken. Hell, there hadn\u2019t been any ties! No one had even acknowledged that Ashley was his child.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t gone to another high school football game until Ashley began cheering.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Mac called from several seats below. \u201cComing?\u201d</p><p>Not in years, she wanted to say. Instead, she said, \u201cComing.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s not as though Gina hadn\u2019t realized before tonight that she had no romantic partner in her life. Never had. She\u2019d had a few meaningless dates that had never shown potential and one big heartthrob who kept her at arm\u2019s length.</p><p>Mac put out his hand as she stepped down the bleachers and she let him help her. They walked together toward the parking lot.</p><p>\u201cGood game,\u201d he said.</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait to see what that kid does next year,\u201d Mac said. \u201cDupre. He\u2019s some ball player.\u201d</p><p>Her buddy, Mac, she thought. Her pal.</p><p>\u201cHey, what\u2019s up with you? You\u2019re quiet.\u201d</p><p>She stopped walking and looked up at him. She thought, This has gone on long enough. I have to get on with my life. He\u2019s never going to be mine. \u201cHeadache,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cToo much noise?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe kids are all going out. Lou can take Dee Dee and Ryan home. How bad is that headache? We could grab a beer and still be home by curfew.\u201d</p><p>And then I can go home and fall asleep to that old fantasy that we might be more than pals? When it\u2019s never going to happen? \u201cMaybe another time, Mac. I\u2019m working in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d he asked. \u201cWe could get you an aspirin or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I need my bed.\u201d They got to the parking lot and she veered off toward her car. Carrie stood there, talking with Lou, waiting for her.</p><p>\u201cSee you later, then,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cLater,\u201d she answered. And later and later and later and later...</p><p>The next morning, Gina cursed the doorbell. It was eleven o\u2019clock. Carrie was at the deli, Ashley had gone shopping with Eve, Gina was finally alone and desperately needed to be. She had held her wrecked emotions inside until she could have some space, some privacy. She ignored the doorbell, but it rang again and again. With her red nose and watering eyes, she finally threw her ratty old robe over her pajamas and opened the door to meanly tell the stupid SOB who was leaning on the bell to get off her porch.</p><p>\u201cHi. You okay?\u201d Mac asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d she shot back.</p><p>\u201cYou called in sick to the diner. You never call in sick.\u201d He peered at her closely. \u201cGod, you look awful.\u201d</p><p>She glared at him. \u201cThanks so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to take you to the doctor? Do you have a fever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! It\u2019s a cold, it\u2019ll pass! But I\u2019m not feeling like company.\u201d</p><p>He pushed his way inside. \u201cI\u2019ll make you some tea or soup or something. You go lay on the couch. Did your headache turn into a cold? Must\u2019ve been sinus or something. Maybe I should get some soup from Carrie.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. Oh, God, she internally wailed. Just what she needed\u2014Mac. And Mac at the deli, looking for chicken soup? Carrie, who left for work before dawn, had no idea Gina was staying home, claiming a cold. She was supposed to be having a richly deserved self-pity party! This was her only chance. She sank down onto the couch and pressed a tissue up to her face. \u201cMac, all I really need is to sleep.\u201d</p><p>He stepped back into the living room, holding a can of chicken soup\u2014Chicken &amp; Stars, not something the owner of a deli would brag about. \u201cI could warm this up for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you,\u201d she said. \u201cPlease go. Before you breathe my air and get sick.\u201d</p><p>He sat down in the chair across the small room from her, transferring the can from hand to hand. He just looked at her for a moment. She blew her nose. She tried a little cough.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not sick,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re crying. Why are you crying? What happened? Who did this to you?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head and in spite of her determination, her eyes welled with unshed tears. She was not going to talk to him about this! \u201cMac, it\u2019s very personal. Please. Don\u2019t push.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what is it?\u201d he asked again, leaning toward her, his elbows on his knees, gripping the soup can. \u201cIs Ashley in trouble? Is Carrie all right? Did someone hurt you? Do you need money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, for God\u2019s sake! No! No! No! Will you leave this alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen you cry. Tell me, Gina.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re pissing me off!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCooper and Sarah were holding hands at the game!\u201d she blurted. Then she dropped her head into her hands. \u201cDamn it. Damn it. Damn it!\u201d</p><p>Mac was silent. She lifted her head, wiped off her eyes and nose with the tissue and saw by his expression that he was stunned. \u201cYou have a thing for Cooper?\u201d he asked quietly.</p><p>She just looked at him in wonder. She shook her head. \u201cNo, Mac, I don\u2019t have a thing for Cooper. I haven\u2019t had a date in five years. I saw Sarah and Cooper holding hands and it hit me\u2014they\u2019ve only known each other a few weeks. And I\u2019m alone. Way too alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not alone, Gina. You have your mom, your daughter, friends...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an idiot.\u201d She stood up. \u201cAnd now you have to go because at this moment I want to be alone!\u201d She went to the front door and opened it.</p><p>Mac slowly stood. \u201cI don\u2019t think I understand what\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you don\u2019t. Gimme that soup,\u201d she said, snatching it from his hand.</p><p>\u201cI thought, if you\u2019re not sick, maybe you want to go out tonight. It\u2019s Lou\u2019s bunco night, but Eve can watch the kids and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m busy,\u201d she said, cutting him off. \u201cMaybe another time. Now if you don\u2019t mind...\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, Gina,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cSee you later,\u201d she said. \u201cNice of you to check on me. Bye.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cGina...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, really, Mac. Goodbye.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you mad at me?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m mad at the world! Now get out of here before I call the cops!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am the cops. I think you\u2019re losing it, Gina. Get a grip,\u201d he said. But he left.</p><p>And she threw herself on her bed and cried.</p><p>Fifteen</p> <p>When the door from the garage opened, Lou was standing in the kitchen, ready to leave for the evening. \u201cI thought you\u2019d never get home. Where have you been all day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI checked in,\u201d he reminded her.</p><p>\u201cYes, but I didn\u2019t realize ordering a cord of firewood, checking your messages at the office and taking a look at the progress on Cooper\u2019s bar was going to eat up six hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I making you late?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, not yet.\u201d</p><p>He sat down at the kitchen table. \u201cEve staying home tonight?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s her plan, but I think the boyfriend is coming over. You\u2019re okay with that, right? I\u2019m going out to dinner with my bunco partner. If I have more than a glass and a half of wine, I might stay over. I\u2019ll text you so I don\u2019t wake you with a ringing phone. And if I do spend the night, I\u2019ll be home in the morning, first thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust enjoy yourself,\u201d he said. \u201cListen, you got a minute?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. I might even have ten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan this be between us? I think it\u2019s personal. Don\u2019t talk to Carrie about it, all right?\u201d</p><p>It was the look on his face more than his request that had her sitting down at the table with him. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure. Gina wasn\u2019t at the diner this morning. Stu said she called in sick, so I went to her house to check on her. She said she had a cold, but she didn\u2019t have a cold. She was crying. And she was angry. Mad as hell. When I asked her what was wrong, she said Cooper and Sarah were holding hands. So I asked her if she had a crush on Cooper and she called me an idiot and asked me to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Mac,\u201d Lou said. \u201cYou\u2019re such an idiot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow see, this is obviously some female language I don\u2019t get. How does that make me an idiot?\u201d</p> <p>Lou leaned her chin on her hand. \u201cMac, do you think she\u2019s going to wait for you forever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d he asked stupidly.</p><p>\u201cThis town is amazing, isn\u2019t it? The way we talk about everything and nothing? Some gossip takes about thirty seconds to spread worldwide and some things are kept almost religiously secret. You and Gina, Mac. Best friends for years. Closer than brother and sister. More fond than lovers. And yet, it goes nowhere? No two people more right for each other, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re parents, Lou. We\u2019re friends because the kids are friends. It would be a mistake to complicate that.\u201d</p><p>She just shook her head. \u201cWe should\u2019ve talked about this years ago. It wouldn\u2019t be very complicated, given the fact that you know each other better than a lot of married couples. What\u2019s taking you so long? You\u2019re crazy about her. And there\u2019s absolutely no doubt she\u2019s crazy about you. Neither of you has been even tempted by anyone else.\u201d</p><p>He squirmed in his chair. That in itself was telling\u2014this great, big, muscled, fearless guy, fidgeting awkwardly. \u201cHistory, that\u2019s what\u2019s keeping us from dating. You should understand that better than anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, I\u2019m a little confused. What history?\u201d</p><p>He gave a short, humorless laugh. \u201cHow about she was dumped by the father of her baby and I was dumped by the mother of my children? That good enough? We might be a couple of people with good reason to be careful!\u201d</p><p>Lou just looked at him for a long moment. \u201cShe was fifteen,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd you? You were only nineteen when you married your pregnant girlfriend and she was... Oh, don\u2019t even make me go there. I have a good idea she knew exactly what she was doing. I know it\u2019s an optimistic stretch, but you and Gina have probably grown up a lot since then. You\u2019re obviously attracted to each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if we dated and didn\u2019t like each other?\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll always like each other. What if you dated and realized you weren\u2019t meant to be a couple? Grown-ups deal with that without rancor. But right now what you\u2019ve got is a woman who has waited for you to make a move for years. Her frustration must be beyond words. And we all know you don\u2019t have another woman anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe? Who, we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe whole stupid town,\u201d she said. \u201cSeriously, Mac. There are hardly any secrets around here\u2014no one should know that better than you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, now wait a minute. If everyone thinks we\u2019re meant for each other and this close to getting together, why is she crying after years of friendship? Which, by the way, we agreed was the best thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? You both decided? Somehow I doubt that was Gina\u2019s idea. But I\u2019ll give you the benefit of the doubt and assume it was. Then the reason for her tears would be this\u2014Sarah and Cooper hit town, meet in an extremely complicated way, are attracted to each other and, without overthinking it, form some kind of relationship. One that puts a shine in both their eyes. Gina must have wondered what she\u2019s done wrong. She might be thinking you don\u2019t find her attractive or appealing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2014\u201d He didn\u2019t finish.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that you screwed up at the age of nineteen, no pun intended, and you still can\u2019t let yourself off the hook for it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt left me with quite a load\u2014three kids and an opinionated aunt,\u201d he said, lifting an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cWell, we\u2019ve done pretty damn well with the spoils,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve kept it all under control for years. Our kids are doing very well. Here\u2019s what I think you should do, Deputy Yummy Pants. I think you should weigh how damn lucky you are that a woman as solid and beautiful and wonderful as Gina would even consider you. Most men don\u2019t get a chance like that in a lifetime. And it sounds like she\u2019s had just about enough.\u201d</p><p>He just stared at her. \u201cI might need a beer,\u201d he finally said. He pushed back his chair but she got up, got him a bottle of beer from the refrigerator and sat back down. He twisted off the cap and took a drink. \u201cWhat if I let her down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never let anyone down in your life. You\u2019ve been let down. In spades. But you\u2019ve always lived up to your commitments.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLou, I wasn\u2019t happy.\u201d He nearly whispered it, as if it was the deepest secret of all. \u201cI wanted to marry Cee Jay, and I was miserable. I don\u2019t want to risk that again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. By now you should know what makes you happy.\u201d She shook her head and laughed. \u201cTalk about the pink elephant in the living room! Has no one ever asked you why you\u2019re not hooked up with Gina?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one,\u201d he said. \u201cNever.\u201d</p><p>She tsked and shook her head. \u201cAmazing. Well, you should think about all this before she gets away from you. If I were Gina, I\u2019d be asking myself why I\u2019m wasting my time. I\u2019d sign on to a dating service.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgain?\u201d he asked, and smiled.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know anything. And I have to get going,\u201d she said, standing. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk about this again after you\u2019ve had time to think. And listen, don\u2019t let Eve go over to Landon\u2019s house tonight. Sarah is working all weekend\u2014sitting on call for emergencies or something in North Bend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said. \u201cCooper mentioned that. So. You always look so nice for bunco.\u201d</p><p>She sat down. She hated this. But Lou was, if anything, fair. It was time to be honest with Mac. \u201cI\u2019m not going to play bunco. I\u2019m going to meet my secret boyfriend who is ten years younger than I am, a different race than me, and happens to work with you on occasion.\u201d</p><p>Mac smiled at her. \u201cI know. Joe. Nice guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe told you?\u201d she asked, horrified.</p><p>\u201cI followed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou what?\u201d</p><p>He gave a shrug. \u201cI couldn\u2019t remember ever hearing of these women you were playing bunco with in Coquille, so I followed you. I wanted to be sure you were safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, for Jesus\u2019 sake,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just ask me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you didn\u2019t want to talk about it and, unlike you, I was letting you hold on to your privacy. And I\u2019m willing to bet you\u2019ve never seen Dancing with the Stars or the reruns you lock yourself in your room to watch. I can hear you talking on your phone. And giggling.\u201d</p><p>She leaned toward him and leveled him with her mean-aunt look. \u201cIf you\u2019re such a damn smart detective, how is it you don\u2019t know you\u2019re in love with Gina?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me tell you something you probably already know. When Cee Jay got pregnant, even though we were kids with hardly an income between us, I was the happiest kid alive. Wanna know why? Because I was going to get to have sex without hiding in the backseat of a car every night for the rest of my life. That\u2019s what I thought love was, and it was a disaster. My life went to hell. I\u2019m a tough guy\u2014I can take it. But I can\u2019t stand the idea of putting Gina or the kids through something like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMac...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you, Lou? You\u2019ve dated before. Plenty. Why are you hiding this one? Is it because Joe\u2019s black?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not. I like him so much, but I want you and the kids to have no doubt that I\u2019m planning to stick this out, see everyone grown-up and on their own. And by the time I do that, I\u2019ll be seventy. Seventy, Mac. Joe might change his mind.\u201d</p><p>Mac smiled at her. \u201cI bet most of this town thinks two of the most self-assured people here are you and I. I\u2019m afraid of going after a girl and you\u2019re afraid some guy will dump you for getting older. Which, by the way, is going to happen to him, too\u2014getting older, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot as fast,\u201d she said grimly. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about a face-lift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the best-looking fifty-year-old in town.\u201d</p><p>She smiled broadly. \u201cThanks, Mac. Really, thanks. Since I\u2019m sixty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Lou let herself into Joe\u2019s house and found him in the kitchen, chopping vegetables for a salad. She leaned in the doorway and just took him in\u2014so tall and broad, his bald head shiny and latte-colored. He had the most wonderful eyebrows\u2014black, arched, expressive.</p><p>He looked up and smiled. \u201cHello, beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, we\u2019re staying in,\u201d she said. \u201cYou cooked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bought a roasted chicken from the grocery, and I\u2019m making a salad. Glass of wine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA double, please. He knows, Joe. Mac knows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I didn\u2019t tell him, although I wanted to.\u201d He grabbed the chilled white out of the refrigerator and a glass from the cupboard. \u201cDid you tell him?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cApparently he\u2019s known for months. He followed me to one of my bunco games.\u201d</p><p>Joe laughed. \u201cThat dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe asked me if I\u2019m hiding you because you\u2019re black.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously? People hardly give a biracial couple a second glance. Did you tell him you\u2019re hiding me because I sometimes work with him?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI told him the truth.\u201d She took a sip of her wine. \u201cI told him it\u2019s because I love you and I\u2019m afraid by the time I\u2019m done raising my kids, his kids, I\u2019ll be almost seventy. And you\u2019ll finally come to your senses. When it\u2019s too late for me to get over you.\u201d</p><p>His lips curled in a smile and he came around the work island to face her. He put his hands on her slender waist. \u201cI should be annoyed by that, you know. That you keep expecting me to bail out on you because of something as trivial as age. But I\u2019m not. Know why?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I don\u2019t mind convincing you that\u2019s idiotic. Bring that glass of wine to bed.\u201d</p> <p>They walked together toward the bedroom, holding hands. Lou said, \u201cI\u2019m sixty, been single all my life. I\u2019ve had a few serious crushes that I thought might turn into something, but here I am, in love for the first time. At my age.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Stop complaining.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOlder people can get sick, you know. You could end up caring for some old woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI pulled a speeding car over last night. A man was rushing his wife to the hospital. She\u2019d been diagnosed with cancer, had been sick on and off for a few years and was getting worse. She was having trouble breathing, had chest pains and he thought it might be an embolism. He thought he was losing her. She was thirty-two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, the poor things...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI lit it up and escorted them to the hospital. Let\u2019s let that age thing you\u2019re always worrying about go, Lou. Let\u2019s just have us some fun, now that Mac knows. All right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFun. Right.\u201d She slid her hand up his chest to his shoulder. \u201cWhat are you doing for Thanksgiving in two weeks? Will you be with your kids this year?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne is going skiing with friends and the other is spending the holiday with her mother and stepfather.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you like to make your debut?\u201d</p><p>He grinned at her. \u201cSounds like a plan.\u201d</p><p>Thanksgiving Day, the weather was clear, wind moderate, temperature in the low forties on the Pacific, lower in the mountains where it was snowing. Sarah was at work until four o\u2019clock, at which time she would head out of North Bend for Thunder Point and her boss would take over command. On holidays they tried to divide the watch. Crews of pilots, maintenance and EMTs would work the day shift, and the folks that had the day shift off would have their holiday meal early and come in later.</p> <p>The station was quiet. This was a busy place Monday through Friday, when so much support staff, from clerical to maintenance, populated the place. But on nights, weekends and holidays, they operated with a slightly smaller workforce for emergencies. There were no training flights or inspections; Sarah wouldn\u2019t fly unless there was a rescue mission. She used her time catching up on officer efficiency reports, schedules for training flights and inventory of her helicopters. The helicopters had been put through the preflight checklists, gassed and were ready to go.</p><p>She was at her desk but kept looking at her watch, more than ready to call this workday over.</p><p>\u201cSarah.\u201d</p><p>She looked up and saw her ex-husband standing in the doorway. \u201cYou\u2019re early,\u201d she said, looking at her watch again. He wasn\u2019t due for an hour.</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d offer you an early out for the holiday. Do you have plans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d she said, putting down her pen and leaning back in her chair. \u201cI\u2019m having dinner with friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Landon?\u201d</p><p>She lifted her brows. \u201cThe same friends,\u201d she answered.</p> <p>\u201cI guess Thunder Point is working out?\u201d Derek asked. \u201cYou seem happier.\u201d</p><p>She just gave a nod, but she couldn\u2019t help thinking about how much happier than she\u2019d been in so long. There were a couple of very dark years until now, from the time she had been forced to acknowledge Derek\u2019s cheating, through the extended, black process of freeing herself when all she\u2019d really wanted was for him to love her more than anything, more than anyone. When she looked at him now, she could summon that pain and disappointment. Of course, if she tried, she could find that rage and humiliation again. But it was hard now. Landon was happy with Eve, hanging out with friends and the McCain family. And she had Cooper, who was safe.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking, Sarah,\u201d Derek said. \u201cMaybe over the holidays, we could get together. You and me and Landon. Last year wasn\u2019t good. It was\u2014\u201d</p><p>She laughed at him before he could finish. \u201cOur divorce was final three days before Christmas. No, Derek, we\u2019re not going to spend holidays together.\u201d She didn\u2019t bother to tell him it had been the worst Christmas of her life, rivaled only by the Christmas right after her parents died.</p><p>He stepped into the room. He straightened. \u201cI\u2019d like to see Landon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has the same cell phone number he\u2019s had for the past two years, but I\u2019m going to go out on a limb here and say that he won\u2019t be interested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought maybe you\u2019d tell him I might be calling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMight? Might? You seriously want me to tell Landon his long-lost brother-in-law might be calling him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to be long and lost,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just seemed kinder to Landon not to put him in the middle of our problems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDerek, no one put him there and he was in the middle of it. You know that. When you were unfaithful to the marriage, you were unfaithful to him, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe really need to have a conversation about\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cJust no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, I think enough time has passed for us to have a conversation, maybe mend some fences.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not going to talk about this here. This is work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you have dinner with me? Meet me for a drink?\u201d he asked. \u201cSometime between now and Christmas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d she said, standing. She briefly remembered how attractive and sexy she\u2019d once found him. He had been irresistible. If she\u2019d known about his little problem with monogamy, she not only wouldn\u2019t have married him, she would never have gone on a date with him. \u201cWe weren\u2019t right for each other, we ended it as well as we could, it\u2019s over. Landon is getting his confidence back and seems happy. Let\u2019s just try to be professional.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSarah, I heard through the grapevine that I\u2019m getting orders. Is that your doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy doing?\u201d she asked, stunned. Then she laughed. \u201cDerek, if I could work a deal like that, I\u2019d have done it a year and a half ago! Where are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKodiak,\u201d he said, completely glum.</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch,\u201d she muttered. He didn\u2019t want to go. She knew he didn\u2019t like to be cold, to sleep in daylight, to be challenged too much. She\u2019d give just about anything to be reassigned to Kodiak, to the Bering Sea.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll be out of here in a few months or less. I want to be friends, to see Landon, to\u2014\u201d</p><p>She came around her desk. She was shaking her head. \u201cYou\u2019re way too late, Derek. You\u2019d have to unscrew a whole bunch of women, to start with. And you never said goodbye to Landon\u2014he\u2019s not feeling real brotherly toward you. In fact, he\u2019s pretty pissed, and not just because of what you did to me. You left him, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, you didn\u2019t exactly make me feel welcome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sorry,\u201d she said sarcastically. \u201cI\u2019m not going to discuss this with you, especially not here. No dinner, no drink, and I don\u2019t give a shit about your fences. You made your choice. Your fences are all beyond repair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSarah,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have influence. People like you, respect you. Can you get me out of Kodiak?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d take it off your hands in a second if I could. But I have commitments. I\u2019m determined that Landon will graduate from his current high school.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her for a long moment. \u201cOh, man, I missed all the signals!\u201d he said suddenly. Then he laughed. \u201cYou\u2019ve been smiling lately\u2014you\u2019ve been less mean. You\u2019re in a relationship!\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t flinch. \u201cLast count, you\u2019re in twenty relationships. Derek, I am so done with you. If you\u2019re ready to take over, I\u2019ll leave for the day. My brother is waiting for me.\u201d</p><p>But he wasn\u2019t done laughing. \u201cHoly crap, I didn\u2019t think it would ever happen\u2014I know that look! Someone\u2019s got you all softened up. Sarah\u2019s getting laid!\u201d</p><p>She got right in his face, put her palm against his chest and said, \u201cI just thought of a way to keep you out of Kodiak. Sexual harassment charges and court martial. That sound better than the Bering Sea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Sarah. What\u2019s a little teasing between friends?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She walked away from him, leaving everything on her desk. She went to the locker room to change out of her flight suit. Using her cell phone from there, she called the rescue diver on her team. \u201cPaul, do me a favor. Keep me out of prison. Occupy Stiles. He\u2019s giving me shit and I want to make a clean getaway before I kill him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet, boss.\u201d</p><p>She could count on Paul. She\u2019d have to get his family some kind of nice Christmas basket.</p><p>She changed into her jeans, blouse, sweater, boots. She put on some makeup, something she never did before leaving the station. Suddenly she wondered, could Cooper be as insensitive and cruel as Derek? Because she felt about Cooper right now just as she had once felt about Derek and it scared her to death. She had laughed with Derek as much, as often. She had relied on him in almost the same way she relied on Cooper\u2014as someone not just for her, but for Landon. And sex with Derek had been good.</p><p>But if she was honest, she had never really trusted Derek. She knew firsthand that he didn\u2019t always keep his word, that he could lie easily, but she had dismissed these as minor flaws because they were never about issues that really mattered. He would tell a friend he\u2019d completely forgotten he was going to help him move when, really, he had decided he\u2019d rather watch the ball game. He would promise to be home right after work and be two hours late, but he had excuses that at least sounded believable. Sorry, babe, we got arguing about a few completely miscalled plays, the game was in overtime, we added a beer to the discussion\u2014in which I was totally right, by the way\u2014and before I knew it...</p><p>But it had been tough to ignore what happened the day they got married.</p><p>Are you at Susan\u2019s house?</p><p>Susan\u2019s? Why would I be at Susan\u2019s?</p><p>I hear that dog\u2014the one next door to her. The one that never shuts up.</p><p>What dog?</p><p>I heard it in the background.</p><p>I don\u2019t hear anything. Sure it\u2019s not somewhere you are?</p><p>I\u2019m at the spa! And Susan isn\u2019t!</p><p>Well, call her, Sarah. I\u2019m about to walk out the door. I\u2019ll see you at four. Stop going crazy. You\u2019re just having nerves.</p><p>Aren\u2019t you? Having nerves?</p><p>No, Sarah. I\u2019m ready.</p><p>The one question Derek had never been able to answer\u2014why in the world did he marry Sarah if he still acted like a single guy? Screwing around? \u201cIt\u2019s not like I planned it. It just happened. And I don\u2019t love her\u2014I love you.\u201d</p><p>So maybe she should thank Derek for showing her the light? Because without some of his most disastrous lies, betrayals and infidelities, she would have fallen in love with Cooper in just a few weeks. But she had learned. Boy, had she learned.</p><p>She slid into the blazer she was wearing to Thanksgiving dinner at the McCains\u2019. And then the bell went off, followed by the intercom calling for a rescue team.</p><p>She had been leaving early, thanks to Derek, but at the sound, she was out of her clothes and back into her flight suit faster than lightning. She ran to the chopper.</p><p>\u201cSuspected heart attack, fifty-seven-year-old male, on The Misty Morning. Sixty-foot sailing vessel, luxury Oyster, about twenty miles northwest. Here are your coordinates,\u201d the crew chief said. \u201cReady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReady,\u201d she said. \u201cWe did the preflight checklist and gassed her up earlier. Paul finished the inventory. Is our guy conscious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo far. Want to wait for a doctor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe stand a better chance of bringing him in than waiting for the doc. Tell them to lower the sails. Paul? You have everything?\u201d she yelled. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>He was pulling on the bottom half of a wet suit. With all the rigging on a sailboat, she might have to put him in the water. \u201cGot it,\u201d he yelled back. Then, carrying his gear, he jogged to the helicopter.</p><p>Derek was pacing. She could tell he wanted on this flight, even though she would be pilot in command. Thankfully her copilot, sharp young Lieutenant JG, was on board, ready for their takeoff preflight. She was plugging in the coordinates. \u201cWe can eat up twenty miles in ten minutes.\u201d</p> <p>Copilot, maintenance crew chief, EMT all buckled in; takeoff preflight done. It was showtime.</p><p>\u201cAnd we are airborne,\u201d she said into the radio. \u201cSchuman, remind me that if I\u2019m ever going to have a heart attack, I want to have it on a sixty-foot yacht.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d he said.</p><p>Air traffic control gave her altitude and heading, and in two minutes, it was all water underneath them. Nine and a half minutes later, they had the vessel in sight. \u201cWe have a lot of rigging, but I can get you down on the deck, Paul. Harness up. Ready to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe can deploy the rescue basket after you assess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoger,\u201d he said, sitting in the open door of the chopper.</p><p>With the crew chief managing the reel, Paul descended to the deck. He dropped the emergency bag before he released the harness. The passengers seemed to be gathered around the patient. It was maybe four minutes before Paul said into his radio, \u201cWe have a possible coronary, patient\u2019s breathing on his own, severe chest pain. Let\u2019s take him aboard, Commander. Have medical and transport standing by.\u201d</p><p>The crew chief deployed the basket. Sarah maneuvered around the rigging and in just a few minutes the patient was aboard and they were headed in. Her mind was on nothing but flying until she was landing. It was then that she saw Derek again, through the open hangar doors, loitering around the debrief area. She wondered why he took so much pleasure in screwing with her head? Was it because she outranked him? Because she had caught him in his lies and thrown him out? Why didn\u2019t he take the high road, realize he\u2019d tortured her enough and make himself invisible? Or at least a little less obvious?</p><p>The ambulance crew rushed forward with a stretcher and she shut down the helicopter. \u201cDebrief in five,\u201d she said. \u201cThen if we\u2019re lucky, we\u2019re headed out for the rest of the day.\u201d</p><p>There was paperwork to file after a rescue, a crew debrief, but Sarah took a moment to text Landon. Had to fly; rescue mission. Don\u2019t wait for me. Tell everyone to eat.</p> <p>He texted back: Everyone okay?</p><p>So far, she responded.</p><p>Sixteen</p><p>Lou McCain wasn\u2019t that much of a cook\u2014other than her trademark spaghetti\u2014and she knew it. But Thanksgiving at her house had been a tradition since they\u2019d moved to Thunder Point. They always invited Gina and her gang, too. On every other day of the year, Carrie\u2014her closest friend\u2014cooked and baked for the deli. Gina helped with that, plus served in the diner. Lou thought it was the mark of a good friend to feed them on this particular day.</p><p>But this year was special: she was springing Joe on them.</p><p>While Eve helped her stuff the turkey, Lou broke the news. \u201cI\u2019ve invited a gentleman your dad knows to dinner. Joe Metcalf. He\u2019s a state trooper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Is he all alone for the holiday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, as it happens, he is, but that\u2019s not why I invited him.\u201d She took a deep breath. \u201cI\u2019ve been dating him a little.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReally?\u201d Eve asked, stunned. \u201cAnd you never said anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to make sure I liked him before bringing him home for dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHighway Patrol? How old is this guy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou had to ask.... He might be a little younger than me, but not all that much. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m some cougar...\u201d</p><p>Eve giggled and covered her mouth.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m sure you think this is funny. I\u2019ve been a little nervous about this, so you might lend some support. After all, I\u2019ve been squarely on your team when you want the car, when you\u2019re out on dates. Without me, you\u2019d be wearing a chastity belt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d Eve said. \u201cOkay, tell me more about this guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he\u2019s African-American. Mostly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMostly? Does that mean he\u2019s black?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLatte,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s also Native American, lots of different European and Caribbean.\u201d And then she smiled. \u201cHe\u2019s very beautiful.\u201d</p><p>When Joe arrived at one in the afternoon, Mac met him with a hearty handshake and invited him to grab a beer and come into the living room by the fire. But Joe said, \u201cGive me a little while.\u201d He took off his jacket, draped it on a kitchen chair and said, \u201cLet me help Lou in the kitchen first. She\u2019s not that much of a cook. Today I can guarantee pretty canap\u00e9s, no lumps in the potatoes, very smooth gravy and sweet potato pie like you\u2019ve never had. I\u2019d do pies, but my understanding is your friend Carrie is bringing them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou cook?\u201d Mac asked. \u201cAnd bake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother made sure I knew all her recipes so I wouldn\u2019t starve. I can make fried chicken so good you\u2019ll cry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d Mac said. \u201cLou, you have a nerve keeping Joe all to yourself for so long! The last time I had fried chicken, it came from the Colonel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was a colonel,\u201d Joe reminded him.</p><p>It all worked. Ryan and Dee Dee hardly noticed that Joe was new to the gathering; Carrie was delighted to finally meet him; Gina was shocked and pleased. Even Cooper, whom Mac had invited, seemed comfortable around Joe, even though they\u2019d just met.</p><p>There was only one pall on the celebration\u2014Sarah didn\u2019t make it. There were two more rescue flights, far more than was typical in a single day. She stayed for the debriefs, made sure everything was stable before she even attempted to leave. It was seven-thirty when she texted Landon that she was exhausted and just needed to go home. Holidays could be like that for first responders\u2014accidents, crimes, severe illness, sometimes brought on by overindulgence. Lou was sorry Sarah couldn\u2019t celebrate with Landon and Cooper, because she felt a surge of satisfaction when she saw her family all together around the table\u2014and Joe there, too.</p><p>Cooper found Thanksgiving at the McCains to be as close to a family gathering as he\u2019d been to in years. He hung out with the men in Mac\u2019s living room while the women stayed mostly in the kitchen. The kids were downstairs in the basement-turned-rumpus-room until Ryan and Dee Dee came up because, \u201cThey\u2019re kissing!\u201d</p><p>Then it was on Joe and Cooper to keep Mac upstairs. \u201cTake it easy, Mac,\u201d Joe said. \u201cKissing is good. If they still have their clothes on.\u201d</p><p>He wished Sarah had been there, even if she was in the kitchen with the women, but he understood about work. He liked that everyone trusted Sarah enough that no one was worried about her. Landon was used to this and had a lot of respect for his sister\u2019s ability. Cooper had been a pilot himself and since the weather was good, he wasn\u2019t concerned. It was a house full of first responders\u2014people were used to call-outs.</p><p>After dinner, Ashley and her boyfriend, Downy, showed up for dessert; they had been with his family for part of the day. Then there was a round of charades. If someone had told Cooper a year ago he\u2019d play charades with three generations of people and laugh his ass off, he\u2019d have called them crazy. After charades, they broke out the Wii and had a bowling and rock star competition.</p><p>Cooper hung around the McCains until the text came to Landon, then he pulled the kid aside and, in a quiet voice, said, \u201cI\u2019m going to take off. I think I\u2019ll beg a covered dish from Aunt Lou for your sister and wait for her at your house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t, like, have a key, do you?\u201d Landon asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. She\u2019s on her way, right? I\u2019ll sit out front.\u201d</p><p>Landon looked a little troubled. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Lou was more than happy to fix up some leftovers for Sarah, something she could put in the microwave, plus some pie. She even forced a bottle of wine on him, in case there wasn\u2019t any at Sarah\u2019s house. And then Landon walked Cooper to his truck.</p><p>\u201cListen, maybe we should talk about this,\u201d Landon said.</p><p>\u201cThis?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want Sarah to go out, to have fun. In fact, I need her to. When all she\u2019s got is me, it just...I don\u2019t know...just gets very heavy. But her ex\u2014he hurt her. It was a terrible thing to watch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did he do to her, Landon?\u201d Cooper asked. \u201cAnything I should know about that, anything above and beyond the usual rigors of divorce?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could tell you, but I don\u2019t know how she\u2019d take it. Ask her yourself, Coop. Let her tell you. And then, go out, have fun, whatever. But if you hurt her, if you do anything that makes her cry every day for six months, I swear to God...\u201d</p><p>\u201cLandon, I don\u2019t want Sarah to be hurt. I like her. It might be easier to avoid that if I knew what I\u2019m not supposed to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, for starters, don\u2019t cheat on her. That\u2019s all I\u2019m saying.\u201d</p><p>Cooper shrugged. \u201cThat\u2019s easy. I\u2019m kind of simple\u2014one woman is about all I can handle. More than one at a time? Bigger than I am, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Landon said. \u201cGood to know. Because Sarah hasn\u2019t had many boyfriends. Derek, he was a surprise. I\u2019m sure she went out with guys because I had babysitters sometimes, but Derek was the first one she got serious about and I was thirteen. So what I\u2019m saying here is, Sarah doesn\u2019t have a lot of experience with guys. If you screw her up...\u201d</p><p>He felt a smile come to his lips. Sarah wasn\u2019t inexperienced. Or maybe she was a natural. But one thing was clear\u2014she hadn\u2019t paraded an army of beaux past her little brother, yet another thing for which he admired her.</p><p>Cooper put a hand on his shoulder. \u201cI promise,\u201d he said. \u201cBut, Landon, I\u2019m leaving after Christmas. January, maybe February at the latest. I told Sarah, and you knew from the start, I\u2019m going to have to find work. This place? I like it\u2014it\u2019s a good place. But I\u2019m just passing through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I get that. That\u2019s not the same thing as using someone. Hurting someone. I said all I have to say.\u201d He pulled his keys out of his pocket.</p><p>\u201cWait a minute,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cMaybe you should tell me what the ex did to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019d asked me that a few months ago, I would have had a load of crap to lay on you. First, he practically killed my sister, she was so sad. And I haven\u2019t heard a word from him since he left us over a year ago. We had to move because Sarah couldn\u2019t make the mortgage by herself. And she moved me to Nowhereville. But now? I don\u2019t want to hear from him and I like Nowhereville. And there\u2019s Eve...\u201d</p><p>Cooper chuckled. \u201cI might be just a cockeyed optimist, but things seem to work out the way they\u2019re supposed to.\u201d</p><p>Landon gave him a key off his key ring. \u201cLet yourself in. Warm up her dinner. She comes off a bunch of rescues just shot to hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen are you going to be home?\u201d Cooper asked. \u201cSo I can pass that on to your sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen Deputy Yummy Pants throws me out,\u201d he said.</p><p>A loud bark of laughter escaped Cooper.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what the women call him behind his back. Believe me, from where I\u2019m sitting, he\u2019s not all that sexy. I\u2019ll leave when he says I\u2019m leaving. Let Ham out, will you? And leave my key on the kitchen table, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, kid. Behave yourself.\u201d And he left for Sarah\u2019s house.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t home yet. This was only the second time Cooper had been to Sarah\u2019s house and his first time inside. It was very small, he knew from their conversations\u2014two whole bedrooms. But she had a fenced backyard, absolutely necessary for Ham. And there was a small fireplace in the living room. Probably the best part about the house was the front porch. It was covered and stretched the length of the front of the house. If she owned the property or if she were staying here permanently, she could enclose it or screen it. From that front porch, there was a view of the bay and, in the distance, a small light across the beach. The light he\u2019d left on over the door of his fifth wheel. She could also see the town, the main street, the marina. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>He took off his boots inside the front door. He let Ham out the back door and, using the wood and pinecone starters, he built a fire. Then he put the covered dish holding the turkey dinner beside the microwave on the counter and the wine in the refrigerator.</p><p>When she walked in the back door, she looked stunned. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p> <p>He stood from the sofa. \u201cI brought you some leftovers and made you a fire. Landon gave me a key\u2014I left it on the table. Listen, I don\u2019t have to stay. You must be worn-out. Long day?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged out of her coat and tossed it over the back of a kitchen chair. \u201cFourteen hours, the last two just mopping up the paperwork. Three rescues in one day\u2014unprecedented. I was going to stop off for a bottle of wine, but since it\u2019s Thanksgiving evening, not much is open.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot you covered, Commander,\u201d he said. \u201cAunt Lou wouldn\u2019t let me leave without one. I\u2019ll open it for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a good man to have around,\u201d she said, going to the sofa. She pulled off her boots. He must have found the corkscrew right away; she heard only one drawer slide open. When he started opening kitchen cupboards, she said, \u201cOver the toaster oven, next to the refrigerator.\u201d A minute later he brought her a glass of wine.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I should get going.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOnly if you want to,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m up to a little quiet company. I\u2019m sorry I missed the dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe played charades,\u201d he said, then surprised himself with a laugh. He sat beside her. \u201cLandon had a father-son talk with me. This time I was the son. He\u2019s pretty worried, Sarah. Afraid that getting mixed up with me is going to leave you brokenhearted and broken-down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, poor Landon. You can\u2019t blame him. It was so hard on him, seeing me fall apart the way I did over the divorce. This doesn\u2019t have anything to do with you, Cooper. In fact, it\u2019s very nice to have a friend like you. And I\u2019ve gotten closer to Gina and let me tell you, it\u2019s been a while since I had a girlfriend. I needed that, too.\u201d</p><p>With a finger, he ran her short hair around her ear. He smiled. \u201cWill you think I\u2019m a complete pig if I tell you that sleeping with you really winds my watch?\u201d</p><p>She grinned. \u201cWe\u2019ve never slept.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you drive me out of my mind. I\u2019ve needed a friend like you, too.\u201d</p> <p>She chuckled. \u201cNeeded to get laid, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat, too. Listen, I made a slight change in plans. While the bait shop is being worked on, while Rawley is around to keep an eye on the reconstruction, I\u2019m going to head to Albuquerque to visit my family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cIn a week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you planned to go for Christmas?\u201d she asked, sipping her wine.</p><p>\u201cI was considering it. But I decided I wanted to be around here. Do you have plans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI only work Christmas Eve until four, unless it turns into another day like today. And I have Landon, when he\u2019s not with Eve.\u201d She curled up against Cooper\u2019s side. \u201cThis is his first girlfriend, unless you count Cindy Freeman when he was seven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a goner,\u201d Cooper said, putting his arms around her. \u201cHave you talked to him about, you know...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTalked to him and armed him. But God, I hope he doesn\u2019t have sex.\u201d She lifted her head. \u201cIs there any way we can keep them from having sex?\u201d</p><p>Cooper just shook his head. \u201cHas he talked about you having sex with a nomad who lives in a tin can?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cHe must be leaving that up to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. You turned out to have very good judgment about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean the way I jumped your bones on the second date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy favorite part. Want me to warm your dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Can you put it in the refrigerator when you\u2019re up getting me another glass of wine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d he said, reluctantly pulling away from her. And then he was back, handing her the wine and pulling her against him. In lieu of hot, crazy sex, just holding her was very satisfying. He told her what he\u2019d heard at the McCains\u2019 about Christmas, about the decorating of the town, about parties, about a legendary open house at Gina and Carrie\u2019s house, catered by the only caterer in town. \u201cAnd we\u2019re included, if interested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLovely,\u201d she said, sipping. She tilted her head to look up at him. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want you to worry\u2014if your plans change and you have to be with family, it\u2019s not going to be a problem.\u201d</p><p>Ah, she was holding him at arm\u2019s length. Even though he didn\u2019t have the details, it was enough to know she\u2019d had a real bad experience. It was hard for her to trust. A year ago, five years ago, even ten years ago\u2014this was him. He was always afraid to get too close. \u201cBarring some family emergency, I\u2019ll be here,\u201d he said. \u201cTell me about the rescues.\u201d</p><p>So while she cuddled up to him and sipped her wine, she told him about one possible coronary, a boat taking on water forty miles offshore, a hiker who\u2019d spent Thanksgiving day in the woods at about five thousand feet, lost and with hypothermia. And then her glass was nearly empty. \u201cWill you put this on the coffee table, please?\u201d</p><p>He laughed at her. \u201cIs it good having your very own valet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is good,\u201d she said, resting her head against his chest. \u201cAnd you double as a pillow very nicely, too.\u201d</p><p>He pulled a throw off the end of the sofa and covered her and some of himself, as well. \u201cWanna make out?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cHmm. Can\u2019t. Landon could be coming in anytime now. Plus I don\u2019t know how to make out with you without taking my clothes off and making crazy, insane, insatiable love to you.\u201d</p><p>He laughed and it ended in a low growl and a kiss on her forehead. \u201cDon\u2019t seek help for that, all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I walk Ham tomorrow, maybe you can get a nooner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take it,\u201d he whispered. And then he let his eyes close while he held her before he thought about it much longer\u2014that she was the best thing he\u2019d ever come across. And she was afraid to let him in.</p><p>Her soft snore put him to sleep. He had no idea what time it was when he heard the back door and Ham\u2019s excitement. His feet were propped on the coffee table, and she was curled in a small ball against him with one leg thrown over his. He had both arms around her. He opened one eye to see Landon standing in front of them, his hands on his hips, a smile on his face.</p><p>\u201cOh, you kids,\u201d Landon said with a smile. \u201cI\u2019m going to bed.\u201d</p><p>Cooper gave a small nod and just pulled Sarah closer. His contentment was too rich for him to get up and leave.</p><p>The diner had been closed on Thanksgiving Day. It opened bright and early the next morning, though the crowd was sparse. Quite a few people took a long weekend and many left town to be with family in other towns or states. Gina had the diner\u2019s laptop open on the counter, paying a few bills for Stu, when Scott Grant came in. This time, no small children\u2014he was alone.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d she said, closing her laptop.</p><p>He sat up at the counter right in front of her in Mac\u2019s seat. \u201cDo you live here, Gina?\u201d he asked with a smile.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d think so, right? I work a lot when I\u2019m not in school. When I have classes, Stu adjusts my schedule as much as possible. I work the day shift, from early morning to midafternoon. I have three busy periods in here\u2014early-early morning, early-late morning and lunch. I only work nights if someone\u2019s sick or needs time off. I hate nights. I\u2019m a morning person.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cI must be, too. I\u2019ve never seen anyone but you behind the counter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a small diner. Usually only one person at a time is needed, except on Friday and Saturday nights. Then Stu\u2019s wife, Belinda, and one of our teenagers work together, and it\u2019s like open warfare. I stay as far away as possible. How was your Thanksgiving?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurprisingly bearable. My mother and mother-in-law are in town. Which is why I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, really?\u201d she asked, lifting a brow.</p><p>\u201cGabriella is in Vancouver with her family for a few days, and the grandmothers are here with me. The house is small and getting a little close. If you get my drift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind me asking, why don\u2019t you live closer to your family?\u201d she asked, while automatically pouring him a cup of coffee.</p><p>\u201cI could lie and say it was all about work, but that wouldn\u2019t be entirely true. I did medical school and residency in California\u2014Serena and I were happy there. Our mothers are widows, overbearing, controlling and in competition with each other. I\u2019ve been fantasizing a way back to California ever since. When the Vancouver hospital where I\u2019d been working since before I lost Serena started downsizing, I started looking. I really need a fresh start. And space from the grandmothers. It\u2019s hard to get on with your life with your mother and mother-in-law breathing down your neck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d she said. \u201cSo, that\u2019s your only family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no,\u201d he said with a laugh. \u201cI have a sister, two years older, who said, \u2018Thanks a whole hell of a lot,\u2019 when I told her we were moving. I guess I left her with our mother, who needs a lot of attention. Unfortunately for me, my mother is pretty focused on her poor widowed son and motherless grandchildren. But when she\u2019s not focused on me, she\u2019s very busy trying to get my sister married.\u201d He sipped his coffee. \u201cThey\u2019re leaving Monday. Can I stay with you until then?\u201d</p><p>She laughed at him.</p><p>\u201cSo, I don\u2019t know your schedule, but is there a good time to, you know, go out? Because I\u2019ve been on one date since my wife died. That was in Vancouver and she saw two little kids\u2014Jenny wasn\u2019t potty trained yet\u2014and she ran for her life.\u201d</p><p>Gina was stunned. Her mouth fell open. \u201cMe?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cSomething wrong with you? You in a relationship or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm...no. Did you know I am the single, never-married mother of a sixteen-year-old and I live with my mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know that, as a matter of fact. Level with me, Gina\u2014is she like my mother? Demanding, oversensitive and generally controlling? Because really...been there, done that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said with a laugh. \u201cMy mother is awesome. She\u2019s Carrie of Carrie\u2019s Deli and Catering. She\u2019s an angel come to earth, with an edge. She\u2019s real good people, but she doesn\u2019t suffer fools gladly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s a relief. So...that means what? I have to get you home early?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my gosh, do you have any idea how long it\u2019s been since I\u2019ve been on a date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, don\u2019t panic\u2014I met my wife in high school. I know, ridiculous, right? So I\u2019ve had one date, and I think I wasn\u2019t very good at it. And before you start to worry, I\u2019m not looking for a mother for my poor motherless children or anything like that. I\u2019d just like to go out with someone instead of with a bunch of hospital staff or two little kids or alone. I think I\u2019m about due for some fun. And I want to learn more about your town and the people around here. I bet you can tell me a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, that I can do. I\u2019m not working Sunday morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. I have grandmothers to keep busy with babysitting and going crazy wondering who I might be going out with! It\u2019s childish, but it serves them right. Pick you up at six?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFantastic. Now, you want some eggs or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good. Eggs, over easy\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t go there,\u201d she said. \u201cOmelet or scrambled or over hard. Stu is a sweet man, but not a gentle hand in the kitchen.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cOkay, omelet. Is bacon okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s his specialty. Crispy. And wheat toast and some home fries?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cExcellent. Then I\u2019m going over to the shop to work a little bit. Want to write down your address for me? Is your house hard to find?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s two blocks from here, Scott.\u201d She slapped his order ticket on the cook\u2019s counter. \u201cYou can see it from the front of the store. I\u2019ll write down the address.\u201d</p><p>When he was finishing up his breakfast, he asked, \u201cSo, what kind of classes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSocial work. I think, after I do an internship, I\u2019d like to be a counselor. That\u2019s way down the road for me, though. Right now Ashley is my priority\u2014getting her through college and on her own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? And could the citizens of Thunder Point use a counselor?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEvery last person here,\u201d she said, grinning.</p><p>Mac went to the diner at around ten in the morning and caught Gina reading. \u201cHey, slow morning?\u201d</p><p>She closed the book. \u201cDay after Thanksgiving is always a little quiet. People have tons of leftovers to plow through.\u201d</p><p>He sat at the counter and she poured him coffee. \u201cI had a nice time yesterday, Gina.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a good day, wasn\u2019t it? I think everyone enjoyed it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re not mad at me anymore,\u201d he said.</p> <p>She took a steadying breath. \u201cI apologize. You were in the line of fire. I\u2019m not angry with you, Mac. I was angry with myself and took it out on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd would you mind sharing? What are you angry with yourself about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s kind of hard to explain, but here goes. When I saw Sarah and Cooper holding hands and gazing at each other, I became so envious. I haven\u2019t been on a date in years! I haven\u2019t had anyone hold my hand or gaze into my eyes like I\u2019m special in so long...maybe ever! I\u2019m only thirty-two. I have nearly raised a daughter, almost have a degree, and I don\u2019t have a life. And I am bloody sick of not having a life. That\u2019s all it was\u2014just a woman mourning her abandoned womanhood.\u201d</p><p>Mac thought, My timing is perfect! Outside of police work, his timing was seldom on, but for once... \u201cThen I\u2019m in the right place at the right time. Let\u2019s go out Saturday night. No kids, no aunt, no mother. Just you and me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she said uncomfortably. \u201cListen, it\u2019s not like I don\u2019t appreciate the gesture, but I\u2019m not looking for another friendly little buddy hookup. I\u2019ll hang out with you anytime, Mac. Your friendship is very important to me. But I actually want a real date with the potential for a little hand-holding. Maybe even a kiss good-night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a date with Scott Grant for Saturday night. We\u2019re going out to dinner. Without kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScott Grant?\u201d he asked, though he knew exactly who that was.</p> <p>\u201cDr. Grant?\u201d she returned.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said, irritably. \u201cYou like him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I like him or I wouldn\u2019t go out with him,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s very nice. I don\u2019t have any expectations, but he wants to take me out and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might\u2019ve warned me,\u201d Mac said.</p><p>Her brows knit. \u201cOf what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you needed to have a date. After all, we\u2019ve been\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBuddies,\u201d she said. \u201cPals. No offense, Mac, but I don\u2019t need another pal. I wouldn\u2019t trade you for anything, but I really think I\u2019m now mature enough for a boyfriend. It doesn\u2019t have to be happily ever after, I just want a shot at it. I\u2019m not saying that will be Scott Grant, but what the hell. I\u2019m going on a date!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve taken you out!\u201d he boomed.</p><p>\u201cNot exactly,\u201d she corrected. \u201cWe\u2019ve gone out together, but you made yourself very clear\u2014you can\u2019t have a relationship. You have children to raise. And I am ready for a relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, fuck,\u201d he said, which he almost never said in front of a woman.</p><p>\u201cYeah, and that,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cGina!\u201d he barked, appalled.</p><p>\u201cWell, forgive me for living!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just swore because I was late in asking you out, behind Medical Man. Not because it was a game plan! Look, I\u2019ll take you out, hold your hand, look at you like you\u2019re special\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa, thanks so much. But I have plans,\u201d she said, lifting her chin. \u201cAnd I think three years was enough time to give you to get ready. I\u2019m going to move on. But gee, really, thanks so much for the offer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Gina,\u201d he said with a bit of a whine. \u201cYou know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBreakfast, Mac? Or just coffee today?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still mad at me. Jesus, I had no idea this was happening in your head. You should have told me!\u201d</p><p>She leaned on the counter and looked into his eyes. \u201cMac, my dear friend, here is something you should probably know about women without being told. We don\u2019t want to have to tell a man we need to be wanted. We\u2019d really like that to come naturally. We\u2019d like a man to pursue us because he wants us, not because he\u2019s out of options.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo\u2014omelet or scrambled?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre we done talking about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll done.\u201d</p><p>Seventeen</p><p>As a matter of tradition, the chamber of commerce pulled out the Christmas decorations on the Saturday after Thanksgiving. In between serving and cooking, this was the day Stu and Gina worked on decorating the diner, with the help of Stu\u2019s wife, Belinda, and Ashley. Carrie put up a wreath on her door and garland on the deli showcase. Everyone managed to pass through town at a point, whether to help or watch. Cooper was hanging around and, since he was handy, he was up on a ladder adding streamers and garland to the old-fashioned light posts on the main street. Even Wayland Carmichael was decorating his bar, Wayland\u2019s. The good doctor showed up for a while and hung a decorated sign on his door that said Clinic Coming Soon.</p><p>Sarah showed up for a while with Ham, on her way to the beach, and Cooper climbed down his ladder to talk to her. He slipped an arm around her waist, kissed her cheek, laughed with her for a minute. When she went on her way to walk the dog, he gave her a pat on the rump.</p><p>Mac made his way to Cooper. \u201cYou barely hit town and you already found yourself a woman.\u201d</p><p>Cooper just smiled. He gave a nod, but his gaze was following Sarah. When she turned the corner, he looked at Mac. \u201cWhich begs the question, what\u2019s taking you so long? Didn\u2019t you say you\u2019ve been divorced for years?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSore subject,\u201d Mac said.</p><p>Cooper looked across the street and Mac followed with his eyes. Gina was holding a wreath for the front door, talking to Scott Grant, laughing. \u201cWhat about Gina? You two seem to get along.\u201d</p><p>Mac frowned. \u201cShe\u2019s going out with the new doctor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that sucks. Maybe it won\u2019t work out.\u201d</p><p>As they watched, Gina and Scott laughed at something. Then Scott tweaked her cheek, whispered something that made her smile and turned to leave. Before getting in his car, he lifted his hand to wave to Mac and Cooper.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Mac said glumly.</p><p>\u201cI have to go,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cI\u2019m going to meet Sarah at my place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need to know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes she\u2019s tired from her jog and needs to lie down awhile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally, you can keep it to yourself, asshole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHamlet likes to watch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a sick fucker, you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m kidding, all right? I have Gatorade.\u201d</p><p>Mac spent the rest of the afternoon either putting up decorations or giving his opinion about what looked right. He did a lot of observing at the same time, watching everyone who had come to help. Like Ray Anne, in jeans so tight it was a miracle she could stoop or squat, heels with the jeans, leather vest over red silk blouse, cleavage and mistletoe in her hair. Talk about obvious. His aunt was giving Ray Anne a wide berth. Everyone knew they didn\u2019t get along.</p><p>Puck Morrison was in town for a while, his family notably absent. Mac observed that Puck seemed to be stooping, having a little trouble moving around. Everyone aged differently, but he thought Puck was about seventy, maybe a hair over. He looked worn-out. Maybe it was arthritis, slowing him down. One thing for sure, he\u2019d look a lot better without that damn hairpiece he wore.</p><p>At about four, Wayland started passing out beer to the people still working on the street. Lou took off with the younger kids. Eve and Landon followed in Landon\u2019s truck\u2014those two appeared to be joined at the hip. Ashley, Gina and Carrie walked home, giving him a wave as they left.</p><p>Right. Gotta get dressed for that date.</p><p>Mac went home. There was a nice smell in the kitchen, but no one was around. Then Lou walked in, dressed all nice, fixing an earring. \u201cThere you are,\u201d she said. \u201cEve is going out with Landon tonight\u2014I think to a movie or something. The kids are downstairs playing video games. Dee Dee wanted a sleepover but I said not tonight, not after all day in town decorating. I\u2019m going out. I didn\u2019t check plans with you\u2014are you home tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m home,\u201d he said wearily.</p><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t really have mattered. Dee Dee and Ryan are fine on their own. There\u2019s meat loaf and mashed potatoes staying warm in the oven on low. Green beans in there, too. It\u2019s ready whenever you are. I\u2019ll be on my way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBunco?\u201d he asked, lifting one sardonic brow.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s a thrill for you, Mac. I don\u2019t even know how to play bunco.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFigures,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be home later,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not staying over or anything. We\u2019re going out to dinner in North Bend, going to walk along the pier, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow would I know?\u201d he asked churlishly.</p><p>\u201cIf you want to go out for a beer or something, give the kids dinner and tell them to lock the door. You have your cell phone.\u201d</p><p>But he didn\u2019t feel like being friendly. He\u2019d been as friendly as he could manage all day. He was sunk in a deep pit of self-pity at the moment and it was best to indulge that alone. Everyone had someone, it seemed. Everyone except him. He\u2019d made such perfect sense to himself years ago, when he thought it through and decided dating Gina was a bad idea. He\u2019d been attracted to her\u2014at first because she was beautiful, then he quickly learned that her mind and heart were even more beautiful. Plus, she had courage and she never gave up, even when the hardest times hit her. And naturally, especially with what he\u2019d been through in his short marriage and divorce, the fact that her daughter was her priority earned her every ounce of respect he could muster. So in the back of his head, he\u2019d had a plan. When the girls were college-bound or at least almost college-bound, he\u2019d court her. He\u2019d tell her then that he\u2019d always wanted her, but he worried about the possible conflicts.</p><p>Way to go, Deputy Yummy Pants, he thought. He\u2019d waited too long. He had Cooper to thank for that\u2014Cooper hitting town and hooking up practically overnight, illustrating to Gina that she\u2019d put all her eggs in the wrong damn basket. He thought he was being brave and strong, holding off while they each had such complicated lives. How was he supposed to know that she was needing a little loving as much as he was?</p><p>He couldn\u2019t get more stupid if he made an effort.</p><p>He cleaned the dishes after dinner, giving the kids a night off. He brewed himself a cup of coffee. He sat in his living room with his Labs and sulked, imagining her holding hands across the tablecloth with the doctor in a candlelit restaurant. He hated that doctor. Really, a doctor? A high school graduate up against a doctor? It was hopeless. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>At almost eight o\u2019clock his cell phone chimed and he saw it was Pritkus.</p><p>\u201cYeah, boss, it\u2019s Christmastime in Mayberry. Got a pretty ugly domestic out at the Morrisons\u2019, ambulance en route. I wouldn\u2019t mind a little help from a supervisor.\u201d</p> <p>He stood before Pritkus stopped talking. \u201cWho are you taking in for it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooks like the kid for sure and probably the missus, too. Puck is going in the ambulance. He\u2019s going to be fine, but when you see this place, you\u2019re gonna shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn my way,\u201d he said.</p><p>He shouted for the kids as he pulled his shirt off and headed to his bedroom. He took only two minutes to get into his uniform, simultaneously telling Ryan and Dee Dee to lock him out, call his cell if they had any problems, stay in and if he was going to be later than ten he\u2019d give them a call on the house phone. When they asked what it was about he said, \u201cI\u2019m not sure yet. Some kind of fight that Pritkus wants a supervisor to help with. Probably all paperwork now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are you going so fast and hurry?\u201d Dee Dee asked.</p> <p>\u201cBecause when an officer asks for a supervisor, you always go fast and hurry, but there\u2019s nothing to worry about.\u201d He kissed their heads and shot out the door, pausing long enough to listen to the locks slide into place. He waited until he was out of his own neighborhood to hit the lights and siren. It was very rare in Thunder Point to see a Sheriff\u2019s Department SUV racing through town, lights flashing.</p><p>There were already two patrol cars at the residence, lights flashing. Two was one more car than they usually had in town and Mac\u2019s made it three. That kind of turnout was usually reserved for major catastrophes. The ornate front doors of the Morrison residence were standing open. With his hand resting comfortably on the handle of his gun, Mac walked inside, glass crunching beneath his boots.</p><p>The place looked like a bomb had gone off. There was toppled furniture and broken glass everywhere. In the formal living room, Jag and his mother sat on the sofa, cuffed, while Puck held an ice pack to his bleeding head. There was blood splattered here and there, on the floor and furniture, on the suspects and the victim.</p><p>\u201cWho called it in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Morrison made the nine-one-one call,\u201d Pritkus said. \u201cShe said her son was attacking her husband. When we got here, the story changed to her husband was attacking her and she was defending herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow convenient.\u201d Mac bent at the waist to be eye level with Puck. \u201cWho did this, Mr. Morrison?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell my attorney.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho broke up all the china and crystal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d Mrs. Morrison said. \u201cIs it against the law? It\u2019s mine, right? If I want to throw around the glassware, that\u2019s my business, right?\u201d</p><p>Mac turned and stepped toward her. She looked like bloody hell, her hair a rat\u2019s nest, her eye makeup running in black rivers down her cheeks, the sleeve of her blouse torn. Skinny as she was, with that sneer on her lips, she looked like a war victim.</p><p>Puck, on the other hand, though his face was battered and his head bleeding, looked better without the hairpiece. As expected, he was completely bald with some spikes of short white hair all over his shiny dome.</p><p>\u201cAnd whatever possessed you to start throwing things?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI was angry!\u201d she said, stiffening her skinny spine.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s such a loser,\u201d Jag muttered.</p> <p>Mac merely glanced at him. Apparently he had an opinion here. He lifted his eyebrows and waited. But it was Mrs. Morrison who spoke up.</p><p>\u201cHe informed us we\u2019re moving. Letting the house go, selling most of our possessions and moving because he can\u2019t make a goddamn living! I\u2019ve wasted most of my life on him and now this? So I threw a plate or two? Isn\u2019t that allowed when someone tells you your life is over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that right? Wasted your life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe if you hadn\u2019t spent it all, Effie,\u201d Puck said.</p><p>\u201cHow could I spend it all? Didn\u2019t you give most of it to your ex?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have sons!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you have a son right here!\u201d she shrieked. \u201cA son who\u2019s getting nothing!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe gets plenty. You get plenty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy brothers drove Hummers in high school,\u201d Jag grumbled. \u201cYou put them up in classy town houses for college. What\u2019ve I got? A used car and a quad.\u201d He laughed meanly.</p><p>\u201cFirst, no more country club, then no more vacations, then no new cars. We have used!\u201d Effie cried out. \u201cThen the credit cards. Then the house? I can\u2019t take it! You promised me! You promised me everything!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promised you what I had and you took it. It is now gone!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy the hell didn\u2019t you buy that stupid Bailey land and spin it into a big sale? I told you to go get it, but what did you do? Sent that hussy real estate agent to try to convince him! Loser! Jag\u2019s right, you\u2019re a loser.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t want to sell!\u201d Puck said.</p><p>\u201cYou should\u2019ve found a way!\u201d she said.</p><p>Without quite knowing why, Mac looked at Jag, narrowing his eyes. Jag just glared at his father. Finally Jag said, \u201cThere were ways. He just didn\u2019t have the balls.\u201d</p><p>Whoa, Mac thought. He paused, went over procedure in his mind, because he really didn\u2019t want to screw this up. He smelled grand jury investigation becoming an indictment, not just on the battery, but possibly murder. Investigations weren\u2019t fast and they were dicey and complex.</p><p>\u201cDid you have the balls, son?\u201d he asked Jag. \u201cCould you have made it work? The sale of that property?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d he shot out angrily. \u201cMy job is to go to high school, all right? It\u2019s his job to run the business, support the family! And he\u2019s an old loser!\u201d</p><p>Mac slowly turned toward Puck. \u201cWho hit you in the head? Who injured you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk to my lawyer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine. The missus and young Jag here are going for a ride. We have a domestic with injuries and that\u2019s what happens. Anyone we can call for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy sons,\u201d he said. \u201cMy older sons.\u201d</p><p>And that was just about all Mac needed to hear.</p><p>Mac worked on Sunday, much of that time looking at public records on his computer at his office, even though people who were finishing up the Christmas decorating kept coming into his office. What he wanted to know was what had brought Puck Morrison to this point in his life. What he learned was a lot of it was lust.</p><p>When Puck was a fresh young kid, he married Miranda Lessing, both of them from Eugene, Oregon. She gave him two sons, helped with his development and brokerage business and they became a successful team. When his sons were seven and nine he bought a nice piece of land on the point and built himself a showy house, surrounding it with an ornate wrought-iron fence. It looked, according to public record, like it was four years from the time he bought the land until the house was finished.</p><p>When he was in his fifties, he divorced his wife of thirty years and immediately married a twenty-two-year-old town girl, Effinesia Carter Sloan. She gave birth to her only son, Jaguar Morrison, three months later. They moved into the Morrison mansion at that time.</p><p>Wow, Mac thought. How cool the way public record matched up with the local lore. He\u2019d heard this story. Carrie James had told Lou long ago about the scandal, about how Miranda\u2014a kind, intelligent and giving woman by all accounts\u2014left the big house, packed up her half of the furnishings and her half of the money, and went home to Eugene where she started a successful brokerage firm. Her sons worked for her, one in construction and one in sales.</p><p>There was no public record to support the gossip that Effie got her bosom before her marriage to Puck, but there was record of his financial difficulties and his ex-wife\u2019s financial success\u2014enough to suggest maybe she\u2019d been the brains behind their business partnership. Puck was a nice guy, though, funny and involved in the community and usually a good neighbor, if a little uppity sometimes. Guys around town didn\u2019t mind raising a glass with him from time to time, toasting this or that, telling a few off-color jokes.</p><p>No one from the Morrison debacle would admit to anything, but Mac put Puck in the hospital and Effie and Jag in jail, based on the 911 call and the interview at the scene. Their lawyer had them out before Mac completed his research of public records on Sunday.</p><p>On Monday he went to talk to the county district attorney and the coroner about whether there was sufficient cause to reopen the investigation into Ben Bailey\u2019s death. \u201cI think this constitutes motive,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t say I have evidence, but there were some very suspicious statements. And I\u2019d like to know more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are you looking at?\u201d the D.A. asked him.</p><p>\u201cWell, Puck weighs about one-forty and is five foot four and seventy-three years old. His wife is five-five and a hundred and ten. But their boy, who doesn\u2019t seem to like the idea of settling for less than his older half brothers had, is a pretty big kid. And a lot of their angst seems to rest on that property of Ben\u2019s\u2014something they seem to think could\u2019ve rescued them. I just want to know if that\u2019s just talk...or if there\u2019s something more to discover.\u201d</p><p>Gina hadn\u2019t seen Mac, except from afar as he went in and out of his office across the street from the diner a few times. It appeared he wasn\u2019t working too much, and there was no explanation for it. Finally, on Thursday, he came in for his morning coffee at around ten. She put her hands on her hips. \u201cWell. It\u2019s about time! Where have you been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a busy week.\u201d He sat on the stool in front of her.</p><p>\u201cBusy with your disturbance out at the Morrisons\u2019?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYou know I can\u2019t talk about that,\u201d he said, but he smiled.</p><p>\u201cYou can talk to me! I\u2019m the soul of discretion. All I want to know is, who hit who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDepends on who you ask and when you ask them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t a nine-one-one call a matter of public record?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWhen the case is no longer under investigation,\u201d he reminded her.</p><p>\u201cDetails! I heard it was Jag beating up his little old father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJag and his mother were both arrested on battery charges. They were released on bail almost immediately, even though we have a twenty-four-hour hold on battery suspects. Time enough for the victim or possible victim to get away if he or she wants to get away. But with Puck in the hospital overnight\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPuck moved out of the house, I heard.\u201d</p><p>Mac lifted both brows. \u201cReally? Now that\u2019s news. Where\u2019d he go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe to his older son\u2019s\u2014someone said they saw his oldest son\u2019s truck pass through town. I have to tell you, Mac, the diner has been a real hotbed of gossip this week\u2014and you were nowhere to be found!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had serious paperwork and there were a couple of things in Coquille I had to do, so Steve Pritkus has been minding the town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, what did you do to him?\u201d she demanded. \u201cHe used to be one of the best gossips around. Did you threaten him or something?\u201d</p><p>Mac laughed at her. \u201cI did. I told him he could tell anyone but you.\u201d</p><p>She slapped his arm. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t dare!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould so. Changing subjects, I want to know about the date. You threw me over for the doctor, so tell me about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was lovely,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t throw you over. He asked, I accepted, we had a very nice dinner out in Coquille.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he kiss you good-night?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She leaned toward him, hands pressed on the counter. \u201cWho hit little old Puck?\u201d</p><p>He reached for her hand. \u201cWas it really nice? The date?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>She stared down at their entwined fingers and thought, Wow, I\u2019m a little slow. It took her going out with someone else to bring him to life, to get him to touch her. \u201cHe\u2019s a very nice guy. We\u2019re about the same age. And yes, I had a good time.\u201d If you consider listening to someone talk about his peerless deceased wife for three hours fun, she thought.</p><p>But she\u2019d realized Scott really needed to do that. She was his first date in years, after all. And the first step was unloading all that stuff. At first she enjoyed their conversation\u2014he wasn\u2019t grieving so much as remembering the perfect woman. And then he hooked her\u2014it was therapy, and she was the therapist. She asked him all the right questions, he poured out his answers, and at the end of the evening she was tired and he acted like a man who\u2019d just put down a fifty-pound weight.</p> <p>\u201cThink you might go out with him again?\u201d Mac asked.</p><p>She gave a nod. \u201cWe\u2019re going to try sushi next Saturday night. I\u2019ve never had sushi, never eaten with chopsticks. Could be interesting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou surprise me\u2014sushi. I can\u2019t even think about eating raw fish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to try it. He says it\u2019s fun. Now really, what\u2019s up with you? I can\u2019t believe you\u2019ve just been busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelieve it. But there has been some local stuff to take care of. Cooper, for example. He\u2019s leaving tomorrow to go visit his family in New Mexico and I\u2019m going to help Rawley babysit the construction crew working on that old bait shop. You should see it, Gina\u2014it already looks like a new place. The new septic system is in, plumbing is repaired and old Coop has his fifth wheel all hooked up to sewage, water and electric. Now he doesn\u2019t have to wrestle that big old toy hauler up the hill to go dump and reload water. And he\u2019s looking for work.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s said all along that he\u2019ll settle up Ben\u2019s business, but then he has to get back to work. I imagine it means leaving Thunder Point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGee,\u201d she said, feeling a little sad. \u201cWhat about Sarah?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Gina. I don\u2019t know what their arrangement is. You\u2019d probably know more about that than me. Don\u2019t you girls talk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not enough,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>Eighteen</p> <p>Mac was not in charge of the investigation surrounding the battery domestic at the Morrisons\u2019 or the possible homicide of Ben Bailey, but he knew what was happening. He was allowed to observe interviews and look at evidence in the closed case. At the time Ben Bailey died, neither the Morrison family nor Jag Morrison and his teenage friends were even on the radar. And Ben\u2019s injuries were consistent with a fall. There was even a mark where he theoretically hit his head on the wooden stair rail.</p><p>The investigation was proving interesting, but nothing had led to a new conclusion yet. Since Cooper was leaving town to visit family, Mac borrowed Ben\u2019s old laptop.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t find anything or I would\u2019ve told you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but I want to take a look, if you don\u2019t mind. And if it\u2019s okay, I\u2019d like to borrow that Rhino of yours.\u201d</p><p>Cooper lifted one brow in question.</p><p>\u201cJust want to see how it handles on the beach, if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThinking of getting one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible,\u201d he said with a shrug, although that was the furthest thing from his mind. What really occupied him these days was Gina dating their newest resident, the doctor. Mac had no reason to dislike Scott Grant, except the thought of Gina spending time with him and kissing him really did a number on his head. He couldn\u2019t be mad, though. It was his own damn fault.</p> <p>The one great thing about winter in Oregon was that sunset was early. After dinner on Sunday, he asked Lou if she\u2019d be home for the rest of the evening.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>He struggled with what to say. In the end, he just said, \u201cBunco.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d she said. \u201cFinally.\u201d</p><p>He drove out to Coop\u2019s, loaded a couple of things in the Rhino, revved it up and took it back across the deserted beach, straight to Gina\u2019s house. Ashley answered the door.</p><p>\u201cHey, Ash,\u201d he said. \u201cCan your mother come out and play?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom!\u201d she yelled. \u201cIt\u2019s Mac.\u201d</p><p>Gina came to the door with a look of confusion on her face. Clearly he was the last person she expected. Maybe last night\u2019s sushi date was so successful she was expecting the doctor. \u201cYou busy?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s a matter of opinion. I was ironing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you take a break? Go for a ride?\u201d He turned, throwing an arm toward the Rhino, which looked like a baby Jeep.</p><p>\u201cMac, did you buy an ATV?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, it\u2019s Cooper\u2019s. I have to say, it\u2019s pretty slick. It\u2019s kind of cold, though. Grab a jacket and I\u2019ll give you a little demo ride.\u201d She didn\u2019t move right away. She just stared at him for a long moment. Behind her there was the noise of family\u2014the TV, Carrie talking to Ashley, the clinking around of dishes being loaded into the dishwasher. He could smell some kind of good meal. Having a cook in the house must be nice, he thought. \u201cCome on, Gina. The moon is huge.\u201d</p><p>She still looked a little confused, but she reached for a jacket and hollered into the house that she was going out for a while. Then she went with him, bundled up and fastened her seat belt for the ride. He took her down the street and across the beach. There was no one out there tonight, which Mac found odd. A moon like this tended to draw people, but it was Sunday night and work started early.</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d she said as they traveled across the beach, looking at the moon. \u201cIt\u2019s as beautiful as I\u2019ve ever seen it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, really lights up the place. As it rises, it\u2019s going to lose all its punch, but we have a little while to enjoy it.\u201d He stopped the Rhino in the middle of the beach, right beside the campfire he\u2019d set up on his way to pick her up. She sat in the Rhino and watched as he lit the fire; having a Duraflame made it easy.</p><p>Then he went to the back of the ATV and pulled out a couple of aluminum-and-mesh beach chairs and a blanket, setting them up so they could look at the bay and the moon over the fire. He put the chairs close, then motioned for her to get out of the Rhino. She went to one of the chairs.</p><p>\u201cYou really thought this through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot the setting so much. When I saw the moon last night, you were having sushi with the doctor.\u201d He pulled two bottles of beer from the back and held them up.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s surprisingly good, sushi. Very chichi. But I\u2019m not too adventurous. Scott will eat anything, even if it appears to wiggle.\u201d She took a beer. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>He sat down in the beach chair next to her, opened both their beers and took a bolstering slug of his. \u201cAbout Scott,\u201d he began. \u201cHow much do you like him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like him very much,\u201d she said. \u201cHe seems to be a terrific guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. Like him a lot, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said I did. Now what\u2019s this about?\u201d</p><p>He spread the blanket over them. \u201cI can admit it...that kind of threw me, you going on dates. We\u2019ve been sitting next to each other at high school football games, basketball games, hockey games, baseball games for years. I never thought you were interested in anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, didn\u2019t you?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWe even kissed once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwice,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd the next day you pronounced it a very bad idea. And said that it shouldn\u2019t happen again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, I\u2019ve never been accused of being smooth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you get some high school cheerleader knocked up if you didn\u2019t have some moves?\u201d she asked with laughter in her voice.</p><p>\u201cAh, hell, I think she had all the moves. I was just a horny dumb ox who couldn\u2019t think at all. Which is why I really wanted to think where you were concerned.\u201d He turned to look at her. \u201cI had a plan, Gina. I thought once our girls got closer to college, we\u2019d probably start seeing each other as more than just neighbors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d she asked. She took a sip of her beer. \u201cI didn\u2019t get the memo.\u201d</p><p>He laughed at her. \u201cI don\u2019t want to get in the way of anything you feel serious about, but if I\u2019m not too late...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? If you\u2019re not too late, what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you with another man, Gina.\u201d He pulled her a little closer. \u201cYou\u2019re not just a friend and neighbor to me. I\u2019ve had really strong feelings for you for years. I was just afraid of acting. If I let you down, I\u2019d never forgive myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me down, how?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d he said, running a hand over his head. \u201cI think you\u2019re going to be good at this counseling shit. If we were in a real relationship, a man/woman relationship, while our girls are best friends and if I somehow screwed it up\u2014if it didn\u2019t work out, if there was fighting and crying and a nasty, painful breakup, if the girls\u2019 friendship was hurt...\u201d He lifted her chin to look into her pretty eyes. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to start anything I couldn\u2019t control, couldn\u2019t see to the end. I couldn\u2019t stand the idea of you being unhappy with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe way Cee Jay was unhappy with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...yes.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cShe was unhappy from day one. She thought marriage was going to be some fairy tale. She thought it would make everything in her life work out, finally. But I was a scared kid, working day and night to keep us in out of the rain. And she was pregnant half the time, sick as a dog. There wasn\u2019t anything fun about it, it was horrible. And it was misery for just over six years. Then she left. Gina, I can\u2019t watch another woman go through that, and all because of me.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help it, she laughed at him, but softly, and she touched his cheek tenderly. \u201cYou\u2019re a very sweet man and I adore you, but you\u2019re not afraid of letting me down. You\u2019re afraid you\u2019ll let yourself love me and I\u2019ll leave you.\u201d</p><p>His eyes grew round for a second. \u201cI am?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cIf you stop and think for two seconds, you know how I feel about you and how you feel about me. We\u2019ve been best friends for years. But, Mac, I am goddamn sick and tired of being just your friend. And I\u2019m tired of being alone. If I have to move on\u2014\u201d</p><p>He let out a heavy breath and put both his arms around her. \u201cMe, too, Gina. Me, too. Moving on isn\u2019t what I have in mind. It\u2019s more like moving forward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you kiss me and hold me and tempt me and then tell me it\u2019s all a mistake one more time, I\u2019m going to grab that little pistol you think no one knows you carry on your ankle and just put you out of your misery. Am I clear?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cI might be better off.\u201d He leaned toward her and carefully kissed her, hanging on to his beer. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be dicey, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaving a relationship. When was the last time you were alone with a man? Really alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said, snuggling into him. \u201cIt might be fun. Like being teenagers again. Sneaking around. Looking for a place to get alone. Sex in scary places.\u201d</p><p>He leaned back and, with a facetious grin, said, \u201cSex?\u201d</p><p>She whacked him on the arm. \u201cSeriously, tell me right now if there\u2019s no sex involved in this proposition, because I\u2019ll be the one backing out. I can\u2019t remember when I last had sex. It\u2019s been a long time. I might not remember how.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoh,\u201d he said, shifting in his seat a little. \u201cI\u2019d suggest a reentry program right here, right now, but people have all these cell phones taking pictures. That\u2019s all I need.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>She giggled.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Scott? Is this going to create a problem?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMac, all Scott wants is someone to talk to. He\u2019d like to date again, get to know some women, explore whether the love of his life is really the last love of his life and he\u2019s done now. He spent our two dates talking about his late wife. He lost her less than twenty-four hours after his three-year-old daughter\u2019s birth. He\u2019s still grieving. But he\u2019s ready to move on and I\u2019m sure he asked me out because I\u2019m safe. Because he had some sense that I would listen to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGina, honey, I think you have this counseling thing pegged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I think Scott\u2019s a good man who\u2019s going to be a friend. He\u2019s kind. He\u2019s generous. He has a mother and mother-in-law who are driving him batshit crazy and that\u2019s one of the reasons he moved here.\u201d</p><p>Mac chuckled. \u201cDoes he need one old-maid aunt to add to that cast?\u201d</p><p>She nuzzled into the crook of his neck. \u201cYou smell good.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI used that girlie shower gel Lou bought me for Christmas. I figured I had one shot at this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou waited so long,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cNot on purpose. I wish to hell I had more to offer. I\u2019m a cop on a low salary with three kids and an aunt. I\u2019m looking at braces on two more mouths and three college educations. Gina, I\u2019d really like to take you places, be alone with you, court you, but honestly, it\u2019s going to be hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess we\u2019ll make out on the beach a lot,\u201d she said, not the least concerned. \u201cHave you ever fantasized about doing it in the Sheriff\u2019s Department SUV?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d he barked, making her laugh. \u201cYou know I\u2019m too straight and narrow for that.\u201d</p><p>She looked up. \u201cThat big moon just isn\u2019t going away.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you warm enough?\u201d</p><p>She put down her beer beside her chair, wrapped her arms around his neck and said, \u201cI could be warmer.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her close and covered her mouth in a hot, deep kiss. She opened her lips for him and let him in and he felt like he\u2019d gone straight to another planet. Everything inside him was on alert. He plunged long fingers into her blond hair and held her head in his hands, moving her a little this way, a little that way, deepening the kiss. She moaned beneath his lips and he let out a growl. He moved over her mouth for long seconds that stretched into minutes.</p><p>\u201cGod, you taste good,\u201d he whispered. \u201cSo this is why I worried about kissing you. I\u2019m hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m that other thing,\u201d she said. And he knew exactly what she meant. Soft where he was hard.</p><p>\u201cI could do you right now, under the blanket, take ten years of stress off your life,\u201d he offered.</p><p>She laughed at him. \u201cThanks for the selfless offer. I bet you don\u2019t even have protection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. I bought it in Coquille, too, so I wouldn\u2019t find myself standing next to Cliff in the drugstore, buying condoms. I have one in my pocket. It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve had a condom in my pocket in over ten years.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe we can sneak away sometime this week, while everyone we live with is at work or school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow,\u201d he said, kissing her some more.</p><p>\u201cAh, tomorrow. You call the sheriff and tell him you need a little personal time. I\u2019ll tell Stu I need twenty minutes to run an errand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwenty minutes?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been at least as long for me,\u201d she said. \u201cMac, are you sure this time?\u201d</p><p>He pulled back a little so he could look into her eyes. \u201cGina, I\u2019ve been in love with you for years. I\u2019m sorry about three years ago. You should\u2019ve whacked me over the head with a frying pan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t, you see,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought it was possible you just wanted to be friends. As friends go, you\u2019ve always been there for me. I couldn\u2019t give that up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll always be your friend,\u201d he said. \u201cYour best friend, if you let me. But I want to be your lover, too.\u201d He groaned and shifted in his chair. \u201cSoon. I want to be that soon.\u201d Then a look came over him. \u201cOh, Gina...I didn\u2019t even court you! God, I should date you first before I beg you to take off your clothes!\u201d</p><p>She pulled his mouth back on hers, kissing him soundly. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Mac. I\u2019m ready. I\u2019ve been ready for a long time.\u201d She kissed him again. \u201cAnd promise to use that sexy bodywash again.\u201d</p><p>He leaned his forehead against hers. \u201cWill you go steady with me?\u201d</p><p>Less than twenty-four hours later, at two in the afternoon, a mere hour and a half before school let out, Gina was in Mac\u2019s bed. They went to Mac\u2019s house because his place wasn\u2019t at the center of town like Gina\u2019s. He was waiting for her when she pulled into his driveway and it took them roughly forty-five seconds to tear each other\u2019s clothes off and fall onto the bed, exploring each other with hungry fingers and devouring each other with starving kisses.</p><p>And then she laughed.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019m a tough guy, but is this funny?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cHilarious. A week ago, we were driving our girls to practices, sitting next to each other at games, never so much as holding hands, and here we are, naked. About sixteen hours after you make up your mind that you can handle having a girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>He ran a finger around the elastic of her panties. \u201cWell, I\u2019m naked, but you\u2019re not there yet. And it only took sixteen hours because you wouldn\u2019t do it under the blanket.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose days of doing it under a blanket or in a backseat are long gone. I hope. Listen, if Aunt Lou has to sew a couple of buttons back on your uniform, promise not to tell her I was ripping your clothes off.\u201d</p><p>He laughed then, too. \u201cThere are obviously things about Aunt Lou you don\u2019t know. She\u2019d probably give me a prize if she knew this was happening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust so we\u2019re clear...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe should go slower,\u201d he said.</p><p>She wiggled against him. \u201cI think that ship has sailed.\u201d She glanced over at his bedside clock. \u201cWe\u2019re down to an hour and fifteen minutes.\u201d</p><p>He must\u2019ve taken that as invitation because he pulled off those panties and was poised above her, ready, stirring her up with the tip of his erection. Her response was to open her legs a little wider for him.</p><p>\u201cTell me what to do, honey,\u201d he said. \u201cTell me where to touch you. How to touch you. Because the most important thing in my life right now is making you come hard.\u201d</p><p>So she did as he asked, pulling him inside, directing his fingers to her clitoris. And he said, \u201cOh, God. Oh, my God.\u201d</p><p>He stroked her and thrust exactly twice and she exploded, gripping him so tightly she hoped she didn\u2019t actually hurt him. And what a blessing, because he followed her immediately, emitting a large groan and shuddering with his release. As he regained control he said, \u201cWe\u2019ll never get work making porn films.\u201d</p><p>She held him close, trying to breathe evenly.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he said. \u201cI love you, baby. I\u2019ve loved you a long time.\u201d</p><p>And she cried. Laughing one minute, crying the next.</p><p>\u201cHoney?\u201d he asked, brushing her hair back.</p><p>She tried to cover her face because she was mortified. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she whispered. \u201cSo emotional. I never thought I\u2019d cry.\u201d But tears ran from her eyes into her hair.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, sweetheart? Was I too rough? Did I hurt you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Mac, no. I...\u201d She needed a few moments to compose herself. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, it was just that...I thought I might never have this in my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeen a long time, huh, baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa.\u201d She sniffed. \u201cThis is the first time, Mac. There have only been two guys in my life\u2014Ashley\u2019s father, who only said he loved me to get in my pants when I was all of fifteen and one other guy I dated for a little while, but we both knew immediately we weren\u2019t right for each other. I\u2019ve never had a man I loved like this. God, I wondered if I ever would.\u201d</p><p>He wiped the tears from her cheeks, smiled and held her close. \u201cYou have one now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone will know,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s that kind of town. Will that bother you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI got Deputy Yummy Pants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, so you want to add spanking to this tryst,\u201d he said. \u201cWho knew you were kinky...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll these girls and women want you, and you really want me?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He nodded and brushed back her hair again. \u201cBecause you\u2019re the best.\u201d</p><p>Mac was resting in his quiet room, a Lab on each side of his chair, fire lit, his feet up and a book in his lap. A book he wasn\u2019t reading. He was feeling more at peace than he had in years and just prayed his cell phone wouldn\u2019t buzz or chime with some problem in town, because he just wanted to float on this cloud for a while. The afternoon was too short. He wanted more of Gina. He wanted to whisper to her, make love to her, feel her beautiful trim body close to his....</p><p>\u201cDad? Got a minute?\u201d Eve asked.</p><p>He opened his eyes. \u201cSure,\u201d he said, sitting up in the recliner and closing the book that was little more than a prop anyway. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>She sat down on the sofa right across from him. \u201cAshley called. She said you and her mom...\u201d She bit her lower lip.</p><p>\u201cWhat, Eve?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe said you and Gina are now going together. Boyfriend and girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d he said.</p><p>Well, one of the things they\u2019d talked about before getting back into clothes was that their families shouldn\u2019t be the last to know. But also that they didn\u2019t need to know everything.</p><p>\u201cI guess that\u2019s right,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that\u2019s been coming a long time. Gina and I have been really close for years. We decided if we\u2019re honest, we\u2019re more than friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean, exactly? More than friends?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cIt means we like each other more romantically than just neighbors. Kind of like Landon isn\u2019t just a friend, he\u2019s your boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sleeping together? Having sex?\u201d</p><p>He actually felt his cheeks get hot, but he\u2019d be damned if he\u2019d cave in to a sixteen-year-old girl. He valiantly held his ground. \u201cAre you sleeping with Landon? Having sex?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course not! But I\u2019m sixteen and we\u2019ve only known each other since school started. You\u2019re thirty-six and\u2014\u201d</p><p>At least she didn\u2019t say she\u2019d had sex years ago. \u201cAnd?\u201d he asked, lifting an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cAnd I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve ever had a girlfriend! Or even gone on dates.\u201d</p><p>He laughed a little. \u201cYou\u2019re right, Eve. But Gina and I have been friends for years, know each other very well, and I think she\u2019s a good woman. I hope to start taking her on dates. Is there a problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, how are Ash and I supposed to act with this new thing going on?\u201d</p><p>He shot her a perplexed look. \u201cSame as always?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s weird!\u201d</p><p>He leaned back and put his feet up. He tried not to laugh. \u201cYou\u2019ll get used to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what if you get married and divorced?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He sat up straight again. \u201cOh, for God\u2019s sake, Eve! Can we go out on two dates before you have us married and divorced?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell? What if?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy the time all that can happen, you\u2019ll probably have already had your own marriage and divorce!\u201d he blurted.</p><p>\u201cThat is not funny!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought it was kind of funny,\u201d he grumbled. \u201cI\u2019m just saying, aside from the fact that I hope to spend a little more time with Gina, there are no plans in the works to change the lives of everyone in our families.\u201d He snorted. \u201cYou\u2019d think a person could get a little support around here.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cI just think it\u2019s weird,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I bet you\u2019re having sex!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet you\u2019re not going to find me willing to discuss my sex life with you in this lifetime,\u201d he snapped back.</p> <p>\u201cYou mean you have a sex life?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cFor the love of Christ,\u201d he muttered. \u201cLou! Where\u2019s your aunt Lou?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s watching Designing Women reruns in her bedroom,\u201d Eve said. \u201cDoes she know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure she does,\u201d he said. \u201cListen, take it easy. I don\u2019t see how my life or your life is going to change much if I\u2019m dating Gina. We\u2019ll still do all the school things together, I\u2019ll still have coffee with her at the diner when I\u2019m free, we\u2019ll still have some holidays together, but I might get to hold her hand sometimes or put my arm around her or...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr?\u201d she asked, arching one judgmental brow at him.</p> <p>\u201cOr make out like rock stars, like you and Landon do! You know, if I\u2019d given you this much static about dating someone, you would\u2019ve gone ballistic! Why doesn\u2019t anyone tell single fathers about raising teenage girls? What\u2019s the matter with you? You love Gina!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t want our family to go through another big, horrible thing\u2014moving, starting over, all that. Don\u2019t you remember?\u201d</p><p>God, he thought. She remembers?</p><p>\u201cOf course I remember,\u201d he said. \u201cHoney, you were only six when your mom left and what you probably don\u2019t remember is that she was very young and very unhappy. Gina\u2019s no kid. She\u2019s very stable and sensible. And she loves you. I\u2019m sorry about your mom, but I did everything I could.\u201d</p><p>Big tears welled up in her eyes, but didn\u2019t fall. \u201cI know,\u201d she said.</p><p>Mac cursed himself. He could be an idiot on so many levels. It had never occurred to him that a relationship might frighten Eve, that she still had some residual trauma from losing her mother the way she did.</p> <p>He got up, went to the couch, sat next to her and put an arm around her. \u201cListen, honey, you have nothing to worry about. Everything is going to be fine. Gina\u2019s a good person, I\u2019m a good person. Both of us put our kids first. Try to relax and enjoy seeing everyone happy. Maybe I finally found someone to sit in the truck with me while I spy on you kids on the beach, huh?\u201d</p><p>She gave a little huff of laughter. \u201cKind of took me by surprise,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why. We\u2019ve been best friends for years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, best friends going nowhere. I never saw this coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019re just about the only one. Word I got around town is that people were wondering what was taking me so long.\u201d He gave her a squeeze and laughed. \u201cI know we tend to disagree sometimes...wildly disagree sometimes. But you should know I\u2019d never do anything that would risk your sense of security. Your needs have always come first, Eve. You, Ryan and Dee Dee\u2014always first.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cBut, angel, your old dad can use a little companionship, too.\u201d</p><p>She leaned against him and said, \u201cI guess.\u201d He smiled to himself. She thought he was older than dirt. At thirty-six!</p><p>\u201cIs Ash all worked up about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. She thinks it\u2019s very cool. She said if we play our cards right, we can be sisters. Real sisters.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOr, without playing any cards at all, you can be as close as sisters for as long as you want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that,\u201d she said, snuggling closer.</p><p>He held his little girl for a while, remembering too well what she was like right after Cee Jay left, how she cried and wet the bed, how she rushed home from school every day to see if her mother had come home, how she stopped playing with the other kids on the playground but had an elaborate fantasy life in her bedroom with her dolls, playacting all kinds of complex scenarios about missing mothers. He took her to some counseling available through social services and she came around, adjusting to their strange life of a dad, three kids and aunt. He had to quit one of his jobs, move in with Lou, juggle a million things\u2014but it worked. Finally there was no fighting, no angst, no crying.</p><p>And he got used to being lonely.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to be lonely anymore.</p><p>An hour later Lou passed through the living room holding a cup of tea. \u201cIt\u2019s going to require a short period of adjustment. It\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEither you heard or she told you,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cA little of both,\u201d she said with a shrug. \u201cI\u2019m glad you and Gina are being honest. I can say, from experience, keeping secrets really never works.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLou, do I need to talk to her about sex?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, for the love of God! Really, Mac, whether you\u2019re having sex is none of her\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that, Lou, not that. She\u2019s sixteen. She\u2019s beautiful. She\u2019s got a boyfriend. We\u2019ve had some talks but I don\u2019t want Eve at risk.\u201d He rubbed his chin. \u201cIt\u2019s not my idea of a good time, but I can do it.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at him. \u201cGotcha covered, Yummy.\u201d He frowned darkly and she sat on the couch. \u201cEve and I have had many talks. She understands her parents were hot to trot and got started a little too young and even though the result was three beautiful children, too young can be too hard and can end badly. I told her if she ever wants to visit my gynecologist, a very kind and discreet woman, I will make an appointment, no questions asked. Eve\u2019s a very smart girl and she has high standards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean to just leave those kinds of things with you, Lou.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But I know how kids think, probably better than you do. And girls usually feel more comfortable talking to women. But by all means, if you want to have that discussion...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might,\u201d he said. \u201cI might. Not right away, though. Right now she\u2019s a little freaked-out to think of me dating her best friend\u2019s mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, Mac, this is a good problem. Eve will be fine. Just take a breather, huh? Try and enjoy life a little. Don\u2019t overthink this and mess up a good thing. You\u2019ve put your life on hold for a lot of years and you have my admiration. But really, any longer and you\u2019d become a stoic.\u201d</p><p>Nineteen</p><p>Cooper had a good visit with his family. He knew he had inconvenienced them by showing up two weeks before Christmas when everyone was very busy. But his three sisters, their husbands, two nieces and two nephews managed to coordinate a number of short visits here and there, and two big family meals at his parents\u2019 house. When it was just the adults gathered around the table after dinner, he told them about the bait shop and the renovation he was undertaking so he could sell. He didn\u2019t say how much land was attached.</p><p>Then he told them he\u2019d been seeing someone.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t at that precise moment that he realized the reality of his situation with Sarah, but that nudged him ever closer to the truth. He privately acknowledged that, like a teenage boy, he had to talk to her every day. He texted her little snippets and phoned her at night. The only time she didn\u2019t answer his call was when she was flying, and then she called him back.</p><p>He needed her.</p><p>When he got back to Thunder Point he was already up to speed on the local gossip. The recent romantic development between Mac and Gina had Sarah\u2019s attention, but Cooper had been more interested in the ongoing situation with the Morrison family. From rumor, it sounded like that family had imploded, leaving behind an empty house surrounded by an ostentatious fence. Foreclosed, the rumor went.</p><p>Sarah was working when Cooper got back, so he checked in with the deputy. When he stopped in the small, storefront office, Mac was on the phone, so he waited patiently by the door. He noticed Ben\u2019s old laptop sitting on the desk. Then the deputy put down the phone and stood up.</p><p>\u201cWelcome back,\u201d he said, smiling and sticking out his hand.</p><p>\u201cSo, I turn my back for five minutes and you decide to improve on your love life,\u201d Cooper said, extending his own hand.</p><p>\u201cWell hell, they don\u2019t call me speedy for nothing.\u201d</p><p>Cooper let out a laugh. \u201cThey call you\u2014\u201d</p><p>Mac put up a hand. \u201cFriends don\u2019t let friends say dangerous things.\u201d</p><p>Cooper grinned. \u201cIt\u2019s good to be back. Did you run off the Morrison clan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to take credit for that, but I think they just came to the end of the line. It\u2019s been no secret that business hasn\u2019t been so good for brokers and developers around the state but I think the consensus was that Puck had more money than he knew what to do with and was untouched by the recession. Puck left first. He\u2019s back in Eugene. His sons by his first marriage might\u2019ve taken him in. Then Mrs. Morrison and Jag moved on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo the town bully isn\u2019t in town anymore?\u201d Cooper asked.</p><p>\u201cThe only thing I can really tell you about that is that he was instructed to make amends to Landon in order to get back into Thunder Point High and he refused, so his suspension turned into an expulsion. That doesn\u2019t mean he isn\u2019t around. Continued vigilance is recommended.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he get into any trouble over that domestic? Hitting his dad?\u201d Cooper asked.</p><p>\u201cHis court date is coming up. This will be his second offense and while he might not get the punishment he deserves, it\u2019s pretty damn clear he\u2019s a violent kid. And his badass self is almost eighteen. I don\u2019t think the court is going to pamper him. And the next time he pulls something, it\u2019s going to be bleak for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s something, I guess,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cJesus, what\u2019s the matter with that imbecile? He must have grown up with ten times what most of the other kids around here have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe that\u2019s what\u2019s the matter with him,\u201d Mac said. \u201cI spend a lot of time feeling rotten that I can\u2019t give my kids more. Maybe I should rethink all that guilt. Maybe they\u2019re better off. At least they\u2019re not ungrateful little bastards.\u201d Then he laughed. \u201cIt takes so little to make them happy. I\u2019m going to work on remembering that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have good kids, Mac,\u201d Cooper said. He nodded toward the laptop. \u201cFind anything on there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gave it to a forensic IT unit the department uses and they went through it and made a copy of the hard drive. I hope you gave permission for that because I said you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. But why didn\u2019t you do that in the first place?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cHomicide and the coroner and the assistant D.A. went through the bait shop, and there was a postmortem. There was no evidence of foul play.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cAnd I have no idea if they found anything on the laptop, but their team can look at even the deleted and destroyed material. They\u2019re spooky.\u201d He lifted the laptop and opened it. \u201cI did find something. I wondered if you noticed it, too.\u201d</p><p>He leaned a hip on the desk, balanced the laptop on his thigh and fired it up. He opened it and scrolled through email. It took a few minutes and he muttered, \u201cGetting there...\u201d Then he said, \u201cAh! Got it. He saved this. Do you remember this? It\u2019s four years old and might explain a few things about this arrangement you have with your friend\u2019s bait shop.\u201d</p><p>He turned the laptop around and handed it to Cooper.</p><p>I think I\u2019ve had about enough of this place. Time to head out and find something new. I think I\u2019d rather have an eagle\u2019s nest than a lot of corporate bullshit. Coop</p><p>Wandering yet again?</p><p>That seems to be my MO. I get restless real easy.</p><p>But don\u2019t they pay you a lot of money? Why not just do the job for a few more years for the money? Find a place to settle down. They give you bonuses. Trust me, the eagles aren\u2019t real big on bonuses! Ben</p><p>I don\u2019t know. Chasing money for the sake of money... It\u2019s soulless. There\u2019s got to be more to life than that.

Even a little piece of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that was the point of the email. We all knew Ben wasn\u2019t much for chasing money. Did you know there\u2019s at least one eagle\u2019s nest out there on the point?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen the eagles, and I remember Ben telling me he had a nest\u2014he was proud of that. They\u2019re built in those rocky precipices out there. But I went all the way out to the point and looked over the edge, and I couldn\u2019t see anything\u2014it\u2019s all rocky all the way down to the water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I don\u2019t think you can get a boat up close. Those waves against the rocks will take you out. But I think maybe Ben saved this email because of the thing about money. It\u2019s clear that money isn\u2019t the only thing that drives you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell now, we don\u2019t know that for sure yet,\u201d Cooper said with a laugh. \u201cThat\u2019s easier to say when you have enough to live on forever. And I don\u2019t. Believe me.\u201d He closed the laptop. \u201cSo, you\u2019re done with this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all yours. Want a cup of coffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be good. Across the street?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t look too busy over there,\u201d Mac said.</p><p>Cooper looked at his watch. \u201cI have a little time. I want to run by the store. I\u2019m cooking for Sarah and Landon tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLandon? Landon who?\u201d Mac asked with a laugh. \u201cYou mean that quarterback who lives at my house now?\u201d</p><p>Cooper rarely made any kind of a big deal over Christmas. Sometimes he went back to Albuquerque to spend time with the family, but he gave gift cards, not a lot of fussy presents. Those times he had girlfriends, he knew exactly what to give them\u2014jewelry. The seriousness of the girlfriend determined the level of jewelry. For a girl you\u2019re dating but not deeply involved with, a spa package or gift certificate. In years past, he always skipped the company party. Occasionally coworkers had informal gatherings he sometimes attended. Hanging out with fellow pilots could be entertaining.</p><p>In Thunder Point it was a little different. First of all, people seemed to take turns entertaining, but nothing flashy. Lou and Mac had an open house and invited their local friends, who turned out to be half the town. Women wore Christmas sweaters with Santa or reindeer on them, men came in green-and-red sweaters and wool pants as opposed to jeans. For the first time in his life, Cooper asked a woman to dress him. He knew better than to show up in one of his hand-me-down suits or his jeans.</p><p>Sarah picked through his closet, pulled out some dark pants, a starched shirt, no tie, taupe V-neck sweater and the black shoes he almost never wore. \u201cThis will work,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Carrie and Gina James had a gathering with the same theme. Their party featured meatballs, hot dips, cookies, fancy little cakes, and some outstanding bite-size crab and Parmesan hors d\u2019oeuvres.</p><p>\u201cIf you eat any more of those, you\u2019re going to make yourself sick,\u201d Sarah said.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t stop,\u201d he said.</p><p>Stu held his party at the diner one night, then Cliff had a free happy hour at Cliffhanger\u2019s with punch for the younger set. Again, there were a lot of Christmas sweaters and pressed black pants. Cooper made every event and, to his surprise, had a wonderful time. Well, except maybe for a while at Cliffhanger\u2019s when Ray Anne had a little too much to drink and Cooper drove her home. He had to lift her into his truck. She made a drunken suggestion that they \u201cdo it\u201d just for the Christmas spirit and when he said that wouldn\u2019t work for him, she accepted that and said, \u201cWell, then at least sign those agent papers for me, Hank!\u201d</p><p>He hurried back to Cliff\u2019s so no one would assume...</p><p>The Coast Guard did not sleep on holidays, so Sarah couldn\u2019t make all the parties, but she hit a few. For Cooper, it was nice to have someone as classy and sweet as Sarah on his arm. But come Christmas Eve, she was scheduled to work. She\u2019d have to be at the Coast Guard station, ready to fly if anyone needed rescue.</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t be the first time Landon and I had to adjust for holidays. Maybe the McCains will include him. I get off Christmas morning, so I\u2019ll be around for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me,\u201d Cooper said.</p> <p>\u201cLet you what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stay at your house Christmas Eve. If he has somewhere to go, fine. I\u2019ll be there when he gets home. Then we\u2019ll have Christmas morning together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it make you nervous to have me over on Christmas morning?\u201d he asked her. \u201cBecause I can be useful. I know how to cook. I know how to clean up better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, it\u2019s that whole family thing. I worry about Landon thinking of himself as a part of a relationship, the way he did with Derek. He\u2019s only sixteen. He doesn\u2019t realize that we\u2019re close but not serious.\u201d</p><p>Cooper laughed at her. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Sarah. Landon hasn\u2019t thought about anyone but Eve in weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess that\u2019s right,\u201d she said, laughing with him.</p><p>So Cooper and Landon both went to the McCains for Christmas Eve where they ate seafood fresh from the marina and played poker until midnight. Eve pouted because she\u2019d rather have had Landon\u2019s undivided attention, Mac roared his agony at drawing such bad cards, Cooper laughed his ass off and Lou took it all home.</p><p>And then came Christmas morning.</p><p>Bachelors like Cooper enjoyed holidays and were not overly sentimental about them. Sarah was somewhere between a spa package girlfriend and a jewelry girlfriend, mostly because she was so reluctant to let herself get involved. He understood a lot of this had to do with Landon. To that end, he had selected the perfect presents for both of them.</p><p>Early Christmas morning, after spending a night on Sarah\u2019s couch, he got up, fed the dog, wrote Landon a note and said he was running an errand and would be right back. He thought the kid would probably sleep late. In fact, Sarah might get home and read the note before Cooper got back.</p><p>He drove down the road to the beach, but he stopped at the marina. The boats were firing up. It was barely sunrise. It looked like a lot of the fishermen and a few crabbers were going out on Christmas morning. It hit him suddenly, these people had no choice. He\u2019d known that, of course, but hadn\u2019t given it so much thought. He didn\u2019t know any of the men well and in fact the ones he\u2019d met were the merest of acquaintances. He knew, however, that most of them worked their fathers\u2019 and grandfathers\u2019 and brothers\u2019 boats. Maybe they loved their work, but even if they didn\u2019t, it was their means of living.</p><p>But Cooper, always a loner, had had choices. He had never had to make long-term commitments or stay in jobs that weren\u2019t satisfying. All he had to do was take care of himself.</p><p>Watching those boats go out early Christmas morning, he felt a sense of envy. People depended on those men. They had families to take care of. He\u2019d almost married twice and yet had never felt that sense of responsibility.</p><p>From where he sat in his truck, he could see the toy hauler. He\u2019d lived in apartments, on a boat for two years, in his trailer\u2014anything that he could uproot quickly and easily.</p><p>He put the truck in gear and headed across the beach. Inside the shed, along with Ben\u2019s old truck and RZR 800\u2014his Razor\u2014were two top-of-the-line paddleboards, oars and two boxes. He\u2019d cleaned up and gassed Ben\u2019s Razor, then he laid the boards across the back where a cooler might sit and fastened them in. The boxes went in the seat next to the driver. He laughed at himself\u2014expert wrapper, he was not. There was a wide, red ribbon around each board and the plain white boxes had the identical ribbon. No paper, no froufrous, as his mom called them. He might be able to wear the hell out of a hand-me-down suit and buy some real top-notch toys, but he just was not good with wrapping presents.</p><p>He thought, however, that Landon was going to go nuts for this one. And Sarah, being a beach girl at heart, would probably be happy, too. Nothing had ever felt better.</p><p>He drove the Razor across the beach and up to Sarah\u2019s house. Her SUV was parked in the driveway, so he pulled up behind it. In the kitchen was Sarah, still in her flight suit but in her stocking feet.</p><p>\u201cHey, thanks for making coffee,\u201d she said, stirring cream and sugar into a cup. \u201cI\u2019m going to need a nap today. We went out last night. Some folks on a Christmas Eve yacht ride got in a little trouble with some rocks. And booze, I\u2019m thinking. What did you guys do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoker,\u201d he said, taking the coffee from her hands and pulling her against him for a delicious morning kiss. He went after her mouth like a starving man and realized that he wanted to wake up like that every morning.</p><p>When he let go of her, she laughed. \u201cPoker? Are you corrupting my brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit, he had things to teach me. But Lou took the pot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood for her. How about some breakfast? I\u2019m all stocked up\u2014eggs, sausage, bacon, sweet rolls. We can do omelets or take \u2019em straight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet you\u2019re starving,\u201d he said. \u201cCan you wait fifteen minutes if I cook?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, but I don\u2019t want you stuck with cooking for the whole day. You already promised dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDinner\u2019s easy. Hell, breakfast is easy. Go wake up Landon\u2014I have something for him. For you, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, we talked about this. We\u2019re not doing a big deal for presents. Just a little something, that\u2019s all. Nothing big. You agreed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSarah, don\u2019t start complaining until you know if you have something to complain about. Get the kid. He\u2019s had enough sleep\u2014he wiped me out last night.\u201d</p><p>She patted his cheek. \u201cAll right, but you better have kept your word.\u201d</p><p>Okay, he thought. So she\u2019ll lecture him a little bit later. He was a big boy, he could deal with that.</p><p>Landon stumbled out of his bedroom in a pair of sweats, no shirt, bare feet, his hair all wonky and sticking up all over the place. Like a little kid, he rubbed his eyes. Like a kid with stubble on his cheeks. \u201cWhat, Cooper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got you and Sarah a Christmas present and it\u2019s in the driveway.\u201d</p><p>His eyes opened for that.</p><p>\u201cOh, if you\u2019ve done anything crazy...\u201d Sarah warned.</p><p>He slipped an arm around her waist. \u201cTake it easy, it\u2019s not what you think.\u201d And they followed Landon outside.</p><p>The cold didn\u2019t bother Landon at all, even in bare feet. The ribbons gave it away\u2014he went straight to the boards. He yelped, \u201cWoo-hoo! Sarah, look at this! Woo-hoo!\u201d</p><p>She turned to look up at him. She smiled when she said, \u201cCooper, that\u2019s too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do what I want,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t follow directions very well.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a squeeze. \u201cI thought that was your favorite part.\u201d To Landon he said, \u201cBy March, you\u2019ll be out there on the bay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah!\u201d he said, lifting one of the boards off the back of the Razor.</p><p>\u201cThere are two boxes in the front seat to put under the tree,\u201d Cooper added. \u201cAnd this,\u201d he said, wrestling the keys from his pocket. \u201cI\u2019ll need a ride home later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Landon and Sarah said at the same time.</p><p>\u201cIt was Ben\u2019s. I think he\u2019d like it if you had it. It\u2019s far from new, but it seems to be in good shape. I sure don\u2019t need it and I\u2019m not going to sell it. And here\u2019s a tip\u2014Rawley is good on engines and restoration if you need that. Let\u2019s get those boxes.\u201d</p><p>The boxes in the front seat of the Razor didn\u2019t make it under the tree. Landon, a little beside himself, tore the ribbon off the top box, threw off the lid and held up a wet suit. \u201cHoly crap!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d Cooper muttered. \u201cHe\u2019s completely out of control sometimes.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>She looked up at him and said, \u201cWhat have you done?\u201d</p><p>He turned her toward him. \u201cI did what I thought might make a good Christmas for you and Landon.

He mixed up cheesy potatoes from the box, got his green bean casserole ready, rolls from Carrie\u2019s deli were on the counter and the ham was on the counter, coming to room temperature for later.

And so Cooper was able to exercise his greatest desire by sneaking into Sarah\u2019s bedroom and curving around her small, sleeping form, pulling her close.</p><p>She turned in his arms and faced him, blinking open her eyes. \u201cI bought you a sweater and you bought us a vehicle and a couple of paddleboards and wet suits worth many hundreds of dollars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBest Christmas of my life,\u201d he said, kissing her forehead.</p><p>\u201cBest Christmas of Landon\u2019s life, for sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to spend months praying for an early spring,\u201d Cooper said.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re getting too involved,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re staying too afraid,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be okay, Sarah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me.\u201d</p><p>A few days after Christmas, Sarah and Cooper met Mac and Gina for a nice dinner at Cliffhanger\u2019s, their first official double date\u2014no aunts, mothers, kids or dogs.</p><p>\u201cI never thought I\u2019d see the day,\u201d Gina said.</p> <p>\u201cThere certainly aren\u2019t enough of them,\u201d Sarah agreed.</p><p>\u201cWell, listen, I realize this is very last-minute,\u201d Gina said. \u201cWe\u2019re having a New Year\u2019s Eve thing at the house. It\u2019s for the kids, really. It\u2019s a way of keeping Eve and Ashley from doing something stupid with their stupid boyfriends, no offense, Sarah. They can invite a few friends, we\u2019ll lay in some food and the chaperones can play poker or something. You\u2019re invited, if you\u2019re interested.\u201d</p><p>Cooper grabbed Sarah\u2019s hand under the table. He pulled her toward him and whispered in her ear. \u201cSay no, I beg of you.\u201d</p><p>She whispered back. \u201cWhat\u2019s my excuse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlans,\u201d he said. \u201cJust say no and I\u2019ll make you come three times on New Year\u2019s Eve. Three times.\u201d</p><p>Her face went red as a tomato. She looked at their friends and said, \u201cUm, Cooper has plans for me.\u201d</p><p>As Cooper was taking her home, she said, \u201cAll right, Mr. Big Shot, what kind of plans do we have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d he said. \u201cAnything you want. I\u2019ll put on my expensive hand-me-down suit and take you out somewhere special. Or we can throw a couple of pizzas in the oven and eat them naked. I just want you, by yourself, not a bunch of teenagers. And it\u2019s not like I don\u2019t like teenagers, it\u2019s just that...you know...I want to make you scream my name a few times. That work for you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve never eaten pizza naked,\u201d she told him.</p><p>That was good enough for him and for the next couple of days he could barely contain himself. He had come to a few conclusions and it was time to level with Sarah. That email Mac came across, that wasn\u2019t about money or eagles. That was about stability. About roots. He envied people with responsibility; he wanted a stronger connection and wasn\u2019t sure how that happened. Until now. Until Sarah.</p><p>She came to him for their private New Year\u2019s Eve party. It was still early in the evening and the first thing he did, right after locking the door, was to peel her clothes off as he walked her to the bedroom, leaving a trail of them along the way. He thought he was very accomplished, kissing her as he undressed her and himself, landing them on the bed, almost naked, where he made fast work of what was left of her clothing. And his.</p><p>He kissed her whole body until she begged him to get inside her. He was feeling so sure of himself and so powerful he said, \u201cI meant it. I can make you come three times if you want me to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce, for right now, should do the trick,\u201d she told him.</p><p>He grabbed for the little foil package on his bedside table and said, \u201cAnything you want, honey. Anything. Just tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about less talking and more doing.\u201d</p><p>He took instruction well, covering her mouth in a powerful kiss that curled her toes and made her moan. It hadn\u2019t taken any time at all to know her body, to respond to her needs and desires, to find out exactly how to satisfy her. He could tell whether she wanted it fast and hard or slow and drawn out...and he delivered. Once he was inside her body, he knew the way and he knew the sounds that signaled she was ready. And that she was there.</p><p>He held himself back until he felt her clench and spasm around him, then he waited her out and wouldn\u2019t let himself go until she was complete. Sometimes when he emptied himself into her, it started a whole new orgasm for her. Like tonight. He held her tight, one arm under her shoulders, one large hand pressing her bottom against him, getting him deeper, his mouth on her mouth, claiming her.</p><p>\u201cAw, God,\u201d he groaned. \u201cGod, Sarah,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>And she ran fingers along the hair at his temples. \u201cCooper, one of these days I think you\u2019re going to kill me.\u201d</p><p>It took him a moment to catch his breath, but once he was in control again he said, \u201cSarah. Listen, Sarah. I love you.\u201d</p><p>And she turned her face away.</p><p>Cooper couldn\u2019t move. He was frozen in place, and he was still joined to her. He slowly touched the hair at her brow and gave them both a moment. Then with care, he rolled away from her, but he gathered her into his arms and pulled her close to him.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Sarah, it\u2019s time. Talk to me.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t move except to slowly stroke his hand for a moment.</p><p>With a thumb and forefinger to her chin, he turned her back to look at him. \u201cI think you better tell me what he did to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know. He cheated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh-ho,\u201d he said on a humorless laugh, \u201cI think there was more to it than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, he cheated with the maid of honor on the day of the wedding.\u201d His expression registered flat, in total disbelief. \u201cJust when you think you\u2019ve heard it all, right?\u201d</p><p>He was speechless. The only thing that came to mind was What kind of man? And yet... \u201cSarah, you married him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d she said, giving a nod. \u201cI suspected that day. I knew in my gut that very day, but he convinced me something that egregious couldn\u2019t be true. I didn\u2019t hear the truth until my ex-friend, my bridesmaid, decided to unburden herself a year later. And he came clean. He said he probably wasn\u2019t cut out to be monogamous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, baby,\u201d he said, pulling her closer. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be sorry. You\u2019re guiltless.\u201d</p><p>He realized she was pushing against him a bit, so he let her put a little space between them. \u201cI think there\u2019s more. I can\u2019t imagine it, but I think there\u2019s more.\u201d</p><p>She lifted those large dark eyes to his. He could hear the tears in her voice, but she wouldn\u2019t let herself cry. Her eyes didn\u2019t even cloud with tears. \u201cI loved him,\u201d she said. \u201cI really did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must have.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cVery much. It was completely crazy how much. From the second I saw him.\u201d</p><p>Cooper frowned darkly. There was a great deal missing from this explanation and he was a little afraid to hear it, but he knew it better come out. \u201cI want to know everything,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to understand this.\u201d</p><p>She took a breath. \u201cIt feels very strange. We\u2019re so...naked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter to keep from covering up, I think. You can trust me with it, Sarah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI loved him,\u201d she said again. \u201cI met him at work. One look and I was attracted and then he asked me if I\u2019d go out with him. Of course I\u2019d go out with him\u2014he was so hot, so sexy, so beautiful. But I had Landon, I explained. And he said, \u2018Let\u2019s all go out.\u2019 He took Landon and me to a great restaurant. Then he went to watch Landon play football twice before we even had a private date together. Does any of this sound familiar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike us?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cCan you see why I\u2019m not letting anything like that happen to me again? Derek even lavished Landon with gifts, went to every game, stayed at my house while I had to sit alert...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not him.\u201d He lifted her chin with a finger. \u201cSarah, you know I\u2019m nothing like him. Besides, you didn\u2019t love me on sight.\u201d He grinned lamely.</p><p>\u201cCooper, I was really just a kid when I lost my parents. I had a little brother to raise and he was so small, so vulnerable. I don\u2019t mean to sound like a baby myself, but it was hard. Sometimes I was so isolated, so afraid I\u2019d never get the hang of this\u2014like a single mom, thrown into the deep end of the pool. And then along comes this man I thought was wonderful and just having him there for us, for the first time in so many years I thought we could be a real family. I thought maybe I\u2019d have a normal life, after all. I was thirty the first time I had a glimpse of a normal life. I was sleeping with a man I loved. Not only was I in a stable relationship, so was Landon. We were finally safe. I started to have hopes and dreams for the first time since I was in college. I started to fantasize about a family of my own\u2014not only a safe place for Landon to grow up and thrive, but maybe a child of my own someday. And I had that for a year, Cooper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSarah...\u201d</p><p>\u201cCooper, I know how to lose a guy\u2014I\u2019ve had brief relationships here and there that didn\u2019t make it and I survived, Landon and I survived. But this time I had dreams. He didn\u2019t just let me down. He let Landon down, too. He didn\u2019t just break my heart, Cooper. He killed all my dreams.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI can\u2019t go through that again.\u201d</p><p>He looked into those dark, liquid eyes for a long moment. Then he pulled her closer and kissed her lightly. \u201cYou won\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not taking that chance, you know. I\u2019m not letting myself love anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t blame you. But I\u2019m not him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, and it\u2019s not your fault that you\u2019re stuck with this. It\u2019s his fault, the bastard. He probably screwed this up for you. I apologize. But that\u2019s how it is.\u201d</p><p>Twenty</p><p>January was a cloudy and wet month, typical for the coast at this time of year. Sarah had a weeklong training class to attend in Florida. She was hesitant to allow Cooper to be in charge of Landon because of the way it resembled her relationship with her ex. But Cooper made a good case. \u201cHe\u2019s going to want to be on his own,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cAnd he\u2019s definitely capable. But I can at least make sure he eats and doesn\u2019t use your house as a sex shop.\u201d</p><p>After a brief shudder, she said, \u201cAll right. But don\u2019t get any ideas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod forbid,\u201d he said.</p><p>Unlike her ex, Sarah was monogamous. She was just afraid of commitment, and for good reason, it seemed. There was no practical reason for her to trust a man, especially a man like Cooper, who could admit women had in the past complained that he just couldn\u2019t stick. There were no more proclamations of love, but the passion hadn\u2019t weakened.</p><p>While Sarah was in Florida, she called him daily. He spent his time at the renovation or his trailer. Rawley was still coming by most days and had taken to wearing a tool belt. Building was something he could do with minimal interaction. He did break down and ask Cooper if he might work on that old pickup in the shed, rather than taking it to his father\u2019s house where there was limited driveway and garage space. Ben had left an impressive collection of tools. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cMakes no difference to me, Rawley,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cJust leave me enough space in there for the toys. I\u2019ll put the Jet Ski on the water when the weather gets warm.\u201d</p><p>The bait shop was officially gone and the bar/deli was looking damn good. They\u2019d managed to kill the mold, reinforce the struts, lay down new floors, put up new drywall, rewire, plumb and polish without tearing down the deck. Cooper and Rawley got to work on the stairs to the dock, but the new roof and dock were going to wait till spring. One of Cooper\u2019s favorite things to do was walk through the renovated structure first thing every morning. Every day he was more impressed than the day before.</p> <p>One of the best parts of the day, if it was a nice day, was watching Landon come to the beach in his Razor. Sometimes Eve was with him. Ham was almost always sitting beside him\u2014and he wore a helmet. He looked so silly, sitting up tall with his small helmet latched under his chin. Then Landon would park in the center of the beach, let Ham get out, remove the helmet and run the beach after sticks and balls.</p><p>During that week that Cooper was spending nights at his house, Landon only gave him a wave. When Cooper wasn\u2019t the nanny, Landon might come up to the shop and look around at the progress.</p><p>When a new stove top, oven, warming trays and industrial-size ice maker were delivered and installed, it was virtually done. There was still enough finishing work to keep him busy, new tables and chairs to be delivered, bar stools to be ordered, but the contractors would be moving out and taking their Dumpster, trucks and equipment with them.</p><p>The two rooms above the bar were also finished, though vacant of furnishings. It was basically just a bedroom, sitting room and large bath with shower. He had installed a fireplace downstairs that extended to a second-floor fireplace in his sitting room. Drawers were built-in. If Cooper chose, he could move into the bar. If he wanted to, he could find storage space for the toy hauler and have something under his feet that didn\u2019t move in the wind.</p><p>Mac\u2019s involvement in any case against Jag Morrison had been limited to the battery charges, but it was the link to all other things. The first hurdle had been to convince Puck that he must press charges. In the end, Mac was able to convince him that Puck might be able to escape large sums of payment for his third son\u2019s education by stipulating that the boy had assaulted him.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the difference?\u201d Puck had asked. \u201cIt\u2019s not like there\u2019s any real money left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe difference is, the court could attach your future earnings to benefit the person who beat you up,\u201d Mac told him. \u201cAnd all you have to do to attempt to prevent that is file charges. Besides, eventually Jag needs to bear responsibility for his actions.\u201d</p><p>Puck, though in his seventies, had seen many fortunes come and go in his lifetime and fully expected to hit it big again any second. He was divorcing Effie while he had no visible means of support.</p><p>The next step for Mac was to charge Jag and send him to court. If the judge put him in jail for as little as forty-eight hours, that could be enough. The judge gave him a week in the county jail and two hundred hours of community service to add to the time he was already assigned for attacking Landon Dupre.</p><p>If there was one thing Mac knew about criminals, particularly young criminals, it was what idiots they could be. As Jag was taken into custody by an officer of the court, the homicide detective working on Ben\u2019s case told him, \u201cJust so you\u2019re aware, Mr. Morrison, we\u2019ll be interviewing your mother, father, brothers and friends about your relationship with the late Ben Bailey at the approximate time of his death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat for?\u201d he asked. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that guy at all.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust the same,\u201d the detective said. \u201cAnything you want to tell us before we start that process?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I look worried?\u201d he asked with his usual insolence.</p><p>That was all that was needed.</p><p>When Jag was booked, he was told the same thing as every prisoner\u2014that they have use of the phone in the jail, but that all calls will be recorded. When any prisoner picked up the phone and accessed an outside line, a recording restated that warning. And yet, Mac knew from experience, it was the rare inmate who believed anyone had time to listen to all those recorded calls.</p><p>They did.</p><p>Morrison called his mother, his father, his three friends who made up his little high school posse, and warned them all they\u2019d better not say anything about his involvement with Ben Bailey.</p><p>Those people were already on the list to be interviewed, but not right away. What was done immediately was a review of the phone tapes. And there was one conversation that was the most revealing.</p><p>Jag\u2019s buddy Kenny Sinclair said, \u201cYou said you offed him! You expect me to lie about that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no evidence!\u201d Jag said. \u201cWe burned the two-by-four I hit him with! And I was alone! There aren\u2019t any witnesses!\u201d</p><p>And there it was. It was admissible. He might have burned the forensic evidence, but his recorded statement was now in the hands of the D.A. They hoped to use that to sweat a confession out of him, as well.</p><p>It might not have been premeditated, it could have been manslaughter, but they knew who did it. And Jag Morrison knew he was a suspect. It might take months to bring it to trial, but they knew the truth.</p><p>This all caused Mac a great deal of reflection. He had brought his family to this little town to be safe and comfortable. And the scariest person in town turned out to be a seventeen-year-old kid.</p><p>Cooper was using a razor blade to scrape some of the paint off a pane of window glass, shining it up. He was on the deck, working on the outside, when the deputy\u2019s SUV came down the road from the highway. He dropped the razor into the open toolbox that sat on the table and wiped his hands on a rag.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you come across the beach?\u201d Cooper asked when Mac stepped onto the deck.</p><p>\u201cI had business in Coquille at the Sheriff\u2019s Department. Place is looking pretty good, Cooper,\u201d he said with a nod. \u201cBetter than it ever looked while Ben was here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook around the inside,\u201d Cooper said, opening the door. \u201cThere\u2019s some cleaning and deliveries left, but it\u2019s close to finished. Rawley and I are still working on the stairs to the dock, but we\u2019re close.\u201d</p><p>Mac whistled. \u201cI could live in this. That fireplace is just the touch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll sell it to you,\u201d Cooper said with a laugh. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to leave the kids and aunt behind, but the dogs can stay here with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe I could be a cop during the day and wait tables at night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, it bears thinking about. How long do you intend to be a cop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLong enough to make the pension worth my time. But seriously, Cooper, this place looks fantastic. I had no idea it was going to end up looking this good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid it all without totally gutting the interior. Mold is gone, plumbing doesn\u2019t talk to you all day and night, sits still in the wind, keeps out the rain. And done in around three months\u2019 time.\u201d He chuckled. \u201cAmazing what you can do with a ton of money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you get your investment back when you sell it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo telling,\u201d he said with a shrug. \u201cIt mattered to Ben. I couldn\u2019t just sell off the land. I wanted to do something to deserve what he left behind. I wanted to leave it better than I found it, something that would make him happy. That\u2019s about all there is to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, there might be one more thing. Jag Morrison was arrested this morning for the murder of Ben Bailey.\u201d</p><p>Cooper was shocked into silence, his mouth hanging open. It was a long moment before he whispered, \u201cOh, Jesus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how it\u2019s going to shake out. It\u2019s still under investigation. The prosecutor is alleging that Morrison\u2019s father, Puck, paid multiple visits to Ben, trying to entice him to sell his land. Puck wanted to develop it and there were plenty of investors on board for that idea. But Ben wasn\u2019t interested at any price. They believe Jag Morrison caused the fall that killed him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would he do that?\u201d Cooper asked in a breath.</p><p>\u201cMoney,\u201d Mac said. \u201cPuck\u2019s business was suffering with the recession and he had been asking the family to cut corners. According to Puck, he\u2019d told them the house was going into foreclosure. That house\u2014it was like the Morrison anchor, announcing them as the richest family in Thunder Point. That could all have been stopped if Ben considered even a small portion of his land for sale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was rooted here,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cIt meant more to him than just land. It was home. He wouldn\u2019t have wanted to start over, find a new home at forty.\u201d</p><p>Mac nodded. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t about to budge. But a lot of people around here thought he had no family, no next of kin, no one who would step in and take care of it. Then you came along.\u201d</p><p>Cooper ran a hand around the back of his neck. \u201cDid Jag\u2019s father have anything to do with Ben\u2019s death? Did he put Jag up to it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt it, but there\u2019s still an ongoing investigation.\u201d</p><p>A sardonic laugh shot out of Cooper. \u201cThe big house behind the gate was the evidence they were the richest family in town and the gentle giant in the crappy little bait shop was, in fact, the man with all the money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat about sums it up. I just wanted you to know. I can keep you posted, but I think until there\u2019s a court date, we\u2019re not going to have access to any more information. So\u2014you came here to find out what happened. It wasn\u2019t an accident, Cooper. That\u2019s what happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was a good man,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cWhy should good men die?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I could answer that, there\u2019d be no reason to have me in this job. Now, what about you? You were supposed to be here for a week. A little over three months later, you\u2019re still here. What\u2019s next for you?\u201d</p><p>That brought a melancholy smile to his lips. \u201cPretty soon I better work for a living.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Sarah?\u201d Mac asked.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s already working for a living,\u201d he said with a smile.</p><p>It was the following afternoon that Sarah came across the beach with Ham. Cooper chose not to tell her over the phone about the arrest. He hadn\u2019t been told to keep anything about the situation confidential, but he\u2019d be damned disappointed if they failed to convict the little motherfucker.</p><p>After he told her the news, she said, \u201cAre you making this up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not. He\u2019s been arrested. Investigation and hopefully a trial to follow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy God,\u201d she said. \u201cHe might\u2019ve killed Landon!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now he\u2019s arrested.\u201d He put his arms around her waist and pulled her near. \u201cWant a cup of coffee? I should rinse off the dirt and grime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just a little blown away by the news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo was I. I didn\u2019t want to tell you on the phone. Let me know how Landon takes it. I\u2019m not surprised by this, but it\u2019s still shocking. I knew he was bad but hell, Sarah, I underestimated him. Come on,\u201d he said, taking her hand and leading her\u2014and Ham\u2014to the trailer. He used the rag from his back pocket to wipe Ham\u2019s mouth and feet, then he fixed up his water in the saucepan. He tore the hoodie off over his head.</p><p>\u201cFeel like a shower?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d she said, smiling. \u201cLock the door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, these little interludes are very nice, Mrs. Robinson,\u201d he said with a grin. \u201cIt\u2019s naughty and sneaky and I like it.\u201d And he pulled his T-shirt over his head.</p><p>\u201cNo funny business,\u201d she said. \u201cI know you think this place is a mansion, but that shower is not really a two-person shower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d he said with a smirk, as he removed his boots and socks. \u201cAll funny business begins when you\u2019re dried off.\u201d And he dropped his jeans, revealing an erection. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>She laughed. \u201cCooper, you\u2019re not the least bit coy, are you. Can you hold that thought?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can. But let\u2019s not waste time.\u201d</p> <p>She went to the bedroom to remove her clothes, folding them in a pile on one of his built-in dressers, walking naked to the shower. When she got in, he was soapy and he pushed her up against the wall. He kissed her deeply, holding her against his soapy body. \u201cSarah, you are beautiful. Have I told you that lately?\u201d</p><p>She ran her hands over his chest. \u201cYou\u2019re beautiful, Cooper.\u201d She traced his tattoo on his right shoulder. It was a globe and ocean. Fitting. \u201cAre you clean enough yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I could manage to make you happy right now...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot right now, Cooper,\u201d she said, laughing. \u201cThis shower is worse than an airplane bathroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you ever done it in an airplane bathroom?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cNo. Have you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, no. But with you, I could.\u201d He lifted the showerhead from its bracket and rinsed them off. \u201cCome on.\u201d He turned off the water and pulled her out of the shower, but instead of drying off, he grabbed and carried her, slippery and squealing, to his bed.</p><p>\u201cCooper,\u201d she said and laughed. \u201cI\u2019m cold!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t be cold for long,\u201d he promised, covering her with kisses until she relented, put her arms around his neck and opened her legs for him. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about....\u201d</p><p>It took only a few moments for both of them to explode in the ultimate satisfaction, then melt into laughter once more.</p><p>\u201cDo you know what I love about being with you?\u201d she asked. \u201cYou\u2019re fun, you know when to be serious, then you\u2019re fun again.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you ever feel like there are eyes on you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Her eyes grew very large, then she turned her head to see Ham sitting patiently at the side of the bed near the foot, waiting for attention.</p><p>Cooper pulled on her chin, bringing her gaze back to him. \u201cPlease don\u2019t talk to him,\u201d he whispered. \u201cIf you do, I\u2019ll have a Great Dane on my back.\u201d</p><p>She started to laugh and he covered her mouth.</p><p>\u201cLaughing at him could do it, too. Shh. This is good, my hand over your mouth. I have to tell you something.\u201d He was smoothing the damp hair off her brow. \u201cRemember when I told you that I\u2019d been accused of being emotionally unavailable? Afraid of commitment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA couple of months ago,\u201d she said, and nodded.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t understand that at the time, but I think maybe the woman who said that was right.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m not that way with you. With you, I\u2019m mentally, emotionally, physically in the moment. All in. All there. All yours. I can tell. I feel different with you than I\u2019ve ever felt before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you saying this, Cooper?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause I want you to know. It\u2019s important that you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? You already told me you love me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove is easy,\u201d he said. \u201cThe other stuff is even more important.\u201d</p><p>She smiled and rubbed her knuckles along the hair over his ear. \u201cYou\u2019re awfully good to me when I\u2019m the one who\u2019s emotionally unavailable and afraid of commitment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not worried about that.\u201d He grinned at her. \u201cDo you want food?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou always make me hungry,\u201d she said, sitting up and wiggling to the other side of the bed so she wouldn\u2019t have to wrestle her way around Hamlet.</p><p>\u201cThis has been fun, these afternoons when Landon is at school and you\u2019re not at work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Rawley isn\u2019t here,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cRawley is here. He\u2019s working on that old car of Ben\u2019s in the shed. One of these days soon, I\u2019m going to have to actually work, too.\u201d He pulled on his jeans and gave Hamlet a pat on the head.</p><p>\u201cThe bar is done, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s as close to done as it needs to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you been sending out r\u00e9sum\u00e9s?\u201d she asked quietly.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cBut I\u2019ve gotten a couple of offers without applying. An old friend from Texas is giving up a news chopper job in San Francisco and he said they\u2019d hire me on his recommendation. ASAP. And Colorado really needs firefighters\u2014that was another personal recommendation. Last year\u2019s fires charred the state. They\u2019re ready to gear up for summer. Both positions are open immediately.\u201d</p><p>She looked down to fasten her pants.</p><p>\u201cWhat would you do, Sarah?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>She gave a shrug. \u201cNews chopper,\u201d she said. She looked up. \u201cCooper, do you think we\u2019ll stay in touch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so, Sarah. You could beg me not to leave,\u201d he suggested with a patient smile.</p><p>\u201cYou know I can\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you can\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow soon on that news job?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019d like someone right away. I assume that means within the week. But\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t leave without saying goodbye, would you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I wouldn\u2019t do that. Would you?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cWow. The idea of you leaving. It hit me. Even though I knew all along, since that first day I caught you surfing the net, looking at potential jobs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t like that? Me leaving?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d hate it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet you wouldn\u2019t ask me to stay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I can\u2019t. I explained about that. The best I could.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a little kiss on the forehead. \u201cYes, you did. Let me take you out to dinner at Cliff\u2019s. Text Landon and invite him. Tell him Eve can come. Take your horse home and I\u2019ll pick you up in an hour.\u201d</p><p>Sarah assumed one of Cooper\u2019s reasons for taking her out to dinner with Landon along was to explain to her brother that he\u2019d be leaving. But of course Landon brought Eve and the conversation around the table didn\u2019t leave room for any kind of serious discussion about Cooper\u2019s next move. Instead, it was all about Jag.</p><p>\u201cEveryone in school is talking. People say Jag shot him or stabbed him, but that can\u2019t be right,\u201d Eve said. \u201cThe police would\u2019ve known if that happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about his friends?\u201d Cooper wanted to know.</p><p>\u201cOnly Wormitz and Pickering were there. They said they didn\u2019t know anything, except that Morrison lied so much all the time, bragged so much, no one really took him seriously,\u201d Landon said. \u201cExcept Sinclair didn\u2019t come to school and someone said he isn\u2019t coming back. He\u2019s going to stay with his aunt and uncle in Seattle for a while. He might be afraid of Morrison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid either of them try saying they were sorry for backing him up? For picking on you?\u201d</p><p>Landon shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t see that happening, man. But around school, they\u2019re treated like they have typhoid fever.\u201d</p><p>When Cooper took Sarah home, he didn\u2019t go inside. Landon and Eve had followed them home in Landon\u2019s little truck, and they walked past them to go inside. Sarah told him she had to go to work early and probably wouldn\u2019t see him until late tomorrow, so he spent delicious moments at the front door, kissing her stupid.</p><p>Landon snapped open the front door. \u201cGet a room, guys,\u201d he said, then laughed at himself.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a pain in the ass sometimes,\u201d Cooper said.</p><p>\u201cWill you promise me something, Cooper? Will you please not leave town without explaining to Landon what\u2019s going on? Where you\u2019re going, what you\u2019re doing, all that? Because even though he\u2019s a pain in the ass, I think, in his way, he depends on you.\u201d</p><p>He rubbed a knuckle down her cheek.</p><p>\u201cSometimes you really act like you don\u2019t know me,\u201d he said, giving her a brief kiss. \u201cOr maybe you think I\u2019m someone else? Of course I would never leave without saying goodbye, without talking to Landon. Is this going to keep you awake all night? Because you have work early tomorrow and you need sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine,\u201d she lied. \u201cThank you for being so understanding. About Landon and everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk to you tomorrow,\u201d he said.</p><p>Why can\u2019t I say it, she asked herself. Why can\u2019t I say I love you, don\u2019t go? \u201cGood. Tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Sleep came hard. She heard Landon leave to take his girlfriend home, heard him return, saw the time on the clock every hour. The next day at the station dragged so much she found herself almost wishing they had a training day or an inspection.</p><p>She did talk to Cooper, but somehow managed not to ask him if he was packing. It hung like a pall over the conversation. The only thing that filled her mind right now was giving him up, an unfathomable notion. And yet she didn\u2019t want their relationship nailed down.</p><p>The sun was setting by the time she got home. Landon and the dog were gone, as was the Razor. She changed into spandex, rubber boots, turtleneck and her red slicker and headed across the beach. She suspected Landon and Cooper were having a talk about his leaving. But then she found Landon on the beach, throwing the ball for the dog, his ATV parked nearby, Ham\u2019s helmet in the seat.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Landon said.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she answered. \u201cDid you see Cooper? Talk to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d Landon said. \u201cI\u2019m wearing out this big old moose. Hey, I\u2019m going over to Eve\u2019s tonight. That\u2019s okay, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. They aren\u2019t getting sick of you over there, are they?\u201d</p><p>He grinned his heart-stopping grin. \u201cThey love me.\u201d</p><p>She looked up toward the bait shop. Cooper and Rawley were both there, working on something, though it was getting dark. \u201cI\u2019m going to go see Cooper. Are you having dinner at Eve\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably. Mac is starting to refer to me as his oldest son.\u201d He made a face. \u201cCreeps me out.\u201d</p><p>She laughed at him and that was all it took to remember they were a team. Invincible. Hard stuff had happened to them, but together they were up to it.</p><p>Well, today Cooper wasn\u2019t packing up. It appeared he was putting some sort of finishing touch on the bar. He and Rawley had ladders against the wall, one on each side of the double doors that opened onto the deck. It looked to be a sign, covered with a sheet or piece of paper. They lifted the sign just as she started up the stairs and while she climbed, they fastened it into place.</p><p>They were coming down as Sarah reached the deck. \u201cWhat are you guys doing?\u201d</p><p>Cooper looked at her over his shoulder, smiled at her and tore off the cover. The sign read BEN &amp; COOPER\u2019S.</p><p>Rawley lifted his ladder and took it around the corner, leaving them alone on the deck.</p><p>\u201cWhat is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA sign, Sarah,\u201d he said, laughing at her.</p><p>She took a step forward, looking up. \u201cYou\u2019re going to sell it with your name on the sign?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m not going to sell it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRent it?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cRun it. I hope I can figure it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Cooper, what about that flying job?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNah. I think I\u2019m done working for other people. I\u2019m too judgmental, for one thing. Now if I pick apart the way things are being run I have no one to blame but myself. Sarah, I\u2019m not done with us. We\u2019re just getting started.\u201d</p><p>She was shocked for a moment. Then she said, \u201cYou let me believe you were leaving!\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, then he put his hands on her waist. \u201cI didn\u2019t correct your assumption. It\u2019s true, I was contacted about a couple of flying jobs. I turned them both down. Even though dropping flame retardant on a big nasty fire does sound like fun.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body>  <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say so? Why didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you I loved you. I told you I was all in, that you could trust me. Do you think I\u2019m the kind of guy who can say something like that and then leave you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes!\u201d she said. \u201cI thought that! Not because you\u2019re a bad guy, but because you said you had to work.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt in my mind, I\u2019m going to have to work. I bet this place only looks simple. I bet it turns into a giant pain in the ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Cooper, what are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m staying, Sarah. I\u2019m not going to push you, crowd you or worry you. I\u2019m just going to love you. I\u2019m going to hang around here, close to you, until you trust me enough to get your dreams back.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him for a moment. Then she put her hands on his cheeks and pulled his mouth onto hers, kissing him so deep and so hard it knocked him back a step. But he hung on to her. Then, against his lips, she whispered, \u201cI do love you, Cooper. I do.\u201d</p> <p>He smiled against her lips. \u201cI know, baby. I know.\u201d </p>  </body></html>"]
