Letting my leg dangle off the edge of the lounger, I push my toes into the soft white sand. Jake is beside me on his own lounger, his hand in mine, fingers laced together, as he talks on the phone to Stuart.</p><p>\u201cJust tell them to do the job I pay them to do. If they have a problem with that, then remind them they are not irreplaceable...I know. Fuckin\u2019 idiots...oh, you know that thing I asked you to do for me...you did? Good, thanks.\u201d</p><p>With a sigh, Jake ends his call and tosses his iPhone onto the side table.</p> <p>\u201cAll okay?\u201d I ask, turning my head to look at him.</p><p>God, he is beautiful. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever get used to how breath-stealing Jake truly is.</p><p>He looks even more stunning here, with his skin sun-kissed, causing the freckles on his nose to show more prominently. He looks yummy delicious.</p><p>\u201cHmm? Yeah, everything\u2019s fine,\u201d he answers, sounding a little distracted. \u201cJust people not doing what I pay them to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to talk about it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d He lifts my hand to his mouth and brushes his lips across my knuckles, placing a specific kiss on my ring. \u201cThere are a lot of things I want to do with you while we are here, Tru, and talking about work is not one of them.\u201d</p><p>Ignoring his desire to not talk about work, I say, \u201cDo you need to get back to LA early to sort the problem out?\u201d</p><p>Jake shifts onto his side to face me. \u201cNo. You and I are spending time together here, alone. Nothing and no one will get me off this island and away from you. I plan on spending the next five days keeping you in the minimal amount of clothes possible, if not none at all, and spending most of that time fucking you senseless.\u201d</p><p>A shiver runs down my spine.</p><p>I love it when he talks to me like this. Dirty and domineering. It\u2019s incredibly hot.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a romantic.\u201d I roll my eyes playfully.</p> <p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have me any other way.\u201d</p><p>I let my gaze drift to serious. \u201cNo, I wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I reach over and grab my bottle of water off the table and take a drink, letting my eyes drift over the beautiful scenery before me.</p><p>We\u2019re on a private island in Fiji. More specifically, we\u2019re staying on Turtle Island, one of the Yasawa Islands in Fiji. It\u2019s where The Blue Lagoon was filmed. It\u2019s private and exclusive and has only fourteen villas on the whole island, but Jake being Jake, he has rented out the whole island for a week. A week of total isolation for him and me. Dave and Ben, Jake\u2019s bodyguards, are with us, of course, staying separately in one of the other villas at the far side of the island. I\u2019ve barely seen them since I arrived here. And aside from the staff who live on the island, it\u2019s just Jake and me.</p><p>That\u2019s how it\u2019s been for the last two days, and it is heaven. Absolute heaven.</p><p>After the show at Madison Square Garden, when Jake did his stage dash to come after me and ask me to marry him, things got a little crazy...well, crazier, as life with Jake is always crazy.</p><p>Basically, I wasn\u2019t thinking straight after everything that had happened that night, and I wasn\u2019t as smart as I should have been. I didn\u2019t hide my ring. As Jake and I entered the hotel after leaving the show, a member of the waiting press spotted it, and all hell broke loose.</p><p>For the next two days we were literally confined to the hotel. Press and fans gathered and hollered outside. It was suffocating. When Jake suggested we get away and leave the country for a while, I was fully on board.</p> <p>I left all the travel arrangements to Jake. I didn\u2019t care where we went, just as long as we were alone.</p><p>And alone we are.</p><p>I love being here with him. It\u2019s the first time since we got together that it\u2019s been just him and me.</p><p>I know I just offered to go back to LA, but in all honesty it was a halfhearted offer. I don\u2019t want to let this go\u2014what we have here right now\u2014the complete solitude to do what we want, when we want.</p><p>But I know there\u2019s something bothering him workwise. The tone of his voice when he was talking to Stuart was clear enough to tell me that. Even now, I can tell his mind is elsewhere as he stares out at the ocean, his fingers tapping restlessly against my hand.</p><p>I hate that he won\u2019t share with me what it is. I know it\u2019s because he doesn\u2019t want to burden me, but I want him to burden me. I want him to share everything with me. Our lives are entwined now, and I don\u2019t want him carrying things alone anymore. The last time he did that, he fell off the wagon, and we lost each other as a result of it.</p><p>Jake is still only a few weeks\u2019 clean, and I, for one, want to keep him that way.</p><p>I\u2019m glad he\u2019s here, away from all temptation at the moment. Well, all temptations except me, that is. I do worry, though, how things will be for him when we eventually go back to the real world.</p><p>\u201cYou fancy a swim before the sun goes in?\u201d I nod in the direction of the water lapping the white sand, deciding not to push the subject further. I\u2019ll tackle his communication issues later, when he\u2019s more relaxed.</p><p>Jake\u2019s eyes set on my body, his gaze roaming every curve, causing all the muscles in me to involuntarily clench. Especially the ones between my legs.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re asking if I want a chance to see you wet, wearing that bikini?\u201d A grin curves his gorgeous mouth as he lifts his brow in question.</p><p>I glance down at my favourite and most recent bikini purchase. It\u2019s white with pink flowers and has tiny diamantes sewn in. I picked it up from the airport. It was love at first sight.</p><p>\u201cHow do you manage to turn something as simple as my request to swim, into sex?\u201d I ask, chuckling, as I climb up from my lounger.</p><p>I pull my sunglasses off my head and drop them onto my towel. Hands on hips, I stare down at him.</p><p>Jake\u2019s eyes skim my curves again. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in the equation, sweetheart, everything is about sex.\u201d</p><p>He slides off his lounger, rising to his feet in one graceful move, and comes over to me.</p><p>My whole body suddenly aches for his touch. I feel hungry for him.</p><p>I simply cannot get enough of Jake. And I don\u2019t want to. Ever.</p><p>Jake presses himself against me. My hands instantly go to his hard stomach, fingers pressed against his rigid muscle, as I stare up into his beautiful blue eyes. Eyes I could spend a lifetime staring into.</p><p>A devilish smile curves his lips as two large hands reach down and cup my behind, urging me to lift and wrap my legs around his waist.</p><p>Of course, I happily oblige his unspoken request.</p><p>Snaking my arms around his neck, I wind my fingers into his lush black hair and kiss his lips, feeling his instant erection press against me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re hard?\u201d I smile.</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re hot,\u201d he says with a shrug.</p><p>Jake puts his lips against my neck, sliding the tip of his tongue over my skin as he starts the short walk down to the water.</p><p>He wades us into the sun-warmed ocean until we\u2019re chest deep.</p><p>The long length of my hair is already wet, so holding on to Jake\u2019s shoulders, I tilt my head back, wetting the rest.</p><p>As I right myself, I meet Jake\u2019s stare again. \u201cHow did I get so lucky to have you?\u201d he asks. His eyes suddenly look unsure.</p><p>Whatever anxiety is in his mind right now, I want to ease it, reassure him.</p><p>\u201cI ask myself the same question every day about you,\u201d I murmur. I need Jake to realise I am no better than he is. He has his faults, but so do I.</p><p>Jake exhales, closing his eyes briefly, then leans in and kisses me. His kiss takes my regret with it.</p><p>Losing myself in him, I part my lips, letting his tongue into my mouth. His tongue caresses mine with slow, deliberate movements.</p><p>Knowing where this kiss is heading, I whisper, \u201cYou want to go back to the villa?\u201d I\u2019m so ready to get naked with him.</p><p>\u201cNo. I want you right here, right now.\u201d The command in his voice equals the command in his hands as they grip my ass tighter, pulling me hard onto his erection.</p><p>\u201cYou into exhibition sex nowadays, Wethers?\u201d</p><p>He lets out a deep, throaty laugh. \u201cNo, I\u2019m just into you. All. The. Fucking. Time.\u201d His words come out staccato with each kiss he places upon my shoulder.</p><p>I feel his teeth graze over my skin. My nipples tighten in response, leaving my breasts feeling very heavy in my bikini top.</p><p>I cast a quick glance around. \u201cWhat if someone sees us?\u201d</p><p>Jake glances around, eyes glittering. \u201cWe\u2019re in the middle of nowhere. In the ocean, no less. Who the fuck is going to see us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe people who work here. Or Dave. Or Ben.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen they\u2019ll get a good show.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJake!\u201d I slap his shoulder with my hand.</p><p>Bringing his face before mine, he rests the tip of his nose against mine. \u201cThey know to stay away. It\u2019s just me and you out here, baby.\u201d</p><p>Feeling uninhibited, as I can only with him, I murmur, \u201cIf that\u2019s the case...\u201d I press my lips to his neck, kissing him. I run my tongue over his skin, to the sensitive part just below his ear that I know drives him crazy.</p><p>Jake shudders and tightens his hold on me, grinding his hips into mine.</p><p>Moving my hand down, I submerge it into the water and reach into Jake\u2019s swim shorts.</p><p>I\u2019m instantly met with the silky, rock-hard feel of him. I slide my fingers down the shaft, stroking just as I know he likes.</p><p>Jake\u2019s mouth searches for mine, groaning; he kisses me like he\u2019s starved for me.</p><p>I love how Jake\u2019s hunger for me is never sated. We\u2019ve made love countless times since we arrived on the island, him devouring and depleting me every time, but each time is still as intense as the first.</p><p>Jake runs his hand over my breast, cupping it. Tugging my bikini top down, freeing my breast, he traces his thumb over the tip of my already erect nipple. His other hand is busy working its way into my bikini bottoms from behind.</p><p>His fingers find my entrance, and he slips one inside me.</p><p>I let out a moan of pleasure into his mouth.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d he groans. \u201cI can\u2019t wait. I need to be inside you. Now.\u201d</p><p>I love it when he gets demanding and greedy for me.</p><p>Loosening my legs from around him, I shimmy his swim shorts down over his hips, then I move my bikini bottoms to the side.</p><p>Jake positions the head of his cock at my entrance, and very slowly, he eases a little of himself into me. Jake usually prepares me for his size with his fingers and tongue, relaxing me, readying me for him, but I\u2019m so turned on right now, doing it out here, I don\u2019t care if it does hurt.</p><p>I need him inside me. Apparently, more than I have the need for self-preservation.</p><p>So does Jake, as his hands go back to my ass, grabbing me firmly, pulling me onto the full length of him.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d I hiss, between my teeth, as he opens me wide, to painful pleasure.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d he searches my eyes.</p><p>\u201cYeah...\u201d I shift my hips around him \u201cYeah, I\u2019m good...great,\u201d I breathe as I hit onto the amazing feeling of him inside me.</p><p>\u201cSorry, I was being selfish...but...fuck, Tru,\u201d he groans softly. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever get over how incredible you feel around me. You\u2019re so fuckin\u2019 tight. So fuckin\u2019 hot.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAhh,\u201d I moan as Jake tilts his hips, hitting that sweet spot inside of me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna come for me,\u201d he breathes over my skin. \u201cRight here in the Pacific Ocean. You\u2019re gonna scream my name as I bring you to orgasm.\u201d He licks my lower lip, then plunges his tongue deep into my mouth with each hard thrust into me.</p><p>His movements increase in tempo, and I hold on tight to him, fingernails digging into his skin, the wash of the salty water slick between us.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll never get enough of you, Tru. Never,\u201d he growls into my ear, hitting me with hard, sure thrusts, penetrating me deep inside.</p> <p>And he makes sure he doesn\u2019t as he continues to make love to me in the swell of the Pacific Ocean, while the sun descends, making its effortless journey behind the water.</p><p>Dusk has settled, and Jake and I lie together in the four-poster bed of our villa.</p><p>It\u2019s a tasteful, modest villa. Not flashy. It\u2019s us.</p><p>The whole place is open, each room flowing into the other. It has a free feeling about it. The type of freedom Jake isn\u2019t usually granted.</p><p>I wonder if that\u2019s one of the reasons he chose this place for us.</p> <p>The bedroom is light and airy, the bedsheets a clean, crisp white. Even though it\u2019s a haven many celebrities choose for a getaway, it\u2019s not overdone. It\u2019s understated.</p><p>It\u2019s perfect.</p><p>The sheets are kicked back because of the insane evening heat. Our legs are tangled together, our bodies touching, sticky from the sea salt and sand coating our skin. I\u2019m draped across Jake\u2019s chest as he absentmindedly plays with my tangled hair, quietly humming a song.</p><p>I listen intently as he starts to softly sing the words.</p><p>He sounds beautiful. I love listening to Jake sing. Especially a cappella.</p><p>\u201cWhat song are you singing?\u201d I ask, lifting my head.</p> <p>\u201cOur song.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know we had one.\u201d I smile. Jake and I have lots of songs that remind us of our childhood, but none that are just him and me, that symbolise us as a couple.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s called \u2018You Started,\u2019 by Ou Est Le Swimming Pool.\u201d At my puzzled expression, he says, \u201cYou never heard it before?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head.</p><p>\u201cAnd you call yourself a musical journalist.\u201d He clicks his tongue in mock reproof. \u201cThey were a band from the UK as well. Poor showing on your part, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d I stick my tongue out at him.</p><p>He catches it lightning quick between his thumb and forefinger, giving it a gentle tug before letting go.</p><p>\u201cSo why is it our song?\u201d I rest my chin on his chest.</p> <p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s us,\u201d he replies simply.</p><p>\u201cOkay...,\u201d I say, needing more. \u201cAnd just when did you decide it was our song?\u201d</p><p>I see a flash of pain cross his face. I don\u2019t like the way it makes me feel.</p><p>\u201cThe first time I heard it was the day after you left me in Boston.\u201d With his words comes a fierce pain in my chest as I remember our time apart. \u201cI was in the car with Denny. He\u2019d forced me out of my hotel room to get some food, and he had the album playing in his car. When I heard the song, it was just like listening to the story of us, Tru.\u201d He focuses his gaze in on me, staring deep into my eyes like no one else can. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t already know at that point that I had to win you back, then that song made me realise even more that I...\u201d He pauses, blowing out a breath.</p><p>\u201cRealise what?\u201d I urge.</p><p>\u201cThat I had to fight for you. That I had to do whatever it took to get you back. Even if it meant playing dirty.\u201d He runs his rough fingertips down my cheek. \u201cThere is no one else for me. I begin and end with you.\u201d</p><p>Reaching for my hand, he lifts it to his and places them palm to palm.</p><p>\u201cCan I hear it?\u201d I ask, feeling choked up. \u201cDo you have it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s on my phone. It\u2019s your ringtone, in fact,\u201d he adds, reaching for it.</p><p>\u201cHow do I not know that?\u201d I narrow my eyes at him.</p><p>\u201cBecause when you ring me, you\u2019re usually elsewhere.\u201d He gives me a dumb face.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such an idiot,\u201d I say with a laugh, shoving him in the chest.</p><p>Chuckling, Jake presses a button on the screen of his phone and sets it down on his chest between us. A few seconds later, I hear light synth piano keys start to play.</p><p>The sound fills our villa. The only other sounds are the washing waves outside and the thudding of my aching heart.</p><p>The singer begins, and goose bumps shiver down my arms as I listen intently to every word. Hanging on them. Then it hits the chorus, and I can\u2019t stop the tears that fill my eyes.</p><p>I know exactly what Jake is saying. It is us. Him. Me. Everything. The good, and the bad.</p><p>The second chorus breaks, and violins strum in the background, setting the tears to spill over and run down my cheeks.</p><p>\u201cHey, don\u2019t cry,\u201d Jake says, soothing me, brushing away my tears with his fingers.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I can\u2019t help it. It\u2019s stunning. And it\u2019s us, completely. You\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did...start my life,\u201d Jake says, referring to the song title, pushing his fingers into my hair, cupping my cheek.</p><p>\u201cAnd you mine,\u201d I utter, climbing on top of him. I crush my lips to his.</p><p>His hand goes to the back of my neck, holding me to him as his tongue gently strokes over mine. He sucks my bottom lip into his mouth, exhaling a gentle breath over me. \u201cYou don\u2019t complete me, Tru. You make me who I am. You make me better. I\u2019d be nothing without you. Nothing. I\u2019ve been there once before, and I\u2019m never going back. I\u2019m never losing you again.\u201d</p><p>I get chills at his words. \u201cGood, because I\u2019m going nowhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo regrets?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cNever. I\u2019m right where I\u2019m meant to be\u2014where I was always meant to be.\u201d</p><p>Reaching between us, he moves his phone away, placing it on the bed, as the song comes to a close.</p><p>I lie against his chest, closing my eyes. I breathe in the essence of him as he wraps his arms tightly around me.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got dinner plans,\u201d he says after a moment, picking up his phone and checking the time.</p><p>\u201cWe do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep, and we should get moving if we\u2019re going to make them.\u201d</p><p>Jake rolls me off his chest and gets up.</p><p>\u201cThe staff will wait, Jake. It\u2019s not like they\u2019re booked up or anything. Come back to bed.\u201d I pat the empty space beside me.</p><p>I really can\u2019t be bothered to get up. I\u2019m happy to stay here, wrapped up in him.</p><p>He stretches his arms over his head, giving me a full, unadulterated view of his luscious body, then leans down and places a chaste kiss on my lips.</p><p>\u201cJust humour me for once,\u201d he says, then retreats to the bathroom, leaving me behind to ponder.</p><p>Humour him? What the hell is he talking about?</p><p>I hear the shower turn on.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got half an hour to get ready, so get that sweet ass of yours moving,\u201d Jake calls from the bathroom.</p><p>He\u2019s so bossy.</p><p>With a huff, I swing my legs over the edge of the bed and head into the bathroom to join him in the huge twin shower.</p><p>\u201cYou look beautiful,\u201d Jake says, coming up behind me, wrapping his arms around my waist.</p><p>I\u2019m in front of the large bathroom mirror, putting the finishing touches on my outfit. I fasten my locket\u2014the one Jake bought me in Paris\u2014around my neck and smile back at his reflection.</p><p>\u201cSo do you. I love how your freckles stand out when you\u2019ve been in the sun.\u201d</p><p>He scrunches his face. \u201cThey make me look like I\u2019m fourteen.\u201d</p><p>I turn in his arms and run my fingertip down his nose. \u201cNo, they make you look hot. Hotter than usual.\u201d I reach up on my tiptoes and kiss the tip of his nose.</p><p>I\u2019m struggling on Turtle Island without my heels\u2014I miss my heels a lot. I\u2019m either barefoot or in flip-flops, which I\u2019ll be donning tonight with my white strappy shift dress.</p><p>I step back, leaning against the sink, appraising my man, who is wearing cutoff jean shorts and a sleeveless Pearl Jam tee, looking the epitome of a rock star, with his tattoos exposed. You can take the rock star out of LA but never the rock star out of Jake.</p><p>\u201cYou ready?\u201d he asks, fingering my locket against my chest.</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>Jake takes hold of my hand, linking our fingers, and leads me out of the bathroom, through the villa, and outside into the moonlit night.</p><p>It\u2019s amazing here. I can see every single star in the sky. No smog shielding them from view\u2014just clear skies for as far as the eye can see.</p><p>We walk to the beach, taking the short path to the main house, where the restaurant is. When we reach the turnoff, I start to head that way, but Jake tugs on my hand, pulling me back. He shakes his head.</p><p>I tilt my head, intrigued, but I let him lead me onward, no questions asked.</p><p>As we round the curve of the island, I catch sight of a table on the beach a short distance from the shoreline, set up and ready for us.</p><p>\u201cDinner on the beach?\u201d I beam at him.</p><p>\u201cOnly the best for my girl,\u201d he says, then kisses my forehead.</p><p>There are hanging lanterns, attached to sticks driven into the sand, surrounding the table. But it\u2019s not the lanterns that catch my eye\u2014it\u2019s the lights just beyond the table.</p><p>Dropping Jake\u2019s hand, I walk to the candles in the sand.</p><p>Marry Me</p><p>It\u2019s spelled out by tea-light candles that have been worked into the sand, centred in a heart.</p><p>With my heart in my mouth, and my head a little dizzy, I turn to him. \u201cYou\u2019re asking me to marry you?\u201d</p><p>Staring steadily at me, he says, \u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you already do that?\u201d I offer a confused smile, holding up my left hand, displaying my very beautiful engagement ring.</p><p>Jake walks over to me. I don\u2019t know why, but my heart starts to beat faster. My insides tremble, almost as if this is the first time he\u2019s asking.</p><p>Reaching for me, he takes hold of both my hands. \u201cTru, I asked you to marry me backstage at Madison Square Garden in the midst of a show. Hardly a romantic setting and not how I ever envisioned it actually happening.\u201d He takes a fortifying breath. \u201cSo this is me asking you the right way, the way I always wanted to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJake, I didn\u2019t care how or where you asked me...only that you did ask.\u201d</p><p>He rubs his thumb over my engagement ring. \u201cI want you to have the best of everything I can give you. And I\u2019m not talking money here, Tru. I\u2019m talking memories. Our life together. I asked you to marry me straight after we had both just dragged each other through an emotional wringer. Now things have calmed and we\u2019re good\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d I add.</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d He smiles. \u201cI\u2019m asking you again so your mind is clear on the fact that asking you was no knee-jerk reaction on my part. You, forever, is everything I want. And I guess, well...\u201d He looks down, shifting uncomfortably, before meeting my eyes. \u201cI guess I want to know for me too. I want to know that marrying me is exactly what you want. That you didn\u2019t just say yes because you felt pressured into doing so.\u201d His hands tighten around mine to almost the point of pain. \u201cI wasn\u2019t exactly taking no for an answer that night, was I?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo, I guess you weren\u2019t.\u201d I smile, shaking my head, remembering Jake\u2019s words that night. \u201cBut I\u2019m not exactly a pushover either. I wouldn\u2019t have said yes if it wasn\u2019t exactly what I wanted. I love you. I\u2019ve always loved you,\u201d I add, surprised by the tears that fill my eyes.</p><p>\u201cI love you too, baby.\u201d He takes my face in his hands and kisses me gently on the lips.</p><p>\u201cSo is that a yes?\u201d he asks against my mouth.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a yes.\u201d I grin, happiness bubbling up in me. \u201cNow we have two marriage proposals to tell the kids about one day.\u201d</p> <p>I feel him stiffen up against me. And not in a good way.</p><p>Tilting my head back, I catch something in his eyes that sets unease rolling around my stomach.</p><p>Not good. Not good at all.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean we\u2019ll have kids now, of course,\u201d I hasten to add. \u201cNot for ages. Like, a really, really long time.\u201d Three, four years max.</p><p>Jake remains quiet, continuing to stare at me, his face an unreadable mask. But even in this low light, I can tell the colour has drained a little from his face.</p> <p>And now I feel inclined to ask the question, \u201cYou do want kids, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>I do. I couldn\u2019t envision a life not having them.</p><p>He clears his throat. \u201cI...um...well, I don\u2019t know.\u201d He shrugs. It\u2019s an awkward, jerky kind of shrug. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s just not something I ever considered. I guess I just never saw kids as part of my future. They\u2019re not an investment I ever considered making.\u201d</p><p>An investment? Since when did kids become a commodity?</p><p>This really is not good. It\u2019s so far from good, it\u2019s replaced whatever the word for that would be.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I say.</p> <p>What else can I say? A sudden chill settles over my skin, and it\u2019s got nothing to do with the night air. I take a small step back from him.</p><p>\u201cLook, Tru.\u201d He lifts his eyes to mine. \u201cYou know I didn\u2019t have the best role model growing up.\u201d</p><p>Jake\u2019s dad was an abusive, poor excuse for a man, who went to prison for his treatment of Jake and his mom.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t know the first thing about being a dad,\u201d he continues. \u201cAnd babies...Christ, they don\u2019t exactly fit into my world, do they? I mean, I wouldn\u2019t have a clue where to start. Music is my thing. You, and music.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the look on my face or my body language or the complete bloody idiot inside of him possessing him to the point of maximum stupidity that prompts him to say, \u201cBut, hey, if kids are what you want, then sure, we\u2019ll have kids.\u201d He kisses my forehead. \u201cWhatever you want, sweetheart. It\u2019s no biggie. Come on, let\u2019s eat.\u201d</p><p>Stunned to silence, I let Jake lead me to the table, never actually saying the words I want to say. The ones that are stuck in my throat, choking me to death.</p><p>It\u2019s no biggie, he said. No biggie.</p><p>He\u2019s right, it\u2019s not big. It\u2019s huge. Fucking ginormous, in fact.</p> <p>And right now my heart has dropped straight through that fucking ginormous fact and is hurtling somewhere toward oblivion.</p><p>You don\u2019t have a child with someone because it\u2019s what the other person wants, because it will keep them happy. Especially when that something\u2014as big as having children\u2014is something you clearly do not want. You have a child with someone because it\u2019s what you both want, together.</p><p>It\u2019s most definitely what I want in the future. Apparently, Jake...not so much.</p><p>How did I not know this?</p><p>A hollow feeling takes up residence in my chest.</p><p>Jake doesn\u2019t want kids. And I do.</p><p>This puts us on very different pages.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>How did I go from a second marriage proposal and blissful happiness to a possibly empty future in the space of a few minutes?</p><p>Screw me and my goddamn big mouth.</p><p>CHAPTER TWO</p><p>I wake in the dark to the feeling of my stomach roiling.</p><p>I\u2019m going to be sick.</p><p>Clamping my hand over my mouth, I scramble out of bed and run for the bathroom.</p><p>I make it just in time. Tossing up the toilet lid, I throw up.</p><p>The next thing I know, Jake is beside me, gathering my hair back from my face as his other hand gently soothes my back.</p><p>When my stomach is empty, Jake reaches over and flushes the toilet while I rest my head on my forearm, sweat trickling from my face and down my neck.</p><p>Jake reaches over and gets a tie for my hair off the sink and puts my hair into a loose ponytail for me.</p><p>I hear running water and then feel a cool flannel against the back of my neck.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI woke up feeling like I was going to throw up. And then I did, obviously...\u201d I trail off.</p><p>Jake puts his hand to my forehead. \u201cYou feel really hot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything here feels hot,\u201d I mumble.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get you back to bed.\u201d Jake scoops me into his arms and carries me to the bedroom.</p><p>He lays me down on the bed. My sweaty skin instantly sticks to the sheets.</p><p>I feel so uncomfortable and very sick.</p><p>I hear Jake moving around the bedroom, and then he sits beside me, holding out a glass of water. \u201cTry some water. Just sip it.\u201d</p><p>Propping myself up on my elbow, I accept the glass from Jake and take slow sips.</p><p>I\u2019ve only just put the glass down on the bedside cabinet when the wave of nausea hits again.</p><p>\u201cSick again,\u201d I gasp, putting my hand over my mouth.</p><p>I\u2019m back in Jake\u2019s arms in an instant, and he strides to the bathroom, placing me beside the toilet, kneeling beside me, once again rubbing my back as I retch up the water I just drank.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m calling for a doctor,\u201d Jake says, once I\u2019ve heaved myself dry.</p><p>He disappears for a moment to get his phone, then he\u2019s back beside me. I curl up in his lap on the bathroom floor, listening to him barking orders down the phone as he gently strokes wisps of hair from off my damp face. And I begin to feel worse and worse with each passing moment.</p><p>\u201cUgh,\u201d I groan, blinking my blurry eyes against the daylight.</p><p>Rolling over, I find Jake beside me wearing his boxer shorts, propped against the headboard, his laptop on his knee.</p><p>Glancing at the screen, I see a spreadsheet filled with numbers.</p><p>Minimising the spreadsheet from my view, he sets his laptop on the bed and scoots down to face me.</p><p>\u201cHow you feeling?\u201d he asks. Lifting a hand to my face, he runs his fingers gently over my cheek, brushing my stray hair back.</p><p>\u201cLike I spent the whole night throwing up. What time is it?\u201d I croak, rubbing my sore eyes.</p><p>\u201cOne p.m.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist, I slept the whole morning away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou needed it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I guess. I\u2019m so thirsty,\u201d I say, turning my head, looking for the glass of water I\u2019d left on the bedside cabinet.</p><p>\u201cI got rid of it,\u201d Jake says. \u201cIt was warm. I\u2019ll get you something fresh.\u201d Before leaving the bed, he kisses my forehead, then gets up and heads for the minifridge.</p><p>He opens a bottle of water. Helping me to sit, he hands the bottle to me.</p><p>I still feel so weak. My limbs are like jelly. I lean back against the headboard and gratefully gulp the water.</p><p>\u201cThe doctor left you some medication to take once you\u2019d stopped throwing up. You still feel sick?\u201d</p><p>Still drinking from the bottle, I shake my head.</p><p>Jake grabs a pill bottle from my bedside cabinet, opens it up, shakes two tablets out, and hands them to me.</p><p>I pop the pills in my mouth and quickly wash them down with water.</p><p>I gag at the harsh taste the pills leave on my tongue. \u201cI hate taking pills.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoor baby,\u201d he soothes.</p><p>\u201cRemind me never to eat prawns again.\u201d Ugh, just the thought of them turns my stomach.</p><p>When the doctor arrived by seaplane a few hours after I\u2019d started throwing up\u2014dragged from his bed due to Jake\u2019s incessant demands that I be seen by a doctor straightaway\u2014he checked me over and concluded I had a mild case of food poisoning.</p><p>We figured it was the prawns. Jake doesn\u2019t like them, and they were the only thing he hadn\u2019t eaten.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to have the chef fired?\u201d he asks.</p><p>If I thought he was joking, I\u2019d say yes, but knowing Jake as I do, I know he would have the poor guy fired. I don\u2019t want that to happen. It\u2019s not his fault I ate a dodgy prawn.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I smile, and reaching my hand to his face, I rest it against his cheek.</p><p>Closing his eyes briefly, he presses a kiss to my wrist. \u201cDo you want to try and get some more rest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, what I really want to do is get clean and brush my teeth. I feel skanky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSkanky?\u201d He grins, glancing at me through his dark lashes. \u201cDo you just make these words up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I stick my tongue out at him. \u201cYou\u2019ve just forgotten how to be British.\u201d</p><p>With a chuckle, he rises from the bed. \u201cI\u2019ll get the shower ready for you.\u201d</p><p>Jake disappears into the bathroom, leaving me sipping my water.</p><p>I rest my head against the headboard and close my eyes to the sound of the water turning on in the bathroom.</p><p>Jake doesn\u2019t want children.</p><p>It\u2019s like a whisper in my mind, coming from out of nowhere.</p><p>My stomach clenches. I can\u2019t think about that now. I\u2019ll think about it later.</p><p>One thing it does remind me to do is take my contraceptive pill. A pregnancy is not something I want happening right now. Or ever, as the case may be.</p><p>Reaching down, I grab my bag off the floor and get my pill out.</p><p>I\u2019m just swallowing it when Jake reappears from the bathroom. Moving across the hardwood floor, he comes over and takes the water bottle from my hand, putting it down.</p><p>\u201cYou ready for your shower?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d I slide my jelly legs to the side of the bed to stand, but before I get a chance, Jake picks me up, lifting me into his arms.</p><p>\u201cI could have walked,\u201d I say, resting my head against his chest.</p><p>\u201cNo point testing out the theory while I\u2019m here to take care of you.\u201d</p><p>Jake steps into the huge double-headed shower and sits me down on the wide ledge at the far side.</p><p>The steam from the water soothes me instantly.</p><p>Jake hands me my toothbrush; it\u2019s ready with toothpaste on it. Smiling at his preparation, I start to brush my teeth while he kneels before me and sets about removing my shorts and panties.</p><p>When I\u2019ve finished brushing my teeth, I spit into the running water, rinsing my brush under the shower, and set it on the ledge beside me.</p><p>Standing, Jake leans down and takes hold of the hem of my vest and eases it up. I lift my heavy arms, allowing him to pull it over my head. He tosses it to the floor outside the shower, along with the rest of my clothes.</p><p>I see his eyes sweep over my naked body. And I don\u2019t miss the erection he\u2019s sporting when he removes his own shorts. Well, the size of it would be hard to miss.</p><p>I love that even sick, I can still turn him on.</p><p>\u201cEven sick and skanky, I can still turn you on.\u201d I smile up at him.</p><p>\u201cEven sick and skanky,\u201d he murmurs, cupping my face. Leaning down, he presses a soft kiss to my lips.</p><p>Jake reaches for the sponge and shower gel and gently begins washing my skin. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The feel of his hands on me is insanely arousing. I really wish I weren\u2019t sick right now.</p><p>\u201cThis would have been so much easier if this villa had a bath,\u201d I muse, thinking how nice it would have been to sit in a tub together. \u201cBut you do make a great nurse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is just an excuse so I can touch you,\u201d he says, his voice sounding hoarse.</p><p>\u201cYou can touch me whenever you want,\u201d I reply, voice serious.</p> <p>\u201cMine,\u201d he murmurs, sweeping a soapy hand between my legs, cupping my sex.</p><p>My body instantly reacts. Desire pools between my legs. My mouth waters at the thought of tasting him. Even sick, I crave him.</p><p>After Jake is done cleaning every part of me, kneeling in front of me, he says, \u201cI need to rinse you off and wash your hair, sweetheart, but these damn shower heads are fixed to the wall. Here, wrap your legs around my waist and put your arms around my neck and hold on tight.\u201d</p><p>Not wanting to argue, knowing I probably could manage to stand\u2014but honestly just enjoying the attention he\u2019s lavishing on me\u2014I do as he says.</p><p>Jake stands with me wrapped around him like a koala bear and puts us both under the running water.</p> <p>I feel so safe and loved here in his arms.</p><p>He reaches for the shampoo bottle and begins washing my hair. The feel of his fingers on my scalp is like pure heaven.</p><p>\u201cTilt your head back under the water,\u201d he instructs.</p><p>I do as told and let the water wash the shampoo away. Without even being asked, Jake applies conditioner to my hair, knowing my thick hair needs it.</p><p>He combs the conditioner through my long hair to the ends with his fingers.</p><p>\u201cI love you, totally and completely,\u201d I say, looking at his perfect face. \u201cThank you for taking such good care of me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo need to thank me, baby. I want to take care of you. I kind of love you totally and completely too, you know.\u201d He gives me one of his trademark beautiful smiles. Not the one for his adoring fans. No, these smiles are reserved for me only. As he is. Mine, and mine alone.</p><p>How did I ever get so lucky to get this beautiful man back in my life? He is everything that means perfect to me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I\u2019m sick, spoiling our holiday,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d He chucks my chin with his finger. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you asked to be sick. I came here to spend time alone with you, sick or not. That\u2019s what we\u2019re doing, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I say with a smile. \u201cYou know...\u201d I continue softly, adding a touch of seduction to my tone. \u201cIf I weren\u2019t sick, I would so absolutely be on my knees right now, taking you in my mouth, sucking this water off you.\u201d</p><p>I feel Jake tense, his grip on me tightening. \u201cAnd I would have been so totally on board with that. When you\u2019re better?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>After our shower, Jake wraps me in a soft bath towel and carries me to the bedroom. He dries my skin with tenderness and precision, then dresses me in clean shorts and a vest and puts me back to bed and climbs in beside me.</p> <p>Suddenly exhausted, I shuffle over, resting my head against his hard chest and closing my eyes. Jake\u2019s arms wrap around me. Kissing my damp hair, he whispers, \u201cSleep, baby.\u201d</p><p>And I do.</p><p>I wake to the sound of Jake\u2019s hushed, angry voice coming from somewhere nearby.</p><p>\u201cThis is a fuckin\u2019 joke. I can\u2019t believe this even happened. What are we paying these fuckers for? Aren\u2019t they supposed to notice shit like this early? I can\u2019t believe it slipped through.\u201d</p><p>Then I hear another male voice I don\u2019t recognise.</p><p>\u201cI know. I thought they were reliable. They\u2019ve worked for us for years. Never missed a thing. I take full responsibility on this, Jake. I was the one who hired them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not your fault, Zane. It\u2019s the shit who\u2019s been skimming for the past six months. I swear, when I get my hands on that fucker...\u201d</p><p>Glancing around, I see it\u2019s 7:30 a.m. on the clock. I can\u2019t believe how long I\u2019ve slept.</p><p>Feeling a whole lot better than yesterday, and wanting to find out what\u2019s making Jake so angry, I climb out of bed and make my way to the living room.</p><p>I find him sitting at the dinner table, taking a video call on his laptop.</p><p>He looks up, his face taut, his eyes piercing blue, but they instantly soften.</p><p>Zane is still talking. \u201cThe accountant is still working on getting the exact amount, but he figures it sits around five hundred. When he gets back to me, I\u2019ll call you straightaway.\u201d</p><p>I see Jake\u2019s jaw tighten. His eyes flicker from mine back to the screen. \u201cOkay. I\u2019ll speak to you later.\u201d</p><p>Jake closes the laptop. \u201cWhat are you doing out of bed?\u201d he asks in a soft voice. Much softer than the tension lines around his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI missed you.\u201d Padding across the floor, I walk over to him.</p><p>He pushes his chair back, allowing me to climb in his lap. I snuggle my head into his chest. He smells of everything Jake\u2014shower gel, cigarettes, and mint. I never thought I could love such a combination until him. But then I didn\u2019t think I was capable of a lot of things until Jake.</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cBetter than I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you hungry?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. The thought of food still makes me want to gag.</p><p>\u201cBaby\u201d\u2014he presses a kiss to the top of my head, his hot breath blowing through my hair\u2014\u201cit\u2019s been ages since you last ate; you really should try something. How about some toast?\u201d</p><p>I tilt my head back, looking at his face. \u201cAre you going to bug me until I eat something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s quite likely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I say with a sigh. \u201cI\u2019ll try some toast.\u201d</p><p>Jake picks his phone up off the table and calls through to the restaurant.</p><p>After eating breakfast on the terrace, Jake and I go down to the beach for a walk. The food has perked me up a bit.</p><p>I know he still has the call with Zane on his mind. He was notably quiet over breakfast, and he still is now.</p><p>I figure it\u2019s something to do with the label. Something is going on there, and I want to know what.</p><p>\u201cAre you ever going to tell me what that video call was about?\u201d</p><p>Jake\u2019s hand tightens around mine. \u201cIt was nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJake...,\u201d I push.</p><p>\u201cLook, it\u2019s nothing big. We\u2019ll talk about it later. You\u2019re only just recovering from food poisoning, and we\u2019re still on vacation.\u201d</p><p>Stopping him, I come around and stand before him, wrapping my arms around his waist.</p><p>I tilt my head, looking up at him. \u201cNothing big, right? So why did you sound majorly pissed off when you were taking to that Zane guy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always sound pissed off when talking to the staff,\u201d he says with a grin.</p><p>\u201cStop it,\u201d I snap, taking a step back.</p><p>His brow furrows. \u201cStop what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop shutting me out, Jake. I wish you would just talk to me. Tell me when something is going on. I might actually be able to help.\u201d</p><p>Moving closer, he rests his arms on my shoulders, running his fingers into my hair. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to shut you out. I just don\u2019t want you worrying about unnecessary things. There\u2019s no point when I have a handle on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI worry more when I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. My imagination takes over, and you know how wild that can run.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d he says tenderly, running his thumb down my cheek.</p><p>\u201cLook, Jake, I just don\u2019t want...\u201d I let out a sigh. \u201cI just don\u2019t want things getting too hard for you, and for you to then...fall off the wagon, and for us to end up back where we did in Boston.\u201d</p><p>His body stiffens. His eyes darken. \u201cIt won\u2019t happen again. I already told you that. I\u2019m not losing you again. I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. And I believe in you, I do. I just know I\u2019d feel a whole lot better if you shared more with me, instead of keeping me out of the loop. I know you\u2019re doing what you think is best for me, but you are what\u2019s best for me\u2014you happy and healthy.\u201d</p><p>He leans down, hands holding my face, and presses his forehead against mine, closing his eyes.</p><p>For a moment, I stay still, just listening to his deep, contented breaths.</p><p>Sometimes I feel like Jake breathes through me. Because of me. That I\u2019m the air he needs. And I breathe in the knowledge of his contentment within me.</p><p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s been stealing money from the company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat!\u201d I lean back from him, air whooshing out of my lungs.</p><p>Jake sighs, then, taking my hand, he encourages me to sit down beside him on the sand.</p><p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s been skimming for the past six months. And it\u2019s not the money, Tru,\u201d he says, exhaling. \u201cI can take the hit for the cash. It\u2019s just the fact that someone has fuckin\u2019 stolen from me. Stolen from what Jonny and I created.\u201d He drags a hand through his hair. \u201cIt just feels like they\u2019re pissing on his memory, you know?\u201d He shrugs, then his shoulders hang heavily forward.</p><p>The pain in his voice slices through me.</p><p>I hate that after everything Jake has been through in his life, just when things are getting straight for him, someone does this to him. Anger burns in me, but I hide it. I don\u2019t want him to know it\u2019s affecting me. I want him to keep talking to me.</p><p>\u201cI know, baby,\u201d I say, taking his hand, trying to ease his pain and frustration. \u201cDo you have any idea who it might be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d he says with a shake of his head. \u201cWe\u2019re keeping this on the down low, not letting the staff know, so we can catch the fucker out. With Zane on the case, it won\u2019t be long before we know. That guy could sniff out shit in a garbage dump.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is Zane?\u201d I ask.</p><p>He glances at me, confused. \u201cZane Fox. He\u2019s the VP at the label.\u201d</p><p>How do I not know this? I should know this. I\u2019m soon going to marry this man, and I know so little about his business and the people who work for him. The knowledge makes me feel like crap.</p><p>\u201cHow long has Zane worked for you?\u201d I trace my fingertip over his rough, calloused fingers.</p><p>\u201cFrom the start. Jonny and I hired him when we set up the label. This is stinging him as much as it is me.\u201d</p><p>Okay, mental note. Spend time getting to know Jake\u2019s employees better. Except the one who\u2019s ripping him off. That one I\u2019ll happily kick the shit out of.</p><p>\u201cYou definitely think he\u2019ll be able to get to the bottom of the theft without you there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He digs a finger into the sand and draws a deep line in it.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t sound sure. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because he lacks confidence in Zane. I think it\u2019s because he feels like he\u2019s somehow failing Jonny by letting this happen in the first place. He\u2019s not there now sorting it because he\u2019s here with me.</p><p>He\u2019s been so tied up lately with me, with us, that his mind has been off his business. I know right now his loyalty is torn between me and his company.</p><p>I hate that more than I can express.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going back to LA,\u201d I say. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo, we\u2019re not.\u201d His tone is resolute.</p><p>Changing tack and looking for some leverage in my argument, I ask, \u201cHow much money has been taken?\u201d</p><p>He shifts before he speaks, and looks out over the ocean. \u201cThe accountant figures about five hundred thousand dollars. I\u2019m just waiting to get the exact figure from Zane once he\u2019s spoken with the accountant again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive. Hundred. Fucking. Thousand. Dollars!\u201d I gasp. \u201cSomeone has stolen five hundred thousand dollars from you?\u201d</p> <p>If I was angry before, I\u2019m bloody raging now.</p><p>He slides me a look. \u201cFrom the business, but basically, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to go back to LA, Jake. You need to get back and sort this out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we\u2019re\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say firmly. \u201cThis is huge. This is fraud we\u2019re talking about here. Fraud against your company. A huge amount of fucking fraud! When did you find out about this?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYesterday.\u201d</p><p>I give him a pissed-off look. \u201cYou should have told me yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTru, don\u2019t be ridiculous, you were sick. Look I\u2019m telling you now like you asked.\u201d He brings my hand to his lips and kisses it. \u201cI know you\u2019re worried, which is exactly what I didn\u2019t want, but here we are. No fuckin\u2019 way are we leaving this island for another three days. I\u2019m on vacation with my girl\u2014and no, you\u2019re not keeping me from my business obligations,\u201d he interjects, cutting me off with his finger to my lips when I open my mouth to protest. \u201cYes, the label is having some problems. Problems that Zane is more than capable of handling for another three days until I get back.\u201d</p><p>Staring into my eyes, he traces his fingertip over my lower lip, tugging it down ever so slightly.</p><p>I watch his pupils dilate. And I feel the air instantly shift between us.</p><p>My nipples harden. I\u2019m not wearing a bra under my vest, so they put on an obvious show to Jake.</p> <p>His eyes darken further as they move downward, over my breasts.</p><p>\u201cIf you want to help me, Tru, then give me this time with you,\u201d he says, his voice rough. \u201cIt\u2019s what I need right now. You are what I need right now.\u201d</p><p>Knowing exactly what Jake needs, and more than willing to give it to him, I climb onto his lap, straddling him. \u201cOkay,\u201d I say. \u201cWe\u2019ll do this your way.\u201d</p><p>Giving me a sexy smile, he rests his large hands on my behind. \u201cWhat do you want to do today?\u201d he asks with blatant sex in his voice.</p><p>I reach between us and palm him through his shorts. \u201cI want you inside me\u2014\u201d</p><p>Apparently I don\u2019t need to say anything more. Jake is on his feet in one swift move, taking me with him, and he carries me back to our villa in record time.</p><p>The instant we\u2019re inside, he sets me down and tears my vest off. And yes, I mean he\u2019s ripped it off.</p><p>Fuck, he\u2019s strong, and it\u2019s so totally hot.</p> <p>My shorts and panties are next. Thankfully, they avoid a tearing, as he whips them down my legs in one go.</p><p>I\u2019ve been stripped bare in a matter of seconds. Only Jake could make tearing my clothes off a show of how strong his love is for me.</p><p>I love that he can make me feel so wanted and cherished.</p><p>\u201cFuck, I\u2019ve missed this...you.\u201d His eyes devour me for long seconds, then his mouth is on mine. Taking me with him in a few strides, he has me flat on my back on the bed.</p><p>Moving down my body, he takes my nipple into his mouth and runs his tongue around it. Heat pools in my core, leaving me wet and wanting, and I moan with need and desire.</p><p>He grazes his teeth over my nipple, then moving down and off me, he kneels on the floor by the bed, grabs me by the thighs, and yanks me forward.</p><p>I gasp.</p><p>My legs are set to rest on his shoulders, and he slides a finger over my sex.</p><p>\u201cSo wet,\u201d he rasps.</p><p>Knowing what he\u2019s about to do, I close my eyes and let my head fall back into the comfort of the bed.</p><p>\u201cWatch me,\u201d he commands.</p><p>Inclining, resting up on my elbows, I look at him.</p><p>\u201cI want you to watch me...make you come.\u201d</p><p>Jake\u2019s never asked me to watch him before. I don\u2019t really care what\u2019s made him ask\u2014I\u2019m just glad he did, because it\u2019s so fucking sexy. He\u2019s so fucking sexy.</p><p>Doing as he asks, I stay inclined and keep my eyes fixed on him.</p><p>I watch as he runs his tongue over his upper lip, like he tastes me already. His bright blue eyes darken to inky as he leans forward and puts his mouth close to my sex. Then he very slowly licks his tongue over my sensitive bud, all the while not moving his eyes from mine.</p><p>\u201cMmm, so sweet,\u201d he murmurs.</p><p>I\u2019m riveted.</p><p>Watching him tend to me in this way is mind-blowing. It elevates the sensation of his touch to a level I didn\u2019t even know existed. It\u2019s insanely sensual watching as Jake\u2019s tongue moves over the most intimate part of me, in the most intimate way. What makes me nearly lose control is seeing the pleasure on his face while he\u2019s doing it.</p><p>My hands fist in the sheets when he blows over my already sensitised clit, driving the sensations higher and me wilder.</p><p>I want him inside me now.</p><p>Jake pushes a finger inside me as he continues to lick me to crazy with his tongue, and I instantly clench around it.</p><p>\u201cYou want it...my cock inside you?\u201d he murmurs, sending vibrations humming over my sex.</p><p>\u201cGod, yes,\u201d I moan.</p><p>His blue eyes flicker to mine, hitting me with his sex-hot gaze, as he pushes another finger in me and starts to fuck me with them. Then he continues his sweet assault of my senses with his tongue.</p><p>\u201cAh, yes,\u201d I breathe, clutching my own breast, the tension inside me building to insane. My core tightens in response to his maddening licks. \u201cYes, Jake...oh, please...right there...holy fuck, I\u2019m coming!\u201d I suddenly cry out.</p><p>Like a bolt of lightning searing through me, the orgasm tears through my body, arching my back off the bed. Jake pins my hips down with his free hand, continuing to draw the orgasm out, while I move under him as he climaxes me to epic proportions.</p><p>I\u2019ve gone two days without this, without him, and apparently I was ready. More ready than I had realised.</p><p>As the sensations ebb, I sag into the bed, replete and boneless.</p><p>In my hazy orgasmic vision, I see Jake peeling off his T-shirt and reaching for his shorts.</p><p>Forcing myself up, I stand on wobbly legs and stop his hands with mine.</p><p>\u201cLet me.\u201d</p><p>Jake is always pleasuring me. Now it\u2019s my turn to please him.</p><p>I hook my fingers into the waistband of his shorts. Pulling them down, I follow them on their journey, my knees hitting the floor the moment they do. Jake kicks them aside, while my gaze alights on his thick cock.</p><p>Without hesitation, I take him in my hand and place my lips over his crown, drawing him into my mouth.</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d Jake groans, his body jerking at the feel of me around him. He grabs a fistful of my hair, steadying himself. \u201cThe feel of your mouth gets me every time, Tru, it\u2019s so fuckin\u2019 warm...so soft.\u201d</p><p>The silk and steeliness of him makes me moan.</p><p>I feel a shudder move through him.</p><p>I flicker my tongue on the underside, pull back slightly, lick the tip, then take him back in my mouth. I feel a burst of pre-cum hit my tongue.</p><p>Greedily swallowing it, I start to fist him farther into my mouth, sucking hard, taking in as much of him as I can.</p><p>\u201cTru, your mouth...so hot...you suck me so good.\u201d</p><p>Pleased that I\u2019m pleasing him, I brace my hand against his hard thigh, relaxing my jaw, taking even more of him in my mouth.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d he growls. Taking hold of my head with his other hand, knotting his fingers into my hair, he starts to fuck my mouth.</p><p>\u201cGod...Tru...ah, we need to stop...I\u2019m, ah, Jesus...I\u2019m gonna come.\u201d He starts to pull back, trying to remove himself from my mouth. But I want him to come in my mouth. I\u2019ve missed the taste of him.</p><p>I tighten my hold on his thigh, removing my hand from his cock, gripping his other thigh, trying to keep him in place, letting him know my intention.</p><p>\u201cNo, baby, you\u2019ve been sick, you don\u2019t need me coming in your mouth.\u201d</p><p>I glance up at him.</p><p>He shakes his head gently, running his fingers down my cheek. \u201cNext time. Right now, I just want to come inside that gorgeous body of yours.\u201d</p><p>I give him one last remembering suck, then let him guide me to my feet.</p><p>Jake\u2019s eyes are blazing. I know how hard it must have been for him to stop.</p><p>I run my tongue over my upper lip. Jake\u2019s eyes follow it.</p><p>\u201cWhere do you want me?\u201d I whisper.</p><p>He inhales sharply. \u201cBend over and brace your hands against the wall.\u201d There\u2019s no conversation in his tone.</p><p>Loving the command, legs trembling, I do exactly as he says. I bend over and place my palms flat against the wall by the bed, more than ready.</p><p>I feel Jake move behind me. He nudges my legs farther apart with his knee, then I feel the head of his cock press against my entrance.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna fuck you, baby. Hard. You ready?\u201d I don\u2019t have to see him to know his teeth are gritted together, that his restraint is almost gone.</p><p>Keen, I push my hips back against him. \u201cWhat are you waiting for?\u201d</p><p>Jake grabs hold of my hips and slams into me in one swift move, jolting me forward.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d he bites out.</p><p>I steady myself against the wall as Jake pulls my hips back.</p><p>He eases out of me, then drives into me again with a long, hard thrust. I can\u2019t help the loud moan that escapes me.</p><p>Jake\u2019s grip on me tightens to near pain, holding me in place, but I don\u2019t care. I need this. I need him.</p><p>\u201cTalk to me in Spanish, sweetheart,\u201d he growls.</p><p>A smile sweeps my lips. Knowing exactly what this does to him, I comply readily. \u201cNo me jodas m\u00e1s, Jake. Harder!\u201d</p><p>Jake loves the Puerto Rican in me, and the sound of me speaking Spanish drives him crazy.</p><p>Any reserve he had left is gone, and he starts fucking me hard and ruthless, talking sex to me. \u201cJesus, Tru, you\u2019re so fuckin\u2019 sexy with that dirty mouth of yours. You feel so fuckin\u2019 tight and hot. I\u2019m so hard...fucking you deep...\u201d</p><p>I can feel him growing even bigger inside me, hitting that spot, the one hidden deep within me. It\u2019s only ever been touched by Jake, and I know he\u2019s getting near.</p><p>He moves his hand around to my sex and rubs my clit with his finger, urging me on to another orgasm.</p><p>My muscles start to tighten and spasm as he thrusts his big cock in and out of me.</p><p>\u201cCome, Tru. Now.\u201d</p><p>My body bows to his command, and I climax in a lust-fuelled haze of his dominance, my core tightening around him.</p><p>I feel him shudder. \u201cFuck, Tru!\u201d he cries out, and I feel the heat of him spurt into me, his hips jerking, ramming into me, as he fills me with his semen.</p><p>When he\u2019s given everything to me, Jake brushes my hair aside and lays his chest against my back, resting his hands over mine against the wall.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d he asks softly, kissing my shoulder, his teeth gently grazing my skin.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m better than okay.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He shifts his hips, and I can feel that he\u2019s still semihard inside me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not done?\u201d I push back against him, smiling.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve not even started. I\u2019ve gone two days without being inside you.\u201d His arm comes around my waist. Sliding out of me, he spins me around to face him, yanking me up hard against his body. \u201cI intend to make up on that time and spend the rest of the day inside you, fucking you senseless, until neither of us can walk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that a promise?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou bet your sweet ass it is,\u201d he growls as he picks me up and throws me down onto the bed, climbing on top of me.</p><p>CHAPTER THREE</p><p>I look down at the lights of LA as the jet heads for LAX.</p><p>Jake is sleeping beside me. I reach over and brush his fallen hair off his forehead. He looks so peaceful. I hate to wake him, but we\u2019ll be coming in to land soon.</p><p>I glance down at my friendship bracelet on his wrist. Shifting it aside, I see where his skin is lighter underneath, where it\u2019s been hidden from the sun. The same as mine. We never take them off\u2014a promise made to each other to always wear the reminder of our childhood connection\u2014the bracelets I made for us both all those years ago.</p> <p>I can\u2019t believe our holiday is over. The best holiday of my life. Now we\u2019re heading back to reality.</p><p>Well, Jake\u2019s reality.</p><p>Which is so far from any reality I could have ever imagined.</p><p>An ordinary girl in a far-from-ordinary world.</p><p>I wish we could have stayed on the island indefinitely, because I have a feeling that coming back here means things are about to get very real, very quickly.</p><p>Curving my fingertips around Jake\u2019s ear, I tickle the sensitive skin behind it. The spot that drives him crazy when I kiss him there.</p> <p>He catches my wrist, surprising me. \u201cDon\u2019t start something you can\u2019t win,\u201d he says with a sexy growl to his voice.</p><p>\u201cWho says I can\u2019t win?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d He moves in closer, revealing his stunningly blue eyes. \u201cYou forget I know exactly where all of your sensitive spots are, Bennett.\u201d</p><p>Heat floods me and I squirm. \u201cI thought you were asleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was until some little minx started tickling me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMinx?\u201d I let out a laugh.</p> <p>\u201cYep, that\u2019s you. A minx. Cunning and flirtatious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFlirtatious?\u201d I scoff.</p><p>\u201cYep, flirtatious and irresistible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeant for you,\u201d I add.</p><p>\u201cFucking right, meant for me.\u201d</p><p>His gaze pins me to the seat, possessing me, owning me.</p><p>Holding back a gulp, I say, \u201cWell, python, we\u2019re home.\u201d A light smile settles on my lips.</p><p>Home.</p><p>LA is my home now. It feels strange to say.</p><p>The last time I was in LA, the story of Jake\u2019s dad had just broken in the news.</p><p>I shudder at the memory.</p><p>Jake sits up in his seat, stretching his legs out, his arms go over his head, then one comes down to rest on my shoulder, pulling me to him. \u201cYou okay?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cYeah, just wishing we\u2019d had longer together on the island.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d he murmurs, resting his chin on the top of my head. \u201cWe\u2019ll go back there again one day real soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could take our honeymoon there,\u201d I suggest, optimism filling me, as I look up at him.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a great idea.\u201d He smiles.</p><p>\u201cGuess I need to start planning our wedding, then...or did you want a long engagement?\u201d I bite my lip.</p><p>\u201cFuck no! Baby, we can get married tomorrow if you want. You just say the word and I\u2019ll tell the pilot to take us to Vegas.\u201d</p><p>I let out a laugh. \u201cMy mother would have a seizure if I got married in Vegas, and my dad would kick your ass for taking away his chance to walk his only child down the aisle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoint taken. I really don\u2019t want an ass-kicking from Billy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere do you want to get married? Here or the UK?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind.\u201d He shrugs. \u201cI guess it would be easier to get married here because we live here, but honestly the choice is yours. If you want to get married in Manchester, it\u2019s cool with me. You just tell me the time and the place, baby, and I\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I to take it you\u2019ll be having absolutely no input in this wedding whatsoever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I will,\u201d he says, grinning. \u201cI\u2019ll be organising my bachelor party. No, scrap that. I promised Tom he could do it.\u201d</p><p>Tom is the bassist in TMS, one of Jake\u2019s closest friends, and renowned player. The same as Jake was before we got together, but now he\u2019s with me and that\u2019s all behind him. Thankfully.</p><p>\u201cOh God,\u201d I groan. \u201cIt\u2019ll be a shagfest, filled with lap dancers and hookers. I\u2019m envisioning Hangover 2 right now.\u201d</p><p>Jake laughs. \u201cAh, give him some credit, baby. It won\u2019t be that bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you turn up with a tattoo on your face, telling me you\u2019ve shagged a lady boy, I\u2019m definitely not marrying you.\u201d</p><p>He fixes me with a stare. \u201cSweetheart, if I have to tell you I shagged a lady boy, I\u2019ll be telling you from prison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019ll have fuckin\u2019 killed Tom for letting it happen.\u201d</p><p>We both start laughing, as the pilot comes on the intercom to tell us to buckle up because we\u2019re coming in to land.</p><p>Dave pulls into the drive outside Jake\u2019s house. I mean our house. I still haven\u2019t gotten used to saying that. And I would never say this to Jake, but it doesn\u2019t feel like my house.</p><p>Because, well, I kind of hate his house...okay, maybe hate\u2019s too strong a word.</p><p>I intensely dislike Jake\u2019s house.</p><p>Don\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s beautiful. Not overly flashy. Modern. It has three bedrooms, three bathrooms, a music studio, and a gym.</p><p>But it\u2019s a bachelor pad. And that\u2019s the problem.</p><p>It was Jake\u2019s bachelor pad that he brought countless women back to.</p><p>God, just thinking about it makes me want to hurl.</p><p>I\u2019ve never had sex with Jake at his house before. During the short stay we had here between tour dates, sex wasn\u2019t exactly on either of our minds.</p><p>But now I live here, and Jake\u2019s going to want to have sex\u2014a lot\u2014and I know I\u2019ll be thinking of the countless other women here before me. In Jake\u2019s house. In his bed.</p><p>The bed that I\u2019m going to share with him.</p><p>I hate that more than I can express.</p><p>Ugh.</p><p>I know I\u2019m being overly sensitive, and I know Jake has never lived here with a woman before. That counts for something.</p><p>This is his home. My home now. I\u2019m going to have to get used to it.</p><p>How? I\u2019m not entirely sure, because currently I feel like the memory of his old life lingers like a bad smell when I\u2019m in his house.</p><p>My house.</p><p>Crap.</p><p>I really need to get used to referring to it as \u201cmy house,\u201d otherwise Jake will notice, and I don\u2019t want to upset him. I don\u2019t need to be stirring up any of my issues with his past.</p><p>\u201cJust drop the cases in the hall and get yourselves home,\u201d Jake says to Dave and Ben, unlocking the front door, letting me in first.</p><p>I see the light is on in the kitchen, and hoping that one of my favourite people in the world is here, I say good-bye to Dave and Ben and head straight for the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cChica!\u201d Stuart beams at me as I enter through the archway. \u201cAren\u2019t you just a sight for sore eyes? Look at you, all tanned and beautiful. What I wouldn\u2019t give for your colouring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe perks of having a Puerto Rican mother.\u201d I walk into his open embrace, planting a kiss on his cheek. \u201cI missed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? You had time to miss me? You\u2019re telling me the infamous snake over there didn\u2019t keep you busy while you were away?\u201d Stuart nods in Jake\u2019s direction. Jake is leaning against the archway, watching us.</p><p>His face looks blank. Sometimes I have a hard time assessing Jake\u2019s mood. It\u2019s only his eyes that have the ability to give him away. Not this time, though.</p><p>\u201cOh, he kept me plenty busy.\u201d I share a secret smile in Jake\u2019s direction, one that flickers in his eyes, bringing them to life.</p><p>I can almost see what he\u2019s thinking, and my cheeks flush at the memories of the many things we got up to on holiday.</p><p>\u201cBut I still found time to miss my favourite guy,\u201d I add, turning back to Stuart.</p><p>\u201cI thought I was your favourite guy?\u201d Jake says with mock annoyance, coming over, taking a seat at the breakfast bar.</p><p>\u201cGet in line, man. Hos before bros.\u201d Stuart clamps his arm around my shoulder.</p><p>I snort, then clamp my hand over my mouth.</p><p>Not attractive, I know. Snorts just happen sometimes, unexpectedly.</p><p>\u201cGod, I feel like I\u2019m in an episode of One Tree Hill,\u201d Jake complains.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a moody bastard after a flight.\u201d Stuart waves him away with his hand. \u201cSo you guys had a good time?\u201d he asks, directing his question at me.</p><p>\u201cThe best! You\u2019ll have to come next time, Stuart. It\u2019s amazing there, you would love it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want Stuart to come on our honeymoon with us?\u201d Jake raises an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cOh, right, of course. Okay, so the next time after that.\u201d I smile.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s that good that it\u2019s going to be the honeymoon destination?\u201d Stuart questions, a glint in his eye.</p><p>\u201cThat good.\u201d I nod, smiling at the memory of the island.</p><p>\u201cSo you guys have set a date?\u201d Stuart releases me and leans up against the counter.</p><p>Taking off my jacket, I hang it on the back of the stool across from Jake and hop up onto it. \u201cNot yet, but I\u2019m going to start planning tomorrow...well, start figuring out how exactly to plan a wedding and set a date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you need a hand, gorgeous, just let me know,\u201d he offers.</p><p>\u201cI might just take you up on that. Ooh, you made tea.\u201d I smile, noticing the brewing pot on the side. \u201cCould I love you any more?\u201d I jump down from my stool and nudge Stuart with my hip.</p><p>\u201cNot too fuckin\u2019 much, I hope,\u201d Jake mutters, reaching over to get a biscuit out of the barrel.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, baby. I love Stuart in a purely platonic way. He\u2019s like the brother I never had.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAww, honey, that\u2019s lovely.\u201d Stuart smiles at me, nudging me with his hip.</p><p>\u201cI thought I was the brother you never had all those years growing up.\u201d Jake\u2019s brow furrows.</p><p>\u201cJake, if I had ever looked at you in a brotherly way growing up, then we would never have ended up having sex in our adulthood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShame I didn\u2019t know how you felt back then.\u201d Jake\u2019s face relaxes into a sexy grin. \u201cJust imagine all the things we could have gotten up to in your bedroom instead of doing our homework.\u201d</p><p>My eyebrow lifts, and my panties nearly drop of their own accord.</p><p>\u201cStill here,\u201d Stuart says, cutting into the spell Jake\u2019s put me under. \u201cAnd I\u2019m suffering from a long dry spell, so please cut out the sex talk. Right, let\u2019s get to the important matter,\u201d Stuart adds, rubbing his hands together. \u201cOne of you give me my gift already. I\u2019m dying here!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGift?\u201d I give Stuart a puzzled look, then direct one to Jake, who shrugs. He\u2019s in on my little bit. \u201cWe were supposed to get you a gift?\u201d</p><p>I start to pour tea from the pot into three waiting cups, suppressing a smile.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t fuck around. Come on, duty-free purchases are part of my contract. Gimme.\u201d He proffers his hand, curling his fingers up in an impatient gesture.</p><p>I put down the teapot. Holding a steady face, I bite my lip for effect. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry, Stuart. I didn\u2019t realise we were supposed to get you anything.\u201d</p> <p>I see the light disappear in his eyes. His face drops. \u201cOh, it\u2019s okay, honey, don\u2019t worry...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean, I didn\u2019t realise gifts were part of your contract, so I guess it\u2019s a good job I got you these Oliver Peoples aviators,\u201d I say, reaching over and pulling them from out of my jacket pocket.</p><p>Stuart\u2019s been hankering after a pair of these but they\u2019ve been sold out everywhere\u2014I didn\u2019t even know sunglasses could sell out\u2014so I asked Jake to pull some strings and get a pair directly from the designer. Which, of course, he did. The perks of being Jake. They were waiting at LAX for me to pick up.</p><p>\u201cHoly fuck!\u201d Stuart says. \u201cHow did you...? Never mind. These are so totally fucking awesome! You are so totally fucking awesome!\u201d</p><p>He picks me up and spins me around, then sets me back on my feet. He takes the sunglasses from my hand and puts them on.</p> <p>\u201cHow do I look?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look amazing. They totally suit you. You know, with those sunglasses on, you look a bit like that model. You know the British one, David Gandy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore like Gandhi,\u201d Jake quips.</p><p>I can\u2019t not laugh at that.</p><p>\u201cFuck off!\u201d Stuart says, admiring himself in the glass of the oven door. \u201cYou\u2019re just jealous you wouldn\u2019t be able to carry off something so stylish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, hottest male two thousand and twelve here, as voted by the great American public.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think they were voting for the snake, not you.\u201d Stuart smirks, inferring to the nickname for Jake\u2019s huge...anatomy. The one he regularly uses on me.</p><p>\u201cSo anyway, chica, this David Gandy dude...is he hot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, so totally and completely hot.\u201d I nod enthusiastically.</p><p>\u201cUhum,\u201d Jake clears his throat loudly.</p><p>\u201cBut not as hot as you, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn straight,\u201d Jake mutters.</p><p>\u201cOn that note, I\u2019m going to bed to spend the rest of the night looking at myself in the mirror and researching pics of this hot Gandy dude.\u201d</p><p>Stuart picks up his tea and heads out of the kitchen with a wave of his hand. \u201cGood to have you back,\u201d he says to us both.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to be back.\u201d I half mean that. \u201cSleep well,\u201d I call after him.</p><p>\u201cYou too, chica.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know...\u201d Jake says, pouring milk into the two remaining teas. He picks one up and hands it to me. \u201cStuart is the only man I will tolerate mauling you. And that\u2019s only because he\u2019s as gay as they come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStuart doesn\u2019t maul me.\u201d I laugh. I take a sip of my tea, then set it down. \u201cHe\u2019s just a tactile guy. I like tactile people,\u201d I add, positioning myself between his legs.</p><p>\u201cYeah? Well, if any man ever touches you here\u201d\u2014he brushes his finger over my lips\u2014\u201cI\u2019ll kick his ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about here?\u201d I point to my breasts.</p><p>\u201cHospitalised for sure,\u201d he replies, eyes now glued to my boobs.</p><p>\u201cWhat about here?\u201d I point to the V between my thighs.</p><p>\u201cStone-cold fucking dead. You belong to me, Tru.\u201d He lifts my skirt and puts his hand to the very place I just pointed to. \u201cNo one touches you but me.\u201d</p><p>He presses his fingers into my panties. Into me.</p><p>Heat consumes my body, firing through me.</p><p>He\u2019s fucked other women here.</p><p>I step back, letting his hand fall away.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d He looks confused.</p><p>\u201cNothing...\u201d I glance around, looking for my excuse. \u201cIt\u2019s just...Stuart might come back.\u201d</p><p>I wonder if he\u2019s ever had sex in the kitchen. Probably. Knowing Jake, he\u2019ll have utilised every room in this house.</p><p>The very thought makes me want to throw up.</p><p>My fingers curl into my hand, my nails biting into my skin.</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t come back.\u201d Jake hooks his fingers into my T-shirt and reels me back in.</p><p>He starts to kiss my neck, his other hand grabbing my ass, pulling me closer to him.</p><p>Crap, he\u2019s hard. But then, Jake\u2019s always hard.</p><p>I close my eyes and try to get into it. The feel of him pressed up against me. His hard body. His masculine scent.</p><p>But all I can see in my mind is a preconceived image of Jake with another woman. Him doing exactly what he\u2019s doing to me, to her, right here.</p><p>I wriggle out of his embrace.</p><p>He sighs, and his darkened eyes meet mine. \u201cOkay, what the fuck\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d My voice has gone squeaky. Traitor voice.</p><p>\u201cTru?\u201d</p><p>I glance down at my feet. \u201cI just...\u201d I bite my lip.</p><p>\u201cYou just, what?\u201d There\u2019s no happy in his tone.</p><p>\u201cI just feel weird having sex in your house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean our house.\u201d His eyebrow lifts. \u201cAnd why? Because Stuart lives here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Because of all the women you\u2019ve fucked here.\u201d Okay, so that didn\u2019t come out exactly as I had intended.</p><p>I look up, meeting his eyes, biting my lip, hard.</p><p>Jake\u2019s face is a mask.</p><p>I also note he doesn\u2019t deny that he\u2019s screwed other women here.</p><p>I know it was a long shot, but I was harbouring a tiny flicker of hope that maybe he\u2019d never brought a woman back here.</p><p>Stupid, right?</p><p>Sighing, he shoves a hand through his black hair.</p><p>I move farther away, increasing the gap between us, and lean against the counter. \u201cHow many women have you had here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you really want me to answer that question?\u201d His eyes burn into mine, waiting.</p><p>Looking away, I focus on the wall. I fiddle with the hem of my T-shirt.</p><p>Do I really want to know?</p><p>The sadistic side of me does. Thankfully self-preservation wins out.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I shake my head.</p><p>Pushing off the counter, I start to walk away. I just want to go to bed, sleep, and leave this conversation behind.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>I stop by the archway and turn back to him. \u201cTo bed. It\u2019s okay, Jake. I get your past, I do...sort of.\u201d I drag my fingers through my hair. \u201cAnd I know there\u2019s nothing you can do to change it, no matter how much I may wish it. But I can\u2019t pretend that at times it doesn\u2019t bother me...affect me.\u201d I point. \u201cOut there, I can cope with it, mostly...but in here, our home...just knowing that you\u2019ve been...with hundreds of women...here.\u201d I try to shake the sick-inducing images out of my mind.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not hundreds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t brought hundreds of women here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for the clarification.\u201d My tone is sharper than I mean it to be. \u201cLook, however many it is, it\u2019s more than one, and that\u2019s enough to have me feeling like this. I just need a little time to figure out how to get around it\u2014being here, knowing that. And don\u2019t think I\u2019m punishing you because of your past, because I\u2019m not. It\u2019s just my own jealousy and insecurities getting the better of me. Just give me time to figure out how to get past it, okay?\u201d</p><p>I can see his hands curled around the edge of the stool, knuckles white from the intensity of his grip. He looks like he is having to physically restrain himself from coming over to me. I can almost smell his need to touch me in the air, floating around me like a physical presence.</p><p>I need to touch him too. Just without these images in my head.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he sighs. He sounds defeated. \u201cI\u2019ll follow you up to bed in a minute.\u201d</p><p>Leaving him where he sits, I go upstairs, get dressed for bed, and brush my teeth. When I reemerge from the bathroom, there\u2019s still no sign of Jake.</p><p>Turning off the light, I climb in bed, and for the first night in a long time, I fall asleep without Jake beside me.</p><p>CHAPTER FOUR</p><p>You promise you can\u2019t see anything?\u201d Jake asks for the tenth time.</p><p>\u201cI promise I can\u2019t see anything.\u201d I sigh, feeling a little exasperated and a lot blind.</p><p>I\u2019m currently sitting in the passenger seat of Jake\u2019s treasured Aston Martin DBS, aka the James Bond car.</p><p>Jake\u2019s driving, and I\u2019m wearing a blindfold.</p><p>Yes, a blindfold.</p><p>A makeshift one, made from the silk scarf I was wearing.</p><p>Why?</p><p>Because Jake has a surprise for me. A surprise that apparently requires me to be blindfolded to get it.</p><p>We\u2019ve been back in LA for five days.</p><p>Jake has spent most of that time at the label, dealing with the accountants, trying to sort things out with the fraud. It\u2019s definitely five hundred thousand dollars stolen, but they are no closer to finding out who took it.</p><p>It\u2019s consuming all of his time. He is literally getting home as I\u2019m heading to bed, and he\u2019s gone when I wake.</p><p>Am I worried about the strain this will be putting him under?</p><p>Absolutely.</p><p>Am I checking for visual signs of him using again?</p><p>Definitely.</p><p>I hate that I am, but he\u2019s not long clean. I would be stupid not to be a little worried. I don\u2019t want either of us to go through what we did before.</p><p>It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t trust him, I do. I just know how easily a slip can happen. I watched it happen to him before and I was blind to it, and it got too far too fast.</p><p>I won\u2019t let that happen again.</p><p>Have I checked the cisterns in the toilets and other hidey holes in the house for drugs?</p><p>Yes.</p><p>I know it\u2019s horrible, checking on him like that, and I know he would be really angry if he knew. But when Jake\u2019s life is in play, nothing is more important.</p><p>I know he went to a meeting with his drug counsellor on our first day back, and I heard him on a call with someone I think is his sponsor late the night before last.</p><p>It\u2019s natural that he\u2019ll still be struggling, especially now back in the real world, surrounded by temptation. I\u2019m just glad he\u2019s making use of the professional support he has to help him get through it.</p><p>And I\u2019m here for whatever help he needs.</p><p>In my heart I don\u2019t think Jake will ever go back to drugs. I saw what the last episode did to him, losing us because of it.</p><p>It nearly broke him.</p><p>But it also doesn\u2019t hurt for me to keep alert for any signs of trouble.</p><p>Of course I ask him how he\u2019s doing, but I haven\u2019t asked directly about his recovery steps, because I know if he wants to talk to me about it, he will.</p><p>I\u2019ve missed him like crazy this last week. But the time apart has had its benefits. Now I\u2019m back from holiday, it\u2019s back to work, and I\u2019m glad for it, even if I am working from home. It\u2019s allowed me to get on with my work writing Jake\u2019s bio, and I\u2019ve also been working on my column for Etiquette. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Etiquette is the magazine I work for. Vicky, my boss and close friend, is the sole reason Jake and I came back into each other\u2019s lives. She landed an exclusive interview with Jake and sent me to do it.</p><p>I\u2019ve really missed my job, and the bonus of working means I need to talk to Vicky. Which is fab because I\u2019ve missed her tons as well.</p><p>God love Skype is all I can say.</p><p>I called my folks too on the telephone; apparently Skype is just too technological for my mum and dad.</p> <p>But mostly, I miss Simone.</p><p>I\u2019m used to seeing her every day, and it\u2019s taking some time getting used to not living in London with her anymore.</p><p>I may have called her multiple times over the last few days. And maybe I cried a few times while on the phone too.</p><p>I\u2019m just so glad I have Stuart, my only friend in LA. Aside from Jake, of course.</p><p>The downside of Jake not being around this week, apart from the obvious, is that we haven\u2019t talked about the \u201cno sex in his house\u201d issue since that night. Just like we never talked about the \u201cnot having kids\u201d issue on the island.</p> <p>It seems Jake and I are really good at ignoring things and avoiding discussions on important matters.</p><p>I wonder if that\u2019s partly why he\u2019s spent so much time at the label this week.</p><p>This is the longest Jake and I have gone without having sex since we got together. We\u2019ve gone from multiple times daily while on the island to nothing at all.</p><p>I know this is my doing, but I\u2019m starting to worry big-time, because Jake is a highly sexual man. For Jake, having sex is as essential as breathing, and the fact that he\u2019s not even trying to get it from me is worrying the shit out of me. I\u2019m scared that if he\u2019s not getting it from me, he\u2019ll start to look elsewhere. Or maybe he already has.</p><p>\u201cYou know, we could get pulled over by the cops. They might think you\u2019re kidnapping me, having me blindfolded like this,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cThe windows are tinted, sweetheart.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course they are.\u201d</p><p>I fold my arms over my chest at the sound of Jake\u2019s soft laughter.</p><p>\u201cWell, with the speed you drive at, we\u2019ll probably get pulled over for a ticket. Then what will you tell them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat my fianc\u00e9e is kinky, and she gets her sexual kicks from me driving her around blindfolded. Then, and only then, will she let me fuck her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJake!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat, or we\u2019re into BDSM, and you\u2019re my submissive. And seeing you like this is how I get my kicks.\u201d I feel his hand go to my leg, his rough fingertips gently stroking the skin just above my knee.</p><p>This is the first time in five days that he\u2019s touched me intimately. My pulse jumps and my whole body responds.</p><p>\u201cDo you realise how hard my dick is right now, just looking at you sitting there in those fuck-hot boots, that short skirt...blindfolded.\u201d</p> <p>Holy fuck.</p><p>\u201cAnd what do you plan on doing with it?\u201d My voice has taken on a husky tone all its own.</p><p>\u201cSomething which will mean you being naked very soon, wearing only that scarf over your eyes and those come-fuck-me-now boots wrapped around my waist.\u201d</p><p>Sweet baby Jesus.</p><p>I wonder if he\u2019s taking us to a hotel for sex.</p><p>My insides pool at the thought of Jake naked and inside me. I have to suppress a moan.</p><p>His hand leaves my leg, and I hear the indicator tick-tocking a turn. Then he stops the car, lowers his window, and talks to someone. A man.</p><p>I\u2019m blindfolded here, and Jake is talking to some guy.</p><p>Where the hell is he taking me?</p><p>\u201cGood to see you again, Mr. Wethers. I\u2019ll open the gate for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>I hear Jake\u2019s window close, and he starts to move the car slowly forward.</p><p>A thought thuds into my head.</p><p>Oh my God, what if he\u2019s taking me to some kinky sex club?</p><p>He was just talking about BDSM, and he did say I\u2019ll be naked soon, wearing only this scarf and these boots.</p><p>Oh, holy fucking mother of God.</p><p>I\u2019m not into that kind of stuff. I\u2019m a straight-up-sex type of girl. A little dirty talk, sure. Maybe Jake tying me up...I\u2019d happily give that a try. But not outright kinky stuff.</p><p>I didn\u2019t think he was either, to be honest. I know he\u2019s a little dominant in the bedroom, which is really sexy, but I didn\u2019t think whips and chains were his kind of thing.</p><p>Maybe this is just another thing I didn\u2019t know about him.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d My voice comes out small.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll know in about two minutes. Think you can hold on that bit longer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you taking me to a sex club?\u201d I blurt out.</p><p>I hear choked laughter. \u201cDo you want me to be taking you to a sex club?\u201d I can feel his body shaking next to me.</p><p>\u201cGod, no!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, because I\u2019m not into sharing you with anyone.\u201d He takes hold of my hand, sweeping a kiss across my knuckles. \u201cI\u2019ve already told you, Tru, you\u2019re mine, and mine alone.\u201d</p><p>Jake stops the car and turns off the engine.</p><p>Releasing my hand, he says, \u201cWait there, I\u2019ll help you out of the car.\u201d</p><p>Doing as he asks, I wait until Jake gets out of the car, then opens my door.</p><p>Taking hold of my hands, he guides me out. With his arm around me, he walks with me. \u201cOkay, stand right there,\u201d he says, positioning me in place. \u201cYou ready?\u201d I can feel his warm breath on my face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m actually not. I\u2019m really shitting it now as to what I\u2019m going to be revealed to.</p><p>I hate surprises. Why does he insist on surprising me all the bloody time?</p><p>God, what if I don\u2019t like whatever it is he wants me to see?</p><p>Crap.</p><p>Jake\u2019s hands reach around to the back of my head, and he unties the knot holding the scarf in place.</p><p>Loosening it from my eyes, Jake removes the scarf and stands aside.</p><p>Blinking rapidly, I let my eyes readjust to the bright sun.</p><p>Then I see a house.</p><p>A huge house, situated about fifty feet before me.</p><p>It\u2019s single-story. Concrete, stucco, and wood\u2014the combination is incredibly striking. It\u2019s modern and stunning, and it\u2019s instant love.</p><p>If I could marry a house, this would be the house I would marry and have minihouse babies with.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d I ask, pulling my eyes from the house to Jake.</p><p>I find his eyes already on me. Nervous eyes. \u201cA house.\u201d He smiles tentatively. \u201cOur house if you want it.\u201d</p><p>I turn from the house to face him. \u201cYou bought a house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bought us a house. I put an offer in and they accepted. But if you don\u2019t like it, I can pull out and we can find something else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I glance back at the house. \u201cIt\u2019s just...\u201d</p><p>\u201cTru, if you don\u2019t like it, honestly, it\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love it.\u201d I look back to him. \u201cReally love it. Well, what I\u2019ve seen so far, but if the outside is anything to go by, then...wow. Seriously, wow. But...it\u2019s just...I imagine it wasn\u2019t cheap.\u201d I smile, uneasily. It feels clumsy and awkward on my lips.</p><p>Couples buy houses together, share the mortgage. Jake buys a house outright. A house that I\u2019m guessing cost millions of dollars.</p><p>One that I have no chance of being able to contribute toward.</p><p>\u201cCall it birthday present number five.\u201d</p><p>I let out a high-pitched laugh. Since we came back into each other\u2019s lives, Jake has been buying me special gifts to make up for the missed birthdays in the twelve years we were apart. \u201cThis is a little extravagant for a birthday gift, even for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can call it two birthday gifts in one if you want.\u201d He moves closer and tucks my hair behind my ear.</p><p>\u201cMore like a hundred in one. Wow, Jake. I\u2019m just...speechless. Seriously bloody speechless. I just wish I had something to contribute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d He frowns.</p><p>Looking down, I scuff the toe of my boot against the concrete. \u201cWell...you know, normal people get a mortgage together, pay half each for the house. That kind of contribution.\u201d</p><p>Lifting my chin, he says softly, \u201cWe\u2019re not most people, Tru. I told you when we were on the island that I want you to have the best of everything. This house is part of that. I want us to have a home together.\u201d</p><p>I know why he\u2019s bought this house. Because of how I feel about his place. Jake has shopped for a new house and spent an inordinate amount of money, all because of me. As if he hasn\u2019t got enough to deal with at the moment.</p><p>I\u2019m such a selfish bitch.</p><p>\u201cJake...I\u2019m sorry.\u201d I drop my gaze. \u201cI know why you bought this house. And I didn\u2019t mean for you to sell your home and buy a brand-new house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at me.\u201d His tone is firm, causing my eyes to lift to his. \u201cYou have nothing to be sorry for. And I had a house, Tru. It was never a home. You\u2019re my home. I want you happy. And you\u2019re not happy at my place, and honestly, I don\u2019t fuckin\u2019 blame you. Christ, if it was me, I\u2019d have been climbing the goddamn walls if I had to live permanently in a house that you\u2019d shared with\u2014\u201d He cuts off. He doesn\u2019t say his name; he doesn\u2019t have to. I know he means Will.</p><p>Will, the man whose heart I broke when I had an affair with Jake. Will, whom I left so I could be with Jake. But it still didn\u2019t stop me ping-ponging between the both of them in the beginning. I hate so much that I did that.</p><p>And I hate the pain it still brings to Jake\u2019s eyes. It\u2019s like a blow to the gut. A reminder of how badly I handled everything. How much I hurt him.</p><p>\u201cYou bought us a brand-new house so you could have sex with me again?\u201d I smile, trying to ease the atmosphere. \u201cYou do realise getting us a hotel room would have been much cheaper.\u201d</p><p>He runs his finger down my cheek. \u201cSweetheart, I would give everything I own to be able to fuck you again.\u201d He returns my smile with his sexy grin, and I know I have him back to good.</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s one hell of a shag-pad-to-be.\u201d I tilt my head in the direction of the house.</p><p>\u201cTru.\u201d He grabs my face, trapping it between his hands. \u201cI want to make love to you in every single room in that house. But it\u2019s not just that. I want a fresh start for the both of us. This place is brand-new. It was completed a few months back. No one has lived in it before. It\u2019s ours to fill with memories.\u201d</p><p>Tears well in my eyes, and one escapes, running down my cheek, trickling onto Jake\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re crying\u2014good or bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d I reply as he wipes the wet away. \u201cReally, really good.\u201d</p><p>Jake smiles, and it\u2019s so beautiful it makes my heart ache.</p><p>I wrap my arms around his neck and reach up on my tiptoes to meet his face. I kiss him gently on the lips.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d I whisper over his mouth.</p><p>\u201cI love you too, baby. Now come on,\u201d he says, releasing me, sounding suddenly excited. \u201cLet me give you the tour.\u201d</p><p>Jake opens the huge wooden front door to reveal an open-plan living room with high ceilings. Across from me are floor-to-ceiling windows that span the whole of the back wall, offering a panoramic view of LA. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Holy fuck, it\u2019s breathtaking.</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d I whisper, walking farther in, my eyes glued to the view.</p><p>\u201cWhat do think?\u201d Jake asks beside me.</p><p>Closing my mouth in attempt to form words, I utter, \u201cIt\u2019s stunning.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe view is spectacular at night,\u201d Jake says, moving through the living room toward the window.</p><p>I follow him, dazed, trying desperately to take in my surroundings. It\u2019s decorated throughout, finished with two huge light grey sofas, a glass table, and modern art hanging on the walls. There\u2019s also an open fireplace\u2014one of those trendy ones with the artificial flames.</p><p>\u201cThe furniture is just for show,\u201d Jake says, as if reading my mind. \u201cYou can decorate however you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHowever we want,\u201d I correct.</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d He smiles.</p> <p>\u201cThis is one of the best features in this place.\u201d I watch with interest as Jake flips open a little panel on the wall beside the glass. He presses a button and the huge glass wall starts to slide open, disappearing into the far wall, opening the living room onto the patio.</p><p>My jaw drops.</p><p>\u201cHoly fuck,\u201d I whisper, stepping through. \u201cThat\u2019s awesome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, right?\u201d Jake\u2019s grinning like a boy with a new toy.</p><p>I glance over the huge plush patio area, my eyes locking on the swimming pool. It\u2019s massive. The size of the ones you find at the local swimming baths, but way, way nicer.</p><p>I move closer and discover it\u2019s an infinity-edge pool.</p> <p>Moving from the pool, I approach the seating area, which is decked out with an L-shaped wicker sofa, padded with thick white cushions and centred around a gorgeous fire pit.</p><p>I glance out again at LA. \u201cWhereabouts are we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the hills.\u201d</p><p>My eyes nearly pop out of my head. \u201cHollywood Hills?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe very ones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoly fuck.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t stop saying holy fuck. But really, this is a \u201choly fuck\u201d moment in my life if ever there was one.</p><p>I\u2019m in a house in the Hollywood Hills. A ginormous house that Jake wants to buy for us.</p> <p>I may just have a panic attack. Or faint. Or maybe both.</p><p>Fucking fuckety fuck.</p><p>I don\u2019t know much about property prices, but I\u2019m figuring this one costs a lot more than Jake\u2019s place in Pacific Palisades.</p><p>I wonder who the neighbours are.</p><p>\u201cHow much is this place going for?\u201d</p><p>Jake leans back against the seating area. He eyes me carefully for a long moment before answering. \u201cThirty.\u201d</p><p>I have to steady myself on the table, as I\u2019m guessing he doesn\u2019t mean thirty thousand.</p><p>\u201cThirty million dollars!\u201d My voice has reached maximum pitch. I\u2019m expecting to hear glass shatter any moment now.</p><p>I know Jake has a lot of money, but holy fuck.</p><p>Holy fuckety fuck!</p><p>\u201cI know it seems like a lot...okay, it is a lot,\u201d he adds at my pained expression. \u201cBut it\u2019s not like I can\u2019t afford it. And I don\u2019t plan on us moving again. I wanted the best place for us, equipped with everything we need for now and for the future. This place is as good as they come.\u201d</p><p>Future. Kids? Kids he doesn\u2019t want.</p><p>Swallowing down on that heart-wrenching thought, I ask, \u201cHow many bedrooms?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive! Jesus Christ, Jake! There should be at least fifty for that price!\u201d</p><p>Snuffling a laugh, he comes over to me and wraps his arms around my waist, pulling me close.</p><p>\u201cBaby, there\u2019s plenty enough here for the price, trust me. It\u2019s a gated community. The house itself is surrounded with gates, and that guy you heard before, he\u2019s the security for the house. It\u2019s manned twenty-four hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo keep your legions of female fans out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was thinking more about keeping the legions of admiring men away from my girl.\u201d He squeezes me tight. \u201cIt\u2019s a great place, baby. A great neighbourhood. It\u2019s got a huge garden,\u201d he says, nodding to the right. \u201cThere\u2019s a two-bed guesthouse in the garden, which is where Stuart will live.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStuart\u2019s not going to live with us anymore?\u201d I pout.</p><p>\u201cWell, we talked, baby, and we decided it was time he move out and get his own place. He\u2019s all grown up, ready to face the world. We have to let him go sometime. We can\u2019t keep him forever.\u201d Jake gives me a grave look, clearly taking the piss.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an idiot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTakes one to know one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat it does.\u201d I smile warmly.</p><p>He rubs his nose against mine, Eskimo-style. \u201cI just thought it would be good to have our privacy, and Stuart gets his too. Also, I no longer have to run the risk of catching him making out with a dude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou love it really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Catching Stuart making out with a guy?\u201d</p><p>Pressing my lips together, suppressing a smile, I nod.</p><p>\u201cSweetheart, nothing could kill my hard-on quicker, believe me. I like the person I\u2019m with to be soft and warm.\u201d He runs his fingertips down my bare arm. \u201cI want her made to fit around me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike me?\u201d I scratch my fingernails over the denim covering his pert behind.</p><p>\u201cExactly like you.\u201d</p><p>Jake bends his head down to mine and kisses me softly.</p><p>\u201cWill you miss him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre we still talking about Stuart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just worried he\u2019ll think my being here is pushing him out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweetheart, he works for me, and it\u2019s not like he\u2019s going far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know he works for you, but he\u2019s your friend too. You guys have lived together for such a long time. You\u2019re like Joey and Chandler. Except you\u2019d probably have been Joey, and Chandler was never gay. Oh God, would that make me Monica or Rachel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck are you talking about?\u201d He laughs.</p><p>\u201cFriends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna have to watch this show, aren\u2019t I, just so I can figure out what the fuck you\u2019re talking about half the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Pervy Perverson, you are. Honestly, I have no clue how you haven\u2019t. I\u2019ll buy the first season on Blu-ray and we can watch it together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSarcasm doesn\u2019t suit you, Wethers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but you wrapped around me does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLater,\u201d I say, pushing back from him, grinning. \u201cBecause right now you have the rest of this place to show me.\u201d</p><p>Half an hour later, the tour of my new home is complete. Jake and I are back in the living room, looking out at LA.</p><p>I\u2019ve discovered this place has a gym, a cinema room, an office, a wine cellar, a library, and a games room. There\u2019s another guest section that has two rooms, which Jake said he\u2019ll turn into a studio like the one he has at his house. I also discovered this house has the biggest kitchen I have ever seen, complete with a separate utility room, a dining room, and of course the five bedrooms, complete with en suite bathrooms.</p><p>It\u2019s so big I actually fear getting lost in here. And I have no clue how the hell I\u2019m going to keep it clean. It\u2019ll be a full-time job in itself.</p><p>I\u2019ve decided that aside from the living room, my favourite room is the master bedroom. Obvious reasons aside, it has the same breathtaking view of LA as the living room, with the same floor-to-ceiling windows.</p><p>\u201cSo...do you want me to go ahead with the offer on this place?\u201d Jake asks from behind me, resting his face against the side of mine, his arms moving to tighten around my waist.</p><p>I have a vision of Jake and me standing here like this late at night, his arms wrapped around me, as we stare out at nighttime LA.</p><p>I feel such an intense wave of contentment that I know unequivocally that I want this house to be our home.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say, unable to keep the happiness from my voice. \u201cI absolutely want you to go ahead with the offer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank fuck,\u201d he says, his hand slipping inside my top to cup my breast, making me gasp at the contact I\u2019ve been so badly missing these last few days. \u201cSo can I make love to you now in our new home?\u201d His breath is hot against my ear.</p><p>Swallowing, I reply, \u201cYes,\u201d with a breathy moan.</p><p>Jake spins me around, and my mouth hits his at exactly the same time, with the same hungry need.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait,\u201d he growls. \u201cI need to be inside you now.\u201d</p><p>The urgency and command in his voice soaks my panties.</p><p>\u201cI thought you were gonna fuck me blindfolded and in my boots?\u201d I whisper across his lips.</p><p>He groans. \u201cNext time, because right now I just need to bury my cock deep inside you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere do you want me?\u201d</p><p>Jake\u2019s eyes hit the couch. My back does a second later. A few more seconds, and I\u2019m shirtless and skirtless, my panties torn off.</p><p>Jake has barely gotten his own pants off before he\u2019s thrusting his insatiable cock inside me.</p><p>\u201cEager much?\u201d I breathe, lifting my hips.</p><p>\u201cToo fucking right I am. Jesus Christ, Tru, I am never going that long without being inside you again.\u201d</p><p>I know it\u2019s a stupid thing to ask, but I still have to, because this is me. \u201cWhy haven\u2019t you been near me?\u201d I ask quietly.</p><p>He pauses, staring down at me, a look of confusion on his face. \u201cI was trying to be respectful. I knew how you felt about my house.\u201d</p><p>I nod, feeling relieved that was his reason why and loving him so much more for it.</p><p>\u201cIt was really damn hard keeping my hands off you, you know. Why do you think I bought this house so quickly?\u201d</p><p>The grin he wears makes me giggle and brings me back to the now and the feel of him inside me.</p><p>Taking hold of my hips, he kneels, lifting my lower half with him, giving him the access he wants to get deeper inside me.</p><p>\u201cAt least I got to wear the boots.\u201d I tap the heels of my ankle boots against his back.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d he groans, rocking into me. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna be the death of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should stop. I don\u2019t want you dying on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo fuckin\u2019 way,\u201d he growls, burying himself deeper inside. \u201cYou\u2019re not going anywhere until we\u2019ve both come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay that again in Spanish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d his voice is strained.</p><p>\u201cS\u00ed, se\u00f1or,\u201d I whisper. \u201cNo me jodas, por favor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI fucking love you, Tru, so damned much.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m struck by the depth of his need for me, what I can do to him with my words alone, and the total control he takes over my body. And my heart. He owns me. It leaves me breathless.</p><p>\u201cTe quiero,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>He shudders, a deep sound escaping his throat. \u201cKeep talking Spanish to me, sweetheart,\u201d he groans, thrusting harder, in and out of me, chasing his need for orgasm, never forgetting mine as he presses his fingers against my bud and licks his cock against that sweet spot deep inside me.</p><p>Lost in him, wanting to please him, I whisper words of Spanish, heated praise I would never dare say in English, until my orgasm tears through me, pushing Jake over the edge. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I watch in awe as he throws his head back, the muscles in his neck tightening, straining, as he growls out his orgasm, pumping his hips hard into mine.</p><p>When he\u2019s done, he falls onto me. Brushing my hair from my face, he tenderly kisses my lips, then rests his head beside mine.</p><p>I turn my face to his. \u201cSo that\u2019s the living room christened. Only sixteen more rooms to go, excluding bathrooms, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m good for a few more rounds,\u201d he says, grinning. \u201cWhere next?\u201d</p> <p>CHAPTER FIVE</p><p>Today is moving day.</p><p>We\u2019re leaving Jake\u2019s old house behind; it\u2019s on the market now.</p><p>We\u2019ve been back in LA two weeks now, and I\u2019m really starting to like it here.</p><p>I still miss Simone and London like crazy, though. The one thing I miss most is our girls\u2019 night out on Friday nights.</p> <p>I\u2019m constantly surrounded by men here, so any girlie nights are pretty much out of the question.</p><p>I really do need to try and make some new girlfriends here. It\u2019s just not so easy to make new female friends when you\u2019re Jake Wethers\u2019s girlfriend.</p><p>Half the women here hate me because they want to sleep with Jake. The other half hate me because they have slept with him and they want round two.</p><p>I\u2019m currently not liked amongst my gender in LA. Well, worldwide, I\u2019d imagine, because I\u2019m the one who took Jake off the market.</p><p>So you see my problem.</p><p>Even though I miss London with all my heart, LA has one great perk: the clothes shops.</p> <p>Stuart\u2019s been giving me the guided tour of the best shops here. The man is a maniac when let loose around fabric, credit card in hand. Therefore, he encourages me to buy way too much. Stuart\u2019s a hard guy to say no to. Pretty much like Jake in that respect.</p><p>I\u2019m near to maxing out all my credit cards with my purchases. But they are all so completely worth it. Especially the new underwear I bought from Agent Provocateur, if only for the look on Jake\u2019s face when I modeled them last night.</p><p>My modeling debut ended up turning into a marathon lovemaking session. I cast aside my self-imposed sex ban at his house, knowing we were leaving.</p><p>I also put a no-ripping ban on the new underwear. After his initial disappointment, Jake removed them the old-fashioned way, quite slowly in fact. And there were certainly no complaints coming once he got in the rhythm.</p><p>Jake and I also spent time this past week furniture shopping. I\u2019ve loved every minute of it.</p><p>First item on the list: a new bed.</p><p>We bought a custom-made Parnian bed at Jake\u2019s insistence, which is being delivered today.</p><p>Don\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s beautiful and supercomfy, but I did initially suggest that we could get one equally as good from IKEA. I thought it was such a large amount of money to spend on a bed. I know money is no issue to Jake, but it\u2019s still taking a little time for me to get used to that fact. Jake\u2019s argument was that if he\u2019s going to spend most of his time in it, on his knees making me come, then he wanted the best bed money can buy. Got to love his crass. And really, what could I say to that?</p> <p>Between bouts of fun and crazy spending, and keeping on top of work, I\u2019ve started planning our wedding. Well, kind of. I bought some bridal magazines and looked at wedding dresses.</p><p>It\u2019s the best kind of start, if you ask me.</p><p>I still haven\u2019t yet decided whether we will get married here or back home in the UK. Mama is naturally pushing for the UK, but I\u2019m just not sure.</p><p>One thing Jake and I did do was decide on a date for the wedding.</p><p>I will become Mrs. Jake Wethers on 21 July 2013.</p><p>Trudy Wethers.</p><p>It\u2019s so weird. And I so can\u2019t bloody wait!</p><p>The reason we picked 21 July is because it\u2019s the date I went to interview Jake. We\u2019ll be married a year to the day we fell back into each other\u2019s lives. I still can\u2019t believe how much has happened in such a short time.</p><p>So I\u2019ve got a little over nine months to plan our wedding.</p><p>Plenty of time. I think. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve never planned a wedding before. To be honest, it kind of hurts my head when I think of the enormity of what I have to do.</p><p>Jake suggested I hire a wedding planner, but I don\u2019t know if I want a complete stranger organising my wedding. It feels like it\u2019s something I should do with the help of my mum and girlfriends.</p><p>Honestly, though, I have been secretly considering taking Jake up on his offer of Vegas.</p><p>The only thing stopping me is the fact that my mother would quite likely never speak to me again if I got married standing before a guy dressed as Elvis.</p><p>On the other big news front, Jake and Zane, who I\u2019m still yet to meet, discovered who was stealing from the label.</p><p>The A&amp;R director. No one I\u2019ve ever met. His name is Scott Speed.</p><p>Scott has worked for Jake pretty much from the beginning, like Zane.</p><p>Apparently Scott is a gambler, and he had run up some pretty big debts. He stole the money to pay the not-so-nice people he owed.</p><p>That was his excuse, anyway.</p><p>For me, there is no excuse for stealing.</p><p>I saw how what he\u2019s done has affected Jake, and that\u2019s what really pisses me off. I get that Scott may have been in a tight fix, but there are other ways out.</p><p>Jake even said that if Scott had just told him what was going on, he would have helped him pay off the debts and gotten him the help he needed with his addiction.</p><p>Jake above anyone knows what it\u2019s like to deal with an addiction.</p><p>The worst thing for Jake was that he had no choice but to report it to the police, and now Scott has been charged with fraud.</p><p>It\u2019s sad, but Jake\u2019s hands were tied. Scott had committed a serious crime, and if Jake hadn\u2019t reported it, he would have been in trouble himself.</p><p>One good thing is Jake has managed to keep it out of the news. The last thing the label needs right now is any negative press.</p><p>But that\u2019s all behind us now, and today we start our life together in our humongous new house.</p><p>Our $30 million humongous house in the Hollywood Hills.</p><p>I still cannot get over how much this house is worth. Or that I\u2019m going to be living in such an amazing house in Hollywood.</p><p>It\u2019s all still a little surreal.</p><p>Currently, I\u2019m standing outside my amazing house, in my surreal moment, feeling a little redundant.</p><p>The movers are shifting all our belongings into the house for us, and Stuart is at the helm directing. I currently have nothing to do and no clue where Jake is.</p><p>He was here a minute ago but vanished, leaving me here looking like a lemon.</p><p>Almost all of the stuff being moved in is Jake\u2019s. What little stuff I have, which Simone kindly boxed up for me, was shipped from London. It consists of clothes, shoes, makeup, accessories, handbags, and photos and mementos I\u2019ve collected over the years.</p><p>Not a lot, really. It makes me a little sad that I have so little to show for my life in London.</p><p>Making my way past one of the movers, through the front door and living room, I go out onto the patio area, where it\u2019s quiet.</p><p>Thankful I\u2019m wearing denim shorts, I kick my wedges off and sit down at the edge of the infinity pool and immerse my legs in the water as I stare out at the skyline.</p><p>Suddenly awash with homesickness, I decide to call Simone.</p><p>\u201cHey, gorgeous!\u201d comes her chipper voice down the line.</p><p>Hearing Simone\u2019s voice, and London in the background, causes my throat to thicken.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I say, forcing my voice out.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s moving day going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t sound very excited. I would be bouncing off the bloody walls if I were moving into that house!\u201d</p><p>I e-mailed Simone photos of the house last week, and she was, let\u2019s say...mega impressed to say the least. She screamed down the phone\u2014a lot.</p><p>\u201cMaybe Denny will buy you one,\u201d I say, deflecting the conversation from me to her and Denny.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019d be so bloody lucky!\u201d she laughs.</p><p>Denny is the drummer in TMS and one of Jake\u2019s closest friends. Simone and Denny met when I was on tour with the band. They\u2019ve been together ever since, and are managing to successfully maintain a long-distance relationship.</p><p>How long they\u2019ll stay long distance, I\u2019m not sure.</p><p>I can\u2019t see Simone giving up her job and coming over here anytime soon, even though for purely selfish reasons I wish she would. And Denny has commitments here with the band.</p><p>\u201cI wish you lived here so we could see each other every day like we used to,\u201d I murmur.</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why don\u2019t you just move here?\u201d I say. \u201cMove in with Denny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTru, for starters, I don\u2019t even know if Denny would want to live with me. He\u2019s never mentioned it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet he would. He\u2019s crazy about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she sighs. \u201cBut I also love my job too, you know. I\u2019m doing so well at work right now that I\u2019d be crazy to throw it all away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess,\u201d I sigh.</p><p>Unlike me, who moves halfway around the world to be with the man she loves. But then, that man is Jake. The person I have loved for my whole life. And I guess I didn\u2019t have to give up my job either. I\u2019m lucky enough to have the best boss in the world, who\u2019s letting me work transatlantic. Thank God for Vicky\u2014and technology.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, why are you on the phone with me in the midst of your move? It is still happening, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs we speak. I\u2019m just...not needed. The movers are putting everything away, and Stuart is making sure everything runs smoothly, which I don\u2019t mind, because it\u2019s his job to do that kind of stuff. I guess I just...\u201d I let out another sigh, kicking my leg against the blue. \u201cIgnore me, I\u2019m just being silly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot how us normal folk move, eh, babe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d I love how I don\u2019t have to say the actual words to Simone. She just gets me every time.</p><p>\u201cYou remember when we moved into the flat?\u201d I say, the memory tickling me. \u201cJust me and you, lugging furniture and boxes in. And oh my God! That bloody van we hired that kept breaking down!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSodding thing kept cutting out when I was driving it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd on our first night in the flat we ate Indian takeaway straight from the containers, using plastic forks, and drank the wine straight from the bottle because we couldn\u2019t be arsed to unpack any plates or glasses!\u201d I\u2019m really laughing now.</p><p>\u201cGod, we used to have such a laugh!\u201d Simone crows, sounding a little breathless.</p><p>\u201cA lot\u2019s changed since then,\u201d I muse, my laughter quickly dying as I stare into the water.</p><p>\u201cFor the better,\u201d she says. But it actually sounds like a question.</p><p>She loves Jake, but he is who he is, and he has the problems he has. I know Simone worries for me.</p><p>\u201cDefinitely for the better.\u201d I smile, the thought of Jake instantly bringing it to my lips.</p><p>I hear movement behind me. Turning, I see Jake making his way toward me.</p><p>\u201cMy absent fianc\u00e9 has just reappeared,\u201d I say to Simone. \u201cI\u2019ll call you later, once we\u2019re all settled, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, honey, speak to you later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSimone?\u201d Jake asks, sitting on the edge of one of the chairs. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d I nod, pushing my phone back into the pocket of my shorts.</p><p>\u201cWhat you doing out here alone?\u201d he asks.</p><p>Looking away, I shrug. \u201cJust taking in the scenery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is beautiful.\u201d</p> <p>When I turn back to him, I find his eyes on me.</p><p>\u201cCome with me,\u201d he says, standing. \u201cI\u2019ve got something I want to show you.\u201d</p><p>Jake pushes open the door to the library and leads me through.</p><p>In the centre of the room I see a piano. A stunningly beautiful black piano.</p><p>\u201cIs that a B\u00f6sendorfer?\u201d I ask, taking a tentative step toward it.</p> <p>Owning a B\u00f6sendorfer was my ultimate dream when I used to play. Jake knew that.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a 290 Imperial,\u201d he says softly from behind me.</p><p>\u201cWow, it\u2019s beautiful.\u201d I run my fingertips over the casing.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s yours.\u201d</p><p>I step back, away from the piano.</p><p>\u201cI thought you could start playing again.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo...I, um...\u201d I shake my head. \u201cI haven\u2019t played in a really long time, Jake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour dad said you stopped playing right after I left.\u201d</p><p>He did?</p><p>\u201cMy dad talks too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, Tru?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dunno.\u201d I shrug. \u201cHe just does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Jake smiles, coming over to me. \u201cNot why does your dad talk too much. Why did you stop playing after I left?\u201d</p><p>I feel a flood of emotion rush through me, all that bottled-up pain I\u2019ve carried around for all these years hitting the surface, causing my skin to prickle and my mouth to work of its own accord.</p> <p>\u201cBecause your leaving broke my heart, Jake, and when you cut off all contact, what was left of my heart shattered. Music was always our thing, and it just hurt too much to play without you. And then one day, not long after you were gone, I just couldn\u2019t bring myself to touch the keys. When you left...I guess the music left with you.\u201d</p><p>Jake wraps his arms around me, crushing me to his chest. \u201cFuck, Tru,\u201d he chokes out. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry I left you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were fourteen, it\u2019s not like you could have stayed.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m seriously fighting back tears here. One wrong word from him, and I\u2019m envisioning a teenage-style sobbing session.</p><p>\u201cNo, but I could have kept in touch. I should have kept in touch. I was such a stupid, selfish fucker back then, so fucking angry, and I couldn\u2019t see past my own pain at losing you. I never thought how cutting you off would affect you. I should have come back to you the moment I turned old enough to leave home, and all those years since.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you had, then the world would have missed out on the Mighty Storm. Everything happens for a reason, Jake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just wish that reason hadn\u2019t meant twelve years without you. I fuckin\u2019 hate that you stopped playing the piano because of me. I want you to have this back, Tru. I want you to start playing again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I shake my head, moving from his tight embrace. \u201cIt\u2019s been so long since I last played, I might have forgotten how.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t forget. You\u2019ll be rusty, but it\u2019ll still be there. You are an amazing player, Tru. Natural talent like yours doesn\u2019t just disappear.\u201d</p><p>I gaze up at his face.</p><p>\u201cTry, for me? Please.\u201d</p><p>How can I say no to him? Especially when he\u2019s giving me the puppy-dog eyes.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I concede.</p><p>The smile he gives me nearly cracks me wide open.</p><p>I take the seat at the piano and let my rusty fingers hover over the keys.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to play,\u201d I say, feeling self-conscious, pulling back my hands.</p><p>\u201cI bought you some sheet music,\u201d Jake says, retrieving some music books off a shelf. \u201cYou know, just in case you needed them,\u201d he adds, handing the books to me.</p><p>\u201cAny of yours in here?\u201d I tilt my head toward the books.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He grins, leaning against the piano. \u201cI made sure they were clean before I bought them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I wanted to play one of yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll teach you. First, play me something from one of these.\u201d</p><p>I sift through the books and opt for the modern music one.</p><p>Opening up the pages, I flick through to the first song and almost laugh. My Adele ringtone.</p><p>I wonder if he knew that was in here.</p><p>Setting the book up on the piano, I read over the music, refreshing my memory with the notes. I surprise myself at how easily I can read the music.</p><p>Jake was right when he said I wouldn\u2019t have forgotten.</p><p>I position my left hand over the keys, reading to play a C minor for four beats, then G minor with my right for two beats, then shifting to B-flat and G minor.</p><p>Okay, deep breath...here we go.</p><p>Crap, I\u2019m playing and...it feels surprisingly good. Great, in fact.</p><p>I close my eyes briefly, just feeling the keys beneath my fingers, and in that brief moment, Jake starts to sing quietly along, and I\u2019m transported back to a whole other time and place.</p><p>Opening my eyes, I see him smiling at me. He\u2019s wearing the kind of happiness I haven\u2019t seen on his face for twelve long years. Seeing him looking at me this way makes me fall into the music even more, and then it\u2019s like I never stopped playing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to have a bath,\u201d I holler down the long hall to Jake, who is in the living room.</p><p>\u201cYou want some dinner ready when you\u2019re done?\u201d comes back his reply.</p><p>\u201cYou gonna cook?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll order in, smart-ass.\u201d</p><p>Holding back a laugh, I reply, \u201cThen, yes, please.\u201d</p><p>I head into our bedroom, then the en suite, and turn the taps on our new, never-before-used bathtub.</p><p>Searching through the cupboard where all my toiletries have been stored, I find my bubble bath and pour some under the running water.</p><p>The movers finished a few hours ago and have long since left.</p><p>Stuart\u2019s in his new abode, getting himself set up. So it\u2019s just Jake and me in the house together, all alone.</p><p>Being alone with Jake is a big thing for me, as it doesn\u2019t happen often. Now that we\u2019re living together, though, just him and me, T&amp;J alone time is going to happen often.</p><p>The thought sends a thrill through me.</p><p>Turning the taps off, I set the music system in the bathroom, selecting the new Killers album. I\u2019m currently having a love affair with it, especially the song \u201cMiss Atomic Bomb.\u201d I pull my clothes off, dropping them into the hamper; tie my hair into a loose knot; then submerge my body in the bath.</p><p>The scent and heat envelop me.</p><p>Heaven.</p><p>I close my eyes and rest my head back.</p><p>I wake with a start. Glancing at the clock, I see I\u2019ve been asleep for just over half an hour. Figuring dinner will be here by now\u2014and I\u2019m more than ready to eat, according to my rumbling tummy\u2014I let the water drain and climb out of the bath.</p><p>Wrapping a fluffy bath towel around myself, I turn off the music and go into the bedroom to change.</p><p>I put on my favourite pair of comfy jogging bottoms and my TMS T-shirt that I got from the European leg of the tour.</p><p>Making my way down the hall, I hear music. Jake\u2019s listening to our song, \u201cYou Started.\u201d</p><p>I turn into the living room and find him waiting for me.</p><p>He smiles, getting to his feet. I glance at the scene around him.</p><p>My skin tingles. The sensation vibrates through to my heart.</p><p>Set out on the coffee table are open cartons of Indian takeaway food. No plates or cutlery, just plastic forks. A bottle of white wine is open and waiting. No wineglasses.</p><p>Scattered all around the room are empty cardboard boxes.</p><p>\u201cDid I get it right?\u201d he asks, tilting his head to the side.</p><p>\u201cYou heard what I said to Simone?\u201d</p><p>He shrugs. \u201cI know things in my life are a little different from what you\u2019re used to. I thought because you didn\u2019t get a normal moving day, I would give you a normal first night in our new home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the boxes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor effect.\u201d He smiles, and his eyes sparkle under the lighting. \u201cThey work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou hungry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery.\u201d</p><p>But now I\u2019m not so hungry for the food, just hungry for him.</p><p>\u201cYou wanna try that new bed out?\u201d I suggest.</p><p>\u201cAbso-fucking-lutely.\u201d</p><p>The next thing I know, Jake\u2019s body is slamming into mine, picking me up, carrying me down the hall to our bedroom.</p><p>He lays me down on the bed, hovering over me, propped up on his hands.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d I whisper to him, in the dark. \u201cThank you for what you did out there. And for the piano. Thank you for all the wonderful things you do for me.\u201d</p><p>He stills for a long moment, staring down at me, a blank expression wearing his face. I wonder what\u2019s going through his mind.</p><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t anything I won\u2019t do for you, Tru. Nothing I won\u2019t do to make you happy. What I feel for you...it\u2019s limitless. There is nothing before or after you. There is only you.\u201d</p><p>I choke up with emotion.</p><p>I lift my hand to his face, tracing my finger over his cheek. \u201cWhen we get married, say that to me as your vow.\u201d</p><p>He nods, and leaning down, he presses a light kiss to my lips.</p><p>A sigh escapes him. \u201cI know I\u2019m not the best choice for you.\u201d His words move over my lips. \u201cI know I fuck up a lot, but I promise I will do everything in my power to make you happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou already make me happy all the time. Are you happy?\u201d</p><p>Lifting his head, his dark eyes stare at me. \u201cLike I never knew possible.\u201d</p><p>Then he closes his eyes, almost as if he\u2019s in pain. Like at some level, it\u2019s actually painful what he feels for me. I understand that, because I feel it too.</p><p>\u201cJake?\u201d</p><p>His eyes open to meet mine.</p><p>\u201cMake love to me?\u201d</p><p>Fulfilling my request, he does just that. Making love to me like tonight is the start. Like Jake and I have finally started.</p><p>CHAPTER SIX</p><p>I\u2019m at the point of banging my head against my laptop screen when Adele starts singing to me.</p><p>Glancing down I see Jake\u2019s name flashing. The smile it brings to my lips stays there as I answer it. \u201cHey, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot good. You\u2019re incredibly hard to write about, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut incredibly easy to love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yeah, but that\u2019s only because you have a big willy,\u201d I joke.</p><p>\u201cCock, baby. Call it cock, or dick. I\u2019ll even swing for snake. But not willy. Willy just sounds so wrong, on so many levels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo it doesn\u2019t! It\u2019s a British term. Have you forgotten those altogether?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but that\u2019s one I will gladly forget.\u201d</p><p>I hear voices in the background.</p><p>\u201cAre you with someone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in the studio with the guys. Zane\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just said \u2018cock,\u2019 \u2018dick,\u2019 and \u2018willy\u2019 in front of them.\u201d I groan.</p><p>He lets out a loud laugh. \u201cThey\u2019ve heard me say worse, baby, trust me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHmm,\u201d I murmur, cheeks flaming. Jake may have no problem talking sex in front of his friends, but I do.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, I was just calling because Zane has managed to fix up a spot for Vintage supporting Raine tonight. Their support pulled out on them last minute. I wondered if you fancied going to watch them?\u201d</p><p>Raine is a hugely successful indie band in LA with a massive local following. Vintage is the band who supported TMS at Madison Square Garden, the ones who won the radio contest. I really love their sound, and I mentioned to Jake that I thought they definitely had something. He listened to some of their stuff\u2014he hadn\u2019t been paying attention at the show for many reasons\u2014and liked what he heard, so he sent Zane to New York to check them out while we were on holiday.</p><p>Zane loved them and offered them a deal on the spot. They are now signed to the label and are in LA recording their first album.</p> <p>I like the fact that I pointed out their potential to Jake, and he listened to me. I love that he cares about my opinions on these things.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re asking if I want to watch a live band I encouraged you to sign? Hmm, let me think...\u201d</p><p>\u201cPick you up at seven?\u201d he says, chuckling.</p><p>\u201cAre you not coming home first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we\u2019ve got a good flow going at the moment, getting some new stuff down. I\u2019ll shower and change at the studio, and then I\u2019ll come by and pick you up.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThinking on it, why don\u2019t I just ask Dave to bring me to the show, and I\u2019ll meet you there. He\u2019ll be coming anyway, won\u2019t he? So it just makes sense.\u201d</p><p>Even though things aren\u2019t as \u201cfollow Jake around\u201d crazy fanwise in LA, he still has Dave or Ben with us when we go out. I get the feeling they\u2019re around more for me than him, though. I think he worries about my safety.</p><p>\u201cYeah, okay, good idea,\u201d he agrees.</p><p>Jake tells me where the show is, so I jot the address down and hang up. I stare at my computer screen for a few more minutes, then close it with a sigh. I head into my dressing room area to figure out what to wear tonight.</p><p>I\u2019m seated in the back of the car and Dave is driving us to the venue. The show is at some hip club in downtown LA.</p><p>Getting my mirror out of my clutch, I check my hair and makeup. I opted for hair down and curly, dark smoky eyes, and pink lip gloss. I thought the makeup should match the outfit. I\u2019m wearing my new black knee-length stretch-leather skirt and white off-the-shoulder sheer silk crepe top.</p> <p>As the top is sheer, I avoided wearing any of my new lacy bras, instead going with my white bra with gentle detail on it, which covers all the important bits. On my feet I\u2019m wearing my new Christian Louboutin peep-toe studded black heels. They are sexy as hell. I know Jake will totally approve of them.</p><p>Dave pulls the car around the back of the venue, into the reserved parking area. I see Jake\u2019s Aston Martin.</p><p>I climb out of the car and follow Dave to the metal door, leading into the back entrance of the club. He bangs his fist on it a couple of times.</p><p>A burly guy opens the door and greats Dave like they know each other well.</p><p>Dave gestures me through the door first, then I wait to follow him.</p><p>He leads me down a corridor, through a door, then another, and then we\u2019re in the club.</p><p>Looking to the left I see people setting up the stage, preparing for Vintage, who are due to play their set in just under an hour. There\u2019s music playing provided by the resident DJ, and people are on the dance floor already.</p><p>I spot Jake standing at the bar, drinking a bottle of beer, looking his ever-gorgeous self, wearing his blue Led Zeppelin \u201cSong Remains the Same\u201d T-shirt, slim-fitted bleached, ripped jeans, and black motorcycle boots.</p> <p>He looks as hot as hell. And he is all mine.</p><p>Ben\u2019s standing off to the side by the bar, with what looks to be a soft drink. Leaving me, Dave goes over to join him.</p><p>At the bar with Jake is a blond guy. A very good-looking blond guy. He looks to be about the same height as Jake, and he\u2019s wearing a white Oxford shirt, which he fills out with no problem, and gunmetal grey trousers. He screams urbane sophistication, the complete and utter contrast of Jake\u2019s bad-boy rock-star image.</p><p>Jake\u2019s face lights up at my approach. Then I see his eyes move down my body, and a frown mars his perfect face.</p><p>Oh no. He hates my outfit.</p><p>Feeling instantly self-conscious, tucking my clutch under my arm, I run my hands down my skirt and pick up my pace to him.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I say when I reach him.</p><p>He slides his hand around my waist. Pulling me close, he plants a kiss on my lips.</p><p>\u201cYou hate my outfit,\u201d I whisper under his mouth.</p><p>\u201cNo, I just hate that every man in this place can see your tits through it,\u201d he growls, kissing me one more time before releasing me.</p><p>Shit. I thought I looked nice. I guess not.</p><p>Turning to the man beside him, Jake says, \u201cTru, I\u2019d like you to meet Zane. He\u2019s the VP at the label. Zane, this is the future Mrs. Wethers.\u201d</p><p>Zane smiles. Smoldering chocolate-brown eyes meet mine. \u201cGreat to finally meet you, Tru.\u201d He offers his hand. \u201cI\u2019ve heard a lot about you.\u201d</p><p>Taking my hand, he lifts it to his lips and kisses it.</p><p>\u201cI hope he was saying mostly complimentary things,\u201d I say through my now-dry mouth, sliding a glance in Jake\u2019s direction.</p><p>\u201cAll complimentary.\u201d Zane smiles, releasing my hand. \u201cYou\u2019re just as beautiful as Jake described.\u201d</p><p>Just not in tonight\u2019s outfit, apparently.</p><p>Zane\u2019s smooth. Very smooth. But not in a slimy way. More in an \u201cI\u2019m well practiced at getting women into my bed and they leave very satisfied\u201d kind of way. The guy screams confidence and awesome sex. Just like Jake.</p><p>\u201cWhere the fuck have you been, ass-face?\u201d Jake says over my head.</p><p>Turning, I see Tom sauntering toward us.</p><p>\u201cNowhere. Hey, Tru,\u201d he says, turning his eyes toward me. \u201cNice top.\u201d His eyes flicker down to my chest, lingering longer than necessary.</p><p>\u201cStop staring at my fianc\u00e9e\u2019s tits,\u201d Jake growls.</p><p>Fuck. Thanks, Tom.</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m a guy...,\u201d he protests, \u201cand they\u2019re just there on display, what do expect me to do? Awesome rack, Tru, seriously awesome. I\u2019m real glad you decided to put them on show tonight. You really should show them off more often.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to break your face?\u201d Jake says, half joking.</p><p>At least I think he is.</p><p>Pulling my clutch up to cover my chest, I say, \u201cHaven\u2019t you got better things to be doing, Tom? Like finding your next doggie bag to take home, rather than staring at something you can never have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoh, harsh!\u201d Tom slaps his hand over his heart.</p><p>\u201cI like you more and more by the minute, Tru.\u201d Zane grins at me. \u201cWhat are you drinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get these,\u201d Jake says. \u201cYour usual, baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTom, you want a beer?\u201d</p><p>Tuning out the guys, I glance around the club. It\u2019s a nice place. A little grungy, but definitely somewhere I would have hung out back home.</p><p>I notice many eyes looking in our direction. Mostly at Jake. Well, all at Jake. Most of them don\u2019t even have the decency to look away when they see I\u2019ve caught them staring at my husband-to-be.</p><p>Nice.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I say as Jake hands me my margarita.</p><p>\u201cSo she blew you out?\u201d I catch Zane saying to Tom.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe fact you went back there to try your luck with her, and you\u2019re out here with us, definitely says she did, man,\u201d Jake says with a smile.</p><p>\u201cI never said I went to try my luck. I went to offer my support.\u201d</p><p>Jake laughs. \u201cThe only support you would have been offering her was up against a wall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d I say, taking a sip of my drink. \u201cTom got rejected by a woman?\u201d I give Tom a mock look of shock.</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d Jake replies, flashing wide eyes at me. \u201cHe tried to get into Lyla\u2019s pants, and being the smart girl she is, she blew him out like a candle.\u201d</p><p>Lyla is the ridiculously pretty lead singer of Vintage, and apparently, a very smart girl indeed.</p><p>\u201cShut up, fuck-face, she didn\u2019t blow me out. I would\u2019ve had to try something for that to happen. Not that it ever would. Women can\u2019t say no to the cat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow, man, in all the years I\u2019ve known you, you\u2019ve never had a girl say no to you,\u201d Jake says, ignoring Tom\u2019s defensiveness. \u201cWait \u2019til Denny hears this.\u201d Jake laughs. \u201cActually, I might ring him now.\u201d He reaches for his phone.</p><p>\u201cFor fuck\u2019s sake!\u201d Tom groans, grabbing his beer.</p><p>Zane pats him on the back, keeping a straight face. \u201cDon\u2019t sweat it, man, it happens to the best of us. Never to me, but I totally feel for you.\u201d Zane cracks up laughing.</p><p>\u201cI like Lyla,\u201d I pitch in. I\u2019ll get the twat back for the top comment before. \u201cShe seems like a great girl. Really attractive. Smart. Shame for you, Tom, being blown out like that.\u201d I smirk at him.</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ! The lot of you are doing my fuckin\u2019 head in! She was a nonstarter. I don\u2019t put the effort in for a woman. I don\u2019t need to. There are plenty more willing to step up to the plate.\u201d He nods in the direction of some open gawkers. \u201cOn that note, I\u2019ll catch you fuckers later. Tru,\u201d he says, eyes going straight to my chest, \u201ca pleasure as always. I hope to see you in that top again soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck off, Tom,\u201d Jake snaps.</p><p>Backing up, grinning, Tom winks at Jake and heads in the direction of the waiting girls.</p><p>Needing a reprieve, I ask Jake, \u201cWhere is the bathroom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThrough the archway.\u201d My eyes follow his pointing finger.</p><p>I put my drink on the bar, place a loving kiss on his lips, and head to the bathroom.</p><p>I\u2019ve just sat on the toilet to take a pee, when I hear them come into the bathroom, laughing and talking.</p><p>\u201cOh my God, did you see what she was wearing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. She looks like a hooker. A see-through top! And what about that skirt? I thought leather skirts went out with Pretty Woman.\u201d</p><p>I glance down at my leather skirt, which is currently sitting around my thighs, and my face starts to prickle.</p><p>\u201cShe is so totally batting out of her league with him. How the fuck did she ever manage to get a rock on her finger? I\u2019ll never know. Definitely not because of her dog-ugly face. Maybe she\u2019s got a magic vagina!\u201d She laughs loudly at her own joke.</p><p>I twist my engagement ring around my finger.</p><p>\u201cI heard they grew up together,\u201d the other girl says, \u201cand that he\u2019s apparently into her big-time. Always has been. She\u2019s the love of his life, and that\u2019s why he never settled down with anyone. Or so I heard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, whatever. This is Jake Wethers we\u2019re talking about. He might be tripping on the English bitch now, but give him a few more weeks, and she\u2019ll be gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. If Jake was going to settle down, it wouldn\u2019t be with someone like her.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou?\u201d The second one giggles.</p><p>\u201cHe kept coming back for more, didn\u2019t he? Told me I was the best fuck he\u2019d ever had. Coming from him, I took that as a big compliment. I bet he\u2019d still be good for a go now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think so? From what I hear he\u2019s playing the monogamous card nowadays. Never looks at any other women. He knocked Cherie Walters back the other day and was none too polite about it, from what I heard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, Jake never could say no to me. Especially when I was on my knees in his office, sucking him off.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m going to throw up.</p><p>\u201cI knew you were fucking him, but sucking him off in his office? Class!\u201d She laughs.</p><p>\u201cI turned up to see him one day at his office, wearing only my underwear under my trench, and I sucked his cock while he sat at his desk. Then he fucked me senseless over it.\u201d</p><p>Oh God. I close my eyes and put my head in my hands.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so bad.\u201d The other one giggles.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll go offer my services to him now if that British twinkie isn\u2019t around.\u201d I hear her slap her lips together and then the click of a purse closing. \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be up for a quickie in the back. If not, I might just pay him a visit at the label tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Heels click away from me; then I hear the door shut with a bang.</p><p>My whole body is shaking. My head prickling. Why didn\u2019t I just burst out there and make my presence known?</p><p>Now she\u2019s going to go out there and proposition Jake while I\u2019m here like an idiot with my panties around my ankles.</p><p>Hot tears sting my eyes.</p><p>Don\u2019t cry. Don\u2019t you dare bloody cry, Trudy Bennett, over a couple of nasty bitches.</p> <p>It\u2019s at times like this I wish Simone were here. I know she would have marched out there and slapped them stupid.</p><p>Normally I would have said something.</p><p>But I know why I didn\u2019t.</p><p>Because what could I say? Yes, Jake was a whore of the worst kind, but he\u2019s not like that anymore!</p><p>They\u2019d have laughed me out of here.</p><p>Honestly, part of me fears it\u2019s still in him. That one day soon, I won\u2019t be enough to keep him.</p><p>Forcing back the tears, my face burning with the shame of my cowardice, I finish on the toilet, wash my hands, straighten myself out, and head back into the club.</p><p>As I come from the archway, I spot Jake across the room still at the bar. Zane\u2019s nowhere to be seen, and Jake is now talking to a stunning blonde. Legs up to her neck, skirt there to meet them.</p> <p>Bile rises in my throat, alongside an intense shot of rage.</p><p>I\u2019m just about to march over there and give the blonde tramp a move-along speech, when I hear my name called from behind.</p><p>Turning, I see one of my old journo buddies from the circuit back in the UK, Jefferson Dunn. I\u2019d heard he had come to America to work for a magazine.</p><p>Even though I\u2019m pissed right now, a smile still crosses my face to see someone from back home.</p><p>\u201cJefferson!\u201d I beam.</p><p>\u201cTrudy Bennett,\u201d he says, smiling. \u201cLook at you. How the hell are you?\u201d He envelops me in a hug. I instantly get a whiff of strong alcohol on him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good. Great, actually, thanks. How are you?\u201d I say, stepping back from his embrace.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m great. All the better for seeing you. I heard you\u2019d moved out here\u2014with Jake Wethers, of all people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I lift my shoulders lightly, lips remaining in a smile.</p><p>I really don\u2019t want to talk about Jake right now.</p><p>\u201cWhere is the rock star?\u201d Jefferson asks, looking around. \u201cI\u2019d love to meet him.\u201d</p><p>Not wanting to point out Jake and the fact that he\u2019s at the bar with a leggy blonde\u2014especially to Jefferson, who\u2019s always on the tout for a story\u2014I say, \u201cOh, he\u2019s busy right now. Business, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure...you\u2019ll have to introduce me to him later.\u201d He takes a sip of his drink, which looks to be whiskey. \u201cWhat brings you here tonight?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cThe support act is signed to Jake\u2019s label. What about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWork. I\u2019m doing a piece on Raine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, cool.\u201d I shift on my feet, distracted.</p><p>I want to go over to Jake and the blonde, who, from what I can see in my glances over Jefferson\u2019s shoulder, is shamelessly flirting herself all over him, but I don\u2019t want to come off as rude to Jefferson.</p><p>\u201cIf Jake\u2019s busy with business right now, how about I keep you company until he\u2019s done? You want to dance?\u201d He tilts his head in the direction of the dance floor. I see his eyes flicker to my chest.</p><p>I\u2019m throwing this bloody top in the bin when I get home.</p><p>\u201cUm...\u201d</p><p>I really don\u2019t want to dance. I would actually quite like to go home, to be honest.</p><p>I sneak another glance over Jefferson\u2019s shoulder at Jake. Jake says something to the blonde, and she throws back her head and laughs, putting her hand on his chest.</p><p>I have a flashback to Paris and the redhead. The redhead Jake kissed in front of me, to get back at me for not breaking up with Will, after he\u2019d begged me to.</p><p>Jealousy sears through me like a red-hot poker. I grit my teeth.</p><p>\u201cYou know what? I would love to dance,\u201d I say to Jefferson through my teeth.</p><p>Screw Jake and his blonde...and all of his fucking conquests for that matter.</p><p>Pulling out the strap on my clutch, I hang it over my shoulder. Jefferson downs his drink, and, taking his offered hand, I let him lead me through the crowd to the centre of the dance floor.</p><p>We start off dancing separately, but it\u2019s not long before Jefferson moves in closer.</p><p>\u201cYou look great tonight,\u201d Jefferson says, leaning in to my ear. \u201cBut then, you always do.\u201d</p><p>I feel his arm go around my waist.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>I stiffen in his embrace.</p><p>Jake won\u2019t be happy if he sees this.</p><p>Isn\u2019t that the point?</p><p>\u201cThanks, you too.\u201d I pull away from him, but I feel his grip on my back tighten, holding me in place, and he starts to dance into me, grinding his hips near mine.</p><p>Ugh.</p><p>He\u2019s not even a good dancer.</p><p>Trying not to cringe at his awkward hip movements, I scrunch my eyes tightly, trying to figure a way out of this.</p><p>I\u2019m such a bloody idiot at times.</p><p>I\u2019m on the dance floor with Mr. Bean\u2019s version of Saturday Night Fever, in a lame attempt to make Jake jealous, while Jake is probably none the wiser and off screwing the blonde bitch in the back room, not even giving a toss about me.</p><p>Now I feel sick, and I just want to go get drunk and kick the crap out of Jake and his whore. I\u2019m just not sure in which order.</p><p>I\u2019m about to wriggle out of Jefferson\u2019s hold and make my excuses, when I feel him suddenly wrenched away from me.</p><p>My eyes shoot open to find a very angry-looking Jake staring down at me, and a very confused Jefferson trying to straighten out his shirt.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell!\u201d Jefferson says, then I see his face change to awe when he realises it\u2019s Jake who just pulled him off me.</p><p>\u201cI thought you were in the bathroom,\u201d Jake says to me, ignoring Jefferson. He sounds royally pissed off.</p><p>Standing tall, I say, \u201cI was. Then I decided to come and dance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you didn\u2019t think to come see me first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? I need to ask your permission to dance nowadays?\u201d I narrow my eyes at him. \u201cAnd anyway, you looked busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m never too busy for you. You should know that by now.\u201d There\u2019s no nice in his tone.</p><p>It\u2019s at this point Jefferson decides to pipe up.</p><p>\u201cI meant no disrespect,\u201d Jefferson says. \u201cI\u2019ve known Tru for ages. We knew each other back in London.\u201d</p><p>Jake stiffens. He turns to him and stares down the couple of inches to Jefferson\u2019s face. \u201cYou meant no disrespect, but you had your hands all over my girl?\u201d</p><p>Jefferson raises his hands in defence. \u201cWe were only dancing.\u201d But the smile on his face says something else entirely.</p><p>It makes my body stiffen.</p><p>Jake\u2019s face hardens. I worry for a second that he\u2019s going to do something stupid.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re leaving.\u201d Jake grabs my arm and starts to pull me away.</p><p>\u201cHey, man, take it easy,\u201d Jefferson puts his hand on Jake\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>I know instantly he\u2019s done the wrong thing.</p><p>Quick as lightning, Jake grabs Jefferson\u2019s arm, twisting it back and under, forcing Jefferson to bend under the strain. Then Jake shoves him away, all but tossing him across the dance floor.</p><p>The crowd quickly parts, people shifting out of the way, watching as Jefferson lands hard on the dance floor.</p><p>Dave and Ben are beside us in a flash. Ben is quick to get Jefferson off the floor and to his feet.</p><p>\u201cI was just dancing with her!\u201d Jefferson shouts, clearly not having learned when to stop talking. Then I see a near smile on his face. Like he\u2019s actually trying to antagonise Jake. \u201cShe\u2019s an old friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was a friend,\u201d Jake says, hard and cold, taking a step toward him. \u201cNot anymore. You keep your fuckin\u2019 hands off my girl, and if I ever see you near her again, you won\u2019t be getting up from the floor the next time.\u201d</p><p>A grin tilts Jefferson\u2019s lips. \u201cIs that a threat?\u201d</p><p>Jake\u2019s jaw clenches, and his fists ball at his sides. \u201cMore like a promise.\u201d</p><p>Dave stands between Jake and Jefferson, which I couldn\u2019t be more thankful for.</p><p>\u201cGo,\u201d Dave urges, pressing his hand against Jake\u2019s arm.</p><p>I start to back up, wanting out of here.</p><p>Jake takes a step back, moving with me, when Jefferson says loudly, \u201cCall me, Tru.\u201d</p><p>Jake moves so quickly, he\u2019s almost a blur. Luckily, Dave is faster and catches hold of Jake before he can do any damage. I\u2019ve seen what Jake can do when he loses it. And someone like Jake cannot be pummelling guys in clubs.</p><p>Especially journalists.</p><p>No longer wanting to be party to the scene I\u2019ve caused, I turn, and putting my head down, I start to move quickly, weaving through the crowd, heading for the exit.</p><p>Jake catches up with me near the door.</p><p>Grabbing my arm, he yanks me back, turning me to him. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d He sounds out of breath and angry.</p><p>\u201cHome,\u201d I state harshly. I\u2019m still pissed off with him for flirting with the blonde and for what I had to hear in the bathroom. And also for the scene he caused with Jefferson. I know I was wrong to dance with Jefferson for the reason I did, but he didn\u2019t have to react the way he did\u2014making a show of us.</p><p>I try to pull my arm from his hand, but there\u2019s no give.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is wrong with you?\u201d Jake states angrily in my face.</p><p>\u201cMe? What the hell is wrong with you? I was only dancing with him, for crying out loud!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDancing?\u201d He lets out a caustic laugh. \u201cIt looked like he was getting ready to fuck you right there and then on the dance floor. And you weren\u2019t exactly pushing him off either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScrew you, Jake! You can bloody talk with your whores scattered left, right, and centre, in my face all night! Then I\u2019m privy to the absolute displeasure of hearing a conversation about how one of your whores sucked you off in your office. Oh yeah, then you fucked her over your desk!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He looks confused.

Is she one of your office conquests too? Or did you just screw her at the house?\u201d</p><p>He looks confused again.</p><p>\u201cThe blonde at the bar I saw you flirting with! Have you shagged her too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t flirting with her. That\u2019s Dina. She works for me. She manages Vintage.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t answer my question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I have to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d I shout at him. I\u2019m past caring who hears me. \u201cI want to know if you\u2019ve fucked her too!\u201d</p><p>His eyes darken. \u201cNo, I haven\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust everyone else in LA, then.\u201d</p><p>He takes a step back, leaning against the wall. \u201cYou knew how I\u2019d lived my life when we got together, Tru. Don\u2019t act like this is a surprise now.\u201d He rubs his face hard. \u201cAre you ever going to be able to get past this?\u201d he asks. His voice is softer but serious.</p> <p>My anger wilts.</p><p>I wrap my arms around myself. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I shake my head, looking down. After a beat, I say, \u201cAnd if I can\u2019t, where does that leave us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight where we are but having to find some way for you to be able to cope with my past mistakes.\u201d</p><p>Moving away from the wall, he steps closer to me. \u201cI\u2019ve never given you any reason to doubt my faithfulness to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAside from the girl I found in your bed in Boston.\u201d</p><p>Shit.</p><p>I shouldn\u2019t have said that. But it\u2019s too late. I know I\u2019ve pushed the wrong button.</p><p>His face darkens, taking me back a step.</p> <p>\u201cOut of the two of us, I think I\u2019m the one with more cause for concern\u2014you didn\u2019t exactly have any trouble jumping straight from Will\u2019s bed into mine. So who\u2019s to say you won\u2019t do the exact same thing to me?\u201d</p><p>I feel like he\u2019s just slapped me. Hard. Repeatedly. Over and over.</p><p>My face burns. My eyes sting. I can\u2019t stop the tears leaking from them.</p><p>Without another word or look, I make for the exit.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d He takes hold of me from behind. Wrapping his arms tightly around me, his chest presses up against my back, and his lips are against my ear. I freeze in his hold.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I shouldn\u2019t have said that. I didn\u2019t mean it.\u201d He blows out a breath, and I feel it rush over me, momentarily heating my chilled skin. \u201cJust seeing you, dancing with him to that song, of all songs.\u201d</p><p>My ears instantly become alert to the song playing in the club coming to finish\u2014Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cSweet Dreams.\u201d The song Jake and I danced to in the club in Copenhagen. The night that was the start of us.</p><p>Did I subconsciously dance to this song on purpose to hurt him?</p><p>\u201cI want to go home,\u201d I say quietly. Shame and embarrassment course through me. And in this moment I\u2019m not really sure which home I\u2019m referring to.</p><p>His body stiffens. \u201cI\u2019ll take you,\u201d he says, releasing me.</p><p>CHAPTER SEVEN</p><p>We\u2019ve been driving for a while, not speaking, with only music for company. Jake\u2019s not heading in the direction of home. I want to ask where he\u2019s taking me. I\u2019ve wanted to ask for a while now, but I don\u2019t want to be the first to break the silence.</p><p>I hate when we fight like this.</p><p>We didn\u2019t even get to see Vintage play. Or say good-bye to Zane. I bet he thinks Jake and I are crazy together.</p><p>In many ways we are.</p><p>Jake takes a sudden turn down an unmarked treelined track and presses a call into his phone, which is nestled in the hands-free.</p><p>Dave\u2019s voice fills the car. \u201cEverything okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait at the top. Make sure nobody comes down here.\u201d</p><p>Jake clicks the phone off.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t even realised Dave was following us. It makes sense; he\u2019s only ever a step behind Jake.</p><p>We reach a clearing that opens out to a cliff-top panoramic view of LA. Even better than the view at home.</p><p>All the glittering, twinkly lights of the city of angels are before us. Or more like Jake\u2019s city of sin.</p><p>A city I\u2019m not wholly sure I belong in.</p><p>Jake kills the engine but leaves the music playing.</p><p>\u201cI come here when I need to think,\u201d he says without looking at me.</p><p>\u201cDo you need to think now?\u201d I ask, turning my head in his direction, my heart beating a hard rhythm.</p><p>He meets my eyes in the dark. \u201cNo. But we do need to talk.\u201d</p><p>Jake climbs out of the car without another word, and I follow suit.</p><p>I meet him around the front of the car, where he\u2019s leant up against it, legs crossed in front of him, arms folded over his chest.</p><p>I set myself beside him, leaving a gap. The gap of our fight. I wrap my arms around myself. \u201cWhat happened at the club will be in the news tomorrow.\u201d It\u2019s not a question, I already know the answer.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Crap.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019ll get a call from the cops soon too.\u201d</p><p>That gets my attention. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he\u2019ll file a charge for assault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t hit him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I threw him to the ground.\u201d</p><p>Jefferson was after a story. That\u2019s why he kept pushing Jake. It\u2019s my fault. That\u2019s probably why he asked me to dance in the first place. I\u2019m such an idiot.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I whisper. \u201cWhat will you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPay him to drop the charges.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d I gape.</p><p>\u201cMoney makes everything go away, Tru.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept our problems.\u201d I sigh.</p><p>\u201cYeah, everything but those.\u201d He unfurls his arms, resting his hands on the car.</p><p>I want to touch him, hold him\u2014it\u2019s killing me not to\u2014but I feel like I can\u2019t at the moment, and I\u2019m not entirely sure why.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you take us home?\u201d I ask, quietly.</p><p>\u201cBecause I want our home to be full of happy memories, not memories of us fighting. I grew up in a house where arguments were a daily occurrence, and trust me, fights stick to the walls of houses like fuckin\u2019 glue. I don\u2019t want that for us.\u201d He drags his hands through his hair, hanging them off the back of his neck, letting out a sigh.</p><p>\u201cI thought getting the new house would make things easier for you, but this place is covered in every single fuckin\u2019 mistake I made before I got you back.\u201d He gestures his open hand to the city below. \u201cAnd aside from leaving LA, I don\u2019t know what else to do to make it easier for you.\u201d</p><p>He sounds hopeless. Defeated. I hate to hear him like this.</p><p>But now, after tonight\u2019s events, leaving LA is one thing I would happily do. Move away from Jake\u2019s past, go back to the UK together, and build a life together there...but his business is here, and I can\u2019t ask him to leave that behind.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t either,\u201d I mumble in response, chewing my thumbnail.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to lose you because of who I used to be.\u201d His voice is barely a whisper.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to lose you either.\u201d</p><p>Without looking at me, he reaches over and takes the hand at my mouth. Holding it, he intertwines our fingers.</p><p>My skin burns at his touch.</p><p>\u201cThe irony,\u201d he says, \u201cis that we\u2019re both jealous because we love each other so much. God, Tru, when I saw that guy\u2019s hands on you, my head went. Just the thought of another man near you, touching you...it drives me fuckin\u2019 crazy. I can\u2019t see straight when it comes to you. It\u2019s not rational, I know. But it is what it is, and I can\u2019t change it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust like I can\u2019t change that whenever we go out, I\u2019m looking around the room, wondering which, if not all, of the women you\u2019ve had sex with.\u201d My breath catches hard in my chest. Just saying the words cuts me to the bone. \u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t know how to get past it,\u201d I add quietly.</p><p>Leaving me, Jake pushes off the car and walks toward the edge of the cliff top.</p><p>I stare at his silhouetted form, and for that moment, Jake cuts a solitary figure.</p><p>I wonder what he\u2019s thinking.</p><p>God, I hope he isn\u2019t thinking the only way is for us to break up. I know he just said he doesn\u2019t want to lose me, but what if he feels it\u2019s all too much for him? That there\u2019s no other way?</p><p>We can\u2019t break up. We can\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cWhere do we go from here?\u201d My voice is quiet, knowing we\u2019ve reached a crossroads. One I didn\u2019t see coming.</p><p>The pain in my chest is unbearable. I feel like I\u2019m crushing under the weight of my worst fear realised.</p><p>If he says we\u2019re over, I will beg him.</p><p>Jake turns back to me, a determinedness set in his face. \u201cWell, breaking up isn\u2019t even an option, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re thinking.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. Tears are starting to blur my eyes.</p><p>He walks to me. Taking my face in his hands, staring down at me, he whispers, \u201cI\u2019m not losing you, ever. I know I fuck up regularly, but I can\u2019t fuck us up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t fuck up regularly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI made a mistake tonight.\u201d</p><p>What? Oh God. No.</p><p>I don\u2019t want to know. I don\u2019t want to know.</p><p>\u201cYou did?\u201d I swallow.</p><p>\u201cYep. A big fuckin\u2019 one. I didn\u2019t tell you how amazingly beautiful you looked the instant I saw you tonight. I was so damn worried about other men looking at you, that I spoke before I thought and I made you feel self-conscious instead of making you feel as beautiful as you are.\u201d He strokes his thumb over my cheek.</p><p>I let out the breath I was holding.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I was a bitch tonight,\u201d I whisper, pulling my eyes from his. \u201cJust hearing those women talking about you like that, it threw me off guard. Then I came out of the bathroom and saw you talking to Dina. I just felt all torn up inside. I guess I did dance with Jefferson to piss you off.\u201d Biting my lip, I look back to him. \u201cI am sorry. Really.\u201d</p><p>He presses his lips to my forehead. \u201cI wish I could take all those years back so you weren\u2019t having to live them now,\u201d he says over my skin, his warm breath soothing me. \u201cBut I swear to you, I\u2019m not that person anymore. You have me, like no one before. You have me where it counts.\u201d Taking my hand, he rests it over his T-shirt, over his heart. \u201cYou hold this in the palm of your hand. You are the only woman who has ever had it, and ever will. You own me, Tru.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou own me too. Completely.\u201d</p><p>Jake stares down at me, his eyes flicker to my lips, and I feel a sudden heated charge ignite between us. Like the anger of tonight has flared up and turned into raging sexual tension. I don\u2019t know who moves first, but suddenly we\u2019re kissing, like we\u2019ve never kissed before. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It\u2019s uncoordinated and desperate. No tenderness. This is hard, starved-for-each-other kissing.</p><p>Mouths slipping over each other\u2019s, Jake\u2019s hand takes hold of my neck. Thumb against my throat, he tilts my head back farther, giving him better access. His tongue is plunging deep into my mouth, practically fucking it, and I love it.</p><p>I\u2019m all but climbing his body trying to get closer to him. My hands are everywhere.</p><p>Jake\u2019s mouth moves from mine, down my neck, biting and sucking. I moan and grind myself against his erection, wanting him badly.</p> <p>His hand moves down, tracing the cup of my bra through the sheer fabric of my top.</p><p>I reach my hand lower, cupping him through his jeans. Jake groans and pushes himself into my hand.</p><p>I\u2019m just about to open his zipper, when he steps back, breaking contact.</p><p>My heart is beating out of my chest and nearly leaps from it when he says, \u201cLose the clothes, sweetheart, and sit up on the hood.\u201d</p><p>My eyes are fixed to his. I\u2019m lost in him totally and completely. We are outside, and Jake wants us to have sex on the hood of his car.</p> <p>Honestly, I can\u2019t wait to sit myself up there.</p><p>I lose all my inhibitions around Jake. There is nothing I fear doing when I\u2019m with him. Or fearing doing for him.</p><p>I pull my top over my head, dropping it on the car, then unzip my skirt at the back, pushing it down over my hips.</p><p>I watch Jake watching me, loving the way his eyes devour every naked inch that I reveal to him.</p><p>No one has ever looked at me before the way he does. Like I am the only person in the whole world. That having me\u2014being inside me\u2014is the only thing that will ever matter to him.</p><p>Stepping out of my skirt, I pick it up and drop it on the car.</p> <p>I\u2019m about to kick my shoes off, when Jake says in a rough voice, \u201cKeep the heels on.\u201d</p><p>I step back, letting my ass meet with the car. I sit up on it, hooking my heels into the bumper, the paintwork warm on my skin from the heat of the engine.</p><p>Now I\u2019m closer to the car, I can make out the song that has just started to play. \u201cPour Some Sugar on Me\u201d by Def Leppard.</p><p>Jake obviously registers the song too, because the tilt of his head and the inferred smile he gives practically has me wetting my panties.</p><p>Holy fuck.</p><p>Jake approaches, removing his T-shirt as he does. He tosses it onto the car and moves past me. My eyes follow him as he leans in through the open window.</p><p>I hear the music grow louder.</p><p>Then Jake is back, coming to stand between my legs, he leans against me, chest on chest, reaching over my shoulder, he grabs for something, and then I feel the silky fabric of my top brush over my skin.</p> <p>\u201cDo you trust me?\u201d he murmurs.</p><p>My body starts to tremble, knowing where he\u2019s going with this.</p><p>I nod slowly, my eyes captivated by his.</p><p>I watch as Jake twists my silk top into a thin strip of fabric. He brings it to rest over my eyes, tying it in a tight knot at the back of my head.</p><p>\u201cLie back,\u201d he whispers in my ear.</p><p>I do as he says, my whole body quaking with nerves and sexual excitement.</p><p>We\u2019re out in the open. Dave is at the top of the track, playing guard. I\u2019m blindfolded by my own top, and Jake is about to make love to me on his sexy Aston Martin with \u201cPour Some Sugar on Me\u201d playing in the background.</p><p>Could he be any fucking hotter?</p><p>Jake kisses me once on the mouth, and then I feel his body move down mine.</p><p>All I can hear is Joe Elliott\u2019s rough vocals in my ear. I feel the heavy drum and electric guitar pumping through the metal of the car, vibrating against my skin, and Jake\u2019s mouth on me.</p><p>He frees my swollen breast from my bra and runs his tongue around my nipple, taking my breast into his mouth.</p><p>I groan, feeling it between my legs via the tethered line to my sex. I push my fingers into his thick hair, winding them into it.</p><p>Jake repeats the motion with my left breast, while his hand caresses the right. He rubs the peak of my nipple between his thumb and forefinger almost to the point of pain. Pleasure pain.</p><p>It feels even better in the dark. Feeling, not seeing. And it\u2019s so very fucking hot.</p><p>Jake kisses down my stomach, I feel his tongue and hot breath moving over my highly sensitised skin. He dips his tongue into my navel, and then I feel his fingers tracing the line between my panties and skin.</p><p>\u201cNew ones?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I shake my head.</p><p>Jake rips them off, and I swear to God I\u2019m sure I feel his teeth against me when he does.</p><p>Did he just tear my panties off with his teeth?</p><p>Holy fucking hotness!</p><p>I honestly don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever being as turned on as I am right now.</p><p>I\u2019m about ready to jump up, tear his clothes off, and shag him senseless, when I feel Jake\u2019s finger touch my sex. My hips jerk in response. Holding me down with one hand spanning my stomach, he moves his finger between my cleft, stroking gently, then up over my throbbing clit.</p><p>\u201cSo wet,\u201d he murmurs.</p><p>I so absolutely am. And I\u2019m so absolutely desperate for the feel of his tongue on me that I\u2019m getting ready to beg if he doesn\u2019t put it there in the next five seconds.</p><p>He removes his finger from me, the loss of momentary contact almost painful.</p><p>Then I feel his tongue on me, and lights explode behind my eyelids.</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d I moan in absolute pleasure, relaxing into the feel of his mouth on me.</p><p>I feel Jake\u2019s finger enter me slowly, as his tongue teases and explores. In goes another finger, stretching me, readying me for his huge cock.</p><p>This is going to be over very quickly. It\u2019s just so insanely erotic that I can\u2019t even find the will to want to hold off.</p><p>\u201cOh God, Jake...I\u2019m gonna...I\u2019m gonna...\u201d</p><p>My whole body is trembling. The sensation and rise working higher and higher. Jake\u2019s fingers move harder, in and out, his tongue mercilessly taking me over to complete bliss.</p><p>My fingernails scratch over the paintwork as I try to find something to cling to. Sweat mists my skin. My body writhes from the torturous pleasure Jake is giving me.</p><p>\u201cCome,\u201d he commands.</p><p>A lick, a stroke, and...</p><p>\u201cFuck, Jake!\u201d I scream his name out as the most mind-blowing orgasm tears through my body, literally lifting me up off the car.</p><p>After very long moments of intense, serious pleasure, I drop back down to earth, my limbs gooey, relaxed. The tension of our earlier fight very much forgotten.</p><p>I hear the zipper on Jake\u2019s pants open.</p><p>I love that sound.</p><p>Jake moves between my legs, nudging them farther apart with his hips. I can feel the denim of his jeans against my thighs. I love that he hasn\u2019t even waited to take them off. He wants me so badly that the longest he can wait is to get it out of his pants.</p><p>I feel the head of his cock pressing at my entrance.</p><p>He pulls the blindfold off my eyes. Staring down at me with a blazing gaze, teeth gritted, he says, \u201cI\u2019m going in hard, baby. I need to fuck you raw. You ready?\u201d</p><p>I know he has barely any control right now, I can see it in the clench of his jaw, the dark of his eyes. The only thing on his mind right now is the fighting need to come, fucking me until he\u2019s dry.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so ready,\u201d I breathe.</p><p>Jake slams into me.</p><p>I cry out at the feel of him filling me, exquisitely stretching me to the extreme like only he can.</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d he groans, stilling momentarily.</p><p>His hands grip my hips, fingers digging into me, and then he starts to move hard and fast, pounding into me over and over.</p><p>Grunts and groans emit from Jake, the scent of our unrestrained sex flowing into me with every ragged breath I take, driving me closer to the edge of another orgasm.</p><p>Jake drives into me with a deep-seated force, his fingers finding me, spreading me, aiding to drive my second orgasm to the brink.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re mine. Say it, Tru.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m yours,\u201d I cry out.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll always be mine,\u201d he growls. \u201cGod, you\u2019re just so fuckin\u2019 sexy, so hot...I need...I need...\u201d</p><p>I know what he needs.</p><p>\u201cC\u00f3rrete para m\u00ed, cari\u00f1o!\u201d I say in a commanding tone.</p><p>Jake yells out an expletive, and then I feel him pumping his sweet liquid into me.</p><p>My own orgasm takes over, my muscles tensing and contracting around his cock.</p><p>When Jake is empty of everything he has, he leans over me, still inside me, resting his chest heavily against mine. Our slick skin sticking together, he kisses my lips gently.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I was a jealous ass tonight,\u201d he says against my mouth.</p><p>\u201cWere those orgasms part of the apology?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid they work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, absolutely.\u201d I smile. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I was jealous too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll forgotten, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. I guess we make a good pair. A good jealous pair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe best jealous pair ever,\u201d he murmurs, squeezing me tight.</p><p>After a moment, Jake eases himself out of me, and I sit myself up, hair ruffled and thoroughly fucked.</p><p>\u201cSo you finally got to do the blindfolding thing.\u201d I grin.</p><p>\u201cI told you that you were kinky.\u201d He smirks at me.</p><p>\u201cMe? You were the one fixing me up with it!\u201d I say, throwing his T-shirt at him.</p><p>He catches it, laughing, and pulls it on.</p><p>As I\u2019m sliding on my own, now severely wrinkled, top, I add, \u201cSaying that, though...I wouldn\u2019t say no to you doing it again. Maybe tying me up one time too.\u201d I bite my lip.</p><p>Jake inhales sharply and his eyes darken like I\u2019ve never before known.</p><p>He picks my skirt up and thrusts it into my hand.</p><p>\u201cGet dressed.\u201d His tone is urgent.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d I look around, expecting to see someone coming. Maybe Dave.</p><p>\u201cNothing\u2019s wrong. Far from it. Sweetheart, you have just given me the green light to tie you up and fuck you. I\u2019ve wanted to do that to you for a very long time. Now I just want to get you back home to our bed, so I can tie you to it and fuck you senseless, again, before you change your mind.\u201d</p><p>Hopping off the bonnet, pulling my skirt on, I zip it up at the back and make my way toward the passenger side.</p><p>Opening the door, I glance over the car at him. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, baby, I won\u2019t be changing my mind. I\u2019ve wanted you to do it to me for a while now too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy the fuck didn\u2019t you say so before?\u201d He grins, hopping in the car and firing up the engine.</p><p>Jake has us out of there and back home in record time. Before I know it, I\u2019m naked again. My wrists are bound to the bed with one of my silk scarves while Jake makes both our fantasies come true.</p><p>JAKE...</p><p>CHAPTER EIGHT</p><p>I say we wrap it up for today; I don\u2019t think we\u2019re getting any more down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Denny says through a yawn from behind his drum kit, stretching his arms over his head. \u201cMy head\u2019s mashed now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBunch of pussies, you\u2019ve got no fucking stamina,\u201d Tom pipes up, strumming his bass.</p><p>\u201cYou done?\u201d I ask Smith.</p><p>Smith is the lead guitarist we brought on board as an unofficial replacement for Jonny. Jonny, my best friend and band member, who died in a car accident a year and a half ago. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah.\u201d His eyes flick to the clock. \u201cI need to get home anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHome to the wifey,\u201d Tom says, grinning. \u201cI was gonna suggest we all go out for a beer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo can do.\u201d Smith unplugs his guitar from the amp and puts it in its stand. \u201cMy folks are down from Tennessee for a few days, and we\u2019re taking them out for dinner.\u201d</p><p>Tom shrugs, then turns to me and Denny. \u201cWhat about you two fuckers?

You do realize that you are officially more pussy whipped than lover boy over there.\u201d He nods in Denny\u2019s direction.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but Simone is in London, so he\u2019s not hard to beat. And no, I\u2019m not calling for permission, fuck-wad. It\u2019s called being in a relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never thought I would see the day that Jake Wethers would be bending over for a woman.\u201d Tom grins, putting his bass in its case.</p><p>\u201cLove, man. It\u2019ll get you one day,\u201d Smith says.</p> <p>\u201cNot fuckin\u2019 likely!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmith,\u201d Denny says, \u201caside from the fact there is no woman stupid enough to want to settle down with Tom, do you really think we\u2019ll ever see the day he\u2019ll be satisfied with sticking his dick in one chick for the rest of his life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoint taken.\u201d Smith grins in Tom\u2019s direction. \u201cI take it back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn fuckin\u2019 right! There\u2019s more than enough of the cat to go around. Why deny all of those women the pleasure of Tom? I\u2019m generous to a fault, and I share myself around accordingly. And since the snake took himself off the market, the demand on my cock has doubled. Someone\u2019s gotta keep all the chicks happy now that he\u2019s a one-woman man.\u201d He grabs his crotch, grinning.</p><p>I let out a laugh. \u201cYou\u2019re more than welcome to them, man.\u201d</p><p>Tom pauses and looks at me like I\u2019m some fucking puzzle he can\u2019t work out. \u201cSeriously, dude. Tru must be an awesome lay to keep your interest for this long. That or the rack. It\u2019s the rack, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s gotta be the rack.\u201d He puts his hands to his chest, sizing out a pair of tits. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a pair that big that are actually real. They would seriously keep my attention for a long time. Not as long as you, but fuck...do you just sit and stare at them all day? I seriously would.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re obsessed with tits!\u201d Denny laughs, tapping his drum with the stick.</p><p>\u201cI appreciate great tits, and Tru has great tits. I\u2019m also enjoying winding up pussy fucker over there.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m taking it he\u2019s referring to the scowl on my face. I give him a look and reach over to switch off the amps. \u201cKeep talking about my girl\u2019s rack like that, and you\u2019ll need an expensive fuckin\u2019 dental surgeon after I\u2019ve knocked all your teeth out.\u201d</p><p>The motherfucker winds me up to no end when he talks about Tru like that. He\u2019s right\u2014she has got great tits\u2014but I don\u2019t want him going on about them. He is the only one I would let get away with comments like that for this long. I\u2019d have knocked anyone else out by now.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get your panties all in a twist, I\u2019m just yanking your chain.\u201d Tom pats me on the shoulder. \u201cDen, you up for that beer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot nothing better to do.\u201d He climbs out from behind his kit.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m out of here. Catch you fuckers later,\u201d Smith says, heading for the door. \u201cOh, Jake,\u201d he adds, turning back, \u201cmy old lady asked if you and Tru want to go out for dinner after my folks leave on Friday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good. I\u2019ll check with Tru and let you know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCool, I\u2019m outta here. Catch you all tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m real glad Smith\u2019s wife suggested a night out. I know Tru is missing Simone, and I know she\u2019d never say it, but she\u2019s lonely for female company. I think she\u2019d get on real well with Carly; she\u2019s a cool chick.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna call Tru. I\u2019ll meet you two idiots in the car in a few.\u201d</p><p>I head out of the studio, walking toward my office, calling Tru as I go.</p><p>\u201cHey, baby,\u201d she coos down the phone.</p><p>God, she sounds so fucking sexy. I love her voice. Especially when it\u2019s screaming out my name while I\u2019m inside her.</p><p>\u201cHey, beautiful. Before I forget, Smith\u2019s wife invited us out for dinner on Friday. You up for that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like fun. I\u2019m in. So when are you coming home?\u201d She turns the sexy voice on, and I feel it all the way down to my cock. \u201cI bought this tub of cookies-and-cream ice cream earlier, and I was thinking when you get home, we can take it to bed, and you could maybe...eat it off me. You can blindfold me again too, if you want.\u201d</p><p>If I want. Is she serious? Right now, I want nothing more.</p><p>I groan in my pants. Walking into my office, I close the door behind me and readjust my cock. \u201cFuck, baby, you\u2019ve made me hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was kinda the point.\u201d I can practically hear her salacious smile.</p><p>\u201cGood job I\u2019m alone, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat as well,\u201d she says, giggling. \u201cSo how long will you be?\u201d</p><p>Staring down at my hard-on, I\u2019m torn between that and going out with the boys. I blow out a breath, letting my head fall back against the door, knowing Tom will never let me live it down if I blow them off to go home to my girl. \u201cThat\u2019s why I was calling. I just said I\u2019d go out with the boys for a beer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>I hear her disappointed tone loud and clear. It cuts me.</p><p>\u201cIf I don\u2019t go, I\u2019ll never hear the end of it from Tom,\u201d I explain.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, baby, I understand. You should go out with the boys. I take up too much of your time as it is. I\u2019m just disappointed I have to wait a little longer to see you is all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to take up all my time.\u201d</p><p>I hear her breathing down the line. \u201cMe too. Now go have fun with the guys. I\u2019ll be here waiting for when you get back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith the tub of ice cream?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost definitely.\u201d</p><p>I smile. \u201cWhat will you do while I\u2019m out?\u201d I hate to think of her there, all alone.</p><p>\u201cI might call Stuart, see if he\u2019s free to watch a movie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall? He lives a fucking stone\u2019s throw from us, lazy-ass.\u201d</p><p>She giggles. I fucking love that sound.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m lazy and proud of it! What can I say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay you love me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d she breathes. And I feel it everywhere, almost like her pretty little hands are running all over me right now.</p><p>\u201cLove you more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d I smile. \u201cI\u2019ll show you later exactly how much I love you.\u201d</p><p>A bang on the door frightens the shit out of me, and then Tom\u2019s loud voice booms. \u201cCome on, motherfucker! Stop whispering sweet nothings to Tru and get your tardy ass out here and in the car. I\u2019m fuckin\u2019 dying for a drink!\u201d</p><p>Shaking my head, laughing, I say, \u201cGotta go, baby, the boys are waiting. I\u2019ll see you later.\u201d</p><p>I hang up with Tru, and when I get to the car, Tom and Denny are in the back waiting.</p><p>\u201cWhere to?\u201d Dave asks, pulling out of the parking space.</p><p>I look over my shoulder at Tom and Denny.</p><p>\u201cD\u00e9j\u00e0-fuckin\u2019-vu!\u201d Tom grins.</p><p>\u201cNo fuckin\u2019 way, man! I\u2019m not going to a strip joint. If Tru finds out, she\u2019ll kick my ass.\u201d</p><p>Tom rolls his eyes. \u201cOkay, Crazy Girls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said no strip joints.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a strip joint. It\u2019s a respectable establishment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a bikini bar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. Tits and ass all covered. Tru can\u2019t get pissed about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way.\u201d I shake my head.</p><p>\u201cStop being such a pussy!\u201d Tom exclaims. \u201cYou do still have a dick in there, don\u2019t you?\u201d He nods in the direction of my pants.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m with Jake on this one, man,\u201d Denny chips in. \u201cNo strip joints or bikini bars,\u201d he adds just as Tom opens his mouth to start up again. \u201cLet\u2019s just go to a normal club.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor fuck\u2019s sake! You\u2019re a right pair of boring bastards! I expect this shit from him\u201d\u2014he jerks his head in Denny\u2019s direction\u2014\u201cbut you, man,\u201d he says to me, \u201cI\u2019m disappointed, and also a little gutted. I\u2019ve well and truly lost my wingman. I might as well be on fuckin\u2019 date night with Stuart, being with you two. Next thing you\u2019ll say is let\u2019s go to a gay bar because there\u2019re no women there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019re usually more women in gay bars than normal bars,\u201d Denny adds.</p><p>Tom\u2019s eyes light up.</p><p>\u201cNo fuckin\u2019 way!\u201d I cut him off before he can speak. \u201cWe are not going to a gay bar.\u201d</p><p>Turning to Dave, I say, \u201cTake us to Graphics.\u201d</p><p>Dave pulls up outside Graphics and climbs out with us, giving the valet the keys to the car.</p><p>Graphics is a celeb haunt that used to be a favourite of ours. Especially Jonny. I have a lot of memories of this place.</p><p>Good and bad.</p><p>\u201cMr. Wethers, it\u2019s been a while, good to see you again,\u201d the host says as we approach the door. \u201cYou should have called ahead and we\u2019d have secured your booth for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a last-minute thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me see what I can do for you.\u201d He starts speaking quickly into his headset.</p><p>I hate this shit. It used to be cool when these idiots wanted to pander to me, but it got old, real fast. Now I wish I could hit a club without having to announce my arrival first, so that it doesn\u2019t become some major fucking issue if I don\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cLook, don\u2019t sweat it,\u201d I say, when I see him talking into the headset. \u201cJust sit us anywhere. The boys and me just wanna have a quiet drink.\u201d</p><p>He looks at me, unsure, then nods. \u201cOkay, we have a table ready for you now, please follow me.\u201d</p><p>We follow him through the club to the VIP section.</p><p>I nod to a few people I know as I pass through.</p><p>I slide into the booth, and the waitress is at our table a second later.</p><p>She\u2019s all tits and ass. The outfits here leave little to the imagination. I forgot that.</p><p>I used to like this shit. Used to love seeing women wearing as little clothing as possible.</p><p>Now with Tru, I get just as turned on seeing her in a pair of jeans and T-shirt as I do those sexy miniskirts she wears.</p><p>She always looks hot to me.</p><p>I order a round of beers for us and settle back in my seat.</p><p>Tapping my fingers on the table, wishing I\u2019d had a smoke before I came in here, I see Jase Collins heading toward our table.</p><p>Jase Collins. Small-timer in the music industry. Big-timer in the drug scene. And once upon a time, one of my regular dealers.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>\u201cBeen a while,\u201d he says, leaning up against our table.</p><p>\u201cNot long enough,\u201d I reply dryly.</p><p>He laughs. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Does he think I\u2019m joking or something? Fucking idiot.</p><p>\u201cTom, Den.\u201d He nods at them.</p><p>The best they offer back is a couple of grunts in his direction.</p><p>I have to suppress a smile. To say they don\u2019t like him is putting it mildly. He\u2019s a cocky little fucker who once served his purpose of scoring the best coke around for me.</p> <p>Not anymore.</p><p>Right now, I want this fucker as far away from me as possible. Just knowing what he\u2019ll have in his pocket is scratching at my skin like sharp fucking needles.</p><p>I flick a glance in Dave\u2019s direction. He\u2019s at the bar, watching Jase like a hawk.</p><p>Meeting my eyes, Dave gives me a silent nod. If I need to get rid of him quick, Dave will see to it for me.</p><p>The waitress reappears with our beers. Stepping around Jase, she puts our drinks down for us.</p> <p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I say. I return my focus to Jase. \u201cWhat can I do for you, Jase?\u201d I ask, getting straight to the point. No sense beating around the bush, wasting my time on a piece of shit like him.</p><p>\u201cHeard you\u2019re getting married. Wanted to offer my congratulations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReceived, and thanks.\u201d</p><p>He stares at me for a long moment, then, resting his hand on the back of the seat, leans over and says in my ear, \u201cThe boss is missing your business. I got some real good shit on me tonight that has your name written all over it.\u201d</p><p>I push him away from me with a firm shove to his shoulder. \u201cNot interested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure about that?\u201d He smiles. It\u2019s a cocky smile. One that I want to wipe off his face.</p> <p>\u201cNever been more so. Now will you fuck off? I\u2019m trying to have a night out with my buddies.\u201d I pick my beer up, tipping my head back. I drink it, but I don\u2019t move my eyes from his.</p><p>\u201cI saw a picture of your girl in the papers. Trudy Bennett, right? A real English beauty you got yourself there, Jake. I hear she\u2019s living over here now.\u201d</p><p>Slamming my beer down on the table, I stand up, the force shoving the table forward into Jase. Tom and Den are on their feet in an instant.</p><p>I see Dave moving toward us, but I put my hand out, telling him I got this.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t talk about her, motherfucker. Your mouth is nowhere near clean enough to speak my girl\u2019s name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI meant no disrespect,\u201d he says with a smirk, and steps back. \u201cJust letting you know I think your girl is pretty. Real pretty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know exactly what you\u2019re doing, motherfucker. And I think you\u2019ve forgotten who you\u2019re talking to.\u201d I round the table, squaring up to him. \u201cYou know what I\u2019m capable of, so don\u2019t fuck with me,\u201d I hiss in his face. \u201cForget you ever heard my girl\u2019s name, let alone saw her face. You fuckin\u2019 read me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLoud and clear.\u201d He lifts his hands, backing off. \u201cLike I said, I meant no disrespect, Jake. Enjoy your night.\u201d</p> <p>I watch him go, blending back into the crowd. My body is thrumming with absolute fucking anger.</p><p>\u201cYou all right, man?\u201d Denny asks as I sit back down.</p><p>I shake my head, taking a pull on my beer.</p><p>I\u2019m smarting. Jase fucking Collins, laying a threat near my girl. Fucking bastard. I\u2019ll take his head off.</p><p>Tru. She\u2019s at home alone.</p><p>I motion Dave over.</p><p>\u201cSend Ben over to the house to watch Tru,\u201d I say quietly to him.</p><p>\u201cHe threaten her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, just being a clever bastard. But I don\u2019t take any chances where she\u2019s concerned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call Ben now, and I\u2019ll call the house security to tell them to turn it up a notch.\u201d</p><p>Taking my phone out, I\u2019m ready to call her, but then I decide against it. I don\u2019t want to frighten her.</p><p>\u201cLet me know when Ben\u2019s at the house,\u201d I say to Dave before he walks off to make the call.</p><p>\u201cWas that fuck-wad laying a threat near Tru?\u201d Tom asks me.</p><p>\u201cNo, just being a cocky fucker.\u201d Even as I say the words, I still feel twitchy as hell. I know his threat was empty, but it still makes me anxious.</p><p>\u201cI hate that little shit. You should have kicked his ass years ago, man. Hell, you should kick his ass now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe fuckin\u2019 mentions Tru one more time and I will. Motherfucker,\u201d I utter, taking another swig of my beer.</p><p>The downside of being an ex-user is knowing scum of the earth like Jase Collins.</p><p>I\u2019m real glad Den and Tom never got mixed up in that shit. Even with the life we lead, and the people we\u2019re around, they\u2019ve managed to never touch drugs. They had the odd joint in college, sure, but they\u2019ve never dabbled in the harder stuff. It\u2019s especially amazing considering how much Jonny and I used to hit it.</p><p>I\u2019m glad for it. I got too fucked up on the stuff. I never want that for either of them.</p><p>They tried to intervene when I was at my low point, but back then I didn\u2019t want anyone\u2019s help except from the likes of scum like Jase Collins, who could provide me with exactly what I needed.</p><p>I never ever want to go back there.</p><p>I\u2019m lucky Tom and Den stuck with me. Even more lucky that I have Tru back in my life.</p><p>Draining my beer and needing the buzz of more alcohol, I call the waitress over.</p><p>It\u2019s a different waitress, I notice. Tits even bigger than the last one\u2019s, and they\u2019re about as fake as her blonde hair. I get a pretty close look as she leans over our table to clear the first round, practically sticking them in my face.</p><p>Ignoring her as best I can, I avert my eyes and say, \u201cBottle of Jack, and another round of beers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right back with your order, boys,\u201d she says in a Southern drawl.</p><p>Leaning back, hands pressed flat on the table, coming to my eye level, she gives me a \u201cfuck me now\u201d stare, pressing her red lips together. Then turning, making sure I get a good view of her ass, she slowly walks away.</p><p>\u201cNow you\u2019re fuckin\u2019 talking with the Jack, man!\u201d Tom bangs his fist on the table, getting my attention. \u201cYou up for getting hammered?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbso-fucking-lutely.\u201d I\u2019m still feeling wired and twitchy after Jase Collins\u2019s visit, and I need something to take the edge off.</p><p>There are only three things that can take the edge off for me\u2014alcohol, cigarettes, and sex. Considering I currently can\u2019t do two of them, I\u2019m hitting the one I can do, hard.</p><p>The waitress returns and puts our drinks down on the table.</p><p>I let out a laugh at Tom, who\u2019s staring down her top\u2014if it can be called a top. It\u2019s more like a piece of fabric covering her nipples.</p><p>He just shrugs and grins at me.</p><p>Before leaving she tucks her tray under her arm and runs her fingernails down my biceps in an intimate way.</p><p>It pisses me off. I give her a less-than-amused look.</p><p>She smiles, apparently not reading my look correctly, then blatantly focuses her stare on my cock, licking her lips, before leaving.</p><p>\u201cI fuckin\u2019 love the outfits here,\u201d Tom says, watching her as she walks away. \u201cAnd the girls in them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOutfits?\u201d Denny laughs, gesturing at the belts as skirts and the half-cut tanks. \u201cWhat fuckin\u2019 outfits?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d Tom grins.</p><p>I used to think like Tom. It was one of the many reasons I would come here. The waitresses are always half-dressed, and most of them are as easy as fuck.</p><p>They\u2019re no different than groupies. They all want on a celeb\u2019s cock in the hope it will lead to more for them. Get them out of those tanks and into designer threads, walking the red carpet.</p><p>The reality is less than that. Much less. Most of the guys who come here usually have a girl at home and are looking for an uncomplicated fuck on the side. No strings attached.</p><p>It was the same for me, except I had no girl at home waiting for me back then.</p><p>If I wanted to get laid and high when I was in LA, Graphics was the best place to come.</p><p>Honestly, I don\u2019t know what made me suggest coming here tonight.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s after getting on your cock.\u201d Tom nods in the direction of the blonde waitress who currently has her eyes pinned on our table. More specifically, pinned on me.</p><p>Picking my fresh beer up, I say, \u201cShe can want on it all she likes. Fact is, it\u2019s not happening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d Tom raises his eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGotta say, man, you\u2019re being real faithful to Tru. I couldn\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you haven\u2019t got her.\u201d</p><p>When Tru first came back into my life, it wasn\u2019t that I stopped wanting other women for fear of losing her. The simple fact is I stopped wanting anyone else full stop. I\u2019m not interested in anyone but her. It was weird to me for a long time, but now it makes absolute sense.</p><p>She is all I want.</p><p>No one gets me like she does. And I love her like I never knew possible.</p><p>Sex became about love for me the first night Tru gave herself to me in that hotel room in Copenhagen. I don\u2019t ever want to go back from that.</p><p>Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m still a guy. I know a hot piece of ass when I see it. The difference is, now I don\u2019t want to tap it.</p><p>All I want to do tonight is have some drinks with the guys, then go home to Tru, climb in bed with her, wrap my arms tight around her, and kiss her until I can\u2019t breathe.</p><p>That, and lick ice cream off that hot fucking body of hers.</p><p>Of course, I\u2019d never say any of this shit out loud. Tom would have my balls checked for me if I did.</p><p>Dave comes over to me. \u201cAll\u2019s good. Ben\u2019s at the house. Stuart\u2019s there with her watching a movie. She\u2019s fine. No need to worry.\u201d</p><p>I feel myself relax. I was considering blowing the night off real soon, but she\u2019d know something was wrong if I did. She\u2019s as sharp as a tack. And to be honest, I just need to be out with the guys for a while.</p><p>I get my phone out and type a quick text to her while those two talk shit.</p><p>Can\u2019t wait to see you later, beautiful. Keep that ice cream on chill ready for me. x</p><p>It beeps back a few seconds later:</p><p>That\u2019s not all I\u2019m keeping ready for you ;)</p><p>Fuck me. I tap out a response, smiling to myself:</p><p>You\u2019re making me hard again.</p><p>Another text back:</p><p>Keep that ready for me and I\u2019ll see to it later. x</p><p>I cast a quick glance at the guys, then reply:</p><p>I fuckin love you, hard. x</p><p>She responds seconds later:</p><p>Love you too, baby. x</p><p>\u201cStop texting Tru, or I\u2019m gonna throw your fuckin\u2019 cell out of the window,\u201d Tom jokes.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I shove it back in my pocket.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s Tru doing tonight?\u201d Denny asks.</p><p>\u201cWatching a movie at home with Stuart. She\u2019s missing Simone and their nights out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSimone was saying the other day how much she misses Tru. She\u2019s trying to book a few weeks off work in a month or so to come for a visit. Don\u2019t tell Tru, though. She wants to surprise her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t say a word.\u201d I take another pull on my beer and realize it\u2019s nearly empty. Fuck, these are going down easy.</p><p>I line up the glasses the waitress brought with the Jack and pour out three whiskeys.</p><p>As I\u2019m pushing the glasses across the table, Tom says, \u201cBeen a while since we\u2019ve all been out together like this.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He sounds so fucking nostalgic. I feel the instant hit of the empty seat in this booth.</p><p>Jonny.</p><p>\u201cYeah, it has been a while. Too long.\u201d I stare down into my glass. \u201cYou remember how we used to be out every night when Jonny was still here?\u201d I say, lifting my head.</p><p>Surprising myself as I say it, I realise saying his name doesn\u2019t hurt as much as it used to. There was one point where I couldn\u2019t even finish a sentence if his name was in it.</p> <p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Tom laughs lightly. \u201cJonny wouldn\u2019t give us a fuckin\u2019 reprieve back then. He had us out every night, tapping ass and drinking hard liquor. That\u2019s why we can all hold our drink so well now. Taught by the best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou still can\u2019t hold your liquor.\u201d Denny laughs at him.</p><p>\u201cFuck you! I could drink you under the table any night of the fuckin\u2019 week!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBring it on,\u201d Denny challenges.</p><p>\u201cYou are so fuckin\u2019 on.\u201d Tom waves the blonde waitress over.</p> <p>Here we go.</p><p>\u201cCan we have three Flaming Sambucas, sugar, and a line of tequilas, and keep \u2019em coming \u2019til I say stop,\u201d Tom orders.</p><p>\u201cSure thing, darlin\u2019. Anything else I can get you?\u201d She turns to me, leans over, puts her hand on my shoulder, and says into my ear, \u201cMaybe me, again?\u201d</p><p>Again? Shit, have I fucked her before?</p><p>I give her face a quick glance. No recollection whatsoever.</p><p>I don\u2019t know whether to be relieved or shit scared at that realization.</p> <p>Truth is, I don\u2019t think I would recognize near to half of the women I\u2019ve screwed.</p><p>To remember I would\u2019ve had to have cared, and I never cared.</p><p>One in, one out. Those girls were just nameless faces.</p><p>Until Tru.</p><p>She changed everything. She changed me.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I say, ducking my shoulder out from under her hand. \u201cIf it\u2019s a quick fuck you\u2019re looking for, I\u2019m not your guy. I\u2019m getting married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I heard.\u201d She runs her tongue over her lower lip, then tugs her lip between her teeth. \u201cBut you\u2019re not married yet, Jake, so technically you\u2019re still single, and I\u2019m more than willing to get you off real good without a word to your girl. Right now, I want you to come with me on my break, and I\u2019ll put my mouth to real good use. A little reminder of what I can do.\u201d Moving closer again, she whispers in my ear, \u201cI\u2019ll blow you so good, honey, you won\u2019t ever want me to stop.\u201d</p><p>Nothing. Not even a twitch in my dick.</p> <p>Before Tru, I wouldn\u2019t have hesitated. I\u2019d have pushed her under the table and gotten her to blow me right here.</p><p>Right now all I want to do is laugh.</p><p>Struggling not to be a bastard and hurt this chick\u2019s feelings, even though I\u2019m really tempted to tell her she can\u2019t have been that fucking memorable the first time around, I laugh and say, \u201cI\u2019m far from single, honey. My girl gets me off just fine. More than fine, she\u2019s fuckin\u2019 amazing. You\u2019re not a patch on her\u2014no offense. You wanna get laid, you\u2019re gonna have to look elsewhere. Like I said before, I\u2019m not your guy.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze practically burns a hole in me.</p><p>Okay, so maybe I wasn\u2019t as kind as I could have been.</p><p>\u201cHey, sugar, if you\u2019re up for a fuck, I\u2019ll happily step in where he\u2019s lacking,\u201d Tom says, catching her attention.</p><p>She pulls herself away from me and focuses in on Tom.</p><p>I nearly breathe a sigh of relief to have her and her cheap perfume out of my face.</p><p>\u201cBound and chained Jake is, but I\u2019m as free as a bird,\u201d Tom says.</p><p>\u201cTom Carter, right?\u201d she says, straightening up, pushing her chest out.</p><p>\u201cThe one and only.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard great things about you.\u201d She shifts her gaze downward on him. \u201cA few of the girls have been to your place, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d He grins.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking my break now.\u201d She tilts her head for him to follow her.</p><p>\u201cBoys, I\u2019ll be back in half an hour.\u201d</p><p>Tom gets up and grabs the waitress by the hand. I watch him lead her off through the crowd.</p><p>I shake my head, laughing.</p><p>\u201cSkank,\u201d as Tru would say.</p><p>At least Tom\u2019s getting his rocks off for a few. I\u2019d say he has no shame, but then, there was a time I would have done exactly the same. And really, I should thank him for taking her heat-seeking-missile gaze from me and focusing it straight onto him.</p><p>\u201cAh shit, Tom\u2019s just fucked off to the bathroom with our easy access to shots,\u201d Denny complains.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got the Jack,\u201d I say, picking it up. I pour Denny another, then myself.</p><p>\u201cSo you off to London in a few days?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and I can\u2019t fuckin\u2019 wait.\u201d Denny leans back against the seat, resting his head on the top as he takes a drink. \u201cFeels like it\u2019s been fuckin\u2019 ages since I last saw Simone. Well, it has been fuckin\u2019 ages,\u201d he adds.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how you do it, man. I couldn\u2019t be away from Tru like you are with Simone. Just a night away from her does my head in.\u201d</p><p>I can talk to Denny like this and know he won\u2019t bust my nuts because he knows where I\u2019m coming from. Tom, on the other hand, will never understand.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard fuckin\u2019 going,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it\u2019s just the way things have to be at the moment. Her work\u2019s there and mine is here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t she get a transfer out here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah.\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cHer company doesn\u2019t have an office out here. It would mean her having to get a new job, and I know how much she loves working at that place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want her to move out here, though?\u201d</p><p>He takes another long drink, then, leaning forward, puts it on the table. He cups the glass in his hands, swirling it around.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo tell her.\u201d I pour more whiskey into my glass and gesture to Denny.</p><p>He moves his hands, allowing me to pour it in.</p><p>\u201cI told Tru how I felt, asked her to move in with me, and she did. You\u2019ve got nothing to lose by asking Simone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess.\u201d He shrugs. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to her about it when I see her.\u201d He throws his drink back in one. \u201cFuck this, I\u2019m getting hammered.\u201d He gestures for a waitress and puts in another order of shots for us. \u201cHey, what happened at that club the other night? Zane said you knocked some dude on his ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome dickhead who Tru knew from London had his hands all over her, so I knocked him on his ass. Wish I\u2019d done a lot more, to be honest.\u201d</p><p>Like broken his fucking nose. Motherfucker filed an assault charge just like I knew he would. Then I got served from his lawyer.</p><p>I just gave my lawyer the nod to pay him off. I can do without the hassle of little fuck-wads like him. Honestly, to keep his hands off Tru, it\u2019s worth every cent.</p><p>\u201cSounds like he deserved it,\u201d Denny muses.</p><p>\u201cToo fuckin\u2019 right he did.\u201d</p><p>Denny and I have just knocked back our first round of tequila shots when Tom reappears at our table.</p><p>\u201cDude, that was quick,\u201d I say as he lands back in his seat. \u201cFifteen minutes\u2014must be a fuckin\u2019 record for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was long enough. Just a quick blow job; then I banged her, and I was more than ready to come by that point. Not the best blow job ever, or fuck, for that matter. She\u2019s been rode too many times, so I just visualised fucking Maxine Halliday and I was coming in no time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaxine Halliday from college?\u201d I ask, grinning.</p><p>She was hot as fuck, and one girl I never nailed. That was only because Tom was fucking her. We didn\u2019t share back then.</p><p>Not that I share now. No one touches my girl but me.</p><p>\u201cThe very one. Man, you remember her? She was hot as sin. I screwed her all over campus. I even fingered her during a lecture once, had her coming all over my hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for the visuals,\u201d Denny says.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very welcome.\u201d Tom pats him on the shoulder. \u201cAnd go easy on me. I was taking one for the team, banging that waitress. She wasn\u2019t gonna let up on Jake, so I diverted her attention from his cock to mine. And you can thank me now.\u201d Tom looks in my direction. \u201cI call it a bottle of the most expensive champagne they have here, and I\u2019m being generous at that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me to buy you an expensive bottle of champagne for fucking some cheap waitress in the bathroom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d he says, grinning.</p><p>I shake my head, laughing. I\u2019ve known this guy nearly ten years, and even now, he still never ceases to surprise me.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how you do it,\u201d Denny says.</p><p>\u201cDen, has it been that long since your dick saw action that you\u2019ve forgotten how to use it?\u201d Tom takes a slug of his whiskey. \u201cDo I have to get that waitress I just banged over here to teach you the basics?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do remember I have a girlfriend? Anyway, you just said that waitress wasn\u2019t even that great. What the hell\u2019s she gonna teach me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, she wasn\u2019t bad. I\u2019ve had worse. And dude, you\u2019re in a long-distance relationship. Your dick needs daily action, and not just from your hand. Let me get that chick...\u201d Denny stops Tom\u2019s waving hand, the one trying to get the waitress\u2019s attention.</p><p>\u201cSeriously, man, sloppy seconds are not my thing.\u201d Denny shakes his head, grinning at him. \u201cAnd I\u2019m pretty sure she\u2019s had her fill from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe did. Best fuck of her life.\u201d He gives a self-satisfied grin. \u201cEven if it was just mediocre for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe had the time of her life in fifteen minutes?\u201d I raise my eyebrow, picking up my tequila.</p><p>\u201cYep. My dick has magical powers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should get \u2018Rub the Lamp\u2019 tattooed above your dick.\u201d Denny grins, throwing back his second shot.</p><p>Tom\u2019s face lights up.</p><p>I\u2019ve seen that look before. The last time Tom looked like that, I ended up in bed with three strippers.</p><p>\u201cI was kidding!\u201d Denny raises a protesting hand.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s probably the best idea you\u2019ve had since you suggested I get my tongue pierced.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was kidding then as well!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that was a fuckin\u2019 brilliant idea, Den! The women love it, especially when I\u2019m giving them head. Right, I\u2019m definitely on for this tattoo. Come on, we\u2019ll blow this place, find a tattoo joint, get inked, and then hit another club.\u201d Tom picks up his two sitting tequila shots and downs them, slamming the glasses on the table.</p><p>I throw mine back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not getting another tattoo done,\u201d Denny says, getting to his feet.</p><p>\u201cCome on, man,\u201d I say, throwing my arm around his shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m up for getting one done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re getting another?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>And I know just exactly what I\u2019m having done.</p><p>Standing, I throw a couple of hundreds down on the table to cover the bill and tip, gesturing for Dave to let him know we\u2019re leaving. I pick up the bottle of Jack to take with us. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>We load into the car. \u201cWhere to?\u201d Dave asks me.</p><p>\u201cShamrock\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re getting inked,\u201d Tom says from the back. \u201cI\u2019m getting \u2018Rub the Lamp\u2019 above my cock.\u201d</p><p>Dave gives me a raised eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ask,\u201d I say, shaking my head, laughing.</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t gonna.\u201d Dave pulls out into traffic, heading for Sunset Boulevard.</p><p>\u201cAh fuck! My jeans keep rubbing against it. It\u2019s hurting like a motherfucker!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should learn to wear underwear, then, fuck-face,\u201d Denny replies. Tom is in the backseat, rearranging his pants around his new tattoo.</p><p>\u201cNo fuckin\u2019 way! I\u2019m not caging the beast up. I might take my jeans off.\u201d He reaches to undo them.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you fuckin\u2019 dare!\u201d Denny yells. \u201cI\u2019m not sitting back here with you bare-assed!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m in pain,\u201d Tom moans.</p><p>\u201cTough. You are not getting your cock out while you\u2019re back here with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop being ridiculous. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m gonna try and fuck you. Not unless you ask nicely.\u201d He laughs.</p><p>\u201cCan we swap seats?\u201d Den asks me.</p><p>\u201cNo fucking way! He\u2019s all yours. I still can\u2019t believe you got that tattooed above your dick,\u201d I say to Tom. \u201cYou\u2019re officially a fuckin\u2019 idiot, you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, the women will love it!\u201d He grins. \u201cAnyway, soft cock, why won\u2019t you let us see your tattoo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s not meant for your eyes, fuck-wad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh fuck! You didn\u2019t get \u2018Tru\u2019s bitch\u2019 tattooed on yourself, did ya?\u201d</p><p>Denny snorts.</p><p>\u201cNo, I fuckin\u2019 didn\u2019t.\u201d Even I can hear the defensiveness in my tone.</p><p>\u201cYou so fuckin\u2019 did!\u201d Tom says, leaning forward. \u201cYou got yourself branded with your chick\u2019s name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you really?\u201d Denny says, joining him.</p><p>\u201cMight have,\u201d I say with a shrug.</p> <p>\u201cThere is officially no fuckin\u2019 hope for you.\u201d Tom sighs, falling back against his seat, opening his pants to reveal the gauze covering his tattoo. He takes a drink of the last remaining Jack from the bottle. We drank most of it in the shop. \u201cYou are officially turning into a woman. Next thing I\u2019ll hear, you\u2019ll be baking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck off! Just \u2019cause I got my girl\u2019s name tattooed on me, doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m whipped. I just kinda love her.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m officially hammered if I\u2019m admitting shit like this to Tom.</p><p>\u201cOh God. Hold my hair back, Den, while I hurl.\u201d Tom sticks his fingers in his mouth and rubs his shaved head with his other hand.</p><p>Even I can\u2019t not laugh.</p><p>\u201cCut him some slack. We all have to grow up one day and fall in love, Tom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot me. I\u2019ll be riding a different pussy every night of the week \u2019til the day I die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of them will catch you soon, man, and then you won\u2019t know what fuckin\u2019 hit you,\u201d Denny says.</p><p>He\u2019s right about that. Except Tru caught me a long time ago. I just wasted too much time screwing around before I tried to get her back.</p><p>\u201cWhere to now?\u201d Tom asks.</p><p>\u201cHome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck, that! It\u2019s still early, and I need more alcohol to numb the pain of my tattoo and the fact that both my boys are whipped good and proper.\u201d</p><p>Looking at Dave, I say, \u201cTake us to the next decent bar you see.\u201d</p><p>I let myself in, trying to be quiet so as not to wake Tru. The house is in complete darkness.</p><p>Staggering around, I make for our bedroom, pulling my T-shirt off as I do, careful of my new tattoo. Tossing the shirt aside, I stumble into our bedroom, trying hard not to make a sound. When I see my girl asleep in bed, she stops me in my tracks.</p><p>She\u2019s wearing a satin nightgown, the pale pink one that I like with the lace on the hem. She\u2019s got the sheets kicked back, and the nightgown has ridden up her thighs.</p><p>She\u2019s so fucking beautiful. And she looks so very fucking sexy.</p><p>Her hair is all mussed up, spread across the pillow. Inch upon inch of her soft olive skin on show, just waiting for me.</p><p>My dick instantly hardens.</p><p>I need to taste her. Be inside her. I hate to wake her, but not enough that I\u2019m not going to. I\u2019ve got a raging hard-on the size of Texas, and it\u2019s going nowhere until my girl has seen to it.</p><p>She loves midnight sex, and she has been really horny lately. Even more so than normal. Not that I\u2019m complaining. When Tru is eager for the snake, you\u2019ll hear no complaints from me.</p><p>Shucking out of my jeans and boxers, I kick them aside and climb up the foot of the bed.</p><p>Starting at her ankle, I run my hand up her smooth skin and keep going until I reach her thigh.</p><p>Stirring, she groans and rolls onto her back. \u201cHey, baby,\u201d she says, sounding sleepy.</p><p>My dick gets even harder at the sound of her voice.</p><p>She fucking owns me, completely.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I reply, kissing her shoulder, grazing my teeth over her skin, my hand still moving higher.</p><p>\u201cYou have a good night?\u201d she murmurs, but I can hear the sex in her voice. She\u2019s so fucking responsive, and always so ready for me.</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d I reply.</p><p>My fingers find her pussy, wet and waiting. No panties. God, she is so fucking hot.</p><p>\u201cAnd it just got a whole lot better,\u201d I whisper in her ear.</p><p>She sucks in a breath when my finger rubs over her clit.</p><p>I push a finger inside her while I keep working on her swollen bud.</p><p>She\u2019s so tight. The way she clenches around my finger, I know she\u2019s desperate to be fucked by me. About as desperate as I am to fuck her.</p><p>\u201cI missed you,\u201d she whispers, her hand reaching for my cock.</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d I wince when her fingers graze over my stomach, catching the gauze.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d she asks, sounding worried. Sitting up, she turns the bedside lamp on.</p><p>Her eyes hit my stomach. \u201cWhat the hell happened?\u201d Her eyes are wide. \u201cDid you get into a fight? Jesus Christ, Jake.\u201d She leans in closer to look at it, her fingers reaching, wanting to touch.</p><p>\u201cNo, baby, it\u2019s nothing like that. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><p>Fuck, I feel really nervous now. What if she thinks I\u2019m a dumb fuck for getting it done?</p><p>Raising her eyebrow, she says, \u201cYou have gauze covering your stomach and you\u2019re telling me not to worry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got a tattoo.\u201d I smile awkwardly.</p><p>\u201cYou did?\u201d She looks confused. \u201cYou never said you were thinking of getting another one done.\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about it for a while as a surprise for you. Getting it done tonight was more of a spur-of-the-moment thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got a tattoo, drunk?\u201d She raises her eyebrows.</p><p>God, she looks so fucking sexy right now. Hair all tousled, falling over her shoulders. The strap on her nightgown hangs low, her tits nearly falling out of it, practically begging me to release and suck on them.</p><p>I\u2019m just about to throw her down and screw her senseless, tattoo forgotten, when she says, \u201cCan I see it?\u201d</p><p>I hesitate.</p><p>She glances up at me.</p><p>\u201cAre you blushing, Jake Wethers?\u201d She touches my cheek with her fingers.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say, defensive.</p><p>I so totally fucking am. My face is as red as a fucking beet. Jesus Christ! What does she do to me?</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you want to show me it?\u201d she asks softly.</p><p>\u201cI do. I just...look, I know I should have probably spoken to you about it before, but it just seemed like a good idea at the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you stop talking and just show me the bloody tattoo? I\u2019m all intrigued now.\u201d</p><p>Sucking in a breath, I take the corner of the gauze and lift it. I peel it back, revealing the tattoo.</p><p>I hear her sharp intake of breath, and I risk a glance at her face.</p><p>Her hand is covering her mouth, her eyes wide, as she lets out a small laugh. \u201cYou had my name tattooed on you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKinda,\u201d I say, scrunching my face, looking down at it.</p><p>Tru Love</p><p>It\u2019s across my stomach in arched script. God, I\u2019m such a lame fucker.</p><p>\u201cYou hate it. It\u2019s lame, I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She cups her hands around my face. \u201cI love it. I love you. Jake Wethers, you are the sweetest man I\u2019ve ever known.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to be sweet,\u201d I groan. \u201cI want to be hard and hot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019re definitely those too.\u201d</p><p>She kisses me, gentle at first, and then her kisses deepen. I part my lips, and her sexy little tongue slips into my mouth.</p><p>I grab a handful of her hair, holding her to me, and meet her tongue with mine, stroking it.</p><p>\u201cCan you still...fool around?\u201d she says into my mouth.</p><p>\u201cSweetheart.\u201d I grab her ass, hard. \u201cIt\u2019ll take more than a tattoo to stop me from getting inside you. Death, maybe.\u201d</p><p>She giggles in my mouth, which pulses all the way down to my dick, and it throbs in response.</p><p>\u201cI suppose I should go on top. Can\u2019t have you in pain, can I?\u201d</p><p>I stare down at her. She\u2019s biting those sexy plump lips of hers, and I have the urge to bite them myself\u2014and a whole lot more. Then she pushes me down on the bed and straddles my hips.</p><p>I feel her wet pussy against my dick, and it feels so fucking good. She shifts, and starts to move up and down against it, creating friction, rubbing her sweet self all over me.</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ,\u201d I groan. \u201cYou are so fuckin\u2019 sexy. You keep doing that and I\u2019m gonna shoot my load any second.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t have that,\u201d she says, slowing. \u201cYou want me to get that ice cream?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLater, baby.\u201d I\u2019m practically salivating. \u201cRight now I just need to be inside you.\u201d</p><p>Smiling that sexy smile of hers, she rises up on her knees. Taking hold of my dick, she positions it at the head of her entrance.</p><p>She slides down onto me with a gentle moan, and I swear to God, I enter a state of nirvana for a moment.</p><p>I\u2019ve never felt anything like her before. I\u2019ll never get used to how fucking amazing she feels around me. She was made to fit me.</p><p>I stare up at her, watching as she pulls her nightgown off over her head, her long hair loose down her body, looking so fucking incredibly beautiful, and I wonder how the fuck I got so lucky.</p><p>She\u2019s the girl of my dreams, and more.</p><p>Glancing down, she looks at my tattoo and grins. \u201cTru love, eh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn fucking right,\u201d I growl. \u201cNow love my cock, will you, sweetheart, before I die a death here?\u201d</p><p>Grinning, she rises up on her knees, then slowly slides back down my length.</p><p>\u201cYou know I like to play slow, but right now, I need you to ride me good and hard, because you look way too fuckin\u2019 hot up there to hold out.\u201d</p><p>She looks for somewhere to rest her hands for support, so I offer her my hands.</p><p>Lacing our fingers together, my girl starts to move up and down, riding my cock fast, and I\u2019m so close to coming it\u2019s ridiculous, but I need to get her off first. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Freeing a hand from hers, she drops it down onto my chest and keeps going.</p><p>Putting two fingers together, I offer them to her mouth.

Then she\u2019s crying out in a string of Spanish, and I\u2019m a fucking goner.</p><p>I come inside her, hot and hard, spurting everything I have, while she tightens around my dick, squeezing it.</p> <p>When she\u2019s done, she falls forward, head on my chest, but keeps her back arched up, keeping her stomach from touching my tattoo.</p><p>After a moment, she moves off me, and my dick slips out, falling heavy against my stomach.</p><p>Fuck, I needed her.</p><p>Tru reaches over and turns the lamp off, and then snuggles up to my side.</p><p>I put my arms around her, pulling her closer.

I just wish I was there tomorrow morning to see his reaction when he wakes up and sees it sober.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Denny?

Another beautiful day. Along with the shopping, I\u2019ve discovered an additional perk to living in LA\u2014the sun is pretty much always shining, even in November.</p><p>I head into the kitchen, scoop some coffee into the coffeemaker, fill it with water, and turn it on.</p><p>I grab a chocolate biscuit out of the jar and lean against the counter, nibbling it while I wait for the coffee.</p><p>I see the pile of pizza boxes on the counter near the sink that I had asked Jake to take out to the bin after the guys left last night. He\u2019s such a lazy bum.</p><p>We had Tom, Denny, and Stuart over for dinner. Well, saying we had dinner may be glamming it up a bit.</p><p>We ordered pizza and ate in the living room while the guys watched football. As expected, I was ignored for the TV, and I ended up bringing my laptop through and sitting at the table, Skyping with Simone, until Denny butted in.</p><p>He\u2019s flying to London to see her. I wish I were going. I\u2019ve been thinking of asking Jake when he can next take some time off work so I can visit my folks and London and see Vicky and Simone. I know things are busy for him at the moment. He\u2019s spending a lot of time in the studio recording new stuff, which is great.</p><p>This is their first time recording an album without Jonny.</p><p>Jake seems to be doing okay with it. If he\u2019s not, then he\u2019s hiding it really well.</p><p>I pick up the boxes and take them through the utility and out the side door.</p><p>The warm California air embraces me.</p><p>I might bring my laptop outside and work on the patio today. My column is due in three days, and I haven\u2019t come up with anything yet. Last-minute, that\u2019s me.</p><p>I finish breaking the boxes down and push them in the bin, then head back inside.</p><p>The coffee is just finishing when I get back. I get two cups out of the cupboard and reach for the milk in the fridge.</p><p>Realising I haven\u2019t bought any recently, I check the date on it: 3 November.</p><p>I check the calendar pinned to the wall: 2 November. Still good for today.</p><p>I unscrew the cap and I\u2019m just about to pour the milk, when it dawns on me.</p><p>Setting the milk down, I step back and look at the calendar again.</p><p>Today is the second. Next to the second, marked on the third, is \u201cstart pill.\u201d That\u2019s my reminder to start my contraceptive pill after my break.</p><p>The break in which I have my period.</p><p>The period that hasn\u2019t started.</p><p>I step back from the calendar.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>My chest starts to tighten. My head starts to buzz.</p><p>No, it\u2019ll be fine. I\u2019ve just been under a lot of pressure lately, feeling stressed with one thing and another. That\u2019s what it is. That\u2019s why I haven\u2019t started.</p><p>Going back to the counter, I attempt to pour milk into one of the cups, but my hand is shaking so badly I have to put it back down.</p><p>The tremors are running all the way down my body. My heart is beating so wildly, I can hear the pulse beating in my ears.</p><p>I rest my hands on the counter and close my eyes, taking a deep breath.</p><p>I\u2019ve never been late before. Never. The pill keeps me regular as clockwork.</p><p>I can\u2019t be pregnant.</p><p>I can\u2019t.</p><p>Jake doesn\u2019t want kids.</p><p>As if hearing my silent call, he walks into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cCan I take that coffee to go, baby? Zane just called; he needs my help with something at the label.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Forcing my body to work, I reach up for a thermo cup and fill it with coffee and milk, desperately trying to keep the tremor in my hand from showing.</p><p>Turning, I see Jake, perched on a stool, reading something on his phone.</p><p>I watch him for long moment.</p><p>I can\u2019t be pregnant. This can\u2019t be happening. Things are going so well between us. If I\u2019m pregnant, it will break us.</p><p>You can\u2019t have a baby when only one of you wants it.</p><p>He glances up at me, catching me staring. A sexy smile spreads on his face. \u201cYou enjoying the view?\u201d</p><p>Forcing a smile, I walk toward him. \u201cAs always.\u201d I put the cup down before him on the counter.</p><p>He catches hold of my retreating hand and pulls me into his embrace.</p><p>Nuzzling my neck, he says, \u201cI love the smell of me on you.\u201d</p><p>We had sex first thing this morning. We always have sex. And I\u2019m pregnant. Maybe. Possibly.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>\u201cI need a shower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d He chuckles.</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t mean it like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what you meant,\u201d he says, lifting his head to stare into my eyes.</p><p>I suddenly feel exposed. What if he can see it in my eyes. Closing them, I lean in and kiss his lips.</p><p>I\u2019m going to lose him when he finds out.</p><p>Don\u2019t panic until you know for certain.</p><p>Jake\u2019s hands start wandering, and I can feel his kiss deepening, his erection growing through his jeans.</p><p>Catching his hand on my ass, breaking the kiss, I say, \u201cI thought you needed to get to the label.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need you more,\u201d he growls, lips attacking my neck, hand going straight to my breasts.</p><p>I can\u2019t have sex right now. Anything but sex.</p><p>\u201cYou had me half an hour ago, and isn\u2019t Zane waiting for you?\u201d</p><p>He pauses and looks me in the eyes.</p><p>I never dissuade Jake from sex. Never. He\u2019ll know there\u2019s something wrong with me. But right now I can\u2019t find the will to care about that.</p><p>\u201cAm I wearing you out?\u201d he asks, softly, stroking his fingers along my jaw.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine.\u201d I smile. \u201cI like you wearing me out. I\u2019m just trying to be the level-headed one out of the two of us, and you\u2019ve got to get to work.\u201d</p><p>I move away from him under the pretence of getting my coffee. The truth is I can\u2019t even stomach the thought of drinking it. My stomach is roiling with fear.</p><p>I hold the cup in my hands, resting it against my chest.</p><p>Jake gets to his feet, picking up his to-go cup. \u201cDon\u2019t forget, we\u2019ve got dinner with Smith and Carly tonight.\u201d</p><p>Crap. That\u2019s the last thing I want to do tonight. Not with what I have on my mind.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d I smile. \u201cLooking forward to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019ll get on well with Carly. Be good for you to make some girlfriends here, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I say, smiling again.</p><p>These smiles feel so insincere, I\u2019m pretty sure my face is going to crack under the strain of them.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been talking to Tom and Denny these last few days,\u201d Jake says, coming around the counter, \u201cabout asking Smith to become a permanent member of TMS.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I say, totally taken by surprise. I never thought Jake would consider it. I\u2019m so happy he has.</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t replace Jonny, of course. But Tom and Den are on board with it. He\u2019s a great guy who fits in well with us, and I hate to lose him to another band.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs someone trying to poach him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that I know of, but he\u2019s making a name for himself in the music world now, so it\u2019s only a matter of time. What do you think?\u201d</p><p>He wants my opinion. I love that.</p><p>Walking to him, putting my arms around his waist, I say, \u201cI think it\u2019s a brilliant idea. Smith will be over the moon when you ask him.\u201d</p><p>Brushing my hair back, he tucks it behind my ear. \u201cYou don\u2019t think I\u2019m being disloyal to Jonny?\u201d</p><p>I see the downturn of his lips, and it makes my chest hurt.</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t. I don\u2019t think Jonny would either. You\u2019re doing what\u2019s best for the band. TMS meant everything to Jonny. He would want you guys to carry on, and do what you felt was right.\u201d</p><p>He closes his eyes briefly and presses a kiss to my forehead. \u201cI guess I\u2019ll speak to him today,\u201d he says against my skin.</p><p>\u201cSo we\u2019ll be celebrating tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he says yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll say yes.\u201d</p><p>Putting his fingers under my chin, tilting my head back, he presses a firm kiss to my lips.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be home at seven, so make sure you are well on your way to being ready. I know how long it takes you to get dressed for a night out.\u201d</p><p>I muster up the energy to give him a look.</p><p>He laughs. Making for the door, he looks over his shoulder at me. \u201cLater. Love you, beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove you too.\u201d</p><p>The instant he\u2019s gone, I sag back against the counter, gripping it for support.</p><p>What am I going to do if I\u2019m pregnant? A termination isn\u2019t even an option for me. But Jake won\u2019t want the baby. He\u2019ll say he does for me. Or maybe he won\u2019t. Maybe when reality hits, he\u2019ll realise just how much he doesn\u2019t want a baby and he\u2019ll leave me.</p><p>Oh God.</p><p>I need to know if I am pregnant. Today. Now. I can\u2019t keep running the maybes around in my head.</p><p>I\u2019m so overtaken with nervous energy and the need to know, I don\u2019t even bother to shower. I pull on a pair of jeans and a T-shirt.</p><p>I grab my sunglasses and one of Jake\u2019s baseball caps and put them on. I look a complete twat, but I don\u2019t want to get recognised buying a pregnancy test, so the twat look it is. Unfortunately, being Jake\u2019s wife-to-be gets me recognised a lot lately.</p><p>I grab my phone and handbag, the keys for Jake\u2019s other car, the Vanquish, and I head for the garage. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When I reach the gates, Henry, our on-site security, stops me to ask if I need accompaniment on my outing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just going for a drive.

Enjoy your drive, Ms. Bennett.\u201d Henry opens the gates, allowing me out.</p><p>I\u2019ve told him a million times to call me Tru. He still calls me Ms. Bennett every time.</p><p>I turn out onto the street and start driving toward the exit of the gated community.</p><p>I need to find a chemist (or drugstore, as they\u2019re called over here), but one that\u2019s not local. Too many people know we live around here.</p> <p>I start fiddling with the built-in satellite navigation, but unfortunately it doesn\u2019t offer the feature \u201chere\u2019s your local chemist to buy pregnancy tests at.\u201d I decide to drive until I spot one.</p><p>I end up driving for forty-five minutes before I find a chemist that\u2019s a decent distance from home.</p><p>I\u2019m in and out in a flash, thankfully unnoticed, thirty dollars lighter and three pregnancy tests heavier. One to find out. One to make sure. Another to make doubly sure.</p><p>I drop the bag on the passenger seat, fire up the car, and tap the address in for home.</p><p>For the whole drive, every time I catch a glimpse of the bag sitting on the seat beside me, it makes me want to throw up.</p><p>Once I\u2019m back in the safety of the house, I head straight for our en suite, clutching the bag to my chest like it\u2019s a bomb about to go off.</p> <p>That\u2019s probably quite an apt description, because if I am pregnant, I foresee explosions of the gigantic kind.</p><p>Locking the bathroom door behind me, I drop the toilet lid and sit down.</p><p>I pull a test from the bag.</p><p>Swallowing back a huge lump of fear, I stare down at it.</p><p>My future with Jake depends on what this will tell me.</p><p>Oh God.</p><p>Fear seeps into my bones like poison.</p><p>Deep breaths. It\u2019s going to be okay.</p> <p>With shaky fingers, I open the box. Briefing over the instructions, I tear the protective seal on the test and, thanking God that I need to pee right now, I do as it says and pee on the stick.</p><p>I put the cap back on the test and place it on the top of the toilet.</p><p>I wash my hands, then come back and kneel on the floor just in front of the toilet.</p><p>I pick up the instructions to read again.</p><p>Okay, so this is simple. Three minutes I have to wait and if I\u2019m pregnant it will read: \u201cPregnant.\u201d</p><p>If I\u2019m not: \u201cNot Pregnant.\u201d</p><p>Easy, right?</p><p>Well, no, not if I\u2019m pregnant. It\u2019ll be so far from easy, there won\u2019t be a word that exists to cover it.</p><p>How can my whole future ride on what the outcome of a tiny piece of plastic tells me?</p><p>It feels like it should be more epic than this. Especially if I am pregnant. Something so wonderfully and terribly life-altering as this should have a bigger moment than sitting alone on my bathroom floor, waiting for a little piece of plastic to tell me my future.</p><p>How am I going to tell Jake?</p><p>I just can\u2019t even begin to think how to broach the subject with him.</p><p>I squeeze my eyes shut. Don\u2019t think of that now. When you know, then think of it.</p><p>How long has it been? Two minutes, I think. I should have brought my phone in with me to time it.</p><p>Should I look now? It might be ready.</p><p>I rise up on my knees to take a look, but fear sits me straight back down.</p><p>I can\u2019t do this.</p><p>I drop my head in my hands.</p><p>I\u2019m just so fucking scared. I know I have to know, but I don\u2019t want to know.</p><p>No, come on, Tru. Woman up.</p><p>Taking a few deep breaths, figuring it must be three minutes by now, I close my eyes as I slowly get to my feet.</p><p>Okay, just open your eyes. Deep breath. One...two...three...</p><p>I flick my eyes open.</p><p>Pregnant</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>CHAPTER TEN</p><p>I\u2019m sitting by the pool on a lounger, lost in my painful thoughts, when I hear Jake\u2019s voice. \u201cI thought you\u2019d be getting ready for dinner.\u201d</p><p>Instantly tensing, I turn to see him with his shoulder leant against the wall, watching me.</p><p>He looks so beautiful. Achingly so. It makes my chest tighten and hurt so badly I feel like I can\u2019t breathe. Like I\u2019ll never be able to breathe right again.</p><p>\u201cSorry, I lost track of time,\u201d I murmur.</p><p>\u201cStaring out at LA?\u201d He smiles, with a forward tilt of his head.</p><p>\u201cSomething like that.\u201d I get to my feet.</p><p>\u201cHey, you okay?\u201d he asks, eyeing me as I approach.</p><p>No, I\u2019m pregnant with our baby, Jake.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I hear myself uttering.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t look fine.\u201d His eyes search mine. \u201cYou look...have you been crying?\u201d he asks, straightening up. \u201cHas something happened?\u201d</p><p>Yes. I\u2019m pregnant.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine. I just saw one of those starving-children-in-Africa commercials, and it had me in tears by the end,\u201d I say.</p><p>His head turns toward the blank screen of the television.</p><p>\u201cYou should donate to those charities,\u201d I say, trying to distract his quickly working mind.</p><p>\u201cAlready do.\u201d</p><p>How do I not already know this? Sometimes, I feel like I know everything and absolutely nothing about Jake.</p><p>His eyes meet mine. He looks nervous. Shy. I love shy Jake.</p><p>\u201cYou really are wonderful, you know.\u201d I stroke my fingertips gently down his cheek. \u201cYou should let everyone see this amazing, caring side of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby, this side of me is reserved for you only.\u201d</p><p>Overcome with love and fear, it\u2019s quick to consume me. I can feel it spreading across my face, I wrap my arms around him, hugging him tight, pressing my face into his chest.</p><p>Jake holds me equally as possessively, resting his cheek against my hair. \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re okay?\u201d he murmurs.</p><p>I nod, afraid to talk for fear of breaking down.</p><p>\u201cI hate to know you\u2019ve been crying here alone. I hate to think of you crying, period. No more sad commercials for you, okay?\u201d</p><p>I swallow past the pain engulfing me. \u201cNo.\u201d I shake my head gently.</p><p>\u201cI spoke with Smith today,\u201d he says, caressing my back with his fingers.</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d I lean back, looking into his face.</p><p>Holding my gaze, I see something shift in his eyes, and then he smiles and says, \u201cHe\u2019s in.\u201d</p><p>I know he\u2019s happy. But he\u2019s conflicted too. Feeling guilty because of Jonny.</p><p>I want to soothe his guilt in this moment, but I\u2019m afraid if I stay in his arms for a moment longer that I\u2019ll crack. And right now, just before we have plans for dinner, is definitely not the right time to tell him. We need time to talk this through, not a quick, By the way, Jake, I\u2019m pregnant. Let\u2019s go to dinner.</p><p>Later. I\u2019ll tell him later.</p><p>I release myself from his hold. \u201cGuess I better go get ready for dinner.\u201d</p><p>As I\u2019m about to leave, he catches my hand. \u201cTru, you would tell me if there was anything else bothering you, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d I say, swallowing past the lie.</p><p>I squeeze his hand, forcing a smile, then I walk into the living room, but I can feel Jake\u2019s eyes on me the whole time.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019re you having, baby?\u201d Jake asks.</p><p>Baby.</p><p>I\u2019m pregnant.</p><p>Oh God.</p><p>My worry and fear have grown exponentially as the night has progressed. Being alone earlier, knowing what I know, was hard enough. But being around Jake, holding the truth in, is killing me. I feel like I\u2019m lying to him every second I don\u2019t tell him I\u2019m pregnant.</p><p>I fear I\u2019ll just blurt the words out any moment now. Focus is the key.</p><p>I will tell Jake, I just need to find the right moment, and right now is not it.</p><p>I glance up to see the waiter standing at our table. \u201cOh, um, I\u2019ll have the mushroom ravioli, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you like wine with dinner?\u201d the waiter asks Jake.</p><p>\u201cWhich wine, sweetheart?\u201d Jake asks.</p><p>Crap. I can\u2019t drink. Not now that I\u2019m having a baby.</p><p>But I always have a drink with dinner when we eat out. He\u2019ll know something is off if I say no.</p><p>But then I think you are allowed a glass of wine every now and then when you\u2019re pregnant, aren\u2019t you?</p><p>Afraid to say no, for tipping him off, I say, \u201cSmith should choose. We are celebrating his acceptance into the band, after all. I\u2019m really glad you\u2019re an official part of TMS now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d Smith smiles. \u201cAs for the wine, anything with a high alcohol content works for me,\u201d he says to Jake.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have a bottle of the Montrachet,\u201d Jake orders.</p><p>\u201cGood choice.\u201d The waiter takes the menus from our table and departs.</p><p>\u201cI love your dress,\u201d Carly says to me over the table.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d I\u2019m wearing the Pucci print jersey dress I treated myself to on one of my shopping trips with Stuart. He picked it out for me. He has amazing taste. And I might as well get some wear out of it while I still have time.</p><p>I\u2019m pregnant. And I have to tell Jake.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>\u201cI love your dress too.\u201d I force a smile.</p><p>I actually do like her dress, I\u2019m just forcing all my smiles tonight.</p><p>Carly is wearing the Marc Jacobs Night Bird dress. I was eyeing it last week. It\u2019s gorgeous. But Stuart talked me out of it. He said my boobs would have looked more stacked than the New York skyline.</p><p>Looking at it on Carly, I know he was right. She\u2019s a little lighter than me in the chest department, and it suits her just right.</p><p>Oh God, don\u2019t a woman\u2019s boobs get bigger in pregnancy? Christ, they\u2019re big enough as it is.</p><p>I look over at Carly, with her lovely blonde hair, golden skin, and slim figure and remember how I always used to want to look like that growing up. I used to hate being the foreign-looking girl in a sea of blonde hair and blue eyes. Now I\u2019m comfortable with myself mainly because of Jake. Because of how he looks at me. The way he adores me with his eyes.</p><p>But not for much longer, because I\u2019m going to get fat and bloated, and Jake won\u2019t want me anymore.</p><p>I\u2019m going to lose him. He\u2019s going to leave me for some thin, blonde goddess who doesn\u2019t want to tie him down with kids.</p><p>Panic grips a strong hold of me.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re a writer, Tru?\u201d Carly asks.</p><p>\u201cThe best.\u201d Jake smiles, putting his arm around the back of my chair, fingers resting lightly on my shoulder.</p><p>I freeze under his touch. Thankfully he doesn\u2019t seem to notice.</p><p>Composing myself, I say, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t go that far, but yes, I write for a magazine. And I\u2019m currently writing a book.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, you\u2019re writing the band\u2019s bio from the tour. That must be kind of cool, writing about the guy you\u2019re living with. I guess you just need to remember to leave out the bad habits, like leaving the toilet seat up or wet towels on the bed.\u201d She raises an eyebrow in Smith\u2019s direction.</p><p>\u201cI try to remember.\u201d Smith raises his hands in defence. \u201cI just slip up every now and then.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cEvery damn day is more like it,\u201d she says, laughing. \u201cSix years married, reminding him more times than I care to mention, and the man still can\u2019t remember to hang his bath towel up! I\u2019m sure he just does it to drive me crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know me, darlin\u2019, I live to drive you crazy.\u201d Smith puts his arm around her neck. He pulls her to him and presses a kiss to the top of her head. Giggling, Carly chastises him with a hand to the chest for ruffling her hair.</p><p>Their love for each other is so obvious, it\u2019s infectious. I hope Jake and I are still that much in love six years into our marriage.</p><p>The thought escapes me, paining me, because I know when I tell Jake I\u2019m pregnant, we probably won\u2019t even have six more minutes together.</p> <p>Especially when I tell him I\u2019m keeping the baby.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just using all my notes from the tour,\u201d I say, answering her question. \u201cSo Jake\u2019s bad habits, like never cleaning out his stinky ashtray that he leaves out on the patio, are sure to be left out.\u201d I slide him a look.</p><p>\u201cYou just clean them so much better than I ever could, baby,\u201d he says, giving me a doe-eyed look.</p><p>It hits me right in the chest with a sharp twist, leaving me feeling breathless.</p><p>\u201cYeah, that works.\u201d I give him a mock-stern look, forcing my fa\u00e7ade back up.</p> <p>Jake gives me one of his sexy smiles, the ones that let him get away with anything, as he leans over and plants a kiss on my cheek. My skin burns long after his lips have left me.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you do for a living, Carly?\u201d I ask, putting my focus on her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an interior designer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBest damn interior designer California has,\u201d Smith says, proud.</p><p>\u201cDo you have your own company?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d She smiles. \u201cIt\u2019s small, but I do okay.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve just recently moved into a new house, and I could really use some help decorating it. If you\u2019re not too busy, I\u2019d love to hire you to help me. I haven\u2019t got a clue where to start. That\u2019s okay with you, isn\u2019t it?\u201d I ask Jake.</p><p>Why am I making plans to decorate?</p><p>I suppose the baby will need a nursery...</p><p>What the hell am I doing, getting all moony-eyed over this when I don\u2019t even know if Jake wants this baby? He won\u2019t, I know he won\u2019t. I remember the look on his face when the subject came up on the island.</p><p>\u201cOf course. I think it\u2019s a great idea,\u201d Jake answers, bringing me back to the present.</p><p>\u201cThen I would love to.\u201d Carly beams. \u201cHow about I come round to your house on Monday, and we can start from there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds great, I can\u2019t wait.\u201d If I\u2019m still living there, that is. I force another smile.</p><p>\u201cSo you guys have been married six years,\u201d I say, needing the subject change.</p> <p>\u201cYep, and together for ten,\u201d Carly answers. \u201cWe are the stereotypical high school sweethearts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe \u2018stereotypical\u2019 is pushing it a little far, darlin\u2019. I was the lame grungy emo kid, and she was the hot cheerleader,\u201d Smith explains. \u201cIt took me five years to get her to notice me; then, once I had her attention, I lured her in with my wit and charm, and we\u2019ve been together ever since.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was the persistence,\u201d she says, laughing. \u201cI figured a guy who had kept at it for that long must have some serious stamina.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it was my persistence and stamina, not my hot body and charm?\u201d Smith says, feigning shock.</p><p>\u201cNo, those are what got me to marry you.\u201d She grins at him.</p><p>As I watch them interact, it warms my unsteady heart, and I feel Jake take hold of my hand under the table. When I look at him, smiling, he smiles back, but there\u2019s something off about it.</p><p>Or maybe that\u2019s just my own paranoia setting in.</p><p>\u201cHave you guys set a date for the wedding?\u201d Carly asks.</p><p>\u201cJuly twenty-first,\u201d Jake answers, beating me to it.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s the planning going?\u201d she directs her question to me.</p><p>\u201cSlow,\u201d I say with a grimace. \u201cI just haven\u2019t got a clue how to get started. So far, I have some wedding magazines, some dresses highlighted as maybes, and a drafted guest list.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ve planned a wedding before, so if you need a hand at all, you let me know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might have to take you up on that offer.\u201d I smile.</p><p>\u201cJust call me interior designer and wedding planner extraordinaire,\u201d she jokes with a flourish.</p><p>I laugh.</p><p>It\u2019s easy to laugh when, for that moment, I\u2019ve forgotten I\u2019m pregnant. Then I remember I have our baby growing inside of me, and my mood drops like a rock in water.</p><p>The waiter comes over with the bottle of wine, and it\u2019s at that moment Jake brushes my hair back revealing the nape of my neck. Leaning over, he whispers into my ear, \u201cYou look so sexy. If I could, I\u2019d take you on this table right now. Dining table, later, at home?\u201d He moves back, staring at me. His eyes are dark and fixed.</p><p>I nod mutely, forcing another smile.</p><p>He presses a soft kiss to my lips and moves back in his seat, then starts talking to Smith.</p><p>He wants to make love tonight.</p><p>Of course he does. We have sex every night. And morning.</p><p>But I can\u2019t. Not with this on my mind.</p><p>I\u2019m going to have to tell him before we get home.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>We\u2019ve said our good-byes to Carly and Smith and have just gotten in the car when I blurt out, \u201cWe need to talk. And it\u2019s not something we can talk about at home.\u201d</p><p>Pausing before he starts the car, he turns his head to look at me, his face full of myriad questions. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>I know how important it is to Jake that our home remains untarnished by fights. And I feel this conversation isn\u2019t going to be a happy one.</p><p>\u201cJust because,\u201d I reply. \u201cIs there somewhere private we can go to talk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust because?\u201d He frowns. \u201cYou think that\u2019s a fuckin\u2019 answer, Tru?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about this in the car, Jake.\u201d I wrap my arms protectively around myself.</p><p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t want to talk about it at home. So I\u2019d say here is as good a place as any.\u201d He turns his body toward me, bending his knee to rest on the seat.</p><p>Shaking my head, I stare out the passenger window. I can feel the fear trembling through my body, the words clotting in my throat.</p><p>\u201cIs this what was up with you earlier? Why you were crying? What I\u2019ve felt simmering under the surface all night?\u201d</p><p>I feel my eyes swell with tears.</p><p>\u201cWill you fuckin\u2019 answer me?\u201d he demands. His tone is so sharp, it turns me to face him.</p><p>\u201cAre you leaving me?\u201d He looks in pure pain. It\u2019s like a blow across my face.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say in a rush. \u201cWhy would you think that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of the look on your face right now, Tru. You look like you\u2019re grieving. Like you\u2019ve lost something big. Everyone you love is safe and well, so the only thing you could be mourning right now is the death of our relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Jake, no.\u201d I shake my head. A tear rolls down my cheek, and I brush it away. \u201cI would never leave you. Never. But...you might leave me when I tell you what I have to tell you.\u201d I clasp my hands in my lap.</p><p>I see a mix of anger and pain flash across his face, tightening his beautiful features.</p><p>After a beat, he says, \u201cHave you\u2014\u201d He pauses. Turning from me, he grips the steering wheel, looking out the windshield. When he speaks, his voice is so low, so heartbreakingly low. \u201cWhat you have to tell me...if it\u2019ll break what we have right here, this love between us, then don\u2019t tell me. I don\u2019t want to know. I want you, Tru, and anything that could for one second make me feel like I don\u2019t...then...just don\u2019t tell me.\u201d</p><p>My heart shatters into a million tiny pieces. I know what he\u2019s thinking. I hate that he thinks that.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pregnant.\u201d The words fall from my lips. For a moment it feels like all the air has been sucked out of the car. My world pauses. I wait. Wait for him to say something. Anything.</p><p>But he doesn\u2019t.</p><p>And when he starts the engine, putting the car into drive, and pulls out onto the street, I feel my world slip from my grasp, bottoming me out hollow.</p><p>A tear escapes. A whole lot more want to follow, but I hold them back. Brushing the stray one away discreetly, I stare out the window.</p><p>It\u2019s a long fifteen-minute drive back home. In all that time, Jake says nothing and neither do I.</p><p>I feel a distance settling between us, widening with each passing minute, to the point where there may as well still be twelve years and an ocean between us.</p><p>Jake pulls up on the drive. I get out and slam the door.</p><p>I fumble to get my keys out of my clutch as I approach the front door. I wrap my fingers around them, shove them in the lock, and let myself in.</p><p>I slam this door too. I\u2019m angry and hurt that he\u2019s said nothing. I want him to know.</p><p>I take a step forward, and that\u2019s when I hear his car reversing out.</p><p>Moving quickly, I yank the door open and catch sight of the taillights speeding back down the driveway.</p><p>Pain tears through me, so fierce that my legs buckle. I fall back against the wall, clutching my chest. I feel wide open. Broken. Devastated.</p><p>He\u2019s left.</p><p>Hot tears sting my eyes like pokers.</p><p>Don\u2019t cry, Tru. Keep it together.</p><p>I press my palms to my eyes, forcing the tears back.</p><p>He\u2019s supposed to love me. So much so that when he thought I had cheated on him he didn\u2019t want to know.</p><p>But I tell him I\u2019m pregnant and he hotfoots it out of here like his ass is on fire, without so much as a word.</p><p>Bastard. Motherfucking bastard.</p><p>Then I get angry. Really fucking angry.</p><p>Fine, he doesn\u2019t want this baby. Then I don\u2019t want his sorry ass.</p><p>I march to our bedroom. I grab one of Jake\u2019s holdalls and some jeans, T-shirts, pyjamas, and underwear. I stuff them in the bag.</p><p>I get my passport from the safe in our walk-in wardrobe. I get my phone from my clutch.</p><p>I need a cab.</p><p>I do a quick web search for local cab companies on my phone and call the first one that comes up.</p><p>They tell me it\u2019ll be fifteen minutes for the cab.</p><p>I go to the foyer, take the handset off the wall, and dial through to the main gate to let them know I have a cab coming.</p><p>Ready to leave, I stand a moment, holdall at my feet, handbag on my shoulder.</p><p>I\u2019m not really sure what I\u2019m doing right now.</p><p>Twisting my engagement ring on my finger, I pause. I lift my hand to look at it.</p><p>\u201cTrudy Bennett, I love you beyond any lyrics I could ever write or any words I could ever say. I always have, and I always will. Marry me?\u201d</p><p>A tear slides down my cheek, and I pull my engagement ring off.</p><p>Taking a slow walk back to our bedroom, I place the ring on Jake\u2019s pillow.</p><p>Then I head straight to the foyer, pick up the holdall, swing it over my shoulder, and let myself out into the warm California night.</p><p>I lock the front door, and keeping the keys in my hand, start the walk down the long driveway.</p><p>Jackson, one of the night security guards, jumps out of the booth when he sees me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMs. Bennett, is everything okay?\u201d I see his eyes go to the holdall on my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cCould you give these to Jake when he gets back, please?\u201d I hold out the keys.</p><p>His eyes flicker to them, then back to my face. \u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want to keep hold of them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I shake my head. \u201cI won\u2019t be needing them anymore.\u201d</p> <p>Reluctantly, he takes them from me.</p><p>I start to walk toward the gates, when he says, \u201cIf you need driven somewhere, Parker can take you wherever you want to go.\u201d He thumbs back to Parker, the other security guard, who is standing by the door, watching our interaction.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay.

With my baby.</p><p>But she\u2019s on the pill. How can she be pregnant?</p><p>Jesus fucking Christ. She\u2019s pregnant. With my baby.</p><p>I can\u2019t be a dad. I\u2019m not dad material.</p><p>I get a smoke out of the pack and realise my hands are shaking.</p><p>I clench my hands into fists, trying to ease the tremors. I put a cigarette between my lips, light it, and take a long, slow drag.</p><p>Lowering the window, I blow the smoke out into the night, and stare out at LA.</p><p>The last time I was parked here, I was seeing to Tru on the hood of my car, and now I\u2019m here after finding out I\u2019m going to be a dad.</p> <p>Fuck.</p><p>I know without a doubt that Tru will want the baby. An abortion won\u2019t be an option for her.</p><p>Now I feel like the worst kind of bastard for even thinking it. Thinking of getting rid of a part of myself and Tru.</p><p>But what the fuck do I know about being a dad? Nothing. I know absolutely nothing. I didn\u2019t exactly have the best teacher growing up.

Still taunting me.</p><p>I need to drown the dead motherfucker out.</p><p>I turn the music on, quickly search through to Linkin Park, and press Play on \u201cNumb.\u201d I crank it up loud, until the song bleeds through every sense.</p><p>I always listen to this song when I need to clear my mind. My drug counsellor said to find something to focus on when I feel like everything is slipping away from me. Music is my life, aside from Tru, so I took to this song.</p><p>I know this might seem an odd song to calm me, but it works. \u201cNumb\u201d is my comedown song.</p><p>I can feel my anger and frustrations already beginning to ebb.</p><p>Numb is exactly how I need to feel right now. I don\u2019t want to think. I don\u2019t want to feel. Because if I do, I\u2019ll be turning this car around and heading in the wrong direction, straight to a dealer.</p><p>Resting back in my seat, I take another long pull on my smoke, flicking the ash out the window.</p><p>I\u2019m going to be a dad.</p><p>I don\u2019t know how to be a dad. I want to be...for Tru. I want to be everything right for her. But I don\u2019t know if I can. I\u2019ll fuck it up. I fuck everything up.</p><p>The thought of screwing up something as important as having a kid terrifies me beyond words.</p><p>I can\u2019t be him. I can\u2019t be Paul. And I have been, for a very long time.</p><p>I would never raise my hand to a woman or a child. Never. But what if we had a kid and something just snapped inside of me and changed me into the bastard he was? It doesn\u2019t take just fists to hurt and break a kid. Words do some serious fucking damage too.</p><p>I know that all too well.</p><p>And I\u2019m like him in so many ways. Too many ways. What\u2019s to say that I won\u2019t morph into the full shithole of a package that was Paul Wethers once my kid is born?</p><p>I might be successful professionally, but behind that fa\u00e7ade, I\u2019m a whole lot of fucked up and broken. Tru is the glue that holds me together, and look what I just did to her. She is my whole world. She told me she was pregnant and I just walked away from her. I left her all alone.</p><p>What type of man does that? A fucking coward, that\u2019s what.</p><p>God, when she told me she was pregnant, she sounded so scared. I could hear it in her voice. Almost like she knew what I\u2019d do. That I\u2019d run away. That I\u2019d fuck up.</p><p>Didn\u2019t I do that so very fucking spectacularly?</p><p>It\u2019s no excuse, but I panicked. When she said she was pregnant, it was like a fuse went in my head and I couldn\u2019t think straight. For the whole ride home, I felt robotic.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t think or focus on anything.</p><p>It was just...Drive the car, Jake.</p><p>Get home, Jake.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t get any farther than that. When she got out of the car, I knew she was angry and hurting, but I was frozen to my seat.</p><p>I was telling myself to get out of the car, to follow her, to talk to her, but I literally couldn\u2019t make my body move.</p><p>The next thing I knew, the car was in reverse, and I was spinning it around, driving out of there.</p><p>I was just so fucking terrified. I\u2019m still terrified.</p><p>Tru is carrying my baby inside of her, and I left them both behind.</p><p>I walked away.</p><p>I am him.</p><p>I\u2019m the legacy he left behind. He got exactly what he wanted. He wanted me just as screwed up\u2014no, more screwed up\u2014than he was.</p><p>Well, cheers, Dad. You did a top-notch fucking job.</p><p>Taking one last drag of my smoke, I flick my cigarette butt out the window.</p><p>I\u2019ll never be good enough for Tru or the baby. But I want to be.</p><p>I know the baby will be perfect and beautiful, because Tru is. It\u2019ll take after her, because it has to. I don\u2019t want an ounce of my fucked-up-ness in our baby.</p><p>Our baby.</p><p>We\u2019re having a baby. It\u2019s growing inside of her right now. A tiny baby, made from me and Tru. It\u2019ll be so small...so tiny, with a little heart beating in its chest.</p><p>It\u2019ll need protecting, keeping safe for its whole life.</p><p>And it\u2019s mine to protect.</p><p>I\u2019m going to be a dad.</p><p>Out of nowhere, I feel a tiny lift in my heart at the thought. A tiny flicker of hope buried deep inside my fractured, fucked-up soul.</p><p>Then the realisation slaps me across the face.</p><p>I\u2019ve so completely fucked up. She\u2019s never going to forgive me for this.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>I need to go back. I need to talk to her. Beg her to forgive me. Tell her I\u2019ll make it work somehow. I\u2019ll figure something out. I\u2019ll figure out how to be a dad to our baby. I want to be the man she believes I can be. I will do anything for her.</p><p>I can\u2019t lose Tru. She\u2019s my reason for being. She\u2019s my everything.</p><p>And I want to be the same for our baby.</p><p>I\u2019m just about to fire up the car when my cell starts to ring.</p><p>I glance at the screen and see it\u2019s home security.</p><p>Tru.</p><p>Fuck, no.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Wethers. It\u2019s Jackson. I, um, I just thought you might want to know that Ms. Bennett just left in a cab. She had luggage, and she, um, left her house keys with me to give to you.\u201d</p><p>My heart drops through my stomach.</p><p>God, no.</p><p>\u201cYou just let her leave?\u201d I say through gritted teeth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, sir. I tried to talk to her, offered to drive her wherever she was going, but she wouldn\u2019t have it.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s Tru. Stubborn to a fault.</p><p>\u201cDo you know where she was going?\u201d I ask through my dry mouth.</p><p>\u201cNo, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFind out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you see which cab company it was that picked her up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen fuckin\u2019 call them and find out where the driver is taking her! How long ago did she leave?\u201d I drive my hand through my hair.</p><p>\u201cThe cab pulled away less than a minute ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall them now. Then call me straight back.\u201d</p><p>I hang up.</p><p>She left. I have no one to blame but myself. I have so totally and monumentally screwed everything up.</p><p>Fucking idiot, I\u2019m such a complete and total fucking idiot.</p><p>I have to make this right. I have to bring her home. Bring them both home.</p><p>I speed-dial Tru\u2019s cell.</p><p>It\u2019s ringing.</p><p>Pick up, baby, please.</p><p>After three rings, it diverts to voice mail.</p><p>She cut me off.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>I press redial.</p><p>Voice mail.</p><p>Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.</p><p>I wait for the tone to leave a message. \u201cSweetheart, I\u2019m so sorry. I screwed up, I know, but don\u2019t leave. Call me back, please. We can talk and sort this out. I shouldn\u2019t have left when I did. I shouldn\u2019t have left you like that. I just panicked. I\u2019m not strong like you, baby. It\u2019s no excuse, I know, but please don\u2019t leave.\u201d I exhale. \u201cI just...I love you so fuckin\u2019 much.\u201d</p><p>I can feel my throat tightening, so I hang the call up before I start crying.</p><p>I get out another smoke and light it up and sit and stare at my cell.</p><p>Call me back, baby, please.</p><p>A minute later, my cell starts to ring, but it\u2019s not her. It\u2019s security.</p><p>\u201cWhere is she going?\u201d I ask in a clipped voice.</p><p>\u201cLAX, sir.\u201d</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>I slam the car into drive and, spinning it around, I put the pedal to the floor, desperate to get to LAX and stop the only woman I\u2019ve ever loved from leaving me and taking my baby with her.</p><p>TRU...</p><p>CHAPTER TWELVE</p><p>Adele starts to sing in my bag. I rifle through my bag to find my phone.</p><p>Jake.</p><p>My heart thumps in my chest as I stare at his name on the screen.</p><p>He left me. He just drove away and left me.</p><p>The pain, rejection, and humiliation all clusters together and burns straight through my heart.</p><p>I reject his call and switch off my phone.</p><p>\u201cHow much longer to the airport?\u201d I ask the driver.</p><p>\u201cAbout fifteen minutes.\u201d</p><p>I rest back in my seat. I don\u2019t even know when the next flight back to the UK is. I didn\u2019t plan that far ahead. I didn\u2019t plan this at all.</p><p>I\u2019ll just have to wait it out at the airport until I can get the next flight out of this godforsaken place.</p><p>I expected Jake to react badly to the news of my pregnancy. I expected a fight. What I didn\u2019t expect was for him to not say a word the moment I told him, then drive away the instant he got me out of the car. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Just thinking of it makes my chest hurt again. I cross my arms, trying to compress the pain.</p><p>\u201cNice place you were coming from back there,\u201d the driver says.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I reply, not wanting to get pulled into a conversation with him.</p><p>\u201cWorth a lot of bucks, those houses. You live there?\u201d</p> <p>He keeps flicking glances at me in the rearview mirror.</p><p>Oh God, I hope he doesn\u2019t recognise me.</p><p>\u201cNo. I was just visiting.\u201d I turn my face away to stare out the window, letting him know I\u2019m in no mood to talk.</p><p>Thankfully he gets the message.</p><p>Fifteen minutes later, I see the huge LAX sign. I\u2019m so absolutely ready to get out of this cab and out of this goddamn city.</p> <p>I just want to go home. I want my mama and daddy.</p><p>God, I can\u2019t even begin to think how Mama will react when I tell her I\u2019m pregnant and that Jake doesn\u2019t want the baby. My dad will go ape. He\u2019ll probably fly out here just so he can kick Jake into next week.</p><p>Crap.</p><p>This is all such a bloody mess.</p><p>\u201cHow much?\u201d I ask when the driver pulls to the curb.</p><p>\u201cSeventy-five bucks.\u201d</p> <p>Bloody hell. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s taking me for a ride, but I can\u2019t be arsed to argue the point.</p><p>I pull two fifties out of my purse and tell him to keep the change. I know the fucker is ripping me off already, but I just want out of this cab, not to sit around waiting for change.</p><p>I climb out, wobbling on my heels, with the holdall on one shoulder and handbag on the other.</p><p>Glancing at the entrance, I take a deep breath.</p><p>Securing the strap on my shoulder, I walk toward the doors.</p><p>I hear the screeching tires of a car. Turning, I see the James Bond car pulling to a stop in the middle of the road. The driver\u2019s door flies open and Jake jumps out.</p><p>Horns beep as cars pull around his abandoned car, but he doesn\u2019t seem to care.</p><p>I see him scanning the area, and then he spots me, so I quickly turn on my heel and make for the door.</p> <p>\u201cTru, wait!\u201d he calls.</p><p>\u201cPiss off!\u201d I yell back.</p><p>I see people stopping to stare, and my face instantly flames.</p><p>I hear someone call out, \u201cHey, man, you can\u2019t leave your car there!\u201d</p><p>The next thing I know, Jake is in front of me, taking hold of my arms. \u201cJust wait. I\u2019m sorry, Tru. I\u2019m so fuckin\u2019 sorry. Don\u2019t leave. Just hear me out, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not interested in listening to a bloody thing you have to say!\u201d I yell.</p><p>Okay, so maybe I don\u2019t care too much that people are watching us right now. I guess I\u2019m too hurt and angry to care.</p><p>I can feel tears welling in my eyes, but I refuse to cry. \u201cI understood you loud and clear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI fucked up. I panicked and I ran, and I shouldn\u2019t have. I\u2019m sorry. Sorrier than I have ever been in my life.\u201d He shakes his head. Looking down, he blows out a breath. Lifting his head, he meets my eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s no excuse, Tru, but I just didn\u2019t know what to say or do. I couldn\u2019t think straight. I\u2019m so sorry, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me that!\u201d I cry at him, his words touching a raw nerve in me. \u201cI\u2019m not your fuckin\u2019 baby!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you are.\u201d His tone is so low, so intense, that all I can do is stare at him. \u201cYou will always be mine, Tru. Always.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, man, didn\u2019t you hear me? I said you can\u2019t just leave your car there!\u201d</p><p>I tear my gaze away from Jake to see an airport employee walking toward us. Young guy, early twenties.</p><p>He eyes Jake, stopping in his tracks. \u201cHey, aren\u2019t you...Jake Wethers?\u201d he squints at Jake. \u201cHoly fuck\u2014you are! It\u2019s you! Hey, it\u2019s Jake Wethers!\u201d he exclaims, gesturing to the people around, bringing all of their attention to us.</p><p>We\u2019re out here alone, without Dave and Ben, surrounded by about twenty people who now recognise Jake.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>I feel Jake tense, his grip tightening on my arms. He moves his eyes from me and says to the guy, \u201cI\u2019m not him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are,\u201d he says, stepping closer. \u201cI\u2019d recognise you anywhere! Been to all your shows, man. Got all your albums. I\u2019m one of your biggest fans! Fuckin\u2019 love your music! Holy fuck, I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re here! Wait \u2019til Marie hears this! My girlfriend\u2014she loves you almost as much as I do! When Jonny died, she cried for weeks. Oh man, I gotta get your autograph and a picture.\u201d He starts moving closer, reaching into his pocket.</p><p>I can\u2019t believe we\u2019re in the middle of an argument and some \u00fcberenthusiastic Jake fan wants an autograph and picture.</p><p>I hear the murmuring voices of the people around us, the excitement lifting their tones, and my heart starts to beat uneasily.</p><p>We\u2019re going to get mobbed.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going now,\u201d Jake orders in a quiet but firm voice, staring down at me.</p><p>I nod once, and then Jake grabs hold of my hand. As quick as lightning, we\u2019re moving toward his car.</p><p>I hear people following us, voices calling.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go, man!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSign my T-shirt!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I get a picture with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me give you my number!\u201d</p><p>Jake opens the passenger door and all but shoves me inside, closing it firmly behind me. I watch, uneasy, as he tries to manoeuvre his way to the driver side as people grab at him. Jake shoves people out of the way, the crowd suddenly much thicker than before.</p><p>Even if Jake wanted to stop and do autographs, the people are way too excited now, and there are way too many of them to control.</p><p>A person is rational. People are just plain crazy.</p><p>I\u2019m scared and shaking at the crowding around the car, trapping me in.</p><p>Then Jake\u2019s in the car. He revs the engine loudly in warning and pulls the car forward, getting us out of there.</p><p>Still trembling, I watch him make a call. He doesn\u2019t put it on speaker but drives while on his phone. He never does that.</p><p>\u201cThere was an incident at LAX...I\u2019ll tell you later...no, we got mobbed...yeah, we were arguing, people heard. It\u2019ll make the news for sure, clean it up best you can...she\u2019s fine, we\u2019re both fine...no, I\u2019m not being followed...I\u2019m heading home right now...okay.\u201d He hangs up. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d he asks.</p><p>I nod.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t run like that ever again. I know you\u2019re pissed with me right now, but it was a stupid thing to do.\u201d</p><p>Anger flashes through me. I let out a sharp laugh, turning in my seat to him. \u201cAre you fucking kidding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I look like I\u2019m fuckin\u2019 kidding?\u201d The look he gives me is harsh enough to make me shrink in my seat. \u201cYou could have gotten hurt out there,\u201d he says in a low voice. I\u2019m not sure, but I think I see a shudder run through him.</p><p>Then I get angry again.</p><p>I wouldn\u2019t have even been at the airport if he hadn\u2019t pulled a Houdini on me. This is all his bloody fault!</p><p>I shoot him a look of disgust. \u201cLike you would even care. This is all your fault!\u201d</p><p>One hand on the steering wheel, he turns his head, firing such a weighted look at me that I fear I may splinter into tiny pieces under the force of it. \u201cYou think I wouldn\u2019t care if something happened to you?\u201d His jaw is gripped tight.</p><p>I give him a hard stare back and shake my head no.</p><p>His face tightens. I can even see a vein pulsing in his neck. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen him so angry.</p><p>And it\u2019s me who he\u2019s angry with. Cheeky bastard.</p><p>That raises my hackles again. \u201cLet me out of this goddamn car,\u201d I demand through clenched teeth.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you just tell me no?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounded like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018Sounded like it\u2019! What the hell?\u201d I seethe. \u201cWho the bloody hell do you think you are? You\u2019re an arrogant twat, Jake Wethers! I\u2019m not one of your employees you can order around! God, you are just a big fat fucking arsehole!\u201d</p><p>And I\u2019m thirteen again, apparently.</p><p>\u201cI deserve that,\u201d he says. He actually looks like he\u2019s holding back a smile, which pisses me off even more. \u201cBut I can\u2019t let you out, Tru. It\u2019s not safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you gonna do? Hold me hostage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I have to.\u201d</p><p>He sounds so serious that I\u2019m not wholly sure he\u2019s kidding.</p><p>\u201cI fuckin\u2019 hate you,\u201d I hiss.</p><p>Shit, where did that come from?</p><p>I see a flash of pain across his face. It doesn\u2019t make me feel good. It makes me feel like a bitch.</p><p>\u201cI deserve that as well.\u201d He drags a hand through his hair. \u201cLook, just let me get you safely home. Then give me ten minutes of your time, listen to what I have to say, and if you still want to leave, I\u2019ll arrange for the jet to take you wherever you want to go. You just can\u2019t be out there moving around alone without security. It\u2019s not safe for you...or the baby.\u201d</p><p>I sharp in a breath at the mention of the baby. Tears spring to my eyes, and then a sob escapes me. I clamp my hand to my mouth.</p><p>\u201cTru...\u201d He reaches out to touch me.</p><p>I pull back from him. \u201cDon\u2019t touch me,\u201d I whisper, my words watery with the tears.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry...\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it!\u201d I snap. \u201cI don\u2019t need your fucking pity or sympathy. Just leave me alone.\u201d</p><p>Kicking off my shoes, I bring my feet up to rest on the edge of the seat. Wrapping my arms around my legs, I rest my cheek on my knee and stare out the window.</p><p>I hear his light exhalation of breath, but he doesn\u2019t make another attempt to speak to me.</p><p>I hear the quiet sound of Linkin Park fade out in the background. The next thing I hear is Snow Patrol\u2019s \u201cMake This Go on Forever.\u201d</p><p>Bastard.</p><p>Mother-crapping bastard.</p><p>I hate it when he does this. Plays a particular song to speak to me. To get my attention when I won\u2019t listen to him.</p><p>But all he\u2019s doing right now is just reminding me of how much he hurt me. How much he\u2019s still hurting me.</p><p>I\u2019m not playing his games. And I am most certainly not listening.</p><p>He can piss right off.</p><p>Lifting my weary head, I free an arm from around my leg and reach over and turn the music off.</p><p>Resuming my position, I spend the rest of the long, silent ride home trying to equal out the pain threatening to crush me to dust.</p><p>Jake pulls up on the drive outside our house and turns the engine off, leaving us with only the lights from the dash providing a small glow.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready to hear me out, or do you need more time?\u201d he asks quietly.</p><p>I lift my tired head and stare at him.</p><p>He looks torn and broken. I hate to see him this way. But I\u2019m feeling torn and broken right now too.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m listening,\u201d I whisper, putting my feet to the floor, not wholly sure I am ready to hear what he\u2019s got to say.</p><p>He turns his body toward me. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry for driving away and leaving you earlier.\u201d His voice is soft, tentative. \u201cMy behaviour was cruel and stupid. Tru, I need you to know I would never hurt you on purpose.\u201d He rubs his face roughly, driving his fingers into his hair. \u201cGod, the thought of you hurting\u2014knowing I caused it\u2014it\u2019s like a knife through my fuckin\u2019 heart.

God, Tru, the second you told me you were pregnant, my own childhood flashed before my eyes.\u201d He breathes in deeply. \u201cThat\u2019s why I ran: because of my own fears, not because I don\u2019t want you or the baby.\u201d</p><p>He wants the baby?</p><p>\u201cWhat are you terrified of?\u201d I ask quietly.</p> <p>\u201cThat I\u2019m not good enough to be a dad. That I\u2019ll screw it up. That I\u2019ll fuck everything up. That I\u2019ll turn our child into a fucked-up mess like I am. Just like my dad did to me.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m just about to speak, to protest, to tell him he\u2019s not a fuck-up, that he\u2019s not Paul, he never could be, when he speaks again.</p><p>\u201cBut while I sat there thinking about all the negatives, I realised something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich was?\u201d I\u2019m all but on the edge of my seat.</p><p>\u201cThat I have you,\u201d he says simply. \u201cWith you I know I can do it, because you\u2019re my strength, Tru. You make me want to be a better man, a good dad to our baby. The best. And I want to spend the rest of my life taking care of you both,\u201d I hear his voice break before he continues in a quieter tone. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be him, Tru. I don\u2019t ever want our kid to experience what I did growing up, and that\u2019s what will keep me straight. You\u2019ll both keep me straight.\u201d</p> <p>I see tears staining his cheeks, and my heart shatters.</p><p>I choke out a sob. Releasing my seat belt, I throw myself into his lap.</p><p>His arms grip me with a vice force, and he buries his face in my neck. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. Please forgive me for leaving you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. Of course I do. I\u2019m sorry I said I hated you. I don\u2019t. I never could. I was just hurting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight now, I\u2019d deserve it if you did hate me, but it would break me if you did.\u201d</p><p>Lifting his head, he looks at me, and the force of his gaze hits me straight in the heart.</p> <p>I trace his tears away with my fingertips and kiss over every inch of his face, moving slowly, until he catches my lips with his.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ever leave me again,\u201d he breathes against my mouth.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know I was at the airport?\u201d</p><p>Moving from me, he rests his head against the headrest. \u201cJackson called to tell me you\u2019d left in a cab, so I had him call the cab company to find out where they were taking you.\u201d</p><p>Ever resourceful. That\u2019s Jake.</p><p>I touch my hand to his face, running my fingers into his hair, gently twisting the ebony strands around the tips, and he closes his eyes, content.</p><p>Watching him, I hope that our baby looks just like him. I hope it has Jake\u2019s lovely features and beautiful blue eyes and my skin tone. But not my Puerto Rican\u2013size bum.</p><p>Then I feel doubt start to creep in again. What if he changes his mind once the baby arrives? I don\u2019t think I could bear his leaving then.</p> <p>\u201cJake,\u201d I murmur. He opens his eyes. \u201cAre you absolutely sure this is what you want? The baby, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d His gaze drops to my stomach. \u201cThis baby will be made of everything I have loved my whole life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna get fat,\u201d I mumble.</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re going to get even sexier.\u201d Coming close again, he wraps his arms around me tightly, rubbing the tip of his nose against mine. \u201cHow could I not want something made up of Trudy Wethers\u2019s DNA?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill Bennett.\u201d I grin. \u201cYou haven\u2019t made an honest woman of me yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ready to hop that plane to Vegas now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA shotgun wedding. My folks would be so proud.\u201d I laugh.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want to do about the wedding?\u201d he asks. \u201cMove it forward?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would give me a matter of weeks to plan it. Why don\u2019t we just wait until after the baby is born?\u201d</p><p>I see him quickly do the math in his head. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t be able to get married July twenty-first. You okay with that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to have a mini-Jake soon. Of course I\u2019m okay with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr a mini-Tru,\u201d he says. Then his expression suddenly changes. \u201cFuck, a girl. We might have to lock her up, Tru.\u201d</p><p>I scrunch up my face. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause, if she looks anything like you, I\u2019m one day going to be fighting off horny teenage boys left, right, and centre. I\u2019ll probably end up in jail for beating one to death if I find him with his hands on my baby girl.\u201d He shudders comically.</p><p>I let out a laugh. \u201cLet\u2019s hope if we have a boy, he\u2019s doesn\u2019t grow up to be one of those horny teenagers...or God forbid, as horny as you are. Otherwise we\u2019ll have some girl\u2019s dad round here kicking his ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll end up in jail for beating the shit out of the dad\u2014fuck, this is a no-win, sweetheart,\u201d he groans, dropping his head back against the rest. \u201cI\u2019m doomed to a future behind bars.\u201d</p><p>Laughing softly, I say, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, baby, we\u2019ll figure a way to keep you out of prison.\u201d I kiss the tip of his nose, then open the door, ready to get out of the car and into the house to bed.</p><p>Once inside, I head to the bedroom, grabbing a glass of water from the kitchen to take with me.</p><p>Smiling, feeling a million times happier than I did the last time I was here, I walk into our bedroom to find Jake still dressed and sitting on the edge of the bed, staring down at something in his hand. He doesn\u2019t look happy.</p><p>\u201cYou were really leaving me,\u201d he whispers.</p><p>My eyes go to his hand, and I see my engagement ring.</p><p>Crap.</p><p>My face prickles, shame burning it when I see how hasty I was in taking it off.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d I take a step toward him. \u201cI was angry, and I thought you didn\u2019t want the baby. I thought we didn\u2019t have a future anymore.\u201d</p><p>Jake gets to his feet. Coming over to me, he takes the glass from my hand and puts it down on the bedside cabinet.</p><p>He takes hold of my left hand. \u201cI can\u2019t promise I won\u2019t fuck up again, Tru. I\u2019ve tried and failed so many times. Just know that no matter what, I want you both very much.\u201d He slides the ring onto my finger. \u201cI will always want you.\u201d</p><p>Taking his face in my hands, I pull him down to me and kiss his lips gently.</p><p>He picks me up and carries me to the bed. Turning off the light, Jake lies beside me, pulling me to his side, arms tight around me.</p><p>We\u2019re both still dressed, but I sense that right now, Jake doesn\u2019t want to be an inch away from me, just like I don\u2019t from him.</p><p>In the dark, Jake\u2019s hand goes to my stomach, rough fingers tracing over the fabric of my dress. \u201cI love you,\u201d he whispers.</p><p>For the first time since we got together, I know that declaration isn\u2019t meant just for me. It gives me a flicker of hope that maybe, just maybe, things will be okay after all.</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTEEN</p><p>I wake in Jake\u2019s arms, still wearing last night\u2019s dress.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he says softly beside me.</p><p>Turning my face to him, I look straight into his blue eyes.</p><p>His black hair is all mussed up from sleeping, but his eyes are wide-awake. He\u2019s been thinking.</p><p>Not good.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you been awake?\u201d I ask, my voice wavering slightly.</p><p>\u201cNot long.\u201d He brushes a stray curl from off my forehead.</p><p>There\u2019s a moment of still between us.</p><p>I don\u2019t know what to say after last night, and it seems neither does Jake.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d he asks, breaking our silent stare.</p><p>Do I need a reason not to be?</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I nod, swallowing.</p><p>Are you?</p><p>Jake closes his eyes, releasing a breath.</p><p>What is he thinking? I\u2019m afraid to ask. Afraid he\u2019s changed his mind about the baby.</p><p>I watch him, waiting. Opening his eyes, he takes my face in his hand and kisses me.</p><p>Deeply. Passionately. Reverently.</p><p>It\u2019s a kiss filled with unspoken words, promises, and love. Deep love. The love that has bound us together for nearly three decades.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re having a baby,\u201d I say when Jake\u2019s kiss slows.</p><p>\u201cWe are.\u201d He tilts his head back, looking into my eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to be a daddy.\u201d I can\u2019t read him right now. He\u2019s still holding back from me.</p><p>He smiles, but it\u2019s tight. I can see the fear in his eyes that he was hiding a moment ago.</p><p>It sparks a pain in my chest. An awful, all-consuming pain.</p><p>\u201cJake, are you...okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, just a little\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOverwhelmed. Scared. Not ready. Changed your mind,\u201d I blurt out, cutting him off.</p><p>He looks puzzled, and then his eyes firm up, his gaze pinning me. \u201cMore like ready. Happy. Wanting our baby more than anything.\u201d His hand touches my stomach, and I exhale the breath I was holding. \u201cI\u2019m just worried,\u201d he adds quietly, casting his gaze beyond me.</p><p>My stomach tenses under his touch. \u201cAbout?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat the baby isn\u2019t okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe baby\u2019s fine.\u201d I relax, putting my hand over his, pressing it to my stomach.</p><p>\u201cI want you to see a doctor today, Tru.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was planning on going on Monday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt has to be today,\u201d he says tightly. \u201cI\u2019ll get Stuart to arrange it.\u201d</p><p>He sits up, turning from me, putting his feet to the floor. I follow, sitting beside him. Turning to face him, I wrap one leg around his front and the other around his back, trapping him.</p><p>\u201cWhy the rush?\u201d I ask, tilting my head to the side, looking into his face.</p><p>Sighing, he meets my eyes for a brief moment, then looks away. \u201cTru, I\u2019ve spent the last eight years using drugs\u2014the last three, on a daily basis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re clean now,\u201d I input.</p><p>\u201cJust over five weeks ago, I wasn\u2019t. Even though I wasn\u2019t using when you got pregnant, those drugs could have still been in my system, and...\u201d He inhales sharply, driving his hand through his hair. He looks down. \u201cI just need to make sure that the baby is okay, that the drugs haven\u2019t had any effect on the baby or caused any long-term damage.\u201d His voice sounds pained.</p><p>Fuck. I hadn\u2019t even thought of that. And if Jake\u2019s worried, I need to be too. He never worries unnecessarily.</p><p>Afraid but trying to remain positive, I say, \u201cI\u2019m sure the baby will be fine.\u201d</p><p>His chest expands on a quick, deep breath. \u201cI\u2019ll believe that when I hear it from a doctor. I need to know today, Tru. Once I know, then I can relax and enjoy this with you.\u201d</p><p>I reach over and take his hand, linking our fingers. \u201cOkay,\u201d I say, running my other hand through his soft, inky hair.</p><p>Reaching to the bedside cabinet for his phone, he says, \u201cI\u2019ll call Stuart now to make us an appointment with the best pregnancy doctor there is.\u201d</p><p>I put my hand on his, stopping him. \u201cThey\u2019re called obstetricians, baby. And don\u2019t you think we should tell my folks, and your mum and Dale first, that we\u2019re having a baby, before we tell Stuart?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSure I do, but we\u2019re not telling them until we know everything is okay.

He might be gay, but he hasn\u2019t magicked up a vagina overnight that I know of.\u201d</p> <p>That gets a smile out of him. A small one, but it\u2019s a start.</p><p>\u201cBecause, smart-ass, there isn\u2019t anything Stuart doesn\u2019t know or can\u2019t find out. That\u2019s why I pay him so well.\u201d</p><p>Lifting my hand from his, I say, \u201cOkay, well, just don\u2019t tell him I\u2019m pregnant. Tell him I\u2019m having women\u2019s problems.\u201d</p><p>Not only do I want to tell my parents first, I don\u2019t want anyone to know about the baby until I know everything is okay.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t worried before Jake said something. But now...now I\u2019m terrified there could be something wrong with the baby.</p> <p>Three hours later, Jake and I are sitting in the office of Dr. Suzanne Kline, doctor to the rich and famous and the best obstetrician money can buy.</p><p>Her receptionist let us into her office. She looked less than happy to be working on a Saturday, but the instant she saw Jake walk in behind me, her face lit up like a Christmas tree.</p><p>She seated us in Dr. Kline\u2019s office, with the offer of a drink, telling us that Dr. Kline would be with us shortly.</p><p>I have to say it\u2019s the nicest doctor\u2019s office I have ever been in.</p><p>It\u2019s light and airy, all cream and beige. I\u2019m sitting in the comfiest leather chair I\u2019ve ever sat in, in front of a huge mahogany desk that looks like it cost more than I earn in a year. There\u2019s a sofa in the corner resembling the one we have at home, and there are pictures of babies everywhere. I\u2019m guessing famous babies.</p><p>My child is going to be famous.</p> <p>Crap. I hadn\u2019t even registered that fact. Sometimes I forget Jake is famous. Even though it\u2019s thrust into my face on a daily basis, I still just think of him as Jake Wethers, my best friend and boy next door.</p><p>Our child is going to be famous simply for the fact Jake is.</p><p>The baby\u2019s not going to have the chance for a normal childhood like I had.</p><p>It\u2019s going to live its life accompanied by bodyguards, safety always a cause for concern.</p><p>I\u2019m going to have to talk to Jake about this. I want our child to have as normal a life as possible. I know he\u2019ll want that too, so we\u2019re going to have to figure out a way to make it happen.</p><p>Jake hasn\u2019t sat still since we arrived. I can feel nerves and tension radiating off him. I have never seen him this worked up before. It\u2019s freaking me out.</p><p>I rest my hand on his thigh, settling his jigging leg.</p><p>He looks at me, giving me a tight smile.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be fine,\u201d I say, trying to sound convincing, even though I am less than confident myself. I become even more so as the minutes pass.</p><p>\u201cI hope so,\u201d he utters. \u201cI really hope so.\u201d He takes my hand, bringing it to his mouth, and brushes a kiss over my knuckles.</p><p>It\u2019s at this point Dr. Kline finally makes her appearance.</p><p>Imagine the one doctor you wouldn\u2019t want in the same room as your hot, ex-womanising, rocker boyfriend. Well, yeah, that\u2019s Dr. Suzanne Kline.</p><p>She is tall, early thirties, I\u2019d say, long blonde hair that is tied back in a sleek ponytail. She\u2019s wearing high-waisted blue jeans that only stick-thin people can wear, with a button-up white shirt tucked in, which sits just perfectly around her perfect-size chest. No gaping buttonholes for her.</p><p>Basically, she\u2019s gorgeous. And I hate her instantly.</p><p>Remind me to kick the crap out of Stuart when we get home.</p><p>She may be the best OB/GYN in LA, but I would have rather settled for the second best, even the third, as long as they didn\u2019t look anything like her.</p><p>\u201cSorry I\u2019m a little late,\u201d she says, advancing across the room toward us.</p><p>Reaching her hand out to me, I spot her perfect manicure and cringe at my chipped red nail varnish.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Dr. Suzanne Kline,\u201d she says. \u201cBut please just call me Suzanne.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrudy Bennett,\u201d I reply. But please just call me Ms. Bennett, I\u2019m tempted to say just to be a bitch.</p><p>I bite my tongue, hard.</p><p>Turning to Jake, she releases her hand from mine and offers it to Jake. He takes it. \u201cJake Wethers,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cI know who you are, Mr. Wethers.\u201d She presses her lips into a quirked smile, looking a little shy, and I see her eyes have widened in his gaze. In this instant she looks like one of his groupies.</p><p>I hate the effect he has on women. She\u2019s a smart, successful doctor, one who comes in contact with celebrities on a regular basis, yet one touch and a look from Jake and she\u2019s a teenage girl again.</p><p>I think I may vomit.</p><p>\u201cJake, please,\u201d he says, and he sounds so smooth that I have the urge to slap him up the back side of his head.</p><p>Releasing her hand, he instantly takes hold of my hand again, pulling it to rest in his lap.</p><p>I feel like giving a smug smile, but I don\u2019t. I know I\u2019m being irrational, I know that Jake only has eyes for me, but I hate the way she was looking at him. I take a quick glance at her left hand as she makes her way around the desk to her chair.</p><p>It\u2019s a yes on the wedding ring. But when has the little matter of having a husband ever stopped women from trying to get into Jake\u2019s pants?</p><p>\u201cPlease excuse my attire,\u201d she says in her sexy American twang, gesturing to her clothes as she sits down. \u201cI came straight from family brunch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry to pull you away,\u201d Jake says. \u201cBut I wanted Tru to see a doctor today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo worries. What seems to be the problem, Tru?\u201d She directs her question to me, leaning forward in her seat.</p><p>I stiffen a little under her blue-eyed scrutiny. \u201cWell, I, um, took a pregnancy test\u2014three actually\u2014and they all said I\u2019m, um, pregnant.\u201d I have no idea why, but my cheeks are bright red, and I feel flustered.</p><p>\u201cThis is good news...for you both?\u201d she asks carefully, moving her eyes between Jake and me.</p><p>\u201cVery good news.\u201d Jake smiles at me, squeezing my hand. \u201cUnplanned but very much wanted.\u201d</p><p>My heart melts.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s wonderful news.\u201d She beams, smiling a bright white Hollywood smile. If possible, she looks even more gorgeous.</p><p>Ugh.</p><p>\u201cMany congratulations to you both,\u201d she adds.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Jake replies.</p><p>I can\u2019t reply because I\u2019m too busy gnawing over the fact that I\u2019m going to get as fat as a house and my baby doctor is a glamazon.</p><p>Dr. Glamazon.</p><p>There really should be a law against this kind of thing. People as beautiful as her should not be allowed to be baby doctors.</p><p>I think I might kick the crap out of Stuart twice now, just for good measure. He\u2019s officially off my Christmas list.</p><p>He\u2019s just introduced Jake to a smart, beautiful glamazon who knows her shit about women\u2019s bits, probably men\u2019s too, so therefore, she will be awesome at sex. And I\u2019m about to turn into fat, dumpy Tru, who very soon won\u2019t have a lot to offer in the sex department.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking it from the urgency to see me today, you have some concern over the pregnancy,\u201d Dr. Glamazon states rather than asks, cutting into my bitching thoughts.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Jake sits forward in his seat but keeps a tight hold of my hand. \u201cIt\u2019s public knowledge of my use of drugs and that I was in rehab getting clean.\u201d I feel him tense, so I rest my free hand on his knee. He gives me a quick glance and continues. \u201cWhat isn\u2019t public knowledge is that a little over seven weeks ago, I started using again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you still using now?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He shakes his head vehemently. \u201cI used for two weeks, stopped, and I\u2019ve been clean for the last five.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat drugs were you taking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCocaine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI take it you\u2019re worried you might still have had drugs in your system when you conceived?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d His grip on my hand tightens to near pain, but I don\u2019t say anything. I\u2019m as anxious as he is to hear what she has to say.</p><p>I\u2019m watching Dr. Glamazon, trying to gauge her reaction to what Jake\u2019s asking, but there\u2019s not a shred of emotion in her face.</p><p>Poker face. I bet she\u2019s had Botox done.</p><p>She leans back in her chair, elbows on the rests, fingers steepled.</p><p>\u201cI understand your concern, Jake, but honestly, there is nothing for you to worry about. There\u2019s been a lot of research done about the possible side effects on sperm from recreational drug usage, and to date there is nothing to prove that drugs cause any long-term side effects on a developing fetus.\u201d</p><p>I feel Jake relax beside me. And me too. It\u2019s such a relief to hear.</p><p>\u201cThe only known side effects are significant reductions in sperm count,\u201d Dr. Glamazon continues, \u201csometimes resulting in infertility\u2014which obviously hasn\u2019t been a problem for you.\u201d She gives him a hinting smile, which raises my hackles.</p><p>I know she\u2019s a doctor, but she seriously shouldn\u2019t talk about my man\u2019s virility like that.</p><p>I clear my throat and raise my eyebrow at her.</p><p>She breezes a look to me, composing herself, and says to Jake, \u201cMost commonly, the issue we see from drug usage and a developing fetus comes directly from the mother. If a woman uses drugs when pregnant, the drugs will pass through the placenta and directly to the baby. That\u2019s when we have issues such as deformities and long-term health problems.\u201d</p><p>Ooh, you bitch.</p><p>I\u2019m seriously getting a new baby doctor.</p><p>\u201cI have never touched drugs in my life,\u201d I state, probably a little too loudly. I dig my nails so hard into Jake\u2019s hand, I hear him wince. \u201cI don\u2019t even smoke cigarettes, let alone joints!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s really good to hear, Tru.\u201d She smiles pleasantly.</p><p>Now I just want to slap her. Hard. A few times.</p><p>God, what the hell is wrong with me? Is this what pregnancy does? Or have I always been this jealous?</p><p>I guess I\u2019m just jealous when it comes to Jake.</p><p>He runs the pad of his thumb across the palm of my hand.</p><p>I know he\u2019s trying to settle me, but I\u2019m a riled right now and in no mood to be settled.</p><p>\u201cI was still on the pill when I got pregnant,\u201d I blurt out.</p><p>Crap, how did I forget that? Actually, how the hell did I manage to get pregnant while on the pill? It\u2019s never failed me in all the years I\u2019ve been taking it.</p><p>\u201cYou were taking the pill when you got pregnant?\u201d Dr. Glamazon asks, her perfectly shaped brow raised.</p><p>Does she think I\u2019m lying or something? Or that I\u2019ve trapped Jake by getting pregnant on purpose?</p><p>Does he think the same?</p><p>I sneak a quick glance at him, but his face is impassive as he looks at Dr. Glamazon.</p><p>I wish I knew what he was thinking right now.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019ve been on the pill for a really long time, and it\u2019s never let me down before\u2014obviously,\u201d I mutter, not helping my case at all.</p><p>I start to chew on my free thumbnail, killing all hope for my nail varnish. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHave you missed taking any pills this month?\u201d Dr. Glamazon asks.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d My face is bright red, like I\u2019m guilty of something. I hate it when that happens. \u201cI never forget. I\u2019ve always been methodical about taking it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you taken any other medication lately?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes she has,\u201d Jake answers. He removes my hand from my mouth, stopping me from biting my nails. \u201cTru was sick while we were on holiday. She had food poisoning, and the doctor prescribed her some medication.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid he advise if there would be any interference with contraception from taking the medication?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jake answers again before I get the chance to. \u201cTru was too sick to be asking or answering any questions at that time, so it was on me, and honestly it wasn\u2019t something I even considered asking the doctor. The fault lies with me on that one.\u201d</p><p>I feel him talking to me in that last sentence.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no fault,\u201d I whisper to him. \u201cI\u2019m happy to be having our baby.\u201d</p><p>He smiles. One of those special, reserved-for-me-only smiles.</p> <p>Dr. Glamazon starts talking, interrupting our moment. \u201cThe medication you took, combined with the sickness, possibly will have made the contraceptive pill ineffective. The prescribing doctor should have advised of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill my being on the pill while pregnant have harmed the baby at all?\u201d I turn to her, shifting forward in my seat, changing the direction of this conversation.</p><p>Between the two of us, Jake and I don\u2019t seem to have been aiming to give our baby the best start in life.</p><p>She smiles, and this one actually appears genuine. \u201cIt\u2019s a common thing that happens among women, so no, I don\u2019t think there will be any side effects from it. Just to give you both total peace of mind, I\u2019ll do a scan now and take a look at your baby to make sure all is okay.\u201d</p><p>A scan? Now? I\u2019m going to see my baby right now? My heart practically pole vaults out of my chest.</p><p>I don\u2019t miss the way Jake\u2019s hand tightens around mine either.</p> <p>I risk a look at him, but his face is impassive. A mask. The one he wears when he doesn\u2019t want people\u2014mainly me\u2014to know what he\u2019s thinking.</p><p>Standing and moving around her desk, past us, Dr. Glamazon asks, \u201cWhen was the last day of your last period, Tru?\u201d</p><p>I cast my mind back. Turning in my seat, I say, \u201cThe third of October, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, can you undress your lower half and hop up on the bed?\u201d She points to the sterile-looking bed at the far side of the room she\u2019s walking toward. \u201cYou can cover yourself up with this.\u201d She places a drape on the bed.</p><p>With nerves fluttering in my tummy, I go over to the bed, leaving Jake in his seat. Dr. Glamazon pulls the curtain, giving me privacy.</p><p>It\u2019s not until I\u2019m actually on the bed that I wonder why the hell I need my pants off if she\u2019s going to scan my tummy? Unless she\u2019s going to do an internal examination first.</p><p>Oh God, she\u2019s going to do an internal in front of Jake. I know he\u2019s seen everything I have to offer, but I really don\u2019t want him here while the doctor pokes around my lady bits. I wonder if I could ask him to leave without offending him.</p><p>\u201cAll ready?\u201d Dr. Glamazon asks from behind the curtain.</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d I reply, my voice sounding a little strangled.</p><p>Pulling back the curtain a little she walks in, followed by Jake.</p><p>He looks uncomfortable. Then I see his eyes instantly go to my lower half, which is covered by the drape, and a sexy smile flirts across his lips.</p><p>Only Jake would see the sexy side of this current situation. He\u2019s such a perv. But I like that no matter what circumstance I\u2019m in, I can still get him that way.</p><p>I reach for his hand, smiling up at him. I mouth, Perv.</p><p>His eyes twinkle, and he grins, lips pressed together. He flickers a glance to Dr. Glamazon, who has her back to us, getting something from a cupboard. He mouths to me, You look so fucking sexy right now. He traces his finger along my jaw.</p><p>I roll my eyes at him and mouth back, Yeah, sure I do.</p><p>Another glance to the doctor and he mouths back, expression firm and serious, Yes, you do. You always do.</p><p>Okay. That\u2019s me told.</p><p>I smile softly at him, and then Dr. Glamazon appears beside me.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Trudy,\u201d she begins, while fiddling with a monitor she\u2019s pulled over beside me. \u201cBecause you\u2019re so early into your pregnancy, I\u2019m going to do a transvaginal ultrasound.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA transvaginal ultrasound. I\u2019ll place this inside you.\u201d She lifts up what can only be described as something that looks exactly like a handheld blender. \u201cIt will show us your baby. It\u2019s the same as a sonogram, only done internally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to put that inside of me?\u201d My lungs seize up for a few held breaths.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s perfectly safe and pain-free.\u201d</p><p>I look at Jake, worried. He smiles and smooths my hair back from my forehead, but I can see in his eyes that even he\u2019s a bit freaked.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be fine,\u201d he says. \u201cHaving this done means we\u2019re going to get to see our baby.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, well, that\u2019s easy for him to say. He\u2019s not getting a huge handheld blender stuck up his vagina. Of course I want to see our baby and know it\u2019s okay, but holy fuck, that thing looks painful.</p><p>\u201cI would normally do a sonogram for the first scan,\u201d Dr. Glamazon explains, \u201cbut they\u2019re done at twelve weeks. As you\u2019re so early into your pregnancy, the baby won\u2019t show on a sonogram. This is the only way I\u2019m going to be able to see the baby to check that all is okay.\u201d</p><p>Guess I don\u2019t have a choice, then.</p><p>She retrieves a pair of surgical gloves from a box and puts them on.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Tru. In a few moments you\u2019re going to see your baby on this screen here.\u201d She nods in the direction of the monitor beside me.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I swallow.</p><p>I\u2019m going to see my baby in a few moments. Wow. This is getting real now.</p><p>\u201cIf you could just bend your knees up for me. Perfect. Now just relax,\u201d Dr. Glamazon says, resting her hand against my knee as she starts to insert that god-awful thing inside of me.</p><p>Wincing, I scrunch up my face, squeezing Jake\u2019s hand.</p><p>Oh, okay, actually it\u2019s not as bad as I thought it would be.</p><p>\u201cThere we go,\u201d she says. \u201cThis tiny little thing here is your baby.\u201d</p><p>I flick my eyes open and come face-to-face with a little blob on the screen.</p><p>My baby. Our baby.</p><p>My heart lifts into my mouth, and tears prick my eyes.</p><p>I notice Jake\u2019s grip on my hand has tightened along with my own, and when I turn to look at him, I see his eyes fixed on the screen. Glittering and filled with awe. My heart trembles, lifts, and then flutters daintily out of my chest.</p><p>\u201cJake?\u201d I whisper.</p><p>His eyes move to mine, and in their meeting, a heartbreaking smile sweeps over his face. A smile I will remember for the rest of my days.</p><p>Leaning down to me, he presses a kiss to my forehead.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he whispers against my skin, and I almost crack wide open on the spot.</p><p>A tear slides from my eye, and I discreetly brush it away.</p><p>\u201cEverything looks absolutely fine to me,\u201d Dr. Glamazon says, looking at the screen, moving a mouse around, clicking little markers around my tiny baby. \u201cWe have a good, strong heartbeat. Baby is growing nicely. I\u2019d say you\u2019re coming up to about six weeks along.\u201d</p><p>Staring at my tiny baby, I feel all kinds of emotions I\u2019ve never felt before. I can\u2019t even begin to form words to express them.</p><p>Then Dr. Glamazon is removing the wand from me, and my tiny baby disappears from view.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll run off some prints for you.\u201d She smiles at both Jake and me, and I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s because of the mirrored expressions of disappointment on our faces.</p><p>Leaving me to dress, Jake sits back in his seat while the doctor sorts out our baby pictures.</p><p>I dress, feeling happy and excited. We\u2019re having a baby. A real honest-to-God baby.</p><p>Seeing the pregnancy tests made it real, of course. But in a surreal way. Seeing our baby up on that screen made it real in the best possible way.</p><p>I slide my shoes back on and return to my seat beside Jake.</p><p>He takes hold of my hand the moment I sit down, linking his fingers with mine. He kisses my hand.</p><p>The love and emotion moving between us right now is palpable. I can\u2019t wait to be alone with him and talk to him about the future we\u2019re going to have with our baby.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll write you up a prescription for some prenatal vitamins,\u201d Dr. Glamazon says, scribbling on a prescription pad. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll have my receptionist make an appointment for your next checkup so we can order some bloodwork.\u201d</p><p>She tears off the prescription and hands it to me. \u201cDon\u2019t forget the pictures of your baby,\u201d she adds, handing me a white envelope.</p><p>My baby. I\u2019m going to be a mum.</p><p>Taking that as our cue to leave, I rise from my seat. \u201cThank you, Doctor. And thanks for seeing us on your day off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was happy to. If you have any other questions, please don\u2019t hesitate to call me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a question,\u201d Jake adds, still perched on his seat, long legs stretched out.</p><p>I pause and look down at him.</p><p>\u201cSex,\u201d he says to the doctor.</p><p>\u201cSex?\u201d Dr. Glamazon repeats.</p><p>Sex?</p><p>\u201cYes, sex. Can Tru and I still have sex while she\u2019s pregnant? Is it safe for the baby?\u201d</p><p>She smiles. I do too. I actually have to stop from giggling. He is so bloody cute to me right now.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely safe,\u201d Dr. Glamazon says, nodding. \u201cYou can continue to have a healthy and active sex life throughout the whole pregnancy.\u201d</p><p>Jake scratches his forehead. \u201cYeah, I know people generally have sex while pregnant, but it\u2019s just that I, um...well, I have...\u201d He thrusts his hand through is hair, and I can\u2019t help but smile at his struggling, wondering where on earth he\u2019s going with this.</p><p>\u201cLook, I have a huge penis,\u201d he states, looking Dr. Glamazon dead in the eye.</p><p>I burst out laughing, quickly clamping my hand over my mouth.</p><p>Dr. Glamazon looks shocked. Can\u2019t blame her. Jake Wethers just said \u201cpenis\u201d in her office. Specifically, \u201cI have a huge penis.\u201d</p><p>My smutty, tattooed, sexy rock star Jake just said \u201cpenis.\u201d It just sounds so very, very wrong.</p><p>I start laughing again.</p><p>Jake turns his head, giving me a pissed-off look. Okay, so he\u2019s not amused.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I say, moving my hand from my mouth. \u201cI\u2019ve just never heard you say that word before.\u201d I snort. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll shut up,\u201d I add at his hardening expression. I press my lips together, twisting the grin off them. It\u2019s harder than you\u2019d think.</p><p>\u201cLook, what I\u2019m trying to say is...\u201d Jake thrusts his hand through his hair again. \u201cIs that I\u2019m bigger than the average man. A lot bigger. And I just want to know I won\u2019t hurt the baby when Tru and I have sex.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I look at Dr. Glamazon and can see her eyes are flicking to everything but Jake.

There is no way you can hurt it, no matter how big you...um, are.\u201d She looks so uncomfortable right now that I actually feel for her.</p><p>But I still want to laugh.

I scrunch my features up.</p><p>\u201cYou are so fuckin\u2019 laughing.\u201d He scowls.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d A laugh slips out. I try to cover it with a cough. \u201cI just can\u2019t believe you of all people just said the word \u2018penis.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you want me to call it?\u201d he bites out.</p><p>\u201cI would have preferred it if you hadn\u2019t said it at all to Dr. Hot back there.\u201d</p><p>He slides me a \u201clet\u2019s not go there\u201d look. Taking a left turn, Jake takes us into the hills toward home.</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d he sighs. \u201cI just wanted to make sure I couldn\u2019t hurt our baby when we have sex, which you know with you, I want to do often\u2014multiple times daily, in fact.\u201d He runs his hand up my thigh and my sex quivers, suddenly desperate for his touch, needing to feel him inside me.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019m going to say to the doctor, \u2018I have a huge cock,\u2019\u201d he adds, and that\u2019s like a bucket of cold water over my libido, setting my laughter off again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m never going to live this down, am I?\u201d he grumbles, taking hold of the gear stick.</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d I slide him a humoured look.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to tell everyone we know, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot everyone. Maybe just Stuart. And Simone. And my dad.\u201d</p><p>My dad would find it hilarious for sure. He has the same warped sense of humour as me.</p><p>\u201cIf you tell Billy that I said penis to the doctor, then I\u2019m going to tell him exactly what you do to my penis with that hot, dirty mouth of yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t dare,\u201d I gasp.</p><p>\u201cTry me.\u201d He narrows his eyes, challenging.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a child,\u201d I huff.</p><p>\u201cSays you, who\u2019s been laughing about the word \u2018penis\u2019 for the last ten minutes.\u201d</p><p>Penis.</p><p>I look at him. I\u2019m grinning. Then Jake\u2019s smile cracks, and we both start laughing hard, and it feels good. For a moment, it feels like we\u2019re those carefree teenagers we used to be.</p><p>We\u2019re still laughing when Jake pulls up at our gates and Henry lets us in.</p><p>Parking the car on the drive, we go inside, and I kick my shoes off and flop down on the sofa.</p><p>I pull the envelope containing the baby pictures out of my bag. I\u2019ve been dying to look at them, but I wanted to wait until we were home so we could look at them in private together.</p><p>Another happy memory to coat the walls of our home.</p><p>Jake sits beside me, taking my feet in his lap. \u201cCan I?\u201d he gestures to the envelope.</p><p>I hand it to him and watch as he takes the pictures out.</p><p>I move closer to him, sitting beside him, my thigh pressed against his. Jake\u2019s arm goes around me and I rest my shoulder against his chest as we both stare down at the black-and-white picture of our baby. Our tiny, tiny baby.</p><p>Jake is so still. All I can hear is the sound of his gentle breathing. I steal a glance at his face, and the emotion I see steals my own.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really ours,\u201d he says, fingertip touching the image of our baby. His voice is so soft.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really ours,\u201d I utter, my voice cracking.</p><p>\u201cWho knew I could contribute to making something so perfect?\u201d Jake glances at me through his long lashes. \u201cThank you.\u201d This is the second time today he\u2019s thanked me, and this time I have to ask why.</p><p>\u201cFor being with me. For giving me a chance at getting my life right. Only with you would I ever have a chance at having a family. You\u2019re everything to me, and now you\u2019ve given me so much more with our baby.\u201d</p><p>Tilting his face to mine, I kiss his lips tenderly.</p><p>He wraps his arms around me, taking me with him back into the sofa, his lips pressed to my forehead.</p><p>I love feeling Jake this way. Contented and at peace with himself.</p><p>I trace my finger over the detailed tattoos on his arm. \u201cLife\u2019s good, huh?\u201d I murmur.</p><p>\u201cLife\u2019s great.\u201d I feel his smile against my skin.</p><p>\u201cYou hungry?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cI could eat something. You want to order in?\u201d</p><p>I shift back from him so I can see his face. \u201cWe could cook something once in a while, you know,\u201d I tease.</p><p>\u201cYou in the mood to cook?\u201d</p><p>Too comfortable to consider moving right now, I shake my head.</p><p>\u201cOrdering in it is, then.\u201d He chuckles deep. It vibrates through his chest. \u201cWhat are you in the mood for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChicken Caesar salad with Parmesan and a crusty roll.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing specific, then,\u201d he teases.</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m eating for two here, you know.\u201d</p><p>Smiling, Jake gets his phone out and orders my salad and a grilled cheese for himself from the local deli.</p><p>While he\u2019s on the phone, my thoughts drift to the scan and how it felt seeing our baby. Then my thoughts move to Dr. Kline and how attractive she is. I wonder if Jake thinks she\u2019s good-looking. Before I can think it through, in usual Tru style, I\u2019m saying, \u201cDr. Kline is really pretty.\u201d</p><p>He shoves his phone back in his pocket. \u201cI hadn\u2019t noticed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure you hadn\u2019t.\u201d I roll my eyes.</p><p>Jake lifts my leg off him. He leans over me, forcing me to lie back, and places his hands either side of me, pelvis pressed hard against my sex. He rests the tip of his nose against mine. \u201cI hadn\u2019t noticed,\u201d he repeats. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in the room, sweetheart, I don\u2019t see anyone but you.\u201d</p><p>A shiver runs down my spine, and I start to hum with desire.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to get fat,\u201d I say, pouting.</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re going to have my baby growing inside of you, and right now I can\u2019t think of anything sexier.\u201d</p><p>Jake slants his mouth over mine, kissing me leisurely. I part my lips with a moan, and his tongue moves inside, stroking mine.</p><p>Right now, I would like nothing more than to have Jake inside me, but our lunch is on its way, and I have this nagging worry about calling my parents to tell them about the baby. Mainly my mum. I\u2019m worried how she\u2019s going to take the news. I\u2019m already well aware of her concerns over my relationship with Jake and my moving here after such a short time together. Plus the engagement, coupled with the problems Jake\u2019s had\u2014we\u2019ve had. I fear this may push her over the edge.</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of the baby,\u201d I say, as his tongue trails over my lower lip.</p><p>\u201cWere we? I thought we were heading more in the direction of doing what created our baby in the first place.\u201d He puts his hand up my top, pulling back the cup on my bra, and gently rolls my nipple between his thumb and forefinger.</p><p>My body instinctively arches into his touch.</p><p>\u201cI need to call my folks and tell them about the baby,\u201d I utter, breathless.</p><p>\u201cSoon,\u201d he groans, pushing his erection against my sex. The seam of his jeans works through my own, rubbing against my throbbing clit.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t call my parents straight after we\u2019ve made love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo call them tonight. That\u2019s if I\u2019m done with you by then,\u201d he breathes, nipping my earlobe with his teeth. \u201cI\u2019m desperate for you,\u201d he groans.</p><p>Aching from his promise, but worry claiming me more, I put my hands to his chest. \u201cI want you too, Jake, but right now, I need to call them.\u201d</p><p>Stopping his assault on my earlobe, he moves back and looks me in the eye. \u201cYou\u2019re worried they won\u2019t be happy about the baby, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>I bite my lip and shake my head.</p><p>He sits back on his heels, staring down at me, and I see a darkness take his eyes. \u201cSorry, I\u2019ll rephrase that. You\u2019re worried Eva won\u2019t be happy about you having a baby with me.\u201d</p><p>I sigh and push my hands through my hair.</p><p>\u201cYou know Mama thinks we\u2019ve moved too fast together. She worries for me\u2014a lot\u2014and she lived this life with my dad, having a baby with a musician, on the road, and...\u201d I trail off, struggling to find the right words. \u201cI guess I\u2019m just worried she\u2019ll...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Want you to go back to England to live? Make you choose?\u201d He frowns.</p><p>\u201cNo. I don\u2019t know.\u201d I shrug. Sitting up, I wrap my arms around his waist, resting my cheek against his chest. \u201cI just don\u2019t want her to be angry with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTru.\u201d He rests his hands on my shoulders and moves down to my eye level. I can see that his hardened expression has softened. \u201cYou just said yourself that she\u2019s lived this life.\u201d He tucks my hair behind my ear. \u201cBut remember, we are more financially secure than they were back then. I\u2019m not just some singer in a band.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut when she gets something in her head, Jake, it\u2019s hard trying to change it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReminds me of someone I know well,\u201d he implies with a smile. \u201cWe\u2019ll call them now and settle your mind, and I\u2019ll screw you mindless later.\u201d</p><p>Getting his phone back out, he dials my parents\u2019 home number, putting it on speaker, and sets the phone on the coffee table before us.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d comes my dad\u2019s deep voice down the line. Just hearing his voice causes my heart to beat faster.</p><p>\u201cHey, Daddy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby girl!\u201d I can almost see his big, bright smile. I miss him so much. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good, Daddy. Um, is Mama there?\u201d I swallow.</p><p>\u201cYeah, you want me to get her? Your old man not good enough to talk to nowadays?\u201d he teases.</p><p>\u201cActually, I need to talk to you both. Can you put me on speaker?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything okay, darlin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s fine, Daddy. I\u2014we\u2014have some news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, let me get your mum.\u201d</p><p>I slide a look at Jake, desperately trying to swallow down my nerves.</p><p>Jake rubs my back. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s going to be fine,\u201d he whispers. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTru, is everything okay?\u201d My mum\u2019s worried tone comes on.</p><p>\u201cYes, everything\u2019s fine. Great, in fact.\u201d I run my tongue over my dry lips. \u201cIs Dad still there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Jake\u2019s here too, and, um, we\u2019ve got some news. We\u2019re, um...we\u2019re having a baby.\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s utter silence. For a really long time.</p><p>Then my dad breaks it.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great news, honey. Really, really great news. Isn\u2019t it, Eva?\u201d I can practically feel him elbowing my mum to respond.</p><p>\u201cC\u00f3mo pudiste permitir que esto suceda?\u201d</p><p>My face heats and prickles.</p> <p>\u201cQue esto suceda? Let this happen, Mama?\u201d I repeat in English, as I don\u2019t want to hide anything about this conversation from Jake. \u201cI didn\u2019t let anything happen. We didn\u2019t intend to get pregnant, obviously. But it\u2019s something that has happened, and we are both extremely happy about it. I was hoping you would be too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are happy,\u201d my dad insists.</p><p>\u201cMama?\u201d I press.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to give the band up, Jake?\u201d she asks him directly.</p><p>\u201cNo, he\u2019s not,\u201d I say before he gets a chance to speak.</p><p>She sighs loudly. \u201cSo he will be on the road touring, and you will be home alone in America with a baby.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jake butts in before I get another chance to speak.</p><p>Probably a good thing because I\u2019m so bloody rattled right now.</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t worked out the fine details yet, Eva, but Tru won\u2019t be home alone with the baby. I\u2019m going to be the biggest part of our baby\u2019s life. I won\u2019t have my child raised the way I was.\u201d The harshness of his tone surprises me, but I can\u2019t blame him. \u201cI see your concern, really I do, but it won\u2019t be that way. I will always be here for them both. I don\u2019t want you and Billy to worry.\u201d</p><p>My mum is silent for a tense moment.</p><p>\u201cI want you to be happy about this, Mama. This isn\u2019t like you and Dad on the road. Jake\u2019s life is different\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s bigger than your father\u2019s ever was. Jake is busy and in demand, and his life is pressured. Look at what happened the last time things got hard for him. He was back on drugs and you found that girl in his bed. You were brokenhearted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMama!\u201d I cry, devastated she\u2019s bringing that back up.</p><p>\u201cEnough, now, Eva,\u201d my dad says. \u201cYou know what happened.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s another tense moment of silence, as tears make their way down my cheeks.</p><p>\u201cI know I\u2019ve screwed up in the past and let Tru down,\u201d Jake says, breaking the silence. \u201cTrust me, no one knows that better than I do.\u201d His voice is hoarse and it hurts me to hear. \u201cBut it won\u2019t ever happen again. I know what I stand to lose, believe me. I love Tru very much. She\u2019s everything to me, and I want her happiness as much as you do.\u201d</p><p>I reach out and caress his cheek.</p><p>I turn back to the phone. \u201cI thought you of all people would understand this, Mama.\u201d I rub the tears from my face. \u201cThat you would be on my side and support us in having this baby.\u201d</p><p>I hear her sharp intake of breath. \u201cI am on your side, Tru. I\u2019m always on your side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo then be happy for me...for us. You\u2019re going to be a grandma, and Dad a granddaddy.\u201d</p><p>The moment of silence is soft, not sullen. That\u2019s when I know I have her.</p><p>\u201cHow far along are you?\u201d she asks, her voice wavering a little.</p><p>\u201cSix weeks.\u201d A smile bites my lips. \u201cI have some pictures. I can scan one into the laptop and e-mail it to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I say, wrapping the call up. \u201cI\u2019ll scan it in soon and e-mail it over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTru.\u201d She pauses. \u201cI\u2019m happy for you...for you both.\u201d</p><p>Tears prick my eyes. \u201cThanks, Mama. I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove you,\u201d Mama says.</p><p>\u201cAnd me!\u201d Dad calls in.</p><p>I chuckle past the lump in my throat. \u201cLove you too, Daddy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, and make sure Jake doesn\u2019t smoke near you now that you\u2019re pregnant,\u201d Mama starts in, \u201cand you\u2019ll need to start taking prenatal vitamins. No caffeine or seafood...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got it covered, Mama.\u201d I smile. \u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, we\u2019ll see you soon.\u201d</p><p>We all say our good-byes, and Jake ends the call. I fall back against the sofa.</p><p>\u201cBloody hell, that was stressful,\u201d I mutter, driving my fingers over my aching scalp.</p><p>Jake lies back beside me. \u201cYou can\u2019t blame her. She worries because she loves you, and I can see where she\u2019s coming from. In her eyes, I\u2019m not exactly ideal husband or father material.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, she\u2019s wrong.\u201d I turn my face to his and trace my finger over his full lips.</p><p>\u201cThat may be, but I have to prove it to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to prove anything to anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. To both your mom and dad. I want them to trust that I can take care of you both.\u201d He runs his fingers over my tummy.</p><p>\u201cMy dad trusts you. He thinks the world of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe likes me, Tru. We get on great. But I don\u2019t know about trust, especially not with his little girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I trust you, and that\u2019s what counts.\u201d I take hold of his hand, bringing it from my stomach to my mouth, and kiss it. \u201cDo you want to call your mum and Dale?\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head, chuckling. \u201cNo, I think we need a break after that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think she\u2019ll be difficult like Mama was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but right now all I can think about is getting you naked and finishing what we started before. I seriously need to get inside you after listening to you get all fiery, talking in angry Spanish like that.\u201d</p><p>Laughing, I say, \u201cThe food will be here soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got time,\u201d he says, taking hold of my legs, pulling me down the couch. He kneels between them and sets to work on removing my jeans and panties, while I remove my top and bra.</p><p>Jake takes his T-shirt off, and then we\u2019re skin on skin, as he rests his chest against mine.</p><p>I wind my fingers into his hair, bringing his mouth to mine. I hook my leg around his hip as his hand slides down my thigh, gripping my butt, and he kisses me like he\u2019s starved for me, his tongue plunging into my mouth, deep and hard. His hands take mine, above my head, pinning them to the cushion.</p><p>I grind my pelvis into him, groaning in his mouth.</p><p>Then the doorbell rings.</p><p>\u201cMotherfucker,\u201d he growls heavily into my mouth. \u201cCan\u2019t a guy get a moment with his girl here?\u201d He grumbles, getting up to answer the door.</p><p>I start to sit up to retrieve my clothes. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare move,\u201d he commands. \u201cI want to come back here and find you exactly as I left you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how\u2019s that?\u201d I ask, resting my arms on the back of the sofa and my chin on my arms, looking across at him. God, he looks so totally hot right now. Abs rippling down to his low-slung jeans. My tattoo inked around them. His hard-on so very visible through his jeans, like his cock is straining to get out of them and into me.</p><p>\u201cNaked and waiting to be fucked.\u201d He grins, walking backward.</p><p>\u201cS\u00ed, se\u00f1or.\u201d I salute.</p><p>He groans, grabbing his cock through his jeans, then turns and heads for the door.</p><p>I lie back down on the sofa so whoever\u2019s at the door won\u2019t see naked me sitting here.</p><p>I hear the door open, then Henry\u2019s voice. The door closes, so I sit up just as Jake walks back into the living room with a bag containing our lunch in his hand.</p><p>\u201cYou want to eat now?\u201d he asks, totally insincerely.</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cI want you to get your hot ass over here and use that huge penis of yours on me.\u201d I bite down on my grin.</p><p>Jake puts the bag of food down on the side table and advances toward me like a panther moving in on its prey.</p><p>\u201cWith absolute fuckin\u2019 pleasure,\u201d he says, vaulting over the back of the couch, landing on his feet between my legs, he gets down to his knees, and down to business instantly.</p><p>CHAPTER FIFTEEN</p><p>I look around at the Christmas decorations adorning the restaurant and I get that giddy, excitable feeling I always get this time of year. Now it\u2019s a million times amplified, because this Christmas will be Jake\u2019s and my first Christmas together in years, and our first as a couple. A couple who\u2019s having a baby.</p><p>We\u2019re having a baby! I\u2019m still excited about it, if you didn\u2019t guess.</p><p>It\u2019s also Jake\u2019s birthday on the twenty-third of December. He\u2019ll be the grand old age of twenty-seven. Like our Christmas, this is the first birthday together in twelve years, so I\u2019m making sure it\u2019ll be a good one.</p><p>That\u2019s why I\u2019m out for dinner tonight with Stuart and Carly: we\u2019re planning a surprise birthday party for Jake.</p><p>I considered spending his birthday with just the two of us, but we have so many people coming for Christmas, that it just seemed right to share his day with everyone we love.</p><p>Carly has become a really good friend since I hired her company to decorate our house. She is doing an amazing job. We\u2019re halfway through the decorating, but Carly assures me it will be finished in time for Christmas, thank God. I can\u2019t think of anything worse than a house full of people in a half-decorated house.</p><p>My mum and dad are coming for Christmas. I\u2019m so excited to see them; it\u2019s been way too long.</p><p>Simone is coming for Christmas too. She\u2019ll be staying at Denny\u2019s place, but they\u2019re coming over to ours for Christmas dinner.</p><p>We\u2019ve also got Tom coming, and Zane too. Apparently Zane isn\u2019t close to his family in New York, so I told Jake to invite him. I can\u2019t bear to think of anyone alone at Christmas, let alone people I care about.</p><p>I invited Smith and Carly too, but they\u2019re heading back home to Tennessee after Jake\u2019s party.</p><p>Of course Jake\u2019s mum, Susie, and his stepdad, Dale, are coming.</p><p>Jake knows none of this. He knows everyone is coming for Christmas, but he thinks everyone is getting in on Christmas Eve.</p><p>It\u2019ll be nice to see Susie again. I haven\u2019t seen her since Paul\u2019s funeral in Manchester. And I haven\u2019t seen Dale since I was fourteen.</p><p>She was over the moon when we called and told her I\u2019m pregnant. Hers was the complete opposite reaction from my mum\u2019s.</p><p>I think she\u2019s relieved and happy that Jake is finally settling down. That he\u2019s found his happiness.</p><p>Everyone else was stoked about the baby too. Stuart flipped, in the best possible way. Simone went all crazy too. But the most touching reaction was Vicky\u2019s. When I told her I was pregnant, she started crying real, happy tears. I was Skyping with her, and I could see the genuine emotion. It set me off crying too.</p><p>I owe Vicky a lot. If it wasn\u2019t for her landing the interview with Jake, we wouldn\u2019t be together now. I have everything in the world to thank her for.</p><p>I was hoping Vicky would come for Christmas too, but she already has plans with her family. But I\u2019m making sure I\u2019ll see her real soon. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo we\u2019re really having this birthday party at Pizza Hut?\u201d Stuart grimaces.</p><p>\u201cStop being a snob,\u201d I say, laughing. \u201cPizza Hut is important to Jake and me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh yes, the teenage-dream years.\u201d He places his hand over his heart, teasingly.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d Carly asks.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a tradition when Jake and I were younger. We used to celebrate our birthdays at Pizza Hut. When we got back in contact, the first thing Jake did was take me out to dinner at Pizza Hut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe hired the whole place out for her,\u201d Stuart adds. \u201cIt was really sweet. I was genuinely impressed with him.\u201d He smiles at me, giving me a secret wink.</p><p>\u201cHave you picked out his gift?\u201d Stuart asks, cutting into his steak.</p><p>\u201cI have.\u201d I smile proudly, biting down on a stick of asparagus.</p><p>I was stuck what to buy Jake. I mean, what do you buy the man who has everything?</p> <p>Then I remembered Jake\u2019s old guitar, the first guitar he ever had that my dad bought him.</p><p>When he left for the States, he left his guitar behind, and my dad has kept it all these years. It was packed away in the garage, so I asked my dad to get it out and have it reconditioned.</p><p>He\u2019s shipping it out to me this week, and when it arrives, I\u2019m going to have some artwork done on the back for him.</p><p>I definitely think it\u2019s thirteen birthdays\u2019 worth in the thought alone.</p><p>\u201cSo we\u2019ve got the guest list settled, then?\u201d I say, peering down at my notepad on the table, reaching for my water.</p><p>\u201cActually, you need to add a plus one...for me,\u201d Stuart says, looking sheepish.</p> <p>I put my glass back down without taking a drink. \u201cA plus one.\u201d I smile. \u201cMight this be the mysterious man you\u2019ve been keeping from us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and he isn\u2019t mysterious. You know his name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJosh the hot doctor!\u201d both Carly and I chime together. \u201cAnd yes, he is,\u201d I add. \u201cYou haven\u2019t let any of us catch a glimpse of him, let alone meet him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I didn\u2019t want you lot scaring him away. He\u2019s shy.\u201d He bites the steak off his fork.</p><p>\u201cBut he\u2019s coming to the party?\u201d</p><p>Stuart smiles, chewing. \u201cHe is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYay!\u201d I clap my hands together.</p><p>This guy is important to Stuart, I can tell by the way he is about him. I cannot wait to meet the guy who is putting that gorgeous smile on Stuart\u2019s face.</p> <p>I scribble down hot doctor Josh\u2019s name on my list and underline it.</p><p>\u201cAre your mom and dad coming for the party?\u201d Carly asks.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I press my lips together.</p><p>\u201cYour mom is okay with Jake and the baby now?\u201d</p><p>Carly has been the listening ear to my venting. Even though Mama has accepted the fact that Jake and I are having a baby, and she\u2019s looking forward to being a grandma, she is still somewhat frosty when it comes to Jake. And I know for a fact she thinks I should move back to England to have the baby.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s almost there,\u201d I say with a nod, picking up my water again. \u201cI think the visit at Christmas will do it. Jake will win Mama over. I\u2019m sure of it.\u201d</p><p>Okay, maybe not sure\u2014hoping.</p><p>Mama can\u2019t see past Jake\u2019s history. But I\u2019m not perfect either. She doesn\u2019t see how I hurt Jake when I was stuck between him and Will, and how he fought for me. How much he loves me.</p><p>No matter how many times I tell her that Jake and I have hurt each other enough to last a lifetime and he\u2019s not going to hurt me like that again, she thinks what she thinks.</p><p>It can take a while for Mama to change her beliefs.</p><p>I know deep down she knows Jake loves me, but she\u2019s worried Jake will screw up, and I\u2019ll be left alone, broken and hurt.</p><p>I\u2019m not worried for a moment. I know Jake. I know what us being together, having this baby together, means to him.</p><p>I hope that Christmas will make her see this; then all will be good, and she\u2019ll relax on Jake.</p><p>\u201cI gotta give your mom kudos, though, gorgeous,\u201d Stuart says. \u201cShe is the only woman I have ever known who Jake can\u2019t get eating out of the palm of his hand in five seconds flat. Not only that, I think he is actually scared of her. I think I may be in love with a woman for the first time in my life,\u201d he muses, knocking my elbow with his, chuckling.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Mama,\u201d I sigh, putting my glass down. \u201cA force to be reckoned with.\u201d</p><p>I just hope she fully comes around soon. She will. I think.</p><p>After dinner, Dave drops Carly at home, then brings Stuart and me back. Dave is now my personal bodyguard. Jake has gone all superprotective, more than normal, now that I\u2019m pregnant, and I\u2019m to have Dave with me at all times.</p><p>Honestly, I can barely pee without him there. Seriously, it\u2019s a good job I like Dave, because I\u2019m with him more than I am Jake nowadays.</p><p>Jake ramped up my security when the news of my pregnancy broke. I\u2019ve been receiving hate mail from some of Jake\u2019s more \u201coverenthusiastic\u201d fans.</p><p>They think I\u2019m trying to take him away from his rock lifestyle by having his baby. Turn him into a family man and away from his music.</p><p>Yes, some people are that crazy.</p><p>The overall reaction from the public has been really positive, though. I think the normal, sane people are glad to see Jake happy. I couldn\u2019t be happier to be the one who brought him to this place in his life.</p><p>So now Jake has Ben with him, and I have Dave permanently attached to my side.</p><p>Dave pulls up on the drive, and I climb out of the car, saying good night to him.</p><p>Stuart sees me to the front door, leaving me with a kiss on the cheek, and heads around to the back to his place. I don\u2019t hear Dave pull away until I\u2019m safely inside the house. He is nothing but thorough when it comes to his job. And currently, for the foreseeable future, I\u2019m Dave\u2019s job.</p><p>The house is in darkness.</p><p>Not bothering to turn on the lights, I head straight for our bedroom, figuring Jake will already be in bed.</p><p>When I enter, I find it empty.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t outside having a smoke, as I would have seen him when I passed through the living room. I wonder if he\u2019s in his studio.</p><p>I put my purse on the dressing table, kick off my heels, and set about finding Jake.</p><p>As I walk down the hall, I hear the piano playing in the library.</p><p>The door is ajar.</p><p>I push it open and find the room in darkness, lit only by the bright moon coming in through the windows.</p><p>Jake\u2019s seated at my piano, playing a song I don\u2019t recognise, wearing only a pair of black pyjama bottoms.</p><p>He cuts a solitary figure.</p><p>I listen to the song he\u2019s singing so very softly, but I can\u2019t make out the actual words. He sounds beautiful.</p><p>\u201cHe plays piano in the dark,\u201d I say, leaning against the door frame.</p><p>He instantly stops playing and glances over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d He smiles. But even from here, I can see something is off in his smile.</p><p>He turns from me, back to the piano, and starts to play the chorus from Brenda Russell\u2019s classic \u201cPiano in the Dark.\u201d</p><p>This is my mum\u2019s favourite song.</p><p>I have so many memories of it from my childhood. I remember listening to Mama sing along to it on her stereo while she was in the kitchen fixing dinner. I wonder if Jake remembers.</p><p>I love how music can elicit memories.</p><p>And I love how even now it still binds Jake and me together. It\u2019s our connection. It\u2019s how we talk.</p><p>Jake continues to play as I walk across the hardwood floor to him.</p><p>I trail my fingers over the back of his neck, running them into his hair, and kiss his temple before leaning over the piano, resting on my elbows.</p><p>No matter where we are, or what he\u2019s singing, Jake\u2019s voice does incredible things to me. It\u2019s like pure, hot sex listening to him. His voice touches parts of me I didn\u2019t even know existed. Parts of me that belong only to him. That will only ever belong to him.</p><p>Watching the way he moves his fingers over the keys makes me want his hands on me so very badly.</p><p>I press my thighs together.</p><p>\u201cJake...\u201d I trace my fingertip over the smooth surface of the piano. \u201cWill you ever one day write a song about us? About me?\u201d</p><p>He stops playing and stares at me. \u201cEvery song I\u2019ve ever written was about you in some way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d My eyes widen.</p><p>His gaze is steady on me. \u201cHow do you think I wrote about love, Tru? You were the only person I ever loved. Every message of love in those songs came from you...because of you. Every line of loss came from losing you. Listen to them and you\u2019ll hear it. I\u2019m surprised you didn\u2019t before now.\u201d</p><p>He glances back down to the keys and starts tinkering with them. I\u2019m getting the distinct impression he\u2019s disappointed that I didn\u2019t know.</p><p>I shift, uneasy. \u201cI guess when I was listening to your music, I thought you didn\u2019t care about me.\u201d Turning away, I rest my back against the piano and stare across the darkened room.</p><p>\u201cI hate that you thought that.\u201d His voice is soft behind me. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t have been further from the truth.\u201d</p><p>Turning back to him, wanting to stop this conversation before it starts, I say, \u201cI liked the sound of the song you were playing before. Is it new?\u201d</p><p>He nods.</p><p>\u201cWill you play it for me now?\u201d</p><p>He stares at me for a long moment and shakes his head. \u201cIt\u2019s not finished. I\u2019ll play it for you when it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I reach over and touch his face with the tip of my index finger. I draw a path across his cheekbone, up over his nose, then trace the line of his brow.</p><p>Jake closes his eyes, breathing shallow. Then he reaches up, taking hold of my wrist. He draws me to him, putting me between him and the piano.</p><p>He rests his forehead against my stomach. I run my fingers into his hair, holding him to me. His deep breaths are hot on my skin through the thin fabric of my shirt. In and out he breathes.</p><p>Something\u2019s bothering him. I knew it before in his smile, but I know it more so now.</p><p>I can see it in the tense line of his shoulders. Feel it with every deep breath he takes.</p><p>\u201cHow was your night?\u201d Jake asks, muffled, into my top.</p><p>\u201cGood, we had fun. How was yours?\u201d</p><p>He lifts his shoulders. \u201cStandard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby, what\u2019s bothering you?\u201d I press my fingers into his tense shoulders.</p><p>Lifting his head, staring up at me in the darkness, he grips my waist.</p><p>Without a word, he stands and picks me up, sitting me on the piano. The keys tinkle as I rest my feet on them.</p><p>Leaning into me, he buries his face in my neck. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk.\u201d He surprises me by taking a shaky breath. \u201cI just need to be inside you, Tru. Deep inside you.\u201d</p><p>His words shiver through me. I know that whatever is bothering him right now, he needs to forget, in me.</p><p>His hands push my skirt high up my legs. He groans at the sight of my hold-ups and runs a finger around the edge of one, then roughly pushes my thighs apart and grabs my ass, pulling me to him. He kisses me.</p><p>My breathing stutters at the intensity of him, the feel of his erection pressing against me, his tongue hard in my mouth. It\u2019s a heady combination. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Reaching for my shirt, he rips it open. The buttons scatter, pinging across the piano, hitting the floor.</p><p>Jake pushes the shirt down my arms. Taking over, I free it, tossing it aside.</p><p>His hand moves over my breast, tracing the edge of the cup of my bra. He runs his finger in and over the tip of my nipple. The gentle contact makes me gasp.</p><p>His hand leaves me, only to push his pyjama bottoms down, freeing his erection.</p> <p>He nudges it against my sex, his eyes burning into mine, filled with a hurt I don\u2019t understand.</p><p>\u201cJake...,\u201d I whisper, but he cuts me off, crushing his mouth to mine. He tears my panties off and thrusts his hungry cock inside me.</p><p>I cry out in pleasure at the sudden invasion. Jake grabs a tight hold of my hips, pinning me where he wants me, and he starts fucking me. His mouth on my neck, teeth biting, tongue licking, soothing.</p><p>With each hard thrust, the keys on the piano groan their own frustrated, chaotic chord. I can feel him trying to get deeper in me, pushing against me, almost desperate to find his escape, while my sounds of pleasure echo around the library.</p><p>\u201cLie back,\u201d he growls in my ear.</p> <p>My bare back hits the cool piano at his command. I can barely feel the chill because I\u2019m so absolutely taken with Jake. Watching the hunger and need for me that\u2019s consuming him in this moment. There is only him and me. We\u2019re our own island, and nothing and no one can touch us. And I know it\u2019s exactly where he needs to be right now.</p><p>Jake lifts my legs higher, pulling me closer, and the instant he touches the spot in me that only he can, an orgasm tears through me.</p><p>But Jake\u2019s not done, as he continues to chase his own climax, fucking me, hard and rough. His teeth grit, jaw clenches, eyes burning with hunger, the moonlight silhouetting him, and in this moment he has never looked more sexy to me.</p><p>When he meets his moment, throwing his head back, his face tight in release, he drives his orgasm out, hips jerking against me, pumping himself into me, and I come again, pulsing tightly around his cock.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d he says as my muscles relax around him, us both trying to catch our breath.</p><p>He leans down, resting his chest against me. His head on my breasts, he stays inside me.</p> <p>I trace my finger around the shell of his ear, listening to his shallow breaths, feeling the lingering frustration in him like it\u2019s my own.</p><p>\u201cTalk to me,\u201d I murmur.</p><p>He lifts his head, resting his chin on my breast. He stares into my eyes.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go to bed.\u201d Rising, he pulls out of me carefully.</p><p>Jake reaches a hand to me and eases me off the piano. He keeps hold of my hand all the way back to our bedroom.</p><p>Removing the clothes I\u2019m left with\u2014my bra, skirt, and hold-ups\u2014I grab one of Jake\u2019s T-shirts from the wardrobe and put it on.</p><p>When I return, he\u2019s already in bed, so I climb in beside him and snuggle up to his warm, hard body.</p><p>He exhales heavily, and I feel his hot breath brush over my skin.</p> <p>\u201cJonny\u2019s mom called while you were out.\u201d</p><p>So this is what\u2019s eating at him. This is why he just fucked me so desperately on the piano.</p><p>I tilt my head back to him. \u201cWhat did she want?\u201d</p><p>He rubs his hand over his hair, and stares up at the dark ceiling. \u201cShe saw the press release about Smith joining the band.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>His eyes meet mine in the darkness. \u201cI hadn\u2019t called to tell her it was happening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did she take it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe yelled. She cried. She\u2019s hurt, and she has a right to be. I fucked up. I should have told her. I didn\u2019t think. I hate that I didn\u2019t. I feel like such a fuckin\u2019 bastard.\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cShe said I\u2019m heartless and selfish...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Jake, no...\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s right. I am. But she said...\u201d He takes a shaky breath. \u201cShe said I was replacing Jonny. That I\u2019d forgotten about him. That putting Smith in the band is erasing Jonny from it, that I\u2019m acting like he never existed. She said Jonny would never have done that if it had been me who had died. And she\u2019s right. He wouldn\u2019t have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s bullshit.\u201d I move around onto my front so I can talk directly to him. \u201cShe\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m trembling on the inside with the anger I feel. I know she lost her son and is grieving, but she has no right to hurt Jake this way.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think she is, Tru.\u201d He shakes his head again, looking away. \u201cBut I haven\u2019t forgotten him.\u201d His voice is so quiet, as his eyes return to mine. \u201cHow could I? But I\u2019ve just been so happy with you and the baby...when I asked Smith to become a permanent member, it was purely a business decision. I wasn\u2019t trying to hurt anyone. Least of all Jonny\u2019s parents. But I should have called.\u201d</p><p>Sitting up, I straddle his waist and trap his face between my hands, forcing him to look at me. I can see the hurt glistening in his eyes, and it makes every fibre of me ache.</p><p>\u201cYou listen to me, Jake Wethers. You haven\u2019t got a malicious bone in your body. Yes, you made a mistake by not calling, but I think even if you had called, she would have reacted the same. She lost her son and she\u2019s still angry and hurting about that. But she\u2019s wrong when she says that you\u2019re replacing Jonny. You\u2019re not. If you\u2019d forgotten him, then the show you\u2019re doing next week to officially bring Smith into the band, well, you wouldn\u2019t be donating the proceeds to a charity that provides support to people affected by car accidents, and their families, would you? You\u2019re just doing what\u2019s right for the band now. That\u2019s what Jonny would want, and would have done, if he was in your shoes.\u201d</p><p>Jake\u2019s chest expands on a breath. He closes his eyes, his head gently shaking.</p><p>I know I\u2019m not reaching him. This isn\u2019t going to fix it for him. I know it\u2019ll eat away at him. That\u2019s Jake. The Jake only I know.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go see her to talk it through in person? It\u2019s always better face-to-face than on the telephone. Sometimes you just need to see the person\u2019s face, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s in New York.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a few hours on a plane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix. And I\u2019ve got meetings tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRearrange them. Going out there will show her you care. I\u2019ll come with you if you want. We can stay in a hotel, spend some time with his mum and dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d do that for me?\u201d</p><p>I look down at him, surprised. \u201cI\u2019d do anything for you, Jake. Don\u2019t you know that by now?\u201d</p><p>He presses his hands against my stomach, moving them outward, settling on my waist. \u201cI love you so fuckin\u2019 much, Tru.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I lie down on him and love the feel of his arms as they come around me, holding me tight to him. \u201cI love you too.\u201d I kiss his biceps. \u201cSo we\u2019re going to New York tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to New York tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER SIXTEEN</p><p>I\u2019m standing side stage at the Wiltern Theater in West LA with Stuart, Carly, and Dave. The guys are onstage playing. This is their welcoming gig for Smith.</p><p>It\u2019s a small show with only two thousand fans. The tickets were expensive, so this show is seating only hard-core TMS fans. There are quite a few celebrities here as well. Yes, I am feeling starstruck by some of them.</p><p>All the proceeds from tonight are going to a charity for the victims of road accidents. It\u2019s an important charity to Jake because of how Jonny died.</p><p>I think this is his way of letting himself feel okay about Smith being a permanent fixture in TMS now.</p><p>We went to see Lyn and Bob, Jonny\u2019s mum and dad, last week in New York. I\u2019m so glad we did.</p><p>Jake made his peace with Lyn. Their talk was long overdue, and something they both needed.</p><p>I spent time chatting with Bob in the kitchen while Jake and Lyn talked in the living room. Such a nice man. He regaled me with stories of the things Jake and Jonny used to get up to when they were teenagers. They were bad boys with good hearts. That\u2019s exactly what Jake still is.</p><p>Bob also makes the best tea known to man, and he fed me Lyn\u2019s homemade biscuits. I have seriously never tasted a biscuit as good.</p><p>After we left Lyn and Bob\u2019s, Jake and I visited Jonny\u2019s grave at Woodlawn Cemetery, at my suggestion.</p><p>He was reluctant, but I knew he needed to. The last time he\u2019d been there was for the funeral.</p><p>I left Jake alone with Jonny for a time and took a walk. It\u2019s a beautiful place. Peaceful, as a place like that should be.</p><p>After the visit, I could feel Jake\u2019s relief. He seemed freer, and I knew I had done the right thing by encouraging him to go.</p><p>We stayed in New York for a few days, shopping and going out for dinner. It was relaxing, and I enjoyed every minute of being there with him. Then again, I could be in a dump with Jake and still be happy.</p><p>The only unfortunate thing about our trip was that Susie and Dale were away on holiday, as we could have visited them too. Maybe it was a blessing in disguise. I think the visit with Lyn and Bob was all Jake could handle at that point.</p><p>Jake has ongoing issues with his mum, and that\u2019s my next goal\u2014to help fix them. I\u2019m hoping Christmas will be just the right time. I want everyone right before our baby arrives.</p><p>As it\u2019s a special show, the guys are playing a few unreleased songs from the new album, which is scheduled for release next autumn. I know what a new album means: it means touring.</p><p>And our baby is due in July.</p><p>I don\u2019t want Jake to delay the album release. This isn\u2019t just about him and me and our life. It\u2019s about Tom, Denny, and Smith too. We\u2019re going to have to figure out what to do. But something tells me I\u2019m going to be going on tour with a newborn next year.</p><p>At the moment, I\u2019m not thinking about that. I\u2019m just enjoying the here and now.</p><p>And right now life is amazing.</p><p>I scan the packed theatre, watching the crowd singing along as Jake belts out one of their more recent tracks, \u201cRevved.\u201d</p><p>The crowd is pumped. The guys are bouncing off each other brilliantly. Jake is in top form, vocally. Tom is playing his bass like he\u2019s about to have sex with it any minute. Denny is on fire behind the drums, and Smith is finally relaxed. I\u2019m finally seeing that big Southern personality of his, up here on the stage.</p><p>Smith has found his place among them now, and I\u2019m so happy for him. He deserves it.</p><p>I see how proud Carly is by the look on her face.</p><p>I turn to watch Jake sing. He is dripping sex, hands around the microphone, lips singing the words like he\u2019s making love to them. My panties are damp just watching him.</p><p>He\u2019s mine. That stunningly talented, beautiful man is all mine.</p><p>I run my fingers over my tummy and whisper to the baby, \u201cYou hear that? That\u2019s your daddy up there singing.\u201d</p><p>As I lift my eyes, I catch Stuart watching me, smiling.</p><p>He wraps his arm around my shoulders, pulling me to his side. \u201cHe\u2019s doing good, huh?\u201d He nods in the direction of Jake.</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d I say, smiling. \u201cHe\u2019s on fire tonight.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t wait to get him naked later.</p><p>My libido is set to high now that I\u2019m pregnant. We\u2019ve been having sex everywhere. Whenever and wherever we can. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean onstage,\u201d Stuart says. \u201cThat\u2019s the one place you can always guarantee Jake will be okay. I meant with the baby. Jake is one person I never figured for having kids. But that was before you. I thought he was happy when you came back into his life, but this, with your being pregnant, he\u2019s like sickly happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean like you are with Josh.\u201d I poke him in the ribs.</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d He presses a kiss to my head. \u201cJake\u2019s found his home. And I think...\u201d He looks a little abashed. \u201cWell, I think I might have found mine, chica.\u201d</p><p>My heart lifts. \u201cThat serious, huh?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think so.\u201d</p><p>I wrap my arms around his waist, hugging him.</p><p>I cannot wait to meet hot Dr. Josh at Jake\u2019s party. I\u2019m almost as excited about that as I am the party.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wanted, gorgeous.\u201d Stuart lifts his arm from my shoulders, nudging me forward with his hip.</p><p>I look from Stuart straight ahead, to see Jake walking toward me, grinning, guitar slung around his back, gesturing for me to go to him with his outstretched hand.</p> <p>No bloody way. Not in a million years am I stepping out onstage in front of two thousand people.</p><p>I shake my head a firm no.</p><p>Narrowing those bright blue eyes on mine, he gets a look of determination.</p><p>I know that look. It\u2019s the one that usually means he gets his own way.</p><p>Removing my arms from around Stuart, I take a step back, readying for a quick escape, but Stuart catches the small of my back with his hand and gently pushes me forward, straight into Jake.</p><p>I give Stuart a \u201cyou\u2019re in for it later\u201d look. He starts laughing.</p> <p>Jake wraps a firm arm around my waist and steers me onstage.</p><p>\u201cWhat are doing?\u201d I hiss into his ear, stumbling on my heels.</p><p>\u201cShowing off my girl,\u201d he says, smiling down at me.</p><p>My whole body is shaking. I daren\u2019t look out at all the people. I can\u2019t believe he\u2019s brought me out here. I\u2019m going to bloody kill him.</p><p>Reaching the mike, Jake addresses the crowd. \u201cI\u2019m sure you all know my girl, Tru.\u201d He gestures to me as some whistles and catcalls come from the audience. My knees start knocking together. \u201cSay hello to LA\u2019s finest, baby.\u201d He looks at me expectantly.</p><p>Seeing no way out of this, I lift my hand and, like a complete twat, wave to two thousand strangers, mumbling hello into the mike.</p><p>A round of cheers and whistles comes from the crowd, and my face goes beet red.</p><p>He is so fucking dead when I get him home.</p> <p>Moving the mike back to him, Jake says, \u201cWe have another new song off the album that we\u2019re going to perform now. Seeing as I wrote the song about my girl, I thought she should be up here the first time I sing it.\u201d</p><p>My head snaps around to him.</p><p>He wrote a song about me?</p><p>Jake meets my eyes, but I can\u2019t read them.</p><p>I start to feel a weird sense of discomfort in my chest.</p><p>He wrote a song for me because of what I said that night at the piano. Because I hadn\u2019t heard his words for me in any of his other songs.</p><p>I don\u2019t know whether to kiss him for the thoughtfulness or to cry because he wrote me a song out of pity.</p><p>Out of my peripheral, I see a couple of roadies bringing a small piano onstage. Jake leads me to the piano and hands off his guitar. The bench is big enough to seat us both, and Jake pulls me down to sit beside him. The good thing is he\u2019s stage-facing, so at least I can hide a little behind his body.</p><p>I glance up at Denny behind the drum kit, and he gives me a knowing smile.</p><p>I give him a \u201cyou\u2019re dead next after Jake and Stuart\u201d look.</p><p>Denny chuckles, shaking his head at me.</p><p>I look back to Jake, just as he leans toward the fixed mike on the piano, and says, in that sexy, throaty voice of his, \u201cOkay, this one is called \u2018Everything Is You\u2019...\u201d He slides his eyes to me. \u201cThis one is all yours, baby.\u201d</p><p>Pressing down on the keys, Jake starts to play a gentle melody...</p><p>I saw her there, standing twenty feet away, feeling like we were still an ocean apart,</p><p>But there was no turning back, she had to be mine,</p><p>Knew she\u2019d be mine,</p><p>I brought her in, chased her for a while, until she broke down,</p><p>Tell me you\u2019re mine, that you\u2019ll always be mine.</p><p>Take that chance with me,</p><p>I\u2019ll let you down, I know,</p><p>But I\u2019ll fix it too, because everything is you,</p><p>Everything is you.</p><p>She made her way to my bed, already soul deep inside me,</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s always been you,\u201d I said. \u201cThe only one on my mind,\u201d</p><p>But still I got wild, I broke the rule,</p><p>She left, taking everything with her.</p><p>Take that chance with me,</p><p>I\u2019ll let you down, I know,</p><p>But I\u2019ll fix it too, because everything is you,</p><p>Everything is you.</p><p>Like a beggar I pleaded for my home,</p><p>Words were the only way I knew how,</p><p>Lighting the sky with pink, she turned back and smiled,</p><p>I got you, baby, always mine, take me home.</p><p>Everything is you,</p><p>No matter where we are, with you by my side, I can walk these weak white-lined streets blind,</p><p>You\u2019re my guide. My everything.</p><p>Now with that new beating heart inside, you\u2019ve given me eternity,</p><p>Forever is now. And everything is you.</p><p>It\u2019s the song he was playing at the piano that night.</p><p>He didn\u2019t write it because of what I said. He\u2019d already written it.</p><p>That\u2019s why he wouldn\u2019t play it for me that night. He wanted to surprise me.</p><p>My eyes have not left him, and his have been on mine for most of the song.</p><p>My teeth are biting down on my wobbly lip, eyes heavy with tears. For the whole time, it has felt like there is no one else in the theatre but Jake and me.</p><p>But for me, there is no one but him. He is all I see, and all I have seen since I walked into that hotel room all those months ago.</p><p>The song has touched me so deeply that, not caring where we are, the instant his fingers leave the keys, I grab his face, pulling him to me, and I kiss him with every fibre of my being.</p><p>Jake\u2019s hand goes around the back of my neck, fingers tangling in my hair, his tongue moving in my mouth, he kisses me back with everything he has.</p><p>I\u2019m aware of the whistles and cheering around us, but I don\u2019t care. All I care about is Jake. My lovely, sweet, beautiful Jake.</p><p>Coming to, we break from each other, eyes locked, panting, Jake wearing that fuck-hot smile of his. I know exactly what he\u2019s thinking. I also know exactly what he would be doing to me right now if this place were empty.</p><p>\u201cYou wrote me a song,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>He nods. \u201cI wrote it a while ago. But I just made some recent changes to it.\u201d</p><p>The baby. The line at the end of the song.</p><p>Now with that new beating heart inside, you\u2019ve given me eternity.</p><p>My heart swells with happiness.</p><p>I never knew happiness existed like I have with Jake. I never, ever want to lose this feeling.</p><p>Turning to the mike, his voice decadent with sex, he says, \u201cI think she likes the song. What do you guys say?\u201d</p><p>Tilting his head toward me, he grins, eyes alive, and the crowd goes wild.</p><p>I can\u2019t stop the smile beaming on my face. All I want is for him to play the song again.</p><p>Jake stands and offers me his hand. \u201cTake a bow for your audience, baby.\u201d</p><p>Standing beside him, I give a little curtsey, and the crowd\u2019s cheers grow louder.</p><p>I even hear a whistle and cheer come from Tom. I glance at him and see he\u2019s smiling.</p><p>I knew there was a romantic buried deep inside the man whore.</p><p>I grin at him, and instead of giving me a sarcastic look or comment like he normally would, he winks and smiles.</p><p>As I turn to make my exit from the stage, Jake pulls back on my hand and whispers in my ear, \u201cI meant every word of that song. You know that, right?\u201d</p><p>Leaning back a fraction, I meet his eyes. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>And I do. I really and truly do know the depth of his feelings for me. Any tiny remaining doubt I may have had about Jake\u2019s feelings for me disappeared with that song.</p><p>He presses the side of his face to mine, cheek to cheek. I close my eyes, revelling in the feel of him, intoxicated by his special Jake scent.</p><p>\u201cStraight to the limo after the set, sweetheart,\u201d he murmurs, breath hot on my skin. Tingling sensations ripple down my body. \u201cIn it, on it, anywhere and any way I can have you.\u201d</p><p>Stepping back, I say, \u201cThe limo it is.\u201d I give him a sexy smile and slink offstage, feeling more confident than I ever knew possible, to wait for my limo-sex date with my gorgeous, sexy Jake.</p><p>CHAPTER SEVENTEEN</p><p>You promise you can\u2019t see anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019ve blindfolded me,\u201d Jake complains.</p><p>\u201cMakes a change, huh?\u201d I whisper in his ear.</p><p>I feel him shiver.</p><p>Sliding my hands down his arms, I slip my hands in his and lead him forward as I take a step back, closer to the door.</p><p>Releasing a hand, I reach back. Catching the handle, I open the door.</p><p>I guide him through the doorway.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I stand in front of him, taking a deep breath. \u201cI wanted to give you your present before we go out for dinner, because it\u2019s been killing me waiting all day as it is, and I didn\u2019t want to wait any longer.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s only partly true. The other reason I wanted him to have it now is because we\u2019ll be at the surprise party late into the night.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019m going to love it, Tru,\u201d he says.</p><p>Cocking my head to the side, I say, \u201cHow do you know?\u201d He can\u2019t have seen it, because I just took it out of hiding and put it in here.</p><p>I peer close to his face, making sure he can\u2019t see through the blindfold.</p><p>As I near, his warm breath blows over my skin, igniting me. He smells so totally divine that I have the urge to kiss him.</p><p>Without warning, he grabs my face and kisses me. I melt into him, wrapping my arms around his waist.</p><p>Under my lips he says, \u201cI know because I know you. Anything you get me I will love, because it came from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmooth talker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet your sweet ass I am. Now can I have my gift?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, Mr. Impatient,\u201d I say, laughing.</p><p>I free the blindfold from Jake\u2019s eyes and stand beside him, watching with butterflies as he locks onto his present a few feet away.</p><p>He takes a step closer. \u201cIs that...is that my old Strat?\u201d His voice sounds quiet.</p><p>He turns to me.</p><p>I nod.</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d His mouth is open. \u201cI\u2014I thought it would have been long gone. I mean, after\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy dad kept it all these years.\u201d I run my tongue over my dry lips. \u201cYou know what he\u2019s like. He never could get rid of a guitar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I...\u201d He looks back at the guitar. Then he turns back to me, and I see the emotion on his face. It takes my breath away. \u201cMy mom wouldn\u2019t let me take it...\u201d He starts to tell me the story I already know. \u201c...and everything had already been shipped to New York, and I thought I\u2019d be able to take it on the plane with me, but she said I couldn\u2019t and I had to leave it behind...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember.\u201d I bite my lip. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Moving from me, he goes to the guitar sitting in its new stand and crouches down.</p><p>I go over and kneel beside him.</p><p>\u201cIt was a little worn,\u201d I explain. \u201cIt\u2019d been in the garage at Mum and Dad\u2019s, cased up, but the damp gets in, you know, so I had Dad get it reconditioned and put brand-new strings on. Then he shipped it over to me, and then...\u201d I bite my lip nervously. \u201cWell, I had a little artwork done on it.\u201d I point to the Mighty Storm\u2019s band logo on the face. \u201cI hope that was okay.\u201d</p><p>Jake runs his finger over the emblem. \u201cIt\u2019s more than okay.\u201d His voice sounds choked with emotion.</p> <p>Hearing him sound this way sends goose bumps racing over my skin.</p><p>\u201cI had a little something else added.\u201d Carefully, I lift the guitar from the stand. Resting it over Jake\u2019s knees, I turn it over to show him the artwork on the back.</p><p>~ Love is just a word until someone comes along and gives it meaning ~</p><p>Jake &amp; Tru</p><p>August 31st, 1989</p> <p>July 21st, 2012</p><p>\u201cThe first date is\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe date you moved next door to me,\u201d he finishes. \u201cThe second, the day we reconnected at the interview.\u201d He meets my eyes, and the intensity in his gaze marks me, branding me with the love I know he feels for me.</p><p>\u201cI thought we could mark each memorable date we have on it. The next one I thought could be the day the baby\u2019s born.\u201d I run my fingers over my stomach. \u201cThen our wedding day.\u201d</p><p>Jake looks down at the guitar and runs the tip of his index finger over the engraving.</p><p>\u201cThe quote is from Aleph by Paulo Coelo.\u201d I indicate the worn copy on my bedside cabinet. \u201cHe wrote The Alchemist. Do you remember when we read it in school for English?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI do,\u201d he says, nodding. \u201cWe worked on the assignment together, and I got an A, thanks to you.\u201d He winks, then turns the guitar right side up and starts strumming.</p><p>\u201cDRs?\u201d he asks in reference to the strings.</p><p>\u201cYou know my dad, he likes the best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re all I use,\u201d he says, eyes down on the guitar, as he strums the chords from the Rolling Stones\u2019 \u201cHonky Tonk Woman.\u201d \u201cYour dad was my musical influence, Tru. I listened to everything he said and took it in, because he knows his shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe misses playing. He loves teaching, but he loves being in the thick of it more. He loved being at the concert with you in Spain that day. It\u2019s all he\u2019s gone on about since.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy best childhood memories consist of you, this guitar, and your dad...\u201d His thoughts trail, and he starts to hum the lyrics, then stops. \u201cDo you think he might be interested, when I do finally tour again, in coming with us?\u201d</p><p>My face lights up as my heart gets all warm and fuzzy. \u201cI think he would love that. My mum, not so much!\u201d I laugh. \u201cBut you would make my dad\u2019s year if you asked him.\u201d I reach out and touch his arm.</p><p>His eyes smile. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to him at Christmas about it.\u201d He puts the guitar back in its stand, and then, resting down on his knees, he pulls me into his lap so I\u2019m straddling him and wraps his arms around my waist. \u201cThank you for the guitar. It\u2019s the best gift I have ever received.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad.\u201d I smile. \u201cHappy birthday, baby.\u201d I kiss the corner of his mouth.</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d He shifts his face, capturing my lips with his, and kisses me. \u201cSo fuckin\u2019 much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too,\u201d I whisper, running my fingers into his hair. \u201cSo I was thinking...when we\u2019re in bed later, after you\u2019ve had your dirty way with me, you could play me some of the old songs you used to play on it.\u201d</p><p>A wicked grin spreads over his lips, making him look even more edible. \u201cYou know I was totally trying to seduce you with some of those songs I played when we were teenagers.\u201d</p><p>I start laughing. \u201cYou were trying to seduce me with \u2018Honky Tonk Woman\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not that one.\u201d He runs his fingers down my spine. I shiver under his touch. \u201cBut definitely \u2018Touch Me.\u2019\u201d</p><p>I laugh again. \u201cAnd I thought you were just crushing on Jim Morrison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly you, baby. Only ever you.\u201d His face goes serious. \u201cYou know, back then, this was how I dreamed my life would be, what I have right now with you. Marrying you. Growing old with you. When we parted\u201d\u2014he lifts his shoulders\u2014\u201cI figured that dream was gone forever...I\u2019m so glad I got a second chance at this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d I lift my hand and brush the length of his eyebrow with my fingertip, then the bridge of his nose. His eyes close on a soft sigh. I lean forward just a little and kiss his lips gently. \u201cTime for birthday present number two.\u201d</p><p>Jake\u2019s eyes flick open. \u201cI get another present?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, silly.\u201d I rise to stand and go over to my dressing table, retrieving the gift box. I walk over to the bed, where he\u2019s now sitting, waiting for me.</p><p>I sit on the bed beside him, facing him. \u201cThis is from me and the baby.\u201d I hand the small box to him.</p><p>Taking it from me, Jake pulls the blue ribbon off the box and lifts the lid. He lifts the box sitting inside and cracks it open.</p><p>He smiles. \u201cYou bought me a Rolex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe bought you a Rolex,\u201d I say, tilting my head to my tummy. \u201cIt\u2019s vintage, nineteen eighty-five. Since I was going for memorabilia, I thought I would get something from the year you were born.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, really.\u201d He gives me an encouraging look before he leans in, bending his head down to my stomach. \u201cThank you,\u201d he says to the baby and presses a kiss there.</p><p>Touched by his sentiment, feeling like I might burst into tears any second, I add levity to the situation. \u201cHey, don\u2019t be giving the baby all the credit. I was the one hauling ass around the shops to find it.\u201d I grin.</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t mean it,\u201d he says to my stomach in all seriousness. \u201cI know it was all your idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a geek!\u201d I laugh, pushing his head away.</p><p>\u201cJust having a one-on-one with my kid.\u201d He smiles, sitting up.</p><p>He starts to take the watch out of the box.</p><p>\u201cI had it engraved too. I was on a bit of a theme.\u201d I bite down on a smile.</p><p>He gives me a curious look, and removing the watch from the box, he turns it over.</p><p>Everything Is You</p><p>J.W.</p><p>2012</p><p>\u201cFor the song,\u201d I say.</p><p>He nods silently, staring down at the watch.</p><p>\u201cI mean, if you hate the engraving, if it\u2019s too much, I\u2019m sure I can get it removed...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love it.\u201d He presses his finger over my lip. \u201cThe watch. The engraving. The guitar. You. I love you more than I knew possible, Tru.\u201d</p><p>My heart is racing behind my ribs. I take hold of his hand on my mouth and kiss his finger. \u201cI know I didn\u2019t buy you a house...\u201d I smile lightly. \u201cBut I was hoping these gifts would go to making up for the last twelve years of missed birthdays, like you\u2019ve been doing for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey surpass them. But like I told you in Paris, I got all my twelve the moment you agreed to be mine.\u201d</p><p>I slide my fingers between his, linking our hands. I glance at the clock. \u201cWe should get going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see.\u201d I give him a teasing smile, getting off the bed.</p><p>\u201cHold on,\u201d Jake says. He takes his watch off\u2014the one that probably cost ten times more\u2014and puts on the Rolex. My heart fills with happiness, fitting to burst in my chest.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready now.\u201d He stands, taking hold of my hand, and I lead him out of the bedroom.</p><p>\u201cYou gave Dave the night off?\u201d He doesn\u2019t sound pleased.</p><p>I pull out of the drive, waving bye to Jackson. \u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>He sighs loudly.</p><p>\u201cJake, I\u2019m out with you. Nothing is going to happen to me. I wish you\u2019d relax on this.\u201d</p><p>Dave is waiting at the party with everyone else. No way was I having him or Ben working tonight. They are guests at Jake\u2019s party just like everyone else. They might work for him, but they\u2019re his friends too. More like family at times. They\u2019re both bringing their wives, who I\u2019m looking forward to meeting.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll never relax when it comes to your or our baby\u2019s safety.\u201d</p><p>He sounds pissed. I don\u2019t want him worked up tonight of all nights.</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d I soften my tone. \u201cIn the future I\u2019ll consult you about this kind of thing, okay?\u201d I give him a quick doe-eyed look.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that,\u201d he says, trying to remain pissed off, but I can see him giving in already.</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d I give him the same look again.</p><p>\u201cYou know what. The wide-eyed, gorgeous stare. The one you think gets you out of everything.\u201d</p><p>Grinning, staring out at the road ahead, I say, \u201cIt does get me out of everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the fuckin\u2019 problem,\u201d he mutters. Reaching over, he starts fiddling with the iPod.</p><p>\u201cCan you put on some of the songs we used to listen to when we were kids?\u201d I\u2019m feeling a little nostalgic after our trip down memory lane.</p><p>Jake scrolls through the listings, and then I hear the Doors\u2019 \u201cTouch Me.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help but laugh. \u201cStarting the night off as you mean to go on, Wethers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbso-fucking-lutely.\u201d He grins that fuck-hot grin of his, making me squirm in my seat. I want to pull the car over right now and do what we did after the show at the Wiltern. But I somehow refrain from doing so and step on the gas, heading downtown to Pizza Hut.</p><p>I see his face light up as I pull into the parking lot at Pizza Hut.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got my old Strat back, a vintage Rolex on my wrist, and now I\u2019m gonna be having Pizza Hut with my hot girl. Could this birthday get any better?\u201d</p><p>Turning the engine off, I whisper, \u201cI hope so.\u201d</p><p>With butterflies swarming my stomach, I climb out of the car, lock it, and put the keys in my purse.</p><p>Jake meets me around the front of the car.</p><p>Looking at the darkened windows of the building, he says, \u201cSweetheart, it looks closed. Don\u2019t worry, we can go somewhere else.\u201d</p><p>He starts to turn back to the car.</p><p>\u201cNo, let\u2019s just check it out.\u201d Taking him by the hand, I lead him toward the door. \u201cIt\u2019ll be open. This is Pizza Hut, they never close. Maybe the lights just went out or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPizza Hut in the dark...I can work with that,\u201d I hear him say from behind me, with sex in his voice.</p><p>I resist the urge to turn around, knowing my face will probably give me away if I do.</p><p>I push open the door and lead Jake through. \u201cHello?\u201d I call out to let Stuart know to flick on the lights.</p><p>On cue, all the lights flash on, and we\u2019re met by our family and friends, calling out, \u201cSURPRISE!\u201d</p><p>The look on Jake\u2019s face is amazing. He looks overwhelmed and surprised, but best of all, happy. He looks so very happy. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The power of a surprise party.</p><p>I throw my arms around his neck and hug him. \u201cHappy birthday, baby,\u201d I sing in his ear.</p><p>\u201cYou threw me a surprise party?\u201d His arms go around my waist. \u201cAt Pizza Hut?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d I lean back, staring into his face. \u201cWith Stuart\u2019s and Carly\u2019s help.

I know Dale didn\u2019t mean any harm using the word \u201cson,\u201d but it must still feel strange for Jake to hear it.</p><p>I exhale in pure relief when I see my mum and dad heading toward us.</p><p>\u201cDaddy!\u201d I beam, breaking away from Jake to give him a big hug. \u201cMama!\u201d I reach an arm out and pull her into the hug.</p><p>\u201cHey, baby girl,\u201d Dad says, hugging me back.</p> <p>\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d Mum asks.</p><p>She\u2019s always asking since she found out I\u2019m pregnant.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, Mama.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo morning sickness?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFatigue?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a little tired, but overall I\u2019m good.\u201d I smile.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lucky. I was sick as a dog when I was pregnant with you.\u201d She tucks my hair behind my ear. \u201cHas Jake stopped smoking?\u201d</p> <p>Hearing his name, Jake turns to us.</p><p>\u201cNo, Mama, he hasn\u2019t, but he doesn\u2019t smoke anywhere near me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPassive smoke can be harmful to a baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMama...,\u201d I warn.</p><p>\u201cGood to see you, Billy,\u201d Jake says. \u201cEva.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHappy birthday,\u201d Mum says, almost cracking a smile at Jake.</p><p>\u201cYeah, happy birthday, son,\u201d Dad adds, putting an arm around Jake.</p><p>I notice it doesn\u2019t seem to bother Jake that my dad called him son.</p><p>\u201cYou like the guitar?\u201d Dad asks.</p><p>\u201cYeah, thank you for keeping it all these years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever could get rid of a guitar,\u201d Dad says. \u201cWe got you a little something. It\u2019s not much...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Jake says.</p><p>Dad waves it off. \u201cIt\u2019s over there with the rest of the presents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDale\u2019s and my gift is over there too,\u201d Susie says, gesturing to the table. \u201cDo you want to open it now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll open it later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, no problem,\u201d Susie replies, but I see the disappointment in her eyes.</p><p>He\u2019s still angry that she came to Paul\u2019s funeral only after I called her. I really need to fix this rift, and fast.</p><p>\u201cGo open your present from your mum.\u201d I nudge him with my hip.</p><p>Jake stares down at me, giving me a less-than-impressed look, then turns to his mum. \u201cSure, okay.\u201d</p><p>I watch Jake follow Susie and Dale to the gift table.</p><p>My mum gives me a \u201cwhat gives there?\u201d look. I shrug.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going over to see Simone. See you in a bit.\u201d</p><p>I leave mum and dad and all but run to Simone.</p><p>This is the first time I\u2019ve seen her since New York.</p><p>She\u2019s with Denny and Tom. Denny has his arm around her waist, and I swear this is the happiest I\u2019ve seen him in months.</p><p>Her face lights up when she sees me coming.</p><p>\u201cLook at you, all pregnant and gorgeous!\u201d She throws her arms around me.</p><p>\u201cNo bump yet.\u201d I pat my flat tummy. \u201cWon\u2019t be long, though, before I\u2019m big and round like a bowling ball.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still can\u2019t believe it! I can\u2019t wait to be Auntie Simone!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know!\u201d I beam at her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so good to see you, and you look flippin\u2019 gorgeous in that dress.\u201d I gesture to her deep-purple silk dress.</p><p>\u201cAh, this old thing? I just threw it on last-minute.\u201d She winks.</p><p>I know Simone. She\u2019ll have spent hours getting ready and changed her outfits about ten times before settling on this one.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019re here. I\u2019ve really missed you.\u201d I wrap my arms around her again. I feel awash with tears at her being here.</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d she says, sounding equally emotional.</p><p>\u201cI hate to break up this reunion of beauties,\u201d comes Stuart\u2019s voice from behind me, \u201cbut I need a quickie with the hostess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCock not your thing anymore?\u201d Tom says, grinning.</p><p>\u201cNo. I saw the state of yours and it put me off rubbing the lamp ever again.\u201d</p><p>Denny chokes on his drink and starts coughing. Simone pats him hard on the back.</p><p>\u201cI got it,\u201d Denny says, wiping his mouth.</p><p>\u201cHey, don\u2019t mock the genius simplicity of the tattoo,\u201d Tom says to Stuart.</p><p>\u201cPlease tell me girls haven\u2019t actually fallen for it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor it...on it.\u201d Tom grins.</p><p>\u201cMy baby can hear this crap you\u2019re talking.\u201d I lay my hands over my tummy. \u201cI don\u2019t want him or her corrupted by you pervy lot. Especially not you,\u201d I say pointedly to Tom.</p><p>He rolls his eyes. \u201cNumber one, this is Jake Wethers\u2019s baby we\u2019re talking about here. By DNA alone, it\u2019s designed to be corrupt. Two, it\u2019s a TMS baby and future rock star. Its rite of passage is to be corrupted by us. I\u2019m just teaching it early.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will not be teaching my child anything. What if I have a girl? I don\u2019t want my daughter corrupted by stories of your pervy indiscretions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way are you having a girl,\u201d Stuart pipes up from beside me.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause like pussy cat over there said, we\u2019re talking about Jake. With the level of testosterone in him alone, you\u2019re definitely having a boy, gorgeous.\u201d</p><p>I ponder this for a moment. A boy. A mini-Jake. I like the sound of that.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you want me for anyway?\u201d I ask Stuart, turning from the others.</p><p>\u201cI just wanted to check that this is all okay?\u201d He\u2019s gone light on the decorations, knowing Jake doesn\u2019t like too much fuss. There are some lanterns, balloons, and a few banners.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019ve done an amazing job. Thank you for doing this.\u201d I reach up on my tiptoes and give him a kiss on the cheek.</p><p>\u201cNo bother.\u201d He waves me off. \u201cThe cake is in the kitchen, ready for later; drinks on tap; and the pizzas will be out soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would I do without you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour life would absolutely fall to pieces.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich means you can\u2019t ever leave. You\u2019re stuck with us forever.\u201d I slip my arm through his.</p><p>\u201cWorks for me. I\u2019m kinda used to having you around now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so sweet.\u201d I squeeze his arm. \u201cSpeaking of sweet\u2014sorry, I mean hot\u2014is Dr. Josh here yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is. You wanna meet him now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I wanna meet him now.\u201d I give him a \u201cduh\u201d look. \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting ages to meet this guy. Lead me to the hotness.\u201d I gesture.</p><p>\u201cAnd this is why I haven\u2019t introduced him to you yet.\u201d He gives me a cheeky grin.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep it together for you. I won\u2019t geek out on him, I promise.\u201d I cross my finger over my heart.</p><p>Then I take the promise back almost immediately, as Stuart leads me toward a grade-A hottie. Like seriously hot. Blond hair, chiselled jaw, dark green eyes, golden skin. He\u2019s dressed in jeans and a fitted black shirt.</p><p>Holy fuck. He is shit-hot.</p><p>Now I know why Stuart calls him hot Dr. Josh.</p><p>\u201cJosh, this is Tru. Tru, close your mouth, and say hi to Josh.\u201d</p><p>Realising I\u2019m staring, mouth wide open, I quickly close it, my face going bright red.</p><p>\u201cHi, Tru, it\u2019s really nice to meet you.\u201d Josh smiles.</p><p>Holy fuck, he\u2019s got dimples too.</p><p>Why are all gay men so ridiculously hot? I remember the first time I saw Stuart, I nearly died of heart failure. Or maybe it\u2019s the fact that they\u2019re gay that makes them hotter?</p><p>Nah, they\u2019re just seriously hot. Stuart and Josh together look like an ad campaign for Armani.</p><p>\u201cHi, Josh.\u201d I smile, composing myself. \u201cIt\u2019s great to meet you. And I wasn\u2019t staring.\u201d I elbow Stuart. \u201cI was just admiring Josh\u2019s, um...shirt. It\u2019s a really nice shirt.\u201d</p><p>Josh looks down at his plain black shirt. \u201cThanks.\u201d He grins.</p><p>I feel a pair of arms come around my waist, and Jake presses a kiss to my cheek.</p><p>\u201cHey, baby.\u201d I turn my head to him. \u201cJake, meet Josh, Stuart\u2019s new boyfriend, who\u2019s wearing a black shirt.\u201d</p><p>Jake doesn\u2019t even blink at my introduction. He loosens an arm from around me and reaches over to shake Josh\u2019s hand. \u201cIt\u2019s good to finally meet you, man. Stuart never stops talking about you.\u201d</p><p>I see Stuart flush beet red and shoot daggers at Jake.</p><p>\u201cExcuse us a minute,\u201d Jake says. \u201cI\u2019ve just gotta steal my girl away for a little while.\u201d</p><p>Taking my hand, Jake leads me through the restaurant to an empty booth in the back, out of sight from everyone else.</p><p>He gestures for me to sit, so I slide in the seat.</p><p>\u201cEverything okay?\u201d I ask as Jake slides in beside me, but instead of answering me, he takes my face in his hands, leans into me, presses my back up against the wall, and kisses me.</p><p>I part my lips, and Jake\u2019s tongue snakes out to meet mine. Then he starts to kiss me ravenously. Like he\u2019s starved for me. I wrap my arms around his neck, winding my fingers into his hair.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that for?\u201d I ask breathlessly when he finally pulls away.</p><p>\u201cI was making the one birthday wish I always had come true.\u201d</p><p>My brow knits together.</p><p>At my confused expression, he continues. \u201cI always wanted to make out with you in a booth at every birthday dinner we had at Pizza Hut, but I never had the balls to do it. I just made it come true.\u201d</p><p>I stare at him, a little lost for words. Even when he stands and holds his hand out for me, I still can\u2019t think of a thing to say.</p><p>\u201cCome on, beautiful. Pizza\u2019s out, and we\u2019ve got guests to entertain.\u201d</p><p>Taking his hand, getting to my feet, I say, \u201cYou\u2019re totally gorgeous. You know that, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah, I absolutely know that.\u201d He winks, walking ahead, leaving me with a view of his very gorgeous ass.</p><p>He really is.</p><p>And I really am the luckiest girl in the world.</p><p>FIVE MONTHS LATER...</p><p>CHAPTER EIGHTEEN</p><p>Come back to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d I call to Jake in the bedroom. \u201cI\u2019m picking Simone up in half an hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean Dave\u2019s picking her up and you\u2019re just sitting in the car looking gorgeous.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes, boss,\u201d I mutter, giving my eyelashes one last coat of mascara. I put the wand back in, screw on the cap, and drop it in my makeup bag.</p><p>I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m bothering putting makeup on. It\u2019s only going to come off at the spa.</p><p>I leave the bathroom in just my underwear, fastening in my earrings. \u201cMy shadow will indeed be picking Simone up, while my fat ass sits in the car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not fat, you\u2019re pregnant. Hot, sexy pregnant. Come here.\u201d He beckons to me with his finger.</p> <p>I approach Jake, who\u2019s sitting on the edge of the bed in his boxer shorts. I stand between his legs.</p><p>He places his hands on either side of my swollen tummy and kisses it.</p><p>Tilting his face, he looks up at me. I rest my hands against his cheeks.</p><p>\u201cStay home with me today,\u201d he murmurs.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. Simone and I have had this spa day booked for ages, and she goes back to London in a few days. Anyway, you\u2019re going into the studio today.\u201d</p> <p>He turns his face away. Pressing his cheek against my pregnant belly, he lets out a sigh.</p><p>I run my fingers through his bed hair. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJake...\u201d I urge him to look at me.</p><p>\u201cI dunno,\u201d he says with a shrug. \u201cI just have a weird feeling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of feeling?\u201d I sit beside him on the bed.</p> <p>I don\u2019t like the look in his eyes.</p><p>My heart jumps in my chest, making my pulse thrum.</p><p>Then, lightning-quick, Jake pulls me down on the bed, trapping my legs with his. He pins my arms above my head and kisses me, his whole demeanour instantly changing to relaxed.</p><p>\u201cI just have a feeling you should stay in bed with me.\u201d He runs his tongue lightly over my lower lip. \u201cYou taste minty,\u201d he murmurs.</p><p>\u201cThe power of toothpaste.\u201d I nip his lip with my teeth. I hate when he hides things from me.</p><p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s snarky this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s evading.\u201d</p><p>He looks directly into my eyes. Vivid blues burn into my brown.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not evading.\u201d His voice is controlled, measured, but harsh. \u201cI just wanted to spend the day in bed with you. But maybe, snarky, you should go out before we have a fight neither of us wants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I sigh. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to be. I\u2019m just tired. The baby is so wriggly. I haven\u2019t had a full night\u2019s sleep in so long.\u201d</p><p>Releasing my pinned arms, Jake moves down to my tummy. \u201cLet your mama sleep,\u201d he says. \u201cIf she\u2019s moody and tired, Daddy doesn\u2019t get any.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJake! Don\u2019t say sex things to the baby!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t interrupt, beautiful. This is a father-and-son talk,\u201d he teases.</p><p>He glances up at me through his long black lashes. Just like that, the almost-fight is gone.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so sure we\u2019re having a boy.\u201d I run my fingertips down his cheek.</p><p>We didn\u2019t find out the sex of the baby at the five-month scan. We both agreed we wanted to wait until the birth.</p><p>\u201cSweetheart, the baby keeps you up all night, it\u2019s definitely a boy.\u201d He winks.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re incorrigible!\u201d I giggle.</p><p>\u201cJust how you like me,\u201d he whispers over my skin. Moving up my body, he runs his tongue lightly around the edge of my bra and presses a kiss there.</p><p>The sensation tickles down my body. Then the baby kicks me, hard.</p><p>I wince.</p><p>Seriously, it hurts so much sometimes that I expect bruises. I think I\u2019m carrying a minihulk in there.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Jake asks, concerned.</p><p>\u201cYeah fine, the baby\u2019s just kicking.\u201d I take his hand and place it on the spot where our little ninja is going for it.</p><p>Smoothing his hand over my stomach, he rests his cheek against my breasts and starts to softly sing Guns N\u2019 Roses\u2019 \u201cDon\u2019t Cry.\u201d</p><p>Our baby has a penchant for old rock songs. It\u2019s the only thing that settles him.</p><p>Him. Jake\u2019s even got me saying it.</p><p>I\u2019ve tried playing Jake\u2019s music when he isn\u2019t around, but it doesn\u2019t stop the baby\u2019s marathon kicking sessions. Apparently, the baby will only settle for the live, acoustic renditions of Jake singing old rock songs.</p><p>Which has made for some interesting evenings.</p><p>Jake goes all out, wearing leather pants and playing his old Strat\u2014when Jake does something, he does it to the max. And it always ends in us having seriously hot sex.</p><p>We lie together until Jake finishes the song. With the baby now settled, I get up from the bed and go to get dressed.</p><p>I\u2019m in the dressing area, tying my black maternity wrap dress, when Jake comes in.</p><p>He pulls on his black pyjama pants, then comes up behind me, sliding his arms around my bump. He nuzzles my neck. \u201cYou want some breakfast?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCereal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d He places a kiss on my neck and gives my bum a gentle slap before wandering off.</p><p>I slip my feet into silver ballet pumps, then grab my black C\u00e9line Nano tote that Jake bought me for Christmas and hang it on my shoulder.</p><p>I grab my lip gloss from the bathroom and put it in my bag. I get my phone off the nightstand and head for the kitchen.</p><p>When I get there, I find Jake, Stuart, and Dave around the breakfast bar.</p><p>Ah, my men.</p><p>My heart. My best friend. My bodyguard. Just missing my dad, and I\u2019d have the complete set of important men in my life.</p><p>Stuart\u2019s eating toast, Dave\u2019s sipping on coffee, and Jake\u2019s eating Cocoa Krispies. There\u2019s another bowl with cereal and milk in it, waiting for me.</p><p>Cocoa Krispies, the American equivalent of Coco Pops. To me, they will always be Coco Pops. The only. The best.</p><p>I put my bag down and sit on the stool beside Jake. I lean in, giving him a quick kiss on the lips, but he pulls me in and kisses me harder. Parting my lips with his, he slips his tongue into my mouth.</p><p>He tastes of Coco Pops. So fucking delicious.</p><p>Even with our audience, a heat still spreads between my legs.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Stuart groans. \u201cNo tongues over breakfast.\u201d</p><p>Breaking from Jake, my face flushed, I dig into my Coco Pops.</p><p>\u201cWhen\u2019s Josh back?\u201d I spoon some cereal into my mouth.</p><p>The chocolate hits my tongue and I moan a little sound in my mouth.</p><p>Jake\u2019s hand slides down my thigh, pushing between my legs, parting them. I meet his eyes, then watch as he readjusts himself in his pants. I bite on my lip as he flashes me a sexy grin.</p><p>\u201cThis afternoon,\u201d Stuart says, cutting in on our moment. \u201cHe\u2019s got to go to the hospital first, so I\u2019m not seeing him until tonight.\u201d</p><p>Josh has been away for the last five days at a doctors\u2019 conference. It\u2019s the first time Stuart and him have spent any real time apart, and Stuart has missed him tons. I know because he\u2019s told me so every single day while Josh has been gone.</p><p>\u201cSo this means you\u2019ll finally cheer the fuck up,\u201d Jake imparts.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t been that miserable,\u201d Stuart protests.</p><p>\u201cYou have.\u201d I smile, gathering more cereal onto my spoon.</p><p>\u201cI need you to come into the label with me today,\u201d Jake says to Stuart. \u201cThere\u2019s some work I need you to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, no probs,\u201d Stuart mumbles, biting down on his toast. \u201cIt\u2019ll keep me busy until tonight.\u201d</p><p>I glance at the wall clock and see I have ten minutes left before I\u2019m due to pick up Simone.</p><p>I shovel the remainder of my cereal in my mouth and put my bowl in the dishwasher.</p><p>\u201cYou ready to go?\u201d I ask Dave.</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d He takes one last sip of his coffee and goes over to the sink and washes it out.</p><p>Grabbing my bag, I lean over and give Jake a kiss on the cheek. \u201cI\u2019ll be home at about four thirty, all pampered and smelling pretty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou always smell pretty.\u201d He stares into my eyes for a long moment.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I smile.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d he shakes his head, breaking his stare. \u201cHave a good day.\u201d He kisses me on the lips. \u201cI\u2019ll see you at four thirty. We\u2019re staying in tonight. Takeout and a movie, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds perfect.\u201d I peck him once more on the lips.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he says as I start to move away.</p><p>Turning as I walk, I smile. \u201cLove you more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot possible.\u201d He grins, his eyes lingering on me. But there\u2019s something off in his eyes, and it makes me feel uneasy, just like before in the bedroom.</p><p>His eyes move from me to Dave. \u201cTake good care of my girl.\u201d</p><p>Dave gives him a strange look. \u201cAlways do, Jake.\u201d</p><p>Letting me through the door first, Dave and I head outside to my black BMW X5. Another Christmas present from Jake.</p><p>Except I never get to drive it because Dave drives me everywhere. I\u2019ve driven it twice in five months. But I swear, once the baby is here, I\u2019m driving this car everywhere. Dave can just sit in the backseat like I currently do.</p><p>I climb in my usual place behind the passenger seat and buckle in, setting the seat belt around my bump.</p><p>Dave fires the engine up and starts toward Denny\u2019s house to pick up Simone.</p><p>\u201cCan you put some music on, please?\u201d I ask Dave.</p><p>\u201cAnything in particular?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I shake my head.</p><p>Dave starts searching though the radio stations and hits on one belting out Meatloaf\u2019s \u201cYou Took the Words Right out of My Mouth.\u201d</p><p>Clapping my hands together, I say, \u201cThis! Keep this on!\u201d I start singing along loudly.</p><p>Chuckling, Dave turns it up, but I\u2019m sure he\u2019s just trying to drown me out.</p><p>We reach Denny\u2019s house a few minutes later, and Simone is already waiting out front.</p><p>Dave gets out and opens the door for her.</p><p>Thanking him, she climbs in and pulls off her sunglasses.</p><p>\u201cYou look tired,\u201d she observes.</p><p>\u201cIs that code for, \u2018Tru, you look like shit\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She swats my thigh. \u201cIt\u2019s code for \u2018You look tired.\u2019 Being pregnant is really wearing you out, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d I sigh. \u201cI had such an easy pregnancy in the beginning, but now the baby is getting bigger, and I feel uncomfortable all the time. Plus the baby gets so active at night that I\u2019m hardly getting any sleep, and I just feel cranky all the time.\u201d Unexpected tears prick my eyes.</p><p>I take a deep breath, holding them back.</p><p>\u201cThen this spa day is exactly what you need. Some pampering will make you feel tons better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so,\u201d I utter as Dave heads for the Four Seasons Spa.</p><p>Dave pulls the car up front the Four Seasons. Sitting forward in my seat, I say to him, \u201cYou can leave us here, and I\u2019ll call you when we\u2019re ready to be picked up.\u201d</p><p>He turns in his seat, not looking so hot about this idea. \u201cI should escort you in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDave, it\u2019s a spa that deals with celebrities all the time, and I\u2019m hardly a celebrity\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust carrying the baby of one,\u201d Simone inputs.</p><p>I give her a \u201cnot helping\u201d look.</p><p>With a laugh, Simone opens the car door and hops out.</p><p>\u201cJust go do something fun, and I\u2019ll call you when we need you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll wait out here in the car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here until four.\u201d I screw up my face. \u201cI\u2019m not having you sit out here in the car for six hours waiting for me, because...well, it\u2019s just plain weird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTru, my job is to take care of you. And believe me, sitting outside a spa for six hours is nothing compared to other things I\u2019ve done.\u201d</p><p>A thought flashes through my mind. I wonder if he\u2019s referring to what he\u2019s done for Jake in the past. Or what he\u2019s waited for Jake to do. Things I most definitely do not want to know.</p> <p>\u201cLeaving you alone is more than my job\u2019s worth\u2014so it\u2019s either I wait out here, or I come inside with you and wait in the waiting area or, worse, the treatment room.\u201d</p><p>I frown at him. \u201cFine,\u201d I huff, sliding along the leather seat, \u201csit out here if you must.\u201d Pausing, with my legs dangling out of the car, I ask, \u201cDo you want me to send some food out for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m set.\u201d He indicates a thermos on the passenger seat. \u201cIf you need me at all, you make sure to call me straightaway,\u201d he says just before I shut the door.</p><p>\u201cYes, boss,\u201d I mutter.</p><p>I swear I hear him laughing just as the door closes.</p> <p>I watch him pull the car into a spot facing the entrance. I link arms with Simone, and we walk toward the doors.</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t kidding when you said he literally goes everywhere with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d I sigh.</p><p>\u201cJake\u2019s doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, absolutely,\u201d I mutter as the doorman lets us in.</p><p>I\u2019m in heaven.</p> <p>Spa heaven.</p><p>I\u2019m having a facial, and it may be the best facial I have ever had.</p><p>We\u2019re into the afternoon. So far I\u2019ve had a massage, a pedicure, and lunch. After my facial is done, I\u2019m having a manicure.</p><p>Simone is on the bed beside me, having a facial too.</p><p>\u201cSo the book launch is next week?\u201d Simone asks.</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWish I could be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish you could be too.\u201d</p> <p>I finished up Jake\u2019s biography two months ago, and it\u2019s been with the editor. Then back to me. Then back to the editor.</p><p>This went on for a while, until we both settled on the final draft.</p><p>The excerpts have already started publishing in Etiquette. Vicky said they have seen a 10 percent increase in sales already, which is amazing.</p><p>\u201cIs Vicky coming over for the launch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is.\u201d I smile.</p><p>The launch is in New York as that\u2019s where the publishing house is, so Jake and I are flying over for it. Vicky is meeting us there, and afterward she\u2019s coming back to LA to spend a few days with me.</p><p>I can\u2019t wait.</p><p>I haven\u2019t seen her since I left London. Of course I\u2019ve seen her via Skype, but it\u2019s not the same.</p><p>We have lots of shopping planned for when she\u2019s here.</p><p>\u201cYou really need to get your butt over to London,\u201d Simone says. \u201cIt\u2019s been way too long since you\u2019ve been home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I let out a sigh. \u201cI miss it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd London misses you. Maybe you and Jake could come over for a holiday after the baby is born.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what,\u201d I say, feeling uplifted at the thought. \u201cWe totally should. I could have my hen night in London. Most of my friends I want at my hen are there, and I\u2019m sure Carly and Stuart would come over for it.\u201d</p><p>Jake and I have set the wedding for December. It won\u2019t be the summer wedding we were originally wanting, but neither of us wants to wait until next summer. More than anything I want to be Jake\u2019s wife. December gives me just enough time to lose my baby weight.</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of London,\u201d Simone says, her voice sounding tighter, \u201cI saw Will last week.\u201d</p><p>My heart pauses.</p><p>I turn my face to her and out of the therapist\u2019s hands. \u201cYou did?\u201d My voice wobbles, giving me away.</p><p>I haven\u2019t thought of Will in a long time. I don\u2019t let myself.</p><p>Because if I do, I remember how much I hurt him and how things were left the last time I saw him.</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d She nods, eyeing me carefully.</p><p>I compose my features to neutral. \u201cWhy are you just telling me now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause this is the first chance I\u2019ve had. There\u2019s always someone around.\u201d</p><p>Jake.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s he doing? Did he, um, ask about me?\u201d I might have my face under control, but my mouth is set to give me away.</p><p>\u201cDo you really want me to answer that?\u201d</p><p>I pause.</p><p>Do I?</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He never mentioned you. But then, he wouldn\u2019t have, because, he, um...well, he wasn\u2019t alone when I saw him, Tru.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Pause. \u201cHe\u2019s seeing someone?\u201d Of course he is. Will is a really attractive guy. He\u2019s smart and caring. A real catch.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Is it wrong that I feel a spike of jealousy?</p><p>I look up at the ceiling. Gritting my back teeth, I force a smile. \u201cWell, that\u2019s great news. I\u2019m really pleased for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo you\u2019re not. But I know what you mean. Happy he\u2019s happy. But it still stings, even though you feel you have no right for it to.\u201d</p><p>I love how Simone just gets me. God, I miss not seeing her every day. I\u2019m going to hate it when she\u2019s gone in a few days.</p><p>I turn back to her. \u201cI\u2019d say that just about covers it.\u201d Biting my lip, I ask my next question. \u201cIs she anyone we know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She smiles gently.</p><p>That clarification makes me feel better. If it were someone I knew, I would have felt weird. Okay, weirder.</p><p>\u201cShe seemed real nice, Tru,\u201d Simone adds. \u201cHe looked happy.\u201d</p><p>This is exactly what I wanted for Will. I wanted him to be happy with someone who deserves him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m real glad he\u2019s happy.\u201d I smile. \u201cAnd I actually mean that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you do.\u201d Simone turns her face back to the waiting therapist.</p><p>\u201cWhat does she look like?\u201d I have to ask. Curiosity gets the better of me every time.</p><p>\u201cThe complete opposite of you. Blonde, small-chested, tall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeroxide, flat-chested, and lanky. I take it back. She\u2019s not good enough for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBitch.\u201d Simone flicks her gleaming eyes to me.</p><p>\u201cYou expect any less?\u201d I grin.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She smirks, and we both start laughing.</p><p>Dave is standing by the car as we exit the Four Seasons.</p><p>\u201cYou had a good day?\u201d he asks, opening the car door for us. I let Simone climb in first.</p><p>\u201cWe had a fabulous day.\u201d I beam. \u201cHow was yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, the selection of cakes and fresh coffee that was brought out to me certainly brightened it up. Thank you, Tru. You\u2019re a special kinda lady, you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a special kind of guy, Dave. Not many men would sit in a parking lot and wait six hours for me.\u201d I smile, giving his arm a pat.</p><p>\u201cJake would.\u201d He grins.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but he\u2019s just as crazy as you are!\u201d</p><p>Laughing, he helps me step up into the car and closes the door behind me with a firm clunk.</p><p>I click my seat belt in just as Dave gets in the driver\u2019s side.</p><p>He glances over his shoulder. \u201cDenny\u2019s to drop off Simone, then straight home?\u201d he checks.</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>I kick my shoes off, still feeling all kinds of relaxed from my pampering, and settle back in my seat.</p><p>I tune in to the music Dave is listening to\u2014Pearl Jam.</p><p>\u201cOoh, is this the Backspacer album?\u201d I ask him.</p><p>\u201cHow do you guess the album from just one song?\u201d He gives me a quick look back. \u201cYou\u2019re a little scary, Tru. You do realise that, don\u2019t you?\u201d he chuckles.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a gift.\u201d I nod, grinning. \u201cAnd Dave, a Pearl Jam fan. How did I not know this? Seven months of riding practically every day with you, and you only now reveal your excellent music tastes to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always wait at least seven months before revealing my excellent music tastes to anyone.\u201d He chuckles.</p><p>I loosen my seat belt, leaning forward to talk to him.</p><p>\u201cCan you skip it forward to \u2018Just Breathe\u2019? It\u2019s my favourite of theirs by far. Oh, and crank it up loud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew there was a reason I liked you.\u201d He winks.</p><p>He pulls up at a red light and takes the opportunity to jump the tracks ahead. Hitting \u201cJust Breathe,\u201d he turns the volume up loud. For a moment, I stay still, arms resting on the passenger seat, listening as the beautiful guitar melody fills the car completely.</p><p>The baby gives me a gentle kick. I rub my hand over my tummy.</p><p>A gentle kick, now there\u2019s a first.</p><p>\u201cYou like this song, huh?\u201d I murmur. \u201cI\u2019ll get daddy to sing it to you when we get home.\u201d</p><p>The lights change to green, and Dave shifts the car into drive.</p><p>I sit back, setting the seat belt back around my bump, and start singing along. Simone joins in. I reach over and squeeze her hand. She smiles. Then we hear Dave in the front singing.</p><p>Simone giggles, and I sing through a smile at his baritone voice.</p><p>Life\u2019s good.</p><p>Life is real good.</p><p>I don\u2019t think it gets any better than this, does it?</p><p>Something from the right catches my eye. Still singing, still smiling, I turn my face to the window.</p><p>And that\u2019s when I see it.</p><p>The smile drops from my face.</p><p>They say your life flashes before your eyes in the moment you know you\u2019re about to die.</p><p>Well, I do see my life. But not the one I\u2019ve lived: the one I expected to live.</p><p>Having my baby. Watching him grow. Marrying Jake. Growing old with him. Living with him, loving him. Loving them both until I was old and ready to die.</p><p>That\u2019s what I see in those milliseconds as that car hurtles toward us.</p><p>It\u2019s not my time. Save my baby, please.</p><p>My eyes lock with the driver\u2019s. He looks almost...apologetic. I cover my baby with my arms, and then ________</p><p>JAKE...</p><p>CHAPTER NINETEEN</p><p>I had the worst dream last night.</p><p>Well, I think I did, because I woke up this morning with the worst feeling. Like impending doom. And I haven\u2019t been able to shake it since.</p><p>I\u2019m so fucking ready to wrap this day up and get home to my girl.</p><p>I haven\u2019t spoken to Tru since she left for the spa. I didn\u2019t want to disturb her, but normally I speak to her at least once during the day.</p><p>I need my Tru fix, what can I say?</p><p>I\u2019ll call her now that she should be on her way home to see what she wants for dinner.</p><p>While I switch off the amp, I pull my phone from my back pocket and speed-dial her cell.</p><p>Voice mail.</p><p>Weird. She never turns her phone off.</p><p>Maybe she had to at the spa and forgot to turn it back on.</p><p>I hear Katy Perry start to sing across the studio. Stuart\u2019s fucking ringtone. He really is the epitome of gay at times.</p><p>I unplug my guitar and put it in its stand.</p><p>\u201cHey, gorgeous...what?...Wait, what!...Oh God, no.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s the \u201cno\u201d that makes me stop and turn to him, because he sounds...well, he sounds exactly like he did when we got the call that Jonny had died. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My head prickles, and my blood starts to run cold.</p><p>I feel the air in the room shift instantly.

He turns and locks eyes with me.</p><p>And I know. I just know.</p> <p>Fuck, no.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re coming now.\u201d I watch the phone slide from Stuart\u2019s ear in slow motion.</p><p>\u201cStuart, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Denny comes from around his drum kit.</p><p>Stuart casts a glance to Denny, then comes straight back to me.</p><p>Stop looking at me.</p> <p>\u201cThat was Josh.\u201d His lip trembles. \u201cHe was just about to leave the hospital, when...\u201d His voice breaks, and he clears his throat, then continues. \u201cThree people were brought into the ER. A car accident. It\u2019s Simone, Dave, and...Tru.\u201d</p><p>Tru. Car. Accident.</p><p>No. God, no.</p><p>Denny clasps his hand over his mouth. \u201cSimone, is she...?\u201d Denny sounds afraid.</p><p>I\u2019m afraid. Terrified.</p><p>I can\u2019t breathe. My heart hurts against my ribs. Hurts real bad.</p> <p>Tom and Smith have drawn closer to Stuart.</p><p>He looks at Denny again. \u201cJosh said Simone is roughed up, but she\u2019ll be okay. Dave too, but...\u201d He brings his eyes back to mine. \u201cJake...\u201d He steps toward me.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I step back and bump into the guitar.</p><p>I don\u2019t want to hear this. I don\u2019t want to know.</p><p>I shake my head. I try to move away again, to get away from Stuart, but there\u2019s nowhere left for me to go.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d I watch, numb, as he wipes a tear from his face. \u201cThe other car hit the passenger side. Tru took full impact. Josh said she\u2019s in surgery now. We have to get to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>I close my eyes.</p><p>\u201cThe baby?\u201d The words fall from my mouth. I don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s me talking.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m sorry. We need to go. Josh is waiting in the ER for us. He\u2019ll take us to them.\u201d</p><p>The room is closing in on me. There\u2019s no air.</p><p>I feel like I\u2019m underwater.</p><p>Drowning. I\u2019m drowning.</p><p>I had her this morning, in my arms. I should have kept her there, held her tight, and never let her go.</p><p>I can\u2019t lose her. I can\u2019t.</p><p>Fuck, this hurts. So much. Too much.</p><p>\u201cJake...,\u201d Stuart says.</p><p>I lift my head. \u201cI can\u2019t lose her.\u201d I can\u2019t breathe. I\u2019m gasping for air. \u201cNot her. Anyone but her.\u201d</p><p>My eyes meet his.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Another tear falls from his eye. He wipes it away.</p><p>Tears keep leaving his eyes.</p><p>I want to cry. I want to shout. Something. Anything to get this excruciating pain out of my chest. But nothing\u2019s happening.</p><p>\u201cCome on, let\u2019s get to the hospital. We\u2019ll know more once we\u2019re there.\u201d Stuart urges me to move, and that\u2019s when my legs give out on me.</p><p>He grabs me, wrapping an arm around my back. \u201cI got you,\u201d his voice cracks. \u201cI got you, Jake. It\u2019s gonna be okay. They\u2019ll both be fine.\u201d</p><p>Fine. They\u2019ll both be fine.</p><p>I\u2019m in a car. My car, I think.

I\u2019m supposed to protect her, protect them both.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t there. I should have been there,\u201d I choke out. I know it\u2019s me speaking, but it doesn\u2019t sound like my voice.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s gonna be okay, man.\u201d Tom\u2019s hands come over the backseat, pressing down on my shoulders.</p><p>I feel like he\u2019s holding me in place. Like he thinks I\u2019m going to lose control any moment now.</p><p>I want to lose control. But I can\u2019t seem to get this maddening, sickening feeling out of my chest. It\u2019s trapped in there, burning every part of me.</p><p>\u201cTru\u2019s gonna be fine,\u201d Tom continues. \u201cShe\u2019s a fighter. She\u2019ll get through this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what about the baby...my baby?\u201d I choke on the words.</p><p>Tom\u2019s silence weighs heavy.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re gonna be fine, Jake.\u201d He squeezes my shoulder.</p><p>There it is again. That word\u2014fine.</p><p>But that isn\u2019t what I want to hear. I don\u2019t want to hear any of this. I don\u2019t want to be here. I don\u2019t want to be hearing fine.</p><p>I want to be home with Tru, holding her beautiful body in my arms. I want to feel her skin on mine. Her breath mixing with mine as she kisses me in that gentle way she does.</p><p>I want to hear her laugh. I want to see her smile.</p><p>I want to feel my baby kick.</p><p>I want...them.</p><p>I close my eyes again.</p><p>I\u2019m in the hospital. I can hear Stuart talking. There are people everywhere.</p><p>And white. White walls. White coats.</p><p>Where\u2019s Tru?</p><p>\u201cJake...\u201d</p><p>I turn. It\u2019s Josh. He looks sorry. Sympathetic.</p><p>I don\u2019t want sympathy. I want Tru.</p><p>\u201cJake...,\u201d he repeats. \u201cI\u2019m so very sorry...\u201d I hear the break in his voice.</p><p>Stuart puts his hand on Josh\u2019s arm. I see Josh\u2019s eyes go to it.</p><p>He looks back at me, and then he sounds very businesslike. Like a doctor delivering bad news. \u201cTru\u2019s in surgery. All they\u2019re telling me right now is that she suffered a severe head injury as a result of the accident. Dr. Kimble, one of the surgeons, will be out to see you soon. If you\u2019ll follow me this way...\u201d</p><p>Severe. Head. Injury.</p><p>I\u2019m moving. In an elevator. Upward.</p><p>The doors open with a ping. Then it\u2019s like I wake up. I realise where I am. Why I\u2019m here.</p><p>Tru. Car. Accident.</p><p>Fuck, no.</p><p>No. No. No. No. No. No.</p><p>No!</p><p>I run out of the elevator, sprinting down the hall. I\u2019m not sure where I\u2019m going.</p><p>I just need to find her.</p><p>Surgery. Josh said surgery.</p><p>I can hear voices calling out behind me, but I can\u2019t stop.</p><p>Tru.</p><p>I need to find her.</p><p>Where are you, baby?</p><p>I\u2019m stopping. Why am I stopping?</p><p>Arms around me, stopping me, holding me.</p><p>I don\u2019t want them touching me. I want Tru. I just want Tru.</p><p>\u201cWait, take it easy, Jake. You\u2019re here. We need to go in here.\u201d Stuart, with Tom\u2019s help, steers me through a door into a room.</p><p>A white room.</p><p>Fucking white everywhere.</p><p>Then I\u2019m sitting in a chair.</p><p>I don\u2019t want to be sitting.</p><p>I stand up.</p><p>Everyone stands with me.</p><p>Stuart. Tom. Smith. Josh.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Denny?\u201d Is that me speaking?</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s downstairs in the ER with Simone and Dave,\u201d Stuart answers. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you sit down, Jake?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head.</p><p>I can\u2019t sit while Tru\u2019s...what? While she\u2019s in surgery? While she\u2019s...dying?</p><p>Dying.</p><p>Is she going to die?</p><p>Is my baby dying too?</p><p>Am I going to lose them both? Are they both going to die like Jonny did?</p><p>Why is this happening?</p><p>It hurts. It hurts so fucking much. I feel like my rib cage is being cracked wide open and my life is being drawn out of me, slowly.</p><p>The door opens. A man in a white coat approaches me.</p><p>White.</p><p>Sympathy.</p><p>No.</p><p>I don\u2019t want sympathy. I don\u2019t want to be here. I need to get out of here. I need to find Tru.</p><p>I just want to touch her. Hold her. Never let her go.</p><p>\u201cMr. Wethers, I\u2019m Dr. Kimble.\u201d</p><p>My insides start to shake through to the bone.</p><p>\u201cTru...where is she?\u201d</p><p>The doctor puts his hands together in front of him, in an almost prayerlike manner, pointing them in my direction.</p><p>I don\u2019t like it. I want to knock his fucking hands away.</p><p>\u201cTrudy is still in surgery.\u201d He sounds like Josh did\u2014businesslike. \u201cShe sustained a very severe head injury...\u201d</p><p>There are those words again. But he said \u201cvery.\u201d Josh never said \u201cvery.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s worse. Very is worse.</p><p>God, no.</p><p>\u201c...excessive bleeding within the skull...pressure on her brain...swelling...baby...delivery...\u201d</p><p>Baby.</p><p>I meet the doctor\u2019s eyes. \u201cWhat?\u201d There\u2019s my voice again, but it still doesn\u2019t sound like me.</p><p>Dr. Kimble shifts on his feet. \u201cWe had to make a decision, Mr. Wethers. There was no time to waste. The baby was in severe distress. Its heart rate was dropping exponentially. We had no other choice but to perform an emergency caesarean section.\u201d</p><p>I grip my hand to my chest, digging my fingers into my sternum, trying to relieve the agonising, burning pain inside of me.</p><p>\u201cBut she was only twenty-nine weeks...\u201d I can\u2019t breathe.</p><p>\u201cThe baby\u2019s fine.\u201d He nods, slowly. \u201cHe\u2019s having a little difficulty breathing on his own because of respiratory distress syndrome, which is very common in premature babies, but we\u2019re helping him with that, and he\u2019s responding well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHim?\u201d A tear rolls down my cheek.</p><p>\u201cYes, you have a son.\u201d</p><p>A son.</p><p>We have a son, and Tru doesn\u2019t know. She needs to know. I need to see her, to tell her.</p><p>\u201cWhere is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll be moving him to the NICU shortly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Tru...will she...is she...?\u201d</p><p>He wraps his arms over his chest. \u201cShe\u2019s with some of the best surgeons in the world right now, and they\u2019re doing everything they can for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she\u201d\u2014I take a staggered breath\u2014\u201cIs she going to...make it?\u201d</p><p>I see the look in his eyes, the one he thinks he\u2019s hiding, but I see it clearly.</p><p>\u201cThe doctors are doing everything they can to help her pull through, Mr. Wethers.\u201d</p><p>And this is the exact moment that my worst fear is realised.</p><p>She might die.</p><p>I could lose Tru, with no way back to her.</p><p>Lose her. Forever.</p><p>Oh God, no.</p><p>No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No.</p><p>I press my fist into my forehead. \u201cYou don\u2019t think she\u2019s going to make it.\u201d</p><p>He shifts again, not meeting my eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s too early to make an appropriate diagnosis of\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDON\u2019T FOB ME OFF! JUST TELL ME THE FUCKIN\u2019 TRUTH! IS SHE GOING TO DIE?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJake...\u201d Tom\u2019s hand touches my shoulder, but I shrug him off.</p><p>My chest is heaving, fear driving everything inside me.</p><p>I stare into the doctor\u2019s face, searching.</p><p>I have to know. I have to know if I\u2019m going to lose everything. Lose the only person who has ever mattered to me.</p><p>And right now, he is the only one who can tell me.</p><p>He exhales, his voice softening. \u201cRight now, Trudy\u2019s chances of survival are fifty-fifty at best. When she wakes from the surgery...\u201d He catches himself, and his expression communicates compassion. \u201cIf and when she wakes...\u201d</p><p>If.</p><p>\u201cWe have no idea as to the extent of the damage to her brain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t remember falling. I just know I\u2019m on the floor. Tom\u2019s holding me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And I\u2019m crying.</p><p>There are more people here.

I stare blankly at him. \u201cWe need to call Tru\u2019s mom and dad. They need to know what\u2019s happened. The press will get wind of Tru\u2019s accident soon, if not already, and they can\u2019t find out from the press.\u201d</p><p>My heart stops.</p> <p>Billy and Eva.</p><p>I can\u2019t.</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call them. I\u2019ll get them on the first flight out here.\u201d He touches my arm briefly, then stands. \u201cDo you want me to call your mom too?\u201d</p><p>My mom? Do I want her here?</p><p>I nod, once.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna get a drink.\u201d Smith stands. \u201cJake, do you want me to get you anything?\u201d</p><p>Tru.</p><p>I shake my head.</p><p>\u201cTom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA black coffee.\u201d</p><p>The door bangs shut as Stuart and Smith leave.</p><p>Then it\u2019s just me and Tom.</p><p>And silence. More crippling fucking silence.</p> <p>\u201cWhat if she dies?\u201d</p><p>Tom turns his head and looks me in the eye. \u201cTru\u2019s a fighter, Jake. She kicks my ass daily. She\u2019s going nowhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what if...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t \u2018what if.\u2019 Don\u2019t do that to yourself.\u201d</p><p>My eyes blur. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do. What to think. What to say.\u201d I bury my face in my hands, taking a staggered breath.</p><p>A tear runs through my fingers and drips to the floor.</p><p>I hear Tom take a shallow breath. \u201cDon\u2019t think of the bad, Jake. Think of the good. Think of the moment you get to hold your boy in your arms. Think of the moment you get to put that ring on Tru\u2019s finger when she finally sees stupid and marries your sorry ass. Think of all the amazing fuckin\u2019 things the three of you are going to do together. And while you\u2019re thinking of all that great stuff, I\u2019ll pray to the big man upstairs. I\u2019ll promise to make some serious lifestyle changes in exchange for you to have all that, to have what you were always meant to have.\u201d</p><p>I feel Tom\u2019s hand on my shoulder. He squeezes it.</p><p>I start to cry harder.</p><p>How long has it been? Hours...days...minutes.</p><p>My eyes are sore. My head hurts.</p><p>I hear the door go again. It\u2019s Josh.</p><p>He comes and sits by me.</p><p>\u201cI was just talking to Dr. Fuller. She\u2019s the neonatologist caring for your son. She said he\u2019s doing good, Jake, real good. You can go up and see him when you\u2019re ready.\u201d</p><p>I turn and look at him blankly.</p><p>Go and see him. Without Tru.</p><p>But...</p><p>I shouldn\u2019t see him without Tru.</p><p>And I can\u2019t leave here. I need to know what\u2019s happening with Tru.</p><p>I can\u2019t. I just...can\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take you up to see him, and I\u2019ll wait outside. The instant I get any news about Tru, I\u2019ll come in and get you, I promise,\u201d Josh says as if reading my mind.</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d I shake my head. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can.\u201d</p><p>Josh draws his knees up and rests his arms on them, linking his hands together. There\u2019s a long pause before he speaks again. But when he does, I hear the intention clear in his voice. \u201cI know you feel like leaving this room is like leaving Tru, but there\u2019s nothing you can do for her right now, Jake, no matter where you are. But your son...he needs you. He needs one of his parents.\u201d</p><p>One of his parents.</p><p>I close my eyes.</p><p>He\u2019s alone up there. He must be so confused and scared. He needs me.</p><p>\u201cOkay...,\u201d I agree, opening my eyes. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour son is right in there.\u201d Josh points to the closed door across from us. \u201cThere\u2019s a nurse with him, and I\u2019ll be waiting right out here for you.\u201d He indicates a row of three plastic chairs.</p><p>Turning to the door, I stare at it for a long moment.</p><p>I take a deep breath as I push my hand through my hair, then I walk toward the door.</p><p>My body is trembling, and the closer I get, the harder I start to shake.</p><p>He\u2019s in there. Right behind that door.</p><p>I reach for the handle. Curling my fingers around the metal, I push down and slowly open the door.</p><p>The room is low-lit. There\u2019s no sound except for the beeping of a machine.</p><p>The nurse has her back to me, but she turns and smiles at my arrival.</p><p>\u201cMr. Wethers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d My voice is hoarse.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s right over there. He\u2019s been waiting for you.\u201d She smiles warmly.</p><p>Turning to my right, I see an incubator. Inside the incubator is my son.</p><p>My son.</p><p>I can\u2019t see him clearly through all the tubes surrounding him, but he looks small. So very small. Fragile. Breakable.</p><p>My heart starts to beat hard in my chest.</p><p>I want to go to him, but I find myself taking a step back.</p><p>I don\u2019t think I can help him. I shouldn\u2019t be here. Coming up here was a mistake.</p><p>I\u2019m just about to turn and leave when the nurse comes up beside me. \u201cDon\u2019t let all the tubes scare you, honey. They\u2019re just there to help him breathe until he\u2019s strong enough to do it himself. Why don\u2019t you go say hello?\u201d she urges gently.</p><p>I stare blankly down at her.</p><p>My mouth is dry. My pulse is thumping so hard that blood is roaring in my ears.</p><p>Tru should be here. She should be seeing him with me. It shouldn\u2019t be this way.</p><p>This is wrong.</p><p>I swallow back the tears burning my throat.</p><p>Somehow I manage a step forward. Then another. Until I reach the incubator.</p><p>I stare down at him through the clear unit.</p><p>He looks just like Tru. Exactly like her. Perfect in every way possible.</p><p>And it hurts in every way imaginable.</p><p>He\u2019s even smaller close up. There\u2019s a tube taped to his little nose and a little white knitted hat on his head.</p><p>\u201cHow much does he weigh?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cTwo pounds, seven ounces.\u201d</p><p>My heart sinks. Two pounds, seven ounces. Jesus, he weighs about the same as a bag of sugar.</p><p>My hand reaches out to him before I even realise I\u2019m doing it. I stop myself, clenching my hand into a fist.</p><p>\u201cYou can touch him,\u201d the nurse says. \u201cJust clean your hands with this first.\u201d</p><p>Coming over, she squeezes some sanitizer into my hand. I rub the cold gel over my hands until it\u2019s gone.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you a moment alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he going to be okay?\u201d My words come out ragged.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got a fighter there, honey. He\u2019s gonna be just fine.\u201d She touches my arm briefly, and then she\u2019s gone. And I\u2019m left alone with him.</p><p>My son.</p><p>I get down to my knees, putting me at face level with him. His little face is turned toward me.</p><p>He\u2019s got Tru\u2019s full lips.</p><p>I reach my trembling hand through the porthole, and resting my palm flat on the mattress, I reach my little finger out to his tiny hand, and I touch him.</p><p>In this moment, I\u2019ve never felt anything like it.</p><p>Love.</p><p>It\u2019s different from the love I feel for Tru. But equally as strong. It\u2019s an all-consuming need to protect him forever. To keep him safe from any pain. Like the pain I\u2019m feeling right now.</p><p>It chokes me to tears.</p><p>I stroke my finger gently along his hand, and as I do, his fingers curl around it, holding on to me.</p><p>He needs me.</p><p>Salty tears trickle down my cheeks and into my mouth.</p><p>Pressing my lips together, I rest my forehead against the incubator.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry I wasn\u2019t there...\u201d I whisper. \u201cSo very sorry.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY</p><p>Jake.\u201d</p><p>Hearing Josh\u2019s voice behind me, I pull my head back from the incubator, away from my son. I blink up at Josh.</p><p>Tru.</p><p>I gently slip my finger from my son\u2019s hand and stand up. My legs are stiff and aching. And my heart is painful in my chest.</p><p>\u201cTru\u2019s out of surgery. They\u2019re transferring her to a private room. You can go down and see her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she...?\u201d My heart pauses. I swallow past the fear. \u201cIs she okay?\u201d</p><p>Josh runs his hand over his face. \u201cAll I\u2019ve been told is they got the bleeding under control and managed to relieve the pressure off her brain, but there is still significant swelling. The resident neurosurgeon, Dr. Kish, who led on Tru\u2019s surgery, is waiting downstairs to talk to you before you go in to see her.\u201d</p><p>To prepare me.</p><p>Fear slithers down my spine.</p><p>I see Josh\u2019s eyes move to the incubator. He takes a step closer. \u201cHe\u2019s beautiful, Jake. Really beautiful.\u201d</p><p>Just like his mom.</p><p>I nod. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShall we go?\u201d Josh gestures to the door.</p><p>I take a hesitant step forward.</p><p>There are so many emotions going through me right now. Mostly fear, but I\u2019m also torn.</p><p>I need to see Tru with a desperate, painful ache, but I feel like I can\u2019t leave my son alone either.</p><p>Seeming to sense my distress, Josh says, \u201cStuart\u2019s waiting right outside. He wants to talk to you before you see Tru. Do you want him to sit with the baby while you see her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I exhale, briefly closing my eyes. If I was going to entrust my son to anyone, it would be Stuart.</p><p>Turning, I reach my hand through the porthole again and touch his tiny arm lightly. \u201cI\u2019ll be back soon.\u201d</p><p>I give him one last parting look, then follow Josh out of the room.</p><p>I pull the door closed behind me and find Stuart leant against the wall. His eyes are red and puffy.</p><p>Pushing from the wall, he comes over. \u201cHow is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s...good.\u201d I push my hands in my front jean pockets.</p><p>Perfect. Beautiful. Everything his mom is.</p><p>\u201cHow does he look?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike Tru.\u201d Raw, acute pain tears through me. I stare past Stuart, at the wall. Tears push at my eyes. I close them. I never thought there would be a day that it would be painful for me to speak her name. \u201cHe looks exactly like his mom\u2014beautiful.\u201d</p><p>I hear his choked breath.</p><p>As I open my eyes, I catch him swiping a tear.</p><p>\u201cTru\u2019s mom and dad are on the way to the airport now. I took care of all the arrangements. I chartered them on a private jet. They\u2019ll be here first thing in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d I push my hand through my hair. \u201cHow did they take it?\u201d</p><p>Stuart shakes his head.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t need to say anything. I know exactly how they took it. I felt it the moment Stuart told me.</p><p>Devastation. Complete and utter devastation.</p><p>\u201cI spoke to your mom. I got her and Dale a private flight in too. They\u2019re coming straight to the hospital as soon as they land.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Thank you for calling them.\u201d I swallow past the burning in my throat. \u201cHow are you doing?\u201d I ask him. \u201cI know how much Tru means to you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m...\u201d He lifts his shoulders lightly, biting his lip. \u201cYou guys are my family.\u201d He swipes away another tear. \u201cI\u2019m here for whatever you need.\u201d</p><p>Sensing rising emotions, something he seems good at, Josh steps in, putting a hand on Stuart\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m going to take Jake to see Tru now. I said you\u2019d stay with the little guy.\u201d He tilts his head toward the door behind me.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want him to be alone,\u201d I add, my voice raw again.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Stuart nods. \u201cThere\u2019s nowhere else I\u2019d want to be right now.\u201d</p> <p>Leaving Stuart, Josh takes the lead and I follow him.</p><p>Stopping, I turn back. \u201cStuart?\u201d</p><p>He stops with the door partway open. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>I step forward. \u201cHold his hand.

Got it.\u201d He nods. \u201cI\u2019ll take good care of him, Jake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you will.\u201d</p><p>I follow Josh down the hall toward the bank of elevators. My heart labours heavy in my chest. Fear roils around me at the thought of seeing Tru.</p><p>All I\u2019ve wanted for the last few hours is to see her, and now I\u2019m so close. I\u2019m so very fucking terrified.</p><p>We step inside the elevator. Josh presses the button to take us down a few floors.</p> <p>The doors slide closed.</p><p>\u201cJake, I want you to be prepared for seeing Tru. She\u2019s not going to be\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say it. I know. But...just don\u2019t say it.\u201d I cross my arms, pushing at the ache in my chest.</p><p>Josh nods and stares straight ahead.</p><p>The elevator glides to a halt, the doors slide open, and I follow Josh out.</p><p>With every step closer to Tru, the more panic and terror I feel at what I\u2019m going to see.</p><p>We take a right at the end of the hall, into another empty hall, except for a man sitting, writing on some papers attached to a clipboard.</p><p>Putting the clipboard down, he stands at our approach and pushes his glasses up his nose.</p> <p>He\u2019s a bookish-looking doctor wearing blue cotton pants and a V-neck top. At least he\u2019s not wearing a white coat.</p><p>He\u2019s wearing scrubs.</p><p>Are they what he wore while operating on Tru?</p><p>I start to feel sick as unwanted images flash through my mind.</p><p>\u201cJosh.\u201d He nods.</p><p>\u201cLucas, this is Jake Wethers, Trudy\u2019s fianc\u00e9. Jake, this is Dr. Lucas Kish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you, Jake.\u201d</p><p>I nod a response.</p><p>It\u2019s not exactly like I want to shake his fucking hand and say It\u2019s nice to meet you, because it\u2019s really fucking not.</p><p>I don\u2019t want to meet him. I don\u2019t want Tru to be here.</p><p>\u201cOkay, so...\u201d He pushes his hands into his trouser pockets. \u201cAs Dr. Kimble explained to you before, Trudy suffered a severe head injury as a result of the impact.\u201d</p><p>I wince at the pain the words bring me.</p><p>\u201cFrom the impact, she hit her right frontal lobe, what we call the emotional part of the brain, causing a severe contusion to the skull. There was internal bleeding and swelling to the brain. We stemmed the bleeding and eased the pressure there. Trudy also suffered other injuries from the accident. Her collarbone was fractured, her right arm broken, and her hand crushed...\u201d</p><p>Fractured. Broken. Crushed.</p><p>\u201c...but it\u2019s the head injury that obviously causes the most concern.\u201d</p><p>I try to steer my emotions deep inside so I can focus on what he\u2019s telling me. But my eyes keep flicking to the door to my left, where I know Tru is.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, I force out the words I fear the answer to most. \u201cIs she going to get through this?\u201d</p><p>Dr. Kish removes his hands from his pockets, folds them together, and takes a deep breath. I see his eyes sweep the floor before coming back to me.</p><p>Nerves crawl around my body.</p><p>\u201cThe next twenty-four hours are critical. Her vitals are stable but low. She\u2019s in a coma and attached to a ventilator. She isn\u2019t breathing on her own. With your consent, I plan on removing the ventilator in the next twenty-four to forty-eight hours to see if Trudy responds to breathing alone. If she does, we\u2019re looking on the side of positive.\u201d</p><p>I swallow hard. \u201cAnd...if she doesn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>He looks me firmly in the eye. \u201cWe cross that bridge when we come to it. These next few days are critical for Trudy\u2019s recovery, but I promise you that we are going to do everything in our power to see her through to the other side of this and get her back home with you and your son.\u201d</p><p>I push at the ache in my chest with my hand. \u201cWhen she does wake, could there be long-term damage to her brain?\u201d My mouth feels papery.</p><p>He removes his glasses and rubs his eyes. \u201cPossibly, yes. We won\u2019t know that until she wakes. The good thing is, the left side of her brain is fine. If it had been the left, her speech, amongst other things, could have been affected. So we have that to be thankful for.\u201d</p><p>I tense, fist clenching at my side. \u201cI don\u2019t see anything to be thankful for right now.\u201d My tone is cold, biting.</p><p>I see the concern flash over his face. \u201cOf course not, I didn\u2019t mean...I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJake.\u201d Josh\u2019s hand goes to my arm, but I can\u2019t relax. \u201cLucas didn\u2019t mean anything by it. He\u2019s just trying to give you the positive side of the bad. He is one of the best neurosurgeons the US has to offer. You can trust him. He will do everything possible to get Tru through this.\u201d</p><p>My eyes go to Josh, then Dr. Kish. I swallow past the brick in my throat. \u201cYou have to get her through this because...she\u2019s everything.\u201d</p><p>He looks at me with understanding, and he nods his head once. \u201cYou have my word, Jake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I just...\u201d I rub my hand over my face. \u201cCan I...? I just want to see her.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Kish steps closer. \u201cYou can, but I need you to be prepared. Trudy will look very different right now. There\u2019s severe bruising to her face, and her eyes are slightly open, giving the impression that she\u2019s awake. It\u2019s due to the swelling on the brain, which forces the eyes open\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I cut him off, not needing to hear any more. \u201cI just need to see her.\u201d</p><p>Leaving them both where they stand, I head straight to the door.</p><p>Then I pause.</p><p>Turning, I realise I haven\u2019t asked before now. \u201cHow did the accident happen?\u201d</p><p>Josh glances at Kish, then back to me. \u201cA drunk driver. He ran a red light and went into the side of them.\u201d</p><p>Rage I never knew I possessed strikes me, driving into my head like nails. I grit my teeth together, fists clenched at my sides. \u201cDid he survive? The driver?\u201d</p><p>Josh shakes his head slowly. \u201cNo. He died on impact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Because I would have killed the motherfucker with my bare hands if he had.</p><p>Turning back to the door, back to Tru, I pull in a deep breath, then push down on the handle and walk slowly into the room.</p><p>Tru.</p><p>Jesus, no.</p><p>Pain digs its ruthless claws deep into my chest.</p><p>Nothing could have ever prepared me for this.</p><p>She looks broken. Barely resembling the Tru I know.</p><p>Everything suddenly seems slow, like I\u2019m moving against water as I take her in.</p><p>Her skin is pale. There\u2019s a white soft bandage over the right side of her head, and I can see that her beautiful hair has been shaved off in front.</p><p>Her right arm up to her shoulder is in a cast. Her hand is swaddled in bandages. Her face is swollen and bruised. Her eyes are slightly open, like Kish said they would be. She looks awake, but I know she\u2019s not.</p><p>More than anything, I wish she were. I would give everything to have her awake right now.</p><p>My skin prickles and my senses go into overload as I take in all the tubes emerging from her body.</p><p>The machines keeping her alive beep, echoing inside my mind.</p><p>Jesus, no, baby.</p><p>Memories of her flash through my mind...</p><p>Seeing her again in that hotel room after all those years...Tru lying beneath me as I moved inside her the first time we made love...confessing my love for her...dancing with her at the Eiffel Tower...her agreeing to marry me...us together on that island...her face when she saw our new home...Tru telling me she was pregnant...the first moment we saw our baby on the monitor...</p><p>Crossing the room in strides, I fall to my knees at her bedside, hitting the cold, hard tile floor. The bite of pain is barely noticeable to me.</p><p>I take hold of her hand, pressing my face against it. I inhale her scent, needing to be close to her. Needing her. But it only makes this hurt so much more.</p><p>Tears track painful lines down my cheeks.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t leave me, Tru.\u201d I choke on the pain in my throat as tears drip from my chin onto the bed. \u201cI need you so fuckin\u2019 much. We need you. We\u2019ve got a son, Tru, and he\u2019s so perfect, so beautiful. He looks just like you. I love you so fuckin\u2019 much. Don\u2019t leave me, baby, please...\u201d I close my eyes. \u201cPlease come back to me.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE</p><p>I pace the foyer of the small wing where Tru and my son now are. Security flanks the door behind me.</p><p>As I knew would happen, the press are camped outside.</p><p>They won\u2019t even give me space to figure my way through this. It\u2019s all over the news\u2014the accident, Tru\u2019s condition, and how my son was brought into this world.</p><p>A few hours ago, a reporter managed to sneak his way into the hospital. His aim was to get a picture of Tru in her hospital bed.</p><p>What kind of sick fuck does that?</p><p>If he had gotten anywhere near her, I would have killed him where he stood.</p><p>It turns out the guy never even made it down the hall.</p><p>Dave set up residency outside Tru\u2019s room the second he was released. With his broken arm, he dragged the reporter out of there. Or so I\u2019ve been told. I didn\u2019t see it myself. I was with my son at the time. I hate that I wasn\u2019t there.</p><p>For Tru and my son\u2019s safety, I had them moved to a private wing. Their rooms are next to one another\u2019s, with Dave situated outside Tru\u2019s door and a guard outside my son\u2019s. Security is covering both entrances and exits.</p><p>I haven\u2019t spoken to Dave about the accident or the incident with the reporter. I haven\u2019t spoken to him at all.</p><p>In a brief conversation with Denny earlier, he told me Dave is blaming himself for the accident.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t his fault.</p><p>Have I told him that?</p><p>No.</p><p>Why?</p><p>I\u2019m not entirely sure.</p><p>And why am I here pacing the floor outside the elevators and not with Tru right now?</p><p>Because Billy and Eva are on their way up.</p><p>And I am so very fucking terrified to see them.</p><p>I haven\u2019t spoken to them yet. Ben picked them up from the airport and drove them straight here.</p><p>I haven\u2019t spoken to them because I don\u2019t know what to say.</p><p>Do I say I\u2019m sorry?</p><p>Because I am. So very fucking sorry. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t get Tru to stay home with me that morning. Sorry I didn\u2019t protect her like I promised I would. Sorry I brought her to LA.</p><p>If I had never talked Tru into moving to LA, this never would have happened.</p><p>We should have moved to the UK. If we had, she wouldn\u2019t be in that hospital bed fighting for her life.</p><p>Fighting. For. Her. Life.</p> <p>I want to fight. I want to fight this fucking pain out of me.</p><p>I want to beat the shit out of the motherfucker who got drunk, and then climbed into his car and ran that red light, changing our lives irrevocably. I hate that he\u2019s dead, because I want to kill him myself. I want to kill that bastard over and over again for what he\u2019s done to my girl.</p><p>I feel like I haven\u2019t breathed since I saw her. All those tubes were coming out of her body, with the sound of the ventilator\u2019s pumping giving me the only sign she\u2019s still alive.</p><p>I miss her so fucking much.</p><p>I miss her voice. Her smile. Her beautiful brown eyes gazing at me in that special way.</p> <p>If she dies...if I lose her...I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to go on.</p><p>How do you live when your life dies?</p><p>The light in the elevator bank signals an imminent stop.</p><p>My mouth dries and my hands start to shake. I flex my fingers in and out.</p><p>The door slides open. I see Eva first.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t realized until this moment just how much Tru looks like her mom.</p> <p>Seeing Eva, her eyes wide with fear and heartbreak, looking like Tru, twists a knife in my heart.</p><p>Her eyes meet mine and I see them fill with tears. \u201cOh, Jake.\u201d Her voice breaks. She rushes toward me, throwing her arms around me, and cries into my T-shirt.</p><p>I try to hold it together, but then Billy is there. He puts one arm around Eva, the other around me, and I break down.</p><p>After a moment, I wipe my face dry on my sleeve. Needing to regain some space and composure, I take a step back from them both. \u201cShall I take you to Tru?\u201d I ask, my voice hoarse.</p><p>Dabbing her eyes dry with a tissue, Eva replies, \u201cYes,\u201d at the same time as Billy.</p><p>As we walk to Tru\u2019s room, I\u2019m relieved for the space to piece myself back together.</p><p>Listening to Billy and Eva cry for Tru was like feeling their heartbreak coupled in with my own.</p><p>I know heartbreak. I felt it when Tru left me when I fucked up with the drugs.</p> <p>But this\u2014it\u2019s like my heart is slowly dying, gasping for the fuel it needs to go on. Tru. I know, unequivocally, if I lose her, everything that is me will go with her.</p><p>As we approach Tru\u2019s room, Dave stands.</p><p>He\u2019s the only one here at the moment. I sent everyone to the hotel across the street.</p><p>I needed them all out of here.</p><p>I told them Billy and Eva would need space with Tru. But honestly, I just couldn\u2019t cope with Simone\u2019s constant crying. Stuart\u2019s worrying eyes on me. Even Tom was driving me insane. He kept looking at me like he was expecting me to fall over the edge. I know what he was thinking.</p><p>What they\u2019re all thinking.</p><p>Worrying I\u2019ll do what I always do when things get hard\u2014run straight to the ready hands of a dealer.</p><p>I\u2019m not doing that this time.</p><p>Things are bad enough without me being the coward I know I am and erasing the pain with coke.</p><p>I knew it was only going to get so much harder when Billy and Eva arrived.</p><p>I just didn\u2019t realize how much harder.</p><p>\u201cMr. and Mrs. Bennett, I\u2019m so very sorry about Tru.\u201d I notice that Dave can\u2019t meet their eyes.</p><p>I watch Eva\u2019s eyes rake over Dave\u2019s injuries, then come back to his face. \u201cDave, you were with Tru...in the accident?\u201d</p><p>He nods solemnly, his eyes going to the floor. \u201cYes. I was driving the car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas she...awake after the accident?\u201d</p><p>Fear clings to my skin. I hadn\u2019t asked this question, because I was afraid of the answer. I can\u2019t bear to think of Tru in pain. The thought alone tears me to pieces.</p><p>Dave looks up, first at me, then Eva. \u201cNo.\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cShe didn\u2019t wake up.\u201d</p><p>I hear a rush of breath come from Billy, mirroring my own. As I glance at him, I see how very bad he looks.</p><p>Unshaven, crumpled, quiet. Not the Billy I know.</p><p>She\u2019s his little girl. This is killing him.</p><p>We need to get this over with. They need to see Tru.</p><p>I take the lead, heading for the door, and they both follow.</p><p>From the instant they see her, their reaction is no different than mine was.</p><p>It hurts so fucking much to hear their pain. Watch them sob over her bedside.</p><p>It\u2019s crippling.</p><p>I feel like I\u2019m drowning again. Fighting against the tide with no way of surfacing. Suffocating under the pressure of the emotions in the room. I know I have to get out of here.</p><p>Slipping out of the room quietly, I leave them alone.</p><p>Fogged up, my head aching, I take the seat beside Dave.</p><p>We sit in mutual silence for a long moment.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t blame you,\u201d I finally say. I take a deep breath, then turn and look at him. \u201cI know you will have done everything you could to protect her. I know what kind of man you are.\u201d</p><p>Dave turns, briefly meeting my eyes. He gives a slow nod, then quickly looks away. I don\u2019t miss the tears misting up his eyes.</p><p>The door to Tru\u2019s room opens soon after, and Billy and Eva emerge.</p><p>\u201cCan we see him?\u201d Billy asks.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d I get up and lead the way to my son\u2019s\u2014their grandson\u2019s\u2014room.</p><p>I push the door open. The nurse is sitting in a chair by his incubator, reading.</p><p>Closing her book, she stands at our entrance. \u201cI\u2019ll give y\u2019all a moment,\u201d she says, exiting the room.</p><p>The room is so silent. The only sound is the blipping of the machine.</p><p>I walk over and stare down at my sleeping boy. I get a heavy combination of love and heartbreak every time I look at him.</p><p>Turning back, I see Billy and Eva still standing near the door.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s sleeping,\u201d I say quietly.</p><p>Billy is first to move. He walks over to the incubator and stands beside me.</p><p>I hear his breath catch. Lifting his gaze back to Eva, he says to her, \u201cHe looks just like Tru.\u201d</p><p>I bite my quivering lip, hard, to stop the flow of emotion I feel coming, and I get a sharp taste of blood in my mouth.</p><p>Eva comes over, so I stand back to give them space.</p><p>I know why they were hesitant to see him once they were in here. They fear he might be all they\u2019ll have left of Tru.</p><p>I know this because it\u2019s what I\u2019m so very fucking terrified of myself.</p><p>Resting her hand lightly on the top of the incubator, Eva turns to me. \u201cDo you have a name for him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I shake my head. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t agree on one.\u201d</p><p>Tru and I had so many disagreements over baby names. But now it all just seems so irrelevant. I would give anything for her to be here with me, naming our son.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to name him until Tru wakes up.\u201d I clear my throat. \u201cI want her to choose his name.\u201d</p><p>Eva nods. \u201cI think she\u2019ll like that, Jake.\u201d She looks back down at my boy. \u201cFor now, my little darling,\u201d she says, smiling, \u201cuntil your mummy wakes up, you\u2019re Baby Wethers-Bennett.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO</p><p>Okay, so in the world of music\u201d\u2014I start flicking through the music magazine that Dave brought me\u2014\u201cthere is absolutely nothing worth telling.\u201d</p><p>Closing the magazine, I toss it to the floor beside my chair, and it hits with a loud slap.</p><p>Leaning back, I stretch out my aching legs and push my fingers into my hair. \u201cWhat else is happening? Right, so Vicky\u2019s going home today. She\u2019s stayed as long as she could, sweetheart, but she has to get back to the magazine, keep it running so you\u2019ve got a job to go back to. Not that you need to work, but I know how much you love your job. Oh, and don\u2019t worry about the book launch. The publishers said it can happen whenever we want, so there\u2019s no worry on that score...\u201d Taking a deep breath, I trail off and stare at Tru.</p><p>Her eyes are closed like they have been for the past four days.</p><p>As the swelling on her brain started to reduce, her eyes closed naturally, and now it just looks like she\u2019s sleeping. My beautiful sleeping girl.</p><p>The good news is she\u2019s breathing alone. Kish monitored her breathing and how much was assisted and unassisted for the first few days. Her unassisted breathing increased hourly, and when she reached 90 percent unassisted, Kish removed her ventilator.</p><p>He assured me this was very positive for her recovery.</p><p>I want to get my hopes up. But I\u2019m afraid to.</p><p>So for those four days, like the three before them, I have sat here waiting for her to open her eyes and tell me to stop boring the fuck out of her with the shit I spout.</p><p>Because that\u2019s all I do, sit here and talk to Tru, waiting for her to wake.</p><p>Aside from the regular visits to my son, I never leave her. My son, who is still waiting for his mom to wake up and name him.</p><p>Leaning forward, I reach over and take hold of her soft, warm hand. Her unresponsive hand.</p><p>\u201cOur boy is still waiting for his name, Tru, so you need to hurry and open those beautiful eyes of yours so you can choose it. It can even be one of those god-awful ones you were suggesting when we were trying to decide on names\u2014you remember, sweetheart? What was that one you suggested? Skip? Fuckin\u2019 Skip Wethers!\u201d Shaking my head, I let out a laugh.</p><p>It echoes around the room and hits me back painfully in the chest.</p><p>Closing my eyes, I let my head hang back and I release a long sigh to the ceiling.</p><p>The ceiling that I close my eyes to every night.</p><p>I haven\u2019t stepped foot out of this hospital since the day of the accident.</p><p>When I do manage to sleep, it\u2019s beside Tru on a bed I had brought in for me. The times I do eat, it\u2019s in here with her.</p><p>I fear wandering too far from this room in case she wakes. I have to be here when she opens her eyes. I have to be the first thing she sees.</p><p>I need her to know that I\u2019m here for her, that I will always be here for her.</p><p>So here I wait. In a hospital, surrounded by medication.</p><p>Drugs.</p><p>Do I want a hit?</p><p>Yes. So very fucking badly.</p><p>I want the fear and pain that\u2019s consuming me to disappear.</p><p>I fucking hate that I want drugs.</p><p>I hate that while my girl is lying in that bed, trying to fight her way back, I\u2019m sitting here thinking about getting high.</p><p>I\u2019m a shitty excuse for a human being.</p><p>How can I think of drugs at a time like this?</p><p>Because I\u2019m a motherfucking bastard.</p><p>And I hate that.</p><p>But for me, it\u2019s life. The addict will always live inside of me.</p><p>The only resolve I have is that Tru doesn\u2019t know just how much the addict still lives in me. And she\u2019ll never know.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t bear it if she did.</p><p>Currently I\u2019m still clean, and I want to keep it that way...but I can feel my resolve slipping.</p><p>Only two things are stopping me from taking a hit.</p><p>One\u2014my son.</p><p>And it\u2019s not because I\u2019m father of the fucking year. I wish I were.</p><p>No, it\u2019s because I\u2019m all he has right now. I know better than anyone what it feels like to be let down by your deadbeat drug addict of a father. I won\u2019t be him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And two\u2014Tru.</p><p>I made a promise to her, and I will do everything in my power to keep that promise. I never want her to look at me again the way she did when she found me that morning with that girl in my bed.</p><p>So that\u2019s what\u2019s stopping me from becoming the lowest scum of the earth. How long that will last, I don\u2019t know.</p><p>Leaving my seat, I walk over to the window.</p> <p>The city moves below like nothing is amiss. But everything is amiss.</p><p>My world has stopped turning.</p><p>It feels unjust that people\u2019s lives are still moving forward while mine is trapped at a standstill.</p><p>I lift my eyes to the setting sun.</p><p>Another day will soon be over. Another day without Tru.</p> <p>Another day without the sound of her voice, her smile. God, I miss her beautiful smile. Her laughter.</p><p>Most of all, I miss her touch.</p><p>The feel of her in my arms, her warm skin against mine.</p><p>I close my eyes tight and let my forehead rest against the glass. \u201cSeven days, baby...\u201d I sigh. \u201cSeven fuckin\u2019 days without you. I just...\u201d I bang my forehead against the window. \u201cI need you to come back to me now, Tru. I can\u2019t do this without you. I need you so very much. God, baby, I\u2019m losing it without you.\u201d Tilting my head to the side, I open my eyes and look at her still form. The empty shell of my girl.</p><p>I feel an intense rush of frustration and uncontrollable anger surge into me.</p><p>\u201cAre you angry with me because I wasn\u2019t there when the accident happened? Is that why you\u2019re not coming back? Are you punishing me, Tru?\u201d Leaning back from the window, my muscles tighten as I turn to her. \u201cGoddamnit, Tru, don\u2019t punish me, please. I can\u2019t bear this silence. Not having you here with me...it\u2019s killing me.\u201d</p> <p>I let my head drop. Tears burn my eyes.</p><p>I rub my face roughly.</p><p>Then frustration flares through my veins again.</p><p>I snap my head up. \u201cGoddamnit, Tru!\u201d I know my voice is loud, but right now, I don\u2019t give a fuck. \u201cOpen your eyes and kick my sorry ass for failing you! God knows I deserve it. This isn\u2019t you, Tru. You don\u2019t give up on anything!\u201d</p><p>Moving in strides, I\u2019m at her bedside in a second, I place my hands on the bed.</p><p>Looming over her body, I search her face. I can feel all my want and anger and frustration pulsing under my skin.</p><p>\u201cGoddamnit, Tru! Wake up!\u201d I stare hard at her face, willing her eyes to open, as though my pain and longing alone will do it.</p><p>My fingers curl into the sheets.</p> <p>\u201cWe fuckin\u2019 need you! I need you!\u201d</p><p>The pain hits again. Sharp and sudden.</p><p>Exhaling in a rush, I move away from her, walking across the room.</p><p>Part of me wants to turn and walk out the door, out of the hospital, and to the nearest dealer I can find.</p><p>No.</p><p>I won\u2019t fall. Not now. I can\u2019t.</p><p>I just need to find a way to bring her back.</p><p>Forcing focus, I start pacing.</p><p>She can hear me. I know she can. She\u2019s still in there. I just need to figure out what will bring her back.</p><p>Stopping, I turn to her again. \u201cI know you can hear me, Tru. I know you\u2019re listening.\u201d</p><p>Then it hits me.</p><p>I pull my cell from my pocket, go to my music listings, and start searching.</p><p>I\u2019ve been playing music to her every day. Songs I know she loves, songs we grew up listening to, songs I wrote...the song I wrote for her.</p><p>I even sing to her. But none of those songs have touched her, so now I\u2019m last-resorting it.</p><p>Now I\u2019m going to play the one song she wanted me to leave behind. I need her to hear me, and this is the last card I\u2019ve got to play.</p><p>I need her to know how desperate I am.</p><p>That I\u2019m more desperate than I was that night I sang it to her at Madison Square Garden. At least I knew she was here in the world, vibrant and living.</p><p>Now she\u2019s...nothing.</p><p>I select the live version of Nine Inch Nails\u2019 \u201cHurt,\u201d hoping upon all hope that it will evoke the emotion I need her to feel. I press Play and set it on repeat. I then close my eyes under a silent prayer as the song starts, filling every part of the room.</p><p>I open up my eyes and carefully climb up on the bed beside her, put the phone between us, while Trent Reznor sings, reminding me of a troubled time, one I would right now give anything to go back to.</p><p>I lie beside her, my hand holding hers, as I will my girl to come back to me.</p><p>\u201cJake?\u201d I feel a hand on my hair, fingers gently stroking.</p><p>My heart jumps.</p><p>Tru.</p><p>I flick my eyes open.</p><p>No.</p><p>My heart bottoms out.</p><p>Tru is still sleeping beside me.</p><p>Turning my head slightly, I see my mom standing over me.</p><p>\u201cHi, darling.\u201d She smiles down at me. It\u2019s a careful smile. A smile she\u2019s been using around me a lot lately. I don\u2019t like it.</p><p>\u201cMom?\u201d I rub my eyes with my palms. \u201cWhat time is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little after eight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Eva and Billy?\u201d Picking up my phone, I turn \u201cHurt\u201d off and sit up, sliding my legs over the edge of the bed.</p><p>\u201cNext door with that beautiful son of yours.\u201d Pulling a chair over, she sits bedside. \u201cHave you eaten today?\u201d</p><p>I cast my mind back. I can\u2019t remember the last time I ate anything.</p><p>I shrug.</p><p>She lets out a light sigh, reaches out, and takes hold of my hand.</p><p>I tense up.</p><p>This isn\u2019t the type of relationship we have. My mom is not touchy-feely with me. She used to be that way when I was a kid, but after that night, the night Paul Wethers changed everything for us both irreparably, a barrier slid down between us and it\u2019s been there ever since.</p><p>The last time my mom touched me was at my dad\u2019s funeral, and that was the first time in a long time. I know she did it purely out of guilt.</p><p>Maybe it\u2019s guilt now.</p><p>\u201cJake, you need to eat,\u201d she says in a quiet voice. \u201cYou need to take care of yourself. You never leave this room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do.\u201d My look is as sharp as my tone.</p><p>I\u2019m really not in the mood for this. My last hope at reaching Tru hasn\u2019t worked, so I\u2019m feeling pretty fucking lost right now. The last thing I need is a lecture from my mother.</p><p>She shakes her head. \u201cNo, Jake, you leave this room to go to your son\u2019s room next door. You shower in there.\u201d She jerks her head toward the bathroom. \u201cAnd the few times I\u2019ve seen you eat, it\u2019s been in here. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m saying this, because you know how much I hate it, but you don\u2019t even smoke anymore because it would mean leaving this room. Believe me, I\u2019m happy you\u2019ve stopped smoking, but honestly, if going outside to have a cigarette would get you out of this room for ten minutes, then I\u2019d encourage it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I yank my hand free.</p><p>Her eyes snap to mine. \u201cWhat do you mean, why?\u201d</p><p>Getting to my feet, I stand over her. \u201cWhy do you even care what I do?\u201d</p><p>I see the hurt in her eyes, but she neutralizes it quickly. Pushing the chair back, she stands.</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re my son, and I love you. I might not have given you that impression over the last fifteen years\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEighteen. It\u2019s been eighteen years, Mom.\u201d The disdain in my voice surprises even me.</p><p>What the fuck is wrong with me?</p><p>I move around her, rubbing my suddenly achy head.</p><p>\u201cI let you down, I know that,\u201d she says quietly. \u201cBut not for one moment did I ever stop loving you.\u201d</p><p>I hear the break in her voice, and I see that\u2019s she crying.</p><p>I haven\u2019t seen my mom cry in a very long time. The last time was that night.</p><p>It sparks a pain deep in my chest. One that\u2019s been buried for eighteen years.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do this right now.\u201d I start to back away.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She pulls a tissue from her pocket and dries her eyes. \u201cI just want you to know that I\u2019m sorry I pushed you away.\u201d She drives her fingers through her perfectly styled hair. \u201cI just couldn\u2019t bear what I\u2019d let happen to you. The look in your eyes that night...it was something I never wanted to see again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you pushed me away?\u201d</p><p>What I want to do is yell at her. Tell her that we\u2019re not discussing this. But I\u2019m immobile.</p><p>\u201cJake, I didn\u2019t know I was even pushing you away until it was too late. I was so consumed with making a better life for you after everything you\u2019d been through because of your dad. With that job at Dale\u2019s firm, I was trying to earn enough money to take us away from Manchester before your dad got out of prison. But I was in debt. Your dad had taken a second mortgage out on the house without my knowledge, and when he went to prison, I was left with all of it to pay. I wanted to clear everything up and get you out of there before he came back for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to leave, though.\u201d I glance at Tru. \u201cBut you never asked my opinion, did you, Mom? You just did what suited you.\u201d Then the realization dawns on me. \u201cThat was why you married Dale, wasn\u2019t it? You knew all along he would be transferred to New York.\u201d</p><p>The look in her eyes tells me everything I need to know.</p><p>\u201cYou took me away from Tru,\u201d I say, pointing in her direction. \u201cThe only person I\u2019ve ever loved. Things didn\u2019t get better for me, Mom. They got worse. Yeah, I met Jonny and started the band, but all I did was turn into Dad, and you just stood back and let it happen.\u201d I know my voice is getting louder, but I don\u2019t care. \u201cIf I had been with Tru all along, that would never have happened. She would have kept me straight. None of this would have happened.\u201d I sweep my hand angrily across the room.</p><p>I\u2019m being irrational, I know, but I don\u2019t fucking care. I want to hurt her.</p><p>\u201cI was doing what was best for you.\u201d She reaches for me, but I jerk away.</p><p>\u201cNo. You did what was best for you, like you always do.\u201d</p><p>I yank the door open, stepping out into the hall, trying to find my balance and breathe. I shut it behind me, leaving my mom with Tru.</p><p>My body is thrumming with anger.</p><p>Dave\u2019s already on his feet, eyes on me. I\u2019m guessing he heard all that.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to get some air. Watch Tru for me.\u201d</p><p>He gives me a brisk nod and heads for Tru\u2019s room as I move past him.</p><p>I\u2019ve just reached the exit door when Dave shouts my name.</p><p>Turning, in what feels like slow motion, I catch his eye.</p><p>And I know.</p><p>I don\u2019t think I have ever moved as fast as I do now.</p><p>Barrelling through the door, I push Dave and my mom aside.</p><p>Over the sound of my own heart pounding wildly in my ears, I can hear the monitors attached to Tru beeping loudly.</p><p>Falling to her bedside, I look straight into her open eyes.</p><p>\u201cTru?\u201d I almost choke on the word, my voice strangling to get it out. I reach out my shaking hand, wanting to touch her, but fear holds me back. \u201cTru, baby, I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>Turning to Mom and Dave in the doorway, I yell, \u201cGet the doctor!\u201d</p><p>Dave exits the room, leaving Mom.</p><p>\u201cGet Eva and Billy!\u201d I yell at her. I\u2019m surprised they haven\u2019t heard all the commotion yet.</p><p>Mom hurriedly leaves the room.</p><p>Turning back to Tru, tears blurring my sight, I touch her face gently with my fingertips. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m right here, sweetheart.

Twice.</p><p>I hold her stare, my heart, and my breath as I wait for her to find focus.</p><p>Fear seeps into my stilled heart.</p> <p>I\u2019m so very fucking scared that this isn\u2019t the same Tru. That she doesn\u2019t recognize me. Or worse.</p><p>Kish had warned me that her memory could be affected.

You\u2019re okay.\u201d</p> <p>I watch her eyes, waiting. Desperately waiting to see if this is my Tru.</p><p>She closes her eyes, and I see a tear trickle from the corner of her eye.</p><p>My heart implodes.</p><p>When they open, her gaze hits mine, and I see Tru\u2019s fire in there, the recognition of me in her eyes, and I know she\u2019s back.</p><p>I\u2019ve got my girl back.</p><p>TRU...</p> <p>CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE</p><p>Jake, I know you\u2019re there, I can hear you talking.</p><p>Why isn\u2019t he answering me? Who is he talking to? Why does he sound so upset?</p><p>I need...</p><p>Jake?</p><p>I can barely think. I need to open my eyes but...</p><p>\u201cHurt.\u201d I can hear \u201cHurt\u201d...</p><p>How long have I been awake? Is that Jake yelling? Who is he yelling at?</p> <p>God, my head hurts. My whole body hurts, for that matter.</p><p>I try to open my mouth to speak, to tell him to stop yelling, but my lips feel like they\u2019ve been glued together, and there\u2019s an intense burning sensation in my throat. I\u2019m so thirsty.</p><p>Giving up on talking, I try to move...but I can\u2019t. I feel weighted down.</p><p>Everything hurts. What\u2019s wrong with me? Something\u2019s different. Something\u2019s wrong. I feel wrong.</p><p>Oh God, what\u2019s happening to me?</p><p>Jake, I need you to help me!</p><p>I hear a door bang.</p><p>No! Don\u2019t leave! Please don\u2019t go!</p><p>Fuck!</p><p>I need to move.</p><p>I focus with all my might on moving my left hand. There\u2019s a pain screaming down my right arm and I dare not attempt to move it.</p><p>I\u2019m scared.</p><p>No, you\u2019re okay, Tru. Just keep calm and you\u2019ll be fine.</p><p>Maybe I\u2019m just sick? Yeah, that\u2019ll be it. I\u2019ll have one of those really bad twenty-four-hour flus or something. God, I hope the baby isn\u2019t sick with me.</p><p>I just need to get a part of me moving; then everything else will follow, and I can get to Jake. Once I get to Jake, I\u2019ll feel better.</p><p>I focus on moving my index finger. I feel it move.</p><p>Thank God.</p><p>Gaining confidence, I go to move the rest of my fingers.</p><p>Okay, here we go.</p><p>Flexing them in and out, I shift my left hand and my arm moves with it.</p><p>Okay, I just need to get up now, maybe if I\u2014</p><p>\u201cTrudy?\u201d</p><p>What?</p><p>Who is that? Is that...Susie? Why is she here?</p><p>With huge effort, I wrench my heavy eyes open.</p><p>Everything is foggy. Dark. I can\u2019t get a focus on anything.</p><p>Then I hear voices calling out. More yelling.</p><p>Dave?</p><p>Then Jake...I hear Jake. He\u2019s back.</p><p>Thank God.</p><p>\u201cTru.\u201d He sounds fearful. \u201cTru, baby, I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>Why does he sound so scared?</p><p>Fear starts to prickle my skin. I need my fucking eyes to work! Goddamnit!</p><p>Then Jake\u2019s yelling again, \u201cGet the doctor!\u201d</p><p>Doctor? Where the hell am I?</p><p>\u201cGet Eva and Billy!\u201d</p><p>Mum and Dad?</p><p>I feel his fingers touch my face. \u201cI\u2019m right here, sweetheart. I\u2019ve been here waiting for you. God, baby, I\u2019ve missed you so much.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s missed me?</p><p>At the feel of Jake on my skin, my worry starts to ease. That man has the power of touch, I swear.</p><p>I blink though the haze, desperate to see him. It feels like ages before my eyes focus.</p><p>Then they find his beautiful face.</p><p>He looks really tired. Like he hasn\u2019t slept for days. Worst of all, he looks afraid. I can see it clear in his eyes.</p><p>The last time I saw Jake look like this was when I found that girl in his bed. And that was because he thought he was going to lose me.</p><p>Oh God, what\u2019s happened, baby?</p><p>I need to talk to him.</p><p>With every ounce of strength left in me, I force my lips to part.</p><p>I try to make the words, but my throat screams in pain and the only thing that escapes is a breath.</p><p>\u201cShh, don\u2019t try to talk, sweetheart.\u201d Looking at me with love in his eyes, he smooths my hair back with his hand. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. You\u2019re okay.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s not okay. Nothing about this is okay.</p><p>I close my eyes and feel a tear of frustration squeeze from the corner, running down my temple.</p><p>I open my eyes and meet with Jake\u2019s. I see what I think is a glimmer of relief in his.</p><p>Then the ache in my head intensifies. My eyes feel heavy. I\u2019m struggling to keep them open...</p><p>How long have I been awake? God, my head is pounding like a bitch.</p><p>I move my tongue around. The inside of my mouth feels like the morning after a really bad hangover, and even moving my tongue takes real effort right now.</p><p>Bloody hell, what\u2019s wrong with me?</p><p>I reach into my memories but don\u2019t come up with much, and it hurts my head to try. I remember being in bed with Jake yesterday morning...showering...Jake asking me to stay home. Then...nothing.</p><p>If I didn\u2019t know better, I would think this is the mother of all hangovers, but there is no way it could be\u2014pregnant lady here.</p><p>Well, I might not know why I feel like crap, but what I do know is I really need a drink of water.</p><p>With much effort, I force my gritty eyes open.</p><p>It takes a moment to adjust to the light.</p><p>Ceiling tiles. I can see ceiling tiles. Those really awful ones you find in offices. What do they call them\u2014asbestos ceiling tiles?</p><p>Why would I be somewhere with those? Where the bloody hell am I?</p><p>I take a light breath. My throat burns again.</p><p>Jake.</p><p>Jake\u2019s here. I can smell his scent close by.</p><p>With much effort, I turn my head to the side. Shit, that hurts. Jake\u2019s sitting in a chair by me.</p><p>\u201cHey, baby.\u201d He reaches over and strokes my face, cupping my cheek with his hand.</p><p>I can see tentativeness in him.</p><p>\u201cWh-ere...\u201d God, it hurts so much to get that one word out. It reverberates around my head, setting the pounding off again. Steeling myself, I finish with, \u201cam I?\u201d</p><p>Jake moves closer to me. He leans down and kisses the hand he\u2019s holding, then lifts his head and looks at me. \u201cYou\u2019re in the hospital, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>The hospital? Why? Is the baby okay?</p><p>\u201cBa-by?\u201d I exhale, broken. I try to sit up.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Jake gently eases me back down. Not that I had gotten very far. The pain in my head exploded the moment I tried to lift it. \u201cDon\u2019t try to get up.\u201d</p><p>My eyes move past Jake, down to my bump.</p><p>My heart drops hollow.</p><p>Where my bump was is now a flat, empty surface.</p><p>Oh God, no! No, no, no, no, no! Where\u2019s my baby?</p><p>I want to scream, cry, something...but nothing is working.</p><p>I\u2019ve lost the baby.</p><p>No.</p><p>The pain I feel is unbearable.</p><p>I start shaking my head, uncaring of the pain. Tears run from my eyes, pain pushing them out.</p><p>Jake takes my face in his hands, holding me still. He stares into my eyes.</p><p>\u201cOur baby is fine, Tru. I swear to you.\u201d His voice is filled with so much conviction. Staring into his eyes, my fears start to calm.</p><p>Jake wouldn\u2019t lie to me.</p><p>But if our baby is fine, then why am I not pregnant anymore?</p><p>That means my baby was...born?</p><p>Jake strokes my hair gently, looking at me like he often does\u2014like I\u2019m the most precious thing in the world to him. But this time, with even more intensity. \u201cEverything is fine now, Tru. You\u2019re back and everything\u2019s going to be okay.\u201d I\u2019m not quite sure in this moment if those words are meant for me, or him.</p><p>Jake leans in and kisses my tears away. The feel of his gentle breath against my skin, the warmth of his nearness, is like a salve to wounds I didn\u2019t even know I had.</p><p>He shifts back, looking into my eyes, but keeping my face in his hands. \u201cYou were in a car accident, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>Fragments of memories instantly blur into my mind. I was at the spa with Simone...Dave waited in the parking lot all day for us...I teased him about it...we were all driving home, listening to Pearl Jam...\u201cJust Breathe\u201d...then...nothing.</p><p>Simone. Dave.</p><p>It must be the look on my face that prompts Jake to say, \u201cSimone and Dave are fine. The impact was on the passenger side. Your side.\u201d He sounds like he\u2019s in physical pain as he says these words. Jake pushes my hair behind my ear using his fingertips. \u201cYou were in a bad way. I thought I was going to lose you...\u201d His voice breaks, his eyes filling with tears.</p><p>Slowly, with much effort, I lift my good hand and touch his face. \u201cI\u2019m...okay,\u201d I reassure him.</p><p>He holds my hand to his face, kissing the palm.</p><p>A tear drips from his eye and lands on my cheek. I can literally feel the pain it represents.</p><p>\u201cYou hurt your head real bad in the accident.\u201d His eyes flick from mine to my forehead. \u201cYou were in surgery. Our baby was in distress. The doctors had to perform an emergency C-section, Tru. He was born before I even got to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>He.</p><p>I watch him, stilled by his words. \u201cWe have a son, Tru. And he\u2019s beautiful.\u201d</p><p>A son. We have a son.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s doing real good. He\u2019s breathing on his own now. It took a while before he could, but a few days ago they removed his ventilator and he did great. God, he\u2019s so amazing, Tru. He\u2019s growing stronger every day. They said he should be able to start feeding from a bottle in a week or so.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help but cry again. These tears are sheer happiness. Nothing else matters to me right now other than knowing my baby is here and he is healthy.</p><p>Then I realise\u2014I haven\u2019t been asleep for a day. Everything Jake\u2019s said to me, from the way he\u2019s talking and the way he\u2019s looking at me...I\u2019ve been away for longer than just a day.</p><p>Moistening my lips, I part them to speak. \u201cHow...long?\u201d</p><p>His eyes dip. \u201cYou were in a coma for seven days.\u201d</p><p>I inhale sharply, causing the burning to start in my throat again.</p><p>Seven days. My son has been here all that time without me.</p><p>\u201cYou first woke up two days ago. But you kept coming in and out of consciousness. Kish told me that was perfectly normal\u2014oh, Dr. Kish. He\u2019s the doctor who\u2019s been taking care of you,\u201d he explains at my questioning expression. \u201cThe first time you woke up was for a few minutes, but you didn\u2019t talk. For the last two days, you\u2019ve been here a little. Sometimes you\u2019d open your eyes for a few seconds. Sometimes minutes. You even mumbled a few incoherent words. But this is the first time you\u2019ve actually talked to me. This is the longest you\u2019ve stayed awake, so I\u2019m taking this as a good sign.\u201d He smiles, but it\u2019s not one of my Jake smiles. It looks forced. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI haven\u2019t left you, Tru.

There\u2019s only a wall separating me from my son.</p><p>\u201cI want...see him,\u201d I force out.</p><p>\u201cI know, sweetheart.\u201d He strokes my cheek with his thumb. \u201cBut I think I should get Kish now that you\u2019re fully awake to let him check you over.

They\u2019ll want to see you.\u201d</p> <p>And I want to see my son.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I shake my head.

I\u2019ve missed the first week of his life.</p><p>I\u2019ve missed those important first moments. The moments when a mother bonds with her child and he bonds with her. They were taken away from me. I can\u2019t ever get them back.</p><p>What if I can\u2019t bond with him now? What if he rejects me?</p> <p>He doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019ve not been with him for the start of his life. To him, I\u2019ll be a stranger.</p><p>We don\u2019t know each other.</p><p>What do I say\u2014do?</p><p>I know he\u2019s only a baby and won\u2019t understand what I\u2019m saying, but these first moments between us now are crucial, and I\u2019m lying in a bed, struggling to move and in pain every time I speak.</p><p>I hate that I haven\u2019t been here for him. I hate that this is how I\u2019m meeting my son for the first time.</p><p>This was not how I imagined it.</p><p>I imagined my baby being handed to me, holding him in my arms. Giving him to Jake to hold for the first time. Watching as Jake had his first moments with our son.</p><p>Not having my child pulled from me while I was unconscious and Jake was on his way to the hospital.</p> <p>Loss for what should have been ours overwhelms me. Visions of what happened form in my mind, forcing fresh tears to my eyes.</p><p>My son was born alone, surrounded by strangers.</p><p>I\u2019m just so thankful he\u2019s had Jake with him ever since.</p><p>But it makes my heart hurt that Jake has had to cope with this alone\u2014take care of me and become a dad all on his own.</p><p>I can\u2019t even imagine how Jake felt when he was told what happened. If it were him, I know it would have killed me.</p><p>I know without a doubt that Jake and our son will have bonded, and I am so happy for that. I\u2019m just afraid he won\u2019t bond with me, that he might reject me.</p><p>I don\u2019t know how I will cope with that.</p><p>And now instead of being excited to meet my son, I\u2019m terrified.</p><p>I hear the door open, then the squeak of wheels and two sets of feet.</p><p>My body starts to tremble, my heart beats erratically.</p><p>I close my eyes, afraid.</p><p>I don\u2019t think I can do this.</p><p>\u201cPut him over by the bed,\u201d I hear Jake say.</p><p>The squeaky wheels grow ever closer. Then they stop and I hear the sound of a plug being put it in the socket, a switch being turned on, and the gentle hum of a machine.</p><p>\u201cGive me a holler when you want a hand bringing him back through,\u201d I hear a female voice say. Then the door closes.</p><p>I feel the bed dip as Jake sits down by my legs. \u201cTru.\u201d His voice is soft. \u201cAre you awake?\u201d</p><p>I know I made him get the baby, but now I\u2019m scared. I hesitate, actually considering faking sleep, and immediately hate myself for it.</p><p>I nod.</p><p>\u201cOpen your eyes.\u201d His voice is still soft, but there\u2019s a quiet command in it.</p><p>Taking a burning breath, I whisper, \u201cI\u2019m...afraid.\u201d</p><p>I hear a light sigh escape Jake. He takes my hand in his. I curl my fingers around his hand. \u201cI know, baby...\u201d I can tell he\u2019s talking from experience. \u201cBut I promise, one look at him, Tru...that\u2019s all it takes. Trust me.\u201d</p><p>So I do. I open my eyes and turn my head to the side. There he is, in an incubator pushed up against the side of my bed. I see him, and it\u2019s love at first sight.</p><p>He is beautiful. The most beautiful thing I have ever seen.</p><p>I can\u2019t remember ever feeling a love like this before. It\u2019s equally as powerful as the love I feel for Jake, but so very different.</p><p>A mother\u2019s love.</p><p>God, I can see so much of Jake in him.</p><p>He has the same furrow Jake has in his brow when he\u2019s sleeping.</p><p>Any worries of not bonding with him are gone. I just love him, completely. And I start to cry instantly.</p><p>Jake squeezes my hand. \u201cHey, don\u2019t cry. He\u2019s okay in there, really. It\u2019s just keeping him warm.\u201d</p><p>Jake thinks I\u2019m crying because I\u2019m worried that\u2019s he\u2019s in an incubator. Of course I\u2019m concerned about the incubator, but that\u2019s not why I\u2019m crying right now. I\u2019m crying because I\u2019m happy.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you touch him?\u201d Jake suggests. \u201cThat might make you feel better. It helped me the first time I saw him.\u201d</p><p>I start to free my hand from Jake\u2019s when he says, \u201cHang on.\u201d</p><p>Jake releases my hand and disappears into the bathroom.</p><p>It\u2019s then for the first time that I notice the tubes taped to my arm. I follow them up and see them attached to two different drips.</p><p>I glance at my right arm and see a cast covering it, my hand swaddled in bandage.</p><p>Jake said I hurt my head in the accident.</p><p>I lift my good hand to it and feel a thick bandage on my head.</p><p>\u201cI just need to clean your hand before you touch him,\u201d Jake tells me, reappearing with a bottle of gel.</p><p>I smile at him. He sounds so responsible. In a way, he sounds like my dad would.</p><p>That\u2019s because he is a dad. He\u2019s had over a week learning how to be one.</p><p>Today is my first day as a mother.</p><p>Forcing back a wave of fresh tears, I chance a quick glance at Jake and see him squeeze some gel out and rub it over his hands. Then he squeezes another blob into his hand, sits back down on the bed, takes my hand in his, and starts gently working the gel into my hand.</p><p>It\u2019s cold on my skin, but Jake soon warms me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re good to go.\u201d He smiles, giving my hand one last rub.</p><p>I grin at him.</p><p>Taking my hand from his, I slowly put it through the porthole, keeping my eyes on my baby boy.</p><p>The instant my fingertips touch the soft downy skin on his tiny hand, sensations explode under my skin, tunnelling straight for my heart.</p><p>He is perfect.</p><p>I could spend forever here with him like this.</p><p>I have so many questions about him that I want to ask Jake, but I don\u2019t think my throat will hold out, so I ask the important one.</p><p>\u201cName?\u201d</p><p>Jake shakes his head, smiling gently. \u201cI haven\u2019t named him. I was waiting for you. That honour is all yours, Tru.\u201d</p><p>My heart crumbles.</p><p>I stare at my son, thinking of all the names I had come up with...all the ones Jake hated.</p><p>\u201cHe still like...rock songs?\u201d I grate out.</p><p>A small chuckle escapes Jake. \u201cYeah, I sing to him a lot\u2014the old favourites. I think we might have a mini\u2013rock star on our hands.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head, smiling. A rock star needs a rock star\u2019s name, right? A smile curves my lips. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Jake gives me a suspicious look, humour in his eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s something crazy, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I croak out, giving him an affronted look. \u201cI thought...\u201d I pause, swallowing through the burning. \u201cJonathan Jacob.\u201d</p><p>The look on Jake\u2019s face right now is beautiful.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re giving him Jonny\u2019s name?\u201d I watch him gulp down the words.</p><p>\u201cAnd yours.\u201d</p><p>Jake bends close and gently kisses my lips. \u201cI love it. I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove you,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>From out of nowhere our little boy curls his fingers around my little finger, the one that was still gently stroking his skin, gripping tightly for his small size.</p><p>I laugh softly in surprise, turning to look at him.</p><p>\u201cHe does that a lot, he likes to hold on to your finger,\u201d Jake tells me, running his own fingers along the crook of my arm. \u201cI think he likes his name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d I smile.</p><p>\u201cYeah...\u201d Moving away, Jake walks around the bed, kicks his shoes off, and carefully climbs onto the space beside me. Lying on his side, his head on the pillow, he says into my ear, \u201cI missed you so much.\u201d</p><p>His breath tickles my skin.</p><p>I turn my face to him and he leans in and kisses me softly on the lips.</p><p>Turning from Jake, I move my gaze back to my son. I\u2019m finding it hard not to look at him.</p><p>Jake\u2019s arm goes across my waist. \u201cHe looks like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, like you.\u201d Beautiful like you, Jake.</p><p>He laughs softly. \u201cNo, he definitely looks like you. Everyone agrees with me.\u201d</p><p>Everyone agrees.</p><p>Everyone else got to see my baby before I did. Sadness pokes at my heart.</p><p>Brushing over my sadness, I shake my head in disagreement.</p><p>Jake chuckles, then presses his lips to the skin between my neck and shoulder blade. It tickles down my spine; even the parts of me that are in pain shiver with delight at the feel of Jake\u2019s lips on me.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got your lips and your colouring,\u201d Jake says against my skin, still kissing me.</p><p>\u201cThis...gonna go on for...while,\u201d I force out, giving him a quick look, eyes smiling.</p><p>\u201cForever,\u201d he replies, and I know he\u2019s not talking about the disagreement anymore. Burying his face into my neck, he takes a ragged breath. \u201cI love you so much, Tru. Thank you for coming back to me.\u201d</p><p>I press my cheek against the top of his head. \u201cI...always will.\u201d</p><p>He tightens his hold on me. That\u2019s how we stay.</p><p>Jake\u2019s holding on to me, and I\u2019m holding on to our son.</p><p>The three of us are together, and nothing is ever going to keep us apart again.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR</p><p>It\u2019s been three months since the accident. Three months since my beautiful son, JJ, was born.</p><p>We called him Jonathan Jacob for a day, and then Jake shortened it to JJ, and that\u2019s what everyone has been calling him since.</p><p>I spent just over two months in the hospital recovering. Initially it was bed rest, letting myself heal. Then I started daily physiotherapy once my arm and hand had healed.</p><p>I also saw a counsellor twice a week. Dr. Kish recommended it. I may not remember the actual accident, but he said I\u2019d been though a terrible trauma, and while I might not remember it on the surface, it\u2019s still buried deep within me. Talking about the accident with someone would help.</p><p>And he was right.</p><p>I went through phases of emotions. One day I\u2019d be on top of the world, feeling extremely lucky to be alive, knowing I could have died. Then the next day, I would be angry. Angry this had happened to me. Angry I had missed the birth of my son. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Then I had bouts of depression.</p><p>I wanted to stay positive and happy all the time, but when the black hit, there was nothing I could do about it.</p><p>And through all of this, Jake was right there with me.</p><p>The day they removed the bandage from my head, I sobbed. The scar on my head was red and angry, running a few inches back from my hairline, over my scalp, and a huge patch of my hair was missing where it had been shaved off for the surgery.</p> <p>I felt hideous.</p><p>When I said this to Jake, he held me in his arms.</p><p>\u201cWe can always make a fashion statement out of it, sweetheart. I can shave a patch of my hair off too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t suit the bald look.\u201d I smiled through my tears.</p><p>\u201cNah, you\u2019re probably right. But you do.\u201d He took my face in his hands, brushing my tears away with his thumbs, the tip of his nose resting against mine. \u201cYou suit every look, Tru. You are beautiful to me right now. You are beautiful to me always, no matter what.\u201d</p> <p>Jake knew how much it bothered me, so once I was able to, once the scar had near to healed and my hair had grown back a little, Jake had a hairdresser come to the hospital and put some extensions in. Once she was finished, you couldn\u2019t tell there was a scar unless you were looking for it.</p><p>Jake has done everything possible to help me get back to the person I was before the accident. Because of his help, I\u2019m almost there.</p><p>I don\u2019t sleep great. I suffer with nightmares. I have blinding headaches to contend with along with shooting pains in my right arm, and my right hand isn\u2019t as strong as it used to be. But I\u2019m lucky to be alive, and I make sure to remind myself of that every single day. It doesn\u2019t take much, I just look at Jake and JJ and know how lucky I am, that I have everything in the world to be thankful for because I have them.</p><p>I haven\u2019t spent a night away from JJ since that day Jake brought him into my hospital room.</p><p>Jake had JJ moved into my room. Of course, Jake was there with us too.</p><p>It became our home away from home. I even spent my birthday there.</p> <p>Well, it wasn\u2019t like I could go out celebrating, so Jake brought the celebration to me, and we had a miniparty with Mum and Dad, Simone, Denny, Stuart, Josh, Smith, and Carly. Even Susie and Dale were there. Tom was away, so he couldn\u2019t be.</p><p>Jake had Pizza Hut brought in, and he bought me seven gifts to catch up to the twelve missed, then another to mark my actual birthday.</p><p>The seven gifts were a charm bracelet. The bracelet was one and six charms made up the others. Each one meant something to us\u2014a slice of pizza, a little Eiffel Tower, a guitar, a cupcake, a piano, and a scroll charm inscribed with \u201cBest Friends.\u201d</p><p>My present for my actual birthday was diamond earrings from Tiffany to match my locket.</p><p>He put so much thought into my gifts. But that\u2019s Jake. Where I\u2019m concerned, he puts thought into everything.</p><p>The only downside to my party was the tension between Jake and Susie. It wasn\u2019t noticeable to the others, but it was to me.</p><p>After everyone had left, I asked Jake what was going on.</p><p>He told me about the discussion he and Susie had right before I woke up from my coma. When he said \u201cdiscussion,\u201d I knew it was an argument.</p> <p>It made my heart hurt for him, hearing what was said between them. I told Jake he needs to make some workable relationship with Susie because she\u2019s JJ\u2019s grandma. Kids are smart\u2014JJ will pick up on the tension between them as he starts to grow, so they need to talk it out sooner rather than later.</p><p>I know he hasn\u2019t talked with Susie yet, but he will, and soon, now that I\u2019m back on my feet. I\u2019ll make sure of it.</p><p>I don\u2019t care what he says. He needs his mum.</p><p>I know that even more, now that I am one.</p><p>In the beginning with JJ, it was hard not being able to do the things a mother should for her baby, like change his nappy, bathe him, and soothe him when he cried.</p><p>I felt useless. And it frustrated the hell out of me.</p><p>I had to watch Jake do it all, but he made sure to include me as much as possible, and in truth, I loved watching Jake with him.</p><p>He\u2019s so sweet and loving with JJ. He treats him like precious cargo. And no matter how many times I tell Jake not to let JJ fall asleep in his arms, to put him down in his crib, he still lets him. Our boy has Jake wrapped around his finger, and it warms my heart to see.</p><p>Jake is everything a dad should be and more. I knew he had it in him, and I made sure to tell him one night in the hospital.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really good at this,\u201d I said over the sound of JJ wailing, while I watched Jake give him his first proper bath.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help\u2014my arm was still set in a cast\u2014so I sat by the baby bath, watching instead.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know about that.\u201d He gave me a quick panicked look. \u201cI think I might be doing it wrong. He\u2019s done nothing but cry since I started bathing him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing it right. It\u2019s just new to him, that\u2019s all. He\u2019s just telling you, quite loudly, that he\u2019s not sure about this bathing business.\u201d I gave him an encouraging smile.</p><p>\u201cYeah, and he definitely gets the loud from your side of the family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa!\u201d I laughed and gave him the middle finger.</p><p>\u201cDid you just flip me the bird?\u201d he asked, deadpan, rinsing the soap from JJ\u2019s hair with water from the sponge.</p><p>\u201cLooked like it.\u201d I grinned.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t ever remember you doing that\u2014what\u2019s happened to my sweet girl?\u201d</p><p>Getting to my feet, I grabbed JJ\u2019s towel and handed it to Jake. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I was ever sweet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were. You still are.\u201d He leant close and kissed me on the lips. \u201cExcept for when you\u2019re flipping me the bird, that is.\u201d</p><p>I stepped back, my lips still tingling from his kiss. \u201cIt must be all the time I\u2019ve spent around foul-mouthed rock stars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you haven\u2019t noticed, I hardly curse anymore. Not around JJ, anyway,\u201d he said, grinning, as he wrapped the towel around him, swaddling him up in it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve noticed.\u201d I smiled, climbing up on the bed.</p><p>I\u2019ve noticed a lot of things about Jake lately. He hardly ever smokes anymore. I think he\u2019s well on his way to quitting completely. He never curses while JJ\u2019s around, which is all the time.</p><p>Jake has always been in control of everything around him, but never relaxed...now he\u2019s relaxed.</p><p>He has slipped into his dad role with perfection, and he hasn\u2019t even realised it.</p><p>I watched silently in fascination while Jake dried JJ\u2019s skin with care and precision, put his cream on for his dry skin, then put on his nappy, or diaper, as he calls them, and dressed him in the cute blue onesie that my mum bought for him.</p><p>Jake then brought JJ over to me with the bottle that he\u2019d put in the warmer right before JJ\u2019s bath, and laid him down on the bed beside me so I could feed him.</p><p>Like I said, he\u2019s the perfect dad.</p><p>Jake sat with us, and we both watched in silence while JJ drank his milk. It didn\u2019t take him long\u2014he\u2019s got a healthy appetite. Then about ten seconds later, with his belly full, he fell asleep.</p><p>Jake carefully picked him up and put him in his crib by the bed. Then turned the light out and climbed in bed beside me.</p><p>This was one of my favourite parts of the day. Of course, I love spending every minute with JJ, but I loved the quiet moment at night when it was just me and Jake in the dark, together.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so good with him,\u201d I whispered. \u201cYou\u2019re an amazing dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m only good because of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I turned to him. \u201cThis is all you, Jake, and it\u2019s about time you realise that. You are everything a dad should be to our son, and more. JJ\u2019s lucky to have you.\u201d</p><p>His arms went around me, and his lips pressed a kiss against my shoulder. \u201cI guess I\u2019m doing okay. But I\u2019m the lucky one, believe me.\u201d</p><p>Jake hasn\u2019t spent a moment away from JJ and me since the moment I woke. He\u2019s put everything into us.</p><p>He had Zane handle things at the label. What work he could do, he did at the hospital or at home when I was finally released.</p><p>The guys put a pause on working on the album, but I want them all to get back to finishing it soon. A world with no more TMS music wouldn\u2019t be a world at all.</p><p>Tom even pitched in when Dina, Vintage\u2019s manager, broke her leg skiing when they were about to go on a six-week tour across the States. That\u2019s why he couldn\u2019t make my birthday.</p><p>I was still in the early days of my recovery at the time, and it was stressing Jake to no end to find a new manager for Vintage he could trust, and Tom offered his services.</p><p>He\u2019s never managed a band before, but he\u2019s spent most of his life on the road touring.</p><p>Jake thought it was a brilliant idea. At first I thought it was because Tom was still trying to get in Lyla\u2019s pants, but Jake said it was because he genuinely wanted to help. Then I felt bad for thinking it.</p><p>In all honesty, I\u2019ve seen a different Tom of late since he got back from Vintage\u2019s tour. Actually, he was a little different before he went away.</p><p>It\u2019s like something has changed in him. The new Tom is freaking me out\u2014he hardly ever talks about sex or the women he\u2019s slept with. He still manages to make a crack about my breasts, though, to wind Jake up, so I know a bit of the old Tom is still in there somewhere, thankfully.</p><p>I never thought I\u2019d say this, but I\u2019d miss the old Tom if he changed completely and that Tom making cracks about the size of my breasts is comforting\u2014weird thought, huh?</p><p>So anyway, I digressed a little\u2014okay, a lot.</p><p>I\u2019ve been out of the hospital for three weeks now, and we\u2019ve settled into life at home with JJ, though I\u2019m not actually at home at the moment. I\u2019m at my old home, my first home, the currently blissfully warm Manchester.</p><p>Jake, JJ, Stuart, Dave, Ben, and I flew in a few days ago. Jake has some business to do here. It has something to do with the label, and he\u2019s been a little vague about it. Why he\u2019d have business in Manchester, I have no clue. It\u2019s usually London.</p><p>Jake didn\u2019t want to be away from JJ and me, so we came along. Not that I needed my arm twisted\u2014I didn\u2019t fancy being away from Jake either, and I\u2019d take any excuse to come home, as it means being able to spend more time with my folks.</p><p>They came back home once I was released from the hospital. They had both spent so much time off work, and they had to go back.</p><p>I got so used to seeing them every day that I\u2019ve missed them since they left.</p><p>But one person I don\u2019t have to miss anymore is Simone.</p><p>The day after I woke from my coma, Simone and Stuart came to visit me, and Simone had some news.</p><p>Simone came bursting into my room, with Stuart close behind. She took one look at me and burst into tears.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t look that bad, do I?\u201d I joked, knowing I actually did.</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014I,\u201d she hiccupped.</p><p>\u201cSimone, I\u2019m fine, I promise,\u201d I reassured her.</p><p>She stumbled across the room, swiping at her tears, and plunked herself down on the bed, then practically threw herself on top of me, wrapping her arms around me. \u201cI thought I\u2019d lost you,\u201d she sniffled. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I could feel her tears soaking through my nightie, and she was hurting my C-section scar.

I could see his eyes shining with tears. Seeing him looking at me like that made the tears I\u2019d been holding in spill over. Stuart took my face in his hands and kissed me square on the lips. \u201cYou frightened the shit out of me, chica. Don\u2019t ever do it again,\u201d he whispered close to my lips.</p><p>\u201cCross my heart.\u201d I smiled, making the sign over my chest.</p><p>\u201cGood girl.\u201d Rubbing my tears away with his thumb, he moved off the bed and sat on one of the chairs.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s JJ?\u201d Simone asked, glancing around the room.</p><p>\u201cJake took him downstairs for his checkup in the NICU.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe little guy\u2019s doing okay?\u201d Stuart asked.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s doing great.\u201d Without fail, the thought of JJ brought a smile to my face.</p><p>\u201cStuart and I really wanted to come and see you last night, but Jake said you were exhausted from your folks visiting and all the tests, so he said we would have to wait until this morning to see you,\u201d Simone said.</p><p>\u201cI was pretty zapped,\u201d I said.</p><p>I was knackered yesterday, but I think Jake put them off because he wanted some alone time with me, after having to share me for the best part of the day. And honestly, I wanted time with him too.</p><p>\u201cDid you get the flowers I sent yesterday?\u201d Simone asked, glancing around at the numerous bouquets of flowers and cards around the room.</p> <p>\u201cI did, and I got yours too,\u201d I added, glancing at Stuart. \u201cThey\u2019re gorgeous. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>Stuart waved me off, in that way he does.</p><p>\u201cLooks like you didn\u2019t need any more, though, you\u2019ve got tons,\u201d Simone said, getting up from her seat. She started checking out the bouquets and reading the cards. \u201cHoly fuck!\u201d she exclaimed, spinning on the spot, waving a card around. \u201cDid you seriously get a bouquet of flowers from the president?\u201d</p><p>I laughed. That had been my exact reaction when they arrived first thing this morning.</p><p>\u201cApparently, when you\u2019re the fianc\u00e9e of Jake Wethers and you\u2019re in a serious car accident, it qualifies you for big-time flowers. I seriously doubt he ordered them himself, but it\u2019s still really nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo kidding! Bloody hell,\u201d she muttered. \u201cI\u2019d frame this card if I were you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I will. I\u2019ve already asked Jake to order me a frame.\u201d I laughed. But I wasn\u2019t kidding, I actually had.</p><p>I watched her put the card back in with the flowers and sit down in the chair by my bed.</p> <p>\u201cSo how are you doing?\u201d I asked, looking at the bandage on her wrist, noticing the yellow bruises on her face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good.\u201d She smiled. It looked a little forced.</p><p>\u201cSimone...,\u201d I pushed.</p><p>\u201cReally, I\u2019m fine. My injuries were minor compared to\u2014\u201d</p><p>It was at that moment she chose to brush her hair away from her face.</p><p>\u201cHoly fuck!\u201d I said, reaching forward, grabbing her left hand. \u201cIs that what I think it is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ!\u201d Stuart said, pulling her hand from mine to examine the huge-ass rock on her finger. \u201cHow in the hell did I miss this? I must be losing my touch!\u201d He scratched his head.</p><p>\u201cOh my God! You\u2019re getting married!\u201d I squealed. I didn\u2019t even care that it hurt my throat. \u201cTo Denny!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She looked a little sheepish. \u201cHe asked me last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cArghh!\u201d Stuart and I cried in unison. \u201cThis is awesome!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d She looked down at her hands and started picking at her nails. Simone only does that when she\u2019s worried about something.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d I asked, concerned. \u201cYou do want to marry Denny, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I do. I just...\u201d She let out a sigh. \u201cI just feel a bit shitty.\u201d She looked up at me. \u201cYou\u2019re here in the hospital recovering after being in a coma for a week, and I come to visit you...I just feel bad being excited about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be soft,\u201d I chastised. \u201cThis is exactly the kind of news I need to hear right now. And you were in that accident too, Simone\u2014you deserve happiness more than anyone I know. So come on, tell us. How did he ask?\u201d</p><p>Her expression turned doe-eyed and I knew I had her. \u201cAfter Jake wouldn\u2019t let us see you, I was a bit bummed, so Denny suggested we go out for dinner.\u201d She bit down on a smile, and I could see how happy she was. \u201cWe ate at an Italian restaurant near his place, and he was acting a little odd all night, but I just let it go. Then on the way back to his house, he suggested going for a walk in Echo Park. We walked for a bit, and then he stopped me up by the lake, got down on one knee, pulled a ring box out, and said, \u2018I bought this ring a month ago, and I\u2019ve been carrying it around with me ever since, trying to find the right way to ask you to marry me. The day of the accident, coming so close to losing you, I wanted to ask you then, but it seemed out of place with everything that was going on. But now Tru\u2019s awake, I\u2019m not waiting any longer.\u2019 He took a deep breath and said, \u2018Will you marry me?\u2019 Then he popped open the box and pulled the ring out. I cried, and said yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod love that boy,\u201d Stuart said as we both let out a dreamy sigh.</p><p>\u201cDoes that mean you\u2019ll be moving here?\u201d I asked, hoping and praying.</p><p>She grinned. \u201cWe haven\u2019t really talked everything through yet, but yeah, I reckon I\u2019ll be moving here.\u201d</p><p>So thanks to the ever-gorgeous Denny, I get to see Simone practically every day.</p><p>And thanks to Jake using his contacts, he managed to help get Simone an interview for a top PR firm in LA, and of course she got the job.</p><p>She handed her notice in at her old firm and officially moved out here two weeks ago.</p><p>She and Denny are getting married this December. A winter wedding. I can\u2019t wait! JJ is going to be page boy and I\u2019m the maid of honor.</p><p>With the way things are looking, Simone and Denny will be married before Jake and me.</p><p>It\u2019s funny how things work out.</p><p>Jake and I haven\u2019t talked about when we\u2019re getting married. In all honesty, we\u2019ve talked about everything but, and I\u2019m not really sure why.</p><p>Actually, talking is the only thing Jake and I have done since I got out of the hospital. We haven\u2019t made love since before the accident.</p><p>Jake hasn\u2019t made a move on me. But then, neither have I with him.</p><p>I guess I\u2019m feeling self-conscious about my body after the accident and having JJ.</p><p>There was no way we were having sex in the hospital. I was healing, for starters, and toward the end, when I was almost better...well, it just wasn\u2019t happening there. Now we\u2019ve been home for two weeks. We kiss, but it has yet to go further than that.</p><p>I\u2019m not sure why. Well, I know why on my part, but not on Jake\u2019s.</p><p>I\u2019d be lying if I said I wasn\u2019t worried.</p><p>But then, Jake has so much going, taking care of me and JJ.</p><p>I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll get back to that side of our relationship soon.</p><p>I have a lot to be happy about. I\u2019m with the man I love, the man I was always destined to be with, and together we have the most beautiful baby boy this world has ever seen.</p><p>Speaking of my baby boy, I\u2019m missing him at the moment.</p><p>He\u2019s with my mum and dad. And I\u2019m in a car right now, destination unknown.</p><p>You see, Jake has a surprise for me, and Dave is driving me to that surprise. You know what that means...yep, I\u2019m blindfolded.</p><p>Dave is still my bodyguard and driver.</p><p>When I found out that Dave had spent the vast duration of the time I was in the coma guarding my room, I asked Jake to bring him in to see me.</p><p>We talked for a long time.</p><p>Dave blamed himself for the accident, which was crazy, and I told him so. There was no way he could have prevented the accident any more than me or Simone could have. The only one who could have prevented it is buried in a cemetery right now.</p><p>I would, and still do, trust Dave with my life.</p><p>That doesn\u2019t mean that riding in a car is easy for me now, because it\u2019s not.</p><p>It\u2019s a challenge I face every day.</p><p>The first ride I had to take in a car after the accident was horrendous. It was the day I left the hospital. I was shaking with nerves. Even though I don\u2019t remember the crash, just knowing I was in one was enough.</p><p>It took me nearly twenty minutes before I could muster up the courage to get in.</p><p>I sat in the back with JJ, who was in his car seat, while Jake drove us home. I focused on JJ the entire time. It felt like the longest car ride of my life.</p><p>I can\u2019t remember ever being so afraid.</p><p>But I had to do it. I can\u2019t spend the rest of my life fearing being in a car.</p><p>I\u2019m slowly getting there. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m still jittery every time I\u2019m in a car. Just like I am now. But it\u2019s getting better.</p><p>\u201cHow much longer?\u201d I ask Dave from the backseat, fingers curled around the edge of the seat, my foot nervously tapping the mat under my ballet pumps. I know I sound like a whiny kid in the back of her parents\u2019 car, but Dave is used to my angst. He understands it. He\u2019s the only other person aside from Simone who does.</p><p>\u201cAnother five minutes at the most,\u201d he replies.</p><p>\u201cHow long has it been already?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThirty minutes. We\u2019ll be there real soon, I promise. Try to relax. I\u2019m taking it real steady, and I\u2019m sticking to the speed limit. You remember what I told you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat lightning doesn\u2019t strike twice.\u201d I exhale. It\u2019s a motto Dave told me to remember while in the car.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re golden, Tru. I promise you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I loosen my death grip from around the seat, trying to relax. \u201cYou definitely can\u2019t tell me where it is I\u2019m going?\u201d</p><p>He lets out a deep chuckle. \u201cMore than my life\u2019s worth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFigured,\u201d I grumble, folding my arms across my chest.</p><p>I\u2019m so ready to find out what this surprise is and get back to JJ.</p><p>I haven\u2019t seen Jake all day, or Stuart for that matter. They\u2019ve both been quite absent since we arrived in Manchester. I\u2019ve not minded, though. I know Jake is here for business, and I\u2019ve kept busy with JJ and spending time with Mum and Dad.</p><p>I was expecting them back at dinnertime, but then I received this cryptic text message from Jake at three in the afternoon, telling me he has a surprise for me. I\u2019m to leave JJ with my mum and dad, get in the car with Dave, put on this bloody blindfold, and he\u2019d see me soon.</p><p>So here I am, driving to wherever my surprise is.</p><p>I lean my head back against the headrest and fold my arms in my lap, fiddling with my engagement ring. \u201cCan you put some decent music on? This song is driving me nuts.\u201d It\u2019s some annoying boy band I\u2019ve never heard of before. \u201cOh, but not Pearl Jam,\u201d I add. \u201cI don\u2019t want to tempt fate and set that lightning to strike twice.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSee, that was quite funny.\u201d Dave chuckles. \u201cYou\u2019re getting there.\u201d</p><p>I touch my head where my scar is. \u201cThe only way to get through the bad stuff is to laugh about it, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>I listen as he flicks through the radio stations.</p> <p>\u201cGo back to one,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>Dave jumps back a station, and Jake\u2019s voice fills up the car.</p><p>\u201cThrough It All,\u201d the song he sang for me in Copenhagen, the first night we slept together.</p><p>I always think of that night as the start of Jake and me, but in truth we started a long time ago. We started the very first moment we laid eyes on each other through our shared garden fence all those years ago.</p><p>It just took us a long time to get there.</p> <p>CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE</p><p>As Jake\u2019s song ends, I feel the car come to stop.</p><p>My door opens. \u201cYou look beautiful.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help smiling at Jake\u2019s words.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say the same to you, but it\u2019d help if I could see.\u201d I tap my finger against the ever-present blindfold.</p><p>\u201cOh, you know me, baby. I always look hot.\u201d</p> <p>I laugh.</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d I feel his hands take hold of mine, and he guides me out of the car.</p><p>I step out into the warm late-afternoon air. The ground is hard under my feet, but I\u2019m definitely on grass. Jake slips his arm around my waist and guides me on.</p><p>The sound of running water hits my ears.</p><p>I think I know where I am.</p><p>I bite down on the smile the thought brings so Jake doesn\u2019t know I\u2019ve figured it out. I know how important the actual surprise is to him.</p><p>After less than a minute of walking, Jake stops me. I feel him move behind me and undo the blindfold. I hold my breath in anticipation of whether I\u2019m right or not.</p><p>Holy shit.</p> <p>My breath comes out in a rush.</p><p>Yes, I\u2019m at Lumb Falls, but this is...wow. Just bloody wow.</p><p>No more than fifty feet before me, on the bank overlooking the falls, is a wooden structure that could only be described as an altar.</p><p>There are fairy lights woven around it, intricate with white and pink flowers, dressing it up to beautiful.</p><p>Dozens of lanterns hang from the nearby trees. A couple of rows of chairs are set on both sides, and down the middle is an aisle covered with pink and white rose petals.</p><p>I turn to Jake, my mouth wide in awe and wonder. \u201cWha...I...you did all of this?\u201d</p><p>His mouth lifts at the corner as he pushes his hands into his jeans pockets. He shrugs lightly. \u201cI want to marry you, Tru.\u201d He takes a step closer to me. My heart starts to thump. \u201cBut if I\u2019ve got this all wrong and today\u2019s not that day\u2014that this isn\u2019t how you saw us getting married\u2014then that\u2019s okay, I\u2019ll wait. If you want a big church wedding, then I want that too. I just want you, any way I can have you. But today...well, I at least wanted to try and see if my girl would marry me in our special place. The girl who, twenty-four years ago to the day, stepped into my life with her big brown eyes, her hair in pigtails, sucking on a lollipop as she stared across at me through the garden fence and said, \u2018I\u2019m Trudy, you want a lollipop?\u2019\u201d</p><p>I let out a laugh as tears fill my eyes, realising what today\u2019s date is: August 31. The day Jake and I met.</p><p>\u201cSo have I got this right? Is today that day?\u201d he asks, cupping his hands around my face.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I breathe, leaning forward, pressing my lips to his. \u201cYes, it is.\u201d</p><p>I touch his face with my hands. My beautiful Jake.</p><p>I can\u2019t believe he has done all of this without my knowing. I seriously had no clue this was going on at all.</p><p>Excitement bubbles up inside me.</p><p>We\u2019re getting married today!</p><p>I look down at my jeans and T-shirt, which has a stain on it from where JJ spit up earlier.</p><p>I\u2019m definitely not dressed to get married.</p><p>I don\u2019t even know if I\u2019ve got a dress with me that I could get married in. I start doing a quick mental run-through of the things I brought with me.</p><p>Nope, definitely nothing wedding-worthy.</p><p>\u201cJake, I love all of this, and I so want to marry you right now.\u201d My lips turn down at the corners. \u201cBut I\u2019m not exactly dressed to get married, and I don\u2019t have anything I could wear. I could go to the shops in Manchester and pick up a dress real quick, I suppose, but then\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTru, stop talking.\u201d He presses his fingers over my lips. \u201cDo you really think I would bring you here and expect you to get married in jeans?\u201d He lets out a soft laugh as he tilts his head back, looking to the left, past the altar. I follow his gaze, but I can\u2019t see anything beyond the trees.</p><p>\u201cThrough those trees, we\u2019ve set up a place for you to get ready. Everything you\u2019ll need is in there, including Simone, who\u2019s waiting for you. And when you\u2019re ready\u201d\u2014he looks back at me and caresses my cheek with his hand\u2014\u201cI\u2019ll be out here, waiting at the altar for you. Your mum and dad are on their way with JJ. Stuart, Ben, and Dave are already here. Tom, Den, Josh, Smith, Carly, my mom, Dale, and Vicky are all arriving soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVicky\u2019s coming?\u201d I beam. I haven\u2019t seen her in so long. Jake told me that she came while I was unconscious in the hospital, and we\u2019ve Skyped since I woke up, but it\u2019s not the same as seeing her in person.</p><p>\u201cShe is.\u201d</p><p>I press my face into his hand. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you did all of this under the radar. How did I not know about all of this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy. You\u2019re nosey as hell.\u201d He rests the tip of his nose against mine. \u201cBut I wanted this to be a surprise, and I wanted our wedding private. No press. Just you, me, JJ, and the people we love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I love you. Now go and get your hot ass ready so I can marry it,\u201d he says, giving my behind a gentle slap.</p><p>He kisses my lips once, then steers me off in the direction of where Simone is.</p><p>I walk past the altar, through the trees. In a clearing is a tall camping tent, the kind you can stand up in and fit a small family to sleep. It\u2019s white. Perfect for a wedding.</p><p>The door on it is tied open, and I can see Simone inside, sitting on a stool as she tinkers on her phone, by a table filled with what looks to be makeup.</p><p>She looks up, and when she sees me, a huge smile appears on her face. She puts her phone down and comes out to meet me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re getting married!\u201d she sings.</p><p>\u201cApparently so,\u201d I say with a grin. \u201cHow long have you know about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little while.\u201d She grins sheepishly. \u201cFrom the minute I moved to LA, Jake\u2019s had me shopping for everything you need. He even asked me to pick out a wedding dress for you.\u201d</p><p>I can tell from her face that Jake\u2019s asking her meant a lot. It means a lot to me too.</p><p>\u201cYou pick something good for me?\u201d I tease, poking her in the ribs.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d She gives me a look of mock-offence. \u201cI snuck a look at the dresses you\u2019d highlighted in your wedding magazines that Jake gave me, and I bought the three that had hearts next to them. I know what a geek you are. You only heart things when you really love them. You\u2019ve been doing it for years in our Next catalogue, so I figured I couldn\u2019t go wrong.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t even know she knew I did that. I hadn\u2019t really registered it as a thing I do.</p><p>\u201cVery sneaky. I\u2019m impressed.\u201d I grin at her.</p><p>She gives a little curtsy. \u201cI have everything in here you\u2019ll need\u2014wedding dresses, of course, shoes, veils, tiaras, makeup...underwear.\u201d She winks. \u201cIt\u2019s like your very own personal bridal shop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a tent.\u201d</p><p>She meets my eyes and laughs.</p><p>\u201cI love it, really,\u201d I say, wrapping my arm around her waist. I give her a gentle squeeze.</p><p>I peer inside the tent, and I can see she really has thought of everything, and it\u2019s all laid out for me. I spy a pale pink dress amidst the flashes of white hanging on a rail. It causes excitement to ripple in my stomach.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still going to be my bridesmaid, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, already got my dress.\u201d She nudges me with her hip, grinning.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, then.\u201d She links her arm through mine. \u201cLet\u2019s get you ready to become Mrs. Wethers.\u201d</p><p>I look at my reflection in the mirror. I\u2019m ready to marry the man I love. But then, I\u2019ve been ready to marry Jake for a very long time.</p><p>Simone got me ready. She did my makeup, keeping it natural, with soft pink on my eyes, mascara, and gloss on my lips. She left my hair down. Thankfully it was already clean and curly, so she pinned some tiny diamante flowers in, pulling a few strands back from off my face.</p><p>For jewellery, I\u2019m wearing my Tiffany locket and earrings, my charm bracelet, my beautiful engagement ring, of course. But most importantly, I\u2019m wearing my friendship bracelet.</p><p>But the prizewinner is the dress.</p><p>I knew right away out of the three which one I was wearing. It was the one I had been leaning toward all along when I was looking at wedding dresses.</p><p>It\u2019s a Jenny Packham gown, white and floaty, with a deep V-neck and crystal beading decorating the waist and shoulder and framing the open back. It\u2019s beautiful and the perfect dress to become Mrs. Jake Wethers in.</p><p>I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m getting married today, here at Lumb Falls. It\u2019s so surreal that I have to keep pinching myself. It\u2019s so incredibly perfect. I can\u2019t believe I didn\u2019t think of getting married here myself.</p><p>Then Jake is always one step ahead of me, and everyone else. That\u2019s what makes him...him.</p><p>\u201cHey, baby girl.\u201d</p><p>I turn at the sound of my dad\u2019s voice. The voice that can always bring a smile to my lips no matter what\u2014not that I need any help today. \u201cHey, Daddy.\u201d I smile, turning.</p><p>\u201cYou look...\u201d He takes a step toward me, arms out. \u201cYou look beautiful, Tru.\u201d I can see the pride swelling up his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou look real handsome, Daddy.\u201d I take a step closer to him and brush a piece of lint off his jacket. He\u2019s wearing a dark grey suit, white shirt, and pale pink tie.</p><p>\u201cIs Mama still crying?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d He smiles.</p><p>Mama came in to see me while I was getting ready, and she kept bursting into tears. Happy tears thankfully. Since the accident, Mama seems to have changed her whole attitude toward Jake. They\u2019ve bonded on some level. And she\u2019s completely besotted with JJ, of course, which helps.</p><p>\u201cYou ready to go out there and get married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am. Just let me get my flowers.\u201d I pick up the small bouquet that Stuart brought me a short while ago. It\u2019s amazing: pale pink roses with two dark pink roses pressed together in the middle. Like they\u2019re meant to represent Jake and me.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Jake doing?\u201d I ask, turning back to him.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s good. Surprisingly calm for a man about to get married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd JJ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCurrently asleep on Jake\u2019s shoulder.\u201d</p><p>I let out a laugh. \u201cKnowing JJ, he\u2019ll probably sleep through the entire wedding. Not that he\u2019d remember it if he was awake.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll just have to make sure to take plenty of photos for him to look at when he\u2019s older.\u201d</p><p>I lean over and kiss his cheek.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that for? Not that your old man is complaining about getting a kiss from his baby girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust to say thank you...for everything, Daddy.\u201d</p> <p>He stares into my eyes for a long moment. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to thank me for anything. You were the best kid a dad could ask for. Really, I\u2019m the one who has everything to be thankful for, to have you standing here before me now.\u201d A sob catches in his throat, and he presses his fist to his mouth.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you go crying on me.\u201d I wrap my hand over his. \u201cYou\u2019ll set me off, and Simone will go mental if I spoil my makeup.\u201d</p><p>He gives me a gentle nod and lowers his hand from his mouth.</p><p>I wrap my arms around him, hugging him.</p><p>\u201cYou know how much I love you?\u201d he says into my hair.</p> <p>\u201cI do, Daddy. And I love you the same right back.\u201d</p><p>He leans back from me, hands resting on my shoulders. \u201cI always knew one day I\u2019d be walking you down the aisle, and that Jake would be the one standing there waiting to marry you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did?\u201d I swallow past the tears creeping in.</p><p>He nods. \u201cThe way he always looked at you, and you him...it was inevitable.\u201d He smiles. \u201cCome on.\u201d He holds his arm out for me to take. \u201cTime for me to give my girl away.\u201d</p><p>I slip my arm through, curling my fingers around him, holding on to the material of his jacket.</p><p>We make our way out of the tent, and Simone is there waiting to take her place behind me.</p> <p>The dusk is creeping into night, but our walk is lit with lanterns.</p><p>Simone straightens my dress out from behind. \u201cReady?\u201d she asks.</p><p>I glance back at her, and then to my dad. \u201cFor the last twenty-four years.\u201d I smile.</p><p>Dad puts his hand over mine on his arm, and we start the short walk to Jake.</p><p>As we make our way through the trees, I hear \u201cYou Started\u201d begin to lilt softly into the air.</p><p>We step out of the trees into the clearing. I feel Jake\u2019s eyes on me immediately, but I don\u2019t look at him.</p><p>I want to wait until I reach the start of the aisle, because I want a full, unrestricted view of him. This image of how he looks right now will be etched into my mind forever, and I want it to be perfect.</p><p>Daddy walks me until we\u2019re ready to begin our walk down the aisle. Then I lift my eyes to Jake.</p> <p>He looks as beautiful as I knew he would.</p><p>He\u2019s wearing a dark grey suit exactly like my dad\u2019s, except that Jake\u2019s tie is dark pink, just like the two roses in the middle of my bouquet.</p><p>Then the world melts away, and there\u2019s only him. There has only ever been him.</p><p>With the way he\u2019s looking at me right now, I can see in his beautiful eyes that he feels exactly the same.</p><p>My dad gives my hand a gentle squeeze and starts to walk me up the aisle toward Jake, and I don\u2019t for one moment take my eyes from his.</p><p>\u201cYou look breathtaking,\u201d Jake says when I reach him.</p><p>\u201cSo do you.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t take my eyes off him. I\u2019m mesmerised.</p><p>Jake moves his eyes from mine to my dad\u2019s. \u201cThanks, Billy,\u201d he says.</p><p>I kiss my dad on the cheek before slipping my arm from his, and take Jake\u2019s hand.</p><p>Dad leans into Jake and says something into his ear. Jake looks him in the eye and nods. My dad pats him on the back, and then heads to my mum, who has a still-sleeping JJ in her arms.</p><p>She smiles proudly at me and mouths, You look beautiful.</p><p>I smile back and whisper, \u201cSo do you.\u201d</p><p>I look to Jake, and I\u2019m about to ask what my dad just said to him, when the music quiets and the registrar begins to speak.</p><p>\u201cI welcome you all here today for the wedding of Jacob David Wethers and Trudy Consuela Bennett...\u201d</p><p>I listen as the registrar speaks, my eyes fixed to Jake\u2019s, his to mine, neither of us wanting to look away from each other.</p><p>\u201cI believe Jake has something he wishes to say to Trudy before we do the official vows. The floor is all yours,\u201d the registrar says with a smile to Jake.</p><p>My face prickles, my cheeks colouring in anticipation of what he\u2019s going to say.</p><p>Jake clears his throat, running his finger into his shirt collar. He\u2019s nervous. This man can stand up on a stage and sing his heart out in front of a hundred thousand people, but here, before me, he\u2019s nervous. I love that.</p><p>He steps closer to me. \u201cDo you remember what I said that first night we moved into our house? What you asked me to say as my vows?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>\u201cIt still stands, Tru. It will always stand. My love for you is limitless, it knows no bounds. You\u2019re in my veins. I bleed you. I belong to you...I always have and I always will.\u201d He takes a deep breath. \u201cYou will always be my June, Tru.\u201d</p><p>My mind instantly goes back to that poignant moment Jake and I had, the one that defined us, the one that told me of the depth of Jake\u2019s feelings for me, how he\u2019d always seen me.</p><p>\u201cReznor\u2019s version or Johnny Cash\u2019s?\u201d I asked quietly, trying to conceal the pain from my voice.</p><p>\u201cJohnny Cash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes briefly. \u201cBecause I have a few things in common with him,\u201d he answered, opening his eyes.</p><p>\u201cLike?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe drugs...the women...hanging out for the girl of my dreams.\u201d</p><p>I took a sharp breath in. Tears instantly pricked the backs of my eyes.</p><p>He touched my face, his thumb smoothing over my lips. \u201cYou\u2019re my June, Tru.\u201d</p><p>With tears filling my eyes, I say to him for the first time, \u201cAnd you\u2019re my Johnny Cash, Jake.\u201d</p><p>Jake smiles widely, and then I can\u2019t help myself. I throw my arms around his neck and kiss him deeply.</p><p>In this moment, it\u2019s just Jake and me.</p><p>When we break away, breathless, I can see the fire in Jake\u2019s eyes, and I know where his mind is at right now...because mine\u2019s there too.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d the registrar says, clearing his throat. \u201cTime to say your vows to each other. Jake, if you could present the rings.\u201d</p><p>Jake reaches inside his jacket and pulls out two wedding bands.</p><p>The smaller one is platinum and encrusted with three pink diamonds to match my engagement ring. Jake\u2019s is matching platinum, encrusted with three sapphires.</p><p>Taking his ring from his hand, I ask, \u201cWhy sapphires?\u201d</p><p>He pushes his lips together. \u201cBlue. It\u2019s more manly than pink, baby.\u201d</p><p>He raises his brows, and I laugh.</p><p>Then I watch, holding my breath, as Jake recites his vows, gently sliding the ring onto my finger, making me his wife.</p><p>Then I do the same for him, my hand and voice trembling the whole time.</p><p>\u201cI now pronounce you husband and wife. You may kiss your bride\u2014again.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019re finally here. It\u2019s taken us a long time, a lot of hard times and work, but we\u2019ve made it. And it was worth every single moment.</p><p>My heart is full of happiness as Jake takes my face in his hands and presses his lips to mine, giving me the most breath-stealing kiss he\u2019s ever given me.</p><p>My first kiss as his wife.</p><p>\u201cFinally mine, Mrs. Wethers,\u201d he whispers over my lips.</p><p>I stare straight into his blue eyes, the eyes I will spend the rest of my life staring into. \u201cI\u2019ve always been yours, Jake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you have.\u201d He smiles, and kisses me again.</p><p>EPILOGUE</p><p>Adele starts to ring in my huge bag. I dig around for it.</p><p>Bloody hell, I have way too much stuff in this bag. I pull some nappies and wipes out and set them on the table, then my makeup bag, one of JJ\u2019s rattles, and a juice cup. I finally find my phone as Adele tells me she\u2019s \u201cRolling in the Deep,\u201d and I connect the call.</p><p>\u201cYou took your time answering.\u201d Jake\u2019s voice comes down the line.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re calling me? You\u2019re in the next suite, you lazy ass!\u201d I laugh.</p><p>\u201cStop giving me grief,\u201d he says, chuckling. \u201cI was just letting you know we\u2019re ready to go down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be right there.\u201d I put my phone on the table and slip my feet into my shoes.</p><p>\u201cHey, gorgeous, come to Mama.\u201d I put my arms out to JJ. He reaches up from his sitting position on the floor and I lift him into my arms. \u201cTime to go get Uncle Stuart married,\u201d I say, heading for the door.</p><p>We\u2019re in New York at the moment for Stuart and Josh\u2019s wedding. It\u2019s one of the few states in the US that performs same-sex marriages. Jake is Stuart\u2019s best man, I\u2019m bridesmaid, and JJ is page boy.</p><p>Yep, that\u2019s right, Stuart and Josh are getting married!</p><p>Josh asked him the day after Jake\u2019s and my wedding. It was so sweet. We were having breakfast together, when Josh got down on one knee in front of everyone and asked Stuart.</p><p>Yes, I cried. So did every other woman at the table. All the men were manly, but I know they were touched, especially Jake.</p><p>It was the perfect memory to christen our new house.</p><p>Yes, you heard that right, our new house.</p><p>After the wedding, Jake drove us to Littleborough, which is a fifteen-minute drive from Lumb Falls and a thirty-minute drive from Manchester. He\u2019d bought us a house near Hollingworth Lake. When I say \u201chouse,\u201d this is Jake we\u2019re talking about. It\u2019s a seven-bedroom country estate, secure with a gated entrance. It\u2019s beautiful.</p><p>We had our wedding reception there, which Jake and Stuart had already set up. The house was decorated, courtesy of Carly.</p><p>It\u2019s a beautiful second home for us. We spent a long wedding night making use of our big new bed, making up for the time the accident took away from us. Jake had told me that he\u2019d been holding back from making love to me since I\u2019d gotten out of the hospital as he\u2019d wanted our wedding night to be special.</p><p>And he bought the new house because he wanted us to have a home in the UK as well as LA, so we could all have the best of both worlds.</p><p>Could I love that man anymore? He really is my version of perfect.</p><p>My mum and dad moved in the new house. They live there permanently, and we go over regularly, but our base is still LA.</p><p>We went on our honeymoon two days after the wedding.</p><p>Once the press found out Jake and I had gotten married in secret, things got frenzied, as expected, so going away on our honeymoon was a good way to escape the craziness that is Jake\u2019s life, and mine now.</p><p>Our honeymoon was a long one\u2014we were gone for four weeks, just Jake, JJ, and me. And, well, Dave and Ben, of course.</p><p>We changed our original honeymoon plan to go back to Turtle Island, as we didn\u2019t think the heat there and JJ would go well together, so we instead travelled to all the sights Jake and I had never seen, the ones he had waited to see with me.</p><p>We will go back to Turtle Island one day in the near future, but in the meantime Stuart and Josh are going on their honeymoon there. They don\u2019t know yet; it\u2019s our wedding gift to them.</p><p>Jake, JJ, and I went to Venice to see the canals and take a ride in a gondola. We went to Pisa to see the tower. Rome to see the Colosseum. Barcelona to see the Sagrada Familia. You name it, we visited it. It was the best trip of my life, and I will always remember it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Then we went back to LA. Jake went back to work at the label, and TMS finished their new album. The tour that was scheduled for autumn was pushed back, and they\u2019ll be going on tour at the beginning of next year. Of course we\u2019ll be going along, as is my dad. He\u2019s ridiculously excited about it.</p><p>I also went back to work. My book finally came out. The launch was moved to LA to make it easier for me, and it went great. The biography received really great early reviews, and sales went through the roof.</p><p>Everyone wants to know and have a little piece of Jake Wethers, written by the woman who knows him best.</p><p>I\u2019m fine with that, because I have the real man as a whole here with me.</p> <p>I\u2019m still working for Vicky, doing my column. The magazine is doing amazingly, thanks to Jake\u2019s book.</p><p>I know you\u2019re probably wondering why I\u2019m still working for Vicky\u2014it\u2019s not like I need to work, and I have JJ now. But I love it. I love writing and I love music, and I owe everything to Vicky. There\u2019s no way I\u2019m leaving her now, when the magazine is starting to take off.</p><p>She keeps talking about making me partner. One day, I think yes. But right now I have my hands full with JJ, and then we\u2019ll have the new baby coming too.</p><p>Oh, did I not mention that I\u2019m pregnant again? I\u2019m six months gone. We\u2019re having another boy. He\u2019s our honeymoon baby.</p><p>I\u2019m going to let Jake name him.</p> <p>Simone\u2019s pregnant too, which is awesome! Denny is like the cat that got the cream.</p><p>They got married on Christmas Eve, and it was magical. I was bridesmaid, JJ page boy\u2014we\u2019re doing that a lot recently\u2014and Jake and Tom were best men. Then Simone found out while they were on honeymoon that she was pregnant. They had gotten married while she was pregnant and she didn\u2019t even know. At least they can\u2019t be accused of a shotgun wedding.</p><p>I know you\u2019re wondering about Tom: Is he still the changed Tom of last year or is he back to the man-whoring Tom we all knew? All I\u2019ll say is Tom is happy right now. The happiest I\u2019ve ever seen him.</p><p>I open the door to Stuart\u2019s suite to find Jake and him sitting at the table, sharing a laugh, drinking whiskey.</p><p>\u201cBit early to be on the hard stuff, isn\u2019t it?\u201d I joke.</p><p>\u201cHey, go easy on me, gorgeous! It isn\u2019t every day a man gets married. I need the Dutch courage.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDada!\u201d JJ calls out, chubby arms reaching out for Jake.</p><p>\u201cHey, little man. Come here, I missed you.\u201d Jake takes him into his arms, nuzzling his black hair, while JJ\u2019s chubby little hands grab at Jake\u2019s face, causing Jake to laugh.</p><p>Jake\u2019s only been away from JJ for the morning. To say he\u2019s attached to JJ is putting it mildly, and it goes both ways: JJ adores Jake.</p><p>The love Jake has for our son wrecks my heart every single day, in the best possible way.</p><p>I love watching them together. It\u2019ll never get old. I know just how lucky I am to be here with them both. I treasure every single moment I have with them.</p><p>I turn to Stuart, resting my hand on his shoulder. \u201cYou ready to go get married?\u201d</p><p>He gets to his feet and slings his arm across my shoulder. \u201cChica, to quote the wise words of our man Jake here...abso-fuckin\u2019-lutely!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLanguage in front of JJ!\u201d Jake chastises.</p> <p>I can\u2019t help but laugh. I never thought I would hear the day Jake would tell someone off for swearing. But he does, regularly.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Stuart apologises, flashing me a \u201chere he goes again\u201d look.</p><p>\u201cI saw that,\u201d Jake mutters.</p><p>\u201cYou were meant to,\u201d Stuart replies.</p><p>They\u2019re like a pair of kids at times. And I wouldn\u2019t have them any other way.</p><p>We take the elevator down and meet Josh outside with Dan, his brother and best man.</p><p>The way Stuart and Josh look at each other just melts my heart. I\u2019m so glad Stuart found his someone. He truly deserves to be happy like Jake and I are.</p><p>Taking each other\u2019s hands, Stuart and Josh enter the room to get married where all our family and friends are waiting inside.</p><p>The Mighty Storm family, and what a family we are.</p><p>And when our kids grow up and ask about the story of Mummy and Daddy\u2014how we met and how the Mighty Storm came to be\u2014I\u2019ll sit them down and tell them the story of how, once upon a long time ago, in Manchester, a girl moved next door to a boy... </p> </body></html>"]
