Amelia Earhart lost. All-that\u2019s-missing-is-the-smoke-monster lost. The kind of lost you only got when you were running seriously late and were this close to being fired. Again.</p><p>\u201cI suppose a little visibility would be too much to ask,\u201d I muttered, rubbing my sleeve against the fogged glass of the windshield. I squinted at the faded, peeling road sign that marked the fork off Sedgemoore Road. I was pretty sure the bold block letters were painted sometime during the Lewis and Clark expedition. Did my client live so far away from civilization that the Washington highway department simply forgot his road existed? My cell phone\u2019s navigation app had certainly glossed over it. Smartphone, my ass.</p><p>I pulled the pimped-out, late-model Suburban I\u2019d dubbed the \u201cBatmobile\u201d onto the muddy shoulder and checked the map again. Sedgemoore Road had several forks. Then again, I wasn\u2019t sure I was still on Sedgemoore. Pierce County only went so far. In my vehicular meanderings through the forest, had I accidentally broken immigration laws and ventured into Canada? I checked the glowing green lights of the digital clock. I was forty minutes behind schedule. Well, yesterday\u2019s schedule. Either way, I should have had Mr. Sutherland loaded up and halfway to Tacoma by now.</p> <p>Panic surged through my chest, a hot, acidic burn that humiliated as much as it pained. How did this crap always end up happening to me? I wasn\u2019t stupid, careless, or lazy. I didn\u2019t wake up in the morning and think, You know what? Today\u2019s a good day for massive, humiliating failure.</p><p>I didn\u2019t intend to be this late in my first official pickup as a \u201ctransport specialist\u201d for Beeline, Half-Moon Hollow\u2019s only daytime vampire concierge service. I didn\u2019t intend for a depressed chicken to leap to its death from a Sunny Farms truck, splintering my windshield and requiring a daylong delay in Kansas City for repairs. I certainly didn\u2019t intend for the Batmobile\u2019s post-cross-country/pre-cross-country tune-up to take an hour longer than promised by that sketchy gas-station mechanic, putting me behind schedule and on the road after dark, where no person with ordinary human vision would be able to see through the rain, much less read Sacagawea\u2019s road signs.</p><p>Can an inner monologue hyperventilate?</p><p>I squeezed my eyes shut, breathing slowly and deliberately through my nose, just like the therapist told me ... before I stopped going ... after the second session. I focused on the sound of the rain pounding against the roof of the car. I inhaled the scent of the cheap pine air freshener that the detailers used on the upholstery, which was sort of superfluous considering my evergreen surroundings. The steering wheel was warm and smooth beneath my palms, slightly damp.</p><p>I forced myself to open my eyes. I was a Puckett, damn it. And Pucketts didn\u2019t lose our nerve. We schemed, we interjected, we occasionally drank too much and told someone what we really thought of them at a Christmas party, but we never lost our nerve. I\u2019d faced situations far more complicated than this before and emerged un-, well, relatively unscathed\u2014without lasting damage, at least. And I\u2019d laughed most of the way. There was no reason to get wound up now.</p> <p>The water rippled down the windshield, turning the Washington countryside into a murky, verdant mess. Taking another deep breath, I turned off the shoulder, pulled toward the fork, bore right, and then changed to left at the last minute.</p><p>It\u2019s a process, and occasionally, it works.</p><p>A few miles later, I saw lights through the trees. It took only three attempts for me to find the shrubbery-shrouded driveway entrance, marked with the smallest fricking address plaque in the world. The house itself was gorgeous, one of those timeless cabins of stone and cedar shake built so it looked like part of the terrain. I wanted to weep with relief as I parked the car in front of the vaultlike pine door, but showing up with big mascara tracks down one\u2019s face seemed unprofessional.</p><p>I peered up at the huge windows, inconveniently hung with white sheer curtains, so I couldn\u2019t see inside. A man who lived in the middle of nowhere ... who didn\u2019t want anyone looking in his windows. That wasn\u2019t a red flag or anything.</p><p>\u201cYou can do this, Miranda,\u201d I murmured. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to be afraid of. This is just another adventure, uncharted territory ... the kind with abandoned country roads ... and a creepy guy who needs curtains to hide his activities from his nonexistent neighbors. And that\u2019s definitely new.\u201d</p><p>Angry alt rock blared through the pitter-pattering against my windshield. My eyes flicked toward my cell phone and spotted an unwelcome number on the caller ID. I sighed and pressed \u201cignore,\u201d then silenced the ringer. It wouldn\u2019t do for Mr. Sutherland to know that my on-again, off-again fianc\u00e9\u2019s ringtone was Henry Rollins singing, \u201cI\u2019m a liar!\u201d</p> <p>I had my reasons.</p><p>I took a deep breath before hopping out of the car and dashing to the front door. The rain picked up the moment I was out, the wind sweeping in from both sides, pelting my back with sheets of water. In just a few steps, I was soaked, my feet squishing and squeaking inside my low-heeled black boots.</p><p>Of course.</p><p>Before I could knock, the door swung open. Blue eyes. Ice-blue, with only the tiniest hint of darker sapphire around the pupils. And those peepers were not happy. Yelping, I jumped back and would have fallen on my ass in the mud had not a pale hand shot out to grasp my wrist and yank me inside.</p><p>The moment I was through the door, he dropped my wrist as if the contact burned. I pulled my hand back, cradling it to my body and shrinking against the door.</p><p>Vampires were generally more attractive than the human population. Whatever they were in life, they ended up just a little bit sexier, with a dash of that \u201cdangerous to know\u201d appeal. Well, Mr. Sutherland had obviously started off with a pretty high bar. His ridiculously shiny coffee-colored hair was tousled in that intentionally messy-sexy way that begged for fingers to comb through it. The dark hair accentuated pale skin and aristocratic features, a high forehead, a straight nose, cheekbones so high that they left sharp hollows on either side of his face, and a generous mouth posed in a permanent sneer.</p><p>Given our surroundings, I\u2019d foreseen a vampire Grizzly Adams opening the door. But my new client had been turned sometime in his late thirties. He wore a dapper, almost Victorian, gray three-piece suit with a crisp white shirt, no tie. Frankly, I expected him to whip out a Phantom of the Opera cape any moment.</p><p>\u201cMr. Sutherland?\u201d I squeaked. \u201cAre you Collin Sutherland?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLate,\u201d he growled.</p><p>Mr. Sutherland loomed over me, the scent of amber and bitter orange making my mouth water. The oceanic eyes narrowed as he scanned me from head to toe. His grimace twisted in an expression of disdain. I glanced down and wondered what was wrong. I was wearing what my boss, Iris, assured me was perfectly acceptable driving attire, dark jeans and a white button-up blouse ... which was currently transparent, thanks to the rain.</p><p>He yanked me out of contemplations of long fingers and dusky, sneering lips by growling again. \u201cFeet.\u201d</p><p>I cleared my throat, because the mouselike voice emitting from my mouth was plain embarrassing. \u201cBeg pardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFeet!\u201d he hissed.</p><p>Would we be communicating in one-word sentences for the next four nights?</p><p>I looked down to see small puddles forming around my boots, right on his beautifully polished floor. I sidestepped onto an area rug, but Mr. Sutherland couldn\u2019t have glared more fiercely if I\u2019d piddled on his exquisite hardwood.</p><p>We were not off to a good start.</p><p>Iris had warned me that Mr. Sutherland was a \u201cdelicate case,\u201d but she hadn\u2019t elaborated on what that meant beyond his apparently crippling phobia of airplanes and the fact that he hadn\u2019t left his house in \u201ca long, long time.\u201d Could a chronic case of male PMS be considered \u201cdelicate\u201d?</p><p>\u201cI am really sorry for the day\u2019s delay, Mr. Sutherland,\u201d I said, my voice uncomfortably tinny. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t be avoided. There was this chicken. I think he knew his end was at hand, and I guess he didn\u2019t want to be chicken nuggets\u2014\u201d</p><p>Mr. Sutherland pivoted on his heel and disappeared into the kitchen. My lips clamped shut, and I frowned.</p><p>I was used to far more pleasant interactions with vampires. I\u2019d worked as a waitress at a vampire bar called Bite for six months. The nonbreathing clients were a lot friendlier than those with pulses, and they left better tips. And in the days after I\u2019d accepted the assignment, Iris, an old high-school classmate, had had me do a series of test runs, ferrying local vampires across town like an undead taxi. I used the first two-hour leg of this journey cross-country to drive her friend Jane from Half-Moon Hollow to Nashville for a booksellers convention. Jane had been downright sweet, keeping me entertained on the brief drive through Tennessee with her absurd life story. None of these experiences had prepared me for Mr. Sutherland\u2019s hostile, monosyllabic reception.</p><p>In his absence, I saw that the house was comfortable and quaint. The open floor plan gave visual access to nearly everything, including the spectacular view afforded by the back windows. Rough-hewn polished pine stairs led to a bedroom loft. Comfy-looking leather chairs the color of melting caramel flanked a river-stone fireplace. Bookshelves stocked with leather-bound editions stretched floor to ceiling on the opposite wall. There was no stuffy furniture, no useless dust catchers beyond a red and gold military insignia framed and displayed on the mantel. A lion devouring a snake.</p><p>A thump from above snapped me out of my decor ogling. I focused on the little pile of luggage near the foot of the stairs, and I slung a dark leather designer overnight bag onto my shoulder. When I bent to pick up a sleek silver suitcase, there was a blur of motion, the force of which swept my wet hair over my eyes. I lurched to my feet, pulling the damp strands out of my face, just in time to find Mr. Sutherland snatching the case out of my hands.</p><p>\u201cYou do not touch this case,\u201d he said sternly, shoving a pristine white towel into my hands. He swept across the room to blot my puddle from the floor with a clean cloth. \u201cI am responsible for transporting this case to Ophelia Lambert at midnight four nights from now\u2014a deadline that your tardiness has put in jeopardy, I might add. Therefore, only I touch the case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly I touch the case,\u201d he said.</p><p>I was starting to suspect that he had unnatural feelings for that case.</p><p>I raised an eyebrow. \u201cAre you going to be handcuffing it to your arm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery amusing, Miss Puckett,\u201d he said, looking me up and down. \u201cOf course, I\u2019m forced to assume that you are the Miss Puckett described in Miss Scanlon\u2019s correspondence, since you have not, in fact, introduced yourself to me.\u201d</p><p>Something about the way his silky voice slid over my skin triggered my \u201cauthority figure\u201d complex. And suddenly, I was having some very unwelcome, very naughty images of Mr. Sutherland and his hypothetical handcuffs.</p><p>\u201cOh, right, sorry. Hi, I\u2019m Miranda Puckett. I\u2019m the driver for Beeline.\u201d I reached out my hand to shake, a hand that he pointedly ignored as he swept past me.</p><p>Shocked by his rudeness, I merely followed in his wake, muttering to myself. \u201cNice to meet you, too. Oh, yes, I\u2019m sure we\u2019re going to end up lifelong friends after this road trip. We\u2019re off to such a great start. Feel like I\u2019ve known you my whole life,\u201d I grumbled, toting the bags to the car while he checked and rechecked the locks on his front door. \u201cAnd I\u2019m talking to myself again. Super.\u201d</p><p>I stared at the warm, dry house with longing. A kinder client might have offered me use of the restroom or even coffee. But I was hardly in a position to ask for perks.</p><p>To add insult to injury, my tardiness and the weather ruined my plans to introduce Mr. Sutherland to the fabulous features of the Batmobile, which I\u2019d thoroughly rehearsed with a very patient Jane. A decommissioned Council vehicle that Iris had purchased for a song at auction, the Batmobile was built for comfort and safety. While it looked like a mild-mannered SUV from the outside, the Batmobile boasted a light-tight cubby that took up most of the rear compartment\u2019s floorboard, like a compact coffin, allowing the passenger to ride comfortably while I drove us in full sun. Tucked between the front seats sat a cunning little cooler/warmer for blood. It worked a bit like a bottle steamer, using hot water on a timed switch to bring the blood to an even 98.6. The windows were tinted with SPF 500 film so that he would be safe inside the cab if necessary. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019d become familiar with those features on the three- (OK, four-) day drive to pick up Mr. Sutherland. I\u2019d planned to make him familiar with them before we started the drive back to Half-Moon Hollow so he could deliver a parcel to an official with the World Council for the Equal Treatment of the Undead. But clearly, Mr. Sutherland preferred that we just get on the road. I couldn\u2019t blame him, I supposed. We absolutely, positively had to be back on time, or Mr. Sutherland would not be paid ... which meant that Iris would not be paid ... which meant that I would not be paid ... which would be upsetting.</p><p>Using the boatload of upper-body strength it took to close the rear door, I slammed it down. I noticed a pale flash out of the corner of my eye at the last minute. The gate came crashing down on Mr. Sutherland\u2019s fingers with a sickening crunch.</p><p>This was a hallucination. I could not be looking at a vampire\u2019s hand caught in a car door, crushed like something out of an Itchy and Scratchy cartoon. I clapped my hands over my mouth and let out a horrified shriek.</p> <p>\u201cOpen the bloody gate!\u201d he roared.</p><p>I scrambled for the key fob and clicked it, popping the door open. Mr. Sutherland groaned and flexed his mangled fingers, bent at bizarre angles, obviously broken in several places. Sure, they would fix themselves rapidly with his vampire healing, but it would hurt like a bitch.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry!\u201d I cried, rushing forward to help him. He hissed like a cat and turned his back on me. \u201cShit! I\u2019m so sorry!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLanguage, Miss Puckett,\u201d he growled over his shoulder. \u201cDid you not see that my hand was in the way?\u201d He grunted as his fingers stretched and snapped back into their proper places.</p><p>\u201cNot until the last minute,\u201d I said. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you move your hand when you saw I was closing the door?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI thought you would stop the door,\u201d he shot back.</p><p>\u201cHow was I supposed to do that? I don\u2019t have vampire reflexes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom now on, I will keep your limitations in mind,\u201d he seethed, and pivoted on his heel toward the car door.</p><p>Mr. Sutherland was already seated in the middle of the backseat when, shaking my wet hair out of my face, I slid into the driver\u2019s seat. He flexed his reformed fingers and glared at me. The case was tucked safely by his feet on the floor boards, as if he was afraid to lose contact with it for even a moment.</p><p>What the hell was in the case? I wondered. Huge stacks of cash? Jewels? What if it was nuclear codes or radioactive materials? Iris seemed like a nice lady. I would hope she wouldn\u2019t involve me in international espionage on my first cross-country job. Maybe the second or third but certainly not the first.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to sit in the back?\u201d I asked, glancing at him in the rearview.</p> <p>He looked me over again, that same pinched, confused expression he\u2019d given me before. I couldn\u2019t blame him. I had just destroyed his right hand. And he seemed to spend an awful lot of time alone ...</p><p>Catching my reflection in the mirror, I cringed. No wonder Mr. Sutherland seemed so ... well, unimpressed would be putting it kindly. My heart-shaped face held few charms beyond a pert little nose and a frame of light brown hair that frizzed in humidity and hung limp in every other sort of -idity. I had a weird, top-heavy mouth that made me look as if I\u2019d been thoroughly kissed, which generally wasn\u2019t the case. I\u2019d inherited my dad\u2019s Puckett green eyes, with little flecks of gold around the pupils and a heavy fringe of lashes. Other than that, I was painfully average, which was strange, because I managed to gum up my life in such spectacular ways.</p><p>Given my underwhelming attractions, I supposed that at this point, I should have been grateful that Mr. Sutherland wasn\u2019t making me wear one of those little chauffeur caps to hide my face.</p><p>It was just as well that he seemed to think I was some sort of disheveled swamp troll. As tempting as Mr. Sutherland was, dreamy insouciance and angular GQ looks were not my thing. Until I\u2019d met Jason, my boyfriends had borne a disturbing resemblance to Criss Angel.</p><p>I had just started the engine when my phone buzzed from the console. Speak of the Polo-wearing, microbrew-swilling devil. It was probably another ass-dial. Jason didn\u2019t like to bother with his screen lock on his phone, so he disabled it, which meant that he was sort of notorious for calling people whenever he sat down. Of the dozens of calls he\u2019d made to my phone over the last few days, he was only aware of half of them.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t ready to talk to him or his ass cheeks. And I could only be grateful that I\u2019d turned off the Henry Rollins ringtone before Mr. Sutherland could hear it. I reached for the \u201cignore\u201d button, only to suffer that velvet vampire voice\u2019s further abuse of my goose-bump response.</p><p>\u201cMiss Puckett, I faxed a document concerning my transportation requirements to your employer upon the signing of our contract. Did you not read it?\u201d</p><p>Sadly, I had read what amounted to a sixteen-page contract rider, which outlined everything from maximum speeds at which I was allowed to change lanes to fragrances I was allowed to wear to which foods I was allowed to eat in his presence. I thought it was a joke. Clearly, I was wrong.</p> <p>He cleared his throat pointedly and handed me an extra copy, triple-stapled, along with the credit card I was supposed to be using for our travel expenses. \u201cIf you read page ten, you\u2019ll see that phone use or texting while driving is strictly prohibited.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, I wasn\u2019t going to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo excuses, Miss Puckett,\u201d he said in that clipped, vaguely accented voice.</p><p>I gritted my teeth, my voice practically whistling through them as I said, \u201cYou know, this whole thing might feel a little less awkward if you called me Miranda.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK, then,\u201d I ground out, \u201cdo you have a music preference?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPage twelve, Miss Puckett.\u201d</p><p>I flipped through the booklet listing tolerable music selections. I sighed and tuned the radio to a classical station. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a long drive.\u201d</p><p>MORE ISSUES THAN NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC</p><p>2</p><p>We did not manage to become bosom companions in those first few hours on the road. Mr. Sutherland sat in the backseat, silent and taciturn, alternately glaring out the window and checking our progress against an atlas. Did he give me information from the atlas while I struggled to find our way back to civilization? No, he just grimaced every time I made a turn, which was super-helpful.</p><p>The plan for this excursion to Half-Moon Hollow, Kentucky, was that I would drive as far as I could each day and well past sunset, letting Mr. Sutherland sleep during the day in the little car cubby. We would pull over at carefully chosen roadside motels at a \u201creasonable stopping time\u201d so I could eat and rest. Mr. Sutherland didn\u2019t have a driver\u2019s license, so he would not help out with the wheel time.</p><p>As I said, that was the plan. But, as in most cases where I was involved, that plan went awry. Terribly, terribly awry. Thanks to our late start and my accidentally looping around Tacoma twice, we reached a motel at 2 A.M. It could not come soon enough. After nearly twenty-eight hours without sleep, I was getting a little punchy. Falling asleep at the wheel and killing myself would be a really bad way to finish up my maiden voyage.</p><p>We had not reached the vicinity of the approved first-night motel choices. We weren\u2019t within fifty miles of those choices. There was not a Ramada or a Holiday Inn in sight. Now, the one-story, nondescript-beyond-the-dripping-rust-stains-on-the-exterior-walls Pine Heights Motel? That we had.</p><p>I pulled the car to a stop and jumped out without a word to Mr. Sutherland. I didn\u2019t feel obligated, since he hadn\u2019t spared one for me since we\u2019d pulled out of his driveway. I walked into the office to book two rooms, studiously ignoring the fact that the rooms were only thirty-two dollars per night and that the clerk gave me keys\u2014real, old-fashioned, metal keys on honest-to-goodness plastic tags. Also, his emphasis on the \u201cpay-perv-view\u201d channels as an amenity really creeped me out.</p><p>When I emerged from the office, feeling significantly less confident in the accommodations than when I\u2019d walked in, Mr. Sutherland was leaning against the car, glowering at any object that crossed his field of vision.</p><p>\u201cThis motel, if you can even call it that, is unacceptable. Miss Puckett, if you will review the preapproved itinerary\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did read it, all sixteen pages,\u201d I told him. \u201cAnd unfortunately, we weren\u2019t able to make it as far as planned\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnacceptable!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhether you accept it or not, that\u2019s the way it is!\u201d I shouted back.</p><p>Mr. Sutherland squinted at me again, which was either his idea of intimidation or he had some strange facial tic when he was angry. He snatched the key from my hand. \u201cAnd my credit card, if you please. I don\u2019t believe I can trust you with purchasing decisions.\u201d</p><p>I slapped the card into his outstretched palm, then yanked the rear door open and dropped his overnight bag at his feet. Counting down from ten, I cleared my throat, hoping that I sounded the least bit contrite. \u201cLook, we are on the road. Traveling is unpredictable. There will be contingencies. You are just going to have to accept that the days will not go completely according to plan.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Sutherland smiled nastily. \u201cI\u2019ll be sure to tell your supervisor you said so.\u201d He spun in the direction of his room, without a glance back at me. \u201cGood night, Miss Puckett.\u201d</p><p>I pressed the heel of my hand against my sternum, hoping to quell the tension building there as he walked away. Mr. Sutherland slipped the key into the door to 6C, pointedly ignoring my presence. I glared at his back, praying that I could keep my mouth shut and get my ass into my room before I chucked a loose cement block at his head. Calm, I told myself. Stay cool. Do not concuss the client.</p><p>And then I remembered the disdainful little sneer he\u2019d given me when my shoes dripped on his precious floor. And the snotty way he\u2019d informed me that I wasn\u2019t responsible enough to be trusted with his credit card. No, he was not going to get away with talking to me that way. I would not put up with that bullshit for three more nights.</p><p>\u201cYou know what, you are a real piece of work.\u201d</p><p>He turned to give me an incredulous look.</p><p>I cleared my throat and tried for a more respectful tone. Not because I was working for him but because, you know, he had fangs. \u201cIf you feel the need to contact Ms. Scanlon, I don\u2019t suppose there\u2019s anything I can do to stop you.\u201d He smirked slightly, before I added, \u201cBut if you plan to call now, I think you should consider how you\u2019re going to get home.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t offer me another glance as he slammed his room door shut.</p><p>I opened my door and shut it behind me, whacking my head against the state room-tax notice. A familiar rise of panic burned my throat at the idea of returning home early, of seeing Jason before I was ready. But if Mr. Sutherland was going to tattle on me, there wasn\u2019t anything I could do to stop him, so I might as well get a good night\u2019s sleep. Sighing, I dropped my bag onto the bed and scanned the dismal little room. It was too dirty to be considered Spartan, too outdated to be considered retro. The carpet may have been a sort of burnt orange at some point, but it was now more of a knotty brownish gray. The bedspread was the same paper-thin synthetic fiber used in all cheap motels. I had no doubt that long after the nuclear winter, future civilizations would visit our planet and find scratchy motel bedspreads flapping across the earth\u2019s wasted landscape. I made a mental note to toss that particular specimen to the floor and avoid touching it for the remainder of my stay. I was not sleeping on that thing.</p><p>I checked my phone again, finding that Jason was down two calls to my mother, who had called a total of ten times that day. Pulling my phone out of my pocket, I calculated the time difference. It was 5:30 A.M. in Kentucky, which meant Mom would be up and on her treadmill already\u2014just another way in which I wasn\u2019t living up to her high standards. She picked up on the first ring. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSweetheart!\u201d she cried. \u201cWhy haven\u2019t you called?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019ve been calling enough for the both of us?\u201d I suggested dryly.</p><p>\u201cWell, I just wanted to know that you\u2019d arrived safely.\u201d She was using the unreasonable client-quelling voice that she used as one Puckett in the firm of Puckett and Puckett, Attorneys at Law. This was not a good sign.</p> <p>Mom, my father, and my brother, Glenn, practiced in the long-held family firm, their shiny law degrees from the University of Kentucky displayed together in a three-part frame. There was supposed to be a fourth frame, but I hadn\u2019t finished the requirements for a bachelor\u2019s degree, much less law school.</p><p>I rubbed at my left eye, which tended to twitch when Mom used \u201cthe voice\u201d on me. \u201cWhich was why I texted you as soon as I arrived in Tacoma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she protested. \u201cBut I want to know how it\u2019s going!\u201d</p><p>Now, most people would consider that the sweet, interested curiosity of an involved parent. But my mother had ulterior motives. Mom didn\u2019t want me to tell her how well I was doing or what Mr. Sutherland was like. She wanted to know if I was tanking ahead of schedule, forcing me to \u201ccome to my senses\u201d and drive my butt back to Half-Moon Hollow, where I was safe and contained.</p><p>As much as her assumptions of disaster hurt, I supposed she had good reason. At the tender age of twenty-six, I\u2019d launched failed careers as, among many other things, a photographer, a pastry chef, a magician\u2019s assistant, and a florist. Mom and I suffered from an opposition of life philosophies. I tried to think of life as the search for the next great adventure. I liked waking up each morning not knowing what I would be doing by the end of the day. I liked learning new things, throwing myself into new situations, even if it meant a few bumps and scrapes along the way. But ultimately, I was a guidance counselor\u2019s cautionary tale. Mom blamed the public-school system and insisted that the family should have sent me to St. Bridget\u2019s Academy across town, even if it meant having to convert.</p> <p>We were about as old money as a family could get in Half-Moon Hollow. Pucketts were pillars of the community. We served on committees and councils. We funded buildings and restored memorial statues. We sponsored youth sports teams and hosted Labor Day picnics for state senators.</p><p>Well, that\u2019s what my family did. I served the community in more of a \u201cjudge ordered me to\u201d sort of way. Until the previous year, I\u2019d been the family embarrassment, the college dropout, the kid who never quite made it into the Christmas newsletter. My shameful status was temporarily revoked when\u2014</p><p>\u201cHave you called Jason?\u201d Mom asked.</p><p>\u2014when I agreed to marry Jason.</p><p>I let out a long, slow breath. \u201cNo. The point of me taking this trip is that I have space and don\u2019t have to talk to Jason, so I can figure out what I want.\u201d</p><p>Mom sniffed. \u201cWell, he\u2019s worried. I know you\u2019re upset with him, but he\u2019s worried about you. He asked me to pass that along.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHmph.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really think you should just come on home. I know you\u2019re hurt, honey, and I\u2019m not saying you don\u2019t have good reason. But you can\u2019t run away from your problems. I\u2019m so worried about you, out there on your own. And how are you supposed to do ... whatever it is that you\u2019re going to do concerning Jason unless you talk it out?\u201d</p><p>I tugged at Jason\u2019s tasteful diamond engagement ring, hanging from a sturdy chain around my neck. \u201cWe did talk it out, Mom. We have spent hours talking around and around this Lisa thing. We spent a whole weekend getaway at the lake talking about it. I canceled the wedding. I keep giving his ring back, but he finds some way to slip it to me again. We\u2019re never going to break out of this weird, pointless cycle unless I have time to figure out what I want, without him hovering over me with apology flowers, apology candy, apology jelly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApology jelly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I didn\u2019t get that one, either,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t think this temp job\u201d\u2014Mom said the words with as much contempt as good manners and the Botox injections that kept her from expressing the full range of human emotions permitted\u2014\u201cis the answer to your problems. And besides, we miss you around the office. It\u2019s just not the same without you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet.\u201d I chuckled, genuinely laughing for the first time all day.</p><p>Despite the fact that I lacked only two credits for my certification, I was a terrible paralegal. Filing systems made my head hurt. I could not handle rude clients in the delicate, pacifying manner prescribed by firm policy. And every time I used the Xerox machine, I posed a danger to myself and others.</p> <p>But since the spectacular failure of my photography studio in Chicago, I\u2019d been training under the aging Mrs. Whitaker to take her place as the primary support staffer at Puckett and Puckett. My parents were well aware that I wasn\u2019t an asset to their office. But they wanted to know that I was safe, that I was taken care of. And ultimately, I think that was why they liked the idea of my marrying Jason. He was safe. He would be a good provider. And he would probably keep me from setting fires with most household appliances.</p><p>\u201cMom, everything\u2019s fine here. I\u2019m enjoying my time on the road.\u201d I sighed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to disappoint you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sweetheart, how could you say that? You know I\u2019m only worried about you. I would think that you would want to come home, just so I would know you were safe. I just want you to be happy.\u201d</p><p>As long as it was her preferred brand of happiness.</p><p>\u201cI like this temp job, Mom. It was really nice of Iris to hook me up with this assignment. She knew I wanted to get out of town to clear my head, and she helped me out. And believe it or not, I\u2019m actually qualified for the work. I\u2019ve moved almost a dozen times over the last eight years. I have a lot of experience driving back and forth across the country,\u201d I said, taking the phone away from my ear long enough to pull a White Stripes T-shirt over my head. \u201cAnd the one thing that you can say proudly is that I have a pristine driving record.\u201d</p><p>My close encounter with the despondent chicken was on a need-to-know basis. Mom didn\u2019t need to know.</p><p>\u201cWell, it seems a very silly way to make a living.\u201d She sniffed. \u201cThen again, if it lasts as long as the other jobs, I won\u2019t have much to worry about.\u201d</p><p>And there went the eye again.</p><p>A half hour and many \u201cI just want what\u2019s best for you\u2019s\u201d later, my self-esteem was properly checked. Mom had given me the up-to-the-minute news on my family. Jason had successfully defended one of Daddy\u2019s best friends from tax-evasion charges. Daddy shot a seventy at the Half-Moon Hollow Country Club and Catfish Farm, a new personal best. Glenn had just broken a record for highest-ever settlement against a grocery store in Kentucky. The management at the Shop-N-Go in Murphy hadn\u2019t properly shelved bottles of dish soap, resulting in back pain and suffering for someone not smart enough to step around a puddle of it. My sister-in-law, Courtney Herndon-Puckett, had decided to open a brick-and-mortar store for her start-up cosmetics business.</p><p>OK, that one caught me off-guard.</p><p>\u201cDoes the world really need an outlet for repackaged Mary Kay products?\u201d I asked, slipping into well-worn jeans and orange Chucks.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t mention Mary Kay in front of Courtney. You know that upsets her.\u201d</p><p>Courtney wanted to teach me how to apply makeup that didn\u2019t make me look like \u201ca sad-clown hooker,\u201d film it, and post it on YouTube to promote her business. I wasn\u2019t really worried about Courtney\u2019s feelings.</p><p>I managed to wind down the conversation halfway through the semicondensed version of who from church was having surgery/a baby/surgery to help them \u201ctighten up\u201d by saying, \u201cSorry, Mom, my boss is calling on the other line,\u201d and hanging up quickly. Was there a call from Iris? No. But it was more mature than what I used to tell her to cut calls short: \u201cSorry, Mom, a pigeon just spontaneously combusted on my windowsill.\u201d That only worked when I was living in a city, anyway.</p><p>Palming my keys, I took a deep breath as I wandered out into the cool early-autumn night. Talking to my mother always left me feeling hollowed out, as if someone had taken an overpriced melon baller from Williams-Sonoma and scraped away perfectly spherical chunks of my resolve. Picturing a giant fruit salad composed of my emotions probably meant that I needed food desperately, or I would never get enough sleep to qualify as human in the morning. The Waffle Shoppe sign blinking across the parking lot put me in the mood for French toast.</p><p>Hold the melon.</p><p>The Waffle Shoppe did not disappoint. It had all of the charm and atmosphere you\u2019d expect for a place that sold all-you-can-eat pancakes for $3.95. The Formica table was peeling, and three-quarters of the menu pages were stuck together with some mercifully unidentifiable mystery substance. But the coffee was hot, and the patrons were quiet. If I\u2019d had my camera, I would have taken quiet, quick face shots, character studies. People were way more interesting to shoot while they were concentrating on their food, but you had to be careful, because in some establishments, the management took that personally ... or they suspected that you were a narc.</p><p>I struck up a friendly conversation with Nina, my waitress, which, according to the truck-stop code, meant that my food wouldn\u2019t be spit in intentionally before it arrived at my table. I consider that a quality dining experience.</p><p>After a delicious breakfast/dinner of apple cinnamon French toast and hash browns, I wandered into the motel parking lot, carbo-loaded and ready for bed. I had a long day of appeasing the ninety-year-old woman trapped in a vampire\u2019s body ahead of me, and that would require sleep.</p><p>Shuffling across the lot, I plucked nervously at the engagement ring I wore around my neck. I hadn\u2019t wanted to hold on to the ring at first. The moment I\u2019d found out about Jason and Lisa, I\u2019d taken it off and hurled it across the room, vowing never to touch it again. And I wouldn\u2019t have, if the damn thing hadn\u2019t gotten caught in my vacuum cleaner and destroyed it ... the vacuum cleaner, I mean. The ring was fine. Damn it.</p><p>I\u2019d seriously considered putting it through a wood chipper and sending him the fragments. But considering that it had survived the innards of my vacuum cleaner unscathed, I foresaw that plan ending in some sort of tragic, accidental Fargo scenario.</p><p>Jason Cordner was my first serious boyfriend. I\u2019d dated casually before, but the boys I chose were either as dull as a box of mud or closet sociopaths. I\u2019d moved back home, licking my wounds from the inevitable collapse of my studio, and my parents thought I needed \u201cgood influences.\u201d I was on the verge of making up a boyfriend to get my mom off my back when I met Jason at the annual Puckett Labor Day picnic.</p><p>Jason was a junior partner in a law firm my parents occasionally consulted with. I dropped buffalo wings down the back of his polo shirt. He claimed it was love at first sight. I think he might have gotten barbecue sauce in his eye.</p><p>I liked Jason. He didn\u2019t light my world on fire at first, but he seemed like a genuinely nice guy, a kind person. He made me laugh. He let me in on intimate little details that none of my previous boyfriends had shared, such as home address and marital status. And he made me feel centered, special, as if I was a fascinating work in progress, instead of an enormous fuck-up. We did all of the normal, boring things that normal, boring couples did. Pizza, Half-Moon Hollow High football games, arguing whether to watch a Sandra Bullock movie or Vin Diesel. He introduced me to his best friend, Lisa, who\u2019d lived next door since they were kids.</p><p>The year we were together was the calmest of my life. Jason thought it was \u201ccute\u201d that I loved photography and suggested that I work at the Sears photo studio part-time if the artistic urge struck. My parents saw our relationship as some sort of sign that I was growing up. They stopped questioning me like a naughty teenager every time I left the house. They stopped telling quite so many embarrassing stories about me at family dinners. I think they were afraid that they were going to scare Jason off. They could not have been happier when Jason proposed, Daddy because it meant that I was someone else\u2019s problem now and Mom because it meant that I wouldn\u2019t move away from Half-Moon Hollow and she\u2019d be able to keep an eye on me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Because of their assurances that they were \u201clike brother and sister,\u201d I accepted Jason and Lisa\u2019s relationship at face value. I overlooked inside jokes, frequent hugs, and sickeningly sweet nicknames. And then, one afternoon, I was shopping for wedding dresses with Lisa\u2014my maid of honor\u2014and she left her purse in the dressing room with me. Her phone went off while she went to look at a veil, and I recognized Jason\u2019s text ringtone, the clink-clink sound from Law and Order. I ignored it once, and twice, and three times. He texted her four times in the span of about three minutes, and even though I knew it was a bad idea to look at her phone, my curiosity won out. The texts were descriptive and detailed. He was so in love with her, he typed out in painstaking text-speak, but so confused. He loved me, but he felt like a fraud when he was with me. He didn\u2019t want to hurt me, but he didn\u2019t want to lose her. He begged her not to give up on him while he \u201cfigured things out.\u201d</p><p>To say that I flipped my shit in the middle of the Bridal Barn was an understatement. Because I also flipped a rack of plus-sized mother-of-the-bride dresses and a display of bridal tiaras and the cash register, all in an effort to get my hands on Lisa.</p><p>I paid for the damages out of a weekly deduction from my Puckett and Puckett paycheck.</p> <p>Most of the damages.</p><p>Jason\u2019s betrayal wrecked me in ways I hadn\u2019t imagined possible. I didn\u2019t get out of bed for days ... after my dad bailed me out of jail for the public-disturbance charges. I didn\u2019t eat. I didn\u2019t sleep. I didn\u2019t realize how much I could hurt until the first man I\u2019d opened my heart to considered me second-best. I\u2019d loved him. I\u2019d loved what I thought was a kind heart, a strong soul. He was always so good, so open with me; I didn\u2019t think he\u2019d ever lie to me. I didn\u2019t think he was capable of it. I\u2019d loved the life I thought we were going to lead together. I thought that making a life with someone, accepting all of his quirks and differences, seemed like the ultimate epic adventure. And I\u2019d worked hard to make myself into the woman I thought he deserved. I honestly tried to make the best of my job at the law firm. I let my mother select a work wardrobe for me at the Elegant Professional Boutique, which specialized in pantsuits in a dazzling array of taupe. I stopped dyeing neon streaks into my hair. Eventually, the most exciting part of my day was choosing which flavor of yogurt to take with me for lunch.</p><p>Little by little, I\u2019d given up so much of myself, and the painfully embarrassing thing was that Jason hadn\u2019t even asked me to. I\u2019d done it willingly, because I thought it was what he wanted. It turned out, of course, that what he wanted was Lisa. After all of that, he still didn\u2019t want me. The life I thought we would share didn\u2019t mean anything to him. If it had, he would have been honest with me. He wouldn\u2019t have been able to tell another woman that he loved her.</p><p>Jason was torn\u2014and not in the way I wanted him to be. When he realized that I was going to call off the wedding because of what he insisted was just an emotional affair, he promised me that it was over. The wedding plans had scared him, he insisted, and he\u2019d panicked. That was something I could understand. Mom\u2019s daily quizzes on napkin colors and floral preferences nearly drove me to the brink, and I was supposed to be interested in that stuff. I felt terrible, listening to his voice, that I hadn\u2019t noticed how stressed he was. Maybe if I\u2019d picked up on it, we could have avoided this whole mess.</p><p>I wanted to believe him. I wanted to forgive him. I wasn\u2019t ready to give up what I thought we\u2019d had together or my parents\u2019 tacit approval. But my anger kept getting the better of me. Every once in a while, I would be overwhelmed with the urge to punch Jason in the throat. I couldn\u2019t seem to stop checking his texts whenever he left the room. I wanted to trust him, but after reading the sweet, loving messages he\u2019d sent his supposedly platonic best friend, I felt this weird need to assure myself of his fidelity. I was starting to feel like that crazy girl you saw on episodes of Cheaters, and I hated every moment of it, so I broke it off with him. And even though part of me still loved him, I canceled all of the reservations and wedding plans. The ring relay cycle began. I gave it back. He returned it. I gave it back. He returned it.</p> <p>On our scheduled wedding day, when Jason said he had something to ask me, I said I had something to tell him. He went first and proposed all over again. I responded that I would be leaving in two days to take a vampire-transport job from Iris and needed the time to think about whether I\u2019d ever be ready to trust him again. I was determined to make a final decision on the road. When I got back, I told him, I was either going to commit to Jason or give back his ring permanently.</p><p>I was pretty sure he wished that I\u2019d gone first.</p><p>These were heavy thoughts, unwelcome distractions, as I made my way across an empty parking lot, also known as the lonely serial killer\u2019s playground. As I crossed the battered concrete partition that separated the motel lot from the restaurant, I heard the faint plinks of gravel skittering across blacktop behind me. The hairs on the back of my neck prickled up. I was being watched. I could feel eyes sliding over my skin like some icky radar system. I squared my shoulders and listened attentively as I moved.</p><p>I was about thirty paces from the motel office, twice that to my room. I could break out at a run, but that could provoke the nasty \u201cchase\u201d instinct common in parking-lot predators. And there was a good chance that I could trip and smash my face on a speed bump.</p><p>When I\u2019d worked at Bite, a vampire bar just outside Chicago, the bouncer trained the waitresses on basic self-defense. The owner didn\u2019t want us walking to our cars after closing without some idea of how to take care of ourselves. I actually did pretty well in my sparring matches, despite the fact that Tino the bouncer was roughly the size of a compact car. Tino speculated that my unique ability to find trouble meant that I spent more quality time in panic mode than the average person. Being accustomed to the fight-or-flight response, I was able to channel all of my adrenaline into hurting someone besides myself. After I called Tino a number of colorful names, I thanked him for his helpful insight.</p><p>My ability to defend myself in rough situations\u2014along with a brief but memorable stint as a taxi driver in Cleveland\u2014turned into quite the selling point for my boss, Iris, during the hiring process. I could parallel-park and adjust my radio while flipping a rude gesture at another driver, all the while calculating a 20-percent tip in my head. I demonstrated my skills to Iris when she hired me. She asked me never to do it again.</p> <p>I slowed my steps, unwilling to stop completely and look around. I popped my thumbs, shaking the blood into my fingers, still hoping that I could make it to my room without confronting Mr. Parking Lot Creeper. It had been a very long time since my last sparring match with Tino, and I stood a pretty good chance of pulling something. Driving long hours the next day with a wrenched hamstring would suck.</p><p>Seriously, where is half-naked, oil-covered Jason Statham when you need him? I wondered, thinking of The Transporter and how he would handle this situation.</p><p>The crunch of gravel moved closer, maybe five paces behind me.</p><p>Stand and fight it was, then.</p><p>Just as I was about to turn and yell at whoever it was to leave me the hell alone, I heard a shout and the sound of feet dragging across pavement. Two mismatched truckers in full plaid regalia had Mr. Sutherland pinned against a car, wrapping a thick chain around his middle. My client seemed more embarrassed than angry, his fangs in full play as he spoke in that rapid, clipped accent. \u201cGet your hands off of me, you cretins!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe caught you, asshole! You don\u2019t sneak up on ladies like that!\u201d the heavier of the two truckers shouted in a heavy Texas accent, giving Mr. Sutherland a violent shake. His arms, bared by ripped sleeves, were as thick as tree trunks and twice as gnarly. His partner had more of a straw-blown build, dirty-blond hair, and a lazy eye that seemed to follow me as I stormed over to them.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d I yelled. \u201cLet him go!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet back!\u201d the lankier trucker yelled. \u201cGo to your room, honey. Just get out of here. Let us take care of this.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d I demanded as he looped the chain around Mr. Sutherland\u2019s arms, pinning them to his waist. His skin sizzled and smoked where the chain came into contact with his wrists. These idiots must have sprayed the chain down with colloidal silver, a common trick among bar brawlers who were unsure of whether their opponents were living or undead. For vampires, touching it resulted in burning, itching, weakened muscles and, eventually, a wish for death. And Mr. Sutherland was sort of emo, anyway.</p><p>I surged forward, making a grab for him, but Lanky caught my arm and dragged me away to a \u201csafe distance.\u201d My hand clamped over my purse strap, and I yanked free, using Lanky\u2019s body momentum to shove him a good arm\u2019s length away.</p><p>\u201cSaw this foreign jackwagon following you from the diner, all stealthy-like,\u201d said Heavy-Set, his bewhiskered jowls aquiver. \u201cWe figured he wanted to make you his midnight snack or worse. Girlie, don\u2019t you know better than to wander at night when there are vampires running around? We saved your life!\u201d</p><p>I turned on Mr. Sutherland. \u201cYou were following me? Really?\u201d</p><p>Mr. Sutherland huffed indignantly but didn\u2019t comment, what with the silver cutting into his flesh and slowly poisoning him.</p><p>\u201cThe way we look at it, you owe us a little reward,\u201d Lanky said, posturing and leering at me.</p><p>\u201cLook, I appreciate the thought ... and the inappropriate, ultimately doomed flirting,\u201d I said, approaching them slowly with my hands up.</p><p>Weakened by silver, Mr. Sutherland sagged against the car. Heavy-Set was leaning on him, counting on his bulk and the silver to keep my vampire client in place. But the trucker\u2019s feet were set too close together, and his center of gravity was too low. One hard push, and Mr. Sutherland could get loose.</p><p>Lanky was circling a bit too close to me for my comfort, arms down at his sides, because I was no threat, in his mind.</p><p>I smiled sweetly and added, \u201cAnd I understand the urge to hurt him. Hell, I\u2019ve only known him for a couple of hours, and I would gladly punch him in the junk for you. The problem with that is that the grumpy, slightly creepy guy you\u2019re wrangling is my responsibility. I\u2019ve got to deliver him halfway across the country in three days. I get paid less if he\u2019s banged up and silver-scarred.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou work for them?\u201d Lanky demanded, thoroughly disgusted. \u201cFor vampires?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s clich\u00e9, but the dental plan is amazing,\u201d I deadpanned. \u201cSo what I need you to do is step away from the vampire and move along.\u201d</p><p>Heavy-Set shook his head, twisting the chain a bit tighter around Mr. Sutherland and dragging him toward the bed of their truck. \u201cNope, I can\u2019t let that happen. You need to be protected from yourself, honey. And that means we teach Mr. Dead here that you don\u2019t stalk ladies in parking lots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, he won\u2019t be able to hurt you,\u201d Lanky assured me. \u201cWe\u2019ll take care of him.\u201d</p><p>I sighed. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry about this, but I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t let that happen.\u201d</p><p>While Lanky was distracted by Mr. Sutherland\u2019s struggles, I brought my arm down, just hard enough to pop him on the side of the neck. Tino would have been very proud. The bony heel of my hand connected with the supersensitive brachial nerve, and Lanky\u2019s legs folded under him as if some cruel puppeteer had cut his strings. He collapsed, boneless, and his head bounced against the pavement with a solid thunk that set my teeth on edge.</p><p>He was going to feel that in the morning.</p><p>I shot a look over my shoulder, to where Mr. Sutherland had shimmied free from the chain and held Heavy-Set by his neck, his feet dangling four inches off the ground. It would appear that Mr. Sutherland had regained his strength rather quickly.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell do you think you\u2019re doing, attacking a vampire in a parking lot? Are you nuts?\u201d I demanded as the redneck coughed and wheezed, clawing at the hands clutching his throat. I gently tapped Mr. Sutherland on the shoulder. He snarled at me, fangs bared. I took a step back, my hands raised. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to understand him when he can\u2019t breathe. Damn it, Mr. Sutherland, put him down!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I kept waiting for him to release his grip on the wayward do-gooder, but he continued to hold him. \u201cLanguage, Miss Puckett.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Sutherland,\u201d I said, clearing my throat, \u201cI think it would be better if we just sent these men on their way. They didn\u2019t mean any harm ... to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t see them coming,\u201d Mr. Sutherland seethed.</p> <p>That ... was an odd response.</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s been a while since you\u2019ve been out of the house, right?\u201d I told him. \u201cMaybe your instincts are just a little off. I\u2019m sure in a day or so, you\u2019ll be back to your hyperaware, completely paranoid self.\u201d</p><p>He growled, squeezing Heavy-Set\u2019s throat until he turned a disturbing shade of puce.</p><p>\u201cIf you kill him, it\u2019s going to mean calling the police, filing a bunch of paperwork, and missing your deadline with the Council,\u201d I reminded him.</p><p>With a hiss, Mr. Sutherland dropped Heavy-Set to his feet. Heavy-Set sank to his knees, coughing and sputtering. He saw his friend crumpled on the pavement like a battered rag doll. \u201cDamn it, you killed Mel!\u201d</p> <p>I stepped between Heavy-Set and Mr. Sutherland. \u201cYour friend should be fine in a few minutes. Just make him sit up slowly, and help him get up on his feet. He\u2019s going to be sort of wobbly. And please tell him I\u2019m really sorry about the headache.\u201d</p><p>Heavy-Set struggled to his feet. He pulled at Lanky\u2019s arms, dragging his dead weight to the truck and barely missing shutting the door on his leg as it flopped uselessly out of the cab. They screeched out of the parking lot as if their taillights were on fire.</p><p>I turned to Mr. Sutherland with as much poise as I could muster and demanded, \u201cWhat the hell? Why were you following me? What are you even doing out of the room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to keep an eye on you. I wanted to make sure I could trust you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019m untrustworthy because I deviated from your precious schedule?\u201d I demanded. \u201cWhat, you thought I was going to meet a co-conspirator at a diner, so we could plan the kidnapping of the most anal-retentive, fastidious vampire since Freud? You have more issues than National Geographic.\u201d</p><p>Yes, Freud was a vampire, which, when you thought about it, made sense. It was the only plausible explanation for his theories\u2019 maintaining academic credence for so long.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t see anything coming when I\u2019m with you,\u201d he bit out, his voice frustrated and gravelly. The cords of his neck stood out as he loomed over me. His hands rose as if he was going to grasp my arms.</p><p>I stood, teetering on the edge of a choice. Let him touch me, give in to the strange skittering thrill his voice sent up my spine, or move and maintain my sanity.</p><p>I grunted, backing away. \u201cWhat does that even mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d he shouted back.</p><p>\u201cFine!\u201d I huffed, turning on my heel toward the motel. I\u2019d had enough of this crap for one night. What gave him the right to follow me? Spy on me? Let him call Iris. Let him tell her why I had to save his butt from redneck bystanders. Heck, she might hire me full-time. At the moment, I just wanted to shower and get some sleep before we had to get back on the road.</p><p>Mr. Sutherland kept pace with me, checking over his shoulder every few seconds to make sure we weren\u2019t being followed. \u201cHow exactly did you manage to overpower a man twice your size, if you don\u2019t mind my asking?\u201d</p><p>I stopped, tilting my head toward him. \u201cIris didn\u2019t tell you about my background, did she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour CV did not include mentions of your amateur cage-fighting career, no,\u201d he said as I unlocked my room door.</p> <p>\u201cCan you keep a secret?\u201d I asked, giving a sly little grin as I leaned closer.</p><p>His lips quirked, and for the first time, I saw what his face looked like without that mocking veneer. His eyes crinkled a bit at the corners, twinkling at me in mischievous pleasure. \u201cI\u2019m a vampire. Of course, I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo can I.\u201d With a sharp smile, I slammed the door in his face.</p><p>Motel showers were always a crapshoot. The temperature always seemed to hover between \u201cweakly warm\u201d and \u201chuman lobster.\u201d And there was always the chance that you could find new friends with more legs than you, scuttling out from under the shower curtain. I really hated that. But the Pine Heights showers seemed bug-free, if lacking water pressure.</p><p>The rush of smacking someone around had finally ebbed, and I was drained of all energy. I had to lean against the wall to wash off the road dirt with a washcloth that could have doubled as sandpaper. I slipped into boxers and a wife-beater, enjoying the chance to go braless after more than eighteen hours of being lifted and separated. I towel-dried my thick hair, humming the melody to a Lady Gaga song and reveling in the thought of sleep.</p><p>After digging lip balm and a paperback\u2014my nighttime essentials\u2014out of my shoulder bag, I tossed the towel aside. I coated my lips in Burt\u2019s Bees balm and found my place in my Catch-22. I\u2019d only read two paragraphs before the door connecting our adjoining rooms rattled under thunderous, rapid knocks from the other side. Forgetting my braless state, I opened the door to find Mr. Sutherland wearing emerald-green monogrammed silk pajamas and a stricken expression.</p><p>Had I fallen asleep and woken up in a Rock Hudson movie?</p><p>He glanced down, eyes widening at my skimpy sleepwear. I cleared my throat. \u201cCan I help you?\u201d</p><p>He grimaced, far more Tony Randall than Rock. \u201cMy wallet is missing.\u201d</p><p>A DAY WITHOUT A SWORN AFFIDAVIT IS LIKE A DAY WITHOUT SUNSHINE</p><p>3</p><p>I laughed. There was no other choice. I could have sworn that Mr. Sutherland had just broken into my room wearing full-on Hefner PJs to tell me his wallet had been stolen. His wallet, which contained the credit card we were using to book hotel rooms and buy my meals, was missing. That was the height of fricking hilarity as far as I was concerned.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you laughing?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cY-you\u2019re wearing pajamas.\u201d I giggled. \u201cYou\u2019re not even going to sleep. You went to the trouble of packing pajamas, and you don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>He glowered down at me. I realized that I was bent at the waist, hee-hawing like a fool, giving an agitated vampire a full down-to-the-navel view of my cleavage. I sobered and straightened, giving him an apologetic little smile.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure it\u2019s not in your room somewhere?\u201d I asked carefully, wiping my eyes. \u201cOr maybe in the car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think I would have knocked if I had not already turned my room upside-down looking for it?\u201d he asked sarcastically.</p><p>I thought back to our run-in with Lanky and Heavy-Set. They\u2019d had more than enough time to snake Mr. Sutherland\u2019s wallet out of his pocket while they were wrestling around with him. Between the silver and the strange overtures, both of us had been pretty distracted. Had the whole \u201cGood Samaritan Stooges\u201d act been just that, an act? Had mugging my client been the point all along? Had they driven off, stunned and scared, only to pull into another parking lot and pretend to care whether another girl was being targeted as an easy mark?</p><p>I think that hurt my feelings a little bit.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it was in my jacket pocket when we were ... out,\u201d he said vehemently. Suddenly, an expression of indignant shock twisted his features. \u201cI think those ruffians from the parking lot might have taken it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t say!\u201d I groaned, scrubbing my hands over my face.</p><p>His expression was grim, and still somehow incredulous, when I tossed him my phone. \u201cCall all of your credit-card companies to report the thefts. My phone has Internet access, so you can look up all of the customer-service numbers. They\u2019ll probably require that you file a police report before they send replacement cards. If you call the police, wake me up, and I\u2019ll give them a statement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to sleep? Now?\u201d he asked, frowning.</p><p>\u201cYes, unless you want to miss your deadline because I fell asleep at the wheel and crashed the car. You can stay up long enough to make your calls, leave my phone on the nightstand, then sleep through the day. Just make sure you crawl into the car cubby before sunset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou make a surprisingly reasonable argument,\u201d he grumbled. \u201cI assume you\u2019re going to call Miss Scanlon to report this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm-hmm,\u201d I said, in the least committal tone one could use without being struck down by lightning for lying. \u201cGood night.\u201d</p><p>I closed the door and bumped my forehead against the cold, unyielding metal. There was no way in hell I was calling Iris. Not only had I allowed a client to get assaulted, but now he\u2019d been mugged, too? This was not how one repaid a favor from an old friend.</p><p>I snatched up my own bag and found that my wallet was intact. Beeline employees weren\u2019t allowed to use our company \u201cfleet\u201d cards for anything except gas. A digital lock on the cards allowed use only at service stations. Iris said it kept clients from bulldozing us into covering our own meals and hotel fees with company funds. She\u2019d been stiffed too many times by clients who welched once the receipts were submitted for reimbursement. Vampires hated receipts.</p><p>Mr. Sutherland and I would just have to survive on my meager plastic until we reached the Hollow. I had just enough room on my MasterCard to make it work. I could only hope that Iris would be so impressed with my creatively overcoming the obstacle that she didn\u2019t offer me up to the vampires as a party snack.</p><p>I flopped down on the lumpy motel mattress and buried my face in the flat, flaccid pillow. \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t he have just taken the train?\u201d</p><p>Six A.M. came far too quickly. And I woke to find that any commiserating camaraderie I might have built with Mr. Sutherland the night before had evaporated with the sunrise. A note, neatly folded under my phone on the nightstand, managed to insult me in an impressively elegant script.</p><p>Dear Miss Puckett,</p><p>When you manage to rouse yourself, you will find that I am safely tucked away in the car.</p><p>I spoke to the police last night to file an incident report. There was no problem with the credibility of my statement, as the blundering duo we encountered have perpetrated this scheme before on couples undead and living\u2014pretending to protect the female from assault while picking the male\u2019s pocket.</p><p>\u201cI knew it,\u201d I muttered to myself.</p><p>Security video shows the rogues following you from what can loosely be termed a restaurant, so the police know whom they must take into custody. The officers need affidavits from both of us to prosecute the charges after we leave town. I gave mine last night. I took the liberty of writing a statement from your perspective, which will reflect the information given in my own. You will find that the handwriting matches the rather unique penmanship I found on a grocery list in your purse.</p><p>\u201cWhat the\u2014boundaries!\u201d I gasped, hopping out of bed to retrieve my shoulder bag. The list in question was tucked under the purse strap. Apparently, I\u2019d needed \u201ctampons, Fiber One bars, and depilatory cream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKill me now.\u201d</p><p>I glanced at the bottom of my bag and saw that my photo journal had been disturbed. The white ribbon I usually kept around it, a castoff from one of my mother\u2019s Tiffany gift boxes, was tied into a pristine square knot that I couldn\u2019t manage if my life depended on it.</p><p>\u201cYou asshole!\u201d I hissed at the offending piece of paper. \u201cYou presumptuous, invasive vampire asshole!\u201d</p><p>Sutherland had rifled through my stuff. He\u2019d looked through the album of photos that I kept just for me, remembrances of moments in my life that I wanted to keep with me forever. He\u2019d touched my things, touched my memories, without asking, because he thought being undead or being the client gave him the right.</p><p>I was going to be hitting the brakes without warning a lot today.</p><p>I gritted my teeth and continued to read, all the while muttering curses under my breath.</p><p>The officers asked that you sign the statement and bring it by the department offices before we leave town. Please make this a priority before any other errands. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>To maintain our schedule, I expect that we will reach the Idaho state line by the time I rise.

Murdering a client while he slept was immoral, I supposed. But I didn\u2019t like my chances if I tried while he was awake.</p><p>I rose from the thin hotel sheets, stiff and achy, stretching my arms over my head. In the two weeks I\u2019d been home, prepping for this job, I hadn\u2019t had time to find a decent yoga studio in Half-Moon Hollow\u2014I wasn\u2019t entirely sure there was a decent yoga studio in Half-Moon Hollow. But it was either take a beginner\u2019s class in a church basement or try to stretch the knots out of my back on my own ... and the last time I did that, I ended up with a puncture wound from a wrought-iron palm-tree sculpture.</p><p>Don\u2019t ask.</p><p>I found the affidavit folded carefully on top of my purse. The narrative was scrawled in my own loopy half-cursive, half-block script. Mr. Sutherland\u2019s statement was very similar to what actually happened, apparently omitting the part where I\u2019d had to smack Lanky around to come to Mr. Sutherland\u2019s aid. Whether that was an effort to prevent legal trouble for me or to protect his own pride, I had no idea. But it was harmless enough, and I signed it.</p><p>I repacked my bag, carefully checking over the room to make sure that I hadn\u2019t left anything like my wallet or my reading glasses behind. I mapped the route to the local police department, confirmed that my phone was fully charged, and walked into the pink light of sunrise. I blinked rapidly, sliding classic Ray-Bans over the bridge of my nose. That was one thing I was going to have to get used to while working with vampires, the shock of daylight.</p> <p>The sun rose slowly over the horizon, framing a rusty, rounded old pickup at the edge of the parking lot in just the right amount of golden, nostalgic light. My fingers itched for my camera, the lovely little high-powered Canon I\u2019d used while working in Chicago. But, like the rest of my equipment, it had been sold off to keep the creditors at bay.</p><p>Three years before, I\u2019d borrowed twenty-five thousand dollars from my parents to buy a share in my then-boss\u2019s photography studio. While moonlighting as a waitress, I\u2019d worked as an assistant and general peon to Anthony Figueroa for more than a year. He was known for edgy wedding photography, wild angles, sexy shots of the bride and groom getting frisky in their wedding attire, shooting the bride underwater in a copy of her gown. Brash, eccentric, and occasionally downright rude, Anthony saw himself as the bride\u2019s last chance to rebel in an otherwise cookie-cutter affair planned by her mother. The business was growing by leaps and bounds, and my parents were impressed enough to loan me the money to buy into the studio.</p><p>Partnership with Anthony was supposed to give me time to shoot what he called my \u201cartsy-fartsy\u201d photos of the city I loved so much. But during my brief tenure as a professional photographer, I spent most of my time shooting stock photos for online services. If a bakery needed professional-quality photos of a cupcake for an ad but couldn\u2019t afford a photo shoot, they could go online and buy a stock photo from an online broker. Once Anthony saw how much the services were willing to pay and how quickly I could crank the photos out, I spent weeks painstakingly lighting and shooting an apple, a stapler, women in various stages of frazzled distress. I think those were either for male-escort ads or housekeeping services. I never figured out which.</p><p>The monotony, the void of creativity, sort of sucked the fun out of photography for me. I never left the studio. I had to follow prescribed rules about resolution, composition, and color saturation. And when I took my usual long walks down to the river, I\u2019d line up a shot of bridge architecture or a family laughing, and I\u2019d be so worried about aperture and film speed that I\u2019d lose the shot.</p><p>And then, in his creative wisdom, Anthony removed portions of a hundred-year-old window casing in St. Thomas Church to attach his precious strobe flashes, making it look as though the bride was caught in a Gothic lightning storm. The window casing was permanently damaged, and the studio was sued into bankruptcy by the bride\u2019s family, the church, the local historical society, and the Catholic League. Also, we may have been excommunicated.</p><p>My investment capital, the equipment, our building\u2014everything was liquidated to pay off our debts. So I owned 7 percent of exactly jack squat, but I owed my parents 5-percent interest on the loan. Anthony\u2019s reputation, which was already hanging by a thread thanks to his scorched-earth policy when it came to other photographers, was ruined, as was mine by association. With no job prospects and the loan debt hanging over my head, my parents demanded that I \u201cstop all of the foolishness and get a real job,\u201d which meant working for the firm.</p><p>Let this be a lesson to you, kids. Don\u2019t borrow money from your parents. It gets ugly.</p><p>Now I was left with my little portfolio of \u201cartsy-fartsy\u201d photos and my old first-generation digital camera. If my Canon had been a Porsche, my old camera was more along the lines of a Toyota Tercel. But I always kept it with me, buried in the bottom of my shoulder bag, in case the mood struck.</p> <p>I took the old Nikon out of my bag, lined up the shot, and forced myself to forget exposure times or saturation. I just took a quick breath and snapped. I didn\u2019t even bother checking the screen for the result. I just loaded my bags into the back of the car, noting that Mr. Sutherland\u2019s luggage was already stacked neatly in the rack. I checked the cubby door and noted that the special \u201coccupied\u201d tag had been switched on. Like those handy little tabs on airplane lavatory doors, it could only be engaged from inside. It was meant to keep humans from opening the light-tight cubbies during the day, exposing the vampires to dangerous rays. In my case, there was the added bonus of knowing that I wasn\u2019t driving off without my client.</p><p>After dropping the report off at the police department, I plugged that night\u2019s approved motel\u2019s address into my phone and prepared to drive at least eight hundred miles to make up for time we lost the night before. According to his calculations, it would take me three full days to drive the twenty-four hundred miles from his home to mine and give him a few hours to spare before his midnight deadline. I would be allowed a short break just before sunset to rest and eat, and then we would drive until eight or so. I was allowed exactly ten hours of \u201coff time\u201d per night, and we were expected to be on the road within an hour of sunrise.</p><p>Iris was convinced that people drove more safely during the day. And no one would suspect a vampire of driving around during the day in what looked like a badass soccer-mom vehicle.</p><p>Given Mr. Sutherland\u2019s parking-lot experience, I guessed I couldn\u2019t blame him for being a little paranoid. In 1999, this whole public vampirism thing left a lot of humans unsure of our place in the food chain, which could lead to ugly confrontations.</p><p>It was as if vampires had walked into the proverbial room, and the entire world stopped talking at once. The first year \u201cpostvampire\u201d was a pretty dark chapter in terms of our collective history. The World Council for the Equal Treatment of the Undead formed to \u201cformally interact with human governments and facilitate open, cordial communication.\u201d In other words, they busted their way into the homes of presidents, prime ministers, and dictators around the world and told them, \u201cQuit killing us off for giggles, or prepare for an ass whipping of biblical proportions.\u201d</p><p>The American government issued mandatory after-dark curfews out of fear that vampires would retaliate en masse. So humans found ways to track vampires to their sleeping places during the day, making daytime vampire security a sought-after, ridiculously overpriced service.</p><p>Enter Iris Scanlon and her business, Beeline, a daytime concierge service for vampires. Beeline was part special-event coordinator, part concierge service, part personal organizer. Iris took care of all of the little details that vampires couldn\u2019t see to without bursting into cinders or just didn\u2019t want to deal with themselves. Picking up dry-cleaning, filing government paperwork, delivering blood, receiving deliveries of household items. The transport service was an experimental venture, and so far, it didn\u2019t seem likely that Iris was going to be adding it to the menu of regular Beeline services.</p><p>I drove hypercarefully through the northeast corner of Oregon to Idaho, driving two miles under the limit and steering as if I was performing neurosurgery. But the drive was a productive one. I learned the words to three Nickelback songs, which meant that I could eventually make fun of three more Nickelback songs. I caught up on The Help, an audio book I\u2019d been saving for a special occasion. My cell phone rang frequently, and I ignored it.</p><p>I drove without thinking, without planning. I just enjoyed the scenery and the music and the blissful solitude. I ate gummy worms and trail mix. I went through several of the playlists on the iPod I\u2019d plugged into the stereo system. I loved creating a mood-setting list for every occasion, everything from the \u201cYou\u2019ve Been Up for Far Too Long List,\u201d which included a lot of peppy \u201980s music, to the \u201cWork the Pole List,\u201d which I\u2019d rather not go into.</p><p>I may or may not have made several stops along the way to take pictures of the mountains and a broken-down drive-in movie theater in the middle of nowhere. Yes, it was a calculated risk, but I had to enjoy something about this trip. I could feel my joints loosening when I held the camera. The pictures weren\u2019t particularly good, certainly not good enough to include in my photo journal. I preferred to take shots with some people in them, but for now, it was a good workout, so to speak.</p><p>Other than spilling coffee down the front of my blouse, a minor injury sustained while locking a bathroom stall, and a brief run-in with an RV driver who didn\u2019t seem to recognize \u201cno passing\u201d zones, the day went off without a hitch.</p><p>Just after sunset, as we left Idaho, I heard bumping around in the cubby. I pulled over on the lonely stretch of I-90 with my emergency flashers blinking and pulled out the warmed packet of blood that Mr. Sutherland had requested.</p><p>The evening was pleasant and mild. The blacktop radiated heat against my legs as I made my way around the car. There was no road noise, just the chirp of crickets and the wind over drying grass. I opened the back hatch of the car, just as the cubby door swung up.</p><p>Mr. Sutherland sat up as if he was on a hinge, in one smooth upward motion. His three-piece suit\u2014dark charcoal gray with a faint pinstripe\u2014was perfectly pressed. The only thing mussed about him was his hair, arranged in that flawlessly tousled, \u201crecently laid\u201d arrangement. The suit made me think of that Gary Oldman Dracula movie, which made me think of Keanu Reeves\u2019s English accent, which made me giggle.</p><p>Hungry vampires were irritable vampires, so I choked it back, making an indelicate snorting noise, as I thrust the blood packet toward him. He took it, eyebrow raised at my display, and drained it immediately.</p><p>\u201cAnother?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He shook his head, watching me carefully. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to spoon-feed me. I\u2019m not a newborn.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGood morning to you, too, sir,\u201d I retorted with a little curtsey.</p><p>He gracefully slid out of the vehicle, straightening his cuffs, and stood over me.

His mouth bowed south. \u201cYou do realize that you\u2019re supposed to drink the coffee, not bathe in it, yes?\u201d</p><p>I glanced down. How did he know I\u2019d dumped half a cup of coffee into my cleavage? I\u2019d changed my stained blouse hours before on one of my scheduled bathroom stops. I sniffed my shirt and only detected the slightest scent of coffee, which was coming from ... my bra. He was smelling my bra. Well, that was gross.</p> <p>\u201cCaffeine tightens the pores,\u201d I retorted, rounding the car. \u201cAre you planning to ride shotgun, or\u2014\u201d I watched as Mr. Sutherland slid into the backseat. \u201cOK, then.\u201d</p><p>He opened his atlas and checked our progress against the map. He frowned. Without looking up, he asked, \u201cDid you submit the police report this morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. That was a creepily accurate forgery of my handwriting, by the way.\u201d</p><p>He ignored the compliment-slash-jibe. \u201cDid you contact Miss Scanlon and let her know about our difficulties? Did she make arrangements for our travel expenses?\u201d</p><p>I cleared my throat and nodded. \u201cMm-hmm.\u201d</p> <p>I glanced down at my phone, noting that while we were standing outside, I\u2019d received another call from my mother. I grumbled, shoving it into my purse, and then turned the keys in the ignition.</p><p>\u201cMiss Puckett.\u201d</p><p>I looked up into the rearview mirror to see blue eyes glaring at me. I moved to put the car into gear, and the frown deepened.</p><p>His velvety voice was more insistent\u2014and slightly pissed at being ignored. \u201cMiss Puckett.\u201d</p><p>I shoved the gearshift back into park. When I turned to face him, I was smiling so sweetly I feared my cheeks would crack. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>He had his arm stretched across the backseat in a casual, \u201cNice to finally meet you, Mr. Bond\u201d supervillain pose. The top of his light blue shirt was unbuttoned, revealing the perfectly symmetrical hollow of his throat. A sudden, compulsive urge to lick that narrow expanse of skin, framed by slender cords of muscle, overwhelmed my brain, and I had to grip the steering wheel to keep myself in the front seat.</p> <p>Did they make Adam\u2019s apple porn? Was that a thing? Would I be scarred for life if I Googled it? And if I couldn\u2019t find any pictures, could I take my own? My camera was in the bottom of my bag\u2014</p><p>And then I realized that I was staring at Mr. Sutherland\u2019s throat cleavage ... and he was clearly aware of this. I could tell by the curious lift of his eyebrow. My cheeks flamed, a rush of blood beneath my skin that shocked as much as it shamed. How could a stare\u2014well, let\u2019s be honest, it was a glare\u2014be enough to make my panties spontaneously combust?</p><p>I cleared my throat, breaking contact with the blue orbs of sexy evil. \u201cIs there some reason I shouldn\u2019t be starting the car right now?\u201d</p><p>He let his eyes narrow at the offending piece of paper on my dashboard.</p><p>I snatched it up. \u201cWhat, this?\u201d</p><p>His lip curled back into a grimace. \u201cYes, Miss Puckett. What is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be a hamburger wrapper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he purred. \u201cAnd what do we know about hamburger wrappers?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTheir contents are meaty and delicious?\u201d</p><p>His lips twitched, as if he wanted to laugh but couldn\u2019t bring himself to do it. \u201cLitter, Miss Puckett. The car is to be free of litter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, sorry,\u201d I said, stuffing the offending paper into a paper sack. \u201cVampires have an aversion to human food, right? It smells spoiled to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I dislike the idea of riding around with your lunch leftovers for the rest of the evening.\u201d He sniffed. I started the car and pulled onto the shoulder. He nodded slightly. \u201cBut yes, vampires lack the enzymes to digest solids, so our bodies instinctively reject human food. The smell is unappetizing. And if we ate so much as a slice of bread, violent vomiting would follow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s unfortunate, given our next stop.\u201d</p><p>I CAN SEE YOUR HEADLIGHTS</p><p>4</p><p>Pete\u2019s Diner was bright and cheerfully decorated in insistently nostalgic aquas and pinks. I sat at the booth, considering my menu options, while Mr. Sutherland glowered at our general surroundings. A less mature part of myself wanted to order something really pungent, such as olive loaf and onion rings. But I chose considerately, turkey on whole wheat and an iced tea.</p><p>Mr. Sutherland looked as out of place as I did when I visited my parents\u2019 law firm. He ordered a coffee so he wouldn\u2019t seem conspicuous and sat ramrod-straight against the cozy booth seat. He was staring me down, measuring me, recording little details, and he meticulously polished his silverware with his napkin. I did my best not to fidget or make origami out of the straw wrappers.</p><p>\u201cI know that we haven\u2019t had an ideal travel experience so far,\u201d I admitted in an effort to break the silence. \u201cHonestly, I\u2019m not trying to annoy you. At this point, all I can promise is that I\u2019m not intentionally trying to do the things that make you angry ... anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am overwhelmed in the face of your generosity.\u201d From the kitchen, I heard the hiss of onions hitting the grill. Mr. Sutherland shuddered as the sharp smell rippled through the air, adding another layer to the symphony of scents already hanging over the diner.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who scheduled my meal breaks,\u201d I reminded him without my usual sarcasm. \u201cIt\u2019s not my fault you did it by location instead of time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but I thought we would be farther along the road by now. I assumed that you would eat dinner before I woke,\u201d he said, eyeing a passing tray full of chili specials as if the secret ingredient was ebola virus.</p><p>\u201cWell, we would be running on time if I hadn\u2019t had to stop at the police station this morning. Contingencies, Mr. Sutherland. They happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmph.\u201d He stirred the coffee, for lack of something to do with his hands, and muttered something like \u201cWith you, they do.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Sutherland had been beyond twitchy from the moment we walked into the diner. He was uncomfortable and not just in the \u201cI\u2019m around a large group of humans for the first time in decades\u201d sort of way. The presence of each additional person seemed to cause him pain.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to come in here with me,\u201d I said, trying to keep my tone kind. \u201cYou could have waited outside, stretched your legs a bit. It can\u2019t be comfortable being cooped up in that cubby.\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes as a family of five passed by, their rambunctious teens hip-checking and elbowing one another for prime booth space. While his eyes were closed, I whipped out my camera and pulled off a few quick shots of the family being generally rowdy and obnoxious to one another. In the frame, they looked loving, happy, comfortable together. It made my heart ache a little.</p><p>And since Mr. Sutherland\u2019s eyes were still closed, his lashes resting on his high cheekbones, I took a few shots of him, too.</p><p>I had my reasons.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine in a few minutes. It\u2019s just an adjustment. Besides, the last time we separated, we were set upon by rednecks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you afraid for my safety or yours?\u201d I asked, smirking at him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure. I do hope Miss Scanlon wasn\u2019t too upset about the trouble last night,\u201d he said, watching me carefully. \u201cI would hate for the incident to reflect poorly on your performance record.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, she wasn\u2019t,\u201d I lied smoothly, as if butter wouldn\u2019t melt in my no-good, deceitful mouth. \u201cShe understands that the unexpected can happen. I have some cash, and I\u2019m going to use a company credit card for our expenses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, thank heavens,\u201d he deadpanned as my turkey sandwich and spicy fries were delivered to the table. \u201cI would hate for you to go without a feast like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you ever had spicy peanut-oil fries?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were a bit outside of my time frame.\u201d</p><p>I dragged one of the beautiful golden fries through a pool of ketchup with a flourish and popped it into my mouth. \u201cWell, don\u2019t knock them until you\u2019ve tried them.\u201d</p><p>He eyed my plate. \u201cI have mentioned the vomiting issue, yes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, which is an awfully nice image while I\u2019m eating, so thank you,\u201d I muttered, chewing carefully to avoid talking with my mouth full. \u201cSo tell me about yourself. When exactly is your \u2018time frame\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you known many vampires, Miss Puckett?\u201d he asked, leaning forward a bit.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I will excuse you, because you clearly don\u2019t know how rude it is to ask a vampire how old he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou brought it up. I\u2019m just trying to make conversation,\u201d I said, shrugging. \u201cIs it OK if I guess?\u201d</p><p>He gave me a withering glare.</p><p>\u201cDo you have any fun?\u201d I asked, tilting my head and frowning at him. \u201cEver?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but am I to understand that I\u2019m serving as your entertainment?\u201d He sniffed, those blue eyes narrowing at me.</p><p>\u201cNot at the moment,\u201d I said, grinning. \u201cCome on, humor me. You\u2019ve still got the hint of a British accent, so I\u2019m guessing you were born there. You have very formal manners. Your clothes are well made and old-fashioned. So ... either you\u2019re used to wealth or you\u2019re trying to make up for something you were missing in life. I haven\u2019t seen your car, so I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s an insecurity that\u2019s universally applied,\u201d I admitted. \u201cYour house is orderly, nearly compulsively so. You have a bit of contempt for, well, everyone around you. I\u2019m guessing ... Revolutionary War. You fought for the British, which explains so much about your personality. You\u2019re still a little bitter about it.\u201d</p><p>His jaw dropped, and for a beautiful moment, he actually looked discomposed. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t possibly have guessed that. Did Miss Scanlon give you a dossier on me?\u201d</p><p>I let him hang. I enjoyed this moment of him seeing me as mysterious and knowledgeable, something more than just the person who drove him crazy with fast-food litter. But then I caved.</p><p>I giggled. \u201cYou have your military insignia displayed on your mantel. That, combined with the accent and the cleanliness, let me make an educated guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to say, I am impressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a people watcher.\u201d I shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s just situational awareness, which is the one area in which I scored in the top percentiles in those personality tests. My high-school career-aptitude results recommended that I go into personal security or rodeo clowning, which my brother had a field day with, by the way. I got floppy red shoes as a graduation gift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease demonstrate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t bring the shoes with me.\u201d I twisted my face into a fake frown.</p><p>Mr. Sutherland huffed, exasperated. \u201cYour parlor trick, Miss Puckett. Please demonstrate your technique.\u201d</p><p>I chuckled, biting into my sandwich. This used to be my dad\u2019s favorite game. When we were waiting at a restaurant or running errands, he\u2019d pick somebody and ask me to tell him their story. Where they were from, what they were doing at the grocery store, who they had to go home to. The stories entertained Daddy, but watching people helped me pick up the right cues, the little things that made for great photos. It was a game that helped me wriggle out of some of the disastrous scenarios I found myself in, long after Daddy lost interest in playing.</p><p>I scanned the dining room and jerked my chin toward a man sitting at the counter. \u201cFine. You see the guy over there? He\u2019s on his way home to his wife after a week of doing incredibly irresponsible stuff with his buddies. Fishing, boating, something like that. He knows she\u2019s going to be mad at him about something, and he\u2019s not entirely sure he wants to drive the rest of the way home.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow can you tell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s twisting his wedding ring around his finger as he bobs his knee at a hundred miles an hour. We\u2019re in the heart of fly-fishing country. He\u2019s sunburned something awful, except right around the eyes, probably from fishing or boating with sunglasses on. A woman would remind her husband to put on sunscreen, whereas a bunch of other guys wouldn\u2019t care. And he\u2019s been looking at his cell phone as if he thinks it\u2019s going to bite him. He\u2019s waiting for her to call and ask where he is and why the hell he isn\u2019t home yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just guessing,\u201d he said, smirking derisively.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s all just guessing. That doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m wrong.\u201d</p><p>As if on cue, the cell phone rang, and the man started stuttering apologies and \u201cNow, honey\u2019s.\u201d I beamed at Mr. Sutherland and popped another fry into my mouth.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really very good at that,\u201d he said, equally confused and awed.</p><p>\u201cTry not to sound so amazed,\u201d I chided. \u201cI do have some skill sets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, cage fighting and impeccable deductive reasoning.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been in a cage. Where are you getting a cage?\u201d I laughed.</p><p>He smirked at me, and I could just make out a hint of a dimple in his cheek. \u201cIt\u2019s far more interesting in my head if there\u2019s a cage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a psychological clue that I\u2019m not willing to explore.\u201d I took a bite of my sandwich and took a moment to appreciate the ambrosial combination of turkey, melted cheese, and bacon. \u201cSo, Collin Sutherland, Revolutionary War soldier,\u201d I said, lowering my voice so the patrons at the other tables didn\u2019t hear. \u201cYou\u2019re a vampire. Why are you afraid to fly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid no one ever teach you how to make polite conversation?\u201d he grumbled, stirring the coffee he was using as a \u201cblending-in\u201d prop.</p><p>\u201cYou would be so bored with me right now if someone had.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you ever read the statistics regarding accidents in air travel?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cYes, they\u2019re lower than the rates of accidents while driving. And you\u2019re pretty much indestructible, as long as you fly at night.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cWell, once one has survived one plane crash, tempting fate again seems ill advised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve survived a plane crash?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the 1940s, when air travel for passengers was very new,\u201d he said. \u201cKicking your way out of a crumpled fuselage rather ruins the thrill of vacationing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you never tried flying again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t left the area immediately surrounding my house since 1948.\u201d</p><p>I spluttered, \u201cH-how? Wh-why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDelivery services. An understanding undead business manager who was willing to handle many of life\u2019s little details for me. Friends who were willing to bring human donors to the house. And there\u2019s a ready supply of wildlife in the area if I wanted to vary my diet.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut how do you make a living?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil my withdrawal from society, I made my living in the antiques business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou had a store?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a speculative venture,\u201d he said, his tone hedging.</p><p>\u201cThe fact that you don\u2019t seem to want to explain that cryptic remark is going to make me ask you lots more questions,\u201d I promised him.</p><p>He sighed and explained, \u201cSay I was sitting in a tavern, and I just happened to sense that a fellow\u2019s brother was about to gamble the family fortune away or that a man\u2019s favorite daughter was about to elope with the help, causing a disastrous scandal. If I just happened to befriend that fellow and be there for him when his tragedy struck, offering my discreet monetary help in return for a few family knickknacks, who would be the wiser? Of course, I offered a reduced price for those knickknacks, and the families were so grateful for aid in their times of distress that they didn\u2019t question my offer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s so mercenary!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the contrary, the families I did business with desperately needed the money I offered them. I was helping them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were helping yourself!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was using the tools I was provided with to make my way in the world. I was raised in a fine house with carefully chosen furnishings. And although I didn\u2019t stand to inherit any of it, I was taught their history, their value. I can\u2019t be faulted for using that knowledge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the fact that you believe that is what is so very troubling.\u201d</p><p>Eyebrows raised, I glanced at the case securely wedged against his side in the booth. That certainly changed my guesses about the case\u2019s contents. Crown jewels? Priceless art? Ancient coins?</p><p>That would be sort of exciting, to know that I was helping complete some Council project or bringing scary-ass Ophelia, the forever-teenage head of the local Council branch, her personal art collection. Maybe that would make her more lenient when I inevitably ran afoul of the local vampires.</p><p>\u201cWhy live out in the middle of nowhere?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been much of a joiner. And as technology has improved, I\u2019ve felt less and less alone. Thanks to the telephone, color television, the Internet, I\u2019ve been able to keep up with current events, terminology. I\u2019m not left entirely out of the loop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy haven\u2019t you left your house in so long? Is it because you were traumatized in the crash? Do you have PTSD?\u201d</p><p>He shifted uncomfortably in his seat. That was an interesting change in role. \u201cNot exactly.\u201d</p><p>The tone of his voice didn\u2019t invite further questions, so in the interest of the progress we\u2019d made so far, I chose to shut up. He glanced down, as if he could see my carefully bandaged hand through the table, despite the fact that I\u2019d kept it folded in my lap and out of his sight. It seemed rude, otherwise, like waving a Twinkie in front of someone on Atkins.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happened to your hand?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhy are you being so careful with it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d I said, tucking the injured hand under my jeans-clad leg.</p><p>His lips twitched in disapproval as he leaned forward, his voice sultry and persuasive. And I had to clamp my thighs together, because that was just unfair. \u201cMiss Puckett, do you honestly think I can\u2019t sense fresh blood? Even in an environment as foul as this, I can smell it on you. Frankly, its pleasant distraction is the only thing keeping me from losing my mind in this crowded restaurant. Now, be a good girl and show me your hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you trying to hypnotize me?\u201d I asked, my eye narrowed. \u201cVampires can do that, right? Control people like puppets? Are you going to make me cluck like a chicken in this foul, crowded restaurant?\u201d</p><p>For the first time, he gave me a true, sincere smile. It was as if the clouds parted, the room lit up, and I was able to see what Mr. Sutherland looked like when he was human. Well, human and in a really good mood.</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t have that particular gift. I am merely concerned about any tendencies you may have to injure yourself while I\u2019m asleep. Will I wake up tomorrow night to find you have knocked yourself unconscious against the steering wheel and veered into a river?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat won\u2019t happen,\u201d I grumbled. \u201cAgain.\u201d</p><p>His jaw dropped.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m kidding!\u201d I exclaimed, laughing as I held up my hand. \u201cI caught my fingertip in the lock of a bathroom stall. It sort of snipped the tiniest bit of the fingertip off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat cannot possibly be true.\u201d</p><p>I held the finger up for his inspection. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason we carry a suitcase-sized first-aid kit in the backseat. I manage to injure myself in increasingly inventive ways. I\u2019ve been burned by a peanut salesman with bad aim at a Cubs game. I got a jellyfish stuck in my bikini top in Jamaica, which required some interesting ointment placement. Once my fian\u2014a friend was opening a bottle of champagne in the next room, and the cork ricocheted around a corner, off the ceiling, and hit me right in the eye. I had a shiner for a week. My neighbor slipped brochures for a women\u2019s shelter under my door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re exaggerating,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWould you like me to show you the scars?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cWhere exactly are these scars?\u201d</p><p>Was I suffering from a French-fry-induced high, or was Mr. Sutherland flirting with me?</p><p>I grinned cheekily, trailing my (uninjured) fingertips along the buttons of my blouse, as if I was considering loosening them. His blue eyes tracked the motion of my hand, up and down, up and down. I stopped abruptly, and he shook his head, as if clearing it from some fog.</p><p>\u201cOn second thought, a lady needs to keep a bit of mystery about her,\u201d I said, lifting my sandwich from the plate and taking a bite.</p><p>Mr. Sutherland seemed deflated at my sudden change in course, which was a balm for my ego. He sighed, toying with a packet of Splenda. \u201cOh, trust me, Miss Puckett, you are an enigma.\u201d</p><p>We came so close to having a pleasant evening. Mr. Sutherland even managed to restrain his comments when I ordered a slice of lemon meringue pie, although I\u2019m sure it smelled awful to him. I stopped badgering him with questions and made light conversation about our schedule for the next night. We walked out of the diner, and he actually opened the door for me with a little smile on his face.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that heavy to cart around with you everywhere we go?\u201d I asked, nudging the silver briefcase with my fingers.</p><p>He gently spanked my hand away. \u201cWhat did we say about touching the case?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid we say, \u2018If you smack my hand again, I will wedgie you until your underwear comes up over your head\u2019?\u201d</p><p>He gave me an arch look.</p><p>\u201cI would try,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>I\u2019d parked on the far side of the parking lot, beyond the truckers\u2019 area, because I wanted to give us some space if Mr. Sutherland needed to do something vampire-y. Also, the last thing I needed to do was ding some tourist\u2019s car. But as we walked to the car, I could see from a distance that was the least of my concerns. There was something on the hood. Weird, circular shapes with\u2014</p><p>\u201cOh, for the love of Pete!\u201d I cried.</p><p>Someone had spray-painted a pair of neon pink breasts on the hood of the car. Big, round, obscenely realistic breasts that were most likely visible from space. I glanced around the parking lot and saw that ours was not the only vehicle to receive a makeover. A Ryder moving truck, a tractor-trailer, and a minivan were all decorated with twin sets of their very own. I noticed that each was parked in a dimly lit area of the lot, giving the vandals the cover of darkness. I scanned the lot for signs of the kids\u2014please, Lord, let this be the work of teenagers and not grown men\u2014but couldn\u2019t see so much as a mist of spray paint. The phantom graffiti artists were long gone.</p><p>\u201cFuck a duck!\u201d I exclaimed.</p><p>\u201cLanguage,\u201d Mr. Sutherland admonished weakly. He was stricken, trying like hell, but failing, to avoid looking at the \u201cart.\u201d \u201cWas it like this before we went into the diner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I would have remembered our car having boobs,\u201d I said, staring down at the Batmobile\u2019s generous triple-Z cups. We were transfixed, caught in the thrall of trompe l\u2019oeil cleavage. That was a first for me.</p><p>Several awkward, silent moments passed. As I snapped shots of the hood for Iris\u2019s insurance agent\u2014and Mr. Sutherland\u2019s face, for posterity\u2014I considered several options. Calling Iris and telling her she would need to send the National Guard to retrieve Mr. Sutherland. Going back into the diner to inquire whether they served hard liquor. Attempting to paint over the boobs with black nail polish.</p><p>Hey, it worked when I scratched my mom\u2019s car in high school.</p><p>I realized that Mr. Sutherland had moved on from staring at the car to watching me intently. \u201cAre you waiting for me to know what to do here? Because this was not covered during my orientation.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShould we call the police and report this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you really want to file another police report? That will just slow us down that much more. We\u2019re running just shy of \u2018on time\u2019 as it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou make a good point.\u201d He nodded. \u201cWe\u2019ll just tell Miss Scanlon to add the cost of repainting the car to my bill.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReally?\u201d I asked, lifting a brow. \u201cThat\u2019s very nice of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cContingencies, Miss Puckett. They happen,\u201d he said, echoing my words earlier. \u201cParticularly when you\u2019re around. But you shouldn\u2019t be held responsible for the actions of mammary-minded juvenile delinquents.\u201d</p><p>I searched his face for some hint of derision or deception. I found none, just unearthly blue eyes and an unsettling amount of sincerity. He really wasn\u2019t angry or annoyed with me. He was incredibly embarrassed, however, and trying very hard not to look me directly in the eye.</p><p>Men, vampire or otherwise, were so strange when it came to boobs.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps we can paint over the, er, additions with black paint so it\u2019s less noticeable.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI thought about it, but adding another layer might make it harder for the professionals to fix. I\u2019ll call Iris in the morning and ask her if we have some sort of vandalism roadside-assistance plan,\u201d I said. \u201cLet\u2019s just get on the road, shall we?\u201d</p><p>I reached into the car and popped the hood. As I propped it back over the windshield, Mr. Sutherland frowned. \u201cI don\u2019t think this is the best way to keep other drivers from seeing them, Miss Puckett, unless you plan to cut eyeholes in the hood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny.\u201d I snorted. \u201cI just want to make sure our friendly neighborhood car decorators didn\u2019t diddle with my engine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDiddle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would use the f-word again, but cursing seems to upset you,\u201d I said, peering down at the gleaming inner works of the car.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t this just a bit paranoid?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt might be, if I hadn\u2019t been stranded outside a mall in Poughkeepsie once, believing my car was completely dead, only to find out that some smartass had taken advantage of a faulty outside hood latch and unscrewed my distributor cap. The tow-truck guy laughed his ass off at me. So now, I just like to make sure everything\u2019s in order.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Sutherland peered over my shoulder. \u201cDo you know what you\u2019re looking at?\u201d</p><p>I cut my eyes at him. \u201cWould you ask a man that same question?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, because I have no clue what I\u2019m looking at.\u201d He looked affronted, which made me laugh, despite the situation. \u201cWhy would said smartass do something like that?\u201d he asked as I checked the obvious spots, the spark plugs, the alternator, the battery cables.</p><p>\u201cI think I was being set up for a mugging in Poughkeepsie, but the tow truck got there before anything could happen. But in this case, I don\u2019t know\u2014just in case the automotive boobs weren\u2019t demoralizing enough?\u201d</p><p>I gently nudged his hands out of the way before snapping the hood shut. Remembering the incident with the car door, he flexed his healed fingers. \u201cAre you demoralized?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding?\u201d I scoffed. \u201cThis is just Tuesday for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s Thursday.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s an expression.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know about engines?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI helped crew a yacht in the Caribbean one summer in college. I was friends with the ship\u2019s mechanic, and he taught me the basics. It comes in handy when you travel as much as I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do on the crew?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGeneral dogsbody. I ran lines, cleaned cabins, cooked on occasion. The yacht belonged to my very well-off roommate\u2019s dad, so he was pretty easy on us, on the rare occasions he was actually on the boat. It was one of the best summers of my life.\u201d</p><p>It was also the precursor to my dropping out of school after just one year. It turned out that returning for school two months into the semester was frowned upon in some academic circles. Who knew?</p><p>I cleaned my hands with some Wet Wipes as he climbed into the backseat. Sliding into the driver\u2019s seat, I turned toward him. \u201cLook, we\u2019re riding around in a car with tits. I think normal social constraints have gone out the window. Can you just call me by my first name? And sit up front?\u201d</p><p>He was silent while he mulled it over.</p><p>\u201cYou be nice, or I\u2019m going to set the station to Radio Disney and leave it there,\u201d I warned him.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d He climbed over the seat, unwilling to get out of the car, I supposed, just in case the gathering crowd had torches and pitchforks handy.</p><p>\u201cCould you take off the jacket and relax a little?\u201d I asked, reaching down to silence another of Jason\u2019s calls on my phone.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t push it,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cMiranda.\u201d</p><p>Despite myself\u2014and the enormous jugs on my hood\u2014I smiled as we pulled out of the parking lot and onto the highway.</p><p>LAID BARE ... AND NOT IN THE FUN WAY</p><p>5</p><p>Collin\u2014whom I was calling by his first name without explicit permission\u2014was surprisingly easy to talk to when he didn\u2019t have that enormous stick up his ass. I won\u2019t say that we had a life-altering, soul-baring exchange, but he managed not to lecture me when I left a soda cap in the console. And I didn\u2019t say a thing when he insisted on keeping the radio on the classical station. I considered that progress.</p><p>He was still as intimidating as ever, with the whole leisurely predator thing, lounging on the front seat in perfect, unwrinkled elegance while I drove. But he was attempting to make conversation, even if it was because he wanted to hear more of my embarrassing history.</p><p>\u201cTell me something,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re only twenty-three human years old?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be twenty-seven in March, but thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy does your family allow you to drift about the country in this fashion?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I laughed. \u201cThey hardly allow me to do anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen how are you supported?\u201d</p><p>I snorted. That was the million-dollar question. I\u2019d moved out of my apartment with Jason after the Lisa fiasco and was living with my parents again. I was still technically in the firm\u2019s employ, but even with the continual disasters we were suffering, I found that working for Iris was much more pleasant. I was more entertained on the road than in months at Puckett and Puckett. And that included the time one of my dad\u2019s clients tried to use an iguana as a character witness in a divorce trial.</p><p>There were too many strings attached to my parents\u2019 support, and most of those strings had hooks on them. I\u2019d known I was making a mistake, borrowing the money from them. After I dropped out, I was working two or three jobs to keep my head above water\u2014almost all of which ended in disaster. But when the studio deal presented itself, the temptation to be \u201clegitimate\u201d in my parents\u2019 eyes was too great. I wanted to do something that they would consider respectable, that didn\u2019t involve working for them. I\u2019d wanted what I wanted, right away, instead of waiting until I had enough credit to get a bank loan. So I took the easy way out. I wouldn\u2019t make that mistake again.</p><p>It\u2019s not that I didn\u2019t appreciate what they\u2019d done. And I understood that paying them back was the moral, responsible thing to do. Accepting that money meant losing my right to make decisions for myself, to live without my parents scrutinizing every decision I made. Every time I did something my parents didn\u2019t approve of, there was a comment about \u201call they\u2019d done for me.\u201d If I bought something frivolous, my dad reminded me of the balance due on the loan. Being with Jason had shielded me from all of that temporarily. Was I ready to go back to living without that protection?</p><p>And why was that the first thought I\u2019d devoted to Jason all day?</p><p>\u201cAre we going to talk about you anytime soon?\u201d I asked, clearly stalling. \u201cI\u2019d like to know more about this plane-crash thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a simple question, Miranda.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK, but we\u2019re coming back to you,\u201d I promised him.</p><p>\u201cMiranda.\u201d</p><p>I was enjoying the way he said my name just a little too much. I shook it off, waving the thrall of his voice away like smoke rings drifting around my head. There was no way I was going to admit to him that I worked for my mommy and daddy, so I hedged. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve noticed, but I work for a living. I am, in fact, working right now.\u201d</p><p>Unfazed by my snippy tone, he continued. \u201cMiss Scanlon mentioned that you were a recent hire. What did you do before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIris didn\u2019t mention?\u201d I asked, narrowing my eyes at him. Was this some sort of conversation setup? Had he become so irritated over the painted-boobs thing that he\u2019d decided to make me confess all of my professional dumbass-ery? Was he trying to prove something? Because I was not above tossing that cup of leftover coffee into his face.</p><p>Eyeing me carefully, he took the cup out of the console, opened the window, and dumped the coffee. He sealed the foam cup in the little trash bag he\u2019d insisted on after the Great Hamburger Wrapper Scandal. He looked really pleased with himself, smirking and crossing his arms over his chest. I arched my eyebrows. I scowled at him. How did he know? And why did he seem to think of coffee disposal as a personal triumph?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m only asking because I\u2019m curious,\u201d he assured me, holding up his hands defensively. \u201cHonestly, beyond your penchant for violence and preference for nutritionally bankrupt food, I know very little about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did lots of things,\u201d I said, vaguely ... and realized that made my history sound far more porn-ish than it was.</p><p>\u201cWhat was your last job before this one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, I told you I crewed a yacht that summer? It hit a commercial fishing boat and sank\u2014not when I was at the wheel, thank you very much. I worked at a camp for troubled kids, and I was actually pretty good at it. But the kitchen staff nearly killed some of the kids with food poisoning, and the camp was shut down. I was working to get my masseuse license through an on-the-job training program, but the cops closed the spa down because my coworker got handsy with a health inspector in the wrong anatomical area ... She was a little high at the time.\u201d</p><p>Collin\u2019s eyes grew wide. His mouth pinched itself together at the corners.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead and laugh.\u201d I sighed.</p><p>A hearty, braying cackle burst from his chest, doubling him over and startling me. My eyes went wide as he howled with laughter, clutching his sides as if he was using muscles that hadn\u2019t worked in years. It might have irritated the hell out of me, except that he looked so damn pretty when he did it. He continued to snicker until slightly pink tears ran down his cheeks. He wiped at them.</p><p>I grumbled. \u201cI left college, let\u2019s say, \u2018prematurely.\u2019 It wasn\u2019t a good fit for me, sitting in the same classrooms with the same people, day after day. I liked \u2018drifting about the country,\u2019 as you called it. I liked not knowing what I was going to do or who I was going to meet. I liked learning new skills. Every day should be an adventure, in my book, a whole new life to be lived. The karmic payoff to this \u2018shiftless nomadic existence that breaks my parents\u2019 hearts\u2019 is that every time I think I find something I\u2019m good at, it blows up in my face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am suddenly very, very afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it makes you feel any better, I don\u2019t usually take bystanders down with me.\u201d I added reluctantly, \u201cExcept for that one time with Morlock the Magician. Though, to be fair, he did tell me to coat the dove with glitter spray. It\u2019s not my fault he bought a highly flammable discount brand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat does not make me feel any better, no,\u201d he said, shaking his head. \u201cHighly flammable?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe bird got spooked during the Ring of Fire trick, then flew right at Morlock. Flaming bird, lots of stage makeup and hair spray. It took a whole fire extinguisher, and Morlock still had some third-degree burns.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd how did you escape this inferno?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe bird always liked Morlock better than me,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cYou know, the more you talk, the less secure I feel.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can promise not to try to kill you,\u201d I offered.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Hearing about my past misfortunes amused\u2014but frightened\u2014Collin to no end. It was sort of like telling a small child a ghost story. He wanted to be scared, even though he knew he was better off not knowing about my past. But I loved seeing that easy smile on his face, so I just kept sharing. Three hours and several spectacular firing stories later, we arrived at the Country Inn, the little roadside \u201cboutique hotel\u201d where Collin had booked us rooms.</p><p>\u201cThis does not look like the photos on the travel Web site,\u201d he said.</p><p>I looked up the hotel on my phone, finding the site that displayed pictures of the Country Inn ... from at least thirty years before. It was no longer \u201cclean, comfortable, and convenient\u201d as advertised. It was convenient because the highway practically ran through the parking lot. That was all the place had going for it. I think the owner called it a boutique hotel because there was a sex-toy shop right next door. The building had that same desperate, beaten look as our motel from the night before. The same rust stains. The same \u201cTruckers Welcome\u201d sign.</p> <p>\u201cWe could keep going,\u201d I suggested.</p><p>\u201cNo, I need a break from the car. And you need your rest. I can tell you\u2019re getting tired. Frankly, with your background, I worry about your reflexes under normal, nonfatigued circumstances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice. Your turn talking tomorrow night, got it? There have to be some embarrassing incidents from your colonial days. A pantaloons malfunction, something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been very generous with your history,\u201d he conceded.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not an answer,\u201d I retorted. \u201cAre you coming in with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter the diner, I think I\u2019ll stay out in the car,\u201d he said.</p> <p>I walked into the motel office and did a mental \u201cRun-down Motel Requirement\u201d checklist. Rattling space heater? Check. Dust-covered plastic houseplant? Check. Credit-card acceptance signs showing logos abandoned by the companies in the 1970s? Check.</p><p>The clerk was a middle-aged blond man in a pressed blue polo shirt and wire-rim glasses. I couldn\u2019t figure out how he\u2019d managed to end up behind that desk. And I don\u2019t think he had figured it out, either. Maybe this was his second job, the one that paid for the questionable Internet online orders he didn\u2019t want his wife to find out about?</p><p>The clerk was on the phone, apparently on hold, all the while ignoring the drunk swaying in front of the check-in desk.</p><p>\u201cI just need a room, damn it,\u201d the drunk slurred, sweat rolling from the thinning hair on the back of his head, dripping down his neck, and soaking into the cheap pea-green suit he was wearing. He smelled like a brewery. I was sincerely glad that he was facing away and I was out of his line-of-breath. \u201cGot a cute little thing waitin\u2019 outside, and I don\u2019t want to lose her.\u201d</p><p>Nice. This guy had clearly met his soul mate on a nearby street corner. I checked the desk for an \u201cHourly rates\u201d sign and was relieved that I didn\u2019t see one.</p><p>\u201cLook, man, I\u2019m sorry, the credit-card company has me on hold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust run the card again,\u201d the drunk demanded.</p><p>The clerk cradled the receiver on his shoulder and glanced at me. \u201cYeah, can I help you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI need two rooms, please,\u201d I said, putting my license and credit card on the counter. I silently prayed that there was enough room on the balance to allow the charge. And that the clerk didn\u2019t steal my identity to buy equipment for his gaming system.</p><p>He gave me an apologetic little shrug, checking my ID and placing my card next to his computer keyboard. \u201cIt will be just a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, I got a little hottie out in the car, I need a room,\u201d the drunk slurred. His bleary brown eyes settled on me and gave me a moist, crooked smile. \u201cHey there, cutie. You lookin\u2019 to party? You could join us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, come on, honey,\u201d the drunk whined, leering at me. \u201cI\u2019d show you a real good time.\u201d</p><p>He lurched toward me, giving me what I\u2019m sure was supposed to be his best smile. I leaned in closer and in my most menacing voice whispered, \u201cIf you so much as breathe on me again, I will crush you like a bug, little man.\u201d</p><p>The drunk pouted, stumbling back a few steps.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, what is the problem?\u201d the clerk asked the person on the other end of the line. He rolled his eyes and picked up a pair of wicked-looking scissors the size of hedge clippers. \u201cAll right, I\u2019ll do that.\u201d</p><p>The clerk hung up the phone and sighed.</p><p>\u201cMr. Reynolds, I have bad news for you. The card company has requested that I destroy your card.\u201d The clerk picked up the card nearest to his hand and snipped it with a decisive snick! He ruthlessly sliced through the card, raining shards of plastic on the desk like red metallic snowflakes.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d the drunk shouted. \u201cWhat\u2019d you do that for?\u201d</p><p>I tried to look away, eager just to finish my transaction and get out of the office. Because as amusing as it was to see Drunky Drunkerson\u2019s credit card snipped, I just wanted to get some sleep.</p><p>\u201cOh, wait,\u201d the drunk mumbled. \u201cNever mind.\u201d</p><p>I glanced over and saw an unfamiliar Visa card on the counter. The bits of plastic on the counter, however, were a familiar color.</p><p>\u201cCan I have my card back now?\u201d the drunk asked, just as I demanded, \u201cWhere\u2019s my card?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, shit,\u201d the clerk said, looking stricken.</p><p>\u201cYou destroyed my card!\u201d I cried.</p><p>\u201cI-I must have switched them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I yelled as the drunk with the useless, but intact, card ambled away. \u201cNo, no, no, no!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, look, I\u2019m sorry, but don\u2019t overreact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOverreact?\u201d I yelled, grabbing the stapler from the ledge of his desk. \u201cThis isn\u2019t overreacting! Stapling your collar to the desk, that would be overreacting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPut down my stapler. I don\u2019t want to have to call the cops.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall them. It will be justifiable homicide!\u201d I snapped.</p><p>\u201cOK, let\u2019s just calm down. What has you so upset?\u201d</p><p>I took a deep, shuddering breath through my nose and focused on not murdering someone who was probably a very nice person when he wasn\u2019t destroying my only financial lifeline. \u201cI\u2019m upset because you just murdered my only credit card, my only form of legal tender. It will take me at least a week to get a replacement card. I am on the road for work, stuck five hundred miles from home, without a credit card. And I still need a place to sleep for the night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I can give you one room,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the least I can do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne?\u201d I growled.</p><p>He winced, stepping back away from the desk. \u201cLook, honey, I\u2019ve got a boss, just like you. I can hide one room on the night audit, but two? That\u2019s pushing it.\u201d</p><p>I glared at him, but no amount of stink-eye would persuade him. \u201cFine, fine, just let me have whatever you\u2019ve got.\u201d</p><p>I snatched the flimsy plastic key card from his hand and swept out of the office. The clerk called after me to remember that I had to be out of the room by eleven, as if I was going to linger in the morning.</p><p>I gritted my teeth, clutching the key card until the edges bit into my palm. What the hell was I going to do? I had the fleet card for gas and maybe enough cash to keep me in food until we pulled into the Half-Moon Hollow town limits. We had enough blood to keep Collin fed for three nights. But that was it\u2014that was the full extent of our resources, which scared the hell out of me. We wouldn\u2019t be able to withstand any more \u201cincidents\u201d without help from Iris.</p><p>And if I called Iris for help, she\u2019d probably hop on a plane to complete the drive with Collin herself. I\u2019d be fired. I\u2019d be lucky if I got a ride home. Actually, I\u2019d be lucky if she didn\u2019t tie me to the hood of the Batmobile like a deer for the drive home.</p><p>I needed more time. I hadn\u2019t thought about Jason or the wedding or my future in Half-Moon Hollow all damn day. That wasn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing. My brain had needed the time off from the constant whir of Jason-related worries over the past few months. But I was no closer to making a decision than when I\u2019d departed the Hollow. I wasn\u2019t ready to go back home yet. I needed to complete this job on time, not just because I needed the time away but also to prove to myself that I wasn\u2019t a complete idiot.</p><p>\u201cIs everything all right?\u201d Collin asked as I approached the Batmobile. \u201cYou look rather distressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I said, smiling thinly as I popped open the rear hatch. \u201cIt\u2019s just ... the hotel only had one room available.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d he asked, scanning the parking lot, which was mostly empty.</p><p>\u201cA lot of the rooms are being fumigated,\u201d I told him, knowing that mentioning potential infestations was a calculated risk, given his penchant for cleanliness.</p><p>\u201cAre you trying to take advantage of me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, it sounds bad,\u201d I admitted. \u201cIt\u2019s our only option at this point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t have to sleep,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll make use of the bathing facilities and read while you sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sure, that won\u2019t make me uncomfortable at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would feel better if you weren\u2019t left unattended, anyway,\u201d he admitted as he carefully lifted the silver case from the backseat. \u201cWho knows what sort of trouble you would drum up out of boredom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still not going to tell me what\u2019s in that case, are you?\u201d</p><p>He frowned, an expression of honest regret, and said, \u201cI would, but I can\u2019t. I promised Ophelia I would keep it confidential. And because this trip is an effort to repay her for forgiving a small ... indiscretion I committed years ago, I can\u2019t afford to fail her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, but if I find out you\u2019re hauling Marcellus Wallace\u2019s soul around in that thing, I\u2019m going to be pissed,\u201d I griped as we carried our overnight bags into the room.</p><p>He didn\u2019t laugh at my Pulp Fiction reference. But he was kind enough to ignore the graffiti on the walls and the questionable carpet stains. The room was truly depressing, with faded greenish carpet, water-stained wallpaper, and a bedspread the color of medical waste.</p><p>\u201cSurely this isn\u2019t the best room they had to offer,\u201d he said.</p><p>I snorted, waving my arm at the splendor before us. \u201cOh, no, this is the honeymoon suite.\u201d</p><p>Overhead, we heard the din of male voices, talking over one another, laughing in that way only the truly inebriated can master. It sounded as if there were twenty of them, shoved into the room above ours.</p><p>\u201cThis is not going to be a restful evening, is it?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>While Collin was in the shower, I made a call to Iris. She did not have any suggestions for how to address our car\u2019s recent \u201cblossoming,\u201d but her teenage sister, Gigi, found a lot of humor in the situation.</p><p>\u201cHave you thought about spray-painting a bikini top over them?\u201d Gigi asked.</p><p>\u201cYou are so not helping,\u201d I grumbled. \u201cStupid speakerphone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGigi, stop teasing her,\u201d Iris chided, yawning. \u201cMiranda, honey, don\u2019t do anything to it. I know it\u2019s probably embarrassing to drive around with them, but trying paint remover or adding another layer of paint will just make the situation worse. And don\u2019t try to duct-tape cardboard over it. The tape residue will just cause more problems. When you get back to town, we\u2019ll take care of it. Until then, just stick to the back roads ... and avoid church buses ... and school buses basically, all forms of mass transit.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd don\u2019t beat yourself up over it,\u201d she told me. \u201cI parked my van outside Jane\u2019s bookshop a while ago, and someone painted \u2018VAMPIRE BITCH\u2019 across the hood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s hurtful and inaccurate.\u201d</p> <p>She hummed in agreement. \u201cI had to leave it that way for a week until I could get it fixed. I got some really funny looks at Walmart. Just be more careful about where you park from now on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd stop calling me ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo how are things going with the mysterious Mr. Sutherland?\u201d</p> <p>This was the question I was dreading. I ended up forcing the words out in a rush. \u201cFine. It was a little rough at the start, but I think we\u2019ve come to an understanding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas he lightened up at all on the contract rider and all of those rules?\u201d she asked. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to have put that on you, but he wouldn\u2019t sign without it, and Ophelia was insistent that she didn\u2019t trust anyone but Beeline to transport him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he definitely likes his own way. But he\u2019s stopped being downright hostile. And at least he\u2019s not asking me to separate his M&amp;M\u2019s by color.\u201d</p><p>She groaned. \u201cYour next assignment will be driving fluffy kittens to an amusement park, I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now I\u2019m worried about why vampires would need fluffy kittens.\u201d I shuddered.</p><p>\u201cNo other problems beyond the spray paint?\u201d</p> <p>I cleared my throat. This was why I didn\u2019t gamble. I had no poker face, and I tended to hem and haw. Would this be a good time to bring up the other problems? Iris had been downright reasonable about the chicken thing and the boob thing, but would that change when it was compounded with the rednecks, the money issues, and seedy motels? I\u2019d basically put her client through a more perverse, less fun version of a National Lampoon\u2019s Vacation.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said before my stupid conscience got a vote. I hated lying to Iris, but I hated the idea of filing and fetching my brother\u2019s coffee more. And that\u2019s where I\u2019d end up if I couldn\u2019t pay off my loan.</p><p>\u201cGood. Check in with me tomorrow night, would you?\u201d</p><p>I agreed and gave her a heads-up on the amount of gas I\u2019d put on the fleet card so far. She waved off the total as if it was nothing and told me to take care of myself and try to have some fun on the road, to get enough sleep and non-fast food. I stared at the phone in my hand. That was unusual. An employer who put her employees ahead of the bottom line? I could get used to that.</p><p>Steeling my nerves, I opened my voicemail and found I had eleven messages from Jason, only five of which Jason was aware he\u2019d left. In between messages in which I heard him order coffee, mutter to himself about a faulty fax machine, and make closing arguments in an attempted murder case, Jason told me how much he wanted me home with him. He said the house didn\u2019t smell the same anymore, no more pies in the oven, no hints of my perfume. He hated sleeping alone. He hated showering without someone trying to talk to him around the curtain.</p><p>Jason loved me. The thought of losing me scared him too much, he said. He promised he wouldn\u2019t see Lisa again, even if it meant awkward moments with her or her family, longtime friends of the Cordners. He wanted to start over. He loved me, he insisted, and he wanted to make a life with me, even if he hadn\u2019t worked through his feelings for Lisa. He hadn\u2019t meant to hurt me, he said. Lisa was there to listen to him, as always, and things went too far. It hadn\u2019t meant anything.</p><p>That last reference had me pausing. It brought back all of those crazy \u201creality-show wench\u201d feelings. How far exactly had \u201cthings\u201d gone? Had he lied about that, too? I mean, he told me that he and Lisa were \u201cjust friends,\u201d like brother and sister. And as far I knew, brothers and sisters did not exchange steamy confessions of love via text message. Had they been sleeping together this whole time? Was it really better if they hadn\u2019t? Why was I sort of OK with Jason thinking he might be in love with another woman, but the thought of him having sex with her made me want to attack him with a farm implement?</p><p>\u201cStop it,\u201d I told myself. \u201cTorturing yourself isn\u2019t going to do you any good.\u201d</p> <p>I rubbed a hand over my face. I felt better after getting off the phone, even if I had withheld quite a bit of information from Iris, and was once again plagued with visions of Jason and Lisa playing naked Twister. If nothing else, the call made me more determined to keep my job with Iris. I liked working for her. Sure, this assignment had been a twitching nightmare, but she said the next one would be easier. I would find a way to make it up to her, I decided. I would get up early, drive like hell the next two nights, and get Collin to the Hollow well before the deadline, even if it killed me.</p><p>I really hoped it didn\u2019t kill me.</p><p>The shower was still running when I stepped into the room. Collin\u2019s overnight case was left outside the door. I didn\u2019t have the energy for that, so I slid on some blue plaid boy shorts and a tank top and flopped onto the stiff, crunchy tan bedspread. This outfit was not exactly appropriate work wear, but I hadn\u2019t been expecting nighttime \u201ccompany.\u201d And I wasn\u2019t about to sleep in jeans.</p><p>When the water shut off with a protesting squeak, I nearly jumped out of my skin. I turned on the lumpy bed, realizing that the bathroom door was standing open. Collin stepped out of the shower, wrapping a towel around his waist.</p><p>Good Lord.</p><p>Pale skin, miles of it, perfect and smooth. A little metal key hung from a slim chain around his neck. He had a swimmer\u2019s body, lean, rangy, with long legs. His feet were slender and highly arched. Water dripped down the muscled contours of his back, toward a butt that\u2014</p><p>That settled it. I was jealous of a towel.</p><p>I did my best to look away. I didn\u2019t even want to admit that I wanted to look. A little flirtation at dinner was one thing, but I would not let him know that seeing him swathed in a threadbare towel was possibly the best sexual experience I\u2019d had in more than a year. I had to maintain some dignity. He shot a startled glance into the bedroom, as if he hadn\u2019t expected me to be there.</p><p>\u201cApologies,\u201d he said, grabbing his overnight case and snapping the door shut.</p><p>My jaw dropped. What the hell? He was a vampire. Vampires did not get distracted. They didn\u2019t just forget that there was a beating human heart pumping the scent of their favorite food into the next room. Had he left the door open on purpose? Was he trying to torture me?</p><p>I grabbed my lip balm and paperback out of my bag, knowing full well that I wouldn\u2019t read before I went to sleep. But it was my nightly ritual, and it had to be respected. I was standing by the bed, debating whether it was grosser to sleep on the comforter or to risk bedbug bites by climbing under the sheets, when the door swung open again. Collin emerged, damp hair curling slightly at the ends, a plume of steam following him out of the bathroom like something out of a Whitesnake video.</p><p>He was wearing another suit, black this time, with a crisp blue shirt. And because I was suddenly very self-conscious about my work-inappropriate sleepwear, I yanked back the covers and slid between the sheets.</p><p>Shudder.</p><p>\u201cSo do you own a pair of jeans?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cWhy would I wear jeans and T-shirts when the clothing I wear suits me so much better?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cTouch\u00e9,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>There was a loud thump from the room above ours and a chorus of drunken laughter. I heard the opening bars of \u201cGangsta\u2019s Paradise\u201d blare though the floor. Tiny sprinkles of ceiling dust drifted down like carcinogenic snow. As the bass line picked up, the snow flurries graduated to large flakes of paint.</p><p>I sighed and pulled the sheet over my face. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>I made a little peephole in the threadbare fabric so I could peer out. Collin pulled the bare wooden chair away from the battered desk, wiped it clean with a handkerchief, and settled in with a book. I punched a pillow the thickness of a maxi pad into shape and propped my head against it. I pretended not to notice that he\u2019d propped his feet on the bed, that they were inches away from own. The mattress sagged and shifted underneath me as I flopped back and forth like a fish, trying to find a comfortable position.</p><p>\u201cI thought you were tired,\u201d he said blandly as I fidgeted under the covers.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m exhausted, but I can\u2019t sleep,\u201d I whined, throwing the covers back and picking up my book. \u201cThis bed is like something out of \u2018The Princess and the Pea.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that a veiled request for a bedtime story?\u201d</p><p>I wondered briefly if that meant I could crawl into his lap. Because if so, I was onboard.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you reading?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCatch-22,\u201d I said, showing him the cover.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a rather bleak story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about someone in a no-win situation of his own creation. I can relate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you often read such nihilistic works?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I read a little bit of everything. Mysteries, fantasy, horror, romances\u2014except for bodice rippers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeg pardon?\u201d</p><p>I propped myself on my elbows. \u201cHistorical romances. You know, the swashbuckling pirate hero wants his lady so badly that he just rips the bodice of her gown open to access her bosoms.\u201d</p><p>He snickered derisively. \u201cThat\u2019s bloody ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I can\u2019t believe I said bosoms, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, speaking as someone with experience, you can\u2019t just rip bodices open,\u201d he insisted rather indignantly. \u201cIt takes time and patience and, in some cases, a small, deftly maneuvered blade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I asked, wiggling my eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cI was known to mangle a few bodices in my day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet you did, you libertine, you.\u201d I chuckled.</p><p>\u201cDo you read often?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhenever I can. Most nights, I can\u2019t go to sleep unless I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt seems out of character. You\u2019re always running, running, running,\u201d he said. \u201cFrankly, I can\u2019t believe you\u2019ve been still this long. I feel I must sit here and witness such a miracle of behavioral suppression.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour plan is to sit there and stare at me until sunup?\u201d I asked. \u201cNot creepy at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a book,\u201d he said, waving the thick linen-bound volume at me.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a book on taxidermy, is it? 101 Ways to Display the Corpses of Humans Who Annoy You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d He opened it, licking a finger before carefully selecting a page. He added softly, \u201cI left that particular title at home.\u201d</p><p>I barked out a laugh, flopping onto my other side to try to evade the weird dent in the middle of the mattress. It felt as if it might drop out from under me at any\u2014</p><p>Ker-RAANK!</p><p>The metal leg supporting the foot of the bed bent and collapsed, and I slid to the end of the mattress with a thump. Groaning, I climbed up the mattress, only to slide right back down so my feet touched the floor. Accepting that I would have to sleep at a twenty-degree angle, I pulled the blanket over my arms and made the best of it.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t laugh,\u201d I grunted into the pillow.</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t dream of it.\u201d</p><p>MC HAMMER RUINS AN OTHERWISE PLEASANT EVENING</p><p>6</p><p>I\u2019d almost dozed off when the dancing started. I didn\u2019t know people still danced to \u201cU Can\u2019t Touch This.\u201d But when they did, it caused a lot of damage. The paint drifted down from the ceiling in a near blizzard. The dusty domed light fixture above my head rattled like a loose pot lid. I watched, mesmerized by its rhythmic jiggle.</p><p>Suddenly, Collin shot to his feet.</p><p>I blinked blearily at him. \u201cWhat\u2014\u201d</p><p>He dove for me, sliding his arms under me and rolling off the bed. We landed on the floor with an \u201cOof!\u201d OK, the \u201cOof!\u201d was mine, after Collin landed on top of me. After the initial breathless shock of the landing, I froze. His nose was a few scant inches from mine. I could practically feel his eyelashes brushing against my cheeks as he gazed down at me, lips slightly parted. I could smell the strange mix of herbs, citrus, and mint on his skin, the cool sweetness of his breath. A rush of blood heated my skin, drawing his fangs out with a little snick as the blush spread to my chest. He seemed to be able to track its progress with his eyes, trailing down to my heart and watching it pulse beneath the skin. I squirmed under the weight of his hips wedged between my thighs. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His nostrils flared as he inched closer, a purring noise rumbling from his chest and through my own. His lips traced a cool path down my jugular, and my eyes rolled up, just catching sight of a huge black spider scuttling under the bed. Acute arachnophobia snapped me out of my hormone-fueled daze.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d I yelped, just as the glass globe from the light fixture dropped and shattered against the bed, right where my head had rested just a minute before. Collin threw his arm over my head as glass tinkled down against his shoulders, the carpet around our heads.</p><p>\u201cIt worked!\u201d he exclaimed, grinning down at me. It was like the moon breaking through storm clouds, white and brilliant and welcome. His eyes slid down my skin to assess any damage.</p> <p>\u201cYes, throwing me to the ground was a very effective method of getting me out of bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, the light, I saw it\u2014\u201d He seemed so relieved that a tacky light fixture had nearly crashed into my head. \u201cI saw it.\u201d</p><p>My brow furrowed. \u201cI\u2019m ... glad?\u201d</p><p>He grinned down at me, and suddenly, I was acutely aware of the fact that he was sprawled between my unclad thighs. The silky fabric of his suit chafed pleasantly against my skin as his legs tangled with mine. He leaned in close, the faintest stirring of air against my lips.</p><p>He leaned down, brushing his lips across mine tentatively, then pulling my lip into his mouth.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I blurted out.</p><p>He drew back. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were kissing me,\u201d I said, almost as shocked as I was amused. His mouth dropped open, and he was about to protest. \u201cIf you try to pretend you weren\u2019t, I will lose all respect for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I was kissing you, you would know,\u201d he said solemnly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, I hallucinated it,\u201d I shot back.</p><p>Lightning-fast, he struck, claiming my mouth with his. I felt the prick of his fangs as he worried my lip between his teeth. I moaned into his mouth, the cool slide of flesh over cool flesh. My fingers curled around his nape, feathering through the soft dark hair there. I tentatively swept the tip of my tongue against his lip and tasted the tangy sweetness of his mouth. He eagerly parted his lips and let his tongue dance with mine. His hands skimmed the length of my body, resting on my hips, tilted them to match his own.</p> <p>His hands slid under my butt, and he ground down. I hummed pleasantly around his tongue and felt a responding purr building in his chest. He was so cool to the touch. I expected him to be cold, hard, but this was such a soothing contrast to the heat of my own body. I flexed under him, just for the pleasure of feeling his skin slide against mine. He groaned and held me still with a quick grip of my hips.</p><p>His mouth broke away from mine. \u201cYou really are the most interesting girl, did you realize?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cI defy you to find anyone more interesting than me.\u201d</p><p>He grinned again and traced my uninjured fingers over his cheeks to his lips. He pressed the tip of one between his teeth and gently bit down, drawing a bit of blood. It seeped into his mouth, and I could feel every bump of his sandpaper tongue against the pad of my digit. With each draw against the wound, a strange pulsing energy edged up from between my thighs. I moaned, throwing my head back and grinding my hips up against him. The pulsing became a rolling riptide, dragging me over the edge\u2014</p><p>Too much, too much, too much! my brain screamed at me.</p><p>What was I doing? What the hell was I thinking? Although we were on a break, so to speak, I was still technically involved with Jason. And if I got mad at him for cheating on me \u201cemotionally\u201d with Lisa, I couldn\u2019t in good conscience get all grindy with Collin.</p><p>Hell, what I was doing was worse. Jason seemed to have genuine feelings for Lisa. All I had for Collin were neuron-frying lust and the tender, green beginnings of mutual respect. Maybe this was some sort of Stockholm syndrome? I was stuck in increasingly bizarre situations with Collin, so I bonded to him emotionally? Maybe it was my brain\u2019s way of preventing a total psychological break.</p><p>Then again, considering that it was Collin who kissed me, maybe he was having the break. What was he thinking? The man who sneered at my \u201climitations\u201d twenty-four hours ago couldn\u2019t be the same guy who pinned me to the floor and kissed the hell out of me. Why was he doing this? Did he really like me, or did my employment stories make him feel sorry for me? Was this a pity kiss?</p> <p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll take that shower now,\u201d I whispered, easing my fingers away from his mouth.</p><p>He frowned, looking me over. \u201cDo you have glass in your hair?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but we\u2019ve had contact with the carpet.\u201d I gave an exaggerated shiver.</p><p>He smiled again and helped me to my feet. I scampered across the stained, glittering rug and locked myself in the cramped little bathroom. It still smelled like the herbal shampoo he used. It seemed so strange, after spending the last day at such a distance, to share a relatively intimate space. It was downright domestic, his Fang-Brite Mouthwash on the counter next to my toothbrush. My little bottles of toiletries in the shower next to his. I shook off these pointless musings and doused my head.</p><p>The cooling shower helped me focus my thoughts. Kissing Collin, as wonderful as it had been, was a huge mistake. Nothing good could come of it. Leaving off the complications to my already conscience-boggling relationship with Jason and the potential professional ass whipping I would take if Iris found out, it wasn\u2019t as if Mr. Sixteen-Page Contract Rider would want anything but a one-night stand with me. And that would most likely be for the sake of bragging rights with his fellow uptight ancients: \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t believe the walk on the wild side I took with this spazzy little human who couldn\u2019t walk across a parking lot unscathed.\u201d</p><p>I shampooed aggressively, which is always a mistake. I ended up with dried-out hair and an empty bottle of shampoo. I combed through my wet tangle of hair, carefully moisturizing and applying a raspberry-scented lotion.</p><p>I would put a stop to this, even if it meant a return to cranky, stern Mr. Sutherland. I would be sensible, for once in my life. I would be professional, discreet. I would stop letting the client suck on my fingers.</p><p>I slipped back into the shorts and tank, combing through my wet hair and brushing my teeth far more vigorously than I usually did. Curious, I lifted the top of the Fang-Brite Mouthwash, suddenly very self-conscious about the state of my breath. I sniffed. It smelled just like any market-brand mouthwash. I took a little swig ... and immediately coughed it right into the sink.</p><p>It was like minty-fresh battery acid! I cupped my hand under the faucet, spooning it into my mouth and rinsing thoroughly. I checked the mirror to make sure my teeth hadn\u2019t melted away. They were present ... and a little whiter. Clearly, vampire teeth were made of stronger stuff than mine.</p><p>Note to self: Vampire products are for vampires only.</p><p>I straightened the towels, knowing that leaving them askew would drive Collin nuts, and decluttered the bathroom before emerging. He was standing right outside the door, making me yelp in surprise and nearly slip on the wet tile. His hand shot out and caught me before I landed on my butt.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I demanded. I glanced down at the worn brown leather journal in his hand. My worn brown leather journal. He was looking through my photos again. \u201cWhat is it with you and that journal? Has it occurred to you that you should ask before you go rifling through someone\u2019s stuff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s intriguing,\u201d he said, holding the book open to a page showing a picture of the sunrise over the Atlantic City Boardwalk. I remembered waiting for that shot, holding my breath until the exact moment the sun rose over the water and set it on fire with flickers of gold and red. \u201cDid you take all of the photos yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat explains the whirring and clicking I heard at the diner. Did you take my picture when my eyes were closed?\u201d</p><p>I smirked a little and notched my chin up a bit. \u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very good, a keen eye for dramatic composition. I haven\u2019t seen the sunrise in more than a century, but I feel as if I\u2019m there. I can feel the sun on my face ... without the sensation of my flesh bursting into flame.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a plus,\u201d I agreed. I pushed past him, taking my journal with me, only to find that he had cleared out the glass-littered bedspread, propped up the bent bed leg, and put the room to rights. \u201cThanks for fixing the bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI called the front desk. The clerk was more than willing to let me vacuum up the mess myself. Unfortunately, the party upstairs seems to be a stag night for the manager\u2019s cousin. So the noise levels won\u2019t be lowering anytime soon. Also, the clerk mentioned something about beggars can\u2019t be choosers? Do you know what that means?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I shook my head, shrugging. \u201cThe noise is OK, actually. It reminds me of when I lived in Detroit, above this noodle shop and karaoke bar. Awesome mai fun. Baaaad impersonations of Britney Spears.\u201d</p><p>I slid into the bed and tried not to think about the relative cleanliness of the sheets. Collin settled into his chair and propped his feet on the bed.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know about the light fixture?\u201d</p><p>He pursed his lips as he turned the page of his book. \u201cIt\u2019s not important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I muttered. Unreasonably irritated by this response, I rolled away from him and pulled the blankets up to my chin. \u201cGood night, Collin.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes, letting the weight of exhaustion drag me into soft, dark near-unconsciousness.</p><p>\u201cI see glimpses.\u201d</p><p>My eyes snapped open at the sound of his voice. I propped myself up on my elbows, blinking at him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see glimpses of the future. That\u2019s what I meant earlier by \u2018it worked.\u2019 It\u2019s been days since it\u2019s worked properly. I finally got a quick impression, and it was you, getting pelted with broken glass from the broken fixture. I believe it was because you were finally still, not able to make plans or decisions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne, that\u2019s kind of a dickish thing to say. And two, thank you for saving me from a face full of broken glass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very welcome. I quite like your face. I would like it to remain intact.\u201d</p><p>Lord help me, I actually blushed and struggled for something to say. All I could come up with was, \u201cSo you\u2019re psychic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly vaguely, but over time, I\u2019ve seen the signs of events and can interpret a larger picture. After a while, all of the possible scenarios seem repetitive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s how you knew to throw the coffee out the window earlier?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cNo, you were eyeing that cup and my face in a way that could only mean injury for me.\u201d</p><p>I sat up, facing him. \u201cIs that why you try so hard to control your environment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery choice, every change in plans, every shift in direction is a chance for different outcomes. I see them all. If I allow too many of those variables, the effect is disorienting and overwhelming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why you try so hard to avoid contact with people? To avoid being overwhelmed?\u201d I guessed. \u201cAnd what does that have to do with your anti-fast-food-wrapper obsession?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, frankly, I find the idea of leaving week-old food wrappers in your car to be pointless and disgusting,\u201d he told me. \u201cBut there are other issues. The more cluttered an environment, the more likely it is that an accident will occur. If there are too many potential outcomes in a situation, it can become disorienting for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if you can see an accident coming, how did you end up in a plane crash?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t see it coming,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d flown a handful of times without problems. I didn\u2019t see anything going awry when we boarded. And then, an hour into the flight, the pilot was offered a piece of candy. It was an impulsive gesture from a copilot who normally didn\u2019t like to share. The candy had nuts in it, which caused a violent allergic reaction in the pilot\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd that crashed the plane?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe pitched forward against the controls, sent the plane into a tailspin it couldn\u2019t recover from,\u201d he said, closing his eyes as if to ward off the memory. \u201cThere are so many potential outcomes. I can\u2019t keep up with them all. I had to retreat to somewhere where I could control more of the variables. The relief from the short-term chaos is wonderful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut every day is the same, isn\u2019t it? And you have so many of them,\u201d I said, my heart breaking just a little at the very idea. \u201cSo I guess when you seem disaffected and bored, you really are disaffected and bored. You\u2019ve been there, done that, and even when a few surprises come your way, they\u2019re spoiled for you. That\u2019s one of the saddest things I\u2019ve ever heard. And I was once the Dancing Hen at Clucky\u2019s Lucky Chicken Shack.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe light-fixture scenario was the first full-fledged vision I\u2019ve had in your presence, which was why I was so smug about it.\u201d He moved onto the bed and took my hand in his. \u201cWith you, I never know how things are going to turn out. You are a constantly shifting variable. It seems there are too many possibilities to see. In essence, you\u2019ve shorted out my gift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>The corner of his mouth lifted. \u201cDon\u2019t be. It\u2019s made the last two days rather frustrating but incredibly entertaining.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m happy to be of service.\u201d</p><p>He leaned in close to kiss my neck. I stayed perfectly still, battling my urge to respond as his lips trailed along my skin. \u201cGood night.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you really think I\u2019m going to be able to sleep now?\u201d I laughed as he settled in beside me, careful not to touch bare skin to the bedspread. \u201cI just found out that my road-trip buddy can see the future. It\u2019s a bit of an eye opener. I have a question or two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch as?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere do you come from? How did you become a vampire? How did you discover you could see \u2018glimpses\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s more than two questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHumor me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShall I start at the beginning?\u201d he asked. I nodded. \u201cI\u2019m from Derbyshire. My father was a baronet who took himself very seriously. I was the second son, the spare to the heir, as they say. Almost nothing was expected of me. My job was to remain respectable and wait in the wings in case some ridiculous riding accident claimed my brother, with whom I was not very close.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo joining the army was a rebellion against a lack of expectation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Father eventually got over the shock of any son of his engaging in manual labor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPause for the implied horrified gasp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously,\u201d he said, winking at me in a way that had my insides going all squishy. \u201cAfter Father got over the shock, he told anyone who would listen that it was only right that I fulfill my familial obligation to the crown. If the aristocracy didn\u2019t step forward to stamp out the upstart colonial agitators, who would?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate to be the one to point this out, but the upstart colonial agitators whipped your collective British ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you very much enjoy pointing that out,\u201d he muttered. \u201cAnyway, I was sent off with his blessing and with all the pomp and circumstance he considered appropriate. I was a happy soldier. I enjoyed following orders. As the war lagged on, we heard rumors of battalions being picked off from the far reaches of the battlefields, of bodies disappearing from the aftermath while the surgeons searched for survivors. By the time Cornwallis finally grasped that he\u2019d lost, we\u2019d attracted avid vampire epicures, who enjoyed feeding on the wounded in the confusion of battle. When they realized that the war was winding down and their favorite cuisine was leaving the country, they snatched us from the camps in increasing numbers. Myself included.</p><p>\u201cI would spare you the details, but let\u2019s just say that my turning was bloody, horrific, the sort of story we tell spoiled, modern vampires who complain about their own rebirth. And I had trouble adjusting to my new life. After so many years of war, you would think that a few more lives wouldn\u2019t matter. But I found that I couldn\u2019t kill again, particularly when I could see the results of their deaths while I fed. Children left without parents. Wives left unprotected and broken. I had to train myself to feed sparingly, carefully. But my gift was very valuable in other ways. It helped me avoid detection by humans, to find the best prey. That became more challenging as the population and its mobility increased. Still, I was able to see more of the world, make a living at a trade, neither of which I had ever thought was possible. It\u2019s been a good life. Difficult sometimes, but a good life.\u201d He looked up at me with a crooked, sheepish grin. \u201cI haven\u2019t told anyone about myself in a long time. Vampires don\u2019t trust their history to humans, as a rule.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why tell me?\u201d I asked.</p> <p>\u201cBecause you shared so much of yourself with me. And because I\u2019m sorry that it seems to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy life story is not tragic-painful, it\u2019s tragic-embarrassing. There\u2019s a difference,\u201d I told him, much to his amusement. \u201cSometimes I worry that the reason so many bad things seem to happen around me is that I went against what my parents wanted, like some sort of King Lear\u2013style ungrateful-child karma. I mean, I would have been unhappy going to law school\u2014in some alternative reality where I could actually finish law school. But at least I wouldn\u2019t be so distant from my family. I mean, they\u2019re all huge pains in my ass. With the exception of my relationship with Jason, they dismiss everything I do as just another \u2018silly Miranda thing.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did your parents want for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything but this.\u201d I laughed, gesturing around the room. \u201cThey wanted me to marry Jason, stay in the Hollow where they could keep an eye on me. Have babies. Join the PTA.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what did you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything but that,\u201d I said, the words escaping my mouth before I could think too much about how quickly I\u2019d answered.</p><p>\u201cAnd who is this Jason person?\u201d</p><p>And I couldn\u2019t but be a little pleased with the hint of jealousy in his voice.</p><p>\u201cWay too long of a story to get into now,\u201d I said, yawning widely. \u201cBroken engagement. Big drama.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will tell me about it tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Tell me more about you,\u201d I murmured. He complied, and I drifted off to the sound of his voice, smooth and honeyed.</p><p>SLEEPING AT THE WHEEL TENDS TO MAKE YOUR PASSENGERS NERVOUS</p><p>7</p><p>I had sweet dreams of citrus scents and smooth, cool skin. I was rolling on soft white sheets while strong hands kneaded my back, slipping between my thighs to play my body like a violin. I was lost in the sensation of hands sliding over my skin as I floated on waves and waves of pleasure. Every cell of my body was poised for release. Just one more swish of his finger against my little bundle of nerves, and I would scream\u2014\u201cCollin!\u201d</p><p>My eyes snapped open, mid-orgasm, as I writhed on the bed. I breathed heavily through my nose, riding out the last flutters and twisting my fingers in the sheets. My skin was coated in a light sheen of sweat, the back of my neck drenched.</p><p>I sat up carefully. The room was empty when I woke, a chair wedged under the doorknob. I would think about how he had managed to get out of the room with a chair propped against the door at another time. My bag was packed and all of my belongings gathered on the desk. It was still dark out, but I was determined to get an early start this morning. I had just enough cash to budget for gas-station coffee and a doughnut, which wasn\u2019t exactly the breakfast of champions, but it would have to do.</p><p>On top of my suitcase was a little folded piece of paper.</p><p>Miranda,</p><p>Good morning. I tried to fuel up the car while you were asleep. I watched you driving and followed the procedures you use, with the exception of waving my middle finger at other drivers who follow too closely. Overall, I consider my first modern driving experience to be a success. Putting gas in the car was another story. Please tell Miss Scanlon that I\u2019ll pay for the repairs.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, no!\u201d I gasped, running to the motel window. The car was parked right outside our room, half in and half out of the parking space. It seemed that Collin didn\u2019t know how to open the hatch for the gas tank. So he\u2019d simply stuck his fingers into the groove and forced the door open with his vampire strength. Three finger-depth dents now marked the side panel, and the hatch door hung by the tiniest shred of a hinge.</p><p>I made a strange noise somewhere between a squawk and a sob. \u201cShiiiit!\u201d I shouted, clapping my hand over my mouth. A hysterical giggle burst up from my chest, bubbling up through my mouth. And suddenly, I just didn\u2019t care whether I woke up the rap-loving bachelors upstairs.</p><p>\u201cHe was trying to do something nice,\u201d I told myself, squinching my eyes shut and clenching my teeth. \u201cHe was trying to help. Don\u2019t freak out. It\u2019s not like a broken gas door is that much worse than the new hood ornaments.\u201d Groaning, I returned to reading the note.</p><p>Also, you will need to put gas in the car, as I\u2019d forgotten that I did not have a wallet when I arrived at the station.</p><p>I snorted. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>I will see you in Omaha tonight.</p><p>\u201cWell, that was a very pleasant note, completely lacking in biting sarcasm,\u201d I murmured. \u201cOh, wait, here we go.\u201d</p><p>P.S. If I thought you made interesting statements while awake, imagine my astonishment at your candor while you are asleep. I didn\u2019t know some of those acts were anatomically possible. I pledge to spend more time on the Internet, so I can catch up.</p><p>What did I say? What did I\u2014Oh, Lord, did I moan? I seemed to recall that there was a lot of moaning ... And giggling.</p><p>\u201cFuck a duck,\u201d I groaned.</p><p>I drove like a bat out of hell for most of the morning, keeping the speedometer in that \u201cten mile over the limit\u201d cushion that cops tended to overlook.</p><p>I found myself worrying about whether Collin was comfortable in his little cubby. It made me sad to think of him in his crisp suit, lying in a sort of coffin with his hands folded over his chest. Then again, as far as I knew, vampires slept in the fetal position, sucking their thumbs. Did the bumps of the road disturb him? Was he too hot, too cold? Did vampires feel these things in their \u201csleep\u201d? Did he have a pillow? Did vampires need pillows? Ultimately, I decided there wasn\u2019t much I could do, since opening the cubby to check on him would expose him to sunlight and kill him.</p><p>I used my time, navigating the rolling fields of Nebraska, to hash and rehash the events of the previous evening. What exactly was going on between Collin and me? Twenty-four hours before, I\u2019d seriously considered lighting him on fire and blaming a faulty cigarette lighter. And somehow I thought it would be a good idea to roll around with him on a filthy motel carpet like a recently deflowered teenager on prom night?</p><p>I had a healthy sexual appetite, but nothing prepared me for the visceral responses that Collin drew from me. What did it say about me that I could get angry with Jason for telling Lisa that he loved her, but I could kiss Collin?</p><p>Collin was funny, without meaning to be. He was smart enough to be annoyed by my chaos and mess, but he also recognized that there was entertainment value in it. He listened to me, really listened, not just as a next step toward getting into my pants. He honestly wanted to understand what was going on in my head ... if only I understood what was going on in my head. He knew what it was like, coming from a family that didn\u2019t quite know what to do with you. And he made me laugh.</p><p>Last but not least, there was the fact that he was gorgeous in a tortured Byronic, Edward Rochester-meets-Lucius-Malfoy sort of way. He made me want to climb him like a proper British tree, for no other reason than that wrinkling his clothes would annoy him severely and, I hoped, provoke him into spanking me. He made me dizzy. He made my ears ring. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Wait, no. That was my phone.</p><p>Henry Rollins was singing, his ode to liars echoing in the cabin of the car. Jason was calling me again. It was time for me to talk to him. I hadn\u2019t spoken to him in almost a week. It wasn\u2019t mature or fair to shut him out like this. I hadn\u2019t asked for complete radio silence while I was on the road, just some space. I could spare a few minutes to let him know that I was safe.</p><p>And yes, maybe that was \u201cI committed frottage with a vampire\u201d guilt talking.</p> <p>I sighed and pressed the speakerphone function, remembering Collin\u2019s rule about talking on the phone while driving. But even as I reached for the phone, I found myself praying that it was just another ass-dial.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, you!\u201d Jason exclaimed, as if he were speaking to me from across a war zone and not the Heartland. \u201cOh, Miranda, honey, it\u2019s so good to hear your voice. I know you said you needed space, but not hearing from you has been driving me nuts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, Jason, really. I just need time to think.\u201d And you and your ass calling me a half-dozen times a day isn\u2019t helping my frame of mind, I added silently.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to give it to you, really. But it\u2019s hard. I miss you,\u201d he said. \u201cI miss talking to you every day. No one makes me laugh like you do. No one\u2019s made inappropriate jokes about professional baseball or network newscasters around me in weeks. I\u2019ve been bored out of my skull.\u201d</p> <p>This probably was the point when I was supposed to say I missed him, too. But I found that the sound of his voice just sucked all of the wind out of my sails. Why couldn\u2019t he listen to me when I said I needed space? Why couldn\u2019t he back off? What was with this constant calling? He didn\u2019t phone me this much when we were together.</p><p>Under normal circumstances, I would prattle through the day\u2019s events, ask him questions about wedding plans, try to trick him into revealing what he planned for our date that evening. But today I was just sitting there, waiting for him to tell me what he wanted so I could get off the phone. He was the one who wanted to talk to me so bad, so why couldn\u2019t he come up with conversation?</p><p>In Half-Moon Hollow, Jason cleared his throat. \u201cAre you having fun?\u201d</p><p>My lips quirked into a smile. I was, actually. Even with all of the disasters that befell us, I was having a pretty good time. But if I told Jason that, he would pout. I wasn\u2019t supposed to be having fun. I was supposed to be using this time for a sensible relationship inventory.</p><p>Also, the idea of his having to come up with a whole conversation on his own was sort of amusing, so I kept it short and sweet. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Awkward silence, empty enough to form its own black hole and swallow both of us. I wondered whether I could crinkle paper near the receiver and pretend I was driving through a tunnel ... in Nebraska. Did they have tunnels in Nebraska?</p> <p>\u201cI know you said you can\u2019t talk about your clients, but can you at least tell me if this vampire is being nice to you?\u201d he asked. \u201cDo I need to talk to this Iris Scanlon about putting my girl in a car with the cranky undead?\u201d</p><p>Something about the way he said \u201cmy girl\u201d made me all warm inside. He used to address his notes to me with \u201cTo my girl.\u201d Flowers, gifts, little tokens to show how much he cared, how often he thought of me. And I had loved knowing that I was his. It was the first time anyone had really claimed me. I mean, sure, my parents introduced me as their daughter, but they always did it with this note of apology in their voices. Jason had always introduced me with his hand on the small of my back, pushing me gently toward the other party, as if he couldn\u2019t wait for them to meet me.</p><p>\u201cHe is decidedly not nice,\u201d I said, smiling. \u201cWe\u2019re getting to the point where we can tolerate each other without death glares. That\u2019s about all I can say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if I need to fly up there and set him straight, you let me know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs much as I appreciate it, I don\u2019t think sending my ex in to beat him up makes me look very professional,\u201d I said. \u201cAlso, he\u2019s got all that vampire strength, so it probably wouldn\u2019t end well for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still your ex?\u201d he asked, a note of hurt in his voice.</p><p>\u201cAt this point, yes. I haven\u2019t made up my mind one way or the other, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said. \u201cI need more time. And for the record, I also don\u2019t think you could beat up a vampire.\u201d</p><p>I admit, I was just trying to distract him with that little challenge to his manliness.</p> <p>\u201cWell, how much do you think you\u2019re going to need?\u201d he asked, his tone growing testy.</p><p>Apparently, the attempted distraction was a failure.</p><p>\u201cHowever long it takes,\u201d I said. \u201cI hope to have an answer for you by the time I come back, but I\u2019m not making any promises.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just going leave me hanging until you decide whether you still want to be with me or not? That doesn\u2019t seem fair, Miranda.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I don\u2019t think the person who sent \u2018I heart you, PoohBear\u2019 texts to my maid of honor gets to make too many demands on me right now,\u201d I retorted.</p><p>\u201cOh, Miranda.\u201d He sighed and used that tone of voice that he only used when I was being stubborn or silly or both. \u201cDon\u2019t be that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat have you been doing while I\u2019ve been away?\u201d I asked, struggling to keep the petulant tone out of my voice.</p><p>\u201cOh, you know, staying busy with work,\u201d he said dismissively. \u201cEating dinner at my mom\u2019s, hanging out with Jake, that sort of thing.\u201d</p><p>The unspoken question hung between us over the phone line. Had he seen Lisa? Had he kept his promise to put a halt to their relationship while we were still trying to work out whatever it was that we had? I didn\u2019t know if I had the right to ask, given my circumstances, but he didn\u2019t know that.</p><p>He really didn\u2019t need to know that.</p><p>My inability and his unwillingness to discuss it irritated me for some reason, and I just wanted to get off the stupid phone and back to driving. \u201cI need to go. I\u2019m not supposed to take personal calls while driving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, all right, then. I just haven\u2019t been able to catch you over the last few days. I thought you\u2019d want to talk to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk to you soon, Jason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he said, sounding slightly wounded. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>I clicked the \u201cend\u201d button before I could respond.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t normal, I told myself. A simple conversation with a man I was supposed to love shouldn\u2019t make me that uncomfortable. I hadn\u2019t talked to Jason in days. I was supposed to be missing him, thinking about him. And talking to him had brought up all of these feelings of anger and disappointment. Was it the distance? Was his absence allowing me to feel the things I\u2019d suppressed because I didn\u2019t want to upset Jason, my mother, all of the people involved in the wedding?</p><p>The Miranda who had worked at Puckett and Puckett, putting up with her brother giving her noogies in the break room and her father checking her work for typos with a magnifying glass, never would have spoken to Jason in that flat, uninterested tone. She would have bubbled and placated until Jason got off the phone, assured him of her love. The girl who\u2019d hung up without saying \u201cI love you\u201d? That girl had run away to work on a yacht because college bored her to death. That girl had set a stage magician on fire. She\u2019d groped a vampire on a filthy motel floor.</p><p>Was I finding my way back to the girl I was? Was that a good thing or a bad thing? Sure, I\u2019d had more fun before I settled down with Jason, but was I a good person? I had way too much time on my hands to be asking myself these sorts of questions. This mental pathway promised madness.</p><p>I turned on the \u201cJason Called\u201d playlist, which included a crapload of Pink and Joan Jett. I hoped that Collin couldn\u2019t be roused out of his daytime sleep by aggressive femmes, because it was about to get loud.</p><p>I drove a little faster, skipping my lunch break. I drank too much cheap coffee. I got a lot of attention from truckers, thanks to my hood decorations. And I was very glad that the windows were so heavily tinted.</p><p>By the time the sun set, I\u2019d been driving for twelve hours straight, and I was exhausted. I\u2019d gone through the \u201cMom Called\u201d playlist, the \u201cI Haven\u2019t Seen a Starbucks in Three Hours\u201d playlist, and the \u201cMy Ass Is Numb\u201d playlist. I was planning to pull the car over at 6:04 as scheduled, but I heard the cubby door open with a squeak worthy of any Dracula movie.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I yelped, pulling to the side of the road quickly. \u201cI thought you didn\u2019t want the door open unless the car was stopped!\u201d</p><p>He climbed out of the cubby and into the passenger seat while I popped a packet of donor blood into the warmer. And somehow, despite recently sleeping and the fact that he\u2019d just done seat gymnastics, his clothes were less wrinkled than mine.</p><p>\u201cHello, Miranda,\u201d he purred, and the rumbling, rolling timber of his accent had me shivering. \u201cDid you sleep well last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know how I slept. You were watching,\u201d I muttered. \u201cAnd if you comment further, you will not get this nummy treat.\u201d I made a sarcastic wave toward the warmer.</p><p>\u201cI would hate to miss that. So where will our adventures lead us this evening?\u201d he asked, rubbing his hands together. \u201cPerhaps you can pick a fight with a motorcycle gang.\u201d</p><p>I gasped in mock incredulity. \u201cCollin, are you having fun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI simply enjoy trying to predict what you\u2019ll do next. Force of habit.\u201d</p><p>I assured Collin that I\u2019d eaten before he rose, so we should just keep driving. He drank his warmed blood on the road. I had no idea how I was going to handle the hotel issue. Collin would be furious when he realized that I\u2019d been lying to him. We would probably have to sleep in the car. And the farther I drove, the lamer the lie would seem.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d he asked for the fifth time that night. \u201cYou seem very tense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just want to make as much progress as we can tonight, so tomorrow night isn\u2019t such a haul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want to stop for a soda or a bathroom break?\u201d he said. \u201cYou haven\u2019t rested since I rose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I insisted.</p><p>But I wasn\u2019t fine. I was freaking exhausted. I blinked at the road, my eyelids and limbs heavy. I was so tired that holding my head up seemed to take a monumental effort. If I was alone, I would turn up the radio to obnoxious girl pop and sing along. I\u2019d open the windows and drink enough caffeine to fire up a legion of skater kids. I didn\u2019t think Collin would appreciate any of that, so I soldiered on.</p><p>I was quiet, mulling over the Jason issue and how I would approach him when I got back home. I dreaded seeing him. No matter what I said, I would be disappointing someone. If I ended it, Jason would be upset ... in theory. If I got back together with him, I would be disappointing Lisa. And if I didn\u2019t make a decision, I would be surprising no one. The odd thing was, I dreaded the prospect of dropping Collin off at Ophelia\u2019s and saying good-bye so much more than having \u201cthe talk\u201d with Jason.</p><p>The car was warm. The music was quiet and classical, heavy on lyrical piano. The pattern of yellow stripes marking the lanes created a mental rhythm, lulling me into a state of relaxation. My eyes grew heavy. I saw Collin in breeches and a waistcoat, shirt undone at the collar. He was standing in a field, emerald grass rolling like an ocean. The sun shone down on his skin, beautiful, ruddy, smooth skin glowing with health. He was walking toward me, his eyes twinkling with a special smile that meant that he was happy I\u2019d returned at last. His arms wrapped around me, pressing me so close that my nose nestled against the hollow of his throat. He smelled like rosewood and fresh-mown hay. His hands slipped up my arms, shaking my shoulders. He pulled away, staring down at me with alarm. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMiranda!\u201d he cried. \u201cWake up!\u201d</p><p>I gasped, bolting up in the seat. The car was veering right, my hands slack on the wheel.</p><p>\u201cMiranda!\u201d Collin yelled, shaking me awake.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m awake!\u201d I cried. \u201cI\u2019m awake! I\u2019m sorry!\u201d</p><p>The car was sliding off the shoulder into a rocky, unforgiving ditch. I yelped, jerking the wheel, praying that I wouldn\u2019t overcorrect and end up in the opposite lane or flip the freaking car. I sucked in a huge lungful of air, willing the oxygen to recirculate through my brain and wake me the hell up.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d he asked, brushing my hair away from my face.</p><p>I nodded, reaching into the cooler compartment to drag out a Coke and slug back most of it in one gulp. \u201cI\u2019m just a little tired.\u201d</p><p>And my nose was burning, because some of the Coke bubbles went the wrong way.</p> <p>\u201cTired, hell, Miranda. You\u2019re exhausted. I can feel it rolling off you in waves. You\u2019re making me sleepy, and it\u2019s practically mid-morning by my internal clock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine,\u201d I said, yawning widely. \u201cWe have a couple of hours to go yet before we reach our goal for the night. If we stop now, we won\u2019t be able to make the Hollow on time tomorrow night. We\u2019re too close, Collin. I can\u2019t hold us up just because I\u2019m a little sleepy.\u201d</p><p>Also, I didn\u2019t know how the hell we would pay for a hotel, I silently added, and sleeping at a truck stop didn\u2019t really appeal to me.</p><p>\u201cPull over,\u201d he said, opening his atlas and checking our route.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to drive.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have a license,\u201d I protested.</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t know how to drive. I just didn\u2019t want to be documented by the human government.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you afraid you would take a bad photo?\u201d I asked, yawning again.</p><p>\u201cImpossible. Look at my profile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd modest, too.\u201d I chuckled weakly. \u201cWell, I would be happy to let you drive, but I\u2019ve got enough to explain to Iris.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeaning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ripped off my gas-tank door!\u201d I exclaimed.</p><p>He huffed. \u201cI\u2019ve been secluded for decades. The last car I drove was wound by crank. There have been some changes in technology, but the principles are the same. Besides, the gas tank is nearly full. You have nothing to worry about.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI doubt that,\u201d I said. \u201cI appreciate it, Collin, really, but I can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can, and you will,\u201d he insisted. \u201cAnd imagine how much faster we will get to the Hollow tomorrow if we spend this evening driving instead of resting at a motel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo ... skip the motel and drive on through?\u201d I asked.</p><p>This was the perfect solution to my having to tell Collin about our money problem. And we\u2019d arrive in the Hollow early, which would impress Iris. If Collin didn\u2019t veer into oncoming traffic and kill us both, which would be a down side.</p><p>\u201cAnd if we arrive in town early and complete my business with Ophelia, perhaps we can spend some time together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re spending time together now,\u201d I reminded him, keeping my voice even, despite the excited fluttering in my belly.</p><p>\u201cYes, time restricted by deadlines, work policies, and your reluctance to get involved with a client. I would like to see if we enjoy each other\u2019s company without those constraints.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re worried that you only like me because you have a chauffeur fetish?\u201d I asked, tilting my head.</p><p>He frowned at me. \u201cMiranda.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the saucy little hats, isn\u2019t it? Everybody loves a saucy hat.\u201d</p><p>He pinched the bridge of his nose and sighed. \u201cI am reconsidering my previous statement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d I grumbled. \u201cYou don\u2019t see anything bad happening?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but that\u2019s no guarantee with you around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you have to stop for gas, wake me up,\u201d I told him sternly as I pulled the car onto the shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d he promised.</p><p>I slipped into the passenger seat as he jogged around the car to the driver\u2019s side. My photo journal was propped open in the console. Collin had shamelessly leafed through it again, despite my protests of privacy. I shoved it between the passenger seat and the console and told myself that it was rude to gripe about it when he\u2019d been so complimentary about my photos. While I\u2019d gassed up the car earlier in the evening, he\u2019d subtly worked in questions about when I would be returning to photography. I\u2019d told him I had no such plans and mentioned Jason\u2019s suggestion of taking Christmas photos at Sears for the diapered set. He was suitably horrified and dropped the subject.</p><p>\u201cThis is surprisingly comfortable,\u201d I told him, settling into the new front-seat perspective.</p><p>He clicked his seatbelt and slid his jacket over me. \u201cClose your eyes and get some rest.\u201d</p><p>I smiled, nuzzling my nose into the collar. \u201cTalk to me,\u201d I said. \u201cYour voice helps me fall asleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how to take that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a compliment,\u201d I assured him.</p><p>\u201cOK, have you ever wanted to be turned?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cI don\u2019t think so. I\u2019m pretty sure I would do more damage as an immortal. I\u2019m not afraid of dying ... I just want some dignity when it happens. But I think we both know it\u2019s probably going to involve a falling piano or an exotic tropical disease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think the world would be a lot less interesting without you in it,\u201d he said. \u201cI rather like having you around. Yes, it\u2019s frustrating. But it\u2019s also an incredible relief. The weight is off my shoulders. I don\u2019t feel responsible for the safety of the people around me ... except for you, of course. That\u2019s enough to keep me busy, but it\u2019s nice to have some focus.\u201d</p><p>I smirked as Collin started describing his childhood in England, his mother, his brother, in a rolling baritone that had my eyelids drooping. My head sank back against the seat. My sleep was deep and untroubled.</p><p>I was standing in the middle of a crowded, smoky concert venue, one of those run-down old taverns that try to draw in the younger crowds with watered-down beer and concentrated bad \u201980s rock. A mosh pit had formed around me like a sea storm of bodies, twitching and bashing against one another because the occupants were so bored with the band that being knocked unconscious seemed like a better entertainment alternative. I was battered by the waves of unwashed bodies, tempted to drop to my knees and crawl to the nearest fire exit. But that would mean touching the floor, and even in my dreams, I wasn\u2019t going to do that.</p><p>A squeal of guitar feedback caught my attention. Collin was standing onstage, the veins and tendons standing stark under his pale skin as he sang, \u201c \u2019Cause I\u2019m a LIAR!\u201d</p><p>The sight of straight-laced, polished Collin, shirtless and sweaty\u2014and with a pulse, if that angry red flush to his cheeks was any indication\u2014was enough of a shock that I froze. And I was whacked in the face with a flying combat boot for my troubles. Still, it didn\u2019t break the spell of Collin\u2019s stage presence, especially when he looked right at me, blue eyes blazing, and screamed, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m a LIAR!\u201d</p><p>Jerking awake, I sat up slowly, my mouth dry and my head fuzzy. A bit of drool had dried against my cheek, and I swiped at it vigorously. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d</p><p>My cell phone was blaring Jason\u2019s ringtone from the center console. Fumbling for it, I pressed my thumb to what I thought was the \u201cignore\u201d button. But my fingertip slid across the screen, and I hit \u201cspeakerphone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, shoot,\u201d I hissed, cursing my ineffectual thumbs.</p><p>There was a weird thumping noise on the other end of the line and the tumbling crash of furniture being knocked over. I huffed, rolling my eyes. Jason must have ass-dialed me again. I\u2019d almost hit \u201cend\u201d when I heard her.</p><p>\u201cJason!\u201d a high-pitched female voice squealed from the phone. \u201cNo tickles! You promised!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to get you,\u201d Jason sing-songed in the stupid voice he sometimes used as \u201cPlayful Sex Jason.\u201d</p><p>My jaw dropped as I stared at the phone in my hand, transfixed by the source of the obscene giggling.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d the woman squealed, clearly delighted with Playful Sex Jason. More delighted than I can remember being in months. \u201cNo, Jason, not the knees!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, the knees,\u201d Jason insisted, and I could hear sloppy kissing noises smacking through the receiver. There was a weird muffled thumping sound and more squeals. Jason groaned, and the girl sighed happily. There was another clear, hard thump. And another ... and another ... and another.</p><p>I guessed the \u201cemotional affair\u201d had taken a turn for the naked.</p><p>\u201cLisa!\u201d Jason moaned. \u201cOh, Lisa, baby, I love you so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I yelled at my phone. \u201cYou son of a bitch!\u201d</p><p>Collin snatched the device out of my hands and hit \u201cend,\u201d just as Lisa\u2019s rapturous moans hit a crescendo.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t need to hear more,\u201d he said quietly, keeping his eyes on the road.</p><p>Speechless, I stared at the phone as if I could reestablish the connection, reach through it, and throttle my former fianc\u00e9. Collin actually leaned away from me at the wheel as if he wanted to stay out of smacking range. I crossed my arms over my chest and seethed silently.</p><p>What in the actual fuck? How long had Jason been sleeping with Lisa? Had he been lying when he swore that he hadn\u2019t touched her while we were engaged? Had he waited until I was out of town to jump into bed with her? Did it really matter?</p><p>I thought about all of the times Jason had apologized for what happened with Lisa, all of the gifts and tearful talks. And I just couldn\u2019t wrap my head around why he bothered. What was his plan? To keep screwing Lisa until the wedding? For the rest of our lives? Why did he spend all that time asking me to come back to him if he loved his childhood friend? If he was in love with her, fine! Why not just take my breaking off the engagement as some sort of sign that they were supposed to be together? Was it that he couldn\u2019t bear being dumped by me? Did he want me back just so he could do the official dumping?</p><p>I rubbed my hands over my face, realizing that this was the question that had been eating at me, keeping me from committing to a life with or without Jason. If he loved someone else, why did he say he wanted me?</p><p>I\u2019d never trusted his sudden change of heart. I\u2019d been waiting for the other shoe to drop all this time, and it had kicked me in the face months ago. All this time, I knew deep down that as much as I wanted to, I\u2019d never be able to forgive him. Not really. I mean, I assigned him \u201cLiar\u201d as a ringtone. That should have been a whopping subconscious clue.</p><p>My heart had known for a while. It just took my brain a few months to catch up. And just when I was starting to feel a little bit better, I realized that we had a bigger problem looming ahead of us.</p><p>\u201cHey, Collin, where are we?\u201d</p><p>NOT OK, JOHN DENVER</p><p>8</p><p>We were supposed to be in Kansas City by now. Instead, we seemed to be stopped on the proverbial dark country road in the drizzling rain, in front of an ancient, rusting bridge. Well, half of an ancient, rusting bridge. The span that was supposed to project over the ravine seemed to have broken off and fallen in, leaving a precariously tilted bridge stump on our side of the crevasse.</p><p>\u201cCollin.\u201d I straightened in my seat. \u201cWhere the hell are we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t trust the GPS system on your phone,\u201d he said hesitantly. \u201cI believed I remembered a shortcut from my previous travels through the Heartland.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrevious travels through the Heartland? Decades ago? Before modern highway systems were built?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He pursed his lips. \u201cI may have gotten turned around in a few spots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long have I been asleep, Collin?\u201d</p><p>His lips pressed together, glowing white in the greenish light reflected by the dashboard. The clock read 3:20 A.M.</p><p>\u201cHow long?\u201d I demanded. \u201cHow long have you been lost?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAbout six hours,\u201d he admitted. \u201cYou were so tired, and I didn\u2019t want to wake you. You haven\u2019t slept properly since you left Half-Moon Hollow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix hours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiranda, I know you\u2019ve just received some upsetting ... news, but there\u2019s no reason to get overemotional.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOveremotional!\u201d I yelled, shoving the door open and stomping down the slight incline to the mouth of the bridge. Wind whipped my hair around my head in a crazed crown as the rain misted over my cheeks. The headlights were warm against my legs as I stood in front of the car, throwing my arms wide. \u201cOveremotional!\u201d</p><p>The sky was pitch black above our heads, the moon hazy and soft through the rainclouds. I gave the rocks at my feet a vicious kick, listening as they skittered over the edge and plummeted at least five stories to the shallow water below.</p> <p>\u201cYou get us lost, in the middle of God knows where, when we were only a few hours\u2019 drive from home, and you don\u2019t want me to get overemotional?\u201d I yelled as Collin climbed out of the car. I flew at him, slapping my hands against his chest. I shoved at him, forcing him off the crumbling asphalt shoulder into the grass. \u201cWe could be anywhere!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you getting so upset? It\u2019s my deadline, not yours. Look, I\u2019ll call Iris and Ophelia. I\u2019ll explain that it was my fault we got off track.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not even supposed to be driving the car, Collin!\u201d I exclaimed. \u201cIt\u2019s my responsibility to get us from point A to point B. If you tell Iris you got us lost because you were driving, I will be fired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiranda,\u201d he said, his voice hoarse as he wrapped his arms around me. I struggled against him, shoving my hands against his chest to break free. \u201cPlease, stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou suck,\u201d I hissed.</p><p>\u201cUnder normal circumstances, you wouldn\u2019t be so angry about this,\u201d he said. \u201cIf your idiot fianc\u00e9 had not just broadcast his sexual hijinks through your phone, you would probably think this was rather funny.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, you getting me fired from a job, after finally finding one that I enjoy, is not funny under any circumstances!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a little funny,\u201d he insisted against my forehead, with a level of mirth that was completely inappropriate given our current circumstances.</p><p>Before I could respond, I heard the crackle of gravel underneath the tires. The car was rolling forward! Collin hadn\u2019t set the parking brake, and the natural gravity of the slope was pulling it toward the ravine.</p><p>\u201cCollin!\u201d I shrieked.</p><p>He rounded the car, pulling the bumper and slowing the car\u2019s progress toward certain plunge-y demise. I leaned in through the open driver\u2019s-side window to grab for the emergency brake. Collin\u2019s strength slowed the car\u2019s movement, but it was still rolling. I yanked on the parking brake, only to have the lever snap loose and come off in my hand.</p><p>\u201cShit!\u201d</p><p>My feet slipped on the pavement, and I slid forward through the window, smacking my face against the upholstery of the driver\u2019s seat, just as the front tires rolled off the edge. I pushed back, hoping to balance on my arm, to find that my belt buckle was caught on the window track. I was stuck. I couldn\u2019t pull back from the car.</p><p>Great, now I was making progress toward certain plunge-y demise.</p> <p>Well, I always knew it was probably going to end like this. Though I did think that a falling piano was going to be involved somehow.</p><p>\u201cCollin!\u201d I screamed.</p><p>My legs dangled helplessly out the window, while I wriggled my hips to loosen the buckle. I felt a rush of air behind me. Cool hands jerked twice at my jeans, gripping at my waist. I spotted my photo journal, wedged between the passenger seat and the console, and yanked it free. Just as the car tipped forward, Collin pulled me through the window and set me on my feet. I watched helplessly as the brake lights disappeared over the edge of the bridge.</p><p>I stood, horrified and slack-jawed, as the cartoonish mushroom cloud marking the car\u2019s descent and destruction plumed up toward us. Any moment, I expected Wile E. Coyote to walk out with a little sign that read, \u201cUh-oh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe parking brake?\u201d I whimpered, holding the plastic lever up without looking away from the ravine. The photo journal hung loose from my other hand.</p><p>\u201cI may have gotten a bit bored while I was driving. And I\u2019m not used to modern automobiles. Everything\u2019s made of plastic now and, really, very flimsy. I may have been fiddling with the brake lever during the drive and ... bent it a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFiddling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was trying to help!\u201d he shouted back. \u201cI thought that if I could take a shortcut and get us home faster, it would help you impress your employer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you didn\u2019t see this happening?\u201d I yelled, gesturing wildly at the ravine.</p><p>\u201cI told you, my gift is hardly any use around you. All I saw was the possibility of us running off the road because you dropped one of those Slushee drinks in my lap, which I prevented by buying you a bottle of water. Who could possibly guess this would be an outcome?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, pardon me for being the jinxed albatross around your neck!\u201d I groused, slapping at his chest.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he repeated. \u201cPardon me for a minute.\u201d</p><p>I shrieked. I shouted nonsense curse words as Collin disappeared over the lip of the ravine. My heart plummeted into my belly, and I dropped to my knees, peering over the edge. I watched as he dropped gracefully to his feet, sticking the landing with some superhero crouch. The Batmobile was turned on its back like a fiery automotive turtle. The engine had burst into flames as the car rolled, engaging the gas line and creating a dangerous little blaze at the front of the car. Collin gingerly yanked the rear doors open, tossed the crumpled metal panels aside, and crawled inside.</p><p>\u201cCollin! What the hell are you doing?\u201d</p><p>He emerged quickly with his silver briefcase. He dropped it into the water, and I swore I could hear it steaming. I watched as he gripped the handle in his mouth and smoothly, rapidly ascended the rock face of the cliff.</p><p>\u201cAre you crazy? That car was on fire!\u201d I yelled as he climbed over the edge and deposited the case at my feet. \u201cThat\u2019s one thing on the short list of things that can kill you.\u201d</p><p>He held up his all-important case, looking rather proud of himself, which really, really annoyed me. \u201cThe case is fireproof. And waterproof ... and it can stand up to most explosives. It\u2019s made of the same material they use for the black boxes in planes. I\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t say the same for our suitcases and your purse, which seem to have tumbled directly into the flames.\u201d</p><p>Of course.</p><p>\u201cTh-the same material as black boxes?\u201d I spluttered. \u201cCollin, for once and for all, what the hell is in that case?\u201d</p><p>He opened his mouth, as if he was seriously considering telling me. But he clamped his lips shut and offered an apologetic smile. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you.\u201d</p><p>I threw back my head and growled in frustration. He still didn\u2019t trust me. Even after mechanical failures, partial nudity, and parking-lot rescues, he didn\u2019t trust me enough to tell me what I\u2019d been risking my neck to help him move cross-country.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d I told him, storming away from the ravine. \u201cI\u2019m out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiranda!\u201d he shouted, running after me. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs far away from you as possible!\u201d I yelled.</p><p>\u201cLook at it this way. You don\u2019t have to worry about telling Iris about the repairs.\u201d</p><p>I glared at him.</p><p>\u201cThe wound is too fresh to joke?\u201d he asked as I took a swing at him. He dodged out of the way, of course, and righted me when I nearly fell on my face. \u201cLook, we\u2019ll just find a motel, bunk down for the night, and call Iris in the morning to explain. I told you, I\u2019ll take responsibility for the car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem. We\u2019ll find a motel that accepts magic beans as payment!\u201d I whirled around on him. \u201cMaybe you can tell futures out in the parking lot to pay our way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d he asked, his brow furrowed.</p><p>Oh, right, Collin didn\u2019t know we were broke.</p><p>\u201cM-my purse,\u201d I spluttered. \u201cMy purse was in the car, remember? We don\u2019t have any cash, cards, nothing. You know, I thought maybe the worst you could do to me on this trip would be calling Iris and trying to get me fired, but clearly, I have underestimated you. I didn\u2019t realize you would stoop to vehicular homicide to screw with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiranda, that\u2019s not fair. I didn\u2019t do this to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but the aftereffects will still be the same,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cSlow down, woman. What could you possibly do? You don\u2019t have any cash. You don\u2019t have any identification. How far do you think you\u2019re going to get?\u201d</p><p>I turned on him, snaking my hand into my bra. Collin frowned, perplexed about why I was feeling myself up. \u201cHa!\u201d I exclaimed, pulling out a twenty-dollar bill I had tucked in the right cup. With the other hand, I presented my driver\u2019s license, which had been nestled under my left breast. \u201cAnd ha!\u201d</p><p>He stared at me. \u201cWhat\u2014what else do you have in there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. Well, not nothi\u2014never mind. I always carry my driver\u2019s license and extra cash in my bra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of situations like this!\u201d I yelled, throwing my arms wide. \u201cThese screwed-up worst-case scenarios that I seem to find myself in.\u201d I pushed past him. \u201cI\u2019m done, do you hear me, Collin? Done. I\u2019m done with you. I\u2019m done with your stupid case. I quit!\u201d</p><p>I turned on my heel and stomped off, the drizzling rain soaking through my clothes.</p><p>\u201cNot like you care,\u201d I grumbled petulantly. \u201cYou\u2019ve got your case, right? You\u2019re covered.\u201d</p><p>He caught up to me without really trying. \u201cDon\u2019t do that. I could have gone for the case, but I pulled you out of the car before it fell over the cliff. So don\u2019t pretend that I put this thing ahead of you.\u201d He grabbed my arm\u2014gently, I supposed, given his strength\u2014and made me stop. My momentum threw me off-balance into his side. \u201cAnd I do care about you. You force me to. Do you have any idea how uncomfortable it is to be induced to care about someone against your will?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you hit your head on your way down that ravine?\u201d I demanded.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re messy, and you\u2019re loud and chaotic. And you\u2019re kind. You have a profound sense of what\u2019s right. You made me laugh, really laugh, for the first time in decades. I like the way you look at the world, the way it comes through in your photos. I love that you are a constant surprise. I\u2019m two hundred sixty years old. Do you know how long it\u2019s been since I was surprised by anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you like me because I\u2019m chaos,\u201d I scoffed. \u201cI am a walking tornado of destruction. That\u2019s not exactly a profession of love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want one?\u201d he asked, grinning at me and leaning in as if to sweep his mouth over mine.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I reached up and popped him on the nose like a misbehaving dog. I put my finger in his face. \u201cSorry, that was probably an overreaction. I\u2019m just a little a wired. But really, do not even think about kissing me right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOw!\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cI guess you don\u2019t want one.\u201d</p><p>I turned and walked down the road with purpose. \u201cDidn\u2019t see that one coming, did you?\u201d I called over my shoulder. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He pinched his nose, testing it for broken cartilage. \u201cNo, I did not.\u201d</p><p>GIMME SHELTER</p><p>9</p> <p>The rain stopped, which was the only nice thing I could say about our long, silent walk to the nearest house. The road was broken and muddy, and the only thing that kept me from tripping or falling into ditches was Collin\u2019s keen eyesight. He tried to help me, catching my elbow when it looked as if I might topple over, but I jerked away from him. I didn\u2019t need his pity. I didn\u2019t need his help. I needed him to get a time machine, so we could start this whole trip over again.</p><p>We walked until my ankles ached, finally finding a cozy little farmhouse with a green roof and yellow shutters. It looked like something out of a Thomas Kinkade painting. The kitchen light was on, but the rest of the house was dark. In the distance, cows lowed, and chickens made little night noises. As we cautiously approached the front steps, I snagged a tomato from the garden and ate it like an apple.</p><p>\u201cOK, what\u2019s the plan?\u201d I asked as we closed in on the house. \u201cBecause a lot of scary movies and dirty jokes start out like this, and none of them bodes well for the lone female in this scenario.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does your intuition tell you about the owner?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one with the gift, not me!\u201d I whispered.</p> <p>\u201cYou have a gift, too.\u201d He put his hands on my shoulders and turned me toward the house. \u201cI feel one heartbeat in that house. But I don\u2019t know anything about the person inside. What do you see? What does the house tell you about this man?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged him off, stepping away as I scanned the house and the yard. \u201cThere\u2019s a truck in the driveway that\u2019s used regularly, lots of road dust, wear on the tires. But that pretty little champagne-colored sedan has been sitting in the carport for a while. See where the pine pollen and debris have formed a sort of chalk outline around the car? The wash line is worn, but it\u2019s sagging, as if no one has taken the time to wind it up tight for use in a while. The curtains in the kitchen window are in good condition but a couple of years out of date. And they\u2019re dirty. Someone who used to care about these things recently stopped caring. There\u2019s an empty case of beer by the garbage can, not to mention a bulk-size box of TV dinners. So I\u2019m thinking the good farmer\u2019s wife died a while ago, and he hasn\u2019t had the heart to sell her car or take down the curtains. The bad news is that because he\u2019s alone, if we move anything around, he\u2019s much more likely to notice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I could be wrong!\u201d I insisted as we rounded the house, searching the backyard. \u201cFor all we know, she\u2019s a lousy housekeeper on a visit to her sister\u2019s, and he\u2019s living it up, packing himself to the gills on beer and high-sodium TV dinners. Or he\u2019s killed her, and her preserved body is tucked away in a rocking chair in the root cellar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill, I think it was a very good guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t patronize me. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a good idea to show up at a stranger\u2019s doorstep with a vampire in tow. He could be a maniac. He could be an antivampire activist. For all we know, he\u2019s got silver stockpiled in there, and he\u2019s just waiting for an opportunity to try it out. After the night we\u2019ve had, I\u2019m not willing to take any chances.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWould it make you feel any better if I tried to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cScan the immediate future for my bloody, violent death via farm implement? Yes, it would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust don\u2019t touch anything, or make any decisions, or move,\u201d he said. He closed his eyes.</p><p>I pressed my lips together and crossed my arms. \u201cSo insulting.\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes as if concentrating, a line of frustration forming between his brows. After a few long, silent moments, he groaned. \u201cI can\u2019t tell!\u201d he hissed. \u201cI can\u2019t tell what the best course of action is. Damn you and your wily ways, woman!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, come on,\u201d I said, chuckling. \u201cI\u2019m not that unpredictable.\u201d</p><p>I sat on what looked like a wooden picnic table on the ground. It gave way beneath me, collapsing. I fell back, tumbling ass over teakettle down concrete stairs. I hit the earthen floor with a thud, whacking my head on a bag of feed corn.</p><p>\u201cOw,\u201d I muttered, wiggling my fingers and toes to make sure I hadn\u2019t done permanent damage.</p> <p>There was a blur of motion, and suddenly Collin\u2019s face was hovering over mine. \u201cAre you OK? Does anything hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pride,\u201d I groaned. \u201cAnd my ass.\u201d He helped me sit up. \u201cYou didn\u2019t see a hint of that? Nothing?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re trying not to laugh at me, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cI hate you,\u201d I moaned. \u201cI hate you so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t. You\u2019re just upset with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am, but I\u2019ll get over it,\u201d I grumbled, sitting up. \u201cEventually, I will understand you were trying to do something good. Your heart was in the right place, but your head was up your own ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a memorable and disturbing image.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d apparently fallen through the unlocked external doors of the farmer\u2019s root cellar. The farmer used this room as a storage space/storm shelter/winter pantry. Rows of carefully preserved green beans, peaches, and applesauce lined the shelves. I took a plastic gallon jug of distilled water and twisted it open, draining much of it in one long, blissful pull. My eyes landed on a first-aid kit and then the camping lamp hanging over our heads. Collin reached for it and tried to open the little glass cylinder.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t light it,\u201d I told him, flicking the little switch on top.</p><p>\u201cInteresting.\u201d He scanned the little windowless room, with its low ceiling and bare earthen walls. \u201cRather homey, isn\u2019t it? Clean, roomy, no instruments of death lying about. We can always just sleep here for the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it will be great, until the farmer decides he needs a jar of pickled beets tomorrow afternoon, opens the door, and then you\u2019re a little pile of dust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave a little faith.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally, Collin, why don\u2019t you just run ahead or something? You can cover the distance in a night, right? I\u2019ll be fine. I\u2019ll get home on my own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m a vampire, not a cheetah,\u201d he told me. \u201cI can\u2019t run that fast or far. And second, I\u2019m not leaving you behind. If I arrive without you, your employer will know we had trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think she\u2019ll notice when I show up without her car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take full responsibility for the car. She can\u2019t be angry with you over something a client did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour sudden bout of cockeyed optimism is annoying. Besides, say we survive the day undetected, then what?\u201d I asked. \u201cWe find a phone, call Iris, and beg her for bus fare?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll find a way,\u201d he assured me, lifting my face to meet his gaze. \u201cI promise you. We\u2019ll find a way to get home without getting you into trouble. Come on, woman! Where\u2019s the girl who showed up at my door three nights ago? The girl who called me a piece of work and reminded me I had no way of getting home except for her car? She would scoff at this little travel ... hiccup. Sleeping in a root cellar with a vampire. It\u2019s child\u2019s play. I would think it would appeal to your perverse sense of adventure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. I should make the best of\u2014hey! What do you mean, perverse?\u201d</p><p>Collin began rooting around for materials that we could fashion into a bed. I secured the door with an ax handle, then started searching through the pantry contents.</p><p>\u201cThis feels really wrong,\u201d I told him as he shaped a pile of empty feedsacks into a makeshift bed. \u201cAs if we\u2019re haunting this poor man\u2019s basement.\u201d</p><p>I cracked the wax seal of one of the jars and carefully picked out a few slices of fruit from the fragrant liquid with my fingers.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the name of not starving, I am appropriating this jar of spiced peaches. Consider it the sweet course after the tomato entr\u00e9e. My concerns about thievery decrease in proportion to my concerns about low blood sugar and dry heaves. Also, this stuff is fricking delicious.\u201d</p><p>He was watching me scooping the delicious, pulpy fruit from the jar and sucking the juice from my fingers. I cringed, knowing that this must be sending his OCD into overdrive.</p><p>\u201cSorry. I\u2019m being rude. What about your blood?\u201d I asked. \u201cIt went down with the ship, so to speak. Aren\u2019t you hungry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should be all right for a few more hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then we\u2019re going to have to find some willing donor?\u201d I asked. \u201cOr some synthetic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless you\u2019re offering.\u201d</p><p>Now, normally, I would consider it pretty damn rude to devour half a jar of spiced fruit in front of a starving man without offering him a meal. But I was still a little sore about the events of the evening. And I\u2019d never served as a vampire meal before. So I was going to have to sleep on it.</p><p>I stripped out of my wet jacket and did my best to comb through my damp hair with my fingers. I checked my watch. We had at least another hour before sunrise, but it was good that we were settling in for the night. Day. Whatever. When I looked up, Collin was stepping out of his pressed gray trousers.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I whisper-hissed, careful not to make too much noise and wake up our host upstairs. He folded the trousers carefully, the light of the camping lamp reflecting off his pale skin. His extremely pinchable butt was beautifully draped by black boxer briefs. I shielded my eyes with my hand, as if the sight were offensive.</p><p>\u201cI usually sleep naked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery time you get out of the cubby, you\u2019re wearing a suit. Nice try.\u201d</p><p>He smirked. \u201cIt was worth a shot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep the boxers on,\u201d I warned him. \u201cIf your next line is that you want to share body heat, I\u2019m not above smacking you while you sleep.\u201d Against the sliver of lamplight, I saw his lips quirk.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you have to choose tonight to develop a sense of humor?\u201d I grumbled as I lay down on the feedsack bed. It was surprisingly comfortable, a little like sleeping on a giant buckwheat pillow. Collin settled in beside me, on his side, smiling at me.</p><p>I turned away from him, content to let him stare at my back.</p><p>\u201cGood night, Miranda,\u201d he said, touching my shoulder gently.</p><p>\u201cGood night,\u201d I mumbled, snuggling deeper into the feedsack as he clicked the lamp switch.</p><p>In the dark, I listened to the house settling over us and finally processed the fact that I was utterly and completely fucked. My stomach felt as if it was turning inside out. I didn\u2019t love Jason anymore, but I was entitled to a few tears. I was humiliated and sick, thinking of all of the lies I\u2019d believed, all of the concessions I\u2019d made. I\u2019d let too much of myself go to please Jason. If anything, my time on the road had shown me how much more comfortable I was in my own skin when I was my unkempt, uncouth self.</p><p>I was confused, but it was the good kind of confused. Yes, I was a mess, out here on my own. But at least I was having fun\u2014or what passed for fun when I wasn\u2019t murdering innocent vehicles. I didn\u2019t want normal. I didn\u2019t want predictable. I didn\u2019t want the life Jason and I were going to build together. How stupid was it that I\u2019d made so much effort to create a life that I didn\u2019t want?</p><p>I was baffled by possibilities, the right and wrong of them. I was excited about the choices ahead of me. And it felt as if no matter what I did, it would be better than going back to Jason.</p><p>Still, listening to the mating call of the Not So Platonic Friends had singed my pride.</p><p>And I was going to be fired. Again. There was no way Iris would forgive this. Even if Collin had been driving, Iris couldn\u2019t keep someone on if she\u2019d lost an entire car on her first assignment. It set a bad precedent. But I liked the job. That was the bitch of it. I liked the challenge of getting from point A to point B. I liked the daily race to meet my mileage goal, even if I missed it. I liked being able to stop and take pictures of whatever caught my eye, just for the hell of it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019d finally found something I truly enjoyed, and I was going to be fired before I really got started. At least at the other jobs, I\u2019d had a few months before my spectacular failures.</p><p>Warm tears dripped down my cheeks. I held my breath, willing the oxygen to slip quietly in and out of my nose so Collin wouldn\u2019t hear me sniffle. As angry as I was, I knew that he couldn\u2019t grasp what he\u2019d done in the name of helping me. He was sincere in his apology, and he felt bad\u2014as much as he was capable of feeling guilty. I didn\u2019t want to make him feel worse.</p><p>I pressed my hands into my eyes, my shoulders shaking with the effort to stay quiet. Two cool hands slid around my wrists, pulling them away from my face. Collin wrapped his arm around me, pulling me to his chest. I pressed my face into the curve of his neck, feeling my tears form a seal between my skin and his. He rubbed his hands over my back, fingertips dancing along my spine as I cried it out. Soft shushing noises were the only sound in the dark little room.</p> <p>In the dark, I traced my fingers over the proud line of his nose, his eyelids, his cheekbones. He bent to kiss me, cool lips sliding against my warmth. He tasted clean, of mint and spice. I couldn\u2019t breathe, couldn\u2019t think. I was falling through the black space of the room, and Collin was the only thing holding me to reality.</p><p>This was a mistake, a huge mistake. I was using sex with someone else to get back at Jason or get over him or just get him out of my system. I doubted that Collin would mind being used. He might be fond of me in the moment, but I wasn\u2019t a blip on his screen. He would leave his indestructible silver case in the Hollow and go home\u2014most likely on a train\u2014and forget all about me. I would be left with nothing again.</p><p>But when he shifted my hips so that my thighs rested on either side of his, I just couldn\u2019t bring myself to care. He unbuttoned my shirt, pushing it back from my shoulders, and whispered kisses down the length of my collarbone. I rose to my knees, wrapping my arms around his neck as I ground down on the growing bulge in his lap.</p><p>He nibbled down to the swell of my breasts, tracing the top of each mound with his canines while I unbuttoned his shirt. He pushed me back on the improvised mattress and crouched over me, his eyes shining unnaturally even in the low light. The key hanging from his neck swayed against my chest with a solid plink. He seemed to be considering me, as if I was a particularly delectable dessert and he couldn\u2019t decide where to dive in first. He dragged his tongue along my bare ankle, up my shin to my kneecap. When he reached my Smurf panties, he pressed his open mouth to the damp cotton.</p><p>He moved up, taking one taut nipple into his mouth, smiling against my flesh. I tossed my head back, arching into him as I threaded my fingers through his hair. He settled between my thighs, dragging his lips across my throat, and his hand slipped under my waistband. He slid two fingers inside me, plunging in, twisting up to nudge at that mysterious, pleasurable spot.</p> <p>My Smurf panties joined the pile of clothes on the floor. I cried out and bucked my hips as he plunged again. His hips surged forward and spread my thighs farther apart. I wrapped my free leg over his hip as he entered me in one swift stroke. I yelped at the pleasant stretching sensation. The noise seemed to bounce off the rough wooden ceiling and echo throughout the house.</p><p>\u201cShh.\u201d He chuckled, pointing over our heads. I bit down on his shoulder, and he nuzzled his face against my neck.</p><p>Collin kissed me as he moved again, thrusting gently at first, then building, as I angled my hips in time with his. He tipped his forehead to mine and slid home again. I gasped. Lifting my ass off the bed, he drove into me. His fangs slid out as he threw his head back and moaned. My breasts bounced with every heave of his body over mine. His hand slipped over my collarbone, up my throat, and over my lips. I pulled his fingers into my mouth, sucking the tips as he moved in and out, up and down.</p><p>He pulled me up, into his lap, grinding our hips together as he guided me over him. He ran the tip of his nose down the length of my cheek, his lips skimming after. Light pressure pinched at my jawline, and fingers slipped around the nape of my neck, securing my head in place as he tilted it back. His tongue worked teasing little circles along my skin.</p><p>His lips closed over my jugular, and there was the barest hint of pressure ... and then ... bliss. He drew against the wound, the blood seeming to flow up directly from between my thighs, through my chest, and into his mouth.</p><p>I shuddered and stilled, unable to process all of the sensations needling at my brain. He rocked his hips, sending his rigid length against my warmth. My breath caught, and I snagged my fingers through his hair, pressing his face against my neck.</p> <p>Over his shoulder, I could see the faintest outline of light around the edges of the cellar door. Collin\u2019s movements were more languid, gentle, as the rhythm continued\u2014draw, rock, draw, rock\u2014until I was riding him slow and firm as he licked the twin puncture wounds at my throat. I felt the first flutters of orgasm and cried out with the force of it. Collin pulled me to him with bone-crushing force as he followed me, crashing back against the rough burlap bags.</p><p>Collin rearranged us carefully, settling me against his chest, kissed me one last time on the forehead, and promptly passed out.</p><p>PWNED IN THE PAWN SHOP</p><p>10</p><p>I woke up with a vampire snuggled around my waist.</p><p>That was a new entry in the \u201cBizarre Miranda Experiences\u201d annals.</p><p>I squinted up at the still-sealed cellar door and saw that the scant light around the edge had gone pink. The sun would be setting soon.</p><p>I scooted off the bed, no small feat with Collin\u2019s arms wrapped around my middle. It was a \u201ccoyote ugly\u201d situation, except that my partner was quite attractive but technically dead. After tugging and pulling for nearly ten minutes, I finally managed to pry myself loose and rolled off the feedsacks and onto my face. I slid into my creased, soiled jeans and shirt, wincing as I made my way up the cellar stairs.</p> <p>Clearly, the next time I had sex with a vampire, I was going to need to stretch first.</p><p>Outside, I heard a truck engine gunning. I removed the ax handle and lifted the cellar door just a fraction. Peeking out, I saw the farmer\u2019s truck ambling down the gravel driveway.</p><p>The neat little yard was bathed in dusky twilight. I eyed the little champagne-colored sedan enviously, but I knew that I wouldn\u2019t be able to take it. Particularly with those cheerful little garden gnomes glaring at me from the neglected flower beds. I was a lot of things, but I wasn\u2019t a thief. And even if I\u2019d only been guessing the night before, and the good farmer\u2019s wife had run off with the mailman, I wouldn\u2019t be able to stand the idea that I\u2019d taken a reminder from the man who owned this house.</p><p>In the picture I\u2019d formed in my head, they\u2019d been happy together. They\u2019d lived a long life filled with happy holidays, grandchildren, and long chatty breakfasts, and now the farmer was patiently biding his time until he could see her again.</p><p>When I got home, I\u2019d have to remove The Notebook from my Netflix queue. Clearly, the repeat viewings were messing with my head.</p><p>I looked back at Collin\u2019s sleeping form. I was cautiously optimistic about what had happened the night before. I enjoyed Collin. I enjoyed spending time with him. And he seemed amused, if not intrigued, by my ability to sow destruction wherever I went. Maybe he would be interested in pursuing some sort of relationship when this was all over. Was I in love with him? Not yet. But I wanted more than a \u201cfriends with benefits\u201d arrangement.</p><p>I wanted to know that if I came home at the end of a long day, I could call him and laugh with him over my latest misadventure. I wanted to tell someone how I really felt, not just the things my family and friends wanted to hear but my real fears and desires ... things I\u2019d already shared with him after knowing him for only three days.</p><p>For the first time in my life, I wanted someone I could really share my life with. I hadn\u2019t had that with Jason. I couldn\u2019t let him see what I was really like, the hair that took two hours to straighten, the clothes I\u2019d ruined with darkroom chemicals, the gecko tattoo that I\u2019d let my freshman roommate give me on a dare. But Collin would probably find those stories funny as hell.</p><p>I plucked at the chain around my neck and suddenly knew how we were going to get home.</p><p>After clicking on the camping lamp I searched the shelves for breakfast. As delicious as they were, I didn\u2019t think I could handle another jar of spiced peaches. I selected what looked like a jar of apple-pie filling and popped the top, carefully sliding the contents into my mouth. It was ambrosial, especially when paired with the lovely domestic distilled water. I ate half the jar while I tried to make out the rest of the dimly lit room. It seemed to be used strictly for feed storage and storm supplies. The only boxes I could make out stood in the corner. I took up the camping lamp and edged closer to them. In neat block print, the box was labeled, \u201cMAEVIS, CLOTHES, GOODWILL.\u201d</p><p>I glanced down at my wrinkled, stained clothes and wondered whether Maevis would begrudge me a fresh outfit. With my luck, stealing a dead woman\u2019s clothes would result in a hell of a haunting. But I balanced that against the thought of wearing these jeans another day and decided that I was willing to risk it. I opened the box to find an array of church dresses, housecoats, khaki pants, and mom jeans. There was a beautiful bottle-green double-knit suit in my size, but the idea of taking what was probably Maevis\u2019s best dress in her prime shamed me. I picked a more casual red-and-white check dress with a wide, pointed white collar. It was the sort of dress I could see Maevis wearing to a Sunday picnic. Unfortunately, I had to wear my boots with it, which ruined the effect.</p><p>I reached the bottom of the box and had to bite my lip to keep from laughing. The farmer was also donating some vacation clothes to Goodwill. I cast an evil glance my vampire\u2019s way. From the looks of them, they\u2019d fit Collin perfectly.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d I called from the farmer\u2019s front door. \u201cWe have to get moving before he comes back!\u201d</p><p>Collin\u2019s muffled voice came floating up from the cellar. \u201cI look ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI look like Lucille Ball\u2019s manly cousin,\u201d I yelled back. \u201cIt can\u2019t be that bad.\u201d</p><p>I opened up the little mailbox labeled \u201cMcGregor\u201d near the door. Despite the fact that it was the only cash I had on hand, I left my last remaining twenty-dollar bill inside, where Mr. McGregor was sure to find it. It eased my conscience a bit for helping ourselves to his food and clothes.</p><p>Collin emerged in an orange and blue Hawaiian shirt, his long swimmer\u2019s legs sticking out of blue plaid Bermuda shorts. I ruthlessly pinched my lips together to keep my braying laugh from escaping. He looked like a pale, pissed-off tourist. \u201cDo you have any idea what happened to my clothes while I was sleeping?\u201d</p><p>Currently, his pants were at the bottom of the burn barrel near the garage. And the scarecrow had received a brand-new hand-tailored shirt. \u201cI couldn\u2019t find them when I woke up,\u201d I said, my eyes as wide and innocent as a baby seal\u2019s. \u201cMaybe a barn cat took them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA barn cat?\u201d he repeated, raising his eyebrow. \u201cA barn cat that managed to get through the barred cellar door, take my clothes\u2014my clothes only, mind you\u2014and then escape unnoticed while we slept?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA very strong, very selective barn cat,\u201d I said, shrugging my shoulders. \u201cWe\u2019re just lucky I found these clothes in the Goodwill box.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmph.\u201d He sniffed. \u201cA vindictive little kitten who is still angry about an obliterated car, more like.\u201d</p><p>I grabbed his hand and led him down the gravel drive toward the highway. \u201cDon\u2019t be silly. What sort of kitten has a car?\u201d</p><p>The walk into town was long and arduous, but the sky was clear and the moon full. Collin told me stories about his marches with the king\u2019s army, trekking through what the British soldiers saw as the ends of the earth. We made good time, with Collin carrying me on his back for the last two miles. He was worried about me being too tired and insisted that it was payment for drinking my blood the night before without express permission. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t talked about the events of last night, by the way,\u201d he said, tickling my knees a bit while he adjusted my weight over his back.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m ready to,\u201d I admitted. \u201cI\u2019m not saying I regret it, because I absolutely don\u2019t. But I\u2019d like to wait until we\u2019ve finished this before we tackle something as heavy as the Talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do I get the feeling that, in your head, that\u2019s \u2018Talk\u2019 with a capital T?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re psychic,\u201d I said, grinning cheekily. \u201cAnd a discussion involving words like \u2018feelings\u2019 and \u2018commitment\u2019 deserves a capitalized title.\u201d He shuddered beneath my hands. \u201cI felt that.\u201d</p><p>We arrived on the outskirts of a town called Hader\u2019s Knob, which, it turned out, was in Missouri and only three hours away from the Hollow. We were fortunate to find just what I was looking for in the seedier part of said outskirts. In a town called Hader\u2019s Knob, there were bound to be seedy outskirts.</p><p>\u201cA pawn shop?\u201d Collin asked as I led him down Canal Street toward Golden Scales Pawn. \u201cBut we don\u2019t have anything to pawn.\u201d</p><p>I lifted my chain from around my neck, dangling my engagement ring for him to see.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he insisted. \u201cYou can\u2019t mean to sell your engagement ring.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d I asked. \u201cWe need bus fare. I am not going to marry Jason or anybody, really, unless my parents have arranged some sort of proxy marriage ... which I probably shouldn\u2019t mention around them, because it might give them ideas. Legally, Jason broke the engagement, so the ring is mine. Either way, it would hurt me a lot more to miss our deadline tonight than it will to sell this ring. So into the pawn shop I go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I told him as we neared the shop entrance. \u201cI\u2019d like to handle this on my own. It\u2019s a closure thing.\u201d</p><p>He smoothed my hair back from my face. \u201cIs this one of those mysteries I will never comprehend because I was born a lowly male?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou used the word \u2018lowly,\u2019 not me,\u201d I called over my shoulder as I pushed the door open.</p><p>Everything that seems sketchy about pawn shops from the outside is doubly true on the inside. You can almost feel the desperation and broken dreams dripping off the merchandise. I was glad that Collin was outside. Lord knows what he would have picked up, vision-wise. I wound my way to the counter through displays of used laptops, weird random \u201cart,\u201d and, most heartbreaking of all, a row of kids\u2019 bikes.</p> <p>A large bear of a man with a shiny bald head leaned against the counter, poring over a comic book. His tidy black polo had a shiny gold shop logo embroidered over a well-built chest. I didn\u2019t know whether I should be comforted or intimidated by his size, so I settled for clearing my throat politely. The man looked up from his Archie comic and smiled.</p><p>\u201cHow can I help you, hon?\u201d he asked kindly. His head shimmered in the greenish fluorescent lights. I wondered idly if he waxed it to achieve such a sheen. He gave me a small smile and pulled a soft maroon cloth out of his display case. I guessed he knew that I was going to pawn jewelry, since I didn\u2019t have anything else on me. I wasn\u2019t carrying so much as a purse.</p><p>I stayed frozen to my spot, unable to step forward somehow. I knew I couldn\u2019t keep the ring, didn\u2019t want to, really. But selling it seemed so final. It made me a little sad to think of Jason\u2019s family heirloom sitting in a pawn shop in the middle of nowhere. But I had to sell this stupid ring. I could not spend the rest of my life in a town called Hader\u2019s Knob.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t bite, I promise.\u201d</p><p>I fiddled with the chain around my neck. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ve never done this before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s OK, this time of night. We call it the \u2018Bad Decision\u2019 shift. Let me see what you\u2019ve got.\u201d</p><p>I pulled the chain over my head, because snapping one off your neck is not as easy as it looks in movies. And I handed it to the clerk.</p><p>\u201cAre you looking to sell or pawn?\u201d he asked, holding the ring up to the light.</p> <p>\u201cSell. I don\u2019t really want to see it again.\u201d</p><p>He frowned, taking out a jeweler\u2019s loupe. \u201cLet\u2019s take a closer look here.\u201d</p><p>I took the chain and stuck it into my dress pocket. Already, I felt a weight lifted from my shoulder. I wondered why I\u2019d held on to the ring for so long, why I\u2019d agreed to take it back in the first place. Maybe I should send Jason the remaining balance after we paid for the bus tickets, I thought. Surely we would have some cash left.</p><p>With his jeweler\u2019s loupe still in place, the clerk looked up at me and grimaced. \u201cHon, I\u2019ve got some bad news for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I damage the setting?\u201d I asked. \u201cI haven\u2019t exactly been vigilant about getting it cleaned or inspected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince you broke off your engagement?\u201d he asked. I nodded. \u201cAnd your fianc\u00e9 told you this was a diamond?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. Wait, did he say \u201ctold you\u201d?</p><p>I closed my eyes and waited for the verbal blow. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>He grimaced, placing the ring in my hand. \u201cWhat you have here is a high-quality cubic zirconia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you excuse me for a minute?\u201d I asked through a tight smile. He nodded sympathetically.</p><p>I walked out the front door, to where Collin was waiting for me. He opened his mouth to ask a question, but I held up a finger. \u201cYou ASSHOLE!\u201d I yelled. \u201cDirty, rotten, low-down PRICK!\u201d</p><p>Collin\u2019s eyes widened to the size of saucers, and he rushed toward me, glaring over my shoulder as if the shop was harboring some sort of junk-selling deviant.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I promised him. \u201cJust give me a minute.\u201d</p><p>I walked back into the shop, my fingernails biting little half-moons into my palms. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m better now. Clearly, I was given some high-end Cracker Jack prize. So please explain to me how it didn\u2019t turn my finger green or fall apart in the last year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, well, the band is fourteen-karat gold,\u201d he assured me. \u201cSee this little mark on the inside of the band?\u201d He held it up so I could see the tiny \u201cJM\u201d stamped into the metal. \u201cThat means it came from Jewelry Mart. Your fianc\u00e9 probably bought a costume ring off of a home-shopping network and had the \u2018stone\u2019 reset in a respectable band.\u201d</p><p>The pawn clerk reached across the counter and patted my hand. \u201cIf it makes you feel any better, this happens here a couple of times a week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I opened my eyes, fighting off hot, angry tears. \u201cSadly, that does not make me feel better.\u201d</p><p>I walked out of the shop with two hundred dollars in my pocket. I was sure that the clerk overpaid me for the scrap gold of the setting, but he probably wanted to get me out of his shop as quickly as possible. Surely having a woman pitch the fit of a small emotionally disturbed child in front of the counter had to be bad for business.</p><p>Collin was hovering outside the shop door, his expression anxious. \u201cI take it you did not get the price you expected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could say that,\u201d I said, sitting heavily on the concrete curb, my skirt flapping up in my face.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right, Miranda?\u201d he said, crouching beside me in his silly plaid shorts as I tucked my skirt around my legs.</p><p>\u201cDamn it, just\u2014damn it!\u201d I exclaimed, springing to my feet. \u201cHis mother never liked me. She said I was too flighty and frivolous because I thought it might be fun to go camping on our honeymoon, instead of the traditional Cordner trip to Niagara Falls. Who wants to take the same honeymoon that their parents took? I mean, most people would recognize that\u2019s pretty damn creepy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiranda, please, calm down. Translate for me.\u201d</p><p>I thrust out the four fifties I\u2019d gotten from the pawn clerk for the gold setting. \u201cIt was a fake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour fianc\u00e9 gave you a fake engagement ring?\u201d he said, incredulous.</p><p>\u201cHigh-quality cubic zirconia, according to the clerk. I should have known. He went on and on about how he\u2019d found it at this great little jewelry store in Louisville the last time he was there. But he knew he was giving me a fake! His mother probably told him that I couldn\u2019t be trusted with the real thing. All that fussing, all that handing the ring back and forth, and it never really mattered, because it was a hunk of nothing!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, I was waiting for an opportunity to reach a whole new level of humiliation, so this is great,\u201d I griped, walking out of the parking lot. \u201cI don\u2019t get it, Collin.\u201d I stopped, whirling on him. Collin nimbly sidestepped me while I ranted. \u201cI am, by nature, a pretty cynical person. I wore silver jewelry around you for the first twenty-four hours, just in case you decided to get frisky. So how does someone go through life not trusting the people around her and still get screwed!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wore silver jewelry for the first day we were together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust some rings and a bracelet. Nothing personal. I just didn\u2019t know you,\u201d I said, swiping at my eyes before the tears could form embarrassing tracks on my cheeks. \u201cAnd you know what hurts? If he\u2019d just told me it was a fake, I wouldn\u2019t have cared. If he\u2019d said he was giving me a stand-in ring until he could afford more, or as a backup to my real engagement ring, I wouldn\u2019t have even blinked. Hell, I might have thanked him for not putting me in the position of destroying/losing/garbage-disposaling a priceless piece of jewelry. I\u2019m just\u2014\u201d</p><p>I sighed, wiping my cheeks again. \u201cI\u2019m tired of being the fool. So please, please, do me a favor, and if you\u2019re planning to trick me or lie to me or somehow make a giant ass of me in some fashion, just warn me ahead of time so I can prepare the appropriate face. I\u2019m getting tired of making this one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t lie to you,\u201d he assured me as we turned in the direction of Euclid Avenue, where the clerk had told me to look for the bus station. \u201cI\u2019m terrified of you, you crazed, hyperviolent hoyden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a feeling that when I look up \u2018hoyden\u2019 in the dictionary, I\u2019m going to be really pissed at you.\u201d</p><p>The Hader\u2019s Knob bus station was a short walk through a rough part of town. The houses were run-down and dark. The cars were rusted-out and seemed abandoned rather than parked. I dodged piles of broken beer bottles on the sidewalk. I wasn\u2019t worried about us being attacked, because, frankly, Collin could use a snack. He seemed uncomfortable with my silence, unsure whether I was plotting revenge against him in the name of the Batmobile or Jason\u2019s viciously executed testicular \u201cdownsizing.\u201d</p><p>He kept squeezing my elbow, as if he was trying to gauge my temper or prompt one of his visions. He even followed me into the bus station, staying close as I purchased two tickets to go as far as we could get\u2014Marion, Illinois. There was a bus leaving in the next twenty minutes, which gave me just enough time to take advantage of the bathroom and buy a suspicious-looking turkey sandwich from a vending machine.</p><p>\u201cAre we going to be OK?\u201d I asked, eyeing the bus meaningfully as we boarded. \u201cNo tire blow-outs or mechanical failures to worry about? No terrorist plots that will result in my being used as a human shield?\u201d</p><p>He stepped away from me and stared off into space. A frustrated look passed over his features, and he stepped even farther away.</p><p>\u201cWe should be fine. Probably ... Most likely ...\u201d But by the time we boarded, Collin was practically quaking. Even though I was standing right next to him, his proximity to this many people in such a small space had his gift on overload. He saw everything, every possibility, every choice and its consequences. The whirlwind of images must have been nauseating.</p><p>\u201cToo loud?\u201d I asked. He nodded, his eyes squinched tight. I slipped my hand into his and thought of all of the hijinks I could get up to on the bus, picking a fight with my fellow travelers, chewing gum while I was trying to fall asleep, having it stick in my hair or choking on it. My personal brand of chaos worked its magic, drowning out the weak, humdrum hijinks of the other passengers. Slowly but surely, the tension bled from Collin\u2019s face, and he was able to relax. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he said, pressing a kiss to my temple. \u201cPlease don\u2019t let go.\u201d</p><p>We held hands in the aisle, even if it meant struggling to maneuver around the people slinging bags into the overhead compartments. We settled into our seats, and Collin wedged his case against his legs. Shuddering at the crowd\u2019s potential fates, he leaned his forehead against my shoulder.</p><p>The little old lady sitting across the aisle from us glared at him, her dentures flashing. \u201cShe\u2019s allowed to walk on her own, sonny. You don\u2019t have to keep ahold of her.\u201d</p> <p>Collin\u2019s jaw dropped, and his hold on my hand tightened.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s his first time on the bus,\u201d I assured her. \u201cHe gets carsick. He\u2019s just a little nervous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever could stand a clingy fella.\u201d She sniffed. \u201cGrow a pair, sonny.\u201d</p><p>To keep from laughing, I bit my lip so hard that it bled. He leaned in and licked the wound closed for me. The bus started and rolled forward. We got comfortable in our worn leatherette seats. I rested my chin on his shoulder and whispered, \u201cYou know what I\u2019ve noticed? People don\u2019t like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very likable!\u201d he protested.</p> <p>I looked over to the old lady, who was shaking her head.</p><p>\u201cI like you,\u201d I assured him. \u201cI like you very much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s a comfort,\u201d he said, pouting slightly. I leaned forward and caught his lip between mine, biting down. He groaned, pushing me back slightly. I could hear the little old lady chuckling.</p><p>Just then, the headrest of the seat in front of me slammed back, whacking me in the temple. \u201cOof! Really?\u201d I griped. \u201cBefore the bus even pulls out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI paid for the seat, lady,\u201d groused the mountain of a man sitting in the seat in front of mine. \u201cDeal with it.\u201d</p><p>Collin\u2019s fangs snicked out, but I squeezed his hand and shook my head. He put the fangs away and settled for glowering at the back of the man\u2019s head.</p> <p>Unfortunately, the giant pile of misanthrope sitting in front of me didn\u2019t limit himself to rearranging my face with his headrest. For the next hour, the poor woman next to him had to hear his opinions on the health-care crisis, the economy, and \u201ckids today\u201d and how the current president was responsible for it all. And vampires. And any other minority you could think of. All in a loud foghorn voice that reminded me of my uncles after a few beers.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to kill him just to shut him up,\u201d Collin muttered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help you hide the body,\u201d I promised.</p><p>The braying political commentator finally quieted, and I saw his seatmate\u2019s shoulders relax. He stood to get something out of the overhead bin. As he moved, the zipper from his jacket whipped against my face. I winced, rubbing my hand over my cheek. Collin arched his eyebrow as my fingers snaked up. When the jerk sat back down, I had the contents of his wallet\u2014two twenties and a handful of ones\u2014crumpled into my palm.</p><p>Collin\u2019s mouth popped open. \u201cWhat are you\u2014\u201d</p><p>I shushed him gently, waiting for the woman in front of us to lean toward the window. When her head turned, I slipped my hand through the gap in the seats and dropped the cash into her breast pocket. I considered it hazard pay. The loud guy plopped back into his seat, none the wiser.</p><p>Collin whispered, \u201cMorlock the Magician?\u201d</p><p>I smirked. \u201cI was always good with sleight-of-hand. Birds, not so much.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m continually amazed by the skills you have picked up along your way. What will you take away from your time with me, I wonder?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA profound fear of ravines and root cellars,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>\u201cThe root cellar wasn\u2019t all bad,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cA commitment to carry an industrial-sized can of anti-automotive-boob touch-up paint in every car I drive?\u201d</p><p>He squeezed my hand. \u201cI would hope that wouldn\u2019t happen to any person more than once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA distrust of any man bearing jewelry, family heirloom or otherwise?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cI will remember you said that when we reach a gift-giving occasion.\u201d</p><p>I shot him an incredulous look. He expected us to reach a gift-giving occasion? He said \u201cwhen,\u201d not \u201cif.\u201d He planned to spend more time with me. I tamped down the excited butterflies swooping through my belly. I didn\u2019t know how to respond, what to say. So I just smiled and kept his hand clasped in mine. I kept him entertained with observations about our fellow passengers for the three-hour ride.</p><p>\u201cWhen we arrive in the Hollow, what are your plans?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I said. \u201cA lot depends on how Iris reacts to her car being vaporized.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you, I\u2019ll take responsibility for the car,\u201d he said. \u201cDo you think you would be interested\u2014\u201d</p><p>The driver\u2019s voice boomed over the PA. \u201cFolks, we are five minutes away from our stop in lovely downtown St. Louis. Please remember to stay seated until the bus comes to a complete stop. Standing to reach items in the overhead compartment can result in fallen luggage and cranky seatmates.\u201d</p><p>I smiled slightly. \u201cWould I be interested in what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDriving me back home?\u201d he asked sheepishly. \u201cI don\u2019t think I would trust anyone else with my safety.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s just sad.\u201d</p><p>FRIENDSHIPS SHOULDN\u2019T BE FORMED IN PARKING LOTS</p><p>11</p><p>Marion, Illinois, was home to one of the highest-security prisons in the country. The inmate Hall of Fame included Noriega, John Gotti, and, most chillingly, Pete Rose. Needless to say, I was a little bit nervous when the driver unceremoniously dropped us at a bus depot five miles from the prison. Knowing my luck, there would be a jailbreak, and I would end up cannon fodder in some sort of standoff. I stuck close to Collin\u2019s side as we exited the squat little concrete building marked \u201cDEP T.\u201d I think someone had stolen the O.</p><p>\u201cHow much time do we have?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cTwo hours until midnight,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was really hoping you had some ideas,\u201d I told him. \u201cI am fresh out.\u201d</p><p>The depot parking lot was dimly lit by badly maintained streetlamps, casting long shadows over the handful of cars parked there. In the far corner of the lot, a tall man with dirty-blond hair was leaning against the side of a dark blue El Camino, talking on his cell phone. On his bumper was a large blue and white sticker that read, \u201cHowl, Half-Moon Howlers, Howl!\u201d I edged a bit closer and saw that the bottom of his license plate read, \u201cMcClure County.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way.\u201d I laughed. \u201cHe\u2019s from Half-Moon Hollow!\u201d</p><p>Collin drew his brows up. \u201cYes, and you seem very excited about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could ask him for a ride,\u201d I said, pulling Collin behind a partition outside the station so we could watch the man discreetly.</p><p>\u201cAre you serious?\u201d he scoffed. \u201cYou\u2019re nervous driving past a prison, but you\u2019re willing to solicit a ride from a stranger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say \u2018solicit.\u2019 It makes it sound dirty. And something good has to happen tonight, right? What are the odds of someone from the Hollow parking right outside the bus depot when we happen to get off the bus? It\u2019s like a sign. And I don\u2019t even believe in signs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be serious!\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cWhat happened to being annoyed by cockeyed optimism?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is more like reckless desperation,\u201d I said. \u201cWe\u2019re out of options, unless you\u2019re open to the idea of grand theft auto. We\u2019ve come too far to give up now, Collin. If I backed away, could you get an idea of whether it would work out?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, and I made myself busy with the barely functioning soda machine near the door. When I came back, sipping a tepid Coke, Collin was frowning.</p><p>\u201cNot him,\u201d he insisted.</p><p>\u201cWhy not him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a vampire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo are you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m a trustworthy vampire. He\u2019s decidedly ... untrustworthy,\u201d he said, glaring in the direction of the El Camino. \u201cBack-alley deals and seedy connections.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut no violent tendencies or dead hookers in his trunk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he conceded. \u201cBut it\u2019s an El Camino. He doesn\u2019t have a trunk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine, I\u2019m sure. You\u2019ll be right there with me, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will, but not where he can see,\u201d Collin grumbled. \u201cIf you\u2019re alone, he\u2019ll be more likely to help you. I don\u2019t know if that makes me trust him more or less.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what are you going to do?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see,\u201d he said. \u201cJust play up your ability to find trouble in an empty room. It will remind him of someone and make him more sympathetic to your plight. I\u2019ll be right behind you. Signal me if you get the least bit uncomfortable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I said as he pecked me on the lips.</p><p>\u201cI think this is a terrible idea,\u201d he told me.</p><p>\u201cI appreciate your candor. Now, shut the hell up and get out of sight.\u201d</p><p>As I approached, the blond vampire shut his cell phone with a curse. I slumped my shoulders and did my best to look beaten and defeated. It wasn\u2019t difficult. I wrung my hands as I approached the car, letting my nervous energy carry me forward, and pitched my voice in a distressed octave.</p><p>\u201cHi. You wouldn\u2019t be from Half-Moon Hollow, would you?\u201d</p><p>The vampire\u2019s eyebrow arched. \u201cAre you Frankie\u2019s girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Should I be?\u201d</p><p>He huffed out a frustrated growl. \u201cLook, honey, I don\u2019t mean to be rude. But I\u2019m waiting for a guy. Probably would be better if you weren\u2019t here when he shows up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be difficult, since I don\u2019t have any way to go ... elsewhere. I\u2019m pretty much stuck here without a way home. I was hoping you might be heading back there tonight?\u201d</p><p>His mouth was pinched and annoyed, but the sea-water green eyes were soft and just a little concerned. Collin was right; this guy was a marshmallow inside. I launched into my diatribe, letting just a little bit of tear-stained hysteria creep into my voice. \u201cLook, I\u2019m from the Hollow, too. And I hate to ask this of you, but I need a ride home. I got stranded with this guy, and he\u2019s just\u2014gone. He disappeared. Now I\u2019m flat broke, and my car\u2019s in little bitty pieces at the bottom of a ravine, which is OK, because that means I don\u2019t have to explain the boobs on the hood. And there was a washed-out bridge and a scissor-happy hotel clerk and rednecks with silver chains. And I just really need someone to help me. Could you see it in your heart to help out a damsel in distress?\u201d</p><p>The green eyes widened, and there was just the hint of a smirk at the corners of his mouth. \u201cLook, sweetheart, about five years ago, I would have eaten you up, but I\u2019m happily married now. I don\u2019t bite and bang anymore\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no!\u201d I exclaimed, raising my hands. \u201cI really just need a ride.\u201d</p><p>He stared at me for a long while, considering. \u201cJust a ride,\u201d he repeated sternly. \u201cNo funny business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can search me for silver if you want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do that,\u201d he promised. Behind us, I heard the crackle of tires rolling over gravel. Another car was pulling into the parking lot. The vampire opened the door for me. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you get into the car and wait here? Stay down. If you hear anything, you need to get out and run.\u201d</p><p>I froze, and he nudged me none too gently toward the car. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a small matter of business I need to conduct,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd my contact was supposed to be here hours ago. Now that he\u2019s here, it could get ugly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, wait, what sort of business are you into?\u201d I demanded. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBeggars can\u2019t be choosers, sweetheart. Get in the car,\u201d he said, shoving me.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cDick Cheney,\u201d he said with a wink. \u201cPleased to meet you, Jinx.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat, like the vice president?\u201d I asked as Dick slammed the door behind me. I peered over my shoulder and saw him flank the approaching car.</p><p>In the shadows, by the soda machine, I could see Collin. His face was pinched and worried as he observed this new development. His eyes locked with mine, and he mouthed, \u201cStay down.\u201d</p><p>I slumped down in the seat at the sound of Dick\u2019s raised voice. He was cursing vehemently, and I heard something about \u201ccounterfeit Snuggies\u201d and \u201cconnections in South America.\u201d There were grunts and groans as blows were exchanged, and the car lurched forward when someone was thrown against the bumper. I shrieked and covered my head with my arms.</p><p>The door opened, and Dick tossed a heavy duffel bag into my lap. He started the engine and gunned it, smashing into the car parked behind us. I shrieked, clicking my seatbelt into place as Dick wheeled the car around and slung my weight against the door. I saw a flash of orange and blue in the side mirror just before Dick sped out of the parking lot. There was a light thump, and I saw Collin\u2019s hand waving at me in the mirror.</p><p>While Dick ranted into his cell phone at a guy named Ralphie, I kept my head down and my eye on the clock. Dick\u2019s Dukes of Hazzard\u2013style driving meant we were making pretty good time down the interstate toward the Hollow. But whoever Dick had argued with wasn\u2019t following us, so he slowed down outside the city limits. Dick hung up with a final, \u201cNo, it\u2019s coming out of your share!\u201d and shot an apologetic look my way.</p> <p>\u201cSorry, hon. Believe it or not, that turned out better than I expected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo your business ... does this happen a lot in your line of work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEver since my wife asked me to try to keep on the \u2018lighter\u2019 side of the line, yes,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one seems to take me seriously anymore. That deal back there? That was for counterfeit University of Kentucky\u2013themed Snuggies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see how that would make it hard to maintain street cred,\u201d I told him.</p><p>He frowned, reaching into a little warming compartment between the seats and taking out a Faux Type O. \u201cSo tell me more about the car with boobs that ended up in the ravine,\u201d he said. \u201cI like a good story.\u201d</p><p>I spilled my tale of woe. Dick found it highly amusing. Somewhere between my car getting ravined and my engagement ring\u2019s mystique getting debunked, Dick was laughing so hard that Faux Type O was coming out of his nose. The sight was downright disturbing.</p> <p>\u201cYou know, you remind me a little of my friend Jane,\u201d he said, wiping at his nose. \u201cShe\u2019s another vampire in the Hollow. She had to be turned into a vampire, because the local drunk thought she was a deer and shot her. It was either go undead or go into the white light.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, does Jane run a bookstore called Specialty Books?\u201d I asked, my voice cracking.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He chuckled. \u201cHow did you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI drove her to Nashville this week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, you\u2019re Miranda, aren\u2019t you?\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cYou\u2019re Iris Scanlon\u2019s new driver!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know Iris?\u201d I squeaked.</p><p>\u201cSure, she\u2019s a friend of my Andrea\u2019s. I work at the shop sometimes, too, but I was, er, out that night. Jane was telling me about you. Did you really drop that marble dragon\u2019s egg on her foot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no!\u201d I yelped, the blood draining from my face. He knew my boss, and I\u2019d just confessed to the full complement of my professional nitwittery. I clapped my hands over my mouth. \u201cI can\u2019t believe\u2014of all the vampires to run into\u2014damn it!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCalm down, Jinx, I\u2019m not going to call and tell on you. I figure you and Iris need to work this out on your own.\u201d</p><p>I breathed a sigh of relief. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m the one who arranged all of the upgrades on the transport vehicle. You think I want to tell her that her newest employee destroyed the car she\u2019s been drooling over for three months?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBesides, Jinx, what\u2019s said in the El Camino stays in the El Camino.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould we talk about why you\u2019re calling me Jinx?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI give people nicknames, it\u2019s sort of a thing. If it makes you feel better, my other friends are nicknamed Stretch, Jackass, and Spazzy McGee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, I think that does make me feel better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re hungry, there\u2019s Corn Nuts in the glove compartment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you have Corn Nuts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiving friends, one of whom eats as if carbs are about to be declared illegal,\u201d he said as I dug into the bag. \u201cSo are we going to talk about your friend who\u2019s hiding in the back of my car?\u201d</p><p>I cleared my throat. \u201cSorry about that. He was afraid you would feel threatened if there were two of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t he just run ahead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t want to leave me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I think that makes me like him a little bit. Would he be insulted if I asked him to move up front?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I thought about the car-in-the-ravine incident. \u201cNo, he\u2019s OK.\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t exactly relishing the idea of returning to my hometown. Nestled in a crook of the Kentucky-Ohio River border, Half-Moon Hollow is one of those stereotypical Southern towns where everybody knows each other. Of the ten thousand or so people who live in the town, my parents played bridge, golfed, or went to church with at least half. There was not a lot of room for someone like me, who kept the gossip mill running like a hamster wheel. I\u2019d left as soon as the ink was dry on my high-school diploma and had never intended to come back. And now I didn\u2019t think I would have a choice about leaving.</p><p>The drive back to the Hollow was a strange mix of highly entertaining conversation, courtesy of Dick, and that strange \u201ctime molasses\u201d feeling you get when you\u2019re facing trouble. Time alternately feels as if it\u2019s moving too fast and gives you far too many opportunities to think about the exact depth of your particular paddle-less creek.</p><p>How was I going to handle the Jason situation? Part of me really wanted to approach it with all of the class and dignity that he wouldn\u2019t expect from me, while the other wanted to Taser him in bad places until his neighbors called the cops.</p><p>And even if Dick kept his mouth shut and Collin took the blame for the car, how was Iris going to react to my arrival? Wearing mismatched picnic clothes while bearing a bedraggled, barely fed vampire client in my wake wasn\u2019t exactly the picture of professionalism. And I hadn\u2019t contacted my mother in more than twenty-four hours, which meant that there was every chance she had called Iris to demand to know where I was. Maybe if I just skipped town after Iris fired me, my mom would assume that I was a missing person.</p><p>I could live in Mexico for a while. My Spanish was passable, and I enjoyed a good tamale. I groaned. I would not hide from my problems, I told myself. I would face up to what happened, tell Iris everything, dump Jason like a sack of manure, and figure everything out from there.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, honey, we\u2019re only a few miles away,\u201d Dick assured me.</p><p>I glanced at the clock. We were running right on time.</p><p>The Mexico plan wasn\u2019t so bad, really.</p><p>Ophelia Lambert had creeped me the hell out the night I\u2019d had to submit to various screenings to clear me as a transport specialist. When Dick drove me to a little two-story ranch house on County Line Road, I was sure he\u2019d taken me to the wrong place. Martha Stewart could have lived in this house. There were flipping geraniums in the window boxes on the front porch.</p><p>Iris\u2019s bright yellow Beeline minivan was parked in the driveway. Of course, it only made sense that she would want to be present for the inaugural arrival of the Beeline transport service ... which meant that I had even less time in her employ.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure this is the place?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s her house, I promise,\u201d Dick told me. \u201cAnd don\u2019t worry about Iris. She might blow her stack at first, but she\u2019ll eventually see the humor in it. Tell your man in the back that the next time he rides in my vehicle, it should be in the cab.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d I said, smiling despite myself. \u201cThank you, Dick. Really, you\u2019re a lifesaver.\u201d</p><p>He winked, the little dimple in his cheek giving him an impish air. \u201cI\u2019ll see you around town, Jinx. One thing about our little circle of friends, we\u2019re impossible to escape.\u201d</p><p>As I got out of the car, Collin hopped out of the truck bed. He gave Dick a manly little nod and straightened his loud Hawaiian shirt. The case was still cradled carefully against his side. My hands shook as we approached the walk, and I thought I might get sick. Collin took my hand into his and kissed my forehead.</p><p>\u201cIt will be all right,\u201d he promised. Just as he was leaning in for a better kiss, the front door of the house swung open. Ophelia Lambert stepped out, her brown curls bouncing in a sleek, high ponytail. She was wearing a red pleated miniskirt and a tiny red cardigan.</p><p>Collin\u2019s hand slipped away from mine. He straightened, squared his shoulders, and looked every inch the dignified soldier. I, on the other hand, looked like a vagrant, given the expression on the vampires\u2019 faces.</p><p>\u201cMiss Puckett, aren\u2019t you the surprise?\u201d Ophelia said, her lips twitching in amusement. \u201cCollin, so good to see you. And right on time.\u201d</p><p>Despite his ridiculous outfit, Collin managed to look smooth and collected as he bent low over Ophelia\u2019s hand. \u201cI couldn\u2019t bear to keep you waiting for this, Ophelia.\u201d</p><p>She smirked at him. \u201cClever.\u201d</p><p>Iris emerged from the house, her wild dark hair tamed into a respectable French twist. My boss looked tidy and sweet in her blue pencil skirt and white eyelet blouse. While she initially offered me a wide smile, her expression deepened into a frown when she glanced at the driveway ... and my outfit.</p><p>Before she could say anything, a lithe, cool blond woman sashayed out of the house and launched herself at Collin. \u201cDarling!\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cHow wonderful to see you. It\u2019s been ages.\u201d</p><p>What. The. Hell?</p><p>The blonde in question, Sophie, was another senior member of the local Council. I\u2019d learned not to trust that sweet face and those pretty manners during her \u201cqualifying examinations\u201d for the Council. Sophie was a sort of walking lie detector. She could yank the truth from someone\u2019s subconscious if she was touching bare skin. I\u2019d spent several unpleasant hours in her company during the Council\u2019s screening process for humans who planned to work in vampire homes. The process was necessary to determine whether I had some sort of death wish or a secret desire to go on a staking rampage.</p><p>Collin gracefully pried his way out of Sophie\u2019s embrace, with a pained glance in my direction. \u201cSophie, it has been too long.\u201d</p><p>Sophie was not to be deterred, however, and she linked her arm through Collin\u2019s to lead him into the house. She chattered away about this mutual friend and that. She wanted to throw Collin a dinner party while he was in town and introduce him to her neighbors.</p><p>Collin didn\u2019t spare me another glance as the party gathered in Ophelia\u2019s formal dining room. And why would he, with beautiful, polished Sophie and her smooth, nearly pearlescent skin and tits that seemed to have a gravitational pull all their own? I looked down at my borrowed, wrinkled dress and felt a blush creep up my cheeks. I drifted toward Iris, hoping that I could explain about the car quietly, get fired, and then slink away before I had to watch Sophie and Collin set up a bloody dinner date.</p><p>I had almost opened my mouth to confess when I realized that I was finally going to see inside the mysterious silver case! My brain spun with thoughts of the treasure I would be viewing in just a few seconds. Was it jewels? Precious archeological artifacts? The frozen head of Walt Disney? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Iris eyed me warily as I stepped eagerly toward the table. Collin placed the case in front of Ophelia with a flourish. He took the key from its chain around his neck and popped the lock. He lifted the lid, but I couldn\u2019t see inside just yet.</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s beautiful.\u201d Ophelia sighed, reaching into the case and pulling out\u2014</p><p>\u201cA teddy bear?\u201d I exclaimed.</p> <p>It was a very nice bear, its short brown fur perfectly fluffed, with soft velvet pads on its paws. But still. \u201cI put myself through hell for a fucking teddy bear?\u201d I shouted.</p><p>\u201cNot just any teddy bear.\u201d Ophelia preened. \u201cAn original 1902 Meinhoff with intact joints and ear rivets. And this one is one-of-a-kind. You see, the eyes are two different colors. The manufacturer didn\u2019t make mistakes like this. It\u2019s practically an urban legend in the toy world. Collin spent years tracking it down for me. It\u2019s for Georgie\u2019s birthday. She\u2019s going to love it. Thank you, Collin, Miranda, for making this possible.\u201d</p><p>What the\u2014why\u2014who the hell was Georgie?</p><p>My brain seemed to shortcircuit as I stared down at the little bear. It glared balefully up at us through one brown marble eye and one blue. All this time I thought we were carrying cash or jewels or nuclear secrets, and I was delivering a child\u2019s toy.</p><p>Ophelia turned toward Iris and myself, handing us both envelopes. I glanced down at mine, which was filled with cash. Hundreds, lots of them.</p> <p>Iris patted my shoulder. \u201cOphelia insisted on paying you a separate cash bonus if you arrived on time.\u201d</p><p>I found that the money only seemed to make my anger grow, particularly with Sophie wriggling all over Collin like some vampire Playboy bunny. I was dismissed again. I was the help. The inadvertent other woman.</p><p>\u201cCollin,\u201d I said, clearing my throat. Collin couldn\u2019t hear me over Sophie\u2019s coos and giggles. I cleared my throat even louder. Nothing. Finally, I exclaimed, \u201cSophie, do you think you could stop rubbing your breasts against his arm for about five seconds so I can talk to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiranda, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Collin asked, his brow creased as he pried Sophie loose. She pouted a bit but kept her chest to herself. He pulled me aside, asking quietly, \u201cIs this about Sophie? You have nothing to worry about, she\u2019s just a friend. An old friend from a long time ago. We\u2019ve known each for years. Trust me.\u201d</p><p>Where had I heard that before?</p><p>Just a friend. Sure, Sophie was just a friend. And then, in a couple of days, I would be treated to exposure to Collin and Sophie\u2019s secret sex life via video chat or text message or some digital media I hadn\u2019t heard of yet. No. I wasn\u2019t doing this again. I would not be subjected to the silly nicknames and accidental boob grazes of \u201cplatonic friends.\u201d My next boyfriend was going to be a hermit.</p> <p>Wait, my current boyfriend was a hermit ... and I still had to compete with plastic, breathless Sophie.</p><p>Screw it.</p><p>I turned to Iris, who seemed to be caught in a permanent wince. \u201cYou know what? Iris, I really appreciate the fact that you hired me. And I know my employment is pretty much hanging by a thread. But at this point, I don\u2019t care if you fire me, I quit!\u201d I stalked toward the door, grumbling about vampires and their bullshit. I stopped, turning back to Iris and Ophelia. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to be rude. Ophelia, thank you for the bonus. And thank you for the opportunity, Iris. I really appreciate it. And considering what happened to your car, I won\u2019t blame you for suing me.\u201d</p><p>I stomped out the door and down the stairs toward the driveway. Sophie chuffed indignantly and called me too immature to work with the undead community. As the screen door slammed shut, I heard Iris ask, \u201cWhat about the car?\u201d</p><p>ON THE ROAD AGAIN</p><p>12</p><p>Dick was waiting for me at the end of Ophelia\u2019s driveway, leaning against the side of his car and giving me a sympathetic look.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know?\u201d I groaned. \u201cAre you psychic, too?\u201d</p> <p>Dick chuckled. \u201cNope. But I\u2019ve spent enough time around Ophelia to know how these situations are going to turn out. Can I give you a ride home?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, smiling gratefully as he opened the door. \u201cWould you mind if we made a quick stop first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you tell me what happened in there?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll think about it,\u201d I grumbled.</p><p>Dick didn\u2019t blame me for being pissed about the teddy bear, but he thought that selling counterfeit Snuggies out of his El Camino was a valid business model, so I\u2019m not sure that was support that I needed. He seemed to understand that I needed some cheering up, so he shared Jane\u2019s latest exploits, which included dropping a case of coffee beans on Andrea and wrenching her own front door off its hinges while she was arguing with Dick over stocking \u201cadult paranormal titles.\u201d I was going to have to spend more time with Jane. She may have been the only person on earth who could really understand me.</p><p>\u201cCan you keep the engine running?\u201d I asked as I unbuckled my seatbelt. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>Dick frowned, clearly thinking that this was my home. He was probably wondering why I was planning to leave so quickly. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd can I borrow your cell phone?\u201d</p><p>Even more confused, Dick nodded and handed me a late-model smartphone. I played with the features on the walk to the house, until I found the camera function. I pulled the pawn receipt from my pocket as I climbed the steps. I took a deep breath, centering myself before I knocked on the door and dealt with Jason. He answered the door, coiffed and pressed as always, but the confused look on his face was priceless.</p><p>He glanced over his shoulder nervously but put his best smile on as he exclaimed, \u201cHi, sweetheart, you\u2019re\u2014\u201d</p><p>I cranked my fist back like a piston and swung at his nose with all of my might, landing a blow that sent Jason tumbling back across the foyer floor. He yelped, landing with a thud, clutching at his spurting nostrils.</p><p>I smiled, acidic and sweet. \u201cEnjoy Lisa and her ticklish knees.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBat the hell, Miradah?\u201d he exclaimed, slurring his words through his recently rearranged nasal cavity. \u201cI tink you broke by dose!\u201d</p><p>I tossed my pawn receipt at him. \u201cLearn to use your screen lock, you spineless, manipulative mama\u2019s boy!\u201d</p><p>And while he was sprawled on the foyer floor, with blood dripping down his nose and my pawn ticket perfectly centered on his dark T-shirt, I whipped out Dick\u2019s cell phone and snapped several pictures. Because this was a moment I wanted to remember.</p><p>I scampered down the steps and slid into the passenger side. Dick stared at me, wide-eyed, but had a huge grin plastered on his handsome face. \u201cDid I just help you commit a felony?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, are there important distinctions between misdemeanor and felony assault?\u201d I asked, flexing my sore fingers as we sped away from the apartment complex.</p><p>\u201cIt seems like there should be,\u201d he mused as I forwarded the cell-phone pictures to my e-mail address.</p><p>\u201cProbably better that you don\u2019t know, then.\u201d</p><p>Dick was nice enough to drive me to my parents\u2019 house, after assuring him that I wouldn\u2019t be \u201cbitch-slapping\u201d anybody living there. Before I climbed out of the car, I promised that I would come by his place on Silver Ridge Road soon so I could spend some time with Andrea. Dick seemed very keen on persuading her to take a cross-country trip with me, as it could only end in what he called \u201cworld-class acts of destruction and stupidity.\u201d He seemed to consider me some sort of vampire extreme-tourism attraction.</p><p>The house was quiet as I slipped inside. My parents\u2019 part-time housekeeper, Faye, had left dinner warming in the oven, but I was too tired to consider eating. I flopped onto my bed and pressed my face into the freshly laundered quilt. My childhood bedroom was always ready for me. The furniture was always dusted. It hadn\u2019t changed since I was a senior in high school. The walls were the same shade of Violently Violet.</p><p>I needed to take a shower. But I couldn\u2019t seem to find the will to get up. I couldn\u2019t move. I was exhausted, physically, emotionally, financially. I rubbed my face into the quilt and sighed. All that trouble for a stupid toy.</p><p>What could I do next? What was the step down from vampire chauffeur? Werewolf walker? Pedicurist for Bigfoot? I would have to Google that in the morning, I told myself. For now, I needed to sleep on a bed that wouldn\u2019t collapse, get sprinkled in broken glass, or attract prickish vampires. I closed my eyes and let exhaustion drag me under.</p><p>Someone was touching my face. I was curled into the fetal position on my mattress, and cool fingers stroked down my forehead, along my brows. I leaned into them, mumbling, \u201cMorning, Collin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Collin?\u201d a warm feminine voice asked.</p><p>\u201cMom?\u201d I lifted my head from the bed and blinked up, my eyes gummy and tired. The scent of my mom\u2019s gardenia perfume washed over me in an oversweet, familiar cloud. I ignored the recoil Mom gave when she took in the smeared makeup and Medusa hair.</p><p>She chuckled fondly and kissed my forehead. \u201cDarlin\u2019, what in the world are you wearing?\u201d</p><p>My eyes adjusted to the dark room, and I could make out the glint of Mom\u2019s ash-blond bob tucked behind her ears. The streetlamp outside my window reflected off the raw silk of her favorite slate-blue suit. It was one of those classic suits, the kind a woman buys in her thirties and will only give up when it\u2019s ripped from her cold dead hands ... or she gains twenty pounds. My mother hadn\u2019t gained an ounce in thirty years. The suit would be perfectly crisp, even after a work day. And although I couldn\u2019t see it clearly, I knew that her face was carefully made up to look professional and mature, as always.</p><p>\u201cHi, baby,\u201d she said, stroking my cheek. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019re home, where you belong. I was so worried about you being out there alone with some vampire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t just some vampire, Mom,\u201d I groaned, rubbing my hand over my eyes. \u201cHe was a pretty nice guy.\u201d</p><p>She sniffed and folded a pair of my discarded socks while I switched on the bedside lamp. I had this strange feeling of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, as if Mom had come home from work to have one of our come-to-Jesus midnight chats about why I should focus on passing trigonometry instead of auditioning for the school play.</p><p>Again with the sniffing. \u201cWell, I\u2019m just glad you won\u2019t be doing that again.\u201d</p><p>I swung my feet to the ground, wincing as my stiff legs cramped in protest. I stripped out of my borrowed dress and slid into my bathrobe. Mom straightened the picture frame I\u2019d bumped on my way in the night before and realigned the participation certificate I\u2019d received from a middle-school soccer team.</p><p>\u201cMom, I never said I wouldn\u2019t be doing it again,\u201d I reminded her. Never mind the fact that I probably wouldn\u2019t be doing it again. I still hadn\u2019t said it. \u201cAnd you\u2019d be surprised how nice some of them can be, some of the time.\u201d</p><p>She patted my head. \u201cWell, it doesn\u2019t matter now. Have you talked to Jason since you got back into town?\u201d</p><p>I avoided direct eye contact. \u201cYou could say that.\u201d</p><p>Mom took my chin in her hands, then glanced down at my bruised knuckles. \u201cSo I take it the wedding is off, permanently?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I nodded. \u201cI know you\u2019re disappointed, but really, you should be used to it by now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t be that way, Miranda. I understand why you don\u2019t want to marry Jason, really, I do. It would be too difficult, knowing that he was in love with another woman. Don\u2019t get defensive with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d I sighed. \u201cI\u2019m not being fair to you. I owe it to you to tell you this without my usual sarcasm.\u201d I sat on the bed and looked her straight in the eye as I said, \u201cMom, I appreciate that you\u2019ve tried to help me find my way over the past year, but I\u2019m not going to work for you anymore.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I reached into my shoulder bag and pulled out a bank envelope. I pressed it into her hand. \u201cFive thousand dollars. With the interest, I still owe you eight. I\u2019ll have it soon.\u201d Mom spluttered that I didn\u2019t have to pay so much at one time and I should hold on to part of it to invest in my new \u201cdating wardrobe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiranda, I\u2019m glad you enjoyed this little road trip, but that\u2019s no reason to throw away the progress you\u2019ve made. This was supposed to be an opportunity for you to make up your mind about your relationship with Jason, not to find another field you won\u2019t succeed in.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHey, that\u2019s not fair! I did exactly what I set out to do. I got my client from point A to point B, without ... permanent damage. I\u2019m making a rather substantial payment on the loan. That is the very definition of not failing,\u201d I said. \u201cYou didn\u2019t even ask me how I did, you just assumed, and I think that\u2019s what hurts me the most.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney, you know I didn\u2019t mean it that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Mom, you did,\u201d I protested. \u201cAnd I honestly don\u2019t think you realize you\u2019re doing it. You put me in the role of the family screw-up, because that way we don\u2019t have to talk about Glenn\u2019s tendency to spend Saturday afternoons at the Booby Hatch. As long as I keep screwing up, nothing else about the family need be called into question. You can pretend we\u2019re all still kids and you\u2019re still in control. You can keep us from getting into too much trouble, from getting hurt. Well, that\u2019s just not the case anymore. I have a plan. I\u2019m making progress. And that does not include working with you and Daddy at the law firm. I\u2019m grateful for everything you\u2019ve done for me, I really am. We both know that me working with you is not a long-term solution. I\u2019m bored out of my skull. If I stay there, I\u2019m going to spend every minute either planning my escape or resenting the hell out of you.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to accept that I\u2019m going to make my own choices, even if they\u2019re not the choices you\u2019d make for me, even if they could get me into trouble. I\u2019ve got to figure these things out for myself. The last couple of days were really hard. Working with this vampire\u2014I messed up more times than I can count, but I didn\u2019t fail. You always said that success was a learned behavior. Well, I\u2019m learning, and I\u2019m not willing to give it up just yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI really like the transport job, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you liked the pastry shop, and the magic act, and the studio.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, when I was still in the honeymoon phase, and everything was new and shiny and exciting,\u201d I agreed. \u201cBut as soon as things got difficult ... or caught fire, I gave up and came home to plan my next adventure. But this time, even when things completely disintegrated and it seemed as if I\u2019d never get home, I was having the time of my life. I think I\u2019ve finally found the thing that I\u2019m good at, and it combines all of the things I learned while doing the things I wasn\u2019t so good at.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>I chuckled. \u201cIt turns out that to be a good vampire chauffeur, you need the skills of a failed photographer, an understudy yacht mechanic, a well-trained waitress, a taxi driver, and a magician\u2019s assistant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Miranda.\u201d She sighed, her lip trembling. \u201cI didn\u2019t ever want to make you feel that you\u2019ve failed. And I know I\u2019m hard on you sometimes. It\u2019s just, well, I could always count on you when you were younger; your antics used to keep everything so lively. I was always proud of Glenn, but you were the one who kept your daddy and me talking.\u201d</p> <p>I snorted. \u201cI\u2019ll bet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, when we were worrying about you, we hardly noticed that we worked too many hours and hadn\u2019t had any real time together since our honeymoon. And when you grew up and started all of these wild adventures, I suppose I grasped onto that as something we could fuss over together. And when we got you to come home, and you were working for us ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou worried about me full-time?\u201d I suggested dryly.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to make you feel like a failure. Really. I was just so used to keeping my eye on you that it became a habit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is extremely unhealthy, Mom. And close supervision doesn\u2019t mean I won\u2019t do anything stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m starting to see that, considering Glenn\u2019s Booby Hatch issue.\u201d She sniffed, swiping at her eyes. \u201cSo when do you go back to work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, but I may have just quit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s a first for you.\u201d</p> <p>I gnawed on my lips. \u201cI know. But I\u2019m going to keep at it. Even if I don\u2019t work for Iris again, I\u2019m going to stay in this field. I really like working with vampires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me what he was like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>She smirked, pushing my hair back from my face. \u201cThe man who has you standing still for more than five minutes altogether.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been asleep for the last sixteen hours, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be obtuse, sweetheart,\u201d she griped. \u201cYou have intentionally avoided talking about your client every time I\u2019ve asked about him. And I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s because of some silly confidentiality agreement you signed for Iris. Now, tell me about Mr. Sutherland.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was ... contrary. He wanted things done exactly his way, or he became all stern and cranky. He gave me sixteen pages of rules and requirements before we even left his driveway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you always do so well with rules and requirements.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI drove him nuts from the moment the engine started. But eventually, I think he liked it. And Lord, I liked doing it, just because it made him break out of his stuffy persona and smile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA good smile?\u201d Mom asked, teasing.</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>\u201cSo why are you here instead of out there with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2014I just\u2014it ...\u201d I sighed. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have worked out. Like you said, he wasn\u2019t my type.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a silly reason. Your type usually looks like some of the clients coming through our offices. In fact, some of your boyfriends have been clients at our offices.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasy,\u201d I told her in a warning tone. \u201cDon\u2019t backtrack on this touching moment.\u201d</p><p>She tilted her head, and once again, I was grateful that I\u2019d never been on the receiving end of Mom\u2019s questions on the witness stand. \u201cIf you saw him again, what would you do?\u201d</p><p>I grumbled into my pillow but eventually admitted, \u201cJump him.\u201d</p><p>Mom sighed, clapping a hand over her eyes. \u201cI wish you wouldn\u2019t share these things with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. That\u2019s part of the reason I do it.\u201d</p><p>I stayed up for most of the night, telling my mom about my adventures on the road with Collin. She couldn\u2019t believe what I\u2019d put up with, what I\u2019d put myself through, just to keep a job. But I think it served to convince her of how badly I wanted to avoid coming back to Jason. She agreed that Collin sounded like just the sort of frustrating, fascinating man I deserved, and she spent the rest of the night trying to persuade me to contact him before he left town.</p><p>After unburdening my soul, I slept for at least ten hours. I plugged my iPod into the alarm clock and put my \u201cSleepy/Spa\u201d playlist on repeat. I woke up with a slick of drool dried to my cheek and my hair in wild disarray. I stumbled out of my room, whacking my shoulder on the doorjamb on my way to the bathroom.</p><p>A full moon shone down on my parents\u2019 yard. I went into the bathroom and splashed some cool water on my face. I peeled my hair back from my face with a headband and stumbled down the stairs.</p><p>\u201cMom, can we arrange an intravenous coffee system?\u201d I mumbled, plodding down the steps.</p><p>I heard my mother\u2019s tinkling laughter from downstairs. I hadn\u2019t heard her laugh like that since Glenn\u2019s wedding. It took all I had not to turn on my heel and clomp right back up the stairs. I would not be caught in one of my mother\u2019s meetings, whether it was with members of the church bazaar committee or a potential date or employer for me. The last one resulted in our not speaking for days because I dumped a glass of iced tea over Leonard \u201cWandering Hands\u201d Burton\u2019s head.</p><p>\u201cMiranda, is that you?\u201d Mom called. \u201cWe have a guest, honey. Come on down.\u201d</p><p>I was wearing a sleeveless flannel nightgown my brother had given me last Christmas. It was lavender, with pink kittens on it. Circa 1989 LA Gear slouchy socks completed the look. \u201cUm, I\u2019m not exactly dressed for company right now, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I think this visitor will be happy to see you, no matter how you\u2019re dressed.\u201d</p><p>Was my mom being held hostage? Was that why she sounded so sunny\u2014and somewhat desperate? I grabbed a heavy walking stick from the umbrella stand and stuck my head into the parlor entryway.</p><p>\u201cCollin?\u201d</p><p>I dropped the walking stick with a clatter.</p><p>He was standing in my mother\u2019s parlor, impeccably dressed in a slate-blue pinstriped suit, leaning against the mantel as if he\u2019d been taking tea in the family parlor for decades. My mom was perched on the edge of her seat, entranced by the smooth vampire.</p><p>Collin smiled winsomely at me. \u201cMiranda.\u201d He eyed the stick on the floor and suppressed a grin. \u201cThank you for disarming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t made up my mind about that,\u201d I warned him.</p><p>\u201cOh, Miranda, hush. Don\u2019t be rude to the man when he dropped by to give you flowers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFlowers?\u201d I glanced down at the elaborate arrangement of cream roses, lush orange calla lilies, and hypericum berries all bound together with a crisp orange taffeta ribbon. He placed the bouquet in my hands, fingers brushing against mine as he gazed down at me. \u201cIt\u2019s a little unusual to tip your driver with flowers, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, my driver was rather unusual,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I brought you this.\u201d</p><p>He handed me my photo journal, which I\u2019d apparently left at Ophelia\u2019s when I huffed off. I grinned at him, opening the book. It seemed slightly heavier. New photos were taped onto pages toward the back. Pictures I recognized as shots I\u2019d taken on our trip. The abandoned drive-in with its crumbling screen in the middle of nowhere. Collin at the diner booth, his eyes closed as if he was praying for strength. The Batmobile\u2019s boobs. Me sleeping in the slanted bed at the Country Inn. My hair was tumbling around my face. My features were relaxed and untroubled. Despite the surroundings, I looked almost angelic.</p><p>\u201cI was not aware that you took this,\u201d I said, lifting my eyebrows and showing him the picture in question.</p><p>\u201cI may have played with your camera a little bit while you were sleeping,\u201d he admitted.</p><p>\u201cMy camera that was burning at the bottom of the ravine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI also may have taken the memory card out of your camera while you were sleeping, so I could find a way to make copies of your photos,\u201d he said, palming the memory card with a flourish, extending that hand to me, then snatching it away at the last minute. \u201cYou\u2019re not the only one who\u2019s good with sleight-of-hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for giving this back,\u201d I said, closing the book and clutching it to my chest. \u201cI would have been very upset if I\u2019d lost it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to make my own mark on it before I gave it back to you,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cSophie\u2019s just a friend?\u201d I said, eyeing him carefully. \u201cThere\u2019s no history there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no interest in Sophie,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s too predictable, too polished. I want a woman who picks fights in parking lots with unknown assailants and loves to eat questionable food from even more questionable establishments and makes beautiful pictures of ordinary things.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHmph,\u201d I grumbled.</p><p>\u201cAnd for the record, Ophelia\u2019s sister was turned when she was a child. Ophelia does everything she can to make life more interesting for Georgie, including collecting very rare, very expensive toys. That teddy bear we were transporting was worth more than five hundred thousand dollars at auction. It\u2019s one of a kind. And I only managed to track it down by threatening several of my sources with ...\u201d He spared my mother a glance. \u201cA very harsh scolding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA half-million-dollar teddy bear?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA very, very rare half-million-dollar teddy bear.\u201d</p><p>I scrubbed my hand over my face. \u201cI hate you guys. I really, really do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Miranda,\u201d Mom scolded.</p><p>\u201cI am sorry,\u201d he said. \u201cI never meant to make you feel foolish. And I know I have been churlish and arrogant and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPigheaded,\u201d I suggested.</p> <p>\u201cThat seems fair,\u201d he conceded as I stepped toward him.</p><p>\u201cDemanding,\u201d I added.</p><p>He slipped his hand through my hair, cradling my cheek against his palm. \u201cI\u2019ll accept that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDickish,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure that\u2019s a word,\u201d he protested.</p><p>\u201cWhich would be a problem if we were playing a board game, but since this is supposed to be an apology to me, I\u2019ll say whatever I want. Mmm-kay?\u201d</p> <p>His lips twitched, even with my mom\u2019s horrified gasp in the background. She never cared much for my way with words. \u201cI can\u2019t say I love you yet, but I know that I want enough time to figure it out. I\u2019ve been alone for so long. And I was unhappy, but I couldn\u2019t figure out why. I didn\u2019t know what I was missing. And then you came stumbling into my life and I saw that it was you. I can live without you, but I don\u2019t want to.\u201d I stood motionless, gaping at him. He grimaced. \u201cToo far?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cNo, that was just about perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do find myself curious\u2014have you finally broken ties with the \u2018butt-dialer\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Decidedly. What exactly are you asking from me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was thinking that after spending much more time together, we could determine whether you want to spend the rest of your life with me. Whether you feel the way I do. I think I could make you happy ... barring natural disasters, mechanical failure, inadvertent public nudity, and pestilence pouring forth from the sky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot funny, but I accept,\u201d I murmured against his lips as he moved in to kiss me. I could hear my mother sniffling in the background. She was clearly eating this up with a spoon, and who could blame her? This was every suave-ass Cary Grant moment ever filmed, wrapped up in a much hotter package.</p><p>\u201cIris doesn\u2019t accept your resignation, by the way,\u201d he told me. \u201cShe said that anyone who can deliver a client safely, on time, with all of the mishaps we suffered and the, er, difficult nature of said client, is definitely someone she wants on the payroll.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven with the damage to the car?\u201d</p> <p>He shrugged. \u201cShe said to think of it as a prototype. Clearly, a built-in GPS system is the first feature she will be ordering in the next model. She would like you to take a few days off to recover, then return to work on Friday, with a pay raise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA raise?\u201d Mom exclaimed.</p><p>\u201cOphelia found my description of our adventures to be highly entertaining. I think Iris is afraid that Ophelia will try to poach you to be her personal driver. Either way, Iris has another assignment for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m almost afraid to ask,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a bit closer to home this time, from the Hollow to New Orleans and back. Jane has a vampire author coming into the shop for a book signing, and she prefers to see a bit of the country when she travels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I can face another motel for a while,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cShe specifically mentioned the Peabody Hotel in Memphis. Luxurious accommodations and a minibar you can ransack to your heart\u2019s content.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMemphis?\u201d I squealed. \u201cI\u2019ve never taken pictures of Mud Island. Oh, I can get kicked out of Graceland!\u201d</p><p>Mom sighed. \u201cOh, Miranda, not again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat security guard had no sense of humor, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you wouldn\u2019t be alone,\u201d Collin said. \u201cI\u2019ve requested that you drive me back to Washington ... at some point ... which I haven\u2019t determined yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me guess.\u201d I snorted. \u201cReturn date wasn\u2019t mentioned in that sixteen-page contract rider.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I expected to return immediately. But I\u2019ve found that Half-Moon Hollow has certain ... attractions I did not anticipate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were the master of anticipation.\u201d</p><p>He slipped his arms around my waist. \u201cWell, some things are even better than anything my paltry gift could conjure up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are too much,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cAnd by the way, Iris has a new policy. All client-requirement riders are to be a maximum of three pages. Her exact words were, \u2018You will never have to put up with anything like that again.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill wonders never cease?\u201d I said, smirking at him. \u201cSo we have a few days before I have to report back to work. We can get into a lot of trouble in a few days. If only we had vampire-safe transportation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I just happen to have vampire-safe transportation available,\u201d he said, pulling the curtain aside to reveal a dark SUV.</p><p>\u201cHow did you rent a car without ID?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cDid you know that the Council can issue valid vampire identification without a waiting period? And negotiate money transfers with Swiss banks? And replace vampire-safe vehicles destroyed in the course of Council business?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did not know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd they managed to wrangle a replacement for the credit card that motel clerk cut up.\u201d</p><p>I asked, \u201cDo I want to know how they knew my account numbers?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Because the housekeeper had finished the laundry, my traveling clothes were already clean and neatly folded. I stuffed them into my battered bag and slipped into jeans and one of Collin\u2019s shirts. He would get it back ... eventually.</p><p>I tromped down the stairs and could hear Mom tittering about the romance of a spontaneous weekend trip and how she and Daddy used to do that all the time together. I\u2019m not sure which marriage she\u2019s remembering, but I certainly didn\u2019t recall Daddy whisking Mom anywhere that didn\u2019t involve a deposition.</p><p>Collin was shooting a pleading look at the stairs just as Mom said, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry Lyle wasn\u2019t home tonight to meet you. He\u2019d planned to be here, but he got held up at work, which is typical. But I suppose Miranda won\u2019t have to worry about that with you, will she? She mentioned that you work from home. How fortunate for her ...\u201d</p><p>Was I mistaken, or was my mother sort of flirting with my vampire almost-boyfriend?</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d I asked, snickering.</p><p>\u201cYes, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe careful, sweetheart. Do let Collin drive every once in a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, Mrs. Puckett, we tend to fare better when Miranda is driving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Mom lifted her brows. She rubbed her sternum, just over her heart. \u201cI think I just stopped worrying, just the tiniest bit. What a refreshing change of pace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s hallucinating,\u201d I told Collin. \u201cRun for it.\u201d</p><p>I trotted out to the rented SUV, which looked like the Batmobile\u2019s clone. I patted the boobless hood fondly. \u201cI dub thee the Batmobile Two. I would crack champagne over your grille, but I think we all know how that would turn out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA busted headlight?\u201d Collin guessed. I nodded. \u201cWell, she\u2019s been christened in spirit, if not in spirits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s the quality of humor I can anticipate on this trip, it\u2019s going to be a long drive,\u201d I told him, climbing into the driver\u2019s seat.</p><p>\u201cCan we discuss your damaged knuckles?\u201d he asked as I handed him the atlas. He bent his head over my hand to inspect the bruises. \u201cDoes this new injury have anything to do with your fianc\u00e9\u2019s poor taste in jewelry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s best to leave you wondering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would expect nothing less of my girl.\u201d</p><p>I chuckled. \u201cMemphis is only going to take a couple of hours. Did you want to swing around on our way back and visit somewhere else? I\u2019m thinking Branson. It\u2019s the Las Vegas of the Midwest.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cI was thinking something closer for our first stop. Someplace like your bedroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t had time to get an apartment. I was staying with my parents. I just woke up. Did you think I normally looked like that in the evening?\u201d</p><p>He ignored that verbal land mine and chirped, \u201cBranson it is, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was just a suggestion. We don\u2019t even have to go to Memphis if you don\u2019t want to. We can just drive until we find a nice little bed-and-breakfast ... or the closest available flat surface ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like that last option.\u201d</p><p>I angled my chin toward the atlas. \u201cSo which way do we go?\u201d</p><p>He tossed the map into the backseat, where it landed in a heap. He leaned over the console, catching my mouth in a hot, sweet kiss. \u201cYou decide.\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
