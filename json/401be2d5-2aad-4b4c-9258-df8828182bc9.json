Maybe it was a good thing to have the Commander out of the way, but his generals had hauled the remnants of his army into pre-planned hiding places before Thorne, in charge of the Allied Ascender Forces, had been able to run them to ground.</p><p>Chaos now ruled Second Earth.</p> <p>The fucking war was still game on.</p><p>At the very least, the current engagement required another eight squads of Militia Warriors. Thirty-two trained men. But what the situation really needed was another Warrior of the Blood who could handle up to eight pretty-boys at a time. Eight, while a squad of four Militia Warriors struggled to slay just one.</p><p>He extended his vampire vision and in the distance saw that Warrior Santiago battled \u2013 holy shit \u2013 thirteen death vamps, way beyond capacity even for a powerful What-Bee. Santiago fought with his back to the immense monolith of the Superstition Mountains, a Latin God in the moonlight, his sword moving like a silver streak of lightning.</p><p>Samuel whipped his warrior phone from the slim pocket of his leather fighting kilt and thumbed over the surface. He kept his sword at the ready and turned in a slow circle keeping his eye sharp for more trouble.</p><p>\u201cCentral Command, Jeannie here.</p><p>How can I help, Warrior Samuel?\u201d He served as back-up to Section Leader Nathaniel. He didn\u2019t like the job, but right now what anyone liked didn\u2019t matter.</p> <p>He explained the situation, that he needed another eight reserve squads called in and another Warrior of the Blood to the Superstitions on the double.</p><p>\u201cDone.\u201d He almost smiled as he thumbed his phone. The women at Central could handle anything. And no argument.</p><p>He took one last look at the field.</p><p>The Militia squads were holding their own so he knew where he needed to go.</p><p>One problem remained: if he didn\u2019t release his dark power on the battlefield right now, something he never did because of the unpredictable qualities of his power, how the hell was he supposed to support Santiago? In his current state, if even three death vamps turned on him, he\u2019d be dead.</p><p>Yet he\u2019d vowed never to allow that power to flow again, because the part he couldn\u2019t control forged random streams of killing energy, a terrible phenomenon that had happened a year ago, the day of his escape from a decade of captivity and torture. During his escape, launched by Warrior Duncan, Samuel\u2019s streaming power had taken several innocent lives.</p><p>That he\u2019d killed his captors hadn\u2019t troubled his conscience even a little, but he still saw the faces of those guiltless men who had died despite his most strenuous efforts to corral the power and stop the deadly streams. They lived in his mind\u2019s eye, hunched men, little better than slaves, who had cleaned his cell, bathed him while he was strung up in those heinous ropes, and who had fed him. More than once, one of those slaves had offered him a vein, which he\u2019d taken greedily, as blood-starved as he\u2019d been.</p><p>Their deaths lived like a terrible fire in his soul and for that reason alone he held back.</p> <p>He flexed his sword in his hand, his gaze fixed on Santiago. The warrior\u2019s situation hadn\u2019t improved and back-up still hadn\u2019t arrived.</p><p>Slowly he started to cross the desert in his direction. With thirteen pretty-boys still harassing him, and not one having yet fallen, it would only be a matter of time.</p><p>Shit, a single misstep on the What-Bee\u2019s part, and he\u2019d be dead.</p><p>Samuel needed to release his dark power, but if he did, would Santiago get caught in one of those terrible, uncontrollable energy streams?</p><p>He heard Santiago give a shout, calling for back-up.</p><p>Samuel couldn\u2019t remember the last time a Warrior of the Blood had called for back-up.</p><p>If he didn\u2019t do this, if he didn\u2019t at least try, a Warrior of the Blood would die tonight and it would be on his head for eternity.</p><p>He\u2019d just run out of choices.</p><p>Settling into himself as much as he could, he reached deep into his soul, the place where he\u2019d found all that power, that had helped him escape a decade of torture.</p><p>With his chin low to his chest, and his gaze fixed on Santiago, he allowed the power to take him over, to rise in a dark, possessive tide, up and up, building an excess of strength into every limb until his quads twitched, his biceps flexed, and his molars ground against each other.</p><p>The darkness moved straight up, invading his body, searing his muscles, power that didn\u2019t belong in this ascended world, not on Second Earth at least. No, this had always felt like something greater, like a Third Earth manifestation.</p><p>And with the power, a smoky mist rose from his body, a dark thin cloud that swirled around him.</p><p>More power followed and the bloodied sword in his right hand no longer felt heavy from tedious hours of battling, but became light as a feather.</p><p>He held his position, however, waiting to see if the deadly streams of energy flowed from him. If they made even the smallest appearance, he\u2019d fold himself to the middle of the desert in order to keep from killing his brothers-in-arms.</p><p>But he felt nothing as he had the night of his escape, when rage had flooded his heart and mind and delivered up this power for the first time.</p><p>In fact, he felt in control of what now possessed him and when Santiago shouted again, Samuel made his decision.</p><p>The time had come.</p><p>He folded three feet behind the arc of the black-winged bastards that kept Santiago pressed against the mountain wall.</p><p>\u201cHey, assholes,\u201d he called out.</p><p>Two of the pretty-boys turned around, a big mistake for one of them.</p><p>Santiago, who had battled at Warrior of the Blood level for most of his life, took advantage of Samuel\u2019s move and drove his sword straight through the death vampire\u2019s kidneys, sending his shriek into the air and his body lurching forward into cactus and dirt. Without missing a beat, Santiago returned to battling the rest of them, his sword once more moving in swift slices.</p><p>The second death vamp offered Samuel a slow smile and in any other situation, he\u2019d have reason to fear the significantly more powerful death vampire. A big motherfucker, this one definitely carried more muscle mass, though he matched Samuel\u2019s six-five height.</p><p>But Samuel knew his strength, so he smiled in return, which gave the bastard a moment\u2019s pause before he engaged.</p><p>Samuel\u2019s sword met steel, the strike sending a heavy vibration up his right arm.</p><p>He countered, and smiled as the pretty- boy took a step back. The death vampire was incredibly beautiful with long dark hair, a porcelain complexion, and an aligning of features that eventually made him and all his murdering kind look alike.</p><p>Purpose?</p><p>Enthrallment, of course.</p><p>Bastards.</p><p>The death vampire finally lost all his good-humor and came back enraged that he\u2019d lost his easy victory. He even whistled for back-up.</p><p>Samuel\u2019s turn to smile. \u201cCan\u2019t do this alone?</p><p>Bring it, pretty-boy.\u201d The nickname sent color at last into the death vamp\u2019s oh-so-lovely complexion as well as a series of reckless moves.</p><p>A few seconds later, as Samuel continued to match his slices and thrusts, one of his fellow vamps joined him.</p><p>Samuel kept summoning the dark power and his muscles filled with all that incredible strength. He gave it free rein because these bastards needed to die.</p><p>Death vampires drank the innocent to death in order to get at the euphoric nature of dying blood.</p><p>He folded, spun, and caught one of the death vamps straight across the hamstrings so that the pretty-boy dropped to his knees.</p><p>Just as the other turned to engage, Samuel folded again, but instead of landing on earth, he materialized in the air above his enemy, something rare in his world. He brought his dagger from his weapons harness into his left hand and as he came down on the vamp, drew the sharp blade in a clean cut across his throat.</p><p>Samuel folded once more, spinning mid-dematerialization then reappearing behind two death vamps still battling Santiago. The rest of the action became a blur of cutting tendons, running slices through wing-locks, and of course taking off the oh-so-beautiful heads of his enemy.</p><p>He breathed hard when the last headless corpse leaked blood over the dirt. He stood with arms wide, sword up, still on alert as his gaze searched for the enemy high in the air and into every crevice of the monolith.</p><p>\u201cSamuel? Is that you, hermano?\u201d He heard his name and spun in Santiago\u2019s direction. A metallic smell coated the dusty desert air.</p><p>The famous warrior looked at ease, wiping his blade down with a cloth he\u2019d folded into his hand. His sword had a ruby set in the center of the cross-guard.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Samuel spit. He\u2019d meant to get the hell out of there before Santiago took stock of him, but the battle had kicked his fighting rage into high gear and all he could think about was being ready for the next round.</p><p>Santiago drew his thin warrior phone into his hand and called for clean-up.</p><p>When he ended the call, he said, \u201cClose your eyes.\u201d Samuel dropped his lids and a flash told him that Jeannie had orchestrated a full scale removal of disconnected debris including corpses, body parts, and blood.</p><p>The process took only a couple of seconds, so yes, Central had power. He popped his eyes open and here was one miracle of their world, that they now had technology to leave a pristine desert behind after a battle.</p><p>\u201cWhen were you going to show Luken this power of yours? Or Jean- Pierre? Right now I\u2019m not sure which brother will be more angry with you.\u201d Santiago still had a Spanish accent, even after several centuries, something that tended to stick for all ascenders, depending on place of birth. Santiago was from Mortal Earth Spain a few hundred years ago. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNever.\u201d Samuel\u2019s voice sounded rougher than usual. His power had that effect.</p><p>He turned, ready to fold someplace else, away from the battle site in order to resume his natural state, but back-up had finally arrived.</p><p>Luken, the leader of the Warriors of the Blood, stood beside Jean-Pierre and both men glared at him.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not doing this,\u201d Samuel said, meeting Luken\u2019s gaze dead on. \u201cYou can\u2019t have this ability for your Warrior of the Blood shit.\u201d Samuel had been a Militia Warrior, a Thunder God Warrior, almost from the day of his ascension to Second Earth in 1908. He didn\u2019t want to leave behind the men who had held his loyalty all these decades. Besides, he couldn\u2019t always control his dark power and more than anything he feared hurting or killing someone, other than the enemy, by using it as a weapon on a regular basis.</p><p>\u201cYou may not get a say in this,\u201d Luken said. Built like a tank, he led the What-Bees, as the Warriors of the Blood were known among the Militia Warriors.</p><p>He had blue eyes and long blond hair, extra-long like all the What-Bees, and caught back in the required clasp called the cadroen. Women followed him around the Blood and Bite, taking care of his needs with little more than a snap of his fingers.</p><p>Samuel opened his mouth to explain, but Jean-Pierre, usually good-natured, stepped toward him and got right in his face. \u201cYou goddamned motherfucker!\u201d The words sounded so strange spoken in his French accent. \u201cAll these months that I have worked with the Militia Warriors, seeking to build up those with exceptional power, but you never said a word to me or anyone else. I suppose not even to Duncan, who is your friend and who helped you escape.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t blame Duncan. He knew, but he understood my reasons.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFuck those reasons. Merde, how many times did I speak to your section and ask if any warrior had an emerging power that he wanted brought forward, developed? And this is what you have had all the time? Were you laughing at me, warrior?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Fuck, no.\u201d Samuel took a step back, horrified that Jean-Pierre would accuse him of such a thing.</p><p>\u201cI am pissed past speaking the words!\u201d Jean-Pierre\u2019s nostrils flared.</p><p>\u201cHow could you have held back this tremendous power that I have just witnessed, so dark and so beautiful, like a flow of smoke and mist around you? Or do you not understand that even though Greaves is gone, we still have a terrible war threatening our entire world?\u201d He grunted his exasperation and without waiting for a response, he lifted his right arm and vanished.</p><p>Samuel turned to meet Luken\u2019s gaze, wanting to explain, but the usually affable warrior shook his head, and muttered, \u201cYou\u2019ll be hearing from us.\u201d He also lifted his arm, the signal for a fold, and vanished.</p><p>Samuel stood very still, distressed that he hadn\u2019t been given a chance to explain. The warriors viewed him as having let down the war effort, but he knew what he risked each time he released the dark power .</p> <p>And how the hell could Jean-Pierre have described it as beautiful?</p><p>As his dark power began to recede, and the attending smoky mist that came out of his body, evaporated, Samuel pivoted to glare at Santiago. He waited for the warrior to say something, and so he did.</p><p>\u201cIncoming.\u201d The air turned arctic and Samuel shifted his gaze to the night sky as another eight more death vampires descended out of the inter-dimensional trough, that nether-space between dimensions, sent by a Second Earth general of vast power.</p><p>\u201cHermano, \u201d Santiago said. \u201cYou probably should summon that bad-shit of yours again because I have one slight problemo.\u201d He pivoted to show Samuel the deep skin burn he had along the back of his left calf. The warriors, Militia or otherwise, called any cut a skin burn, unless it incapacitated movement. Blood still seeped from Santiago\u2019s wound, trickling down his calf and into his leather battle sandal.</p><p>Samuel reached down deep and once more let the darkness come. As the bastards landed in the dirt, all fresh and ready to go, he added, \u201cBring it, assholes.\u201d Santiago offered him a smile, full of white teeth. He looked back at the first beautiful death vampire and jerked a thumb in Samuel\u2019s direction. \u201cWhat mi hermano said.\u201d</p><p>Vela Stillwell sat straight up in bed and planted a palm between sweat- slickened breasts.</p><p>A nightmare that wasn\u2019t a nightmare.</p><p>She set a stream of curses rippling the air and leaving behind tiny little fireworks\u2014one of her more exalted powers that she kept hidden. Normally, the sparkling lights made her smile, but right now she was pissed as hell.</p> <p>She didn\u2019t want this, more power than she\u2019d ever asked to have and a connection to another Militia Warrior.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know the man in her dreams, but he had a darkness about him that both frightened her and left her feeling weak in a womanish way, like she wanted to be with him, wanted to be under him.</p><p>The vision, or whatever it was, had taken place in the desert and the warrior had been battling out at the Superstitions.</p><p>He\u2019d helped out a Warrior of the Blood, the super-sexy Santiago that had half the women at HQ racing to the workout center whenever it was known he would be running sword drills with the Thunder God Warriors.</p><p>Vela avoided the workout center.</p><p>The last thing she wanted was to hook up with another warrior. She\u2019d loved and lost a man of the sword and she couldn\u2019t go through it again. So, when the women at lunch got to talking about who looked particularly hot in a battle kilt these days, she\u2019d usually make an excuse and head back to her desk early, on the opposite side of the building, where she worked crunching numbers, paying invoices, and reviewing purchase orders.</p><p>She\u2019d been widowed five years now, but it still felt like yesterday since Jeff was killed in the line of duty, while battling death vampires at the Awatukee Borderland.</p><p>Waking up, therefore, with weird dreams about a warrior she didn\u2019t know, but who appealed to her in an erotic, primal way, chapped her hide especially since today would be her last day at HQ.</p><p>She\u2019d finally decided to leave the Apache Junction Two compound so she wouldn\u2019t have to be around the whole Militia Warrior camp. She wanted a fresh start and next week she\u2019d take up her new job as a counselor at the rehab center where she\u2019d be working with Fiona, Warrior Jean-Pierre\u2019s mated breh, helping to rehabilitate former blood slaves.</p><p>She checked her bedroom clock. It was already half past five. She got up and worked out for an hour, something she\u2019d done since Jeff died. The exertion kept her sane.</p><p>She dressed in her usual dark slacks, light blue silk blouse, and low heels. She let her unruly, and very thick, long blond hair flow free, ignoring all the errant curls, letting the uncontrolled mass be a sign of the change to come, that after today she\u2019d begin a new, less restricted life.</p><p>She folded to the HQ landing platforms, on time as usual, and went to work, sitting in her office and processing purchase orders for all kinds of weaponry, uniforms, and electronic equipment. Over the past several weeks, the latter had become an almost constant stream of acquisitions for Warrior Thorne, the Supreme High Commander of the Allied Ascender Forces. He\u2019d set up a working HQ, a Command Center, at Madame Endelle\u2019s palace during the time preceding the battle at White Lake that saw Greaves\u2019s defeat, and he\u2019d continued building up his operations since.</p><p>Now, apparently, he had a new set of problems.</p><p>Vela always got a headache thinking about the turn in the war. What had begun as a great victory and celebrated throughout the world as a resounding defeat had already taken on the shape of a nightmare. Three of Greaves\u2019s generals, as a contingency plan to his failure to win his mano-a-mano battle against Madame Endelle, had essentially taken their master\u2019s army, hiding over three-hundred- thousand troops each, which added up to almost a million warriors, and had subsequently begun launching guerilla-like attacks against Thorne\u2019s AAF.</p><p>The body count among the Thunder God Warriors had hit numbers that forced her to avoid certain websites and newsfeeds.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t get away from all of this chaos soon enough.</p><p>She glanced at her computer and saw that it was now ten-after-five. She was officially done and could say adios to HQ forever.</p><p>Yes, a new life awaited her and she chomped at the bit to get started.</p><p>Of course, she only had three purchase orders left to process, and since she couldn\u2019t stand the thought of leaving the task undone, she kept working. What was twenty more minutes?</p><p>But as she prepared to print-out a hard copy of a particularly troublesome document, she heard a familiar group- giggling sound and she smiled.</p><p>Her time was up.</p><p>\u201cShut it down, Ascender Vela. You no longer work here.\u201d She looked up and saw her three closest friends, looking young and chic, grouped in her doorway. She loved her world that at least two of her friends were over a hundred but didn\u2019t look a day past thirty. Sweet.</p><p>As she did a double-take, she realized each wore a silly grin.</p><p>Suspicion set in.</p><p>\u201cAll right, what\u2019s going on?\u201d she called out. She closed the last file and signed off. Despite that her friends were clearly up to something, a deep sigh of relief left her. Her tour of duty at Militia Warrior HQ was officially over.</p><p>She stood up and grabbed her purse.</p><p>\u201cWell, we\u2019re definitely taking you out for drinks,\u201d Donna said. \u201cBut first, have we got a surprise for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d She grinned. \u201cI hope it involves a cake with that really bad-for- you, sugary-white frosting, because I\u2019m in.\u201d When she reached the door, Bev and Chris flanked her left side, and Donna, who shared HQ grid-work with Bev, took her right.</p><p>\u201cThis has nothing to do with that kind o f cake,\u201d Donna said. \u201cBut it is cake, if you get my drift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs in beefcake,\u201d Chris drawled.</p><p>Vela stalled out and couldn\u2019t make her feet move. \u201cPlease don\u2019t tell me we\u2019re going to the workout center.\u201d Anything but that.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes we are,\u201d Bev said. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard it on the grapevine that someone special is being brought in, a warrior we\u2019ve been hearing rumors about for the past several months but have never seen. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He\u2019s the one Duncan helped rescue from that weird prison cell in Honduras Two, where he\u2019d been tortured.\u201d She lowered her voice. \u201cApparently, he did something last night out at the Superstition Borderland that has all the What-Bees in an uproar. For one thing, he really pissed off Warrior Luken and you know how good-natured he is.\u201d Vela started getting that really bad feeling that Bev\u2019s description matched the man from her nightmare and her heart rate cranked up a notch. What if this was him?</p><p>What if she walked into the workout center and there he was? Wouldn\u2019t it mean something? Wouldn\u2019t the preternatural nature of the situation demand that she do something?</p><p>Her heart sank. She didn\u2019t want a connection with another warrior, not any kind of connection.</p> <p>\u201cPlease, can\u2019t we skip this? In fact, why don\u2019t we all go out to dinner? I have a friend who works at the White Lake Resort Colony. I\u2019m sure I can get us into any number of restaurants over there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, no,\u201d Donna said, as Chris and Bev nudged her along. \u201cBefore you leave HQ permanently, we want you to enjoy a bit of eye-candy, because, girl, locked away in the rehab center, you\u2019re going to die of man-starvation. At least here at HQ, you get to see Militia Warriors coming and going, but there? You\u2019ll be lucky to see a man once a decade.\u201d Which was exactly what she wanted.</p><p>She took a deep breath. \u201cFine.\u201d She only had to get through the next half hour or so then she\u2019d never be back here, never be tempted by something she really, really, didn\u2019t want in her life.</p><p>Samuel woke up from the night\u2019s battling with an urgent message from Carla, who worked the daytime shift at Central, to get his ass over to the workout center. Essentially the higher ups had their panties in a wad about what went down at the Superstitions last night and wanted to chat with him.</p><p>And Endelle would be there.</p> <p>Which of course meant that Thorne would be on deck as well.</p><p>Yeah, he was pretty much screwed.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>He shaved and showered as fast as he could, but he ached from head-to-foot.</p><p>Releasing the dark power had forced him to work a whole bunch of muscles he swore he\u2019d never used before. Even his speedy vampire healing had taken its sweet time fixing things up.</p><p>Santiago met him at the landing platforms, a smirk on his lips.</p> <p>\u201cWhy the workout center?\u201d Samuel knew that crowds often gathered to watch Jean-Pierre train the Militia Warriors who had emerging powers. He so didn\u2019t want to be there, on display. Jesus.</p><p>But Santiago slung his arm around Samuel\u2019s neck, squeezed, then laughed at him. \u201cThorne wants a demonstration.</p><p>Besides, that much power, hermano? We need you on board and Thorne will have your cojones if you don\u2019t join up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSi. Mucho fuck.\u201d This time, Samuel laughed. He took long strides and Santiago joined him. They both wore flight battle gear, getting ready to head out for the night. He also knew that Santiago often stopped off at the Blood and Bite first, meeting up with the What- Bees before a night of battle. Hell, he might even head there himself. After facing off with Thorne, he\u2019d probably need a drink afterward and definitely some action in the red velvet booths.</p><p>As he reached the doorway of the workout center, Luken waved him over.</p><p>The leader of the What-Bees stood with Thorne, Madame Endelle, and Jean- Pierre.</p><p>But if that wasn\u2019t bad enough, a combination of civilians and warriors now packed all four risers that ran the length of the west wall. He\u2019d never been to the center himself during office hours, but he\u2019d heard tales that once Warrior Jean-Pierre had started working with the Militia Warriors, some of the civilian staff at HQ, and an equal number of warriors took time out to watch the training sessions. \u201cAre there usually this many people at the workouts?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, hermano. This is all for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d So the rumors had been rolling. Great.</p><p>Neither Colonel Seriffe nor Gideon were present since their current joint duties included running mass Militia Warrior training exercises in North Africa.</p><p>Extensive surveillance had delivered up the strong possibility that one of Greaves\u2019s generals had a base of operations out there.</p><p>Luken\u2019s grim expression didn\u2019t help.</p><p>The brother generally had a calm disposition. But not right now.</p><p>Thorne glared at Samuel, his arms crossed over his chest. Though he spent most of his time at the palace Command Center, he still wore flight battle gear.</p><p>Jean-Pierre ground his molars and didn\u2019t make eye contact.</p><p>Endelle stared at him with raised brows, clearly more curious than pissed.</p><p>She wore a typical, off-the-rails outfit, this time with some kind of sheer tunic that hung to her knees, covered on top by a massive necklace around her throat that descended almost to her waist, made up of hundreds of small spiral white seashells.</p><p>Snug leopard pants showed through the tunic. Her black stiletto boots gave her several inches on Thorne. And to top it off, literally, she wore a crown made up of electric-blue, bird feathers and some kind of fuzzy yellow thing in the middle.</p><p>Vintage, Endelle. She looked perpetually ready for mardis gras.</p><p>But as he passed by the risers, his steps slowed. A funny kind of scent wafted in his direction, very light and floral, even sweet. Perfume, maybe. And somewhere in the back of his head he knew that scent, as though nothing more important existed. He might even have stopped but the fragrance faded so he continued his march.</p><p>Given the audience, he hoped Luken intended to take the conversation to the conference room, but the moment he drew within fifteen feet, Thorne started in.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell have you got to say for yourself, warrior, that you would hold back this kind of power, when you know how desperately we need Warrior of the Blood capacity right now? Santiago gave a full report before turning in early this morning. What the fuck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe power I have,\u201d Samuel stated as forcefully as he could, \u201cisn\u2019t stable.</p><p>When it first emerged, it killed several innocent men, slaves I think. And I only allowed it out last night because it was either that, or watch those pretty-boys swamp Santiago.\u201d He frowned. \u201cAnd despite the fact that I felt in control, which is something I freely admit, I also know that there\u2019s an uncontrollable side to whatever the hell this is. I don\u2019t want anybody else dead because of it. And that\u2019s the goddamn truth!\u201d Thorne rubbed a hand over his brow.</p><p>\u201cOkay, that\u2019s reasonable answer. But, shit, we need you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>\u201cWhen did this power emerge?\u201d Endelle asked.</p><p>His gaze shifted away from her, away from all of them. He didn\u2019t want to think about it, didn\u2019t want to remember.</p><p>He took a deep breath. \u201cWhile I was hanging from ropes in that prison cell in Honduras Two. That\u2019s one reason I\u2019ve never trusted this power. It\u2019s dark, it came from my hatred of my torturers.\u201d Endelle shook her head a couple of times. \u201cListen up, warrior.\u201d She angled her thumb toward Jean-Pierre. \u201cYou need to put yourself in JP\u2019s hands, and start trusting some of the What-Bees, that maybe they\u2019d be able to handle this dark- ass power of yours and help you gain control of the rest of it.\u201d He opened his mouth to argue with her, but she shushed him. \u201cCh-ch-ch! Not a word, asshole. You\u2019ve been holding out and we\u2019re all pissed as hell. We\u2019ve got a full-blown war on our hands and the Borderlands have expanded with activity every goddamn night. So, this isn\u2019t a discussion. You will work with Jean- Pierre and you will like it. Do we understand each other?\u201d He nodded. \u201cYes, Madame Endelle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Now someone tell him about Duncan. I\u2019m outta here.\u201d She lifted her arm, and much to everyone\u2019s dismay she folded straight out of room, which set the alarms shrieking. Luken already had his phone to his ear and a few seconds later, the alarms shut down. No one folded in or out of Militia HQ, without express permission, except by way of the multiple landing platforms.</p><p>Once his ears stopped ringing, he focused his attention on Luken. \u201cWhat about Duncan?\u201d The warrior was one of Samuel\u2019s few good friends and had helped him to escape his captivity a year ago.</p><p>Luken met his gaze squarely.</p><p>\u201cDuncan\u2019s missing. We don\u2019t know where he is, or what happened to him. He disappeared while battling at the New River Borderland two nights ago. There\u2019d been so many teams folding in and out of the space that it took almost twenty-four hours before we concluded he\u2019s now MIA.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Samuel\u2019s chest tightened.</p><p>\u201cBut how the fuck is that possible?\u201d Duncan was an extremely powerful Militia Warrior and one of two dozen who had been working with Jean-Pierre to bring his What-Bee powers on line. In recent weeks, Duncan had confided that he\u2019d been having visions, similar to those Elise Jordan experience, but he\u2019d know more in the coming months.</p><p>Samuel hadn\u2019t seen him in over a week since Duncan\u2019s responsibilities as a Section Leader for the Thunder God Warriors kept him damn busy. Samuel had never been much for socializing in any significant way, preferring battle and clubbing, but he considered Duncan a good friend who had helped keep him sane during the past year, as he adjusted to his return to Militia Warrior service.</p><p>He was just about to ask what he could do to help, when that scent came to him again, this time much stronger, a river of fragrance that started wrapping around him. He even turned in the direction of the risers, though uncertain why.</p><p>He sniffed the air, and drew more of the flowery scent into his nostrils, which in turn invaded his brain. A strange dizziness descended.</p><p>What the hell was that?</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>Vela\u2019s gaze had narrowed to a fine point that encompassed the warrior from her nightmare who had saved Santiago, the one called Samuel, the one now turned in the direction of the risers, a furrow between his brows as he scanned the crowd.</p><p>From the time he had passed by the risers, some kind of ascended knowing had possessed her, as though she already knew this man. He looked made for war in battle gear, and whether he realized it or not, he had a Warrior of the Blood thing going on with his black hair long and bound in a leather strap. He had moved like war and grace combined, a lethal fluid stride surrounded by a dark aura, and her body had bloomed for him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIsn\u2019t he gorgeous?\u201d Donna whispered.</p><p>Vela couldn\u2019t respond. She wanted to, she wanted to expound on Donna\u2019s theme, but her vocal chords wouldn\u2019t work.</p><p>The strangest part of all, however, was that she swore she could smell him, that a stream of something warm, male, and wonderfully bitter like dark chocolate, emanated from him.</p> <p>The scent filtered through her nostrils and began to drift into other parts of her body. Her thoughts funneled down farther to the warrior as though nothing else in this room existed and when his searching gaze found her, something really strange happened: she heard his thoughts like a soft whisper through her mind, She\u2019s the one. She\u2019s mine.</p><p>She felt naked beneath his gaze, and the stream of his scent thickened as he took several steps toward the risers. Her lips parted and she shifted in her seat like she couldn\u2019t get comfortable. Her breasts felt heavy and achy. Her nipples beaded and pleasure descended very low until her breath hitched and the deepest part of her began long hard pulls on something that wasn\u2019t there, but needed to be there, the sooner the better.</p><p>She felt bathed in pleasure and all she\u2019d done was catch Samuel Daman\u2019s scent and meet his gaze.</p><p>You\u2019re mine. Samuel sent the thought again, straight at the woman in the risers, the one with a mass of wild, long blond hair, and large blue eyes.</p><p>A wave of her delicate floral scent hit him, and his breath caught. Her perfume affected the nerves in his body.</p> <p>Streaks of lightning shot down his arms and legs, firing up his muscles. His neck grew almost rigid. His back started to arch and harsh sounds formed in his throat. He felt his dark power rise, and his mist started to swirl around him.</p><p>He took another deep breath through his nostrils. The perfume wafted in, and a new fire lit up his brain. He had to get to this woman.</p><p>She stood up and reached a hand toward him.</p><p>His vision tunneled down to the tips of those fingers. What happened next became a blur. He ran or levitated or partially folded to her position, he wasn\u2019t sure, then grabbed her and pulled her out of the crowd, holding her against him and hauling her off the risers.</p><p>The alarms started shrieking as did several of the ascenders in the risers, though he didn\u2019t know why.</p><p>A thundering followed.</p> <p>Maybe he heard Luken\u2019s voice.</p><p>HQ must be under attack, though he didn\u2019t see the enemy, just the room moving in a strange way.</p><p>Still holding the woman in his arms, the one he had to get to safety, had to protect with every ounce of his being, he folded her to the corner of the room behind a weightlifting machine. He released her then ordered her to hunker down. He turned around to face the room, folding his identified sword into his right hand, his dagger to his left, ready to take the enemy on, to battle ten, a hundred, a thousand death vampires if necessary to keep his woman safe.</p><p>His dark mist rose in swirls around him, that part of his power he could control. He shifted on his feet, turning in an arc. Let the enemy come.</p><p>The alarms stopped suddenly.</p><p>The workout center had emptied of spectators, which would make it easier to battle what came at him. But Endelle had returned and the other warriors seemed strangely relaxed. None of them bore a sword in hand, which made no sense.</p><p>His vision was still off, even a little blurred.</p><p>\u201cSo this is what Santiago was telling us about,\u201d Endelle called from across the room. \u201cLook how much more defined his muscles are, bigger, too. And that mist is some bad-ass shit! Holy motherfucker.\u201d Samuel stayed in his battle pose, sword aloft, dagger ready.</p> <p>\u201cStand down, warrior,\u201d Luken commanded. \u201cYou\u2019re among friends. No enemy here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard the alarms,\u201d he shouted, unwilling to relax his guard. His woman was behind him and needed to be protected at all costs, even if he died doing it.</p><p>More strange things happened: Thorne started to smile, then laugh. Jean- Pierre followed, which made Samuel completely uncertain about what was happening. These were Warriors of the Blood, all three men, and now Luken grinned and Santiago shook his head.</p><p>\u201cFold those damn weapons away,\u201d Endelle shouted, \u201cbefore you hurt the woman behind you. Aw fuck.\u201d She turned to Thorne. \u201cYou deal with this goddamn breh-hedden shit.\u201d She lifted her arm and though all four warriors tried to stop her, she folded and the alarms started shrieking again. Luken once more got on his phone and seconds later, the alarms stopped, but he stayed on the phone. After about a minute, he called out, \u201cSamuel, get rid of your weapons.</p><p>This is a false alarm. Apache Two is locked down and I just got clearance for you to fold your sword and dagger out of here. Now do it.\u201d Samuel\u2019s head finally began to clear so that he could see Luken was right. He released his weapons, folding them back to his weapons locker. He still didn\u2019t understand what had happened. His brain had slipped into some kind of overdrive that made no sense.</p><p>\u201cAre you Samuel?\u201d The voice, his woman\u2019s voice , played a soft melody over his ears. As he turned, she rose from the floor where he\u2019d pushed her down to make sure she was safe.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m Samuel.\u201d He stared into large, dark blue eyes, her light floral scent still swirling in his head and fracturing his thoughts.</p><p>He forgot about where he was as he stepped toward her, dragged her against his chest, and kissed her. Her arms flowed easily around his neck. Nothing had ever felt more natural or more right.</p><p>He had to taste her, to see if the floral scent also had a flavor, and it did.</p><p>She moaned as he drove his tongue into her mouth, pushing and seeking, savoring.</p><p>He wanted his tongue between her legs doing the same thing. Then his cock. He wanted his mouth on her winglocks, sucking, his fangs striking her neck and her blood down his throat.</p><p>He arched his hips into her so that she could feel his arousal and all that he had to offer, all that he intended to give her right now.</p><p>Vela drove her fingers into Samuel\u2019s thick black hair as he pummeled her mouth. She lived in a dream, one that swirled this way then that, like she was caught in a dizzying carnival ride, and she couldn\u2019t get enough.</p><p>She wanted more, to feel him inside her, low and deep. She ached between her legs, needing him.</p><p>Even her vein throbbed. She grabbed one of his hands and put it to her throat.</p><p>He groaned as he stroked her neck and her vein rose for him.</p><p>She arched her neck, she felt him shift, she even felt saliva as he bathed her throat with his tongue. He would strike soon. His fangs would pierce her throat.</p><p>She was so close.</p><p>Then suddenly everything shifted. At least three warriors were on Samuel, pulling him away from her.</p><p>Vela shouted at them. \u201cWhat are you doing? Stop this. He\u2019s mine. He belongs to me.\u201d Samuel started roaring at the ceiling, and more of his beautiful dark mist poured off his skin swirling in the air. She drank it in as Luken and Santiago hauled him backward. He fought like a madman but the men were vampire strong and held him.</p><p>She struggled to get to him only then realizing that someone held her back.</p><p>\u201cMon dieu, cherie, please stop fighting me. We have to separate you just for this moment. I beg you.\u201d Jean-Pierre, the beautiful Frenchman had her trapped. But why?</p><p>She shoved elbows into him and finally whirled and scratched at him.</p><p>Every time Samuel let out another roar, she fought harder.</p><p>\u201cThorne,\u201d Jean-Pierre called out.</p><p>\u201cWe need Alison here. This is not right.</p><p>Vela cannot calm down and I fear hurting her.\u201d She saw her opportunity and kneed Jean-Pierre hard. He grunted, doubled over, and suddenly she was free.</p><p>She raced, folded, then landed on Samuel, throwing her arms around him.</p><p>Her weight, combined with his, took him to the floor. The other warriors reached for him again as the alarms once more shrieked. She didn\u2019t understand all that was happening, but she had her man in her arms and held onto him.</p><p>When Thorne reached down for her, she hissed, long and loud and formed a spider-like pose over Samuel. Luken\u2019s face looked like a hurricane had hit him.</p><p>Thorne said, \u201cWell this is new.\u201d Vela understood exactly what had to be done and with a thought, she took Samuel into that dreamy place where she\u2019d lived the recent nightmare, dark around the edges, but still in the workout center. At least now, Samuel was safe.</p><p>She still spidered over him, but she scanned the area beyond the boundaries of the dark space. Behind her, Jean-Pierre stood bent over, his hands on his knees, his face red. In front of her, Luken, Thorne, and Santiago stood in an arc, looking confused. It seemed clear to her that though she had a perfect view of all of them, they couldn\u2019t see her.</p><p>The dreamy place allowed her to see out yet remain unseen. Exactly what she needed.</p><p>Luken shook his head. \u201cShit, she folded Samuel out of here.\u201d But Thorne, who had power-on- power, stood back and surveyed where they\u2019d just been. \u201cNo. She didn\u2019t. Neither did he. I can sense both of them. They\u2019re still here. Well, what do you know; they\u2019re in the darkening. \u201d</p><p>\u201cQue?\u201d Santiago said.</p><p>\u201cThe darkening? That is serious shit. You think Samuel has that kind of power, jefe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Thorne said, peering in her direction but not making eye contact because apparently he still couldn\u2019t see her; he just knew or sensed she was there.</p><p>\u201cI think Vela does. All right, forget Alison, we need Havily over here right now.\u201d Luken whipped his phone to his ear and issued a string of soft, calm orders.</p><p>Vela didn\u2019t care what any of the men did, so long as they backed off and left her man alone.</p><p>She watched Luken shift his gaze to Jean-Pierre, who had remained behind her. Vela spidered, maneuvering sideways so that she could see his approach from the rear, her arms and legs still in a protective arc over Samuel.</p><p>Jean-Pierre hobbled in her direction.</p><p>Oh, that\u2019s right; she\u2019d kneed him hard.</p><p>Exactly what he deserved for keeping her away from Samuel.</p><p>Luken hissed softly. \u201cShe got you in the jewels, brother? Ouch.\u201d She felt something on her cheek and glanced down. Samuel looked at her with a light in his extraordinary gray eyes as he stroked her face with the backs of his fingers. \u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful. What\u2019s your name?\u201d Her need to protect her man, traded places with her desire for him. She\u2019d brought him to safety, still within the workout center, yet not. No one could touch them here. She could keep this warrior with her forever in this place if she had to. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cVela,\u201d she said. \u201cMy name is Vela.\u201d As she eased down onto his chest, and found his lips with her own, as he once more drove his tongue deep inside, she thought forever seemed like too short a time.</p><p>He tasted of smoke and chocolate and man. She felt dizzy and aroused, ready to take things to the next level, when a woman called to her by name, \u201cVela.\u201d Whoever the woman was, she needed her to go away.</p><p>She kept kissing her warrior.</p> <p>\u201cVela, can you hear me?\u201d The woman\u2019s voice sounded familiar, but she was too busy right now to respond. Samuel had his tongue in her mouth and it felt so good. She hadn\u2019t been kissed in years, not in years, and she wanted more, a lot more. She wanted everything. Now.</p><p>\u201cVela,\u201d the woman called again, more stridently this time. \u201cCan you stop what you\u2019re doing for just a quick sec and talk to me?\u201d She had her hands knotted in Samuel\u2019s hair and she didn\u2019t want to talk.</p><p>His hands kneaded her ass and she could feel all his male goodness pressed against her.</p><p>\u201cVela, listen to me. You\u2019re caught in t h e breh-hedden, try to process that.</p><p>You\u2019ve never even met the man you\u2019re kissing right now, have you?\u201d How the hell did the woman know she was kissing Samuel? Even Thorne hadn\u2019t been able to see her.</p> <p>As though having read her mind, the woman added, \u201cI can see you kissing Warrior Samuel. Can you look up at me? I think you\u2019ll be able to see me, too. I\u2019m in the darkening with you. I have this power, as well. Your darkening ability.\u201d Darkening power?</p><p>She felt the urge to protect her man rise up again. She pulled away from Samuel and lifted up once more to half- spider him with one leg arched between his and one arm curved over him, her fingers touching the soft workout mats just past his shoulder.</p><p>She hissed softly, at the intruder, which proved to be a beautiful woman, with red hair, surrounded in a soft glow.</p><p>Of course she knew her, who didn\u2019t? She was Warrior Marcus\u2019s breh.</p><p>But why was the powerful Havily Morgan spying on her, invading her secret space? How had she gotten here?</p><p>Havily stood within the black-edged boundaries of the protective place Vela had created, a glowing presence. \u201cYou need to go away, Havily. I don\u2019t want to hurt you, but you can\u2019t be here. I will die before I let harm come to Samuel.\u201d Samuel\u2019s hand was once more on her face, then on her breast, fondling. Her long hair covered his arm and hand. \u201cCome back to me,\u201d he whispered urgently. \u201cI need you.\u201d She looked down at him. \u201cHavily is here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMake her go away. I need you.\u201d Vela shifted to glare at Havily. \u201cYou need to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will, if you\u2019ll just talk to me for a minute. Otherwise, I\u2019ll have to stay. I\u2019m under orders.\u201d Vela\u2019s arms trembled holding her pose, but she wasn\u2019t about to let anyone get Samuel. He still lay prone, one hand kneading her breast.</p><p>She caught his hand and held it still as her mind cleared a little. Havily had spoken of the darkening. So had Thorne.</p><p>Was this place the darkening? She needed to understand.</p><p>She met Havily\u2019s gaze. \u201cYou can have one minute, then you\u2019ll have to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Havily said. \u201cI have just a few questions. Can you tell me how long you\u2019ve known Warrior Samuel?\u201d Vela looked down at him and smiled.</p><p>\u201cForever.\u201d She heard Havily chuckle. \u201cI know that feeling well. But when did you first meet him?\u201d At that, Vela frowned and looked back at Havily.</p><p>\u201cI...can\u2019t quite remember.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHave you ever met him? I mean, been introduced?\u201d She shook her head. \u201cNo. I don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo when did you first see him then?\u201d Vela leaned back just a little and her thoughts began to come together. \u201cI was sitting on the risers when he walked by.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what happened? May I ask?\u201d She nodded. \u201cI caught this wonderful scent, almost like chocolate, but very male.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t usually tell people this, but my breh, Warrior Marcus, smells like a field of wild grasses combined with fennel.\u201d Vela smiled. Havily understood.</p><p>Havily knew.</p><p>Then she remembered Madame Endelle saying something about the breh- hedden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is the breh-hedden,\u201d Vela said, a rush of understanding ripping through her. \u201cOh, my God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery much so.\u201d Havily held her palms up. \u201cI went through something similar with Marcus during those early days. Luken dragged Marcus off of me and Antony held me back. It was...horrible.</p><p>But later, I was completely mortified. I\u2019m saying this so that you\u2019ll know you\u2019re not alone in what you\u2019re probably feeling right now, or what you will soon experience.\u201d Vela shifted her spidery arm and leg so that now she knelt beside Samuel. Her heart started pounding and her cheeks felt fiery hot. \u201cOh, my God. No.\u201d She shifted away from Samuel, who sat up and stared at her not with lust, but with a puzzled expression. The dimming of her possessive, sexual feelings seemed to be having an effect on him.</p><p>Havily\u2019s presence had done what otherwise would have been impossible.</p><p>She\u2019d essentially stopped them from having sex, in the darkening, right in the middle of the Apache Junction Two Militia Warrior Headquarters workout center.</p><p>She scooted back on her knees.</p><p>\u201cWarrior Samuel, oh, my God. I don\u2019t know what happened.\u201d Havily was right about one thing; Vela didn\u2019t know him at all.</p><p>And she was mortified beyond words.</p><p>He reached his hand toward her but let it fall away before he made contact. \u201cI am so sorry,\u201d he said. \u201cThe need of the moment overwhelmed me. Jesus.\u201d But as she looked into his eyes, the power of the breh-hedden began to descend on her once more, especially as another wave of his erotic chocolate scent swamped her.</p><p>His gray eyes grew wild once more.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said, his gaze smoldering, boring into her. She felt herself falling back into the experience, as though to do anything else would be to defy the heavens.</p><p>\u201cVela,\u201d Havily called sharply.</p><p>She drew in a deep breath and shifted her gaze back to Havily. \u201cOh, dear God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be okay. That\u2019s it. Just breathe. And if you can move away, it will be even better for you, or at least easier.\u201d Vela scooted a few feet back on the mats. She reminded herself that she didn\u2019t know this man and that he was the last thing she wanted in her life: a warrior.</p><p>She closed her eyes and forced air deep into her lungs. After a moment, when she opened them, she spoke to Havily.</p><p>\u201cCould you give us a minute? We need to sort this out?\u201d Havily nodded and disappeared, though a faint glow, like a trace, remained behind, an after-signature.</p><p>\u201cIf we\u2019re going to talk,\u201d Samuel said, \u201cI\u2019ll need more distance. I\u2019m barely holding on here because all I can think about is pulling you into my arms.\u201d She jumped to her feet because if she didn\u2019t she\u2019d let him do whatever he wanted to do.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he said. He crossed his legs, his kilt looped into his lap. He stared at the black mats on the floor then shaded his face with one hand. \u201cJesus H. Christ,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>She took another step away from him, but couldn\u2019t keep from staring at him. He was incredibly handsome with strong cheekbones angling to an equally powerful jaw. His nose had a slight curve, maybe not as marked as Warrior Santiago\u2019s, but for her much more appealing.</p><p>Samuel. The word floated through her mind. She caressed his name again, Samuel.</p><p>He looked up at her. Telepathy?</p><p>Her cheeks grew warm again. Yes.</p><p>You heard me call your name?</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>You spoke into my mind earlier, she sent. You called me your woman.</p><p>At that he shook his head, and with his forearms resting on his knees, he said, \u201cI only vaguely remember. The moment you stood up, I had to go to you, to get to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201c T h e breh-hedden.\u201d She said the word out loud so that she could start making sense of it. The call to him was still there, a ferocious beast that for now she had caged, but she\u2019d never felt anything like this, like she had to be with him, be near him, touch him, take him into her body in as many different ways as she could, and do it now.</p><p>At the same time, she felt compelled to tell him of her dream. \u201cI saw you battle last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how, but I think I was in the darkening and I felt called to the Superstitions. I watched the battle, how you saved Santiago. I just didn\u2019t know who you were.\u201d She told him several details of the terrible encounter, that he hadn\u2019t been in wing-mount, and that he\u2019d used both levitation and folding skills to slay the enemy.</p><p>\u201cMy God,\u201d he said. \u201cDo you do this often? I mean do you have these kinds of visions about other warriors?\u201d Her heart sank. \u201cNever. This was the first time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019re connected somehow.\u201d His jaw worked a couple of times. He pressed his lips into a grim line.</p><p>Unfolding his legs, he rose , towering over her not just with his height but with his powerful physique. She was five ten, so she wasn\u2019t exactly short for a woman, but he made her feel petite.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry,\u201d he said, his brows pinched once more. \u201cI won\u2019t come after you. I\u2019ll leave you alone.\u201d She sensed a deeper meaning behind his words, behind his intention, that he\u2019d just spoken his natural state, his isolation.</p><p>What had her friends told her earlier, that Samuel never came to the workout center, that he\u2019d been held captive for a decade and tortured, that though he was back, serving the Militia Warriors, he essentially kept to himself?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure that would be for the best.\u201d Yet doubt squirmed.</p><p>The past few years suddenly ripped through her mind. She realized that what had just happened between them, this sudden onslaught of the breh-hedden, had somehow illuminated what now looked like her dreary existence.</p><p>And yet, she didn\u2019t want a man like Samuel in her life, never again. She and Jeff had been married for over six decades and all that time, day in and day out, she\u2019d lived with the possibility that he would die in the line of duty. Then the night had come when he\u2019d been ambushed by death vampires and her life with him had ended. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She hated the war, its seemingly endless nature. Even getting rid of Greaves had only shifted the ongoing conflict and in some ways had made it worse. In one month, the activity at all the Metro Phoenix Two Borderlands had quadrupled, putting heavy pressure on those warriors assigned to Borderland duty.</p><p>\u201cThis was my last day at HQ,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m transferring to Fiona\u2019s rehab center to begin my counseling internship. I start next week.\u201d At that, he met her gaze. She knew the tight set of her lips matched his now.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cYou\u2019ll be doing important work.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat I did here was important work, just different.\u201d She drew a deep breath and straightened her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m committed to building a new life for myself and that doesn\u2019t include connecting with warriors on any level. I\u2019m...I\u2019m not built for this. Do you understand?\u201d He nodded and his frown deepened.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She believed they\u2019d reached an understanding. \u201cBut I\u2019ll probably have to touch you to take you out of this place.\u201d Her instincts told her that much.</p><p>\u201cSo where are we exactly? Do you know?\u201d Vela thought about Havily and all that she\u2019d said. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure we\u2019re in the darkening.\u201d He whistled. \u201cYou have that kind of power?\u201d She shrugged. \u201cApparently, but I\u2019m not happy about it.\u201d At that, he smiled, a kind of weary smile that squeezed her heart. He huffed a sigh. \u201cI can relate,\u201d he said. \u201cOh, boy, can I relate.\u201d In this moment, she knew two things; Samuel was too damn attractive and she actually liked him.</p><p>Without giving him a warning, she closed the distance between them, grabbed hold of his arm, and took him on a quick ride out of their hiding place.</p> <p>She released him at once, letting her hand fall to her side. She flexed her fingers several times but other than that, she didn\u2019t move away from him. She felt a powerful need to remain close.</p><p>Everyone had left except Havily, Jean-Pierre, and Luken.</p><p>Luken then gave the orders. \u201cVela, we\u2019d like you to go with Havily and talk this over with her, even take a couple of trips into the darkening and explore this power with her.\u201d His gaze shifted to Samuel and he drew in a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve persuaded Thorne and Endelle to back off a little. I reminded Thorne that when Marguerite left Second Earth he actually abandoned his post to follow her.</p><p>But we both agree on one thing, that you need to work with Jean-Pierre and get this power of yours figured out. You already know that one of Jean-Pierre\u2019s gifts is facilitation, so will you at least agree to work with him?\u201d Vela glanced up at Samuel. He met her gaze briefly, but his jaw looked pretty stiff. \u201cI\u2019ll do what I can,\u201d he said, \u201cbut if I feel anyone\u2019s in danger from the nature of my power, I\u2019m out of here.\u201d Warrior Luken opened his mouth to speak, but apparently rethought his words because he closed his mouth, nodded, then said, \u201cWe thought when Endelle defeated Greaves that we would enjoy a long period of peace, that, moving forward, our primary tasks would be to dismantle his army and pursue every last death vampire he created to the ends of the earth. Then our job would be done.</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t anticipate three generals off the grid with nearly a million warriors under their different commands. But that\u2019s what we\u2019ve got. One month after the battle at White Lake, and we\u2019re in deeper than ever. You know this.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI do,\u201d Samuel said.</p><p>Luken met his gaze squarely. \u201cDo your best. No leader can ask for more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d Luken\u2019s lips curved. \u201cAnd you always have. Plus, I can think of more than one time you\u2019ve had my back in the field over the past few months.\u201d He glanced at Vela. \u201cWill you do the same, Ascender Vela?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d He smiled softly. \u201cI knew your husband. He was a good man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of your finest,\u201d Vela said, her throat closing up tight.</p><p>Luken nodded several times. \u201cI have to go now. I have assignments to pass out at the Cave.\u201d He glanced from Havily to Jean-Pierre. \u201cIf you\u2019ll report in later, that would be great.\u201d After both Jean-Pierre and Havily nodded their assents, Luken headed toward the doors and the long march to the landing platforms.</p><p>Havily met Vela\u2019s gaze, her eyes full of compassion. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we go to my office at Administrative HQ?\u201d She inclined her head toward the same doors through which Luken had just disappeared. Vela agreed and put her feet in motion. But each step felt strange, like she was leaving something important behind, maybe the most important thing in her long ascended life.</p><p>Samuel\u2019s head had finally cleared, but he was still reeling.</p> <p>The breh-hedden.</p><p>He didn\u2019t get it. Why him?</p><p>Jean-Pierre headed to the closest set of risers and waved Samuel forward to join him. Samuel followed.</p><p>Jean-Pierre sat down then stretched out his long, lean muscular frame by planting his elbows on the riser step behind him and crossing his feet at the ankles. \u201cYou must tell me what is going on with you, Samuel. I have learned something during these months of training so many different Militia Warriors. There are times when only drills and working hard will do, but right now I believe we must talk.\u201d He jerked his head in the direction of the bench to his right.</p><p>Samuel knew this had to be done but he didn\u2019t like it and he was definitely too tense to lean back like Jean-Pierre.</p><p>Instead, he sat forward, his forearms on his knees, his hands clasped together, his thoughts still full of Vela and the breh- hedden, of the last glimpse of her thick, wavy, unruly hair swaying behind her as she walked away.</p><p>He glanced at Jean-Pierre. He thought for sure that the strange vampire mate-bonding that had been making its way through the Warriors of the Blood, would have taken down another What-Bee this time, instead of his own fucked up self. But then Gideon had been struck by the myth and he was still a mere Militia Warrior, although everyone agreed he fought at Warrior of the Blood status.</p><p>But Gideon deserved the accolade, the power. He\u2019d been a leader among the Thunder God Warriors for a long time.</p><p>Samuel only served as support to another Section Leader, and part of that time he\u2019d been roped up, tortured, and now endowed with some kind of power, a portion of which he couldn\u2019t control. He scrubbed a hand over his face. He could have hurt Vela when he released his power. That he hadn\u2019t seemed like some kind of miracle.</p><p>Jean-Pierre spoke forcefully. \u201cTell me about your dark power, mon ami. Tell me what you fear about its nature.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis power,\u201d he began, his gaze dropping to the nearest black mat, \u201ccame out of my captivity, as a direct result of what I went through, how I survived.\u201d His sense of rage and shame descended on him like a waterfall of remembered pain. The experience was a blur of hurt, blood- hunger, and food starvation. He\u2019d blocked out a lot of it, but there were times, especially during the first few months of his release, when he woke up sweating and half out of his mind.</p><p>During the years of his captivity, his survival had required that he grow in strength, but what had come of it was a dark power that he couldn\u2019t control. For the entire last year, while tortured, he\u2019d released the smoky misty from his body, but up until the moment that Duncan showed up, his power had been benign.</p><p>Maybe seeing Duncan had jump- started the other part of his dark power, the uncontrolled part, but he\u2019d never really know. Streams of energy had started to pour from him, in addition to the smoky mist, and through the Creator\u2019s grace he\u2019d been able to warn Duncan to fold the hell out of there. But the slaves, unable to leave the grounds, had perished to the last man and Samuel lived with the guilt of those undeserved deaths.</p><p>He\u2019d always liked the Frenchman, trusted him. For that reason, he told Jean- Pierre everything, his voice low, the words flat as they left his mouth.</p><p>\u201cMerde.\u201d Jean-Pierre shook his head slowly back and forth. \u201cAnd you say when you escaped, these streams of energy reached out and attacked those around you, without discrimination?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the best way to explain it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand now why you held back. I apologize for yelling at you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were just doing your job. The problem is that when I release the mist- based part of my power, I can never feel the streams, so I have no way of knowing what they are or what would cause them to appear.\u201d Still leaning forward, he rubbed the back of his neck. \u201cAnd now the breh- hedden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOui, and now the curse-that-is-not- a-curse. I understand your woman is to work at the rehab center with my breh, with Fiona?\u201d He nodded. He wanted Vela to go on with her plans, to fulfill a dream that had nothing to do with death vampires and darkening work. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see this power developed or utilized.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMais, Samuel,\u201d Jean-Pierre said, his French adding another syllable to his name, \u201cYou cannot deny that you single- handedly saved a Warrior of the Blood last night. So, how can you say your power should not be encouraged, brought forward, strengthened? You battled like a Warrior of the Blood.</p><p>Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but what if I killed someone accidentally. I couldn\u2019t live with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we should work together, you and I, in a controlled space, with no one else around.\u201d He even smiled. \u201cI am not without power myself, so I believe I could take these streams because, as you said, they did not kill immediately, but took some time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I couldn\u2019t stop them. That\u2019s my point. I watched these men die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you let me help you, if I am able? Perhaps this will become more about separating these powers, encouraging the dark mist and accompanying power while perhaps setting shields in place to block the energy streams.\u201d He turned and met Jean-Pierre\u2019s gaze. \u201cThat would be the right place to begin. But are you sure.\u201d Jean-Pierre narrowed his gaze. \u201cIf you feel the streams emerge, warn me, and I will fold.\u201d Samuel rose to his feet. \u201cThen let\u2019s do this thing.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Vela stood with her back to Havily\u2019s office. She stared out at the fading eastern landscape, a view of the desert that stretched for miles beyond the window all the way to the Superstitions and Militia HQ. With her arms crossed over her chest, she withheld a sigh. Even standing here, she could feel Samuel. How was that possible?</p><p>\u201cSo you had a darkening vision of Samuel while dreaming?\u201d Havily asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She didn\u2019t turn around.</p> <p>Havily\u2019s office had glass panes that faced the executive hallway. Too many people had already walked up and down that hall, glancing in to get a look at her. This was a small community, the one made up of powerful ascenders and their support staff, and she wasn\u2019t used to being stared at. \u201cI thought it was just a dream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ve never had them before?\u201d She shook her head. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re powerful,\u201d Havily said.</p><p>\u201cI can feel it in you. Do your powers manifest in other ways?\u201d She told Havily about the fireworks.</p><p>\u201cI love that power. Alison can do that and so can Fiona.\u201d She hoped Havily didn\u2019t ask for a demonstration. She was so not in the mood. A hawk flew over the desert, hunting as the sun sank in the west, maybe a last attempt before nightfall. The death vampires would be heading to the Borderlands soon, ready to do battle as they tried to make their way into the vulnerable Mortal Earth world.</p> <p>\u201cThis is all too much,\u201d Vela said. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why this has happened.\u201d Havily drew close, leaning a shoulder against the thick window. \u201cI know that feeling. Been there. I think more than any other woman who\u2019s gone through this, Vela, I can relate to you because of the darkening ability.\u201d Vela glanced at her. \u201cDo you wish it undone, all this increased power and responsibility?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but that doesn\u2019t have meaning here. I\u2019m so far on the other side of this thing that I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve forgotten half of what I went through, even my anger toward Marcus because he\u2019d absented himself from the war for two-hundred- years.\u201d Vela shifted slightly in Havily\u2019s direction. \u201cAnd the breh-hedden? Do you ever regret that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not even a little, despite the fact that it\u2019s really frustrating at times. But the best I can say is try, if possible, to stay open to the experience, to this new power you\u2019ve got going on. You might surprise yourself and the one thing I can tell you is that you\u2019ll have a different role in this world going forward, one completely unexpected. I mean, I never thought I would work alongside Endelle or that I would have formed this working partnership with Marcus to change the world\u2019s perception of our fearless leader.</p><p>And yet, I believe I\u2019m suited for all of these things, I just didn\u2019t know it.\u201d Vela took a deep breath. \u201cI thought for sure you\u2019d be yelling at me to get on board.\u201d Havily snorted. \u201cThat\u2019s Endelle\u2019s style and you need to be prepared for that.</p><p>She thinks we\u2019re all slackers unless we\u2019re doing what she tells us to do, the moment she says it. She can be tough to take, but after nine-thousand-years of ascended life, stuck here on Second Earth by the Council of Sixth, she\u2019s lost her filters and has no patience, at all. Which is why I insisted that I speak with you and not her.\u201d Vela laughed. \u201cThank you for that.</p><p>I\u2019ve needed some space, some time to think this through.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know. And as for this new power, don\u2019t be surprised if it crashes down on you again. Emerging power is like that, like a series of storms until you\u2019ve mastered what you\u2019ve been given.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, that\u2019s not very comforting.\u201d But she smiled.</p><p>\u201cOne last thing. You do have a choice here. Nothing is set in stone at this point. The next time you\u2019re called by the darkening, and it will probably relate to Samuel because that\u2019s just the way the breh-hedden works, you will have a choice to make. And it will be okay if you choose not to move forward. I mean, you\u2019ve taken night courses for years now in preparation for a counseling career, and you are desperately needed at the rehab center. No one would think less of you for choosing that life.</p><p>\u201cAs for Samuel, well, he\u2019s lived in isolation since he returned from his captivity, and from a long period of being hurt, being tortured, so that\u2019s a whole thing in itself.</p><p>\u201cWhile you were still in the darkening talking to him, I contacted Gideon. Basically, he said that Samuel has always been distant, a lone wolf, if you will. He won\u2019t be an easy man to deal with. Apparently, he\u2019s closest to Duncan, who helped make it possible for him to escape, but even then I would hazard a guess that Samuel keeps him at arm\u2019s length.\u201d Vela knew Havily was right. \u201cI\u2019ve thought about that as well. I\u2019ve felt him, Havily, I\u2019ve felt the loneliness in him and even right now, I can feel him, that he\u2019s at HQ.\u201d She waved her hand in the direction of Apache Junction Two.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s pretty amazing. I didn\u2019t have that with Marcus before we completed the breh-hedden. I think this is unique to you and Samuel. Does he have the same sense of you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell it\u2019s just a different thread in the same tapestry.\u201d Vela nodded and almost at the same time she weaved on her feet as a soft vibration ran through her. She blinked.</p> <p>The vibration felt familiar, like a bell sounding in the distance, a warning maybe.</p><p>\u201cHavily, do you hear that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing unusual. What\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel, no I believe I\u2019m being summoned. I think it\u2019s the darkening.\u201d She heard a telepathic voice, a plea for help.</p><p>Samuel, shit, where the fuck are you? I need your help.</p><p>She grew very still, statue-like. She knew that voice because she\u2019d spoken to the warrior many times over the years and he\u2019d been to her home when Jeff was alive. His on-again, off-again girlfriend, Rachel, had often cried on her shoulder about this man.</p><p>She turned to meet Havily\u2019s gaze.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hearing Duncan; he\u2019s calling for help. Actually, he\u2019s asking for Samuel.</p><p>How is that even possible?\u201d Havily held her hands palms up and shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t know, but I think you may have a more powerful form of the gift than me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do. I feel like the darkening is calling to me, but what do I do? With the previous vision, I\u2019d awakened from a dream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, calm down. Take a deep breath. Focus on Duncan\u2019s voice and just let it come.\u201d Vela nodded and let her thoughts turn fully toward Duncan. The moment she did, she slipped inside the darkening, the same sort of place she\u2019d been with Samuel earlier. Only in this case, she was in Havily\u2019s office and a black border separated the spaces. As she strained to hear Duncan\u2019s voice again, she started moving, then just like that started down a dark tunnel that felt oddly familiar, as though the pattern of the tunnel had already been imprinted on her brain. She moved in a kind of levitation, faster and faster. The tunnels would branch and she always knew which one to take.</p><p>Images flashed by her, of people and places, but she didn\u2019t stop to look. She took tunnel after tunnel, an urgency possessing her. She felt a dimensional shift and she knew that she\u2019d just passed from Second Earth to Third.</p><p>On and on she moved.</p><p>She reached her destination and the same black border framed the space, indicating the darkening boundary.</p><p>She\u2019d landed inside a large, gray- stone prison cell.</p><p>Bound by ropes, a barely recognizable Duncan, wearing only his kilt, hung suspended from a central hook.</p><p>He\u2019d been brutalized, probably tortured.</p><p>His eyes were swollen shut, blood ran down his face, his chest, his sides.</p><p>\u201cDuncan,\u201d she called out. Would he even be able to hear her?</p><p>\u201cVela, is that you? I dreamed about you just now. Are you really there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here. But Duncan, I don\u2019t know what to do for you? I can\u2019t pull you out.</p><p>I\u2019m in the darkening and this is all new to me. What should I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet Samuel. I need him. He...that is, this won\u2019t make sense to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell him that I\u2019ve seen others with the kind of power he has, the kind that he released when I got him out of that hellhole in Honduras Two, that dark mist of his. He\u2019ll know what I mean. And shit, tell him that I think they\u2019re going to execute me in the next couple of days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell him right away and we\u2019ll figure this out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne more thing. You have to tell Rachel. Shit, tell her that I love her and that I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ve been a real dick, pushing her too hard.\u201d In the distance, far away, she heard the sound of an explosion. Her instincts fired up and she knew she had to get out of there, had to leave before someone found her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell her. I will. But I\u2019ll bring Samuel back to you. I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d His body slumped in the ropes. He\u2019d passed out.</p><p>Vela turned around. Her heart slammed in her chest now. Another distant explosion sounded. She put on her speed, heading back the way she\u2019d come, never once questioning which strange dark tunnel to take.</p><p>She heard another explosion, closer.</p><p>She moved faster and slipped through the initial entry point in Havily\u2019s office, where the ascender waited for her, eyes wide.</p><p>Instinctively, she planted both hands on the entry point and focused on sealing up the opening. Energy released from her in warm waves.</p><p>\u201cThe wall is glowing,\u201d Havily cried.</p><p>Vela felt the seal happen and she stepped back just as another explosion sounded just beyond the darkening boundary.</p><p>Then nothing, as though the darkening disappeared.</p><p>She leaned her head against the cool glass, breathing hard. She sensed she was safe, at least for now.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened, Vela?\u201d There was only one answer. \u201cI just found Duncan. He\u2019s on Third Earth.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>After an hour of working with Jean- Pierre, Samuel almost smiled as he extended his hand, yet again, down to the Frenchman. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jean-Pierre lay on his back, grimacing. \u201cAnd these are not energy streams you are hitting me with?\u201d Samuel shook his head. \u201cNot at all.</p><p>Trust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMon dieu, your energy is immense.\u201d Samuel smiled. \u201cI warned you.\u201d Jean-Pierre made a disgusted sound at the back of his throat. He scowled at Samuel\u2019s hand, refused to take it, but this time he struggled to gain his feet instead of hopping back up like he\u2019d been doing. \u201cI confess I am very tired of your power slamming me into these work-out mats.</p> <p>And how you are folding so quickly is beyond what I can comprehend.\u201d The alarms no longer sounded. Jean- Pierre had long since spoken with security and gotten permission for Samuel to fold as often as needed, because utilizing his dark power, while battling, always included a series of folds.</p><p>Jean-Pierre wiped sweat from his brow. Some of his long warrior hair had escaped his cadroen, and clung to his face and neck. He had unusual eyes, dark gray and green or maybe they were blue. He\u2019d been a favorite with the ladies until the breh-hedden brought Fiona, the blood slave, into his life. Now he was all hers.</p><p>The breh-hedden.</p><p>Jesus.</p><p>Jean-Pierre held Samuel\u2019s gaze.</p> <p>\u201cAnd we truly have not tapped the streaming power?\u201d Samuel shook his head. \u201cNo, not even a little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMerde,\u201d Jean-Pierre muttered.</p><p>He turned away from the powerful What-Bee and swiped his sword gently back and forth through the air, watching the blade glimmer beneath the overhead lights. At least he\u2019d come to understand that his power had two separate parts and that this half, which had functioned last night at the Superstitions, now seemed strong and right as he wielded his sword against Jean-Pierre in practice, as he folded, levitated, and worked with his dark mist floating around him.</p><p>But the streaming power remained elusive, perhaps even dormant, not a bad thing in his opinion.</p><p>With his sword held aloft, a vibration reached him, a single call to his dark power. He turned in a slow circle, listening hard, waiting for what he didn\u2019t know.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Jean-Pierre asked.</p> <p>\u201cWhat is happening?\u201d Samuel turned toward him. \u201cJesus, I can feel that something\u2019s wrong, like a vibration in my head. What the hell is that?\u201d But Jean-Pierre just shrugged.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps it is your woman.\u201d He was about to say no, to reject the idea because he didn\u2019t have a woman, when Jean-Pierre\u2019s phone rang. He plucked it from the deep pocket of his workout kilt, and after glancing a the screen, he thumbed then said, \u201cAllo, Havily? Ca va? \u201d He nodded. \u201cI see. When you call the landing platforms, have them fold her here. Oui. Ici. Here. Yes, we can do that for now.\u201d He thumbed his phone, returned it to his pocket, and said, \u201cYour woman is coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d Samuel murmured. He\u2019d already planned on finding a way to avoid Vela, and now she\u2019d be here in a few more seconds. Beyond that, he could feel her distress, which made no sense at all.</p><p>A moment later, she materialized twenty feet away from him, near the risers.</p><p>Unable to prevent himself, he crossed the workout mats on a half-run, folding his sword away at the same time.</p><p>With his dark power flowing in a mist around him he grabbed her arms, holding her fast. \u201cAre you all right? What\u2019s wrong? I can feel that something\u2019s wrong.\u201d But before she could answer, he pulled her against him.</p><p>\u201cSamuel,\u201d she whispered, her voice just a breath of air against his neck.</p><p>Realizing what he\u2019d done, he let go of her, then took a step back. \u201cShit, I\u2019m so sorry, Vela. I didn\u2019t mean to do that. I\u2019m trying. I really am.\u201d Vela put a hand on his arm, and he grew very still. God, the feel of her fingers alone making contact with his skin sent ripples of desire coursing through him.</p> <p>\u201cSamuel, we have a situation. I found Duncan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI located Duncan. I slipped into the darkening and went straight to him.\u201d He called to Jean-Pierre, repeating what she\u2019d just told him.</p><p>Jean-Pierre hurried to join them, which immediately set a new kind of problem in play. He didn\u2019t want the warrior near Vela. He shifted to stand slightly in front of her, lowered his chin, and glared. A soft warning growl sounded at the back of his throat.</p><p>Jean-Pierre raised both hands, and took two steps back but his lips curved.</p><p>Damn the breh-hedden.</p><p>Perhaps more stiffly than he wanted, Samuel shifted to stand beside Vela and slid an arm around her waist. He met her gaze, then sent, I\u2019m sorry. This thing is almost unbearable, but I can\u2019t let him get any closer. Please understand.</p><p>I do. I really do. Her light floral scent, so familiar, began to waft over him and now a second problem surfaced.</p><p>Oh, God, the way you smell.</p><p>I know. This is crazy. Your touch, your nearness, and right now you smell like heaven.</p><p>But at that, he laughed and some of the tension eased out of him. He shifted to face her a little bit more. \u201cHow is that possible, when I\u2019ve been running drills?\u201d Her large blue eyes had darkened and the initial charge of the breh-hedden rushed back at him. The only thing that kept him from dragging her into his arms once more was that Jean-Pierre stood nearby.</p><p>When the brother called out his name in three distinct syllables, Samuel jerked his gaze from Vela.</p><p>\u201cYour woman had a purpose in coming here, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God, yes,\u201d Vela said. \u201cIt\u2019s about Duncan.\u201d She shuddered. \u201cI found him in the darkening, in a series of tunnels that crossed the dimensional trough into Third. He\u2019s in a stone-like facility, bound with ropes. He\u2019s been beaten. I almost didn\u2019t recognize him.\u201d She paled, her eyes widening. \u201cHe has some kind of execution order on his head. He said he won\u2019t last through the next couple of days.\u201d She then relayed what Duncan had said, that he believed Samuel would be able to help him, that he\u2019d seen others on Third with his power, others that released a kind of mist when their power emerged.</p><p>A series of thoughts raced through his head, that his power possessed Third Earth qualities, just as he had thought, that a Third entity held Duncan captive, and that somehow Vela connected him to the Upper Dimension.</p><p>Whatever he\u2019d felt earlier about staying away from Vela, or his reluctance to bring his dark power forward, all seemed to fall away in the face of Duncan\u2019s situation. Maybe if this hadn\u2019t been a time of war, he could make a different choice, one that could allow him to separate from Vela, to keep his unknown, untried powers at bay. But Duncan had saved his life and right now Samuel had only one goal. \u201cWe need to get him out.\u201d And with those words, spoken aloud, he left behind a much simpler life in which he kept to himself and lived out his basic, disconnected warrior life. He didn\u2019t know all that taking this step would mean, but everything in his spirit urged him forward.</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d Vela said.</p><p>\u201cCan you share the location with me in some way? Maybe get me there?\u201d He had no idea if Vela could take him through the tunnel system she\u2019d just described.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Vela looked into smoky-gray eyes and once again felt the train of her thoughts begin to slide away. She was still too vulnerable to the breh-hedden to do much more than step in his direction and plant a hand on his weapons harness, in the center of his chest. He covered that hand and his expression softened. A falling sensation flowed through her, working the hard exterior of her heart, softening what had been closed off for the last several years.</p><p>You\u2019re so beautiful.</p><p>But his deep voice in her head woke her up. He shouldn\u2019t be saying something like that, not when they had a job to do, not when Duncan was in danger.</p><p>She drew back, shivering as she lost connection with him. She looked at anything but him and decided the black mats were the right place for her gaze to land. Her thoughts slowly pulled back together.</p><p>Everything had changed.</p><p>That\u2019s what she knew.</p><p>From the moment she\u2019d seen Duncan bound by ropes and hanging from a hook, her life had shifted on its axis. She had no idea where this journey would take her, but for whatever bizarre reason, she had a specific power that had located one of their missing warriors. She\u2019d never sought this ability. She didn\u2019t even want it.</p><p>But her connection to the darkening had catapulted her into a new world, demanding things of her she\u2019d never imagined doing before. Beyond her emerging power, however, she also let go of her need to keep the war at arm\u2019s length. Yes, she\u2019d lost her husband to that bastard, Greaves, but the war wasn\u2019t over and now it looked like an entity on Third had gotten involved as well.</p><p>\u201cWhy Duncan?\u201d she asked, glancing between the men.</p><p>Jean-Pierre turned toward her.</p><p>\u201cDuncan has power, more than anyone knows. I have been working with him, exploring that power, for many months. He has visions, but we could not isolate the source of the power and bring them forward. Each time we did, though, he grew physically stronger.\u201d Samuel frowned. \u201cDid you have a sense that he was somehow connected to Third Earth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. How could I have? But Duncan knew things, sensed things. There is a connection between the two of you.\u201d Vela drew in a deep breath and met Samuel\u2019s gaze. \u201cI think we should head back into the darkening. I want to try to take you back to him and I\u2019m pretty sure I can. Maybe if you saw him, saw the situation, you could figure out what we need to do.\u201d Samuel dipped his chin. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d She understood the depth of the question, not just that she would be taking him back into the darkening and on a difficult journey, but because he already knew how she felt about all of this, that she didn\u2019t want to be involved.</p><p>She nodded slowly. \u201cI\u2019m sure. My mind\u2019s made up. I\u2019m not especially happy about what\u2019s going on, but I want to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s do it.\u201d But Jean-Pierre intruded. \u201cIt might be wise to engage Endelle at this point. Not only does she have darkening ability but it seems to me, mes amis, that we are talking about Third Earth. If an Upper Dimension has begun meddling in our affairs, then Endelle must know.\u201d Vela nodded briskly. \u201cYou\u2019re right. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Absolutely.\u201d Getting a fold to the palace took Jean-Pierre a couple of phone calls to orchestrate, but finally the three of them glided through nether-space.</p><p>Endelle met them at her landing platform, hands planted on her leopard covered hips. \u201cWhat the fuck is all this nonsense about Third Earth, the darkening, and Duncan? What the hell is going on here?\u201d To Vela\u2019s surprise, Samuel took her hand as she walked beside him down the ramp. She glanced at him and he turned and sent, Is this okay?</p><p>She nodded. Absolutely. It\u2019s a comfort because I\u2019m way out of my depth.</p> <p>He gave her hand a squeeze.</p><p>She could get used to this. She\u2019d forgotten the simple pleasures of a man\u2019s company, of holding his much bigger, stronger hand.</p><p>Thorne had strengthened the security at the palace over the past couple of years, in part because not so long ago, Greaves had actually attacked the palace during Alison\u2019s rite of ascension. Thorne had also established his Command Center here, prior to the battle over White Lake, which had happened just a month ago.</p><p>Based on all the P.O.\u2019s she\u2019d processed for Thorne recently, Endelle\u2019s home would be the Command Center for the Allied Ascender Forces indefinitely.</p><p>As she followed behind Endelle, she passed through the smaller rotunda to a much larger one. The palace was essentially a series of rotundas that hung off the side of the McDowell Mountains overlooking a vast desert to the west.</p> <p>Entering one of the massive dome- like rooms, she had expected to see groupings of couches and tables. Instead, the room displayed a dozen large screens and more computers than she\u2019d ever seen in one room except at Militia HQ. The lights were kept low and specific to each desk. The open air balconies at either end were now partially closed off with enormous rolling screens.</p><p>Thorne stood next to Colonel Seriffe, who must have just folded in from North Africa. Together they scrolled through an iPad.</p><p>\u201cThorne,\u201d Endelle called out. \u201cI want you and Seriffe in on this. Now.\u201d Thorne met her gaze and Endelle paused in her steps. They seemed to be communicating telepathically.</p><p>Endelle finally shot a hand in the direction of an archway at the north end of the rotunda and called out, \u201cNow.\u201d Thorne glanced at Seriffe and nodded, then the two of them followed Her Supremeness. Seriffe moved quickly as did Thorne. Vela picked up her pace, matching Samuel\u2019s shift in stride. She glanced around at all the techs and support staff who seemed stunned by what had just happened. Apparently, even Endelle didn\u2019t order Thorne around much these days.</p><p>After crossing through two smaller rotundas, and passing through an arched entrance, she arrived at Endelle\u2019s sitting room, a large space with a white shag rug, glass tables, and purple couches and chairs.</p><p>Once inside, Endelle waved Vela and Samuel to the couch. She sat down and Samuel didn\u2019t hesitate to plant himself right next to her and to take hold of her hand again.</p> <p>\u201cGive us the details.\u201d Vela relayed in detail her journey through the intricate maze of darkening tunnels, of crossing the dimensional boundary, of the images that whisked by her as she moved, the explosions and of course everything that related to Duncan.</p><p>When she was done, Thorne, Seriffe, and Endelle stared at her, unspeaking.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re shitting me,\u201d Endelle finally said. She then dropped into the large purple chair that faced into the room. Her shoulders slumped.</p><p>Endelle\u2019s sudden despair stunned Vela and without thinking, she slipped into the woman\u2019s mind. Endelle\u2019s thoughts streamed quickly. Where the hell is Braulio? He\u2019s been gone this month, with not one goddamn word, and now we have a Third Earth intrusion. And the hell if I know what to do. We\u2019re losing Militia Warriors by the hundreds every night because of those three fucking generals and now this? An untried blondie, with darkening powers that exceeds even\u2014 She broke off and whipped her gaze to Vela. \u201cYou were in my head?\u201d she shouted.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t think. I was just suddenly there. And I didn\u2019t know.\u201d Vela eased back against the cushions. She felt as though she\u2019d been slapped, not by Endelle\u2019s outrage but by the truths she\u2019d just expressed, one after the other.</p><p>Hundreds of Militia Warriors.</p><p>Dying every night.</p><p>She released Samuel\u2019s hand and covered her face with her hands. She\u2019d avoided hearing news of the war. And all around the world, Militia Warriors, caught in the extended war, were dying.</p> <p>Hey, what\u2019s wrong? Samuel sent.</p><p>But before she could respond, Endelle had levitated to stand on the glass table in front of Vela. She looked up and stared at the outraged Amazon. \u201cYou stay the fuck out of my head, ascender, do you hear me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy apologies. Again.\u201d Vela had never been around Endelle very much and Havily had warned her, but the angle wasn\u2019t helping because Vela could see the lower rounded portions of her Supremeness\u2019s large bare breasts.</p><p>Yet somehow that helped, the absurdity of how Endelle dressed.</p><p>Endelle grunted, levitating back to the white shag carpet.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve joined the ranks, Madame Endelle, and I\u2019ll do what I can to help. But I don\u2019t know what to do. I can get Samuel to Duncan, but there\u2019s a limitation. We can\u2019t exit through the darkening at that point, as you know, in order to pull him out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck. You\u2019re right.\u201d She glanced at Thorne and Seriffe. To the latter, she said, \u201cDid you know Samuel has some kind of Third-based power?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I didn\u2019t.\u201d The leader of the Militia Warriors scowled as he set his strong gaze on Samuel. \u201cYou\u2019ve been holding back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor only one reason. Part of the power I have can\u2019t be controlled, at least not yet. I killed several innocent men with it when I escaped.\u201d Jean-Pierre shared his experience working out with Samuel.</p><p>Thorne\u2019s lips twitched. \u201cYou\u2019re telling me a mere Militia Warrior kept knocking you on your ass, J.P.?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOui. And I would complain but I believe he must become a Warrior of the Blood soon, perhaps the first we have had since my own induction.\u201d Samuel spoke quickly. \u201cJust to be clear, I have no intention of leaving the Thunder God Warriors.\u201d Jean-Pierre laughed. \u201cWe have all heard that from Gideon for over a year. I suppose I am not surprised.\u201d Vela glanced around the group of powerful ascenders, wondering what she was even doing here. How upside down was her world that a former purchase- order-processor sat in Endelle\u2019s private suite?</p><p>\u201cOkay, assholes,\u201d Endelle said.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get back to work.\u201d She flipped some of the small, spiral shells which in turn exposed a nipple.</p><p>All the men looked elsewhere.</p><p>Endelle rolled her eyes but addressed Vela. \u201cTake Samuel back to Duncan and see what happens. None of us have this kind of experience with the darkening. In fact, I want to be part of this.</p><p>So, let\u2019s do this from my office. You can head on over now. I\u2019ll be with you in a couple of minutes.\u201d Vela rose from the couch but before she even reached the door Samuel had hold of her hand. Once past the doorway, he switched sides so that by the time they\u2019d returned to the large rotunda that housed the command center, he formed a barrier between her and the men who worked there.</p><p>What\u2019s that about? She asked.</p><p>Those men were gawking at you.</p><p>No they weren\u2019t. She\u2019d noticed a couple of surreptitious looks but nothing close to staring at her with mouths wide open.</p><p>You don\u2019t want to argue with me about something like this, not right now.</p><p>You can yell at me later, if you want. But this damn breh-hedden is like fire on my skin. I\u2019m caught between wanting to punch every man who even looks at you to getting you somewhere private and tearing your clothes off. Shit, I shouldn\u2019t have said that.</p><p>As Vela walked, heading back to the platform, she didn\u2019t at first recognize the sensation that moved through her, like little streaks of lightning. His rich scent had thickened the air near her so that desire once more, always ready to take her over, stroked her breasts and the sweet spot between her legs. I don\u2019t mind, she sent in return. And she didn\u2019t. In fact, should they survive this next trip into the darkening, she might even suggest they do a little mutual exploration and see what happened, maybe even tap into a vein or two.</p><p>Her mouth watered suddenly. She hadn\u2019t shared blood in a long time and the thought of bringing Samuel into her body in that way, maybe while they were doing other things, caused her to shiver.</p><p>As she walked up the ramp, he sent, You have the most wonderful floral scent, which you are shedding in waves right now, and you\u2019ve got me worked up.</p><p>Standing beside him on the platform, she turned and met his gaze. Good, she sent. A split-second later, she folded beside him, flying through nether-space, but not before she saw his mouth drop.</p><p>Samuel arrived on the landing platform at Administrative HQ in a state of pain, and a level of gratitude for snug briefs and a battle kilt, he\u2019d never quite appreciated before.</p><p>Vela\u2019s eyes held a promise, one he understood really well because he knew that signal. Only this time, the breh- hedden had him in its cross-hairs and he was a target ready to hit. Her scent rose in clouds around her.</p><p>He slid his arm tight around her waist and walked her down the administrative HQ ramp, newly installed on the bottom floor of the building.</p><p>Once inside the elevator, he drew her into his arms and kissed her, plundering her mouth like he\u2019d never known a woman\u2019s mouth before. That she glided her hips back and forth so that her abdomen stroked his erection told him all that he needed to know about what she wanted from him.</p><p>He slung an arm around her neck, put a hand on her face and forced her to look at him. But he didn\u2019t say anything, he just met those large blue eyes and willed her to know him, to know what she was getting into. Her lips parted, her breath quickened.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not who you think I am. The man I could have been disappeared during those years I was gone. Do you understand?\u201d She nodded. \u201cI think I feel the same way. I\u2019ve been lost since my husband died. I haven\u2019t been the same, either.\u201d He nodded, then kissed her again, backing her into a corner, pressing his body up against hers. Time lost its meaning as he arched his hips into hers, pumping like he would once he got inside her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The doors opened, maybe for the tenth time, he wasn\u2019t sure, but a woman\u2019s voice, a blunt, crude voice, called into the elevator. \u201cSomebody get me a goddamn hose.\u201d Endelle had arrived already? Shit, how long had he kept Vela inside?</p><p>Samuel pulled away. If he\u2019d been in pain before, right now he felt like someone held his balls in a vise. He was so close to release that his abdomen spasmed.</p><p>Vela clung to the upper sides of his weapons harness, breathing hard.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re wasting precious time,\u201d Endelle said. \u201cYou know that, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep your panties on,\u201d Samuel snapped. \u201cWe\u2019re coming.\u201d Jesus, was he really talking to the Supreme High Administrator like that? The ruler of Second Earth?</p><p>He turned around to apologize, but Endelle only laughed. \u201cCome on, warrior.</p><p>Let\u2019s get this next job done. With what you went through in Honduras Two, the least you deserve is a beautiful blond getting your rocks off.\u201d She waved an arm toward the ceiling of the elevator. \u201cAnd just so you know, security has been enjoying the show.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, shit.\u201d He glanced up at the camera and knew a bunch of ascenders were smiling back at him. He didn\u2019t care about himself so much, but it bothered him that Vela was exposed like this. So, he glared at the red blinking light and said, \u201cIf I find one hint that you\u2019ve been spreading this around Second Earth, I\u2019ll hunt the last of you down and beat you as close to death as I can get, are we clear?\u201d A voice came over the speaker.</p> <p>\u201cErasing the CD now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we have an understanding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Warrior Samuel.\u201d Damn, they even knew his name.</p><p>He put his arm around Vela\u2019s shoulder and led her into the hall in the direction of Endelle\u2019s office.</p><p>Once inside, he took in the zebra skin rugs, the antique tusks that supported the unpolished marble desk, a fireplace to the left that looked as though it was never used and the full wall of windows that offered a magnificent view of miles and miles of the eastern desert. He loved this land, the dry air, the forever blue skies, the prickly nature of the inhabitants, human and otherwise. Desert living wasn\u2019t for the weak.</p><p>He glanced at Vela. Neither was taking on a vast power like Third Earth darkening abilities capable of moving through dimensions. His woman, yes his woman, stood facing Endelle\u2019s desk, her shoulders squared and ready.</p> <p>He understood something about Vela right then, that she would go the distance.</p><p>He knew many Militia Warriors like this, good men and women who he would trust with his life. Most of them would go on to become Section Leaders and they always set the best example for the troops.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you suggest, Madame Endelle?\u201d But the leader of Second Earth just shrugged. \u201cBeats the hell out of me. I don\u2019t do the darkening the way you described.</p><p>You\u2019ve got Third Earth chops. I don\u2019t.</p><p>This is your show, Vela. Though the one thing I can tell you is to go with your gut.</p><p>The rest will follow.\u201d Vela turned toward Samuel. \u201cI have no idea what we\u2019re going to find, but I think you should have your sword with you.\u201d Samuel glanced at Endelle, lifting his brows. \u201cCan I do that here? Fold my sword to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo it. We don\u2019t have the same security restrictions as either Apache Junction Two HQ or the palace. Thorne\u2019s been after me about it, but for now he can just bite me.\u201d Samuel withheld a smile. Thorne was revered among the Militia Warriors, a man\u2019s man, and destined apparently to replace Endelle. So to hear her say something like that about Thorne, perhaps more than anything else that had happened, made him know his life really had changed.</p><p>He thought the thought and folded his identified sword into his right hand, the blade held away from Vela. He moved to position himself on her right side.</p> <p>\u201cYou ready to go for a ride, warrior?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He knew what she meant, but their recent engagement in the elevator made him think of other things. He repressed his thoughts if not the squeeze he gave her waist or the smile that moved his lips inappropriately.</p><p>But her lips quirked as well, which made him wonder if the breh-hedden might have chosen wisely for him after all.</p><p>She shifted her gaze away from him.</p><p>He watched her concentrate on what couldn\u2019t be seen, probably searching for Duncan.</p><p>He tightened his hold on her waist and suddenly they were moving fast through the dark tunnel matrix she\u2019d described, flying down one tunnel, reaching a branch, choosing with deliberate ease the next tunnel, then flying some more.</p><p>He saw the same things she\u2019d described earlier as images raced past him. Once he\u2019d become accustomed to the movement, he tried to see what made up the images that flashed by.</p><p>Eventually he saw landscapes and cities, a lot of smoke, ruins, people in rags, some warriors in flight battle gear, people running and large whirlwinds of light which turned out to be weapons of heavy capacity and destruction. He watched people being blown to bits, heard others scream, saw warriors flying and bearing swords. Then more landscape, a beautiful peaceful earth, then even greater turmoil.</p><p>His heart sank as Vela continued to move him through the darkening. Third Earth, too, was a world at war and somehow, one of the culprits had gotten hold of Duncan, but to what purpose? And why execute him?</p><p>Vela began to slow and his sword hummed in his hand.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d He looked around carefully.</p><p>\u201cDo you hear that sound?\u201d He listened hard. And there it was.</p><p>\u201cLike a very distant explosion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. The last time, I barely made it out alive. They\u2019re coming for us and they\u2019re coming from the direction of Duncan\u2019s tunnel. I think they must know we\u2019re here.\u201d When another explosion sounded, closer still, that was all Samuel needed to know. \u201cGet us out of here, Vela. There\u2019s no point in moving forward if they\u2019ve got a fix on us and it seems they do.\u201d He turned her in a one-eighty, keeping his sword well away from her.</p><p>Then her voice was in his head. Samuel, the return route has changed, but I don\u2019t know why. I don\u2019t know if we\u2019re being directed that way, and it\u2019s an ambush, or what?</p><p>Remember what Endelle said, go with your gut.</p><p>Then I have to change course.</p><p>Do it. I\u2019ve been a warrior a long time. Going with your instincts will get you where you need to go, every damn time. You\u2019re connected to this power, so follow its lead.</p><p>But even as he said this to her, mind- to-mind, an explosion sounded behind them, much closer this time.</p><p>She flowed faster than before, taking tunnel after tunnel. He could feel the dimensional crossing, like a bump in the road, but still they were pursued as another explosion sounded.</p><p>Closer.</p><p>She reached the end of a tunnel. A dead end. I don\u2019t know what to do?</p><p>What do you see? All he saw was darkness, like a wall of infinite black.</p><p>I doorway with a kind of gold seal around it.</p><p>Another explosion. Try knocking.</p><p>An explosion sounded so close his ears rang.</p><p>Fuck that. Samuel, use your sword.</p><p>He didn\u2019t pause to ask questions. He summoned his dark power and as his smoky mist swirled around him, he sliced at the wall with his blade and what do you know, an opening peeled back.</p><p>A man in long black terry robe, a cigarette in one hand and martini glass in the other, stared back at him and muttered.</p><p>\u201cOh, shit!\u201d Samuel stepped through the opening, dragging Vela with him, turned and faced the breach but he saw nothing just the wall.</p><p>But he heard another explosion.</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d Their host said. \u201cThe wreckers followed you.\u201d Samuel turned back to face the robed stranger. \u201cWhat do we do?\u201d He rolled his eyes, settled his cigarette carefully on an ashtray, placed his martini glass on the coffee table then went to the wall.</p><p>Samuel pulled Vela close as another not-so-distant explosion rocked the space.</p><p>\u201cI could use some help here,\u201d the stranger called out.</p><p>Vela went to the wall, and placed her hands on it alongside the man.</p><p>\u201cShit, this isn\u2019t working,\u201d the man shouted.</p><p>Samuel\u2019s instincts kicked in and he went to the stranger. He placed his hand on the man\u2019s back and his own power flowed. A kind of zing went through him, into the stranger, and the power amplified about a hundred fold.</p><p>Then everything went black.</p><p>Sometime later he woke up on his back.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s awake now,\u201d Vela said.</p><p>He shifted his head slightly. Vela had hold of his hand, her knees curled next to him. Her long, unruly hair, full of waves and curls, hung beside her face, an almost angelic look. He squeezed her hand.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He glanced around. He was on the floor, in the same room, the stranger\u2019s living room. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou amplified Merl\u2019s power and he sealed the tunnel back up. Looks like we opened up an exit point that had been closed for about five decades.\u201d He glanced at her other hand. She held a martini glass. \u201cYou\u2019re drinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeemed like a good idea.</p><p>Greygoose dirty. Very nice. And we were very lucky Merl was here.\u201d She\u2019d called him by name twice.</p><p>He didn\u2019t like that. At all.</p><p>He sat up, his head spinning. Shit, where was his identified sword. Only he could touch the grip or the hilt. Jesus.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s my sword?\u201d Merl said. \u201cIt\u2019s humming over there.\u201d He gestured behind him.</p><p>Samuel widened his eyes. His sword was stuck about ten inches into the wall, on the opposite side of the large room, at least thirty feet away from where he now sat. There were many issues to address right now like how much he didn\u2019t like his new host since he could sense his male- hunting stench, but he needed to take care of his weapon first.</p><p>As he rose to his feet, he said, \u201cI take it we\u2019ve reached some kind of safe haven here on Second and you must be from Third.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuilty.\u201d Had Merl actually said that?</p><p>Samuel crossed in front of him, catching his gaze and holding it hard, as he passed by.</p><p>The man held up both hands in surrender, a new cigarette in one hand and a half full martini in the other. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Samuel pulled his sword from the wall, the familiar feel of the grip a comfort in what had become an increasingly bizarre situation. \u201cWe\u2019re on Second?\u201d Merl nodded and took a slow drag on his cigarette, squinting, savoring. \u201cYeah, you can fold it anywhere you want. I don\u2019t have shields up. Haven\u2019t needed them. Of course your arrival, as well as Vela\u2019s,\u201d he offered her a smile as he sipped his martini, then finished his thought.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, your arrival will force me to rethink my strategy.\u201d He\u2019d called Vela by name and smiled at her.</p><p>Good ol\u2019 Merl was starting to piss him off.</p> <p>Samuel thought-the-thought and got rid of his sword. He returned to Vela, and as he passed by Merl again, he made eye- contact and let him feel just what he thought about this Third ascender, with a power similar to his own.</p><p>Merl\u2019s lips quirked as he once more raised his martini glass and his cigarette in surrender. What a prick.</p><p>When Samuel reached Vela, she sent, What\u2019s the matter? You\u2019re all pissy and from what I can tell, Merl just saved our lives.</p><p>I had something to do with that.</p><p>Her expression softened. Yeah, you did and it cost you.</p> <p>\u201cOkay, you two. Enough with the telepathic chit-chat. It\u2019s kinda rude.\u201d The last word came out with a stretched \u2018u\u2019 sound. This man was one piece-of-work.</p><p>The weird thing was, Merl was warrior-sized and matched Samuel pound- for-pound. He wore black silk bottoms, but the terry robe, open to the waist, exposed muscled pecs.</p><p>Samuel slipped his arm around Vela.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d he asked, not trusting much about this stranger.</p><p>\u201cMerl Tuttle, escapee from Third Earth, former warrior, including stretches inside the darkening grid. Got sick of the chaos on Third and found a way to get out.</p><p>Question is, how did you find me? I haven\u2019t had visitors from Third since I got here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re not from Third,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhy, Vela, you didn\u2019t tell me that.\u201d He\u2019d caressed her name. Hell, he\u2019d poured oil over every single one of those words, the bastard, and now a lovely red hue covered Samuel\u2019s vision as his dark power rose in a sudden smoky stream.</p><p>He launched at Merl before he had time to think or before he could respond to Vela calling out, \u201cDon\u2019t, Samuel. He\u2019s a friend!\u201d He caught bare arms, because somewhere in Samuel flying at Merl, the Third ascender had lost his robe and dropped into a fighting stance.</p><p>Samuel grappled with him, wrestling him to the ground, then letting his fists fly.</p><p>Merl folded out of his hold, levitated.</p><p>Samuel\u2019s dark power recognized his foe and responded with similar levitation and folding, until once more he made contact.</p><p>But Merl had more power and the next thing Samuel knew, he lay face down on the carpet, a knee in his back, and one arm pulled back and upright to the breaking point.</p><p>\u201cYou done throwing a fit?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t talk to my woman that way.\u201d The words sounded slurred since they were half-spoken into a thick carpet.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Merl let him go. Samuel rose to his feet, breathing hard, sweating, mad. He glared at Merl. \u201cJust leave Vela alone.</p><p>She\u2019s mine.\u201d Merl opened his mouth to speak then closed it. \u201cHold the phone. Are we talking that breh-hedden shit here? I mean I heard rumors that Thorne had been laid waste.</p><p>It\u2019s the breh-hedden, isn\u2019t it?\u201d But Samuel stepped into him and got about an inch away from his nose \u201cBreh- hedden or not, stay the fuck away from my woman. We clear?\u201d Merl narrowed his eyes and though he said nothing, he stared back, nostrils flaring.</p><p>But suddenly the air above them was full of light, then little pin-pricks of fiery pain hit his bare shoulders, arms and back.</p><p>He waved his hands, as Merl did, batting away the annoying bites of fire.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is that? Another trick Merl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you two Neanderthals finished?\u201d The sound of Vela\u2019s voice, as well as the cessation of sparks falling all around him, caused Samuel to turn and stare at her. \u201cWhat was that?\u201d She turned a palm up and a small firework appeared, which she then launched toward the ceiling. When it floated down, it winked out in a succession of small bursts of flames.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you do that?\u201d Samuel asked.</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re both being ridiculous, especially you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, me?\u201d He jerked his thumb toward Merl.</p><p>\u201cThis asshole was disrespecting you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you were treating him like a moron. Knock it off.\u201d Her criticism rankled.</p><p>Merl pulled at the sides of his bottoms. \u201cI have little holes in my pjs.\u201d Vela rolled her eyes but walked toward the entry wall. \u201cSorry, Merl, but I don\u2019t give a rat\u2019s ass about your pajamas.\u201d She planted a hand on the wall, her blond hair falling almost to her waist.</p><p>He decided he loved her hair. \u201cI need to know about this. What it is, how we got through, and what those explosions were.</p><p>You said something earlier about wreckers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Merl,\u201d Samuel said, without affection, \u201cTell us about the wreckers.\u201d Merl held out his hand and a lit cigarette appeared between his fingers.</p><p>He took a puff, once more squinting slightly, glaring. The bastard.</p><p>After he\u2019d released a puff of smoke in Samuel\u2019s direction, he said, \u201cLook, I don\u2019t know who either of you are, but clearly you\u2019ve got a lot of power between you. Which one of you saw the gate?\u201d Vela turned slightly toward the wall.</p><p>\u201cI did. We\u2019d reached the end of the tunnel and I saw a glowing archway here, in this location. Samuel couldn\u2019t see it, but he used his sword to break through.\u201d He narrowed his eyes at Samuel.</p><p>\u201cOnly a powerful warrior can use his sword to make a breach in a gate.\u201d Then back to Vela. \u201cBut it\u2019s the rare ascender who can locate gates like mine.\u201d Vela turned toward him. \u201cSo then you had enough power to find this gate in the first place?\u201d Merl took another drag, another sip.</p><p>He glanced at her. \u201cHell, no. I paid a fortune, a life\u2019s fortune, to have the gate made then erased from all the grid documents.\u201d His eyes grew cloudy.</p><p>Samuel tried to figure out what would have caused a vampire like Merl to have given up his fortune, his occupation, the life he\u2019d built on Third Earth, to come here and live, literally, off the grid. He wanted to think the worst of Merl, that he was some kind of psychotic outlaw, but he sensed that Merl possessed a warrior\u2019s honorable core, despite his interest in Vela.</p><p>Merl sat down in a low-chair angled from the corner of the room. \u201cAll right you two, have a seat and I\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s going on, or what I think is going on.\u201d He sighed heavily. \u201cWell, it was a nice five- decade run. Fuck.\u201d Vela crossed to the couch opposite the entry wall. She sat down, shoving the left mass of her hair over her right shoulder. Somewhere along the way, she\u2019d set her martini glass down.</p><p>Samuel remained where he was. \u201cI\u2019ll stand.\u201d He reached down near Merl\u2019s chair, picked up the terry robe and threw it at Merl\u2019s bare, muscled chest.</p><p>Merl laughed, waved the hand with the cigarette, and the terry was once more wrapped around him. But he smirked.</p><p>\u201cProbably a good idea you don\u2019t sit down,\u201d Merl said. \u201cYou\u2019d mess up my furniture, with that black smoke that leaks out of you. It\u2019s called grayle, by the way.\u201d He even spelled it. \u201cAnd rare on Third.</p><p>Not the grayle, just the color of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose gifted with this kind of power, like me, can release just about any shade of grayle from light gray to white.</p><p>But not that charcoal shit. You\u2019ve got tremendous latent power because of it.\u201d Recalling the way his power had streamed and killed those men, Samuel had to agree. He quickly repressed the guilt that was always about an inch away.</p><p>Merl glanced between the two of them and frowned. He didn\u2019t speak right away, but the line of his lips tightened.</p><p>Finally, he said, \u201cAll right, I want to hear this from the beginning then I\u2019ll answer your questions. How the hell did you end up in the darkening grid that connects Second and Third Earth?\u201d</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>Vela reeled from the recent scrapping match between the men. She\u2019d never seen anything like it, or at least not to this degree. She\u2019d witnessed similar antics when her husband and other Militia Warriors would gather in a knot around the BBQ and do some proverbial chest- thumping.</p><p>In this case, however, Samuel had looked ready to tear Merl apart.</p><p>Fortunately, the Third ascender out- powered Samuel with his own Third ability, otherwise the men would probably have battled for hours.</p><p>She\u2019d therefore done the only thing she could think of, which had actually worked, when she\u2019d rained a series of about twenty fireworks down from the ceiling until each stopped his caveman posturing.</p><p>Of course, it would have helped more if she\u2019d actually disliked that Samuel had gone caveman on her. At the very least, the breh-hedden had a strong sexual component and watching the warrior exhibit all that possessive behavior had worked her libido like throwing a match on a gasoline-soaked campfire.</p><p>Poof, instant blaze.</p><p>She knew what had been going on and that Merl had been putting out his own feelers, though she thought his intentions ranged on the side of riling Samuel up.</p><p>The discussion had turned, just as it should, to their current predicament, and since her power had led her here, straight to Merl, who lived in some kind of reclusive state on Second, she told him all that she knew, including what she\u2019d seen of Duncan\u2019s horrific imprisonment.</p><p>Merl had started out intrigued by what had brought them into his house, but by the end of her narrative, he\u2019d slumped in his chair, took the last drag of his cigarette before folding it away, then released a heavy sigh.</p><p>\u201cWell, fuck,\u201d he said succinctly.</p><p>Samuel crossed his arms over his chest. \u201cNot helping. But damn if I don\u2019t think you know exactly what\u2019s going on.\u201d Merl slid his gaze in Samuel\u2019s direction and the men exchanged a long look until Merl finally dipped his chin. \u201cIn part. But I\u2019ll begin here. The fact that the two of you were able to engage the darkening grid, and travel between dimensions, tells me that certain warring factions of Third Earth have begun an infiltration of this dimension. Someone\u2019s on the prowl, looking to utilize whatever power Second has to offer, maybe even to take over, who the hell knows.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut what does that have to do with us? Why Vela and me?\u201d Merl shrugged.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always believed that forces are constantly at work to sustain balance in our dimensional world, and I don\u2019t mean Upper Dimension forces, but something outside our comprehension. Call it the Creator or the Universe, whatever.\u201d Samuel snorted. \u201cYou\u2019re talking metaphysical bullshit.\u201d Merl met his gaze. \u201cIf that idea doesn\u2019t appeal, think of it as genetic intervention, that certain ascenders have genetic markers that get ticked when elements or stressors arise, like war. Then powers emerge, like yours and Vela\u2019s, to counter other darker, more chaotic energies.\u201d Vela twined a thick lock of her hair around her finger and turned toward Samuel. He\u2019d said that his power had taken hold while he\u2019d been bound by ropes and tortured. And hers had emerged at a time when three rogue generals were about to plunge Second Earth into a new round of war and misery. Maybe Merl was onto something.</p><p>She released the lock of hair. \u201cWell, setting philosophy aside, tell us about Third Earth, what\u2019s going on up there?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNasty war. Much worse than Second. You don\u2019t want to get drawn into their conflict but it looks like you just might. The trouble with Third is that there are several factions vying for supremacy right now, not just one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s at the heart of the war?\u201d Samuel asked. \u201cTerritorial disputes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVast disputes, going back millennia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there a Militia Warrior contingent involved?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, spread through the various factions, and each has an elite Warrior of the Blood force as well, which is why the war is so damn problematic; you\u2019ll find men of great worth, slaying other men of equal worth.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut haven\u2019t you just described every war that either vampire or humankind has ever waged?\u201d Vela asked.</p><p>At that, Merl shifted in her direction and drew in a deep breath. \u201cSamuel,\u201d he said, staring at Vela. \u201cYou have a woman of great perception here and of understanding.\u201d To Vela he added, \u201cI believe you\u2019ve spoken a truth, but perhaps only part of it. Not all warriors are honorable. But in the case of Third Earth, imagine Warrior Thorne battling someone just like him, in every respect. Now imagine being unable to get any faction to a negotiating table.\u201d Once more, he drew a cigarette into his hand, already lit, and dragged deep.</p><p>She read his story in this simple, habitual reaction to a reminder of no doubt what he\u2019d left behind in his world. Maybe where he\u2019d failed.</p><p>She frowned. \u201cMerl, were you kicked out of Third or did you leave on your own?\u201d He rolled the cigarette between his knuckles, staring at it. \u201cIf any of the factions find me, they\u2019ll kill me, which is why your busting through my wall at the end of a grid tunnel pisses the hell out of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you in danger, I mean right now?\u201d She leaned forward slightly.</p><p>\u201cMaybe. I don\u2019t know. Depends on the wrecking squad that traced you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo they work in squads,\u201d she stated.</p><p>\u201cYep. And any of the factions can send squads through the darkening grid in order to destroy what they perceive as the enemy. The weapons are sawed off shotguns, very inelegant, but effective, and besides blowing a trespassing ascender to hell, can break through the walls of the grid, which in turn allows for quicker movement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, they must use explosive shells,\u201d Samuel said.</p><p>Merl nodded. \u201c10 gauge. The wrecker\u2019s own power amplifies the shot.</p><p>You get a goddamn righteous explosion, enough to blow away your target and take down a grid wall, which ain\u2019t easy.</p><p>Wreckers are a highly specialized and extremely well-paid faction of any army. I worked as one for a couple of decades at the turn of the 20th century. There are limitations, however, but that shotgun makes up for most of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happens once a section of grid is destroyed? Does it get repaired?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep, with crews dedicated to clean- up and others to restoring grid walls. All Third Earth shit, developed centuries ago.</p> <p>You were just lucky that Greaves didn\u2019t catch wind of it but even Chustaffus knew not to encourage that beast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChustaffus?\u201d A chill shot through Vela, her instincts shouting at her that here was the real enemy.</p><p>\u201cThe reigning Prince of Darkness.</p><p>Sort of. He\u2019s never been able to solidify control. But then, I\u2019m not sure control is even what he wants. I used to think it was, but he has a perverted love of chaos. The more he can create, the happier he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we were being pursued deliberately.\u201d Samuel rocked on his heels.</p><p>The next smoke plume blew in Samuel\u2019s direction. \u201cDo you honestly think it was anything else? From what you\u2019ve told me, the wreckers already had wind of you and had put a trace on Vela\u2019s darkening aura. The moment she returned into the tunnel grid, the trace would have alerted the specific faction\u2019s crew that went after you both.</p><p>\u201cBut what I really want to know is how the two of you found me. You shouldn\u2019t have been able to.\u201d Samuel shifted in Vela\u2019s direction, his brow furrowed. \u201cVela has some kind of built-in guidance system that takes her through the grid. Wouldn\u2019t you say that\u2019s right?\u201d She nodded. \u201cExactly.\u201d Merl whistled. Glancing from one to the other, his gaze finally landed on Samuel. \u201cWell, though I\u2019m reluctant to give you any cred at all, you\u2019ve got some serious chops, and you\u2019ve the temper of a Warrior of the Blood, even a Third Warrior. But what I don\u2019t get is where the hell did this power come from? How did it develop? This is Third Earth warrior shit, yet you\u2019re still very much a Second ascender. So, exactly how long have you been releasing this badass mist?\u201d Vela sensed Samuel\u2019s thoughts shift, a kind of sliding into the dark experiences of his past. His molars moved against each other and his gaze slanted away from Merl. But he spoke of the torture, a few clipped sentences, ending with, \u201cWhen Duncan found me in Honduras, he basically helped me to escape. I\u2019d been experiencing a growth in power, but that day, it rose unexpectedly, streams of it that I couldn\u2019t control, and I slaughtered those around me, all except Duncan who\u2019d heard me shout at him to get the hell out of there. I didn\u2019t even have a warning it was coming.\u201d Merl scowled. \u201cGrayle power can be like that, especially when it first arrives. Most warriors have signs of it long before the initial release and a mentor helps control the process. The problem is, no two grayle powers are exactly alike and sometimes bad things happen, like what happened to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan those streams be controlled?\u201d Samuel held his breath.</p><p>\u201cYou have to learn how to access them first.\u201d Samuel shook his head. \u201cI have no idea how to do that and believe me I\u2019ve tried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe patient. It\u2019ll come. But can I ask you if you ever saw your torturer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, though I never heard his name spoken. He was a tall motherfucker, built warrior big, finely trimmed goatee, long, thick black hair, black eyes. He wore three braids on each side of his head, the whole mass clipped back. Sound like someone you know?\u201d Merl stubbed out his cigarette in the ashtray at his elbow. Sometimes he used the ashtrays and at other times, he\u2019d fold the lit cigarettes away. He dropped his head in his hands. \u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Vela said, \u201cWho the hell is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSharav.</p><p>One of Chustaffus\u2019s minions. Well at least now I can frame this, make sense of it. You were essentially in the hands of a madman.\u201d Samuel snorted. \u201cHell, I could have told you that. He spent a lot of time hurting my wing-locks.\u201d Vela shuddered.</p><p>But Merl\u2019s chin dipped a couple of times as he looked up at Samuel. \u201cThe grayle comes from the locks. Your boy was experimenting on you, trying to create what apparently he succeeded in creating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA freak?\u201d Merl shook his head. \u201cSharav made a Third Earth Warrior from basic Second material. But it looks like his plan must have backfired.\u201d The pronouncement set a vibration in Vela\u2019s bones as her gaze drifted to Samuel. Her instincts boiled, running at her with critical information, that his status as a Third Warrior had great significance in her world and that her darkening power, fully able to engage in Third Earth, meshed with his.</p><p>\u201cAnd when did Sharav capture you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEleven years ago and I spent a decade in that hellhole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen they\u2019ve been here awhile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d Vela asked.</p><p>Merl met her gaze. \u201cThe only access through normal folding has to occur through the Gateway to Third Earth, the one that Warrior Leto now guards. Which means, that one or more of the factions has found a way, through the darkening, to move back and forth between dimensions with no one the wiser.\u201d Vela shifted in her seat. \u201cAre you able to travel through the darkening?\u201d Merl once more shook his head.</p><p>\u201cWhen I lived on Third, I could, but not from this entrance point and believe me, I\u2019ve tried. Once I set up this gate, I couldn\u2019t go back.\u201d Vela glanced around his living room.</p><p>The house looked settled, like it had been inhabited for a long time. The bookshelves opposite had papers stacked on them. A flat screen TV sat on a table by the wall to her left with three ashtrays lined up in front of it. The furniture resembled Danish modern from fifty-years-ago with a lot of light colored wood and simple lines. \u201cSo, who are you in this world, on Second Earth I mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m part of a small group of outcast Third Earth ascenders. I\u2019m going to have to meet up with them in about a half-hour and talk over this turn of events. In the meantime, you\u2019ll have to stay put. If you\u2019ve been tagged, as I think you\u2019ve been, spies here on Second will track your movements. Right now, you\u2019re invisible and you should stay that way until I can get you more info.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne question,\u201d Samuel asked. \u201cIf Sharav has been moving around on Second Earth, why hasn\u2019t he come for me?\u201d Merl\u2019s lips curved slowly. \u201cCould be a dozen reasons but my guess is that he\u2019s afraid of you on some level, maybe of that part of your power that he can\u2019t control. Doesn\u2019t mean he won\u2019t kill you if he gets the chance. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd you have to remember, he won\u2019t want his presence on Second known. Any overt operation could blow his cover, which works in your favor.</p><p>Trust me.\u201d Vela frowned. \u201cBut won\u2019t they come back here, to your gate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnlikely. Your ability to see the gate is extremely rare and this part of the grid continues on like I don\u2019t even exist.</p> <p>The best the darkening grid operators can do is look for anomalies and investigate.</p><p>But the grid is so vast, some speculate it\u2019s infinite.\u201d He frowned before adding, \u201cNow, who\u2019s your mission contact, because I take it you discussed this with your superiors?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMadame Endelle.\u201d His eyes glinted. \u201cShe\u2019s one tough hombre.\u201d His gaze slid away, staring at nothing in particular. \u201cGod, I loved that whole Mardis Gras thing. If I was just a little older and had more essential power \u2014\u201d He broke off, giving himself a shake.</p><p>\u201cYou should contact her and tell her that we\u2019re here, we exist, and we apologize for not letting her know. She won\u2019t like it, but we agreed early on that the only way we\u2019d survive is to remain incognito.</p><p>\u201cIn the meantime, the kitchen is that way, as well as a guest suite that I\u2019m turning over to you for the duration until this shitty mess gets sorted. My rooms are on the opposite side of the house. Just sayin\u2019.\u201d He jerked his head behind him.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you talk to Endelle, block the communication then let her know that you\u2019ll get back to her by midnight and yes I realize that\u2019s six hours from now. But I promise that I\u2019ll do what I can to help you get Warrior Duncan out of that cell before his time\u2019s up. How does that sound? We good?\u201d He rose from his chair and stubbed out his cigarette.</p><p>As Vela pressed her thoughts against Samuel\u2019s mind, he turned abruptly in her direction. What do you think? Do you trust our host?</p><p>After a moment, he smiled, if ruefully. Yeah, I do, the bastard. To Merl, he said. \u201cIt\u2019ll work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow grab a bite to eat, you two.</p><p>You have a long night ahead of you on every possible front. Understood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it,\u201d Samuel said.</p> <p>Vela rose as well.</p><p>By now, Merl\u2019s smirk, and all his ridiculous flirting, had disappeared. \u201cI\u2019m heading to my rooms then I\u2019ll be gone within the next fifteen-minutes or so.\u201d He glanced at Samuel. \u201cYou\u2019ll have the place to yourselves.\u201d But the smirk made a reappearance just as he lifted his arm and vanished.</p><p>Vela\u2019s mind took a couple of quick spins then landed on the one fact that put butterflies in her stomach: six hours alone with Samuel.</p><p>And the breh-hedden.</p><p>Of course, this reality completely overwhelmed her so she turned on her heel and headed for the kitchen as she called out, \u201cI\u2019ll see if I can find some stuff for sandwiches, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSandwiches sounds good.\u201d He wasn\u2019t far behind, his thoughts apparently matching her own since his bitter chocolate scent suffused the air. She barely withheld a groan.</p><p>As she rounded the island, topped with a polished slab of light colored granite, she caught sight of a large picture window beyond. Though it was dark outside, her vampire vision, always adjusting, saw the vista as in a dim glow.</p><p>Crossing to the window, she said, \u201cLook at this. Merl\u2019s house is perched on a mountainside.\u201d Pine trees framed the sides of the view, but the cliff dropped off to reveal an opposite forested ridge as well as a starry sky beyond.</p> <p>\u201cIncredible.\u201d Samuel drew up behind her, and settled his hands on her hips. \u201cWhy would he ever want to leave this place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t. He must love it here.\u201d His thumbs kneaded her waist through her silk blouse. Without thinking she leaned into him and he surrounded her with his arms. The battle harness was stiff but she didn\u2019t care. The sensation felt very familiar.</p><p>She\u2019d been without a man for so long and now Samuel was here, the man who had saved Santiago at the Superstitions, who had been with her in the darkening and helped her to escape, who had wrestled Merl because of his jealousy.</p><p>His chocolate scent wafted over her nose, drifted inside, and began filtering through her brain. She felt dizzy and her body warmed up all over again.</p><p>\u201cThat scent of yours,\u201d he whispered against her ear. \u201cThe sweetest flowers.\u201d He groaned softly then released her. \u201cI\u2019m going to shower, fold some fresh clothes over here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, right.\u201d She felt him leave, but didn\u2019t turn to look. She was afraid she\u2019d call him back and right now she wanted some space.</p><p>What was she doing? Another Militia Warrior?</p><p>Maybe she had emerging powers but did that really mean she should get all tangled up with a man whose job could hurt her again?</p><p>But knowing that he\u2019d headed to the guest suite didn\u2019t help. She put a hand to her stomach and worked at her breathing a little more as she tried not to picture Samuel out of his kilt and harness, stepping into the shower, that beautiful muscled body of his, the water flowing\u2014\u201d Six hours alone with Samuel.</p><p>A guest suite.</p><p>A bed.</p><p>She forced her thoughts elsewhere and fortunately, she recalled that for the last hour, she\u2019d essentially left Endelle hanging.</p><p>She thought about using her phone, but knew instinctively that would be a mistake. Her telepathy had considerable strength and given the circumstances, she thought what the hell.</p><p>She opened her mind to Endelle and just like that the woman was there. Where the hell have you been, ascender? I\u2019ve been pacing my damn office for over half- an-hour. Jesus H. Christ.</p><p>Endelle, you need to shield this communication. Can you do that?</p><p>Can I do that? What millennium do you think this is? Five thousand BC? Fuck you.</p><p>Okay. Not good to question the abilities of an already agitated scorpion queen.</p><p>Vela felt Endelle\u2019s shields lock into place and she released a deep sigh.</p><p>Okay, start talking, ascender.</p><p>I\u2019m sorry, Madame Endelle, but we\u2019re in deep shit, I mean trouble, over here.</p><p>\u2018Shit\u2019 works fine. So spill the beans.</p><p>What\u2019s going on, and don\u2019t hold anything back like I\u2019m a nut-sack that can\u2019t take pain, got it?</p><p>Understood. Vela explained their situation in detail, including everything she knew to-date about Merl.</p><p>Endelle was silent for a moment, then asked, So, what does this ascender look like? Did you get a look at his jewels? Is he hung? I might have to pay a call and check out the talent myself.</p><p>Vela leaned over, planting her elbows on the island, supporting her head with her hands. She chuckled. Havily had warned her about Endelle\u2019s lack of filters, but she\u2019d never experienced it like this before. Was Merl hung? Oh, dear, God.</p><p>As much as I\u2019d like to share my observations with you about Merl Tuttle, I have a little problem. Samuel is already jealous, as in breh-hedden out-of-his-mind jealous, and if he knew I\u2019d started describing this man in detail, I\u2019d have hell to pay. Besides, rumor has it that you\u2019ve got a boyfriend.</p><p>You mean that prick, Braulio? He shagged me four weeks ago and I haven\u2019t seen him since. Not one word. Like he dropped off the face of the fucking dimensional world. Again. Asshole. But why the hell am I telling you this?</p><p>Vela heard Endelle\u2019s concern, despite her invective, so she asked, Do you think he\u2019s in some kind of trouble?</p><p>He\u2019s a goddamn fucking Sixth ascender. The only kind of trouble he could get into is with his dick, so no, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s in trouble, unless of course he shows his face around here again, then I might just destroy all of Metro Phoenix Two making sure I roast his ass.</p><p>Note to self. Never mention Braulio again.</p><p>Okay, Vela sent. Got it. Anyway, Merl wants us to stick around. He has to talk to his fellow refugees to decide how to move forward.</p><p>Endelle fell silent and was so quiet that if Vela hadn\u2019t known better, she would swear she\u2019d ended the conversation. But Vela waited and finally Endelle said, Since you and Samuel trust him, and I have no way of knowing what he can do for you at this point, we\u2019d better ride this mule. Just keep me informed.</p><p>Vela would have said a polite \u2018yes, of course I will\u2019 or maybe offered a \u2018good-bye\u2019, but a sudden break, that sent a brisk shard of pain striking the center of her brain, told her the telepathic call was over.</p><p>She took a few more deep breaths until the pain faded then turned to her sandwich idea only to find the fridge empty except for an old dehydrated pizza in a grease-stained box. There was also a quart of milk, but she\u2019d rather shoot herself than do a sniff test.</p><p>She twisted her hair around her hand, looked at it, then folded a large clip into her hand. She secured the upper curly- wavy mass into the clip. The last thing she wanted was her ridiculous hair in her food.</p><p>Back to her task, she saw that plenty of beer lined the entire middle shelf, so she pulled out two bottles of Guinness, closed the door, then proceeded to fold food from her home fridge onto the counter; sour dough, sharp cheddar, ham, a ripe tomato, bell pepper and a stick of butter. She sliced the vegetables super thin, layered the meat, vegetables, and cheese on the bread, and with butter now sizzling in the large frying pan, started grilling three sets.</p><p>She smiled as she worked, sipping the brew between tasks. She remembered how much her husband liked these sandwiches, something she often fixed for him when he\u2019d return from a night\u2019s battling. Then he\u2019d make love to her. What a good man he\u2019d been, irritating at times as all men were, but he\u2019d loved her and told her often. A woman didn\u2019t need much more than that from her man, not really.</p><p>She put a finger gently beneath each eye and caught her tears, but she also realized that a year ago, she would have dropped to the floor sobbing all over again at what she\u2019d lost.</p><p>Maybe the fifth year had finally softened the pain.</p><p>Maybe.</p><p>When she heard singing coming from way down the hall, she laughed. Samuel so could not carry a tune.</p><p>By the time the cheese had melted and the crust was grilled to a perfect golden color, Samuel walked into the kitchen. \u201cYou don\u2019t know how good that smells. Oh, your hair looks nice like that. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Pulled back.\u201d She turned with two plates in her hands and looked him up and down. He wore jeans and an olive green t-shirt, snug across his muscled shoulders and chest.</p><p>He looked gorgeous, even down to his bare feet. She blinked a couple of times, then said, \u201cGuess which one is yours.\u201d She\u2019d cut all three sandwiches in half, placed a half on her plate, and stacked the rest on his.</p><p>He reached out his hands and relieved her of the heavier plate, planted his butt on the closest stool, and started to eat.</p> <p>His eyes kept rolling back in his head. \u201cYou\u2019re a genius.\u201d He repeated the compliment more than once.</p><p>Vela brought him his beer shaking her head. He looked like he hadn\u2019t eaten in years, which reminded her not just of what he\u2019d been through in the past decade but that he hadn\u2019t had a woman in his life in a long time. Unless a man liked to cook, his fridge usually looked like Merl\u2019s and take-out was the order of the day.</p><p>By the time he finished, he turned to her. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I wolfed that down. It was just so good. But my God you can cook.\u201d She started to laugh and couldn\u2019t seem to stop.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d Between chuckles, she somehow managed to say, \u201cI grilled you a couple of sandwiches. That\u2019s all.\u201d He smiled as well. \u201cWhat can I say. I usually order pizza.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought. Your pal, Merl, does the same.\u201d He glanced around at the plates.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you mean? There\u2019s bread and a couple of tomatoes\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no. This stuff I folded from my house.\u201d He met her gaze, one elbow on the counter, the kitchen lights soft on his features. \u201cThank you. I haven\u2019t had such a nice, home-cooked meal in a long time.\u201d She met his gaze, his smoky gray eyes, and in a slow wave, what had begun at the workout center moved through her, catching up her breath then letting it fall.</p><p>His pupils dilated and his lips parted. His scent, almost absent while he ate, now flooded the space between them.</p><p>She could feel his thoughts like a caress on her skin. Her gaze drifted to his throat and her earlier desire returned. She trembled.</p><p>\u201cHow long has it been since you\u2019ve taken the vein?\u201d his deep voice had grown deeper, a sound that reached inside her chest and squeezed the air from her lungs.</p><p>Five years. \u201cToo long.\u201d She felt paralyzed, though. She wanted to do this with him, but she was frightened of feeling too much for a man whose occupation terrified her.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have to do this,\u201d he said softly, but his entire body had tensed up.</p><p>Her gaze shifted to his face, his eyes, the tight line of his lips. He swiveled away from her, facing the counter. \u201cI understand if you don\u2019t want to do this. I get it.\u201d But his scent worked over every inch of her body so that something very low in her abdomen began to vibrate strangely, from front to back, a soft humming sensation she could almost hear. Need crawled through her, need for him, for sex, and for his blood. She put her hand at the small of her back and rubbed.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I feel achy right here.\u201d She rubbed the muscles near her tail bone.</p><p>He whipped toward her and planted his hand in the same location. \u201cLet me do that for you.\u201d She caught sight of the ridges along his forehead. He thought she was hurting.</p><p>Maybe more than even his beautiful scent, or how built he was, that small expression of concern did her in.</p><p>His hand low on her back, rubbing her, also had a sudden effect as her spine arched and her body bloomed like never before.</p><p>\u201cOh, that feels so good.\u201d She ached across her pelvis, deep into her well.</p> <p>He massaged her. \u201cIs that better?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter?\u201d She didn\u2019t understand the question. It felt wonderful. \u201cOh, my God.</p><p>What is that? Don\u2019t stop. I feel\u2014 Oh.\u201d And just like that, as though it had been building for hours, an intense orgasm ripped through her so that she called out a long, lusty cry, holding onto the counter for support as he kept pressing his hand rhythmically into her lower back.</p><p>When the sensation passed, she grew very still, staring up at the ceiling, her body flooded with the most beautiful sensation. That same vibration lingered, teasing her, so that she knew it would take very little to do that all over again.</p><p>\u201cYou can stop now,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>He drew his hand back frowning at her. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? What the hell just happened? Are you all right? Jesus, Vela.</p><p>Tell me you\u2019re all right.\u201d She remained seated for a long, long moment, trying to figure out exactly how to say to Samuel, who she\u2019d met only a few hours ago, that just by rubbing her back, he\u2019d brought her to an amazing climax.</p><p>She turned toward him and slipped off the stool to stand close to him, but all she could do was blink.</p><p>\u201cVela, what the hell is going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how to tell you this, but I just ... that is, you ... I mean\u2014\u201d She couldn\u2019t get the words out.</p><p>He thumbed her lips and slid his arm around her waist. \u201cI think I get it because your fragrance smells just a little different, deeper, richer. \u201cYou just came, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but I don\u2019t know how. This has never happened before, not like that.\u201d She drew back, but only far enough to take both his hands and start guiding him in the direction of the guest suite. \u201cCome with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVela, are you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what this is between us, but yeah, we\u2019re doing this. All I know is that I need you inside me and I want your blood and I want both now.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>Samuel\u2019s biceps flexed and his lower jaw trembled. His mouth flooded with saliva at the thought of taking Vela\u2019s blood. Would it taste like the soft floral fragrance that enveloped him, sweetened by her recent orgasm; woman and flowers and sex? He needed to know.</p><p>Whatever rational ability he possessed dropped deep into the ocean of all this sensation. He was hard for her and ready to do whatever she needed him to do and he could feel her need like fire against his skin.</p><p>He wanted his hands on her, his mouth, his cock pushing into her.</p><p>When he reached the bedroom, he shoved the door shut with his foot just in case Merl returned early.</p><p>\u201cYou ready for me, warrior?\u201d Her eyelids were low, her breathing ragged.</p><p>She reached up and released the clip, letting her mane of wild hair flow over her shoulders.</p><p>She touched her blouse, folding it away to reveal a sheer bra. Her nipples had formed hard beads and he wanted a taste.</p><p>He crossed to her, sliding one arm around her back, then dipping low to suck her left breast through the fabric. She moaned and shed her scent. He played with her damp wing-locks, running his fingers over several of them until she writhed against him as he sucked.</p><p>Her hands dipped into his hair, pulling it from the leather straps he used to tie them back. She dove her fingers into the mass and tugged at the back of his neck. Her breast flexed as he sucked.</p><p>\u201cSamuel, I\u2019m so close again. My God, what you do to me.\u201d He drew back and said, \u201cI want to try something with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything.\u201d He groaned. \u201cYou\u2019ll need to be completely undressed.\u201d She nodded and with a mere thought, removed the rest of her clothes. He grew very still as his gaze drifted down her body, resting on her full breasts, her navel, her bare lower lips.</p><p>For a moment, he couldn\u2019t think, couldn\u2019t remember what he\u2019d had in mind.</p><p>He nodded a couple of times, more to clear his head than anything else. Then he remembered and hissed softly.</p><p>\u201cNow lie back on the bed.\u201d She stretched out and with her body prone she became a banquet for him. He leaned over her, off to the side of her legs, because for what he had in mind he needed both his hands free. He started to rub her lower abdomen, back and forth with one hand. \u201cHow does this feel?\u201d Her lips parted. \u201cOh,\u201d came out in a long, soft moan, then, \u201cGood.\u201d He massaged lightly back and forth over her pelvis.</p><p>\u201cAre you feeling something similar, like at the island?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, like a vibration, a humming.\u201d He massaged deeper.</p><p>Her body arched. \u201cOh, that\u2019s heaven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does it feel like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike waves of pleasure, wherever your hand moves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPull your knees up.\u201d She obeyed and with his free hand he stroked the inside of her leg, pushing toward her groin. Her right thigh rested against his body. At the same time, he continued to rub her abdomen, watching her stomach muscles flex and relax over and over, as her hips begin to rock.</p><p>He moved his right hand further down her thigh, then rippled the back of his fingers over her lower lips. She whimpered. He did this several times, watching her face and her abdomen. She was very wet.</p><p>Using two fingers, he slid inside. She arched her back and cried out. Slowly, he moved his fingers in and out. He wanted to bring her like this, to watch her come.</p><p>He kept massaging her abdomen on the outside as he thrust his fingers inside.</p><p>Her hips pushed back, her neck arched, and she cried out. He drove his fingers faster. Her cries sharpened and fell from her lips one after the other until he could feel her internal muscles pulsing with ecstasy as she came.</p><p>She was so beautiful, her moans, her mouth open, her hands gripping the comforter, her hips pushing against his hand, reaching for that last bit of pleasure.</p><p>When at last she settled down, breathing hard, she turned to look at him.</p><p>\u201cThat was wonderful. Amazing. Your touch is almost magical.\u201d The words were hushed, then she sighed deeply.</p><p>He rose up, easing back. He continued to rub the inside of her thigh, the opposite leg now slack.</p><p>\u201cYour turn,\u201d she said, a sated smile on her lips. \u201cBut I think you should lose the clothes.\u201d He moved to stand between her legs, still spread for him so that his view was exactly what he wanted. He loved a woman\u2019s body, that her sex was a secret place to seek, find, and explore.</p><p>As he grabbed the bottom of his t- shirt, she lifted up on her elbows to watch, so he stripped slowly. He was built, a happy effect of his warrior job and of working out. He gave her the show she wanted, removing his shirt slowly and at the same time flexing various muscles and watching her gaze rove his shoulders, his pecs, his biceps. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He put his hand on his abs and flexed, then let his fingers glide slowly down his stomach. Her gaze followed.</p><p>She\u2019d already felt his arousal more than once, but she hadn\u2019t actually seen him.</p><p>He wanted her to have a good look, to see what would soon be inside her while he pierced her neck and took from her. He lowered his jeans, his cock jutting at a strong angle.</p> <p>To his surprise, she moved, and was off the bed, before he had a chance to think or to react. She fell on her knees on the floor in front of him, her hands on his hips as her mouth surrounded his cock.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d he muttered into the cool air of the room, her warm mouth a fire around him.</p><p>She suckled.</p><p>Oh, God, she sucked, deep pulls, bringing him as far into her mouth as she could get. She dipped her fingers below and teased his testicles.</p><p>Her head bobbed as she set a rhythm.</p> <p>It felt too damn good. He waited though, lasting as long as he could while watching the mass of her blond hair move up and down.</p><p>But it was too much.</p><p>He pulled back. \u201cI could come so easily like this, but I want more from you right now.\u201d She looked up at him, holding her mouth in a beautiful round shape. She nodded. \u201cSamuel, there\u2019s something I want from you, in this position first.\u201d He frowned, not understanding.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want your vein like this, while I\u2019m on my knees. Or would it be too much?\u201d Her words stunned him, that she would want to take him low like this.</p><p>Would it be too much? Maybe. But he didn\u2019t care. He loved that she wanted to drink from him at his groin and something inside his heart began to open and lean toward her. She was so free with her body, enjoying him. He\u2019d never allowed anyone to get this close before, not in his long century of ascended life.</p> <p>Never.</p><p>He looked down at his cock, twitching with need. \u201cI think it\u2019ll be okay.\u201d She leaned forward, kissed his groin and began swiping her tongue over his skin in long sweeps, a signal for the vein to rise.</p><p>He trembled. He wanted to feel her fangs. \u201cTake your fill, Vela.\u201d His most primal nature needed more than anything for his woman to have what she needed.</p><p>With one hand she held onto his hip and with her other, she rounded his body and gripped his ass.</p><p>Her head bobbed as she licked his skin, coaxing his vein to rise for her. He could feel the swelling a vampire could create, the vein rising, pushing upward, seeking the sharp points of a fang.</p><p>His cock responded, loving the attention. He had hard-on-hard right now.</p><p>Show me your fangs, he sent .</p><p>She tilted her head to look up at him, her eyes glinting in the dim light of the room. She parted her lips and there they were, two sharp elegant points.</p> <p>\u201cDo it,\u201d he commanded, his voice deep.</p><p>She turned, angled her head, and struck to the exact right depth. He shouted at the jab, followed by the sucking of her mouth, taking deep pulls from his life- blood.</p><p>He put a hand on her head and grunted his pleasure, as much from the sight of her sucking his vein as from the knowledge that he gave her something every vampire needed.</p><p>She moaned softly, her fingers digging into his ass. After a couple of minutes, she pulled back and he could feel the wounds closing up.</p><p>She arched her neck upward so that he could see her face. Her eyes were closed, a blush on her cheeks, her lips red.</p><p>His groin felt wounded and well-used and he loved it.</p><p>\u201cI feel stronger,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou look beautiful.\u201d She rose to her feet. \u201cI know what I want, but I\u2019m not sure how you\u2019ll feel about it.\u201d He kissed her. \u201cI\u2019ll give you anything right now, anything you ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I was at the counter earlier, your pressure on the small of my back, your touch, brought me. I want you to take me from behind and use your hand again, just like that.\u201d He shuddered because the thought of taking her in that position lit him up.</p><p>She smiled and kissed him. \u201cI take it the idea appeals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, yeah, it does.\u201d She slipped from his arms and bent over, not to get into position but to pull the covers back.</p><p>But the sight of her like that gave Samuel a different idea. He stepped close to her, almost unable to control himself.</p><p>\u201cLet me try something first. Bend over, but keep your feet on the floor. I mean, if that\u2019s okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, anything you want, I\u2019m game.\u201d Okay, he took a couple of breaths as she stretched out on the bed, her legs over the side, her ass rounded, firm, gorgeous.</p><p>She pulled her hair over one shoulder so that he had a perfect view of her damp wing-locks.</p><p>\u201cI need to taste you,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>She groaned softly.</p><p>He adjusted her legs, spreading her feet apart then dropped to his knees and dipped low, swiping his tongue over her swollen flesh, then thrust his tongue inside her. She whimpered.</p><p>You taste as I thought you would, like the sweetest flower. I could eat you like this forever. He set about proving himself as he dipped inside repeatedly.</p><p>He could tell she was almost ready to come again, so he quickened his tongue- thrusts and as she\u2019d asked, he massaged her lower back with his right hand.</p><p>She groaned first, a heavy, muffled sound against the comforter. Her hips writhed, then suddenly she arched her back and screamed. He continued the brisk plunging and the massaging until the orgasm rolled through her completely and her body began to loosen. Only then, when he was sure the last of the ecstasy had drifted away, did he stop.</p><p>A warrior could get used to this. He never took women to his home, his bed.</p><p>But somehow the thought of Vela being there one day made his heart swell again.</p><p>Was this the breh-hedden or was he really starting to feel something for this woman, something surprising?</p><p>She lifted herself up on her elbows and while looking back at him, she tugged her hair farther to the side, exposing her throat. \u201cHow about we go the distance and you tap my vein?\u201d He might have grunted something in response or growled, he wasn\u2019t sure.</p><p>Maybe a combination of both.</p><p>He positioned himself behind her and holding his cock got the right fit then he began to push. She moaned with each thrust of his hips.</p><p>\u201cHeaven,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou feel like heaven.\u201d He closed his eyes and savored the feel of her pulling on him as her hips pushed back with each thrust.</p><p>Her winglocks released fluids so that more of her scent reached him, that sweet, almost familiar floral scent that he couldn\u2019t quite place. He leaned over her and gently sucked on one of her wing- locks, which were extremely sensitive. A long low moan left her throat.</p><p>\u201cSamuel, you\u2019re killing me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRide it, Vela. Ride it hard.\u201d He sucked some more.</p><p>She panted several times then her voice rose in pitch until she was crying out once more, pleasure peaking, as he sucked her wing-lock and kept his cock hitting her just right, stroke after stroke.</p><p>But the flavor of her winglock moisture triggered something deep inside, something primal. He shifted so that he could reach the side of her neck. He licked her throat and drove his cock into her.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she whispered. \u201cPlease, yes.\u201d He licked over and over until her vein rose. He paused in his thrusts only long enough to bite hard once, retract and suck, then put his hips back to work.</p><p>Vela was strong and held her position beautifully. Taking her blood down his throat built a new fire in his body, giving him stamina. He pumped into her now, as he sucked, and each thrust sent a cry from her throat.</p><p>\u201cOh, God, Samuel,\u201d she cried out.</p><p>He sped up but finally released her throat. He held onto her hips and slammed into her. He felt her tighten and his orgasm arrived, a blinding pinnacle of white light and erotic pleasure, lightning streaking through his cock, flying up through his body, until the room spun. He shouted as he thrust, matching her cries that filled the room.</p><p>Then something happened and he could feel himself reloading. What the fuck?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to come again,\u201d rushed out of his mouth.</p><p>\u201cGood. I\u2019m ready. I don\u2019t know what this is, but it\u2019s amazing. I think it was taking your blood.\u201d She was so tight. He pummeled her once more and felt her release just as he came again, ecstasy carrying him along, doubling at the sounds of her cries and moans until at last she collapsed forward and he landed on top of her, spent.</p><p>He breathed hard, hoping to hell his weight didn\u2019t crush her.</p><p>\u201cOh, my God,\u201d she whispered. \u201cThat was unbelievable. If this is the breh- hedden, please give me more.\u201d He\u2019d been thinking the same thing.</p><p>He\u2019d never come twice like that but her blood had changed him, made him stronger.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t hurt you, did I?\u201d He kissed her cheek, and pushed her hair away from her face.</p><p>\u201cNo, not at all.\u201d When he could breathe again, he folded a washcloth from the bathroom into his hand and as he withdrew from her, he pressed it against her body. She turned on the bed and adjusted the cloth. He stretched out beside her, tugging her into his arms. Her lax, sated body flowed over his, an arm over his chest, a leg over his legs.</p><p>You feel so good, he sent, mind-to- mind.</p><p>I didn\u2019t expect this.</p><p>Me, neither. I thought\u2014 He cut off the words that he\u2019d been ready to stream through her mind.</p><p>But she drew back to look at him.</p><p>\u201cYou thought what?\u201d For a moment, he debated saying what was on his mind. But as he met her large blue, compassionate eyes, he let himself go. \u201cBecause of my power, I was reconciled to living by myself. I never even thought about having a woman in my life. But now, I mean, this is so damn fast \u2014\u201d What else could he say that wouldn\u2019t sound really stupid, like he\u2019d known her twenty-four hours but could actually see himself being with her, loving her, spending the rest of his life with her?</p><p>She kissed him, a long lingering kiss.</p><p>When she pulled back again, she said, \u201cI know what you mean. This is kind of ridiculous and so unexpected. But at the same time, extraordinary.\u201d His heart grew buoyant, a balloon barely tethered in place.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re extraordinary,\u201d he said, rubbing her arm lightly. He wanted to do this all over again. \u201cI want to know everything about you.\u201d Still looking at him from within his tight embrace, she caressed his face. He moaned softly and turned to kiss the palm of her hand. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Enter my mind, she sent.</p><p>Had he heard her right? He met her gaze again. \u201cYou want me to mind-dive?</p><p>Deep mind engagement?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI want you to know me. We\u2019re in this, Samuel. And my instincts tell me that we\u2019re in trouble, real trouble. The better you know who I am, the better we\u2019ll be able to function together. But I can feel your hesitation.\u201d Hesitation didn\u2019t begin to describe what he felt. \u201cI have to be honest with you; I\u2019m completely opposed to the idea because I won\u2019t be able to return the favor. My power is unstable. I\u2019d never forgive myself if I hurt you. But beyond that, Vela, that prison was the worst nightmare you can imagine.\u201d</p><p>Vela met his worried gaze, squinting as if in pain. \u201cYou\u2019re afraid I\u2019ll see those images.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMind-diving doesn\u2019t just release one image, it releases from the pool of everything I\u2019ve experienced. I doubt it\u2019s controllable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I guess not.\u201d She thought about her marriage. Samuel would see it all, the good and the bad, the love-making, the fights. She\u2019d once thrown out an entire salmon dinner because of some comment Jeff had made.</p><p>She chuckled softly.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny? I don\u2019t think this is funny at all.\u201d So, she told him about the salmon and he started to laugh. He kept chuckling on and off. \u201cPlease don\u2019t tell me you think that\u2019s your worst flaw that you get ticked off and toss out perfectly good food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I guess not. But I\u2019ll tell you what I do know; that I trust you enough to let you in, enough to let you see whatever is there.\u201d She forced herself to relax, to breathe. She thought about her darkening ability, about Duncan and Merl, and that she had just had mind-blowing sex with Warrior Samuel. For months now, she\u2019d been feeling an internal pressure, a need to be doing something, she just hadn\u2019t known what. She had thought it would be related to Fiona\u2019s rehab center, now she wasn\u2019t sure at all because this felt right, being with Samuel and engaging her darkening power.</p><p>A new path had grabbed her and she didn\u2019t want to hold back, not now. She suspected that her life, her survival, would depend on forging ahead with strength and commitment, that nothing less would do.</p><p>She shifted her body so that her legs slid off of his and she lay completely on her side next to him. She planted a hand on his muscular chest and for a split-second almost got lost in his physicality.</p><p>She blinked a couple of times and cleared her head. \u201cDo this, Samuel. I don\u2019t know the why of it, but it\u2019s important.</p><p>Do some deep-mind engagement and let\u2019s see what happens.</p> <p>Okay?\u201d He shifted toward her and kissed her, then leaned back and closed his eyes. She watched him for a moment. He had fine lines beside his eyes and even now a certain tightness characterized his expression.</p><p>When she felt his mind approach hers, she closed her eyes as well. But when she started to slide her hand off his chest, he caught and held it, which made her heart leap in a way she didn\u2019t think was wise at all. The first flutter of love awakened in her heart. Was it too much to ask that she might actually fall in love with this man as well?</p><p>She set the thought aside and relaxed her mind. She felt him approach like a soft caress. Mind-diving was so different from telepathy, which was essentially a mere laying of words over the mind.</p><p>But this, as Samuel pushed the barrier of her mind and slipped inside, was incredible. He was there now, a formidable presence in her mind, more than she\u2019d expected. She understood something about him right then, that Samuel didn\u2019t really know the extent of his dark power, this Third Earth ability birthed during his captivity.</p><p>Of course, a new problem emerged since she really liked him being inside her mind. Her body heated up instantly, her breasts tingling.</p><p>He chuckled softly. You like me here.</p><p>Your scent is flowing from you.</p><p>I\u2019m tempted all over again. Next time, be inside me like this.</p> <p>He moaned. Okay, this isn\u2019t helping.</p><p>It seems to take so little.</p><p>Right. She forced herself to breathe.</p><p>Focus on where you were born.</p><p>Good idea. She aimed her thoughts into the past, remembering her parents and living in Philadelphia Two in the early 1800s, in what was then, by comparison, a small town. Learning to fly, almost drowning when she flew too close to a lake and her wings got caught in the water, which had been a nightmare. Riding horses and loving it. Growing up and falling in and out of love. Learning to play the piano, expected of a woman in those days. Then choosing a life of travel for a long time, folding from town to town, getting to know her local American world, north and south, learning several languages.</p><p>She\u2019d had itchy feet, never wanting to stay long in one place. She\u2019d taken many lovers and felt Samuel tense when a lovemaking image would flow through her thoughts.</p><p>Then a close call with a death vampire in 1922, slain by a Militia Warrior, a man who had finally spoken to her heart deeply enough that she\u2019d married him. Jeff Barker. The grief of being childless and overcoming that grief. Of living with him for decades until his death five-years-ago. How much she\u2019d loved making their house a true home, which she still lived in, a small piece of property near the downtown Borderland. Without thinking, she fell into her grief, remembering how often she\u2019d wept, screamed, shouted. At one point, she almost pulled back, but Samuel whispered through her mind, No, let me see it.</p><p>Please.</p><p>She felt his permission to just feel all that she had lost so she did. He caressed her hand at the same time. What surprised her was that as she remembered Jeff\u2019s funeral pyre, Samuel\u2019s presence within her mind became a tremendous comfort.</p><p>He even reached for her and pulled her on top of him and held her in his arms as once again she wept for the man she had loved and lost to the war.</p><p>Somewhere in that shedding of grief, Samuel withdrew from her mind so that when she stopped crying she felt an emptiness that stunned her. But he cradled her gently, the heat of his male body soothing her. She sighed heavily.</p><p>\u201cYou loved him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo very much. But thank you for being with me like this. I don\u2019t feel quite so heartsick right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. You\u2019re an amazing woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not.\u201d She chuckled. \u201cI\u2019m just me. I know I don\u2019t have Havily\u2019s style and ambition or Endelle\u2019s flamboyance and power. I don\u2019t see myself fitting in with these incredible women. I\u2019m just me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you don\u2019t see yourself clearly, how you picked up and left home to travel at a time when even female ascenders didn\u2019t move around all that much. And then when you married your warrior, how you gave yourself completely to marriage, nothing held back. That\u2019s a great quality to have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I have to work at it. The reason I traveled the way I did wasn\u2019t just because I thought it would fun or enriching, but because when I almost drowned I became afraid of the world and afraid to live. Traveling was a way to overcome that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut don\u2019t you see, most people don\u2019t even take that step. They stay stuck.</p><p>Shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike me. I\u2019m stuck. This is the first time I\u2019ve seen even a pinpoint of light at the end of this tunnel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe it would be a good thing to at least try a mind-dive with me. I mean, you had a life before being captured.</p><p>Maybe you could just work to release those images.\u201d She felt his resolution, however, that he was determined to keep his years of torture from her. So, she let it go.</p><p>Instead, she asked him what his favorite food was - lasagna - and a dozen other things that he could answer freely, which he did. He\u2019d been a Militia Warrior since his ascension out of St.</p><p>Louis One in 1908. He\u2019d served as part of many civic policing forces throughout North America Two, battling death vampires in a squad of four warriors night in and night out.</p><p>He liked tequila, maybe a little too much. He spent plenty of time at the Blood and Bite, but refused to answer specific questions about the mortal women who frequented that establishment. He\u2019d only been assigned to the Phoenix Metro area six months before he was taken.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been a warrior all my life.</p><p>Even on Mortal Earth, I\u2019d intended on becoming a Marine when I received my call to ascension.\u201d By now she lay on her side next to him, leaning her head on her hand, her elbow on the bed supporting her so she could look at him as he spoke. He still lay on his back, his arm over his head.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that like?\u201d she asked, curious as all Twolings were, born on Second Earth, about the experience of a rite of ascension. \u201cI\u2019d love to mind-dive just to see what it was like for you. Did you have a Guardian of Ascension?\u201d All really powerful ascenders received Guardians of Ascension to keep them safe from the enemy who wanted to either subvert them and use their power or to kill them outright.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNo, not at all.</p><p>Nothing like that. I had a liaison officer who was so bored with her job that I\u2014\u201d He cut off his thought.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she cried. Then she shoved him with her hand. \u201cYou bonked her.\u201d He smiled but he looked embarrassed as well. \u201cWhat can I say?</p><p>That pretty much summed up my rite of ascension. I spent three days in the sack with her.\u201d Vela laughed. \u201cShe didn\u2019t want more afterwards?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. We both knew it was just sex and besides, I went into the Militia Warrior Training Camp right afterward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStraight away? Not even one question that this was the right path?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. I knew what I was. But let me tell you, the day I mounted my wings for the first time was unbelievable.\u201d He turned to look at her, his arm still angled over the top of his head. \u201cYou want to go flying some time?\u201d She moaned softly. \u201cI\u2019d love it. I haven\u2019t been flying\u2014\u201d she broke off, took a deep breath, then added, \u201cNot in five years. I mount my wings of course to keep them healthy, but no, I haven\u2019t been flying in a long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll go. Have you ever flown off the Mogollon Rim in Sedona?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOne of my favorites, catching the currents that stream down all those gullies, and inlets, through the canyon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll do that,\u201d he repeated, nodding.</p><p>He was more open than she\u2019d supposed he would be.

He spoke for a long time as he recalled the images he\u2019d seen.</p> <p>She laughed at some, was embarrassed by others, let a few more tears fall, and finally got all worked up when he mentioned a couple of her lovers and began growling against her neck. One thing led to another and he was inside her again, thrusting hard and making her groan, whimper, and cry out all over again.</p><p>She fell asleep afterwards, not even aware she\u2019d done so.</p><p>Samuel woke her up much later by caressing her arm gently and whispering, \u201cIt\u2019s eleven thirty. Our chain-smoking host will be back soon.\u201d</p><p>Samuel heard Merl calling to him, just as Vela emerged from the bathroom, her thick blond hair, now loose with that wild look he really liked. She wore fresh clothes; a pair of dark blue jeans and a light blue tank. She shrugged into a mottled blue sweater. She wore black flats. He had to restrain a sudden impulse to take her in his arms again.</p><p>He cleared his throat. \u201cMerl\u2019s back.\u201d He felt her tense up immediately, aware, just as he was, that they\u2019d be taking their next step right now.</p> <p>He took her hand. \u201cWe\u2019ll figure this out.\u201d He\u2019d been making war a long time, but Vela had no experience at all, which set his nerves on edge. From the brief encounter he\u2019d had with the darkening, the wreckers had power, skill, and deadly intent. And he had no idea how they\u2019d be able to get around them to secure Duncan and pull him out of his Third prison.</p><p>But then again, some problems could only be solved one step at a time.</p><p>He led her back to the open, tall- ceilinged living room, but he didn\u2019t get far. Damn that Merl. The bastard was dressed to kill in a too-tight black t-shirt, his pecs flexing below the ceiling pot- lights. He wore black leather pants and boots with silver goddamn buckles. His dark hair, combed straight back, gave him that come-and-get-it look.</p><p>And he wore his smirk with fucking pride, his hazel eyes flashing with challenge.</p><p>Still holding Vela\u2019s hand, Samuel pulled her close, but she shoved at him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re hurting me.\u201d He turned to her scowling. \u201cWhat?\u201d She held up their joined hands. \u201cThis hurts. Let go. Now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFuck. Sorry.\u201d The breh-hedden had fired up his caveman instincts, putting them in overdrive. He released her hand, but he couldn\u2019t help stepping in front of her just a little.</p><p>He heard her groan and he was pretty sure she\u2019d just rolled her eyes. She breezed past him anyway, which ignited two disparate sensations at once: a sudden profound desire to haul her back to the bedroom and teach her what she needed to know about being his woman and pride that she wasn\u2019t cowed by his stupid behavior.</p><p>Conflicted as he was, he followed after her and somehow managed to keep his hands to himself. At least she had the good sense to stop fifteen-feet away from Merl. Any closer, and he\u2019d be wrestling all over again with a man who clearly had more power than he did. But like hell he would care about that. Maybe he\u2019d tap into more of his power and wouldn\u2019t that be a kick in the balls for the asshole still smirking at him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you wasted all this time I gave you in a perfectly empty house,\u201d Merl taunted. \u201cWhat? Couldn\u2019t get it up?\u201d That did it. He started to release his dark power when suddenly Vela stood in front of him, both hands planted on his chest. \u201cWe are so not doing this,\u201d she shouted.</p><p>He took a step back. He even lifted both hands in surrender.</p><p>He was about to start apologizing or something, but Vela then turned all that feminine rage on Merl. \u201cAnd you! You\u2019re the worst. Why do you taunt my man like that?\u201d Her man? She\u2019d called him her man?</p><p>He started growling a soft kind of purr as he moved in behind her.</p><p>But she jerked away from him again and shook her finger at him. \u201cWould you please get hold of this caveman shit before I go ballistic.\u201d She turned the same menacing finger on Merl. \u201cBoth of you!\u201d When Merl also did his face-the- sheriff stance, hands up, she flared her nostrils in the prettiest way, lifted one brow, then shifted slowly in Merl\u2019s direction. \u201cOkay, that\u2019s a little better.</p> <p>Now what did your Third refugee associates have to say about our little predicament? How do we get to Duncan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate to tell you this, but after debating your situation for the past several hours, we don\u2019t have an answer. You can\u2019t get to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? What do you mean we can\u2019t?\u201d He shrugged. \u201cYou fucking can\u2019t.</p><p>Ascender Alison closed up the Gateway to Third right after she opened it. And I think Sixth Ascender, James or Braulio, or whatever the hell his name is, added his own mojo. That baby\u2019s locked up tight.</p><p>No one in, no one out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you said Third Ascenders have been making their way into this dimension.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think Sharav may have rigged something up, but I sure as hell don\u2019t know how to access it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t understand,\u201d Vela said.</p><p>\u201cI know that Grace could fold to Fourth, no problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFourth is a more advanced, open society. They went through the Council of Sixth, millennia ago, and as a society agreed to open their Gateway. The Council has a say in all Gateway matters.</p><p>But Fourth is the exception.</p><p>\u201cAnd since Second Earth contains generally less powerful entities, except Endelle of course and Thorne, who is showing immense promise, well, it looks like Sharav, no doubt with Chustaffus\u2019s blessing, has found a way through.\u201d Vela looked back at the wall that held the darkening gate. \u201cWhat if we got hold of a wrecker\u2019s shotgun. We could then blow a hole in the darkening wall of Duncan\u2019s prison and bring him out that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a great plan,\u201d Merl said sarcastically. At the same time, he drew a lit cigarette into his hand from who knew where. He took a long pull, one eye squinting. \u201cJust tell me one thing: How are you going to get a weapon away from a goddamn wrecker?\u201d Vela narrowed her gaze. \u201cYou know, for a man with power, you sure don\u2019t show much game.\u201d Samuel snorted. Merl blew smoke in Vela\u2019s direction. \u201cI\u2019m gonna let that go because you have no idea what would be involved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen tell us, so we can be astounded at how stupid my suggestion was.\u201d He sank into what seemed to be his favorite corner chair, leaning his head against the back cushion. He stared at Vela, but no smirk this time. Samuel liked him like this, less smooth, more I\u2019m pissed at you.</p><p>\u201cFine. Your first problem is that wrecker weapons are identified, like swords. And I don\u2019t know anyone who can alter an identification like that.\u201d But Vela glanced at Samuel. \u201cI do.</p><p>Alison altered Leto\u2019s sword identification at the Tolleson arena battle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Samuel hadn\u2019t yet escaped from his captivity when Alison went through her rite of ascension, a process that for her had involved battling Warrior Leto in an arena, sword-on- sword. \u201cI heard about that.\u201d Merl puffed on his cigarette again.</p><p>\u201cBut swords are different than wrecker weapons.\u201d Vela waved a hand dismissively.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s say we get hold of a weapon, and we can alter the identification, what next?</p><p>You\u2019ve operated one, how do you use it?\u201d Merl frowned at her, his brows pinching together. \u201cYou\u2019re serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s a place to begin. So unless you have a better idea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.</p><p>I suppose if wrecker technology hasn\u2019t changed all that much in fifty years, you just pull the trigger while releasing a jolt of your own personal power. But I think you\u2019re out of your mind to even consider doing this. So why are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s simple. I know Duncan, and Rachel is my friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Rachel?\u201d He took another drag, his elbow on the arm of the chair.</p><p>\u201cDuncan\u2019s on-again, off-again girlfriend. Mostly off. So, let\u2019s just say that I believe it\u2019s my duty to do everything I can to help Duncan. His plight came to me in a darkening vision and that\u2019s all that needs to be said anymore. I go where I\u2019m called, just as I came here when we were being pursued by wreckers.\u201d Merl shifted his gaze to the toe of his boot. \u201cYou\u2019re an idealist.\u201d Vela laughed. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not. Far from it, and I do understand the hopelessness of this situation. But I don\u2019t intend to give up.\u201d He met her gaze once more. \u201cEven it means dying in the process?\u201d Vela didn\u2019t shift her gaze from Merl.</p><p>\u201cYes, even if it means dying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, fuck.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>Vela heard the words come out of her mouth, but she still didn\u2019t quite believe that she\u2019d become this person, where her new darkening power was concerned. Yet there seemed no alternate response to the truth that her power had brought her to Duncan\u2019s cell. Responsibility for him had descended on her; and she would see this through, even in the face of death.</p><p>Samuel worked his molars again. \u201cI think we need to bring Alison and Fiona in on this.\u201d Vela frowned. \u201cI can understand Alison, but why Fiona?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause she has the ability to enhance power. If the four of us were in the darkening, and figured out a way to draw one of the wreckers close enough, I could use my dark power and force the weapon away from the wrecker. Then Alison could do her thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan she even reconfigure a weapon like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we\u2019d know soon enough.</p><p>Then once we had the weapon, we could go after Duncan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t work.\u201d Merl rested his jaw on his curved hand, his fingers holding the lit cigarette away from his face.</p><p>\u201cWhich part?\u201d Vela turned to Samuel because they\u2019d each said the same thing at the same time. She smiled and his lips curved. He nodded. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell, first,\u201d Merl said, \u201cwreckers never work alone. They patrol in squads of three, so you\u2019re talking about battling three Third Earth, very powerful warriors, each with an identified weapon. But let\u2019s say the whole thing with Alison and Fiona works and you gain possession of at least one of the weapons, without dying, by then the grid monitors would have already detected a point of chaos. Add that to a loss of contact with the wreckers and the monitors would have already sent in another squad after you. Before you even figured out how to fire the damn thing, they\u2019d be up your ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we get the weapon and come back here,\u201d Samuel said. \u201cSimple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSimple, huh? For a Militia Warrior, you\u2019ve got balls.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs that a compliment, Merl?\u201d Merl puffed on his cigarette, eye squinting. \u201cJust commenting on your general stupidity,\u201d he countered, holding back the smoke then blowing it out in a quick stream. \u201cAll right, let\u2019s break it down. How do you plan on facing-off three Third Earth wreckers, each with a weapon that could blow your ass into a million pieces?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe get Thorne in on this and Warrior Leto after he\u2019s morphed into his beast-state.\u201d Leto had developed a new power in that he could increase his size and strength by just a thought.</p><p>With the addition of two of the most powerful vampires on Second Earth, Vela felt confident that the plan could work, although they had one more step to take.</p><p>She turned toward Samuel. \u201cDespite Merl\u2019s objections, I think this is a good place to start, but we\u2019re going to need Madame Endelle in on this. She\u2019s got to be informed every step of the way because this is about Third Earth. If she has a new threat on her hands, she\u2019ll need all the details we can provide. Besides, I\u2019m pretty sure that she won\u2019t give us Leto and Thorne without some convincing.\u201d Merl sat forward in his chair and stubbed out his cigarette in an ashtray at his elbow. \u201cYeah, you should definitely include Endelle.\u201d Samuel snorted. \u201cNow why am I not surprised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck off.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBack atcha, asshole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you two going to start that again?\u201d Merl glared at her. \u201cOnly if your boyfriend doesn\u2019t shut the fuck up.\u201d She leveled her gaze at Samuel.</p><p>Though he opened his mouth, his chin at a stubborn angle, he returned her stare, grimaced, then swallowed his retort.</p><p>Vela drew her phone from her pant pocket and called Jeannie at Central.</p><p>\u201cHey, girl. Yeah, it\u2019s me, smack dab in the middle of hell, carrying my hand-basket.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeard it\u2019s the breh-hedden?\u201d Vela tensed up then forced herself to relax. So it was now common knowledge.</p> <p>But after what had happened in the workout center, she could hardly expect anything different. \u201cYeah. It is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou deserve it, Vela, that kind of love. And I wouldn\u2019t say that to just anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Jeannie. You\u2019re such a good friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. So what\u2019s your breh like? Everyone, and I do mean everyone, is talking about Warrior Samuel. I heard a rumor he\u2019s the next Warrior of the Blood. Do you think it\u2019s possible?\u201d She glanced at Samuel whose lips were compressed as he tried to ignore Merl. Merl kept waving his fingers toward Samuel.</p><p>She interceded on a whisper. \u201cStop that.\u201d Merl smirked, but he lowered his arm. \u201cYou\u2019re worse than my brothers growing up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop what and who\u2019s worse?\u201d Jeannie asked.</p><p>\u201cNothing and nobody. Listen, as soon as I\u2019m out of this fix, let\u2019s get coffee, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet. Now how can I help?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI need a secure location, probably the palace, to bring over a Third ascender with a Peter Pan complex, myself, and Warrior Samuel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA Third ascender?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard me right.\u201d Jeannie whistled. \u201cI\u2019ve already got orders from Her Supremeness to do whatever you wanted. I have the fold set.</p><p>Tell me when.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me check.\u201d She held her phone by her leg and asked if the men could stop posturing long enough to join Endelle at the palace.</p><p>But Samuel held his hand up for a moment, then waved it once over his body. Poof: flight battle gear, including that damn sexy leather kilt.</p><p>Vela may have weaved slightly on her feet. After swallowing hard, she asked, \u201cCan I give Jeannie the word?\u201d Samuel nodded.</p><p>Merl did the same.</p><p>Bringing her phone back to her ear, she said, \u201cFold at will.\u201d Central had a lot of power and the sudden brisk ride through nether-space was smooth as silk. Some believed that the disappearing-reappearing power typical of all five Upper Dimensions wasn\u2019t about dematerialization at all, but the folding of space, hence the term. The debate still raged in all the major universities, but it was one of those theories hard to prove.</p><p>Whatever it was, Vela had always enjoyed folding-travel.</p><p>And as before, the moment she started down the ramp, Samuel took her hand in his.</p><p>Merl glanced around. \u201cSome digs.</p><p>Ro-tun-das.\u201d The sing-song way he spread the word out made Vela chuckle.</p><p>\u201cWhite mar-ble,\u201d he added.</p><p>More sing-song, more laughter.</p><p>She turned to smile at him, but Samuel caught her eye and glared. He\u2019s flirting.</p><p>Now she smiled at Samuel. No he\u2019s not. He\u2019s just being himself and he\u2019s funny.</p><p>What-the-fuck-ever.</p><p>She chuckled some more, but squeezed his hand. I think he wants to meet Endelle more than anything else.</p><p>Ya think?</p><p>Then you should stop worrying about his designs on me.</p><p>He\u2019s the kind of man who has designs on every woman.</p><p>This time, she met his gaze as they moved into Thorne\u2019s Command Center.</p><p>And you don\u2019t?</p><p>This time, his lips curved and he didn\u2019t quite meet her in the eye as he said, Used to.</p><p>Just as I thought, though she squeezed his hand again.</p><p>Thorne left one of the nearest stations and led them once more to Endelle\u2019s private suite explaining that Jeannie had already let him know what was happening and that Endelle was on her way.</p><p>Vela moved to the far end of the couch, but Samuel chose to stand near her off to the side of the adjacent purple chair.</p><p>Samuel introduced Merl, who had planted his feet opposite the couch, his arms folded over his chest.</p><p>Thorne held Merl\u2019s gaze forcefully, like he knew exactly what game Merl played. But Merl stared back unaffected.</p><p>Given the stature of each, the stare lasted a long time.</p><p>Merl appeared to enjoy pissing contests.</p><p>She wondered what Endelle would think of Merl.</p><p>Samuel thought Merl had probably jumped from the womb playing with fire because the moment Endelle entered the room, he turned the force of his flirtations on the leader of Second Earth.</p><p>Merl made a long speech, saying things about being humbled to meet She Who Would Live and that he\u2019d looked forward to this moment for five decades.</p><p>He took her hand, kissed her fingers.</p><p>Samuel had heard Endelle had hooked up with the Sixth ascender, Braulio, who, rumor had it, was also the Sixth ascender, James. Weird fucking times on Second Earth.</p><p>What the hell is he doing? Vela slipped into Samuel\u2019s mind easily. And he liked it.</p><p>He glanced down at her, met her gaze, and shrugged. Hell if I know. But Braulio had better make an appearance pretty quick.</p><p>No, shit.</p><p>Samuel withheld a smile, but he met Thorne\u2019s astonished gaze. Thorne shook his head as though he couldn\u2019t figure Merl out either.</p><p>A moment later, Alison and Fiona entered, looking puffy-eyed but beautiful from being awakened in the middle of the night. At first, Samuel thought Merl might attempt to spread his charms in their direction, but he remained fixed on Endelle, a predatory glint in his eye.</p><p>Endelle, however, turned a shoulder to the interloper, made the introductions to Alison and Fiona, then had Vela lay out her plans.</p><p>The women listened quietly, eyes wide.</p><p>\u201cCan you do this for us?\u201d Vela asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Alison said.</p><p>Fiona nodded.</p><p>Vela addressed Alison. \u201cAnd you think you could reconfigure one of the shotguns?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll know as soon as I approach one.\u201d Alison repressed a yawn and blinked a couple of times. She had a flying toddler at home and needed her sleep.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll want Leto as well,\u201d Endelle said. \u201cYou three women need to work on these skills and see what you can figure out. We\u2019ve got to get a wrecker weapon, one that will take down a darkening grid wall, so that we can pull Duncan out of his cell. Are we all clear on this?\u201d Nods and murmurs followed.</p><p>Samuel had to admit he felt oddly comfortable in this room, as though his dark power recognized the other ascenders. Which sparked other thoughts, not so pleasant, like his deepest fears that somewhere in this necessary exercise, his currently dormant streams of energy would hurt one of these people accidentally.</p><p>He corralled his thoughts, however, and focused on Vela. She appeared calm, but her foot bounced, not surprisingly. His role to support and defend was one thing, but Vela led the charge.</p><p>Endelle\u2019s voice intruded. \u201cAll right, let\u2019s give the women some space to work.\u201d Thorne led the way for the men and Endelle to leave the room. Once well into the next rotunda, he drew the party to a stop and asked for more details about the darkening grid, the explosions, and Duncan\u2019s cell.</p><p>Samuel knew the drill and gave as many relational points as he could; length of travel time, dimension of the cell, the changing state of the floor as one location surpassed the next, the size of the grid tunnels, and anything else that came to mind. Merl added what he knew as well.</p><p>Thorne listened intently, his hazel eyes shifting between both men.</p><p>When Samuel finished his account, Thorne called out to Jeannie and requested Leto to join them right away.</p><p>Leto had taken Thorne\u2019s sister, Grace, as h i s breh, so that essentially they were brothers-in-law.</p><p>Leto arrived within the next few minutes but Endelle\u2019s first words were, \u201cWe\u2019ll need you in your beast-state. You, Thorne, and Samuel are headed to Third in the darkening.\u201d Leto\u2019s brows rose and though he stared back from faintly astonished blue eyes, he merely nodded. With a blur of movement, he morphed into what he called his beast state, although he appeared exactly the same, just bigger. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And taller.</p><p>Samuel hadn\u2019t seen him this close up, but even he could agree the warrior looked like a god. \u201cFuck,\u201d he drawled.</p><p>\u201cGet used to it.\u201d But the words came from both Merl and Leto at the same time.</p> <p>\u201cI take it this kind of thing is common on Third Earth?\u201d Endelle pivoted toward Merl.</p><p>\u201cIt is.\u201d Endelle held his gaze. \u201cSo we\u2019re really in this.\u201d His crooked smile spoke his compassion. \u201cLooks like it.\u201d Endelle glanced at Samuel. \u201cBring Leto up to speed.\u201d Samuel laid it out, all that had happened as well as the current plan. But it was Merl who picked up the thread and gave the missing details about the wrecking squads. He explained what the warriors would be up against, how quickly the squads could move, how powerful they were, the nature of the weapons, and the odds looked pretty bad.</p><p>\u201cWhat about you, Merl?\u201d Endelle said, breaking the theme of this can\u2019t really be done, with, \u201cYou gonna help out with this party? You got a pair of balls in those snug leathers of yours, or are you just a handsome face and all talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWish I could, but I\u2019ve got a grid death warrant on my head put there by every faction involved. You\u2019d have several squads after you the moment my signature lit up the darkening.\u201d Alison appeared at the doorway and called to them. \u201cPlease come back. We\u2019ve got something going on in here. Vela\u2019s feeling a call to the Illinois Seers Palace?\u201d Samuel moved fast and found Vela trembling as she stood near the glass coffee table. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother call.\u201d As soon as the rest of the party entered the room, however, she addressed Endelle. \u201cSomething\u2019s going on and it\u2019s big and it involves the Seers Palace, the one that Greaves built.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe shut it down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Endelle took on her best scorpion look, ready, apparently, to take Vela apart for questioning her, but one of Thorne\u2019s assistants arrived and spoke in a low voice to him.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he murmured. He stood very still for a moment, his gaze stricken.</p><p>Finally, he said, \u201cI have to check on something. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThorne, what the hell is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me find out what\u2019s going on.\u201d He disappeared into the hall beyond.</p> <p>The entire room fell silent, tense, waiting.</p><p>No one spoke.</p><p>Vela gripped Samuel\u2019s arm. This can\u2019t be good.</p><p>No.</p><p>He sent nothing more, just a flat \u2018no\u2019 that echoed through her mind.</p><p>She kept her gaze fixed on the doorway, as did everyone else, but grew even more anxious when Thorne\u2019s footsteps sounded in the rotunda beyond.</p><p>She pulled the top corners of her sweater together with her free hand.</p><p>Thorne arrived on the threshold, his lips in a tight, grim line.</p> <p>\u201cOkay, what the fuck is going on?\u201d Endelle asked.</p><p>Thorne just stared at her.</p><p>\u201cDid one of Greaves\u2019s former generals attack?\u201d Endelle\u2019s chest rose and fell, the seashells clattering softly.</p><p>\u201cAll three of them. Looks like it was a coordinated, planned assault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many Militia Warriors did we lose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOver two thousand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, Jesus.\u201d She shaded her face with her hand.</p><p>Vela gasped.</p><p>Samuel murmured a low, \u201cOh, God, no.\" Leto shook his head, but glanced at Thorne. \u201cAnd we knew nothing about it?</p><p>How is this possible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just spoke with Marguerite. Her crew, who works the Future Streams twenty-four-seven, saw nothing. Not a hint, a whisper, nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus. What the fuck does this mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarguerite took a few seconds to dive in to take a look at the Illinois Two Seers Palace and she couldn\u2019t get a reading.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Endelle\u2019s voice carried a bit of resonance and that made Fiona groan. Fiona really couldn\u2019t handle resonance.</p><p>Vela knew that the Illinois Seers Palace had been one of Greaves\u2019s primary tools against Madame Endelle. Owen Stannett had harnessed Seers together and provided unparalleled information until he lost himself in the pleasure of the experience and Greaves got rid of him.</p><p>Her instincts began to thrum heavily as she thought about the Palace. The call returned, a kind of strong pull of her entire body into the darkening.</p><p>\u201cLet me take a look,\u201d she said, drawing all eyes to her.</p><p>\u201cGo,\u201d Endelle said.</p><p>She heard Samuel setting up a protest, but she knew this would be quick and easy, very different from a jaunt to Third.</p><p>She flowed straight back into the grid and began hurtling through the tunnels but not in the direction of Third Earth.</p><p>Suddenly, she reached her destination and knew she was deep inside the Illinois Seers Palace.</p><p>She remained very still, something her instincts told her would buy her some time.</p><p>She looked around. The chamber was made of black marble tile, with a viewing platform that looked down into a sort of pit. Seven chaise-longues were set in a row and reclining in the middle was a man she\u2019d never seen before, but he had three braids on either side of his head looped into a clasp with the rest of his long hair.</p><p>He had a prominent nose and a carefully trimmed black goatee. She knew this was the man who\u2019d hurt Samuel: Sharav.</p><p>Oh, God.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to be here. If he was, who Merl said he was, then one of Chustaffus\u2019s henchmen had taken over the Illinois Seer\u2019s Palace.</p><p>He held a cell in his hand and every once in a while spoke into the cell. Vela knew he relayed information, but to whom?</p><p>Strapped to the chaise-longues were six women, of varying ethnicities, each wearing a white linen robe, and each grimacing as if in pain, eyes closed, sunk in a trance.</p><p>Her instincts pushed her forward until she pressed her mind against Sharav\u2019s and slid in, just as she had with Endelle earlier. The image stunned her, of herself naked, in the darkening, lying on a stone floor.</p><p>The image meant something, but what?</p><p>Sharav opened his eyes, so she quickly pulled out. He looked in her direction, but didn\u2019t make eye contact which meant he still couldn\u2019t see her. He rubbed his goatee. All the women relaxed and many whimpered in relief.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s there?</p><p>Great.</p><p>More darkening shit. I don\u2019t need this.\u201d He reached out his hand and folded a second strange looking cell-phone into it.</p><p>The words he spoke chilled her to the bone. \u201cI need a wrecker here. Now. \u201d Vela didn\u2019t need a further hint. She turned and headed back the way she\u2019d come, but shortly after she started moving, a blast sounded not far from her.</p><p>She returned to Endelle\u2019s sitting room, sweating and trembling. She sealed the doorway again, her arms high and spread out, her power flowed, but she knew she didn\u2019t have enough juice to complete the job.</p><p>\u201cMerl,\u201d she called out. \u201cNeed your help here.\u201d But Merl was already there, hands planted on the wall and she felt the entry point seal up.</p><p>She stepped back, staring at the darkening wall, watching it fade. In the great distance, she heard another blast but the wreckers were too late.</p><p>When she turned, Samuel took her by the arms. \u201cWhere the hell did you go?</p><p>Vela, don\u2019t take off like that again. At least take me with, for Christ\u2019s sake. Fuck, you\u2019re shaking.\u201d He drew her into his arms.</p><p>She held onto him breathing hard. He slid his hand beneath the mass of her hair to the back of her neck and rubbed, which helped, but she struggled to process what she\u2019d seen, how close the wreckers had gotten to her. Beyond that, what about the vision of herself lying naked, in the darkening, on a stone floor?</p><p>She couldn\u2019t seem to calm the hell down.</p><p>Endelle turned to Alison. \u201cCan you help us here?\u201d Alison moved in and placed her hand on Vela\u2019s head. The most wonderful warmth and compassion flowed and she finally took a deep breath. In slow stages, Vela began to calm down until she pulled away from Samuel.</p><p>An odd vibration passed through her, a kind of knowing, as she shifted in Alison\u2019s direction. Suddenly, she felt Alison, all that the woman experienced on a deep level as she applied her healing gift. She felt Alison\u2019s fatigue, her level of anxiety for her young daughter\u2019s safety, that she worried about her breh, Kerrick, all that time.</p><p>On instinct, Vela met Alison\u2019s gaze and as though flipping an internal switch, she turned the same compassion back on Alison, as though she reflected the woman\u2019s power.</p><p>Healing warmth reversed, flowing out of Vela\u2019s mind and heart into the woman whose hand still rested on Vela\u2019s head.</p><p>Alison drew back, her brows lifted in surprise. She\u2019d broken the contact and now stared at her hand. \u201cWhat is that?</p><p>What just happened?\u201d But the power still flowed, so she extended her palm toward Alison. \u201cMay I?\u201d Alison stared at Vela\u2019s hand for a long moment, then finally nodded.</p><p>Vela placed her hand on Alison\u2019s forehead and as more healing flowed, the powerful ascender breathed a deep sigh of relief and murmured, \u201cHeaven.\u201d Vela kept up the process, wondering how this was even possible, how she could actually give back what Alison had given.</p><p>When the sensation dimmed, Vela drew her hand back.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is going on?\u201d Endelle barked. \u201cWe have a warrior to save. What did you just do to Alison?\u201d Vela stared at her own hand. \u201cI\u2019m not sure. I felt she was distressed and offered the same comfort she had just given me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was amazing.\u201d Alison shook her head, her lips parted, brows raised.</p><p>\u201cAnd I actually feel at ease for the first time in a long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s what you just gave me.</p><p>So, thank you.\u201d Alison smiled, her blue, gold- rimmed eyes full of light. \u201cI\u2019m just amazed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, knock it off with all this touchy-feely shit.\u201d Endelle\u2019s voice rang through the room. \u201cVela, what the fuck happened when you went into the darkening just now? And by-the-way, you sent your man into a shouting fit. I\u2019ve never heard so much profanity bounce around a room before, unless I\u2019d launched it.\u201d Vela glanced between Endelle and Alison then back. She knew something significant had just happened, more than just giving comfort to Alison, but the scorpion queen demanded answers now. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Fully restored, Vela set her attention on Endelle. \u201cThe darkening called me to the Seers Palace. A Third ascender has taken Owen Stannett\u2019s place. I believe he\u2019s the one that held Samuel prisoner all that time, the one called Sharav.\u201d She gave a description of him and Samuel nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s probably him.\u201d Endelle turned to Merl. \u201cDoes that sound right?\u201d He nodded, his brows drawn together.</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d Endelle released a heavy sigh and after a moment addressed Thorne. \u201cI think we have our answer about what happened, and how the three generals knew where and when to attack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeer information.\u201d Thorne, making use of his deep, gravelly voice, released his own stream of profanity. \u201cI should get over there. I\u2019ll take a division if I have to and tear that goddamn place down stone- by-fucking-stone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think that\u2019s a plan,\u201d Endelle said.</p><p>\u201cBut right now, let\u2019s get Duncan out. If this Third asshole also orchestrated Duncan\u2019s capture, then he might decide to speed up the execution.\u201d Thorne nodded briskly several times, turning toward Samuel. \u201cSince you\u2019ve already been inside the grid, I want you to take lead.\u201d All eyes shifted to Samuel. \u201cThe only thing we\u2019re not sure about is how to distract the wreckers so we can attack and get their weapons. We should figure out a way to move in from a flank position, maybe lure a squad of wreckers to us. But how do we trick them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what to do,\u201d Vela interjected. \u201cWhen I was in the darkening, I slipped into Sharav\u2019s head and saw exactly how this would go down, at least the first part of it. Trust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you see?\u201d Samuel scowled.</p><p>Vela switched to telepathy and told him what she\u2019d seen in the vision, of herself, naked on the floor.</p> <p>But Samuel took a step back. \u201cNo,\u201d he shouted. \u201cHell the fuck no.\u201d Vela wasn\u2019t certain what to do or how to convince him this was best, but Endelle laughed and moved in to clap Samuel on the shoulder. \u201cSettle down, warrior. Vela can do this thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t even know what she suggested.\u201d Endelle met Vela\u2019s gaze. \u201cSure I do.</p><p>I dove straight into her mind and saw what you just saw. Nice ass, by the way. You work out much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay on point,\u201d Thorne said.</p><p>Endelle rolled her eyes. \u201cFine.\u201d She addressed Samuel. \u201cVela\u2019s right. The plan will work like a charm. Three men with weapons, coming across a vision like that? So, get over yourself, or the breh- hedden, or whichever monster has control of you right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Leto called out, his deep beast-voice booming through the room. \u201cCan you let us in on this?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cVela\u2019s going to play \u2018butt-naked decoy\u2019. But you boys just be respectful, which I know you will be.\u201d Thorne and Leto exchanged a glance, then turned a boatload of compassion on Samuel.</p><p>\u201cWe know what you\u2019re going through,\u201d Thorne said. \u201cDon\u2019t worry.</p><p>We\u2019ll keep our distance.\u201d Samuel paled as he said, \u201cFine. I guess there\u2019s only one more question to ask and answer: Vela, can you move all of us through the darkening at once? This will be a big group.\u201d Vela glanced at Fiona and Alison, Leto and Thorne. \u201cHell, yeah, I can. And Thorne, you\u2019ll want to be in flight battle gear. And don\u2019t worry, none of you need to be physically connected or anything, not for this trip.\u201d In a blur, Thorne changed.</p><p>Samuel took her hand and squeezed.</p><p>\u201cAre you absolutely sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever more sure in my life.\u201d</p><p>Samuel released his dark power, not surprised that all eyes shifted in his direction as his smoky grayle mist rose around him and his energy flowed, strengthening all that he was as a man and a warrior.</p><p>He knew the latent streams of power were still there, but for now, he was good.</p> <p>He turned to Vela, still holding her hand. The soft answering smile eased him as he dipped his chin. \u201cTake us into the darkening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d She might have blinked, he wasn\u2019t sure, but the next moment, as a group, they sped without walking or running, just a swift form of levitation up one darkening grid tunnel after the next. Vela\u2019s power held them together as a group, on and on, following some kind of internal compass that she possessed.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re close to contact,\u201d Vela called out. \u201cAs soon as the wreckers stop, fold behind them and do what you do best.\u201d Samuel held his sword in his free hand. Vela slowed their joint movement, then brought the group to a halt. In the near distance an explosion sounded.</p><p>She turned to Samuel and said, \u201cHang tough on this one, on what I have to do next.\u201d He tightened down his caveman instincts and nodded.</p><p>To the other men, she said, \u201cYou might want to look away. I\u2019ll signal Samuel, then take care of business. Right now, get down, as low as you can.\u201d Leto and Thorne nodded. \u201cAlison, Fiona, you\u2019ll be safest pressed against the grid wall.\u201d Two more nods.</p><p>She waved her hand and lost her clothes. Samuel watched her speed twenty feet away and stretch out on her side, on the stone floor that matched Duncan\u2019s cell.</p><p>He could hardly recognize the feeling that ripped through him, but again fear and pride split him; a terrible fear that his woman lay, completely vulnerable, this far away from him, and pride that she\u2019d reached beyond her previous convictions, setting them aside, to save another ascender\u2019s life.</p><p>A second explosion, closer this time.</p><p>Alison and Fiona stood right next to the grid wall. He thought about Duncan and as his grayle power flowed, he extended his senses. Duncan was nearby.</p><p>Vela, how we doin\u2019? he sent.</p><p>Duncan\u2019s about thirty yards from here.</p><p>I can sense him now. Samuel\u2019s biceps flexed.</p><p>They\u2019re almost here. Ten, nine, eight... Samuel continued the count so that the other warriors could hear. \u201cSeven, six, five, four...\u201d Leto and Thorne both leaned forward. \u201cThree, two...\u201d A grid wall exploded not five feet from Vela, but she didn\u2019t budge, not even a hair\u2019s breadth. Wall debris, like black ash from a fire, blanketed the area and three wreckers broke through, three massive Third Earth Warriors, in kilted flight battle gear, shotguns over shoulders.</p><p>Big motherfuckers.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is this?\u201d The leader stared down at Vela. Like the description of Sharav, he wore three braids on either side of his face, clipped back in low hanging loops. All the men had long hair, Warrior of the Blood long.</p><p>\u201cSomething stinks here.\u201d The wrecker on the left backed away from Vela. \u201cI say we waste her and get the hell out of this tunnel.\u201d Samuel gave the signal, a forward slice of his arm in Vela\u2019s direction.</p><p>And just as the wreckers lifted their heads to look down the tunnel, Samuel folded. He reappeared, at the same time as Thorne and Leto, behind the men.</p><p>Samuel sliced across his adversary\u2019s forearm, striking almost to the bone so that the wrecker\u2019s shotgun fell to the floor. But a second later, the bastard turned to face him, a sword in his other hand, as though he\u2019d barely felt the wound. He topped Samuel by at least two inches, and his skills matched the Warriors of the Blood.</p><p>Samuel bumped up his grayle power, adding new streams of the dark mist, which brought his opponent\u2019s eyebrows up a couple of notches.</p><p>\u201cSurprise.\u201d Game on and never had a sword felt so good in his hand, or his new power so magnificent as in this moment when he battled the bastard who had said, \u2018Let\u2019s waste her.\u2019 Both Leto and Thorne had taken on a wrecker and a sword-fight ensued so that the sound of metal against metal echoed up and down the tunnel. Because the element of surprise had worn off, it was just vampire-against-vampire.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>The moment the explosion had sounded, Vela had leaped to her feet, waved a hand and got dressed. She hurried back to join Alison and Fiona. She watched in awe as Fiona allowed Alison to access her body, to essentially take her over so that Fiona\u2019s obsidian flame power could amplify Alison\u2019s ability to reconfigure weapon identification. In the process, Alison\u2019s body grew lax against the darkening grid wall, present-but-not- present.</p><p>Fiona gave herself a shake. When she moved, she even brushed her hair away from her face like Alison would have done.</p><p>As the battle raged, Fiona turned in the direction of the three weapons that had slid toward them on the floor.</p><p>Vela caught her hand, holding her back. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d She turned to Vela and touched her forehead. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I can do this.\u201d Alison again, speaking from Fiona\u2019s lips and staring at Vela from Fiona\u2019s silvery- blue eyes. \u201cI\u2019m going to start working these weapons now. And I can feel it in every cell of my body that I can do this.\u201d Fiona, now Alison, moved swiftly in the direction of the battle, heading toward the nearest weapon.</p><p>Vela held her breath as Fiona stretched out her hand. The weapon flew toward her.</p><p>\u201cPlease work, please work, please work,\u201d Vela murmured.</p><p>Beyond, the men battled.</p><p>The weapon reached Fiona\u2019s hand and even at this distance, Vela felt an electric current pass up and down the tunnel. Fiona held up the weapon. \u201cOne down,\u201d she called out.</p><p>Vela let go of a huge sigh of relief.</p><p>At almost the same moment, one of the wreckers fell to the stone floor and Thorne took his head.</p><p>Vela wanted to look away, but couldn\u2019t. She\u2019d never seen a battle close up before, not like this. The one she\u2019d witnessed at the Superstitions had still been at a greater distance and within the safety of the darkening.</p><p>Thorne turned in Leto\u2019s direction, and in a blinding move, folded, reappeared behind the second wrecker and shoved a dagger into his lower back.</p><p>As the Third Warrior arched at the sudden unexpected pain, Leto drove his sword through his chest. When he withdrew the blade, the wrecker also toppled to the floor.</p><p>Leto removed his head.</p><p>Thorne turned, extended his hand in Fiona\u2019s direction. She didn\u2019t hesitate but tossed the reconfigured shotgun to him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She repeated the process twice more, rendering each weapon harmless. Leto ran toward her and took one of the shotguns from her. He then moved back to Alison\u2019s uninhabited body and stood guard.</p><p>All the while, Leto battled the wrecker, who had also released his grayle power, so that two plumes of mist, one dark and smoky, the other gray and almost green-tinged, flowed in strange whirls above the warriors, moving in a strange counter-dance.</p><p>Thorne stood off to the side, shotgun in hand, looking for an opportunity, his eyes intent on the battle.</p><p>Vela watched mesmerized as both warriors battled in an incomprehensible blur of levitation and folding.</p> <p>Fiona returned to stand close to Alison and, like watching a sliding door part swiftly, the women disconnected and became themselves. Both remained silent as the final battle progressed.</p><p>Vela\u2019s heart swelled at the sight of Samuel keeping pace with the Third Warrior.</p><p>\u201cLook at him move,\u201d Alison whispered. \u201cMy God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Fiona breathed raggedly, her arms now crossed over her chest.</p><p>Then she felt it, another vibration through the grid. \u201cMore wreckers.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShit,\u201d Leto muttered. \u201cAt least we have the weapons.\u201d A distant explosion sounded.</p><p>They had to get this job done and get out of there. They were running out of time.</p><p>She had to do something. She focused on Samuel, and without giving it too much thought, she entered Samuel\u2019s mind which whirred with movement, just as he moved.</p><p>She relaxed and sent him her power, a soft stream of energy.</p><p>What followed was a kind of explosive response in Samuel as he whirled in the air, just as the wrecker whirled, but did a lateral whipping movement, took his opponent out at the knees.</p><p>Thorne moved in, and took his head.</p> <p>The battle was over.</p><p>Vela called out. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get to get Duncan. Now!\u201d The men started running in her direction. She gathered her darkening ability, swept up the group and carried them swiftly, not backward, but onward, straight to Duncan\u2019s cell. The darkening allowed her to see inside, where two workers were cutting an unconscious warrior down.</p><p>\u201cMen, use those damn weapons and let\u2019s get Duncan now. Here.\u201d She patted the wall. Another distant explosion sounded. \u201cWe\u2019ve got about twenty seconds.\u201d Samuel approached the wall, lifted his weapon and fired, which sent him backward on his ass, but the wall disintegrated. Thorne and Leto launched inside, pushed the slaves away, grabbed Duncan then hauled him back into the darkening. He was still bound by ropes and bled from one end of his body to the next.</p><p>Just as an explosion took out the wall opposite, Vela sped the group down tunnel after tunnel, faster and faster. She could feel Duncan\u2019s life force ebb. The warrior was almost gone. Forget the execution, he\u2019d been beaten and sliced to the absolute rim of death.</p><p>She heard explosions following her, but she also knew what she could do.</p><p>The next moment, she brought her team through their initial entry point and planted her hands on the wall to create the seal. Damn, shotguns exploded beyond the wall. She felt a terrible vibration. \u201cI can\u2019t hold it,\u201d she called out.</p><p>Merl stepped in and planted his hands on the wall. His Third Earth mist rose and power flooded the room like nothing she\u2019d ever known. Together, they sealed up the wall.</p><p>Then silence.</p> <p>\u201cAre we safe?\u201d Endelle asked.</p><p>\u201cJesus H. Christ. Are we safe?\u201d Vela turned to her. \u201cYes.\u201d She eased away from the wall.</p><p>Endelle looked at Duncan\u2019s unconscious form and called out sharply.</p><p>\u201cJeannie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Madame Endelle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet Horace over here to the palace.</p><p>No, faster than that. I want him at my position.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDone.\u201d Five seconds later, Horace appeared next to Endelle. He dropped beside Duncan, but addressed Fiona. \u201cI\u2019m going to need you.\u201d The woman didn\u2019t skip a beat. Vela watched as she repeated her drawing-in process, so that Horace\u2019s power took her over and she went to work on Duncan.</p><p>The moment Fiona put her hand on Duncan\u2019s chest, he jerked once, then drew breath.</p><p>Tears sprang to Vela\u2019s eyes.</p><p>They\u2019d caught him just in time.</p><p>Duncan had almost died.</p><p>Samuel slid an arm around her waist.</p><p>He was sweaty from battle, and the leather harness had stiff edges, but it was the best feel in the world as he drew her against him.</p><p>You did good , his words a thrill through her mind.</p><p>She\u2019d never been in a battle before and for a first one, yes she\u2019d done good.</p><p>Her heart swelled as she wiped away tears that kept falling.</p><p>Duncan began to heal, faster than anything she\u2019d seen before, but after a minute, Fiona sat back and separated from Horace.</p><p>She looked exhausted.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got it now,\u201d Horace said. \u201cGo home and get some rest.\u201d He smiled tenderly at her.</p><p>Fiona nodded. The couple hadn\u2019t made a formal announcement, but rumor had it she was pregnant. She turned to Madame Endelle. \u201cPermission to leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGranted. Jeannie, send Fiona home straight from here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, Madame Endelle.\u201d Fiona simply vanished.</p><p>Alison crossed to Vela. \u201cYou did an amazing thing tonight and showed so much courage. Well done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I could stay, but I have a flying toddler at home who will be up at the crack of dawn.\u201d Endelle once more barked at Jeannie and Alison disappeared.</p><p>Both Leto and Thorne stood on either side of Duncan, who was still unconscious. Horace, his hands moving from wound to wound and performing his healing magic, glanced up at Thorne.</p><p>\u201cThis will take some time and he should have rest. I\u2019d like to move him to the hospital but not by fold. Some of these cuts are deep and grazed his organs. He would have died if you hadn\u2019t gotten to him.\u201d Vela\u2019s throat tightened and Samuel rubbed his hand up and down her side and waist. We got him.</p><p>We did.</p><p>He saved me, Samuel added.</p><p>And now you returned the favor.</p><p>We saved him, all of us and my part was the damned least I could do.</p><p>By the time Horace had a still unconscious Duncan packed up in an ambulance for the drive to the hospital, Leto had returned to the Gateway to Third Earth.</p><p>Thorne took all three sawed off shotguns, intending to have his firearms expert work with them to see what shells were used and how the wreckers added their power to enhance the shot. Scowling, he muttered something about practicing with them at the Illinois Seers Palace, as he headed back in the direction of the Command Center.</p><p>Vela addressed Merl. \u201cWhat would have happened if you hadn\u2019t been here to finish seal up the Gateway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweet fucking Christ,\u201d Endelle muttered.</p><p>\u201cIs there anything I can do to strengthen my own power to seal up the breach?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so. You\u2019re pretty amazing.\u201d Vela glanced at him, stunned that not a single flirtatious lilt attached to his words, Even Samuel remained settled beside her.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cThank you for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that settles something for me,\u201d Endelle said. \u201cFor the time being, the two of you stay with Merl. And stay in contact.\u201d She turned to Merl. \u201cI\u2019ll need you to work with Vela to get this skill up to par because I\u2019m guessing we haven\u2019t seen the last of the grid wreckers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you okay with this, Third ascender?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, yeah. Least I can do for the Supreme High Administrator of Second Earth.\u201d His nostrils flared. \u201cYou know, I don\u2019t have to go home right away.\u201d Endelle chortled. \u201cYou\u2019ve got balls, I\u2019ll give you that. And I\u2019m tempted because everything about you says you\u2019ve got the right equipment and know how to use it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn straight about that.\u201d Vela stepped a little closer to Samuel. She could almost see the sparks flying from one ascender to the other.</p><p>The heat in this room, Samuel sent in what felt like the quietest telepathic voice he could manage, could melt a glacier.</p><p>I know what you mean.</p><p>But I thought Endelle had hooked up with Braulio? Samuel scowled like he somehow disapproved.</p><p>Vela squeezed his hand. That\u2019s just it. He hasn\u2019t been around for the last month and she has no way to contact him.</p><p>Gotta be a bitch.</p><p>Exactly.</p><p>Well, Braulio had better get his ass back here because that\u2019s one determined vampire.</p><p>No kidding.</p><p>Finally, after a long half minute of staring at Merl, and maybe debating the offer, Endelle said, \u201cThanks, but I\u2019m sort of in a relationship.\u201d For a reason she couldn\u2019t explain, Vela released a sigh of relief.</p><p>But Merl actually moved until just a spare few inches separated him from Endelle. \u201cWell, you let me know if your boyfriend stops hiding out in another dimension. I\u2019d love to spend some time taking care of you.\u201d Vela broke a sweat and it wasn\u2019t helping that Samuel now rubbed his thumb in circles over the palm of her hand. She\u2019d never quite understood why the gesture was so damn sexual but it was working.</p><p>That, and his smoky, chocolate scent had started flowing in her direction.</p><p>Those flowers of yours are getting to me.</p><p>I want to be alone with you.</p><p>He released a soft growl.</p><p>Merl glanced at Samuel. \u201cI\u2019m going to stay here and check out Thorne\u2019s operation, maybe see if I can help. Why don\u2019t you two head back to my house. And just so you know, after I leave here, I\u2019ll be heading out to a couple of clubs and I won\u2019t be back until dawn.\u201d Vela almost said something in response, but Samuel called out, \u201cSounds like a plan.\u201d By then he had hold of her hand and urged her in the direction of the doorway. She took to the idea right away and started walking faster.</p><p>His smile expanded by the time they reached the landing platform, a very male, satisfied response to what he knew would soon happen between them.</p><p>By then, Vela wore her own smile, so she could hardly complain.</p><p>\u201cI need a shower,\u201d Samuel said, almost trembling with his need to get Vela underneath him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHere\u2019s an idea. How about I join you?\u201d He groaned then hauled her into his arms. A weapons harness, stiff by nature, wasn\u2019t the most comfortable piece of clothing to press up against a woman, but Vela didn\u2019t seem to care.</p><p>He folded it off anyway, even while he held her in his arms. Vela landed against his chest and that\u2019s when things got a little crazy as she slung her arms around his neck and her legs around his waist.</p><p>With his tongue deep in her mouth, he tried to walk her backwards and finally ended up just folding her to the bathroom.</p> <p>She let go of him, dropping her feet to the floor, but her eyes had a dazed look and when she waved a hand to get rid of her clothes, her jeans ended up around her ankles. She would have toppled over, but he caught her.</p><p>\u201cAllow me.\u201d He dropped to his knees, lifted a bare foot, slid the pants off the old-fashioned way, then the other.</p><p>He kissed the inside of her right ankle and being the smart woman that she was, she shifted her feet farther apart to increase the room he had to work as he began kissing his way up her leg.</p><p>Soft moans flowed down on his head, then little whimpers. He added bites and sucks, one after the other, moving ever upward. He was just about to get busy when Vela said, \u201cSamuel, I really like what you\u2019re doing, but I\u2019ve got this funny feeling about something.\u201d He squeezed his eyes shut for a long moment. He so didn\u2019t want her called back into the darkening, not right now.</p><p>He looked up at her. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d She stepped away from him. \u201cWhat do you think is on the other side of that door? I mean, the guest room has a closet, and the toilet\u2019s on the opposite side of this room. So...\u201d She let the word hang.</p> <p>He lifted his head and saw that an archway, centered in the wall well beyond the massive shower, led to a door. \u201cIt can\u2019t be Merl\u2019s bedroom.\u201d Vela met his gaze. \u201cKnowing Merl, I think I know what it is and that\u2019s exactly where I want to be right now.\u201d She left him kneeling, wondering if he\u2019d lost his touch, then he got it, which of course launched him to his feet. By the time she shoved the door open, he fit right up against her back, one hand on her hip, as he crossed the threshold with her.</p><p>\u201cOh, my God,\u201d she said, \u201cthis is the most decadent room I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d He couldn\u2019t have agreed more. The lights had come on the moment Vela opened the door, mood-lighting, with a rim of pot-lights glowing in a soft teal all round the perimeter. A dark sensuality permeated what was a very private room.</p><p>Directly across from the door, a screen dominated the entire wall, featuring the portrait of a couple from the waist up, naked, and in a tight embrace, the man kissing her neck. He glanced to his right and saw a video camera and some controls. So the screen could also be used to project images, maybe to play a movie.</p><p>His gaze drifted to the center of the room. One large overhead pot light lit up an apparatus he\u2019d always wanted to try out, a tall, leather, bench-like mount, over which the woman would recline face down. And if Vela was game, he\u2019d love to do this with her because the room served one purpose: to allow for wing- mount while making love.</p><p>His erection punched at his kilt, which reminded him that he\u2019d only partially undressed.</p><p>She turned to him, her eyes dilated, her scent perfuming the air. \u201cThe mount has leather straps at the top. I could really hold on, keep my balance. Samuel, I want to do this. Are you game?\u201d He shoved the door shut with his foot and while kissing her again, and almost tripping over her as he moved her in the direction of the mount, he sent, More than game. We\u2019ll both be able to let our wings fly.</p> <p>I know, I know. Now lose the rest of your clothes, warrior.</p><p>He drew back from her and laughed.</p><p>He waved a hand and got rid of his kilt, briefs, battle sandals and shin guards. He meant to kiss her again, but she planted her hands on his pecs, fondling him with just her thumbs. \u201cHey, you were magnificent in the darkening. I mean it.</p><p>The way you fought, your speed, that you could fold like that and levitate and all the while your mist flowed around you in the most elegant streamers.</p><p>I was mesmerized.\u201d Her words heated his mind and electrified his body, making his muscles pop in some kind of remembered action of the battle itself. \u201cI kept thinking about you, Vela, about finishing the fight so that I could get back to you. I wanted you safe.\u201d Her hands slid down his chest and around his back. \u201cI am safe, so thank you for that, for getting us through.\u201d He smiled. \u201cI wasn\u2019t the only one there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But you\u2019re here and I\u2019m thanking you.\u201d He kissed her, more intensely this time, because he knew she admired him, thought well of him, and had approved his part in Duncan\u2019s rescue. As he slid his tongue into her mouth, she suckled, which forced a groan from his throat.</p><p>Her hands moved slowly from wing- lock to wing-lock, her fingers kneading the length of each lock then teasing the apertures. He wept for her so that as she moved, the lubricant that allowed for wing-release spread over his back.</p><p>By now, he arched over her, pushing his cock against her, savoring that her hips pushed back. Let\u2019s try out that mount, he sent.</p> <p>But as he released her, she said, \u201cI want you to lie down first, on your stomach. I need to suck down some of those juices.\u201d Okay, he almost came because her choice of words were as erotic as what she wanted to do to him. He didn\u2019t argue with her either but stretched himself out on the mount.</p><p>\u201cSpread your legs a little more.\u201d He smiled and a thrill shot down his testicles. Her hands were on him first, but not touching his wing-locks. Instead, she fondled him low. \u201cYou have a beautiful ass,\u201d she said. Then she was stroking his buttocks, kissing and licking. When she dipped low and licked and plucked at his perineum then his balls, he emitted a sound that fell somewhere between an anguished groan and a grunt.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better stop,\u201d he called out.</p><p>\u201cOr I won\u2019t last.\u201d She chuckled. \u201cWell, we can\u2019t have that.\u201d He felt her move in close to him from behind, lean over and that\u2019s when more of the magic happened as she got busy with his wing-locks. She started at the upper right and he closed his eyes and savored.</p><p>She sucked at the tip, moaning, her hips pumping into him in the nicest way.</p><p>He decided then and there that he needed to add onto his house. He had to have a room like this, one where he could be with Vela as often as he liked, maybe everyday for a good long stretch.</p><p>As she sucked on his wing-locks, the thought of having her with him always worked on his mind and on his heart. What was happening to him? What was the breh-hedden doing to him?</p><p>He seemed to be falling for her, straight off a cliff, tumbling over and over.</p><p>But that made no sense in his solitary life, the one he lived, a wolf\u2019s life, functioning with his Militia Warrior pack, but moving at the edges of society, never fully engaged.</p><p>Whatever this was, he\u2019d reached a point where he wanted to be inside her, to bury himself, to feel that connection to her.</p><p>I need you, he sent. He lifted up and she drew back at the same time. He turned toward her and kissed her again, his erection pressing against her, his hips angling, seeking.</p><p>Let me get prone, Samuel. God, I need you inside me, too. Now. My wing- locks are screaming because they know I\u2019m going to release.</p><p>Mine, too.</p><p>He let her go and she whirled to lie face down. \u201cOh, this is heaven because your scent is all over the leather.\u201d She took a deep breath and groaned.</p><p>\u201cIncredible.\u201d She took hold of the straps.</p><p>He split the mass of her blond hair, pushing it away from her back to hang down on either side of her. He loved the sight of her beautiful back, glistening from her wing-locks doing what they do, swelling, moistening, getting ready to mount. Even looking at the swollen ridges worked his cock.</p><p>She spread her legs and he had to have a good look at her beautiful bareness, her swollen lips and folds, that she also glistened below.</p><p>He dropped to his knees, needing to have a taste and the moment his tongue connected she cried out. He gripped her hips, wanting her to come just once before he pierced her.</p><p>He drove his tongue hard, her sweet floral flavor another tantalizing sensation that kept him hard and ready. Come for me, Vela, just once before we mount.</p><p>Somehow his voice in her head must have done the trick because she cried out, her hips pumping against the mount, writhing as he rode her orgasm to the end.</p><p>When she lay slack, he rose up and stroked her buttocks, just as she\u2019d touched and fondled him. He went upward, massaging her waist. But when he reached her wing-locks, he sucked on the lowest one, which brought a new moan out of her mouth.</p><p>You ready for a wing-release? he asked.</p><p>Yes. I\u2019m so ready. And I want you, Samuel, all of you, as deep as you can get.</p><p>He lifted up and using his hand, guided his cock into her waiting body, pressing slowly to get positioned.</p><p>When he was in, he began to thrust, watching as she used the straps, one in each hand, to counter his moves, which created the best friction.</p><p>She breathed roughly against the mount. \u201cI won\u2019t last long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, neither.\u201d He\u2019d barely been able to get the words out. Being inside her, with her scent rich in his nostrils, her wetness easing every stroke, all of it worked his wing-locks. They were swollen now and pleasure flowed in waves over his body and plucked at his balls.</p><p>She panted as he gripped her hips to gain the balance he needed. He pumped faster and he felt her tighten around his cock.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to come.\u201d Her body arched and he watched as her wings began to fly from the locks. She clenched around him hard and screamed her pleasure.</p><p>The sounds she made, coupled with the sight of her wing-release, brought his release. He roared as the sensations combined to flood his body with pleasure.</p><p>His cock jerked with each pump of fluid, the feel of his wings streaking through and pleasuring each of his locks so that he writhed as he drove into her. The flesh of her hips in his hands drove him to an ecstasy that kept delivering, jolts of sensation that flowed upward through his abdomen and forced guttural shouts from his throat. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>On the climax moved, like nothing he\u2019d known before, his wings flapping in strong downward sweeps even as Vela\u2019s moved, even as she kept crying out. Her hands pulled hard on the straps, keeping them both anchored.</p><p>Pleasure on pleasure.</p><p>Cresting more than once.</p> <p>Finally, the last wave rose and fell to a gentle easing down. He breathed hard, Vela as well, her arms now hanging loosely down the sides of the leather mount, her thick blond hair draped on either side of her head.</p><p>\u201cI want one of these,\u201d she said, chuckling.</p><p>He smiled and placed his hand on the center of her back, touching her between her wings. \u201cYour wings are extraordinary.</p><p>And gray, with a darker gray banding at the tips. They\u2019re beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike your eyes, Samuel,\u201d she said softly. \u201cLike your eyes.\u201d She craned her neck to look back at him. \u201cAnd your wings are an incredible shade of blue.\u201d She lowered her head, looking peaceful and relaxed. \u201cDo you think that means something, that our wings reflect each other\u2019s eye color?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Her wings could have been polka-dotted, in bright yellow and purple, and he wouldn\u2019t have cared.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m content more than I can say being connected to you like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what you mean.\u201d She flapped her wings gently then released a deep sigh. \u201cI do know what I want right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo curl up beside you in bed and sleep for about a decade.\u201d He smiled. Nothing could have sounded better. \u201cBut I\u2019d still like that shower.\u201d</p><p>After spending the rest of the night and a good part of the day asleep, Vela awoke cradled in Samuel\u2019s arms, facing him. She kept sighing, her contentment boundless. Earlier, around dawn, Samuel had awakened her gently then made love to her, bringing her to another roaring climax, which she was pretty sure Merl must have heard since both she and Samuel had cried out repeatedly.</p> <p>If Merl had even come home last night.</p><p>Merl was one of those big unknowns, living almost hedonistically as a refugee from what sounded like a messed up dimension. But Merl wasn\u2019t her problem right now, and hopefully never would be.</p><p>He had his own path just as she had hers.</p><p>She lay beside Samuel, her head on his shoulder. She kept fondling the incredible curves of his pecs, the dip below his sternum, the rolling landscape of his abs. \u201cI still want to work as a counselor, no matter what this new power means.\u201d To her surprise, Samuel chuckled.</p><p>\u201cWhy? It seems to me you have a whole new path laid out for you.\u201d She hadn\u2019t expected to hear something like that from him. She leaned back and met his gaze. \u201cBut, why wouldn\u2019t I still want to counsel those unfortunate women? I\u2019ve been studying psychology for years and I\u2019ve had a lot of counseling myself. I think I could do some good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoing good isn\u2019t the point. You\u2019re not built for it.\u201d She didn\u2019t like the direction of this exchange, but she pressed on. \u201cI think you\u2019re wrong and given what happened at the palace, when I was able to give Alison some peace, this new power I\u2019m experiencing might just take my counseling to a new level. In which case, I could be of even more use.\u201d He frowned slightly. \u201cRemind me again what you did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI placed my hand on her forehead. I comforted Alison. The Alison Wells. I felt her empathic power flow through me and into her, easing her. And that\u2019s one reason I think you\u2019re wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to pick a fight this morning. It\u2019s just that I\u2019ve been inside your mind and I saw how much you loved traveling and living a more adventurous life. That\u2019s all. I think you might want to open yourself up to, I don\u2019t know, a calling that might have more meaning and purpose for you personally.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLike what? Like serving as a Militia Warrior?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say that. In fact, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re a warrior. But this gift has to mean something, has to mean more than you think it does. Have you considered the possibility that the attack in 1922 affected you in a way that shut down your adventurous spirit, or did you already deal with that in counseling?\u201d Vela couldn\u2019t quite meet his gaze because her conscience prickled her.</p><p>During her sessions, she\u2019d repeatedly glossed over the subject, afraid to plumb the depths of what had happened to her the night Jeff and his squad rescued her. \u201cYou may be right,\u201d she said quietly. She then glanced at him and frowned. \u201cBut what of you, Samuel?\u201d He drew his arm from around her and crossed his arms to rest on top of his head.</p><p>\u201cWhat about me? I think I\u2019m doing all right.\u201d With that one move, she knew she had a choice to make. If she pressed on, the argument would escalate. But his strident opinions of how she should best live her life rankled. And hey, turnabout was fair play, so she said, \u201cI think you should become a Warrior of the Blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he all but shouted, drawing his brow into a neat line of ridges. \u201cYou think I should become a What-Bee? Based on what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn seeing you battle beside Thorne, you know, the Supreme High Commander of the Allied Forces, and Warrior Leto in his beast-state? You\u2019re their equal. Hell, you might even exceed them, Samuel.</p><p>What do you think of that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy being equal in power has nothing to do with it. I\u2019m a Militia Warrior. Even Gideon, after the breh- hedden took him down and his powers increased, didn\u2019t join up. I belong to the Thunder God Warriors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Gideon has a different set of responsibilities. He\u2019s Colonel Seriffe\u2019s second-in-command. And you\u2019re just a fighter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a back-up Section Leader. I have responsibilities.\u201d But his frown deepened.</p><p>\u201cOh, I know what it is. I get it.\u201d He leaned up on his elbow, turning slightly to face her, anger flashing in his eyes. \u201cWhat do you get?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI may not have dived into your mind, but I understand something about you. The Warriors of the Blood are a tight group, really tight, connected, and that\u2019s not something you do. Ever.\u201d She even punched her forefinger into his chest for emphasis.</p><p>He narrowed his gaze, a smile suddenly playing at his lips. \u201cOh, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve connected pretty well with you.\u201d Since he shed his bitter chocolate scent, and her body responded, she leaned in and kissed him. Samuel had full, sensual lips and he knew how to work his tongue. For a few seconds, she even considered drawing him back down on top of her and encouraging him to take her again.</p><p>But she had a point she wanted to make, so she responded, \u201cThen let me mind-dive with you.\u201d He snorted. \u201cYou want me to prove that I can connect by allowing you inside my head? No. And I\u2019ve already told you why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean those elusive streams of energy that haven\u2019t yet made an appearance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you saying you don\u2019t believe I have them?\u201d A knock on the door had Samuel moving quickly, dragging the comforter up to her chin, making sure she was covered.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, Merl?\u201d Their host opened the door slightly and called out, \u201cEndelle wants to make sure we get some practice in on sealing up the grid wall. Given all that happened last night, we should get going on that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Give us twenty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood deal.\u201d When Merl pulled the door shut, Samuel rolled out of bed. \u201cI call the shower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not done discussing this.\u201d He just waved to her as he went into the bathroom and shut the door.</p><p>Showered, with a fresh change of clothes brought over from his Scottsdale Two home, Samuel sat next to Vela at the kitchen island, fork and knife in hand.</p><p>Merl, standing opposite, near the sink, kept going on and on about Thorne\u2019s recent exploits, something he and Vela had missed since they\u2019d been asleep through the morning.</p><p>Vela nodded to Merl. \u201cSo Thorne really tore the Illinois Two Seers Palace apart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Found it abandoned, except for the Seers. He had several Militia Warriors practicing with the wrecker shotguns, which work even better outside the darkening. I hear it\u2019ll be nothing but rubble soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell thank the Creator for that. And what about the Seers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBest part of the whole damn story.</p><p>He sent fifty-five drugged out women to Fiona\u2019s rehab center.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFifty-five? That man is incredible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, he is.\u201d Samuel groaned and snorted at the same time. He admired Thorne. Who the hell didn\u2019t? But what he fucking resented was Merl using the news of Thorne\u2019s exploits to impress his woman.</p><p>He focused on the steak and eggs that Vela had prepared for them, and yes, the woman could cook. She\u2019d brought food over from her house again and even made some kind of salsa with chunks of fruit in it, mango maybe.</p><p>Since it was already after five and heading toward sundown, Samuel wished he had a beer. Of course that wasn\u2019t the best way to start a night when he had a new skill-set to learn, if he could even help with the sealing of grid walls.</p><p>He glanced at Vela, thinking about what she\u2019d said earlier, about wanting to mind-dive, that maybe his real issue was one about connection.</p><p>While Merl and Vela chatted away, he cut another slice of steak, piled on the egg, and the salsa, and shoved it in his mouth. He stared at the light granite of the island and chewed slowly.</p><p>His life had always been pretty simple. His mother had died when he was very young and his father had been, clear up until the day of his death, a sonofabitch who drank too much.</p><p>Samuel had lived a man\u2019s life, a harsh life. That\u2019s all he\u2019d ever known.</p><p>Even the torture he\u2019d endured had been part of living his warrior\u2019s life. In many ways, that was his job. He was a Militia Warrior; warring, tough, and yes, maybe somewhat disconnected. He loved to fuck women, but he never let anyone in. Maybe he didn\u2019t know how, but like hell he\u2019d put Vela through the trauma of seeing what he\u2019d been through by engaging in something like mind-diving.</p><p>He was also concerned for her physical safety. For the most part he had control of his dark power, but he still didn\u2019t know what might cause an event like the one that had killed those innocent workers. And he didn\u2019t want to find out, especially not when Vela shared his bed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He glanced at her, his heart swelling at the sight of her lovely profile, her mass of hair pushed behind her shoulders, flowing in waves and curls, away from her plate. She was a beautiful woman, over two-hundred-years-old. Ascended life broke the bonds of Mortal Earth so that here he sat, falling in love with a woman over twice his age.</p><p>She wore jeans again, a great look for her long legs. Her peach-colored blouse, nipped in at the waist, had a row of buttons down the middle that he\u2019d like to unbutton one at a time. He\u2019d caught a glimpse of her low-cut sheer bra and had almost kept her in the bedroom with him for an additional twenty minutes.</p><p>With some effort, he\u2019d restrained himself.</p> <p>And if he kept looking and thinking about what was under her clothes, he\u2019d be in trouble all over again.</p><p>He focused on his meal, and every once in a while, joined in the conversation but mostly Merl liked talking, so he talked.</p><p>When at last, their host rounded the island and called for plates, Samuel slid his in Merl\u2019s direction, who performed dishwasher duty.</p><p>He glanced at each of them in turn.</p><p>\u201cYou two ready to see if you can seal a darkening grid wall together?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCan\u2019t wait.\u201d Vela smiled broadly then turned toward Samuel.</p><p>He still thought he was right about her, that she\u2019d gotten spooked after that terrifying death vampire attack so long ago, and had reined in her life way too far.</p><p>Even seeing her present excitement proved his point.</p><p>\u201cAll right, where do you want to do this?\u201d Samuel looked around the kitchen then at the window with a view of the sunlit forest on the opposite mountainside.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking we should leave the Phoenix Metro area.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was my thought,\u201d Merl said.</p> <p>Vela looked from one to the other.</p><p>\u201cRight. In case we end up summoning wreckers accidentally, they won\u2019t land in Merl\u2019s living room again.\u201d For the next hour, Merl took them to various places around Second Earth, opening the grid then trying to seal it up, and only letting the approach of wreckers end their efforts.</p><p>Bottom line, Vela didn\u2019t always have enough power to seal the grid by herself.</p><p>She could do it maybe fifty percent of the time and when Samuel tried to join her, they became oil and water and the effort failed.</p><p>Later, back at Merl\u2019s house, Samuel paced the living room. \u201cThe problem is that I don\u2019t have the darkening ability. I can\u2019t even see the grid wall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you have Third Earth power,\u201d Merl said. \u201cAnd you have a connection to the darkening or you wouldn\u2019t be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not so sure. I know I have a connection to Vela, but not necessarily to the darkening.\u201d For some reason those words made her smile and he gave her a smile right back. Damn he liked her. No, he loved her, as much as he was able, he loved her.</p><p>He\u2019d been inside her mind, and knew her better than most of his friends, and he valued all that he knew her to be. In this short time he\u2019d been with her, he\u2019d fallen in love, maybe for the first time in his fucked up life.</p> <p>She came to him, and this time when he opened his arms he didn\u2019t hold back, he just let his feelings flow.</p><p>This feels good, she sent.</p><p>Yeah, it does. I never thought I\u2019d say this, but I\u2019m glad the breh-hedden came to us.</p><p>I know. Me, too. She lifted her head to look up at him. I didn\u2019t mean to pick at you earlier. I think you might be right about me and I wasn\u2019t happy about that.</p><p>Me, too.</p><p>She nodded briskly, leaned up and kissed him. Could a man ask for more?</p><p>If Merl hadn\u2019t been present, he would have returned the favor and made her feel that kiss to her toes.</p><p>As it was, Merl cleared his throat.</p><p>\u201cCan we get on with this?\u201d Vela drew back. \u201cYes, sorry Merl.</p><p>Just working some stuff out.\u201d She blinked several times and listed on her feet.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Samuel caught her arm and balanced her.</p><p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s in trouble. It feels just like the last time, when Duncan called for me. Samuel, I have to go. This is why I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust wait a second. Let\u2019s get some back-up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you hear her? My God the woman\u2019s screaming like she\u2019s in pain.\u201d But Samuel\u2019s instincts didn\u2019t mesh right now with Vela\u2019s. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t feel right to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow would you know? You\u2019ve already said this isn\u2019t your gift.\u201d He almost suggested she do a quick mind-dive and see what it was his instincts were telling him, but he shut that thought down fast. \u201cFine. Let\u2019s check it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll move us along as fast as I can and when we reach her, hopefully we can bring her back with us.\u201d She glanced at Merl. \u201cCan you sit tight?\u201d Merl held his hands palms up. \u201cOf course, but are you sure you don\u2019t want to call in Leto at least?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMerl, if we\u2019d arrived two minutes later, Duncan would have died. Period.</p><p>When the darkening calls, I have to go.\u201d She held out her hand to Samuel and he took it, but added, \u201cLet me get armed.\u201d She nodded. \u201cOf course.\u201d He held out his free hand and drew his sword into his palm, a comfortable, solid, familiar weight, the identified grip like coming home. He\u2019d battled a Third Earth wrecker not too many hours ago; he could do it again. If he thought about a squad of three, he shunted the image away.</p><p>He just wished he had one of those shotguns in hand, though he\u2019d agreed with Thorne about getting them looked over before any of them attempted to fire one again in the darkening.</p><p>Besides, with Vela\u2019s speed, he felt confident they could get into the darkening, take care of business, and get back before the wreckers arrived.</p><p>As before, Vela levitated them at astonishing speeds through tunnel after tunnel, but the farther they traveled from the entry point, the more sharply his warning bells rang in his head especially the moment they crossed through the dimension into Third.</p><p>Vela, something\u2019s wrong. This place feels way too familiar. We need to get out of here.</p><p>I can\u2019t leave. The woman\u2019s screams are ringing in my head.</p><p>I can hear her, too, but I think it\u2019s a trap.</p><p>We\u2019re almost there.</p><p>One more tunnel and Vela stopped them just in front of a woman bound in familiar ropes, kneeling on the stone floor of the darkening space.</p><p>The stone floor.</p><p>Same floor as Duncan\u2019s prison cell.</p><p>A split-second later, five ascenders appeared in front of them and the woman fell silent, staring at up at them, a hard glint in her dark eyes.</p><p>Vela turned, not in shock, but in determination. She started to pull Samuel back through the darkening, but two squads of wrecking crews arrived, shotguns in hand, cutting off their escape.</p><p>Behind them, a very familiar Third ascender appeared, stroking his black goatee.</p><p>\u201cWelcome back, Samuel. Did you enjoy your year of freedom?\u201d He spread his hands wide, \u201cIt took some doing, some careful manipulation, but here you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou motherfucker,\u201d Samuel shouted, raising his sword.</p><p>\u201cBut he took the butt of a shotgun to the back of his head, felt the added jolt of preternatural power, and flew face forward at his torturer\u2019s feet.</p><p>The last thing he heard was Sharav saying, \u201cDon\u2019t touch the sword, you idiot; it\u2019s identified.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>Vela stared down at Samuel, now laid out on the stone floor, unconscious.</p><p>This couldn\u2019t be happening.</p><p>\u201cLook at all that blond hair,\u201d the woman said. \u201cCan\u2019t be a warrior. Not this one. Way too girlie.\u201d Vela pivoted and watched the decoy rise to her feet, a very powerful looking woman who touched the numerous ropes and folded them away. Underneath, she wore flight battle gear. She planted her hands on her hips and offered a knowing smile.</p><p>A hand caught Vela\u2019s arm and held her fast. She turned and stared at one of the wreckers. She didn\u2019t even try to pull away from him; her body seemed frozen, incapable of movement.</p><p>Sharav lifted his wrist to his mouth and spoke softly. The next moment, an explosion sounded behind her, so loud that she gave a cry and tried to cover her ears, but the wrecker jerked her arm, forcing her to hold still.</p><p>He turned her to face the direction of the blast. A shotgun had just taken out the darkening wall, the smoky ash boiling past the breach, obscuring what lay beyond.</p><p>He yanked her through the breach, into a stone cell, on Third Earth proper, a very familiar cell. The air smelled funny, tainted, then she looked at the floor.</p><p>Blood.</p><p>She covered her mouth with her hand. This had been Duncan\u2019s cell. She stood in the remnants of his blood.</p><p>Samuel arrived next, carried by three wreckers, his head lolling. She stood by helpless as they bound him with heavy ropes, each length carrying a preternatural charge. They strung him up by his wrists from a swivel hook on the ceiling.</p><p>Two of them caught her beneath her arms, pulled her backward, then bound her with rope to wrought iron rings on a wall ten feet from Samuel.</p><p>The odd thought went through her head that for an advanced, more powerful civilization, Third Earth still relied on some very ancient methods.</p><p>Sharav emerged from the darkening tunnel, the looped braids beside his face swinging as he moved.</p><p>He smiled, the easy smile of a powerful man who owned the room.</p><p>\u201cHow do you do Vela Stillwell of Phoenix Two? Are you comfortable?\u201d She lifted her arms, pulling at the ropes that bound her to the wall. \u201cI\u2019d be more comfortable in a recliner, but so far I can\u2019t complain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least you\u2019re not sniveling and begging to be released.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about this: fuck you, Sharav.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you know my name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know the man who tortured Samuel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you led him right to me. But just to be clear, I won\u2019t be keeping you around much longer, just enough to give your man a little heartache. And though your power, for a Second ascender, is impressive, on Third, sweetheart, you\u2019re pretty mediocre.\u201d Something inside Vela grew very still. He\u2019d tortured both Duncan and Samuel, transformed Samuel into a Third Earth warrior against his will, and now intended her death. Well, she wasn\u2019t dead yet, so for now, she stayed focused and relaxed. If there was a way to take this motherfucker out, she meant to do it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes, you have some spirit. I\u2019ll give you that.\u201d Vela thought about his earlier remark, that Sharav had gone through some hoops to get Samuel back. \u201cSo, let me understand, you designed this whole situation, to get Samuel under your control again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything having to do with Duncan, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? What can Samuel possibly mean to you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve felt his power, so you know that he possesses enormous potential. I just wasn\u2019t able to bring it to fullness before he escaped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas I part of the plan?\u201d Sharav turned toward her more fully.</p><p>\u201cNo, which makes you extremely problematic for me on many levels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I see. Even though you were in the future streams, at the Illinois Seers Palace, you never saw me coming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t hurt now to tell you the truth, but no, I didn\u2019t. You are one big annoying surprise.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, at least I have that,\u201d she said, holding his gaze steady. \u201cThat I\u2019ve annoyed you.\u201d He moved closer and before she could even prepare, he slapped her hard across the face. The sting hurt, the surprise of it frightened her, but it was the ensuing pain that made her head hang. Her jaw felt like he\u2019d just crushed it with that blow and a couple of her teeth were loose.</p><p>She felt her vampire healing kick in and did nothing else except let it flow.</p><p>Just in case, she could figure some way out of this mess, she at least needed her jaw and head intact.</p><p>Sharav moved toward Samuel. Vela could see him through a blur of watery eyes, another unwelcome effect of the blow. She blinked until the tears disappeared.</p><p>The goateed asshole approached Samuel from the front, folded off Samuel\u2019s weapons harness, and planted one hand on the center of his chest and one hand on his forehead.</p><p>Samuel\u2019s body jerked hard but he lifted his head, his eyes rolling. \u201cFuck,\u201d he murmured. Then, \u201cVela?\u201d I\u2019m here. To your right. I\u2019m alive.</p> <p>He tried to turn his head toward her but Sharav caught his face in his hands. \u201cI have you back now, my boy. This time, nothing will take you from me and this time, we\u2019re going to tap that power deep and bring it forward for all to see. In fact, we\u2019re going to do it right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you, Sharav.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re slurring because one of my wreckers hit you across the back of your head and you\u2019re still not quite in control.\u201d He lifted Samuel\u2019s arm and gave it a tug, which set the ceiling hook pivoting a quarter turn.</p><p>Vela could see his face now. He had to work at focusing.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s your woman. Don\u2019t worry.</p><p>She\u2019s all right. I just had to shut her up.\u201d What did he do to you?</p><p>Doesn\u2019t matter.</p><p>She looked into Samuel\u2019s gray eyes, and saw his determination grow. She could feel it, that he was trying to access the killing part of his power.</p> <p>So could Sharav, because he stepped away from him. At the same time, Samuel\u2019s dark, grayle mist flowed from his body, that part of his mist-power that he could control.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Sharav said. \u201cLet it build, that angry stream of rage that has lived in you since our time together in Honduras Two. Every lash, every cut, every bruise brought this power to the surface.</p><p>\u201cRelease it, Samuel. Let me see the power that got you out of that prison- fortress, the one that Endelle\u2019s grid could never find.\u201d Vela sensed Samuel\u2019s power rising, the same power that he feared to release more than anything else in his life.</p><p>She began to hope. She knew Samuel\u2019s mind and the rage he carried toward Sharav, his desire to kill him. If Samuel could use all that power, aim it at Sharav...</p><p>But even as the thought flowed through her head, she knew exactly what was going to happen.</p><p>Samuel, she began, Don\u2019t! This is what he wants!</p><p>But Samuel had blocked her, his mist flowing in streams, though not like before, much heavier this time and whipping from side-to-side.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she shouted. \u201cSamuel, no!\u201d But Samuel focused his attention on Sharav, whose eyes glowed, and who murmured quietly, \u201cWeakling.\u201d That did it.</p><p>Samuel\u2019s secondary grayle power rose, a dark stream of energy that poured from him, straight at Sharav.</p><p>For a moment, hope soared, but Sharav merely smiled, lifted his hand, and Samuel\u2019s terrible, deadly energy angled off his palm and hit Vela square in the chest.</p><p>She jerked hard as a sensation like lightning struck her body.</p><p>She expected her heart to stop working all at once, but on some level, she recognized and loved that power, knew it to be essentially all Samuel.</p><p>Some of the power shunted through her system to invade her arms and legs, but the rest began a slow, painful intrusion in the direction of her heart. Her breath came in gasps.</p><p>Vela. I can\u2019t stop this.</p><p>I know.</p><p>Hold on.</p><p>Vela felt the power driving into her chest in fractional increments. She tried to set up a shield but failed. She tried mentally to move it elsewhere, but couldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cSharav,\u201d Samuel cried out. \u201cLet her go. She\u2019s done nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s interfered and made my life difficult. We\u2019ve lost several excellent wreckers because of her. She must die but I wanted you to be involved, to enjoy the moment, the pure poetry of it.\u201d Sharav then released his palm and for a split-second, Vela hoped this one act would end the stream, instead, the flow of Samuel\u2019s power became a straight arrow toward Vela, doubling in strength.</p><p>But Sharav frowned. \u201cShe has more power than I thought, to have withstood your grayle stream this long.\u201d The words meant something to Vela, striking a deep chord, one that Samuel had touched on earlier, about her life and her choices, about what the death vampire attack had done to her. Somehow the answer to this brutal situation lay within those words, that she had more power than even Sharav knew and that to get out of this situation, she needed to believe in who she was, who she\u2019d always been.</p><p>When she thought of that attack so many decades ago, a new awareness came to her, that Jeff had heard her calling to him. But that wasn\u2019t possible because she\u2019d screamed from her mind, a telepathic cry, and he didn\u2019t have advanced mind-to-mind abilities. Yet that was exactly what had happened. She\u2019d called out for help, her mind to his, directing those thoughts outside herself, and Jeff had come.</p><p>She had essentially rescued herself.</p><p>But what good would that do in this situation? She might be able to reach Endelle telepathically, but even Her Supremeness couldn\u2019t access the Third grid or even fold to Third because the portal was sealed up tight. She was on her own.</p><p>Samuel couldn\u2019t believe that he was killing the woman he loved, the thing he\u2019d feared the most, that somehow his power would escape him and he\u2019d murder another innocent. He just never thought it would be Vela because he\u2019d been so careful.</p><p>And he had no control over the stream of energy, no shut-off switch.</p><p>He tried to remember how he\u2019d stopped it while in Honduras. He remembered running, but the power still trailed from him, and reached for anything living as he ran forward. He\u2019d become a vampire killing machine.</p><p>Duncan had escaped because he\u2019d warned him to fold the hell out of the region, otherwise he would have died that day as well.</p><p>He\u2019d reached the top of a hill and screamed his rage until he\u2019d fallen unconscious. And maybe that was what he needed to do right now. He started to shout but Sharav placed a hand on his head and he couldn\u2019t move.</p><p>\u201cJust stay focused, just like this.\u201d Samuel couldn\u2019t move, couldn\u2019t do a damn thing.</p><p>He met Vela\u2019s gaze and mouthed, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Me, too. My fault. I was stubborn. I should have listened to you about who I am. Now it\u2019s too late.</p><p>He agonized as his dark power streamed toward her, hurting her, driving toward her heart, seeking her death.</p><p>How he loved this woman.</p><p>He grew very still in his spirit and his thoughts took a new direction as in how he\u2019d ended up here. What had he done wrong? Not seen?</p><p>He\u2019d tried to avoid this exact situation, yet here he hung, the flip side of hi s grayle power pummeling an innocent woman. He thought he\u2019d had a good handle on protecting those around him, by restraining his power and refusing to allow Vela to mind-dive.</p><p>He understood now that Sharav had been using him as some kind of experiment, to transform him perhaps into a Third Earth warrior that could be controlled, made into a weapon for Chustaffus or one of the other faction leaders.</p><p>As past images flowed through his mind, a shadowy figure emerged and he knew then that Chustaffus had been to Honduras Two on more than one occasion, maybe even directing the experiments. A feeling of age flowed toward him and around him as he remembered Chustaffus. An ancient evil.</p><p>He recalled Vela saying to him so recently that he had a real problem connecting and suddenly the pieces fell together in his mind. He\u2019d refused to let her in because it seemed the safest bet, but not because of his dangerous power, but because he\u2019d never let anyone in before, not once in his long life. His rugged man\u2019s life had taught him to keep close connections at bay, with everyone.</p><p>And she\u2019d been right about the Warriors of the Blood. A close knit group like that demanded connection, deeper than he\u2019d ever had with any of the Militia Warriors, not Duncan, not Gideon, not any of them.</p><p>I want you to mind-dive, Vela.</p><p>She lifted her weary head to look at him, her breaths in shallow pants as his grayle stream pressed into her. \u201cYou want me to mind-dive?\u201d she said aloud.</p><p>Sharav laughed. \u201cYes, do that Vela.</p><p>Mind-dive and let all that power take out your brain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re enjoying this, aren\u2019t you, Sharav?\u201d Samuel asked.</p><p>\u201cVery much. Death can be a beautiful thing to watch, a kind of thrill that never ceases to please.\u201d A red hue colored his cheeks as he licked his lips, as if hungry for more.</p><p>Samuel turned toward the woman he loved, his breh, and then he understood what needed to be done, how he fit with Vela, how their powers could mesh, if he would only let her in. \u201cMind-dive, Vela. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Don\u2019t listen to him.

At the same time, Samuel seemed different and determined about allowing her to mind- dive, but it was also clear he had a reason for wanting her to do it.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you waiting for,\u201d Sharav said. \u201cJump into his mind.\u201d Then Vela got it, the real adventure she needed to take, if she had enough courage.</p><p>She recalled what had happened with Alison the night before, how Alison\u2019s healing empathic power had flowed, easing Vela, then suddenly how Vela had comprehended Alison\u2019s power and returned the favor.</p> <p>At the time, Vela had thought she might have emerging empathic abilities, but now she understood the truth; she could join herself to another power and reflect it, perhaps even make it stronger.</p><p>Did Samuel know? Was that why he\u2019d suggested a mind-dive?</p><p>But this wasn\u2019t about mind-diving; it was about connecting. And Samuel was ready.</p><p>And what do you know? She wanted this adventure, too.</p><p>With the current stream of energy so close to taking her life, Vela released the last of her fears and embraced all that her powers could mean in her life. She thought about how she had reflected Alison\u2019s healing power and with that thought, she took hold of Samuel\u2019s grayle power, bringing it into her fully so that the stream, instead of punching through her heart, disseminated and flooded her body with tremendous strength and purpose.</p><p>Still holding Samuel\u2019s gaze, and fully aware that Sharav had no idea what had just happened, she lifted her hands and focused Samuel\u2019s stream of power, now greater and stronger, in Sharav\u2019s direction.</p> <p>T h e grayle stream hit him unprepared, and the look of horror that crossed his face as the blast struck home, told Vela all that she needed to know.</p><p>She gave full rein to her reflective power, not hesitating for a moment, not even with the knowledge that Sharav would die because of it. He staggered on his feet, then flew backward, his eyes rolling as an anguished sound burst from his throat.</p><p>A dark mist boiled from the center of his chest.</p><p>Vela let it run until she saw that a deep cavity remained where Sharav\u2019s ribs, lungs, and heart used to reside, the stench in the room almost overpowering.</p><p>But the moment she wanted the stream to stop, it stopped.</p><p>She stared at Sharav for a long moment, then shifted to Samuel to meet his gaze, then upward to the ropes that still bound him.</p><p>Samuel gathered his strength and began to pull. He grunted and shouted, tugging on the bindings. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get out of here, before a crew shows up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what about the ropes?\u201d Her gaze traveled to the ceiling hook.</p> <p>Samuel smiled as he started straining against the knots. \u201cHere\u2019s the good news.</p><p>The power inherent in these bindings, belonged to Sharav, now he\u2019s dead.\u201d The ropes started to snap so that within a few seconds, he\u2019d freed himself.</p><p>He crossed to Vela and ripped the rope bindings off her wrists, dragged her against his waist, and closed his eyes. He mentally sought for his sword and found it surrounded by a crew designed to salvage identified weapons. He folded the sword into his hand.</p><p>He heard running footsteps and watched as the grid wall began to close.</p><p>But the opening allowed him to do a last second fold and he took them both within.</p><p>\u201cMy turn,\u201d Vela said. She put on her best speed and the next moment raced through the darkening.</p><p>Explosions sounded behind them and not far away at all.</p><p>Can I help? he sent.</p><p>Just hold me close. That\u2019s helping.</p><p>Samuel let his power flow, but he sensed it could do nothing to aid with her speed, so he addressed another potential problem.</p><p>Merl, he sent. We\u2019re on our way back to your house. Sharav laid a trap, but he\u2019s dead now. Wreckers at our heels.</p><p>Got it. Calling in reinforcements.</p><p>On through dozens of criss-crossing tunnels, Vela never failing to make instant choices.</p><p>He felt them cross the dimensional boundary, like a preternatural speed- bump.</p><p>We\u2019re almost there, Vela sent. But another explosion hit close and debris bit at his calves.</p><p>One more tunnel.</p><p>And damn would you look at that.</p><p>Where Merl\u2019s wall used to exist, and just inside the darkening grid, stood an array of Warrior of the Blood power that not even a wrecking crew could withstand because each held one of the re-identified shotguns: Thorne, Leto, and this time, Luken, whose mere size would deter the best wrecker warrior any day.</p><p>Of course the explosions had also taken out Merl\u2019s wall, but the bastard, standing in his living room beyond, grinned.</p><p>As Samuel and Vela passed by the What-Bees and essentially ran straight into Merl\u2019s house, Samuel whirled and watched as a wrecking crew broke through the opposite wall. They met a hail of rapid weapon-fire as all three warriors, Luken clearly up to speed, unloaded their weapons and vaporized the enemy.</p><p>Yet even in the distance another explosion sounded as a second crew approached.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve only got a few seconds,\u201d Vela cried out.</p><p>Merl shouted, \u201cMove out of the grid now!\u201d The three warriors turned and leaped. Just as Merl started closing up the darkening wall, an explosion ripped through the air as another wrecking crew arrived, shotguns at their hips.</p><p>Vela joined Merl, this time planting a hand on his shoulder, instead of on the wall, experiencing his power and reflecting it. As the second squad fired, her power spread over the darkening wall.</p><p>Samuel watched a golden aura pass over the wall, creating a seal even as the explosion sounded from the other side.</p><p>The air vibrated strangely.</p><p>The aura wavered.</p><p>Samuel held his breath.</p><p>But the wall held.</p><p>Silence reigned for a good long moment, until Merl stepped away from the wall and turned to face the room. \u201cWe\u2019re good.\u201d Vela shifted as well.</p><p>Samuel glanced from one astonished face to the other, adrenaline still flowing through every vein present and all but singing through the air.</p><p>Vela planted her hands on her hips.</p><p>\u201cWell, that was fun.\u201d Everyone laughed.</p><p>Samuel crossed to her and took her in his arms. His head fucking hurt, but Vela lived and right now nothing else mattered.</p><p>Back in Endelle\u2019s private suite, Vela sat on Samuel\u2019s lap in the large purple chair that faced away from the open air wall. Endelle had called the gathering to announce that for the first time in over 200 hundred years, the Warriors of the Blood would have a new member.</p><p>An hour earlier, they\u2019d each shared their experiences with Endelle in her private office, with Thorne present as well. Endelle had made her position clear.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better join up, asshole, and start working out with your new brothers, or next time you and your woman might not be so lucky. We clear?\u201d Samuel had surprised Vela by merely nodding. \u201cYes, Madame Endelle. It would be my honor to serve.\u201d Now they were here among a gathering of some of Second Earth\u2019s most powerful vampires.</p><p>From her position, she could see everyone clearly, including those who ranged behind the chair in which she sat.</p><p>Even baby Helena flew from ascender to ascender, up to her antics that kept the warriors saying, \u201cJust like her dad.\u201d Kerrick stood near Alison, smiling and holding his left arm in a crook for the baby to land. Apparently, they\u2019d been teaching her boundaries but the challenges of parenting, true from the beginning of time, never ceased.</p><p>Luken, Zacharius, and Santiago addressed the real flying-baby problem, having formed a line in front of the space where a wall should have existed. Endelle had built the palace with lots of open-air balconies and no windows. Baby Helena, in true \u2018like father\u2019 mode, kept testing all three warriors, trying to find her way into the wild.</p><p>Vela watched Helena fly toward the men, but each started jumping up and down and waving his arms, which kept the toddler from moving forward. Fortunately, she grew fatigued easily, so Santiago formed an arm-crook, and Helena made another landing. She leaned her head on his arm and he spoke to her with the softest smile on his lips, as the flutter of her wings kept her balanced.</p><p>At a right angle to Vela\u2019s position, and not far from the three un-bonded warriors, Alison stood talking quietly to Fiona, who in turn leaned against her breh, Jean-Pierre.</p><p>On the far wall, near the entrance to the room, Antony and Parisa stood together, looking fatigued since they\u2019d just gotten back from a wings of fire demonstration in Europe Two, just outside of Paris. Antony had his arm around Parisa, holding her close. He kept dipping down and whispering things to her that made her blush. She\u2019d then lift up, and kiss him on the lips. Even though Parisa stood five-ten in her bare feet, Antony towered over her at six-seven.</p><p>On the couch nearest Vela, Havily sat beside Marcus. They held hands, but from the time they\u2019d entered the room, the pair had engaged in an argument about some web-campaign or other. Between clashes, however, Marcus would lift their joined fingers and plant a couple of kisses on the back of her hand that always made Havily smile.</p><p>Directly across from Vela, in a matching, warrior-sized purple chair, Grace sat on Leto\u2019s lap, her head buried in his shoulder. She sighed several times.</p><p>The breh-hedden had invaded their lives in a serious way only a month ago. The joke made the rounds often that they were on their breh- moon. From the way Leto stared at Grace, Vela knew he wasn\u2019t thinking about anything in this room right now, maybe just how soon he could be alone with his woman.</p><p>Thorne stood guard at the door, his arms folded over his chest, his expression serious. She could almost read his mind, that his thoughts remained in his Command Center and with the hundreds of thousands of Militia Warriors at risk because of three rogue generals.</p><p>Thorne\u2019s breh, Marguerite, was the only one of the group not present. But she\u2019d put in a long day with her Seers and because she carried twins in her seventh month, she needed her rest and had begged off from the meeting. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As for Merl, he hung back, leaning against the wall a few feet beyond Luken.</p><p>He occasionally drew a lit cigarette to his lips, which he held low and away. His gaze, however, rarely strayed from Endelle. Vela thought Braulio might be wise to find his way back to Second Earth, the sooner the better. To leave a woman hanging for a month, especially one like Endelle, didn\u2019t bode well for the longevity of the relationship.</p><p>Samuel hadn\u2019t lost physical contact with her from the time they\u2019d been in the darkening, always holding her hand, touching her, drifting his hand up and down the center of her back. Her chest kept expanding.</p> <p>Samuel had been right. She\u2019d loved her adventurous life and the death vampire attack so many decades ago had stolen that from her. But her spirit had been reborn over the past two days through so many harrowing experiences.</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t be a counselor; she\u2019d made that decision. But just what would occupy her time she couldn\u2019t say except that Endelle had just added Vela to her immediate staff as a Third Earth Liaison, duties to be defined as events unfolded.</p><p>\u201cBecause we have Vela\u2019s future settled as well,\u201d Endelle said, turning toward Samuel, \u201cI think I need to make something clear to you, Warrior. We haven\u2019t had an induction into the Warriors of the Blood since Jean-Pierre here,\u201d she waved a hand in his direction to her left.</p><p>\u201cAnd that was over two-hundred-years ago. You\u2019d better do us proud.\u201d She then called out to Luken, \u201cHow about you take it from here.\u201d Luken stepped away from the balcony, moving past Endelle so that he could face Samuel. Kerrick shifted back into position next to Santiago, to make sure his daughter didn\u2019t escape.</p><p>Luken was the biggest of all the warriors and had a tenderness unsurpassed, for a man built for war. His crystal blue eyes never looked less than haunted and Vela knew his gaze skated everywhere struggling hard not to land on Havily, who he\u2019d loved from the time of her Ascension over a hundred years ago.</p> <p>Luken was a good man, a worthy man, former European Two royalty, and wore his long blond hair, like all the What-Bees did, caught back in the cadroen.</p><p>\u201cWarrior Samuel, back-up Section Leader for the Thunder God Warriors, I invite you to join the Warriors of the Blood. If you accept, you\u2019ll be under my direct leadership and subject to terms of service as dictated by the Supreme High Administrator of Second Earth. And I do mean dictated.\u201d A masculine chuckle flowed through the room.</p><p>\u201cAll the warriors present in this room discussed and approved your invitation to rise to Warrior of the Blood status by the only manner a warrior can rise: unanimous agreement and consent.</p><p>Your service will continue until you are called to either Third Earth for permanent ascension, or until the Creator should call you home. Do you accept our invitation?\u201d Vela tried to leave Samuel\u2019s lap because the moment seemed to call for some level of decorum, but he prevented her, saying quietly, \u201cDon\u2019t leave. This is the way I want it; with you close by.</p><p>We\u2019re connected now.\u201d Her throat tightened. She met his gaze and nodded.</p><p>To Luken, he said, \u201cI accept. With all my heart, and without the smallest reservation, I accept.\u201d The cheer that went up, so full of the deep masculine sound of the warriors\u2019 combined voices, thrilled Vela to the center of her being. Nothing could have been more perfect or more beautiful.</p> <p>Endelle glanced at Marcus. \u201cWhat the fuck are you doing on your cell? Can\u2019t you see we\u2019re having a goddamn moment here?\u201d But Marcus looked up at her and said. \u201cI know this isn\u2019t the most appropriate moment, and Warrior Samuel, forgive me for this, but if we had the induction ceremony in Paris\u2014\u201d He let the suggestion hang.</p><p>Samuel said, \u201cI thought it would be here, at the palace. I assumed it would be.\u201d Vela shifted to look at Marcus. \u201cI get it,\u201d she said, turning back to Samuel. \u201cOne of the rogue generals operates a base out of Romania Two and his strategies include working our allies in Western Europe. A ceremony in Paris would send a strong message.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Marcus said.</p><p>Endelle rolled her eyes. \u201cDoes everything we do have to involve some kind of political slant?\u201d At least five of the ascenders responded in unison, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, shit.\u201d She scowled. \u201cI was looking forward to a kegger in the desert.\u201d Marcus just shook his head.</p><p>\u201cFine-uh,\u201d she stated. \u201cLuken, you came out of that damn royalty jungle in Western Europe Two, and I know you were glad to get the hell out. You okay with this?\u201d Vela knew that Luken had fringe ties with European royalty and that he hadn\u2019t been back from the time he\u2019d signed on as a Warrior of the Blood centuries ago.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Luken said. \u201cWe have to do everything we can right now.\u201d However, he turned to Marcus and lowered his chin. \u201cBut don\u2019t fucking ask me to do more than that, you got it?\u201d Marcus waited a beat, holding Luken\u2019s gaze steadily, then said, \u201cUnderstood.\u201d Endelle tilted her head. \u201cSamuel, you good with all this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d The Supreme High Administrator of Second Earth made a raspy sound at the back of her throat. \u201cDamn war.\u201d She glanced around, her gaze finally landing once more on Samuel. \u201cTake your woman home. You still live in your Scottsdale house, not far from Gideon\u2019s?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d She smiled. \u201cWe have something in common, you and me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?</p><p>\u201cWe both like our homes to hang off mountainsides.\u201d He returned the smile. \u201cI guess we do at that.\u201d She nodded a few times briskly.</p><p>\u201cWelcome home, warrior. I like this new grayle power of yours and you\u2019ll make a fine addition to the Warriors of the Blood.</p><p>Just to be safe, I\u2019ll set a dome of protective mist over your house for the time being, at least until we see if any of Sharav\u2019s buddies want you dead as well.</p><p>We\u2019ll pick all of this back up tomorrow.</p><p>Both of you be at my office at ten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Madame Endelle.\u201d She glanced at the group, left to right.</p><p>\u201cWe have a war to finish, people, and now some sort of Third bullshit to deal with. Those of you heading out to battle, get going. The rest of you, head home.\u201d Everyone started rising from the couches and chairs or leaning away from walls, when Marcus spoke up. \u201cOne more thing, everyone. The induction ceremony will be black tie, with a ball afterwards and several receptions preceding. Just thought you should be prepared.\u201d A general round of groans followed, but Endelle summed it up, \u201cAw, fuck.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>\u201cThis is your home?\u201d Vela looked around awestruck.</p><p>Samuel smiled. \u201cNot what you expected?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should say not and yet it suits you so well.\u201d Just as Endelle had said, he\u2019d built the house on a hillside overlooking the northern reaches of Scottsdale Two, but the entire back half of the large sprawling home encompassed a massive atrium, three stories high.</p><p>He led Vela into the atrium, where three large, wood-carved hawks, painted in great detail, cruised the air streams. A forest of plants below them sweetened the air. \u201cI\u2019d had a sort of vision for this decades ago. I needed a house, but I thought, what the hell, I didn\u2019t want the same-old, same-old.\u201d He gestured west. \u201cYou can see through the front windows and the view is beautiful night or day. That long ridge in the distance the White Tanks, of course, and beyond that the White Lake Resort Colony.\u201d She turned back to the atrium. \u201cThis is amazing. Stone, wood, glass.\u201d She turned toward him. \u201cWho did the work for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA designer. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve heard of her. Tazianne?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Who hasn\u2019t? She\u2019s won a lot of awards. I know that Warrior Antony has a piece in his villa.\u201d She tilted her head. \u201cYou\u2019re an amazing mix, Samuel: powerful as hell, kind, and now a surprising architectural aesthetic. And yet I\u2019m not surprised. I\u2019ve had a sense of you from the first, a gift of the breh-hedden, I think, and all of this fits, helping me to see the whole man. Although I suspect if I went to the fridge\u2014\u201d She let the words hang.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cWhat can I say?</p><p>Unfortunately, Merl and I have a few things in common.\u201d As he met Vela\u2019s gaze and absorbed her compliments, all that she\u2019d said beyond the oh-so-true food comment, the shift in his life stunned him. How much his world had changed in two days that what had seemed right, now seemed so wrong, that he had lived his solitary existence content. \u201cI want you to know that you\u2019re the first woman I\u2019ve brought here, Vela. I want you to know that, how much you mean to me.\u201d She nodded and reached for his hand.</p><p>\u201cSo what do you want, Samuel, here, tonight? Do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s only one thing I want right now, but I\u2019m not sure how you\u2019ll feel about it.\u201d He drew her into his arms, adjusting to make sure he didn\u2019t pin down all that hair, and took a deep breath. \u201cI want to complete the breh-hedden with you.\u201d She slid her hands around his neck.</p><p>\u201cYou know that means mind-diving, right?\u201d But she smiled, such a beautiful smile, her large blue eyes glittering.</p><p>\u201cI know that it means you\u2019ll know more about me than you may ever want to know.\u201d A chill went through him of what he\u2019d endured at Sharav\u2019s hand. He hated the thought of her seeing any of that.</p><p>\u201cSamuel, I\u2019m prepared. And I know that I\u2019ll see things that will distress me, but I can handle it.\u201d He nodded. \u201cOkay. So the breh- hedden is what you want as well?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWithout question. You were so right about me. When I was chained up in Duncan\u2019s cell, and your power beat at me, I remembered something about that attack in 1922: I wasn\u2019t as unequipped as I\u2019d always thought. I called for Jeff. I did that myself telepathically. The moment I realized my part in surviving the attack, I knew I wouldn\u2019t ever go back to my former life, that what I wanted, what I needed was right here with you, with this crazy darkening power, and with whatever the future holds.\u201d He kissed her, a single kiss on the lips then drew back. \u201cI hated seeing you chained up then attacked by my own power and it\u2019s going to take me some time to get over what happened to you, to us. At the same time, it pushed me where I needed to go. You were right; I\u2019ve been afraid of connection all my life.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut you\u2019re not anymore.\u201d He chuckled softly. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that. Let\u2019s just say, I want to connect with you and I know I belong fighting beside the Warriors of the Blood. No question.</p><p>But it\u2019s you, Vela, you\u2019re the why of this moment, why I would say yes to something so invasive as the breh-hedden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel exactly the same way.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know. God, I\u2019m so sorry you had to be in that cell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not, well maybe I am, but look where it got us?\u201d He watched tears fill her eyes and love suddenly flowed like a powerful force through his body, a rush of heat, affection, and desire combined. He kissed her and she moaned, her lips parting. He drove his tongue into her, tasting her, savoring the feel of her in his arms. Never in a thousand years would he have believed that something like this, so full of passion, sex, and love would have descended on his life.</p><p>He was amazed. \u201cLet me take you to bed.\u201d She nodded.</p><p>He slid an arm around her shoulders beneath the weight of her hair and using his free arm to catch her behind her knees, he lifted her up. Carrying her meant something, that she belonged to him and more of that warm affection flowed.</p><p>He moved out of the atrium and down the stone path that led to his bedroom. The wall curved, so he shifted her at an angle taking care that he didn\u2019t bump her head or crush her foot.</p> <p>As he carried her across the threshold, she gave a soft cry. \u201cLook at that view.\u201d Scattered lights twinkled in a long vista north to south.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I chose this site.\u201d His bedroom had a wall of windows and no neighbors, just a view of distant lights, and various hills creating a soft dark skyline against a panorama of stars.</p><p>He turned her in the direction of his massive larger-than-king bed.</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s a big bed,\u201d she said, laughter in her voice, a sound he\u2019d come to love. Vela had a basic love of life.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I say? I like room to spread out when I sleep.\u201d She looked up at him and caught his face in her hand. \u201cAnd you won\u2019t mind me taking up some of that space?\u201d His heart did that balloon floating thing and a soft moan left his throat. \u201cNo. I want you taking up that space more than anything in the world. I love you. There I\u2019ve said it. I love you, Vela.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, too. I honestly didn\u2019t think I\u2019d have love again, ever. My life had closed down to this small little box that I\u2019d crawled into when Jeff died. And now you\u2019re here, this tremendous miracle in my life.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis is a miracle, isn\u2019t it?\u201d She nodded, then leaned in to kiss him, a sealing of vows spoken, of desire and need, of hearts reaching and joining.</p><p>When he drew back, he said, \u201cI will always love you, Vela, and be so grateful that you came into my life and that you didn\u2019t hold back when all this happened between us. You could have, but you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel exactly the same way about you, that I\u2019m so grateful.\u201d He set her down on the bed, her light floral scent teasing him all over again, reminding him that what he had with Vela belonged to just a handful of ascenders.</p><p>The breh-hedden.</p><p>When she stretched out on her back, he leaned down, planting his hands on the bed, on either side of her, and kissed her, a soft pushing at her lips, imagining doing the same thing between her legs.</p><p>When her lips parted and his tongue slid into her mouth, he groaned. Her scent now suffused the air; the breh-hedden at its best.</p><p>He sighed as he drew back. \u201cI feel as though I\u2019ve known you all my life. How strange is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery, but I feel the same way. I think we may have lived a lifetime together in the past two days.\u201d She chuckled softly.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe several lifetimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you might be right.\u201d She reached up and slid her hands into his hair, pulling it forward over his shoulders. \u201cI love your hair.\u201d She leaned close and sniffed. \u201cIt smells like you.</p><p>Chocolate and man together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmmm, and I\u2019m smelling\u2014\u201d He sniffed then shook his head. \u201cI know your fragrance, but I still can\u2019t place it. Maybe one day I\u2019ll figure it out, but it\u2019s very light and floral. Seductive.\u201d She leaned up and kissed him. Your scent heats me up so fast.</p><p>He kissed her repeatedly, drawing her closer, savoring the feel of her against him. But he thought-the-thought and got rid of his weapons harness, which prompted an approving murmur from her throat.</p><p>After a moment, she pulled back to meet his gaze, a hand on his chest. \u201cI think I should tell you flat out that I\u2019m nervous about completing the breh-hedden. I mean, I want to. I really do. I don\u2019t have any doubts, I\u2019m just excited and anxious at the same time. I can\u2019t imagine what it will be like, but did you see Leto and Grace earlier?\u201d He chuckled softly, kissing her neck.</p><p>\u201cHe wanted her home in bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. And now here we are.\u201d Samuel could sense her fears, but they felt normal to him and to a degree mirrored his own edged-up state. But he thought he knew how to get things moving in the right direction.</p><p>While she lay on her back, he started unbuttoning her blouse, and each time he did, he dipped down and kissed her chest, lower each time, until his tongue slid between the beautiful line of her cleavage.</p><p>Her hands worked his hair and slid over his back.</p><p>He plunged his tongue in and out until she panted and pressed against him, trying to get closer.</p><p>It takes so little, she sent , to get worked up with you. I have your scent in my nose and I swear it feeds straight into my brain and makes me dizzy and weak.</p><p>I want you weak, he returned, continuing to ply his tongue between her breasts. At the same time, he worked the rest of the buttons loose and shoved her blouse away.</p><p>He drew back just enough to have a good look. Vela had beautiful breasts, very round and full. He put his hand on her bra and folded it away.</p><p>Her nipples, now tight buds, called to him.</p><p>Once more he dipped but this time to take a breast in his mouth. He flipped his tongue sideways over the nipple then sent, I want to release a potion. Okay?</p><p>Oh. God. Yes.</p><p>Her legs hung over the side of the bed so he pushed her knees wide, then stepped between.</p><p>Because she was nervous, he had a plan and he meant to work it so that by the time he took her the distance with the breh-hedden, she\u2019d be more than ready.</p><p>He settled a hand low on her hip, leaned over her once more and, with his lips, slowly tended to each breast.</p><p>You feelin\u2019 this, Vela?</p><p>Yes. Your tongue is like fire on me.</p><p>He flicked her nipples, one after the other, with just the tip of his tongue, moving between them. When the moaning started, he paused over her right breast, released his fangs and struck, the potion flowing at the same time. He removed his fangs and took as much of her breast in his mouth as he could. He sucked hard on the nipple.</p><p>Small cries left her throat in a series of staccatos. I\u2019m on fire. Oh, your potion is amazing.</p><p>He sensed her need and folded off her jeans then rubbed her inner thighs and worked his way toward her mons. He played with her bareness, tracing her swollen lips down and down until he found the source of her wetness. He slid his finger inside and her body arched.</p><p>\u201cSo close,\u201d she said aloud.</p><p>He removed his finger, then plunged two inside and thrust in and out in a strong steady rhythm, sucking her nipple and letting the potion do its work.</p><p>Vela loved a well-placed potion.</p><p>The fire around her nipple kept spreading through both breasts and even now seeped into her abdomen.</p><p>Samuel used his fingers exactly right, not too fast, so that she lived on the edge of an orgasm, panting lightly, waiting for the potion to travel right where she wanted it, straight through her clitoris.</p><p>I\u2019m holding steady for you, Vela.</p><p>You waiting until the potion floods your entire body?</p><p>Her mind sent something in answer to his question, a \u2018yes\u2019, but probably garbled. She trusted Samuel to understand and since she felt or heard him chuckle, as he continued to suck and to plunge his finger in and out of her, she felt confident he knew exactly what she wanted.</p><p>The potion continued its journey. She turned her head to the side, grasping for small puffs of air, and releasing even smaller bits.</p><p>She was so close, so close.</p><p>Her voice emitted small grunts and she didn\u2019t even care how it sounded. She kept her mind focused on only one thing, the way the potion crept lower, now only an inch away, now less.</p><p>The sensation flooded her clitoris all at once and she screamed as she came.</p><p>Samuel thrust his fingers harder, which intensified the pulses deep in her body.</p><p>Her back arched and the sensation held, throbbing, sending pleasure over and over through her well, into her abdomen, up and up. But when it passed, she was still left with more fire, more need.</p><p>Samuel slowed his movements. Then after a few seconds he began again, which caught her by surprise because another orgasm swept through her, the fire all along her torso now spreading up through her shoulders and down her legs.</p><p>She wanted to grab him, roll his hips onto her and beg him to take her, but she couldn\u2019t seem to move, just feel the pleasure rolling through her in successive waves.</p><p>Finally, she grew very still, almost frozen in place, as though holding onto the sensations that had just rocked through her.</p><p>\u201cThat was...magnificent.\u201d She couldn\u2019t believe she\u2019d even gotten the words out of her mouth.</p><p>He removed his fingers then rose up to fold away his kilt and battle sandals. \u201cI loved feeling all that happen to you, the way your body moved as I sucked your breast.\u201d She nodded and when she realized he\u2019d lost his clothes, she sat up on the edge of the bed and placed her hands on his thick, heavy pecs. She started to play with him then had a new idea: again, turnabout\u2019s fair play.</p><p>She met his gaze and saw the soft smile on his lips. \u201cWhat do you want from me, Vela? Tell me. I\u2019ll do anything you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you on your back. You game, warrior?\u201d He seemed to lose focus for a moment then took her hand and drew her to her feet. \u201cLet\u2019s get rid of the comforter first.\u201d She watched him fold the comforter back in thirds then flip it off the end of the bed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But as he turned and looked at her, he stopped all movement, a beautiful Greek statue in the moonlight.</p><p>His gaze drifted slowly down her body then back up. She had intended to order him onto the bed, but the look on his face, of utter reverence, stopped her, at least for the moment. He drew her into his arms. Feeling the length of his body pressed against hers as he kissed her deeply, as he held her in a tight embrace, warmed something deep in her heart, something that had been cold and vacant for a long time.</p><p>This was love, being held and savored, cherished.</p> <p>Her heart expanded, all that warmth flooding her, filling her, easing her.</p><p>His hands stroked her wing-locks and she returned the favor. Her fingers grew wet as she went from one to the other, teasing and rubbing until he was firm against her body. She parted her legs so he could slide all that wonderful girth between her thighs.</p><p>\u201cSo, what did you have in mind?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Vela tried to remember, but now he had both hands on her ass and was pushing harder between her legs, arching his hips.</p><p>She drifted her hands over his shoulder and down his pecs, then her earlier idea came back to her. \u201cWait,\u201d she said. \u201cI remember now.\u201d She stepped away from him, took his hand and led him back to the bed. \u201cIn the center, on your back, please.\u201d He crawled and flopped, grabbing her arm and tugging in such a way that she fell on his chest.</p> <p>She came up laughing.</p><p>If the specter of the breh-hedden rose in her head to worry her, she repressed the thought. Right now, she had only one job, to enjoy her man.</p><p>She slid off of him and positioned herself on her knees beside him. \u201cYou have the most beautiful body,\u201d she said, letting her hands express all that she felt.</p><p>She fondled the hard muscles of his biceps, up to stroke his shoulders, then down to his pecs. She leaned over and swirled her tongue over his nipple, flicking fast. Without giving him warning, she released her fangs, struck, and at the same time, released the potion. His body jerked but she held him down.</p><p>He grunted. \u201cOh, shit, that feels good.\u201d She sucked him, just as he had sucked her. Using her other hand, she explored his abs, playing with his body, teasing his navel and slowly going south.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t have to go far until the crown of his cock was in her hand, his sturdy thickness causing her to throb deep between her legs.</p> <p>She shifted jobs and swung her body in the direction of his groin, sucked the head of his cock several times then switched back to his nipple.</p><p>His legs moved restlessly. She held his cock at the base and worked him just a little, teasing him, as she continued to suck his nipple. Every once in a while, she dipped her hand just a little lower and rolled his balls with her fingers.</p><p>He breathed hard and his head rolled on the sheet back and forth.</p><p>\u201cOh, God, the fire is moving down my chest.\u201d She could easily take him the distance, just like this, finishing him off with her mouth or even riding him.</p><p>But as she debated which to do, Samuel changed things up. He rose suddenly, which popped her mouth off his nipple. He slid his arm around her waist, turning her at the same time to flip her on her back so that he had her beneath him.</p><p>\u201cI need your blood.\u201d His eyes glinted in the moonlight. \u201cI need it now.\u201d She gave a cry, because she knew what this would mean, the pleasure that his fangs would give her again. There was nothing like donating blood. Or taking it.</p><p>Without preamble, she spread her legs and he entered her, gliding easily into her wetness. She took him in, surrounding his back with her arms and wrapping her legs around his thighs. Best sensation in the world.</p><p>He groaned heavily as she leaned up to sweep her hair away from her neck. He dipped down and licked her vein until it rose, which didn\u2019t take long.</p> <p>Vela. That\u2019s all he sent, then his fangs struck.</p><p>She shouted into the room. The pleasure was so intense, like a wave of touching all down her chest that kept flowing and repeating as he removed his fangs then sucked down her blood.</p><p>Her body clenched hard.</p><p>Vela, I\u2019m so close. The fire of your potion is almost to my cock, and I want this to be it. Can you be ready?</p><p>Yes. Give me your wrist. Completing t h e breh-hedden required a mutual exchange of blood, full on intercourse, then deep-mind engagement and she was so ready. All her nerves had eased up; Samuel had taken care of that.</p><p>He held his wrist over her mouth.</p><p>She licked and felt the veins rise. She struck quickly then formed a seal over the wound and began to drag his Samuel- flavored blood into her mouth.</p><p>All the sensations combined to send her into an altered state: the feel of his cock plunging steadily into her, his mouth sucking at her neck, drinking her blood, his powerful body moving over hers as she drank his blood down her throat.</p><p>Pleasure poured through her brain like a drug. She might have been moaning; she couldn\u2019t tell.</p><p>Your blood has hit my stomach. Oh, God, Vela, the power that\u2019s flowing. My grayle wants out and I\u2019m going to take us into the air.</p><p>She felt the levitation of both their joined bodies, surprised that the bed wasn\u2019t a necessary counter-friction as he continued to drive into her.</p><p>Power.</p><p>Samuel\u2019s Grayle power, as his body shed all that smoky mist, swirling around her, thickening his bitter chocolate scent.</p><p>She felt drunk on so many sensations.</p><p>I\u2019m going to enter your mind now, he sent.</p><p>Do it.</p><p>He pushed and her shields fell, or maybe they were already lying flat, just waiting for him to come to her.</p><p>Samuel had never been here before, suspended in the air, thrusting into a woman, sucking down her blood and with a potion in his groin readying him to fire off like a rocket. His grayle power had come online, giving force to his muscles as he pumped into Vela. He felt one with her and for the first time was truly at ease with his power.</p><p>But being inside Vela\u2019s mind shifted everything into a new gear that revved up his heart at the same time.</p><p>This was the full expression of love.</p><p>He was with the woman he loved, who had come to mean the sun, moon, and stars to him, who had taken him out of his darkness and brought him into the light.</p><p>Her mind was beautiful, full of goodness and worth, of kindness toward her friends and full acceptance of his warrior state. He felt whole and complete, well-loved, his body saturated with pleasure so that with each thrust he came closer to a serious explosion.</p><p>His balls were tight and ready, his cock hard and she tugged on him with every rock of her hips.</p><p>Now flow into my mind, he sent.</p><p>Let\u2019s take this thing all the way.</p><p>Yes. Her mind crossed back into his and at that moment, the breh-hedden struck like a gale force wind, pounding down on him and her, because her mind was within his and he could see all that she was experiencing. Her pleasure became his and his became hers.</p><p>The fire of her potion struck at the same time.</p><p>He drew back from her neck. His body arched. His orgasm burst through him and pleasure flowed like nothing he\u2019d known before. He shouted into the air and at the same time felt her own ecstasy streaking through her, exploding deep inside her well.</p><p>Her pleasure. His. Back and forth.</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d he shouted, because a second eruption took place and this time he writhed on her body. Somewhere he knew she was screaming as well, and pushing back against him.</p><p>Damn, Samuel. How you please me.</p><p>Damn.</p><p>Yes. Oh, God, Vela. But his mind could say no more than those few words.</p><p>His body felt on fire, into every muscle, tissue, and bone.</p><p>He continued to thrust and she kept pushing back at him, riding the immense wave of the breh-hedden. A third orgasm rushed out of him and once more he shouted and again she screamed as ecstasy flowed and pummeled and drove his sensations through her mind and hers through his, a complete and utter sharing.</p><p>When the last wave passed, and he settled his body against hers, as he took the levitation back down to the mattress, Samuel relaxed against her body. But he could feel what his cock felt like for Vela, within her well, what his hands felt like against her breast, his lips against her skin. All was a dual sensation, unending.</p><p>\u201cMy, God, Samuel. I could feel you come and it made my own orgasm so intense.</p><p>Oh, the pleasure you experienced.\u201d She stroked his head and kissed his neck.</p><p>He could do little more than lie there, taking it all in, relaxing maybe for the first time in his life. She was still in his mind, an extraordinary and peaceful presence, an easing of a hundred years of harsh, male living.</p><p>He sighed deeply.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re at ease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d Incredible.</p><p>\u201cI can feel what it\u2019s like for you to have your cock deep inside me. It\u2019s so male. A penetration, a conquering, and yet so much more.\u201d He chuckled. \u201cYes, it feels like that, like I\u2019ve done what a man is supposed to do.\u201d She kissed his neck again. \u201cI hope we get to do this a lot. Do you know that because of the breh-hedden, I can feel what my lips feel like against your skin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I can tell that the stubble right there, at my jaw-line, prickles your lips.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d She kept kissing him, small teasing bits of pressure against his cheeks and nose and finally his lips.</p><p>He kissed her for a long time, exchanging a dozen thoughts on what the breh-hedden felt like for each of them.</p><p>\u201cMore than anything,\u201d she said, drawing back and smoothing her hand over his cheek then pushing her fingers into his hair, \u201cI feel connected to you, very deeply. And I know you, how you think. I even saw some of what happened to you in Honduras, but the memories felt distant, even removed as though they existed in a former life.\u201d He met her beautiful blue gaze. \u201cIt was a former life. You\u2019ve come to me now, bringing this tremendous gift that joins us.\u201d She chuckled and kissed him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong. You brought this gift to me. I\u2019d set up a reclusive life for myself and you made me look at that, at my deepest truths. Maybe the breh-hedden brought us together, Samuel, but you showed me things that I\u2019d never wanted to look at before. No, you brought this gift to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel the same way about you.\u201d With that, he kissed her and because he caught her floral scent, still an enigma, and because he could feel the pleasure his cock gave her, he began to move once more inside her, rocking his hips in a rhythm as old as time. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Long after even Horace had declared Duncan\u2019s body fully recovered, Duncan remained in the hospital, lying on his side, unable to leave the trance-like state that had held him prisoner since his rescue.</p><p>Part of his mind functioned rationally; he knew when the nurses came and bathed him, when his friends approached his bed and spoke to him, and even when Rachel arrived and wept over him until her brother, Gideon, took her away.</p><p>Above all, Rachel caused the most distress. He\u2019d loved her for decades and had been her lover for part of that time.</p> <p>But Rachel held beliefs so different from his own that when neither would compromise, they\u2019d broken up permanently not long ago.</p><p>He wanted to give comfort and to explain, but he couldn\u2019t because a running film of images kept him trapped, in which a woman called to him almost continuously, sometimes singing to him, sometimes speaking in a low seductive voice, but always engaging his heart, like a powerful call to ascension.</p><p>The woman lived on Third Earth and needed him desperately. He had never seen such a beautiful woman before, her auburn hair in a beautiful curly mass around her face, cascading past her shoulders, her complexion glowing and pale, and her voice like an angel.</p><p>She told him that at exactly the right hour, he would rise from his bed and he would come to her, something he longed to do more than anything else in the world.</p><p>She had told him something else as well: that Rachel must die...</p> <p>A week later, Vela took a long look around at the exquisite Parisian opera house, an unusual and rather ornate place for a Warrior of the Blood induction ceremony. She sat in a box beside Madame Endelle, a place of honor, since all European Two royalty inhabited the remaining first tier boxes the entire distance from one side of the room to the other.</p><p>Jewels glittered and each tux in the theater no doubt represented every famous Mortal Earth or Second designer in two dimensions. Samuel had chosen Hugo Boss, even though Greaves\u2019s had favored him. All he\u2019d said, while adjusting his white cuffs was that he intended to change the future. As simple as that. \u201cBesides, why should Hugo Boss be punished for something that monster did?\u201d She\u2019d smiled as she smiled now.</p><p>The experience had become far easier than she\u2019d imagined because no one paid her the least attention. Why would they when she sat next to Endelle?</p><p>The Supreme High Administrator of Second Earth wore a turquoise sequined gown cut to her navel and split up each thigh mid-hip. A necklace of chunks of white crystals weighed down her chest.</p><p>But it was her headpiece that caught everyone\u2019s eye: a massive crown of peacock feathers backed by white ostrich feathers.</p><p>Vela loved it, the constant irreverence of Endelle\u2019s absurd fashions, the way she basically said, \u2018fuck off\u2019 with every turn of her head, every hard laughing cast of her eye in the direction of a disapproving royal.</p> <p>\u201cYou love this, don\u2019t you?\u201d Vela asked.</p><p>Endelle turned her head slowly, her strange wood-lined eyes meeting and holding Vela\u2019s gaze. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019ve learned to make do in a way that keeps your head straight.\u201d She nodded, the feathers sweeping back-and-forth with the slow movement.</p><p>\u201cYou have some understanding then, because you called it exactly right. We\u2019ll need their alliance in the future, these royals I mean. But I want you to see the truth, so watch what happens.\u201d She waved her hand in the direction of the audience, a more formal turn of her wrist than Vela would have expected from her.</p><p>Since all eyes were on Endelle anyway, a smattering of applause began, then more and more, until one after the other the audience rose to its feet, each person turned toward her, clapping vigorously.</p><p>Vela admitted she was surprised, and making use of her newly gained powers, she extended her senses and felt the truth that Madame Endelle wanted her to know: these people loved her and valued her, despite her absurdity.</p><p>Vela rose to her feet as well and added to the flow of admiration.</p><p>After a good long minute, Endelle waved her hands, indicating the ruckus should stop, and just as the last sound of applause died away, the lights dimmed.</p> <p>\u201cEndelle.\u201d Vela turned and gasped.</p><p>Braulio.</p><p>\u201cWell, where the fuck have you been?\u201d Endelle asked, keeping her voice low as the orchestra conductor took his place in the pit.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on my three-minute clock again, my sweet, on a new assignment and the council only allowed this one visit because I refused to take another step without at least talking to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Her voice much softer this time.</p><p>He reached toward her and put his hand on her shoulder. Leaning down from behind her chair, he kissed her once, then met her gaze. \u201cYou probably already know since you\u2019ve just felt the initial rumblings of trouble.\u201d He glanced at Vela, then back.</p><p>Endelle\u2019s shoulders sank low. \u201cThird is revving up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout ready to explode. We\u2019re in it again, but be patient.\u201d Endelle snorted. \u201cDo I have a choice about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo more than I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t stand up to the council?\u201d His gaze shifted away.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought.\u201d She sounded resigned.</p><p>He kissed her again and Vela leaned away, trying to give them some privacy but the chairs were smack dab together.</p><p>She focused on the film crews in three stations around the theater. When Endelle made mewling sounds, Vela concentrated on the beautiful mural of the Superstition Mountain monolith, with a starry night sky, that extended across the back of the stage. Apparently, Endelle had insisted that if she had to defer to those stick-up-their-butts that still called themselves European royalty in this modern age, then she wanted a mural of what she loved best about living in the desert.</p><p>When at last he pulled back, he apologized to Vela for being so rude.</p><p>To Endelle, he said, \u201cI\u2019ll come back to you as soon as I can.\u201d He started to lift his arm, and as though just remembering, he narrowed his gaze at Endelle. \u201cAnd you tell that asshole, Merl Tuttle, to stay away from you or by all Six dimensions, I\u2019ll cut off his jewels and feed them down his throat.\u201d Then he lifted his arm and vanished.</p><p>Vela put a hand over her mouth. The imagery alone had left her shaken.</p><p>She glanced at Endelle who blinked a couple of times then met Vela\u2019s gaze.</p><p>\u201cWell, that was a surprise.\u201d But a soft smile curved her lips.</p><p>The conductor lifted his arms, baton in hand, and a full orchestra started playing Holtz\u2019s \u2018Mars\u2019, a dynamic piece that reflected the extraordinary Warriors of the Blood.</p><p>All the What-Bees were present under one roof. Vela might have been worried about security, but Colonel Seriffe and his staff had the event well-in- hand and with Sharav dead and the Illinois Seers palace destroyed, Vela had confidence in the safety around her.</p><p>In addition, the women of obsidian flame, Fiona, Grace, and a very pregnant Marguerite, were on hand, ready to form their unusual triad of power. If any of the generals chose this night to attack, they\u2019d be in for it.</p><p>At all five Phoenix Metro Borderlands, Gideon had everything under control, having assigned twelve squads at each site. Though he battled at Warrior of the Blood level, both Luken and Seriffe wanted him to serve as Second-in- Command of the Militia Warriors, especially since, for the past year the Thunder God Warriors had served at the Borderlands in increasing numbers. And Gideon had always indicated his preference to remain at Apache Junction HQ.</p><p>As the music swelled and one by one, the warriors took the stage, the audience began to applaud until once more everyone had gained their feet. Vela didn\u2019t know which was louder: the applause or the music. Either way, chills ran up and down her arms and her heart filled with all the appreciation she felt for the sacrifices these men had made for centuries.</p><p>Kerrick led the way, with Alison on his arm.</p><p>Marcus followed with Havily.</p><p>Antony Medichi with Parisa.</p><p>Fiona, her pregnancy just announced, held tightly to Jean-Pierre\u2019s arm.</p><p>Thorne formed the apex at the top of the stage of the original nine, his arm around Marguerite\u2019s waist.</p><p>Leto came forward from the opposite side of the stage, Grace on his arm.</p><p>Luken after him, with Warrior Zacharius and finally, Santiago.</p><p>Wearing ceremonial black tunics, brass breastplates and capes with the right side flipped over the shoulder, the men looked like soldiers from ancient Rome.</p><p>They wore a sleeker version of battle sandals, with silver moldings and tight shin-guards.</p><p>Vela put a hand to her stomach and forced herself to breathe. The level of sheer preternatural power on the stage rolled over her, sending electric shocks through her system. She worked hard to keep tears tumbling down her cheeks, but they fell anyway.</p><p>What critical roles each played in the ongoing fate of Second Earth, now even more so, given the existence of an operational darkening grid that crossed the boundaries from Third to Second.</p><p>Braulio\u2019s comment had only confirmed what Vela already knew.</p><p>Vela, can you hear me?</p><p>Samuel\u2019s voice sounded sharp and crystal clear within her mind. Yes, what\u2019s going on?</p><p>Vela smiled as she continued to applaud and occasionally stamp her feet as many of the appreciative guests were doing, despite the formality of the occasion.</p><p>I want you with me, on stage. Simple as that and you can\u2019t say no. The other warriors have their brehs with them.</p><p>Vela gulped. But I don\u2019t belong up there. I haven\u2019t proven anything.</p><p>Fuck that. You saved Duncan\u2019s life.</p><p>You did.</p><p>We both helped and all the other women are here with their men. You don\u2019t get a choice on this one. I want you with me and once I\u2019m on stage, I will refuse to take any of the oaths until you\u2019re beside me.</p><p>The audience had started calling out something in a loud chant and it took Vela a few seconds to realize what they were saying. Even the orchestra had ceased playing because of it.</p><p>\u2018Samuel.</p><p>Samuel,\u2019 was being repeated over and over.</p><p>Do you hear that? They\u2019re calling for you.</p><p>That can\u2019t be.</p><p>He sounded astonished. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>This is for you alone, Samuel. This is your moment to be honored for your sacrifices and for your commitment to service. And you have to remember that Marcus sent out a thousand press releases, detailing your part in Duncan\u2019s rescue and about your grayle, Third Earth power. Like it or not, you\u2019re a celebrity.</p><p>A moment later, from the left side of the stage, Luken reappeared and waved at the crowd so that within a few seconds silence had fallen. But the energy among the spectators was as vibrant as ever so that the moment Luken said in a carrying voice, \u201cI give you Samuel Daman, of Phoenix Two, our candidate for confirmation,\u201d another round of applause swept the theater.</p><p>When Samuel didn\u2019t appear, Luken frowned and cocked his head as though listening.</p> <p>He nodded, clearly communicating telepathically with Samuel in the wings.</p><p>Luken\u2019s gaze then shifted to Vela and he held out his hand to her. All eyes shifted in her direction and the theater once more fell silent.</p><p>Heat crept up Vela\u2019s cheeks, just as Samuel\u2019s voice entered her head again.</p><p>I\u2019ve made a decision, my love. I\u2019m not doing this without you. We\u2019re a team.</p><p>Vela crumbled inside at his choice of words.</p> <p>We\u2019re a team, she sent back.</p><p>Because she knew Samuel so well, she understood the weight of these words, the depth of the meaning behind them.</p><p>Samuel had gone it alone his entire life, now he was joining the Warriors of the Blood and he saw their relationship as a team effort.</p><p>Endelle leaned over to her and said, \u201cWhat are you waiting for, ascender?</p><p>You\u2019ve been called. Now, go.\u201d Vela met Endelle\u2019s wooded eyes and saw her compassion, the thing that always surprised her about Endelle, that beneath her outrageous exterior, and way beyond her profane mouth, resided a woman of tremendous compassion.</p><p>Vela drew a deep breath and to Samuel, sent, I\u2019m ready.</p> <p>Go to Luken now.</p><p>Luken addressed the crowd once more. \u201cWe have a slight change of plans.</p><p>Candidate Samuel wishes his breh, Vela Stillwell to join him on stage. Please welcome Ascender Stillwell.\u201d One more fire-in-lungs breath and she simply levitated from her seat. Using a little added power, she kept her skirts of her gown fluttering close to her ankles as she moved swiftly to the stage, turning at the last moment to land beside Luken.</p><p>The tank-like warrior smiled down at her and winked. She returned his smile and felt herself relax a little, though her heart pounded in her chest.</p><p>The audience grew silent once more, expectant. Vela didn\u2019t care that thousands of people stared at her. Most knew who she was because Marcus had built her up as well, including her unusual darkening ability, so that in a small way she had her own celebrity status.</p><p>A certain degree of notoriety had come to her because of her darkening power, because of Duncan\u2019s rescue, and of course because of Samuel\u2019s elevation in rank.</p><p>She was a target now, just like all the women bonded to Warriors of the Blood, but so be it. She had become a woman of power, something she\u2019d never sought, but each day taught her more of what she possessed of strength and preternatural resources.</p><p>Applause resounded once more, this time for her. She inclined her chin a couple of times, but beyond that, she grew very still, and turned to glance once more at Madame Endelle, the compassionate scorpion of Second Earth. The woman smiled and nodded, her peacock and ostrich feathers waving along with her.</p> <p>Suddenly, Endelle\u2019s voice entered Vela\u2019s mind. You did good, ascender. You did good.</p><p>Warmth spilled through Vela\u2019s heart.</p><p>She marveled at all that had happened to bring her here, how hard she\u2019d resisted her course, and how much she\u2019d changed in just a handful of days. She valued Endelle\u2019s approval, the woman who had laid down her life for nine millennia, also with great resistance and unwillingness, but who had done it just the same.</p><p>She dipped her chin to Endelle, who dipped hers right back.</p><p>Vela smiled once more Luken\u2019s beautiful, resonant voice, addressed the audience one more. \u201cPlease join me in acknowledging the service of our candidate with warm applause as Warrior Samuel joins us.\u201d The moment Samuel appeared from the shadows of the curtains, applause thundered through the ornate theater once more. He paused for a moment to acknowledge the appreciation that flowed toward him, for his service as a Militia Warrior and probably more for having endured a decade of imprisonment and torture by a Third entity. He offered a short, slow bow. The applause rose to a peak with this gesture, then settled back down to mere thunder once more.</p><p>Samuel pivoted in Vela\u2019s direction.</p><p>Her own hands ached now from slamming them together with such force, but she didn\u2019t care. Tears brimmed in her eyes as he came toward her. But he didn\u2019t just take her arm, he took her in a warm embrace and to her mind sent, Oh, my darling Vela, how you saved me.</p><p>Vela\u2019s tears fell and more followed.</p><p>You did the same for me.</p><p>He held her for a long moment. When he finally released her, he took her arm, but kept her pinned to his side as he went through his induction.</p><p>The ceremony that followed became a blur of speeches made by Luken and Marcus, of ritual responses given by all the warriors that sent a profound and beautiful array of deep masculine voices into the theater, of oaths to serve Second Earth with all his might for the rest of his years as a Warrior of the Blood.</p><p>The ceremony concluded when Luken presented a new sword to Samuel, one that he took firmly by the grip. Holding it for a few long seconds, as the audience watched in silence, he forged the deadly identification signature.</p><p>Once complete, he held the sword aloft and another cheer resounded through the theater.</p><p>Two days after the confirmation, Samuel held Vela\u2019s hand and strolled beside her along a row of Scottsdale Two shops. One of them had caught Vela\u2019s eye and she perused the window display, head bent, eyes wide and seeking.</p><p>The door opened, a customer came out, and a familiar scent wafted beneath his nose arousing things that shouldn\u2019t be aroused in a public arena.</p><p>What the fuck?</p><p>He glanced through the door and saw that the place sold, among other things, scented candles. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going inside?\u201d Vela turned to him, blue eyes wide and hopeful.</p><p>He smiled. \u201cYes, but let me do this alone. There\u2019s something I want to see about.\u201d He knew she would want to come with him; her eyes had that let\u2019s-spend- some-money glint.</p><p>But she nodded and he went straight to the candles. It took him a bare split- second to locate the one that came damn close to Vela\u2019s scent. He lifted the lid of a candle in a jar and sniffed.</p><p>He barely repressed a groan.</p><p>He glanced at the label and smiled.</p><p>He even chuckled. But sniffing again, his pants shrunk. He liked this scent too damn much.</p><p>Putting the round glass lid back on the jar, he tucked it beneath one arm, them gathered up a bunch of small candles, called tea-lights or something. The latter appeared to require individual glass holders so he grabbed a bunch of those, too. He took deep breaths and named the planets starting nearest the sun to try to calm down.</p><p>By the time he\u2019d paid for his purchases and made it outside, he held the bag up to Vela and said, \u201cWe have to go home. Now. Sorry.\u201d She smiled, then sent, I guess we do because I can feel how your zipper is pressing into something that shouldn\u2019t be that big at least not out here in front of God and everybody. That, and you smell like a chocolate bar, which I\u2019m dying to take a bite out of.</p><p>He growled softly, took hold of her arm, and folded her straight to his bedroom.</p><p>She laughed as she sat down on the side of the bed. \u201cOkay, warrior, what\u2019s going on? And what on earth did you buy that got you so worked up?\u201d Damnit, he was a Warrior of the Blood, and buying candles in a woman\u2019s shop, just felt wrong. He handed her the bag and said, \u201cHere. This is for you, or maybe for me. Maybe for both of us. Hell, I don\u2019t know. Just take a look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, thank you? And...why do you look so mad?\u201d He rolled his eyes and waved his hand at the bag several times. \u201cIt\u2019s just so damn girlie.\u201d She opened it and pulled out the box of tea-lights. She sniffed, showed mild pleasure with a lift of her brows, then read the label. \u201cOh, sweet-peas. I know this flower. Everyone grew them on trellises when I was a kid.\u201d She then lifted her gaze to him.</p><p>He let her work it out, which made her laugh. \u201cThis is my scent. I smell like sweet-peas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. You do.\u201d But he wouldn\u2019t say anything more. He wouldn\u2019t say, You smell like sweet-peas, sweetheart. It was too fucking much.</p><p>\u201cWell, then,\u201d she said, her scent rising to compete with his purchases.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have to do something about these candles.\u201d He watched as she drew everything out of the bag. She opened the glass jar and set it on the night stand. She did the same for the tea-lights and the glass holders, placing them around the room.</p><p>Folding a lighter into her hand from the kitchen, she lit every single candle, then turned to him and started unbuttoning her blouse. Standing across the room, by the window, and in full daylight, she started stripping for him, slowly as the candles combined with her scent and flooded the room.</p><p>But by the time she\u2019d reached the last button, he\u2019d grown into a desperate state.</p><p>He panted and his shoulders hunched. He felt his grayle power itching to release.</p><p>He folded his shirt off and let the smoky mist rise around him.</p><p>Her lips parted and she gasped. \u201cI think this is taking too long.\u201d She waved her hand and poof, clothes gone. He growled and came at her fast, turning her toward the bed, plowing her backwards, and as he got her flat, he made his way inside her beautiful wetness.</p><p>That she laughed, cooed, and whimpered told him she didn\u2019t mind, not even a little. He made love to her briskly, barely two minutes of wild touching and pushing, before she arched beneath him, crying out, his body releasing into her in electric pulses of ecstasy.</p><p>They were definitely on their breh- moon.</p><p>She held him fast, her arms encircling his neck as she kissed him on his cheek, his forehead, his lips. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He spoke words of love and lust and heat and all that they were together.</p><p>He took her again, slower this time, bringing her to climax repeatedly until at last he spooned her and slept away the last of the afternoon.</p><p>He woke up as the sun sank low on the horizon, Vela and the beautiful mass of her hair, cradled against his chest. The peace he knew astounded him, the completeness, a sense of destiny fulfilled.</p> <p>When she moved and looked up at him, he smiled and kissed her. \u201cLooks like a beautiful sunset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShow me.\u201d He rose up from the bed and wrapped her in one of the sheets, laughing the whole time. He took her onto the balcony, and she leaned against his chest sighing contentedly.</p><p>Holding his woman in his arms was probably the best sensation he\u2019d ever known. \u201cI love you,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>She sighed again. \u201cI love you, too.</p><p>Now and forever.\u201d Now and forever.</p> <p>The desert, with all that dry earth, wind, and dust, made beautiful sunsets full of rich yellow, orange, and lavender hues, one of the beauties of the expansive Sonoran desert.</p><p>And he shared it now with Vela, his woman, his breh.</p><p>He marveled at life, at all the wealth that had come to him in just a few short weeks, of loving Vela, of knowing her deeply and intimately, of having her love him in return, and of starting this new life with her as a goddamn righteous Warrior of the Blood. </p> </body></html>"]
