It had started out as a town hall, back when the mining companies had a stake in the land, but those times had long since passed. Now it stood alone, withering away in the dark of night\u2014the sole lasting reminder that the area had once flourished.</p><p>What had been a place of assembly now held another gathering, one more sinister that seven-year-old Haven was learning about for the first time. Her legs shook and stomach churned as she followed her master into the building, staying on his heels but doing her best not to step on his shiny black shoes.</p> <p>They walked down a dark, narrow hall, passing a few men along the way. Haven kept her gaze on the floor, the sound of their voices as they greeted her master sending chills of fright down her back. These were new men, strangers, people she hadn\u2019t known existed.</p><p>He led her through a door at the end of the hallway, and what met them made her stop in her tracks. The stale scent of sweat and mildew saturated the room, heavy cigar smoke burning her nose. Masses of men stood around, talking loudly, as the sound of crying echoed off the walls, hitting the child like a freight train to the chest. She gasped, her heart racing as her eyes darted around looking for the source of the pain, but she couldn\u2019t see past the sea of bodies.</p><p>Her master grabbed hold of her, forcing her in front of him. She cringed as his hands clamped down on her shoulders and walked again at his command. The crowd parted for them, giving the two a clear path, and Haven obediently made her way to the front. She could feel the men staring, their eyes like lasers that burned down deep, making her blood boil as her face turned bright red.</p><p>In the front of the room, on a small stage, a few young girls knelt in a line. Tags were pinned to their ragged clothes, a number scribbled on it in black marker. Haven stood as still as possible, trying to ignore her master\u2019s touch, and watched as the crowd tossed money around. One by one the girls were auctioned off to the highest bidder, tears staining their cheeks as men dragged them away.</p><p>\u201cFrankie!\u201d</p> <p>Haven turned at the sound of her master\u2019s name and recoiled from the man approaching. His face was like cracked leather and mangled with scars, his eyes a blackened pit of coal. In her frightened mind, she mistook him for a monster.</p><p>Frankie tightened his grip on her, locking her in place as he greeted the man. \u201cCarlo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see you brought the girl,\u201d Carlo said. \u201cYou getting rid of her? Because if so\u2014\u201d</p><p>Frankie cut him off before he could finish. \u201cNo, I just thought it would do her some good to see her own kind.\u201d</p><p>Her own kind. The words fascinated Haven. She looked back at the stage as a new girl came out, a teenager who looked as if she\u2019d been in a fight with some scissors. Dozens of holes peppered her clothes, and her blonde hair was haphazardly chopped in a pixie cut. She was gagged and shackled, the number 33 affixed to her shirt.</p><p>Haven wondered\u2014Was she like her? Could they be the same?</p> <p>Number 33 struggled when the man gripped her arm, resisting more than the others. A split second changed everything as she pulled away, the metal binding her ankles making escape difficult. She jumped off the front of the stage and managed to stay on her feet, bolting for the crowd.</p><p>Chaos erupted like a volcano, violent and sudden. Men shouted, and Haven held her breath as Frankie reacted, his movement fluid as he reached into his coat and pulled out a gun. A shot exploded beside Haven, and she jumped, her ears ringing from the sudden bang. Number 33 dropped, the bullet ripping through her forehead and splattering Haven\u2019s blue-jean dress with fresh blood.</p><p>Hyperventilating, Haven\u2019s chest painfully heaved as she stared at the body on the floor by her bare feet. Blood streamed from the wound, soaking into the cracked wood and painting the girl\u2019s blonde hair a deep shade of red. Her icy blue eyes remained open, boring into Haven like they could see through her skin.</p><p>Frankie returned the gun to his coat and bent down to Haven\u2019s level. She tried to turn away from the carnage, but he gripped the back of her neck and forced her to look at Number 33.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what happens when people forget their place,\u201d he said, his voice as cold as the dead eyes she stared into. \u201cRemember that.\u201d</p><p>He stood, resuming his earlier position as he clutched her shoulders. The auction continued as if nothing had happened\u2014as if an innocent girl weren\u2019t slain in front of them all. Number 33 lay lifeless on the floor, and no one in the room gave her a second thought.</p><p>No one, that is, except Haven. The vision of it would haunt her forever.</p><p>TEN YEARS LATER . . .</p> <p>1</p><p>The hot, dry air burned Haven\u2019s chest. She gasped, struggling to breathe, as the dust kicked up by her frantic feet made it hard for her to see. It wasn\u2019t as if it would help anyway, since it was pitch black out and she had no idea where she was. Everything appeared the same in every direction, nothing but desert all around.</p><p>Her feet felt like they were on fire as every muscle in her body screamed for her to stop. It grew harder and harder to continue with each step, her strength deteriorating as her adrenaline faded. A bang rang out, her footsteps faltering as she swung in the direction of the noise, spotting a faint glow of light in the distance. A house.</p><p>She darted toward it, trying to yell for help but no sound escaped her throat. Her body revolted against her, giving out when she needed it most. The light grew brighter the harder she ran until all she saw was a flash of white. Blinded, she tripped and collapsed to the ground, pain running through her in waves as the light surrounding her burned out entirely.</p><p>The basement was dark and damp, the only exit a set of metal doors locked with heavy chains. With no windows, it was sweltering, the air polluted with the stench of sewer. Dried blood tinged the concrete floor like old splatters of red paint, a grotesque canvas of prolonged misery.</p><p>Haven lay in the corner, her frail body unmoving, except for the subtle rise and fall of her chest. Her long brown hair, usually somewhat frizzy, was so matted it appeared only half its length. By society\u2019s standards, she was as sickly as they come. Jutting collarbones and limbs like twigs, her ribs could be counted through her bruised and bloodied skin. She thought herself to be healthy, though. She\u2019d seen people worse than her before.</p><p>The day had begun like every other. Haven woke up at dawn and spent most of the morning cleaning. In the afternoon she spent some time with her mama, the two of them sitting against the side of the old wooden house. Neither spoke as the sound of the television filtered out of an open window above them. The news told of a hurricane brewing in the south and a war waging in Iraq, the significance of both lost on Haven.</p><p>Her mama said listening to it was a waste of time, because their slice of the world was barely a blip on the big radar, but Haven couldn\u2019t help herself. The five o\u2019clock news was the highlight of her day. She needed to feel like she was real, that something\u2014or someone\u2014she\u2019d had contact with still existed out in the world, somewhere.</p><p>Screaming started inside the house, interrupting the news as fighting made its way into the living room. Haven climbed to her feet, not wanting to be caught eavesdropping, when she heard something that stopped her in her tracks. \u201cI want the girl gone!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, Katrina! I\u2019m working on it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot hard enough!\u201d Katrina was the lady of the house, a harsh woman with short black hair and wickedly pointy features. \u201cGet rid of her already!\u201d</p><p>Get rid of her already. The words suffocated Haven. The fighting moved from the living room to upstairs, their voices fading as tense silence crept in.</p><p>She was in serious trouble.</p><p>\u201cThis world\u2019s scary,\u201d her mama whispered. \u201cPeople will hurt you. They\u2019ll do things to you, sick things . . . the kind of things I hope you never know about. And they\u2019ll trick you. They\u2019ll lie to you. You have to be on guard at all times, baby girl.\u201d</p><p>Haven didn\u2019t like where the conversation was going. \u201cWhy are you telling me this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you need to know,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have to run.\u201d</p><p>Haven stared at her in disbelief. \u201cRun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, tonight. There\u2019s more to life than this, and I\u2019m afraid of what will happen if you stay here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I can\u2019t run, Mama. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s out there!\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople out there can help you.\u201d</p><p>Tears formed in Haven\u2019s eyes. \u201cI can\u2019t leave you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the only way,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have to get away from here, find someone and tell them who you are. They\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSave you?\u201d Haven asked, finishing her sentence. \u201cWill they come here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d Something sparked in her eyes. Hope?</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll do it,\u201d Haven said, \u201cfor you.\u201d</p><p>After nightfall, when Haven thought no one would look for her until morning, she quietly slipped away. She ran for the world outside of the ranch, determined to find help so she\u2019d never have to return.</p><p>Waking up in the musty basement, she realized she\u2019d failed.</p><p>A clanking jolted Haven awake, a blinding light assaulting her. Cringing, she noticed the doors open and someone standing a few feet away. A man with olive skin approached, his dark hair slicked back on his head. He wore black pants and a white button-up shirt, the sleeves rolled up to his elbows. Haven gaped at the silver gun holstered to his belt.</p><p>Her voice cracked. \u201cAre you the police?\u201d</p><p>The man knelt near her, setting a small black bag on the floor. He didn\u2019t answer but gave her a bemused smile as he pressed his large palm to her forehead.</p><p>Haven closed her drowsy eyes and got lost in the silence until the man finally spoke. She opened her eyes again, surprised by his gentle tone, but recoiled when she met a hostile glare.</p><p>Behind the stranger stood someone she knew well. Michael, or Master as he preferred to be called, scowled at her with his dark eyes, the whites of them dingy yellow. His lip was curled in a sneer, his wiry hair graying around the ears.</p><p>\u201cRelax, child,\u201d the stranger said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be all right.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him, wondering if she could believe it, and panicked when he pulled a needle out of his bag. She whimpered, trying to move away, but he grabbed her and jabbed it into her shoulder blade.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to hurt you,\u201d he said, letting go and handing the offending little weapon to Michael. \u201cI\u2019m only trying to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelp?\u201d Her mama had told her people out there would help, but she\u2019d also warned her that some of them would lie. Haven wasn\u2019t sure which group this man fell in to, but she leaned toward the latter.</p><p>\u201cYes, help.\u201d The man stood. \u201cYou need to rest. Save your energy.\u201d</p><p>He walked away, and her master followed him without saying a word. Haven lay there, too drained to make sense of it, and her eyes closed when she heard their voices again.</p><p>\u201cShe looks horrible!\u201d the man yelled, all trace of kindness gone. \u201cHow could you let this happen, Antonelli?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean for it to,\u201d Michael said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know she\u2019d try to run!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThis started before yesterday, and you know it! You should\u2019ve been watching her!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should be.\u201d Haven started to slip away, but before sleep took her, the man spoke once more. \u201cI\u2019ll give you what you want for her, but I\u2019m not happy about this. At all.\u201d</p><p>Haven awoke later, still on the concrete floor. Every inch of her ached, and she grimaced as she struggled to sit up. A throat cleared nearby, the stranger once again standing in the basement with her. \u201cHow do you feel?\u201d</p> <p>She wrapped her arms protectively around herself as he moved toward her. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>His voice was calm but firm. \u201cThe truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSore,\u201d she reluctantly admitted. \u201cMy head hurts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not surprised.\u201d He knelt down and reached toward her, the movement making her flinch. \u201cI\u2019m not going to hit you, child.\u201d</p><p>He felt her forehead and grasped her chin, surveying her face. \u201cDo you know who I am?\u201d She shook her head, although something about him struck her as familiar. She thought she might\u2019ve seen him from a distance before, one of the visitors she\u2019d been kept away from throughout the years. \u201cI\u2019m Dr. Vincent DeMarco.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDoctor?\u201d They\u2019d never gotten medical attention before, even for the severest of problems.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m a doctor,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I\u2019m also an associate of the Antonellis. I arrived after you went missing. You suffered a minor concussion, and you\u2019re dehydrated, but there\u2019s no permanent damage that I can see. You\u2019re lucky you were found. You could\u2019ve died out there.\u201d</p><p>A sinking feeling settled into the pit of Haven\u2019s stomach, a small part of her wishing she would have. It had to be better than being killed at the hands of a monster.</p><p>Dr. DeMarco looked at his watch. \u201cDo you think you can walk? We should leave soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you\u2019re going to be staying with me now.\u201d</p> <p>She shook her head, cringing as her pain intensified. \u201cI can\u2019t leave my mama. She needs me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should\u2019ve thought about that before you ran away.\u201d</p><p>She tried to explain, her words sluggish. \u201cThey were going to kill me. I didn\u2019t have a choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou always have a choice, child,\u201d he said. \u201cIn fact, you have one right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re giving me a choice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I am. You can come with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cOr you stay here, and I\u2019ll leave without you. But before you decide, tell me something. You ran away because you thought they were going to kill you. What do you think they\u2019ll do to you now?\u201d</p> <p>She stared at her dirt-caked feet. \u201cSo I either go with you or I die? What kind of choice is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne I suppose you won\u2019t like making,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it is a choice, nonetheless.\u201d</p><p>Tense silence brewed between them. Haven didn\u2019t like this manipulating man. \u201cWhat do you want me for?\u201d</p><p>She was used to being punished for speaking out of turn, but she had nothing to lose. What would he do, kill her?</p><p>\u201cI never said I wanted you, but I\u2019m a busy man. I can use someone to cook and clean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t pay someone?\u201d She regretted the question immediately and backtracked. \u201cAt least it would be legal. I think this is illegal. Isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Truthfully, she wasn\u2019t sure.</p><p>\u201cI suppose it technically is, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>Before he could finish, shouts rang out above them in the house. Haven flinched at the loud thump and startled cry, tears stinging her eyes when she realized Michael was hurting her mama.</p><p>Dr. DeMarco sighed. \u201cLook, I\u2019m not going to wait around all night waiting for you. If you don\u2019t want my help, so be it. Stay here and die.\u201d</p><p>The man stood to leave. Haven climbed to her feet, muttering, \u201cWhy me?\u201d She wanted to believe there was a point to it all, but she wasn\u2019t sure anymore.</p><p>He gave a slight shake of the head. \u201cI wish I knew.\u201d</p><p>The soles of Haven\u2019s feet burned as Dr. DeMarco led her out of the basement. \u201cI\u2019m not chasing you if you run,\u201d he said, laughing bitterly when her panicked eyes darted to his gun. \u201cI\u2019m not going to shoot you, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll shoot your mother instead.\u201d</p><p>She gasped as he let go of her arm. \u201cPlease don\u2019t hurt her!\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay where you are and I won\u2019t have to,\u201d he said, walking away.</p><p>Although her legs were weak and she felt dizzy, Haven refused to move an inch as he disappeared inside the house. The sky glowed bright orange as the sun dipped below the horizon, casting distorted shadows along the ground in front of her. She didn\u2019t know what day it was, had no clue how much time had passed. She scanned what she could see of the property, searching for some sign of her mama. She wanted to call out to her, to find her. She wanted to ask what she was supposed to do.</p><p>But her mama never appeared. The sun disappeared, and out of the darkness came Dr. DeMarco again. He didn\u2019t look at her as he opened a door to a black car. \u201cTime to go.\u201d</p><p>Timidly, Haven slid into the rigid passenger seat and peered around as he slammed the door. The harsh stench of fresh leather in the confined space made her feel like a weight was pressing on her chest. She had trouble breathing, struggling to stay calm when he climbed in beside her. Dr. DeMarco frowned as he reached into the backseat for his bag. He pulled out another needle and stuck her without a word.</p><p>Blackness came again.</p><p>The small road cut through the dense forest, the painted lines so faded it appeared made for one car. A new highway diverted traffic from the area, so the only people who navigated there were locals and those who lost their way. Haven lay slumped over in the passenger seat of a car, woozy as she watched the trees whipping past in the darkness. She turned from the window, fighting sickness. Her eyes found the clock on the dashboard, the numbers glowing a quarter after twelve.</p><p>She\u2019d been out for hours.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to sedate you for so long,\u201d Dr. DeMarco said, noticing her movement. \u201cYou slept the entire flight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn an airplane?\u201d He nodded. It was her first time even being near a plane. She wasn\u2019t sure whether to be glad it was over or disappointed she\u2019d missed it. \u201cWhere are we now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost home.\u201d</p><p>Home. Haven didn\u2019t know what that meant.</p><p>\u201cBefore we get there, I want to make something clear,\u201d Dr. DeMarco said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have some normalcy living with us, but don\u2019t mistake my kindness for weakness. I expect your loyalty, and if you betray my trust in any way, there will be consequences. As long as you remember that, we won\u2019t have any problems.\u201d He paused. \u201cI want you to be comfortable with us, though, so you can speak freely as long as you\u2019re respectful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d never disrespect you, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever say never. Sometimes we don\u2019t realize when we\u2019re being disrespectful.\u201d Haven wondered what he meant by that, but he didn\u2019t explain. \u201cDo you have any questions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said \u2018us.\u2019 Do you have a family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. I have two sons, ages seventeen and eighteen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She was on the verge of panicking. She hadn\u2019t been around many people her age and had never had any contact with teenage boys. Studying him, she noticed the plain gold band gleaming under the moonlight on his left hand. Married. \u201cAnd your wife, sir? Their mama?\u201d</p><p>The moment the question came from her lips, Dr. DeMarco\u2019s demeanor shifted. His posture stiffened and his jaw clenched as he stared straight ahead, his foot pressing harder on the gas pedal. He gripped the steering wheel so tightly his knuckles turned as white as bone, conversation ceasing.</p><p>So much for speaking freely.</p><p>The car turned off the pavement and drove down a bumpy path that cut through the dense trees. They came to a clearing, and Haven gaped at the house that came into sight. The old plantation home stood three stories high, with columns spanning the height of the structure. The white paint was faded, tinting the exterior a dull gray. A large porch wrapped around the first floor, with smaller ones running the lengths of the second and third.</p><p>Dr. DeMarco parked between a smaller black car and a silver one, and Haven stepped out cautiously, taking in her surroundings. All she could see in the darkness beyond were trees, while a porch light made the gravel faintly visible beneath her feet. Dr. DeMarco grabbed his luggage before heading toward the front door, and she limped behind with empty hands, having nothing of her own to carry. She\u2019d never had much, all of her clothes ragged hand-me-downs that she\u2019d left behind without a choice.</p><p>After stepping onto the porch, Dr. DeMarco pressed his finger to a small panel on a rectangular keypad. It beeped before he opened the door. Haven stepped into the house, pausing as he closed the door and punched something into an identical keypad on the inside.</p><p>A green light flashed as a lock clicked into place, the door automatically securing itself. \u201cIt\u2019s wired into a computer network,\u201d Dr. DeMarco explained. \u201cThe house is impenetrable, the glass bulletproof and windows nailed shut. You need a code or fingerprint authorization to get in or out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happens if there\u2019s a power failure, sir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s on a backup generator.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if the generator doesn\u2019t work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I suppose you\u2019ll stay locked inside until power\u2019s restored.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill I have a code?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe someday, when I feel I can trust you with one,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter what you pulled in Blackburn, I\u2019m sure you can understand my position. I\u2019m a lot closer to civilization than they were.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t understand his position, refused to try. \u201cWhat happens if there\u2019s an emergency?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are ways around the system, but I don\u2019t foresee any situations that require you to know those tricks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what if there\u2019s a fire and I need to get out?\u201d</p><p>Dr. DeMarco gazed at her. \u201cYou\u2019re a crafty one, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Before she could respond, he turned away. \u201cI\u2019ll show you around.\u201d</p><p>Straight in front of them was the family room, with several couches and a television on one of the walls. A fireplace was tucked in the back beside a piano, the wooden floor shining from the glow of the moon streaming through the large windows. To the left was a kitchen filled with stainless-steel appliances, an island in the center with pots and pans hanging above it. The dining room behind that had the longest table Haven had ever seen, big enough to accommodate fourteen. She wondered how often all those seats were taken, unable to imagine cooking for that many people. To the right were a bathroom and a laundry room, as well as an office tucked underneath the staircase.</p><p>The second floor belonged to Dr. DeMarco\u2014a bedroom and a bathroom, along with another office and a spare room. Some of the doors had keypads beside them, a sign Haven wouldn\u2019t be going into those rooms. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They continued up to the third floor, the stairs ending in a large open space. A window lined the back wall, in front of it stood a table with two plush gray chairs. The other three walls held doors leading to bedrooms, but the area itself was packed full of bookcases. Hundreds of dusty books lined the shelves. Haven stared in shock, having never dreamed of seeing so many before.</p><p>\u201cOur library,\u201d Dr. DeMarco said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t get much use and I imagine it still won\u2019t, considering Antonelli said you couldn\u2019t read.\u201d</p><p>Haven could feel his eyes on her, but she remained quiet and didn\u2019t meet his gaze.</p><p>A door opened nearby and a boy stepped out from one of the bedrooms. He was tall and lanky, with shaggy brown hair. Dr. DeMarco turned to him. \u201cDominic, this is, uh . . . She\u2019s going to be staying here.\u201d</p> <p>Dominic eyed her curiously. \u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, sir,\u201d she said, her voice shaky.</p><p>His laughter echoed through the room. \u201cOh, that won\u2019t do. Just call me Dom.\u201d</p><p>Dom headed downstairs as Dr. DeMarco led her across the library, striding past the middle door without a word and stopping at the last. \u201cThis is where you\u2019ll sleep. Go in. I\u2019ll be back.\u201d</p><p>Haven hesitantly stepped inside. The furniture, the curtains, and the carpet were all plain, everything a dull white with dustings of wood. Most of the house held the same effect, the walls empty and rooms uncluttered. There were no pictures and no knick-knacks, nothing to hold any sentimental value. Nothing to give her any idea of what type of people she was dealing with.</p> <p>She still stood just inside the doorway when Dr. DeMarco returned with a pile of clothes. \u201cThey\u2019ll be big, but at least they\u2019re clean.\u201d</p><p>She took them. \u201cThank you, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d he said. \u201cGet cleaned up and settle in. This is your home now, too.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d said it again. Home. She had lived with the Antonellis her entire life and never heard it referred to as home.</p><p>Dr. DeMarco walked away but stopped after a few steps. \u201cOh, and help yourself to anything in the kitchen if you\u2019re hungry, but don\u2019t try to burn down my house. Doing so won\u2019t get you a code any faster. I\u2019ll let you burn to death before I let you outsmart me.\u201d</p><p>Haven ran her hand along the fluffy comforter. She\u2019d never had a bed before, much less a bedroom of her own. Her nights in Blackburn had been spent in the stables, in a back stall on a worn-down mattress with some of the springs exposed. The temperature was comfortable there at night, so she hadn\u2019t had much use for blankets, one of the ratty covers they kept for the horses enough for the occasions it did get cold. She preferred not to use them, because they were itchy on her skin, nothing like the material against her fingertips now.</p> <p>After stripping out of her old clothes, Haven went into the connecting bathroom. A large tub sat in the corner with a long counter and a sink across from it, a rectangular mirror on the wall above the sink.</p><p>Hesitantly, Haven surveyed her reflection, her sunken cheeks and the cuts covering her face. A bruise ran along the right side of her jaw while blood caked her hairline from a gash in her forehead.</p><p>It was like a layer of dirt had settled on her body, tinting her skin a slightly darker shade, but it wasn\u2019t enough to cover her scars. There were dozens she could see and even more on her back, constant reminders of what she\u2019d been through. The bruises faded and sometimes so did the memories, but the scars . . . the scars remained.</p><p>She drew a bath and slid into it, hissing as the scalding water came into contact with her skin. She scrubbed every inch of her body raw as tears pooled in her eyes, overwhelmed and unsure about what would come of her. Dr. DeMarco had been civilized, but she wasn\u2019t fooled by his gentle voice and small tokens of independence. Nothing came without a price. While Dr. DeMarco might not have looked like a monster, she wasn\u2019t na\u00efve enough to believe one didn\u2019t live inside of him, lurking under the surface.</p><p>Experience told her one always did.</p><p>She got out after the water cooled and found a towel in a small cabinet. It smelled like flowers and was soft against her skin as she wrapped it around her body. Heading back into the bedroom, she grabbed the clothes and slipped on the black flannel pants. They hung limp on her frail form, and she had to roll them up to keep them in place. She grabbed a white t-shirt and unfolded it, noticing the football on the front. Turning it over, she flinched at the big black number 3 covering the back.</p><p>Time passed slowly as sleep evaded Haven. She huddled under the blanket, trying to find comfort, but the stillness was unsettling. It was too new, too foreign. A prickly sensation crept across her skin as the walls closed in on her, hunger and anxiety taking its toll.</p><p>In the early morning hours, it got to be too much, and she quietly slipped downstairs. The hallways were dark, but she noticed a subtle glow of light in the kitchen. Tiptoeing to the doorway, she peeked inside and saw a boy in front of the refrigerator. He was a few inches taller than her, his skin the color of coffee with a lot of extra cream. A few days\u2019 worth of stubble accented his sharp features, and his thick hair was dark, shorter on the sides than on the top. His gray shirt hugged his chest, the short sleeves shoved up to his shoulders. Ink marked his right arm, a tattoo she couldn\u2019t make out in the darkness, and he had on a pair of pants identical to the ones she wore.</p> <p>He drank juice from a glass, unaware of her presence, and Haven took a step back to flee. The movement caught his eye, and he turned in her direction, the drink slipping from his hand when he spotted her. It hit the floor and shattered, the spray of liquid soaking his pants.</p><p>Jumping back, he looked down at himself. \u201cShit!\u201d</p><p>The curse sent Haven into a panic, and she darted forward to clean up the mess. He bent down at the same moment Haven dove to his feet, their heads colliding. The force knocked him backward, a piece of jagged glass stabbing him when he caught himself on the floor. He cursed again as blood oozed from the small gash and stuck his wounded thumb into his mouth. She noticed, as she looked at him, a scar running through his right eyebrow, slicing it in half.</p><p>His gaze lifted, a pair of vibrant green eyes greeting Haven, intense passion swirling in the color that took her breath away. She broke eye contact, her chest tightening as she snatched a towel from the counter to clean up the juice. Tears streamed down her cheeks as she pushed the glass into a pile, but she was disrupted when his hand seized her wrist. She yelped at the zap of static electricity, and he blinked rapidly, just as caught off guard.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d he asked, gripping her tightly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said. \u201cPlease don\u2019t punish me.\u201d</p><p>Before either could get out another word, the overhead light flicked on and Dr. DeMarco\u2019s harsh voice rang out. \u201cLet her go!\u201d</p><p>The boy dropped her wrist so fast it was as if he\u2019d been savagely burned. \u201cSorry,\u201d he said, the word barely audible as he climbed to his feet.</p><p>Haven struggled to breathe as Dr. DeMarco poured a glass of water from the faucet and handed it to her. \u201cDrink,\u201d he commanded. She forced the water down and gagged, her stomach more interested in expelling its contents. \u201cWhat happened here?\u201d</p><p>They replied at the same time, answering in sync. \u201cIt was an accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t happen again, sir,\u201d Haven continued. \u201cI swear.\u201d</p><p>Dr. DeMarco blinked a few times. \u201cIt\u2019s not often two people accept blame around here.\u201d</p><p>As if on cue, the boy spoke again. \u201cYeah, well, it wasn\u2019t really my fault. She scared me. She\u2019s a fucking ninja or something.\u201d</p><p>Dr. DeMarco pinched the bridge of his nose. \u201cWatch your mouth, son. Go get ready for school.\u201d</p><p>He started to argue, but Dr. DeMarco\u2019s hand shot up to silence him. The sudden movement startled Haven. She recoiled, bracing to be struck.</p><p>The boy eyed her strangely. \u201cWhat the hell\u2019s wrong with\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said go!\u201d Dr. DeMarco said. \u201cI don\u2019t have time for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, what-the-fuck-ever.\u201d</p><p>Dr. DeMarco turned to her after the boy stormed out. \u201cHe isn\u2019t usually . . . well, never mind; that\u2019s a lie. He is usually like this. He\u2019s finicky and angry, but that\u2019s neither here nor there. He\u2019s set in his ways, and it doesn\u2019t matter what I do. Carmine is who he is.\u201d</p><p>Carmine. A strange name for a strange boy.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you up, anyway?\u201d he asked. \u201cI figured you\u2019d sleep most of the day to recover.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know what time I was supposed to get up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou get up whenever you get up,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can go back to bed now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what about\u2014?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t let her finish. \u201cI\u2019ll handle this. Don\u2019t worry about doing anything today. Just rest.\u201d</p><p>2</p><p>\u201cI need a favor.\u201d</p><p>Carmine stepped past his father, refusing to acknowledge he\u2019d spoken. The scent of freshly brewed coffee was strong in the kitchen as Vincent cleaned the sticky mess from the floor. The knees of his newest Armani suit were soaked with juice, and Carmine got a tiny bit of satisfaction from that fact.</p><p>\u201cAre you ignoring me now, son?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, are you talking to me? I thought you didn\u2019t have time for me this morning.\u201d</p><p>Vincent stood. \u201cI certainly don\u2019t have time for your attitude, but I do need a favor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you do.\u201d</p><p>Vincent pulled a piece of paper out of his pocket and handed it to him. \u201cAsk Dia if she\u2019ll grab this stuff after school today. I\u2019d do it myself, but I know nothing about things teenage girls need.\u201d</p><p>Carmine laughed. \u201cI don\u2019t think Dia knows shit about teenage girls, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe knows enough,\u201d he said. \u201cJust do it.\u201d</p><p>Carmine shoved it into his pocket. \u201cWhatever. Is it for the ninja girl? Who is she, anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you honestly care?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The word came out before he gave it any thought. He wasn\u2019t sure what to think.</p><p>\u201cThen it doesn\u2019t matter who she is,\u201d Vincent said. \u201cBut she needs things, so don\u2019t forget to ask Dia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard you the first time,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would\u2019ve been nice to have some warning you were bringing someone here, though. Where\u2019d she come from?\u201d</p><p>Vincent poured some coffee into his silver travel mug. \u201cI thought you didn\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen again\u2014it doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d he said. \u201cAll that matters is she\u2019s here now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d Vincent mimicked him, shaking his head. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to see the money I paid to send you to Benton Academy made you more articulate.\u201d</p><p>Carmine shuddered at the mention of that place.</p><p>He\u2019d landed in trouble the year before\u2014trouble that could have ruined his life\u2014but his father had pulled some strings to get him out of it. He hadn\u2019t exactly been forgiving, though, and had shipped him to a boarding school across the country for a semester. Carmine swore the moment he was on the plane heading home that nothing like it would happen again, but it was a lot easier said than done. He never went looking for it, but trouble found him every time he turned a corner. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And Carmine turned a lot of motherfucking corners.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, you should\u2019ve saved your pennies. Your life would be easier if you would\u2019ve let me rot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet you truly believe that,\u201d Vincent said, glancing at his watch. \u201cI have to get cleaned up for work. Just remember to ask Dia\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already said I heard you. How many times are you going to remind me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUntil I know you won\u2019t forget.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause if you do, we\u2019re going to have a problem.\u201d</p><p>Dia Harper drove an old Toyota, slate gray and missing two hubcaps. She\u2019d bought it with money she earned freelancing, which meant she\u2019d do nearly anything for a few bucks. Shopping, cleaning, passing messages . . . She\u2019d even written a term paper for Carmine for fifty dollars once. A leak in the exhaust system made the car emit strong gas fumes that she tried to cover with a dozen tree-shaped air fresheners. Carmine wouldn\u2019t be caught dead riding in it, but to Dia, the car was the Holy Grail.</p><p>She was perched on the hood of it in the parking lot that morning when Carmine arrived at school. \u201cI still don\u2019t get it,\u201d she said, shaking her head as soon as he stepped out. \u201cExplain it again.\u201d</p> <p>Carmine leaned against his black Mazda in the spot beside her. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to get. It is what it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSex,\u201d he said, laughing at the bewildered expression on Dia\u2019s face. Her blue eyes were hidden beneath layers of dark makeup, and she\u2019d added some pink and purple streaks to her short blonde hair since yesterday. She defined eccentric in her mismatched clothes, her new bulky camera hanging by a strap around her neck. Nothing about Dia conformed, which was what had drawn Carmine to her in the first place. Although he was popular, there weren\u2019t many people he considered friends. He felt there were two types of people in the small town of Durante, North Carolina, where they lived\u2014those who wanted him, and those who wished they could be him. Dia was different, though. She was honest and, living in a world surrounded by nothing but lies, Carmine appreciated that.</p><p>\u201cBut why Lisa?\u201d Dia asked, refusing to drop the subject.</p><p>Carmine looked across the parking lot at where a group of girls had gathered and shrugged when he spotted Lisa Donovan. She had long blonde hair, her body slim and skin darkly tanned. She looked like every other girl in school\u2014nothing to write home about.</p><p>Not that there was anyone at his home who gave a shit about his life . . .</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s quick to get naked. Less work for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGross.\u201d Dia wrinkled her nose. \u201cYou need a decent girl to straighten you out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need straightened out,\u201d Carmine said. \u201cWhy drown in love when you can have so much fun swimming around in lust?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut her?\u201d Dia pressed. \u201cOut of everyone in this school, you pick Moanin\u2019 Lisa.\u201d</p><p>Carmine chuckled, tugging on a chunk of Dia\u2019s colorful hair. \u201cLooks like you\u2019re the painting today, Warhol.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019ll take it,\u201d she said. \u201cAndy Warhol was one of the best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe, but he was still a genius.\u201d She nodded toward the group of girls. \u201cWhich Moanin\u2019 Lisa, clearly, is not. I don\u2019t think she can even string together a sentence. Have you tried to have an intelligent conversation with her? It\u2019s like talking to a brick wall.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, we don\u2019t do a lot of talking,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s not so bad from behind with her face shoved into a mattress, though.\u201d</p><p>Dia shook her head as Carmine laughed again. He had no real interest in Lisa, or any other girl for that matter. But while a relationship was the furthest thing from his mind, he\u2019d realized there were benefits to keeping female company. They might not have been intellectually stimulating, but they did stimulate another part of him . . . often.</p><p>A silver Audi whipped into the parking lot then, coming to a stop beside them. Dominic hopped out from behind the wheel and Tess, his girlfriend, climbed from the passenger seat. Tess was Dia\u2019s twin sister, but the two couldn\u2019t have been more opposite.</p><p>They\u2019d all known one another since they moved to the area in elementary school, but the relationship between Dominic and Tess was new. It was strange\u2014the life Carmine had left wasn\u2019t the same one he\u2019d returned to, and he had a hard time adjusting to the change.</p><p>\u201cWhat are y\u2019all up to?\u201d Dominic asked.</p><p>\u201cTrying to get Carmine to see the error of his ways when it comes to Lisa,\u201d Dia said. \u201cIt\u2019s not working.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t say I\u2019m surprised,\u201d Tess said. \u201cNo girl with an ounce of self-respect would want him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not that bad. I\u2019m rich, popular. I have a sense of humor. I\u2019m good looking, and not to mention I have a really big\u2014\u201d They all groaned loudly before he could finish. He shrugged, thinking he\u2019d summed himself up nicely. \u201cBesides, it\u2019s not like I plan to date her. The only time you\u2019ll catch me asking a girl out is after I\u2019m done with her, and I\u2019m asking her to get out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee, that\u2019s why you\u2019ll always be alone,\u201d Tess said. \u201cYou only think about yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo says the vainest bitch alive,\u201d he said. \u201cYou better be careful throwing stones in your glass house, Tess. You\u2019re liable to get cut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough, you two,\u201d Dominic said, stepping between them. \u201cCarmine\u2019s free to do whatever\u2014or whomever\u2014he wants, so get off his back. But, bro, you better watch yourself, threatening my girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t threaten her. I warned her. She ought to thank me.\u201d</p><p>Rolling her eyes, Tess stalked off, and Dominic followed behind, calling her name. The routine happened daily: Tess gets mad, stomps away, and Dominic chases her like a dog.</p><p>Carmine didn\u2019t see the appeal. \u201cHe\u2019s pathetic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s what love does to you, you can definitely count me out.\u201d He couldn\u2019t imagine spending every waking moment of every day with the same person, doing the same shit they did the day before. \u201cThat has to be boring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what you do isn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>He looked at her incredulously. \u201cYou think my life is boring? I get what I want, when I want it. I enjoy my freedom too much to give it away for some bitch.\u201d</p><p>Dia cringed. \u201cDo you have to use that word?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat word?\u201d</p><p>She glared at him but didn\u2019t respond. Carmine knew what word she meant, but he didn\u2019t see the big deal, considering it was just that\u2014a word. Whatever happened to \u201csticks and stones can break my bones, but words can never hurt me\u201d?</p><p>The bell rang in the distance, signaling the start of school. \u201cHere comes Moanin\u2019 Lisa,\u201d Dia said, hopping down from her car. \u201cAnd yeah, a girl would be lucky to have you, Carmine, but not like this. You\u2019re wasting your time, and it\u2019s not worth it. You need to find something that is.\u201d</p><p>She scurried away before he had a chance to reply.</p><p>\u201cHey, handsome,\u201d Lisa said as she approached. She leaned against his car, beaming, but he pulled her away from it. He hated people touching his things. She didn\u2019t notice, though, and ran her hand down his chest, fiddling with the buttons on his shirt. \u201cYou look good today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, but you know what would look really good today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBocchino.\u201d He brushed his pointer finger across her pink glossy lips. \u201cThat mouth on me.\u201d</p><p>A sharp pain ricocheted through Carmine\u2019s head as warmth streamed down the side of his face. Every ounce of rationality left his body in a whoosh. He was bleeding. Again.</p><p>Unacceptable.</p><p>A frantic voice rung out, adamantly apologizing, but the words seemed distant as Carmine\u2019s temper dangerously flared. He slammed the locker door that had struck him before pouncing, hurling a boy into another row of lockers, his clenched fist landing straight into his stomach.</p><p>Someone stepped between them, and Carmine nearly swung again until their eyes connected. Coach Woods towered over him, nostrils flaring. \u201cPrincipal\u2019s office!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe? This is bullshit!\u201d</p><p>Coach Woods glared at him. \u201cDon\u2019t speak that way in my locker room! I\u2019ll bench you!\u201d</p><p>As starting quarterback for the varsity football team, Carmine was usually afforded a bit of leniency, but he could tell from his coach\u2019s expression that today was an exception. He grabbed a towel, holding it to his forehead to soak up the trickle of blood as he stormed out.</p><p>The secretary in the front office barely glanced at Carmine when he busted in, throwing himself down in a chair to impatiently wait. She casually radioed the principal, notifying him someone was waiting. Principal Rutledge came out, merely casting Carmine a look that told him to join him. Carmine took his usual seat in the cracked brown leather chair in the small office, still clutching the towel to his head as he sprawled his legs out in front of him.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened this time?\u201d It was a question Principal Rutledge seemed to have asked Carmine every week since his freshman year.</p><p>\u201cSomeone hit me with a locker door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIntentionally?\u201d</p><p>Carmine shrugged. \u201cMight as well have been.\u201d</p><p>The principal picked up his office phone, dialing a number he\u2019d long ago memorized. Carmine glanced around the small space while he waited. He noticed a new picture frame on top of a filing cabinet with a photo of the man\u2019s daughter, a curvy sophomore with brown hair and hazel eyes.</p><p>\u201cYour daughter\u2019s looking good these days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave her alone, Carmine.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled but didn\u2019t have time to respond before the principal focused on the call. \u201cDr. DeMarco, Jack Rutledge here . . . Yes . . . I\u2019m doing well, how about you? Yes, well, there was an incident . . . He is injured . . . No, I don\u2019t think the other boy is . . . He\u2019s still in my office . . . No, he hasn\u2019t been seen by the nurse.\u201d</p><p>Principal Rutledge looked at him. \u201cDo you think you\u2019ll need stitches?\u201d</p><p>Carmine shrugged, but the man didn\u2019t wait for him to respond. \u201cYes, we do have a procedure in place for injured students . . . I understand that . . . With all due respect, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that serious . . . No, you\u2019re right; I\u2019m not a doctor.\u201d He paused, his eyes bulging. \u201cYes, the school\u2019s insured, but I don\u2019t think this is a case of negligence.\u201d</p><p>Carmine slowly smirked. Most people didn\u2019t know what type of man his father truly was, but he managed to terrify the shit out of them anyway.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll send him right over.\u201d The principal hung up, eyeing him cautiously. \u201cYou need to go to the hospital to be checked out. I should\u2019ve sent you right away. I don\u2019t know what I was thinking.\u201d</p><p>Carmine stood. \u201cYeah, I don\u2019t know, either.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Carmine went through the emergency room entrance at the hospital, bypassing the nurse\u2019s station for his father\u2019s office on the third floor. Vincent sat at his desk with his arms crossed over his chest. He motioned for Carmine to come closer and checked his wound. \u201cYou should get a few stitches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice.\u201d</p><p>Vincent removed his glasses and pinched the bridge of his nose. \u201cWhat were you thinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe started it.\u201d</p> <p>His father shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s never your fault, is it? There are only going to be so many \u2018get out of jail free\u2019 cards, Carmine. Someday you\u2019re going to get yourself in a situation that has no way out, and you\u2019re finally going to have to learn to live with the consequences.\u201d</p><p>Carmine scoffed. \u201cRight back at you.\u201d</p><p>Vincent walked him down to a room in the emergency room, and Carmine took a seat on one of the stiff beds as he waited to be sewn up. After a few minutes, the door opened and a young blonde-haired woman in hot pink scrubs stepped in. \u201cMy, my . . . look who it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJen.\u201d Carmine nearly gagged as he said her name. If ever the term gold digger was to make it into the dictionary, Carmine was sure her picture would be plastered beside it. Even he wouldn\u2019t touch her, but his father had. He\u2019d walked in on them one day. The memory of what he\u2019d seen was something he often tried to drink away.</p><p>Three stitches and a stolen double dose of Percocet later, Carmine strolled toward the exit, feeling like he was floating on air. Vincent cornered him in front of the building, still scowling. \u201cGo straight home. We\u2019ll talk when I get there.\u201d</p> <p>Carmine mock-saluted him as he made his way to the parking lot. His car was parked in a spot reserved for a doctor, right in the front near the building. Reaching into his pocket for his keys, his brow furrowed when he felt a piece of paper. \u201cFuck.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d forgotten about the list, after all.</p><p>He climbed into the car, debating for a moment before driving through town. He bypassed the road that led toward home and instead took the highway to Lisa\u2019s.</p><p>Since he was going to be in trouble, he figured he might as well make it worth it.</p><p>Haven hummed while she worked.</p><p>It was a habit she\u2019d had all of her life. Her mama used to say that before Haven could talk, she hummed, mimicking the lullabies she\u2019d sung to her at night in the stables. It had calmed her as a baby, soothed her, and as she went about her work, it had a similar effect.</p> <p>The words to the songs were long forgotten, but the melodies continued to play in her head. It brought Haven back to an earlier time\u2014a time when things were still innocent. She\u2019d hum, and suddenly the sun shined a bit brighter, the world around her not as dark as she knew it could be.</p><p>Used to having every detail of her life controlled, she had a hard time sorting through things on her own. She should\u2019ve gotten clarification, because nothing should be assumed, but she was so afraid of making a mistake that she couldn\u2019t force the questions out. She\u2019d already upset Dr. DeMarco once asking something. How many chances would she get before he snapped?</p><p>So she did whatever came naturally to her. That afternoon, she scrubbed the hardwood floors and cleaned the bathrooms. She dusted and vacuumed, but stayed away from every room with a lock. She found a clear bottle in the supply closet, labeled in black lettering that it was for the windows. They were the only dirty part of the house, so she cleaned them as high up as she could reach.</p><p>By three o\u2019clock, Haven was fresh out of things to do.</p><p>She was sorting through the pantry when the alarm in the foyer beeped and the front door opened. Footsteps headed her direction and her heart thumped wildly. Panicked, she darted for the doorway, irrationally planning to hide, and collided with Dominic when he stepped into the kitchen. \u201cWhoa, Twinkle Toes. Warn me next time you wanna dance.\u201d</p><p>Instinctively, she backed up a few steps. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo biggie,\u201d he said, heading for the refrigerator. \u201cYou hungry?\u201d</p><p>Haven watched the doorway for his company, realizing after a moment he was talking to her. She stammered, her stomach growling before she could get out a coherent thought.</p> <p>He laughed. \u201cI\u2019ll take that as a yes.\u201d</p><p>He slapped some ham and cheese between two slices of bread and grabbed a paper towel, holding it out to her. She stared at the sandwich with surprise but took it carefully. She couldn\u2019t recall the last time she\u2019d eaten anything, too nervous to touch their food on her own.</p><p>Haven took a small bite as Dominic cleaned up, the entire exchange surreal. She couldn\u2019t believe he\u2019d served her, the servant.</p><p>3</p><p>Haven sat on the edge of her bed, her hands folded in her lap and her gaze trained on the floor. She could see Dr. DeMarco\u2019s shoes from the corner of her eye, a small trail of dirt on the carpet behind them that he\u2019d dragged in. The impulsive urge to clean it hit her, but she remained still, not wanting to offend him.</p><p>It was a few minutes past six in the evening. She\u2019d slipped up to her room after eating her sandwich earlier in the day, feeling out of place downstairs.</p><p>\u201cYou cleaned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I told you to relax.\u201d</p><p>She tensed. Was that disrespectful? \u201cI was awake and didn\u2019t know what else to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate the effort,\u201d he said. \u201cIn all honesty, I can\u2019t recall the windows ever being free of grime. You did clean them, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you used the correct cleaner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so,\u201d she said. \u201cThe clear bottle from the closet.\u201d</p><p>He took a step toward her. She flinched when his hand shot out, but her reaction didn\u2019t stop him. Grasping her chin, he forced her to look at him. \u201cI don\u2019t expect perfection, child. Make sure the house is decent, the beds are made, and the laundry is done, and we shouldn\u2019t have any problems. Dinner is to be on the table at seven every night, unless I tell you otherwise. Got it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>Dr. DeMarco let go of her, and she looked away, eye contact uncomfortable. He turned to walk out of the room but stopped in the library when he realized she was right on his heels. \u201cIs there something you need?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s already after six, so I thought I should start dinner.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cTomorrow. Take the night off.\u201d</p><p>She stood there as he walked away, leaving her alone in front of the stairs. Take the night off. The words ran through her mind but refused to sink in, as foreign to her as another language.</p><p>Who are these people?</p><p>1:47 A.M.</p><p>The glowing red numbers on the alarm clock taunted Haven. It was too quiet, the silence deafening. She\u2019d never been on her own for so long before. Even at night in the stables the animals had kept her company while she slept. She usually had her mama, and she realized, as she lay in the dark room, that she\u2019d taken her for granted. She had no one now. She was alone.</p><p>2:12 A.M.</p><p>She thought about her mama, wondering what she was doing and if she was okay. Did she know what happened, or was she imagining her out there somewhere, getting help? Haven pictured her standing on the front porch of the ranch, gazing out at the desert and waiting for a sign. Waiting for rescue. Waiting for her.</p><p>3:28 A.M.</p><p>Haven wondered what would\u2019ve happened had she found someone to save them. Would they be somewhere together? She imagined them having their own house, with a backyard and a fluffy white kitten to keep them company. They\u2019d name her Snowball and she\u2019d climb their tree at Christmas, tearing down the lights and scattering pine needles. They\u2019d have presents and hot chocolate, and there would be snow outside. Haven had only ever seen snow in pictures, but her mama talked about it sometimes. She told her how beautiful it was when it blanketed the ground, how the cold flakes tasted when they landed on your tongue. Haven asked how she knew, since she\u2019d never had a life other than the one they had. \u201cI dream about it,\u201d she\u2019d said. \u201cWhen you dream, you can go anywhere. I always go to the snow.\u201d</p><p>4:18 A.M.</p><p>Haven pictured her mama, skin flushed from the cold. Flakes stuck to her hair, and she glowed, smiling as she twirled in the snow. She was happier than Haven had ever seen her before, living a normal life . . . the kind of life she always should have had.</p><p>5:03 A.M.</p><p>Her cheeks were stained from tears and her eyes burned like grains of sand were caught in them. She felt like she was running again, the air suffocating as she struggled to breathe, but no matter how hard she fought, she\u2019d get nowhere.</p><p>5:46 A.M.</p><p>The faint sound of music filtered into the room, a welcome disruption from the agonizing silence. The soft melody comforted Haven. She relaxed as the tension left her body, but it did nothing to shut off her mind. She lay awake, listening as she stared at the clock, wishing for relief.</p><p>6:30 A.M.</p><p>The time they\u2019d gotten up at the ranch. Haven climbed out of bed after the music stopped and wiped the tears from her face. She quietly slipped into the library and wandered along the tall stacks, running her fingertips along the spines of the books. She kept the light off, but the window let in enough of a glow for her to see. A strange sense of peace settled over her. For the first time in a long time\u2014possibly ever\u2014Haven almost felt safe.</p><p>Almost.</p><p>She walked to the window and gazed out, the sky lightening as the sun rose. The backyard was lush and green, trees scattered throughout the clearing with the edge of the forest a few hundred yards away. Haven wondered how far the trees went and which direction the closest town was, how long it would take someone to get there on foot.</p><p>Eventually, a quiet cough warned her she was no longer alone. Carmine strolled toward the stairs with a white bandage on his head that hadn\u2019t been there yesterday. The sight of him made something inside of Haven twist.</p><p>His gaze shifted to her, and he jumped, grabbing his chest. \u201cChrist, what are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust looking,\u201d she said, motioning toward the window.</p><p>\u201cIn the dark? You couldn\u2019t turn on a light?\u201d</p><p>She tore her eyes from his. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d he said. \u201cJust try to make some noise next time. You\u2019re worse than a damn cat sneaking around. Maybe you need a bell.\u201d</p><p>Traitorous tears formed. Don\u2019t let him see you cry, she silently chanted. \u201cI\u2019ll try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are you, anyway? What are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaven,\u201d she said quietly, peeking at him.</p><p>He gazed at her peculiarly. His eyes were bloodshot, dark bags under them. \u201cHeaven? No, this definitely isn\u2019t Heaven. But I get why you\u2019re confused, since I\u2019m standing in front of you.\u201d She stared at him, and he cracked a smile. \u201cI\u2019m kidding. Well, kinda . . . I have been told I\u2019ve taken a girl to Heaven a time or two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaven, not Heaven,\u201d she said, louder than before. Nothing about the conversation made sense to her. \u201cMy name\u2019s Haven. It means\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what it means.\u201d His sharp voice cut her off. She recoiled from the tone and pressed her back against the cold glass of the window. His moods changed too quickly for her to get a read on his frame of mind. \u201cSo, what happened to you? I mean, no offense, but you\u2019re kinda fucked up. Looks like you\u2019ve been to Hell and back.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She reached up to touch her bruised face when it dawned on her what he meant. \u201cI fell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou fell? If you don\u2019t wanna tell me, say so. No need for a bullshit response.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonestly, I fell! I tried to, uh . . . I was . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to explain. It\u2019s none of my business, anyway.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut I did fall,\u201d she insisted. He still didn\u2019t look convinced, but she wasn\u2019t sure what else she could say. She pointed to his bandage. \u201cWhat happened to you?\u201d</p><p>He touched his injury like she\u2019d done and shrugged. \u201cI fell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, laughing as he disappeared down the stairs.</p><p>She frowned. \u201cBut I did.\u201d</p> <p>When Carmine was ten years old, his father brought home a cat, its fur scraggly and tail chopped off. It infested the house with fleas and clawed up the furniture. Two weeks later the cat disappeared. Carmine never asked what happened to it. Frankly, he didn\u2019t care.</p><p>When he was fourteen, it was two dogs. The first was a little ankle biter with kinky yellow fur and three legs. It pissed all over the house before chewing up Vincent\u2019s favorite shoes. It didn\u2019t last a week. The second dog was a pit bull with one eye and deformed ears. His father tied it up in the backyard, and it barked all night, keeping them awake. Carmine could barely function in school the next day, and when he got home, the dog was gone.</p><p>So Carmine wished he was shocked when his father brought home a girl, but he wasn\u2019t. He figured he was just picking up strays again. But Carmine could tell something was different, and he didn\u2019t know what to make of it. His father was buying the girl things. He hadn\u2019t even bought the last dog any food.</p><p>That fact weighed heavily on him as he strolled down the stairs. He told himself it was sheer curiosity fueling his thoughts, but the truth was, in just one day, the strange girl had gotten under his skin. He couldn\u2019t pinpoint why or what to do about it, but he didn\u2019t like the nagging feeling in the pit of his stomach. It irritated him, keeping him awake all night long, like a tiny little hammer chipping away at his insides. Fucking conscience.</p><p>He paused on the second floor in front of his father\u2019s office. \u201cHey, do you want me to\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>Vincent\u2019s sharp voice made Carmine stop midsentence. \u201cYou didn\u2019t let me finish. I was gonna ask\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need you to finish,\u201d Vincent said, remaining hunched over his laptop with his reading glasses low on his nose. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to do anything for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what about the\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d Vincent laughed humorlessly. \u201cNot like you\u2019d actually worry about it. You don\u2019t care about anything that doesn\u2019t benefit you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true. I care about\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist, can I get out a full sentence? I\u2019m trying to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need your help,\u201d Vincent said, shaking his head. \u201cI asked you to do one thing, and you couldn\u2019t do it. Lesson learned, son. I now know I can\u2019t count on you.\u201d</p> <p>Ouch. The list.</p><p>\u201cI forgot,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll make it up to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too late. I already asked someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJen.\u201d</p><p>He grimaced. \u201cWhy her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, she knows the sorts of things girls need, since she is one.\u201d</p><p>With some effort, Carmine refrained from making a crack about Jen\u2019s age, but he couldn\u2019t hold back his opinion entirely. \u201cIf by that you mean they need birth control and a heavy dose of penicillin, I agree.\u201d</p><p>Vincent shot him a disapproving look. \u201cYou can\u2019t judge, given the company you keep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue, but I\u2019m not exactly role model material, am I? Would you want me doing the shopping?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019d come home with underwear no bigger than dental floss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you think Jen won\u2019t? She doesn\u2019t even wear underwear.\u201d</p><p>Vincent glared at him. \u201cAren\u2019t you late for school?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d</p><p>He turned to walk away, but his father called after him. \u201cIf you really want to make it up to me, there\u2019s something you can do.\u201d</p><p>Carmine glanced back at him. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay out of trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try, but I\u2019m pretty sure wreaking havoc is in my genes, Dad.\u201d</p><p>An hour and a half later, Carmine waltzed into his second period classroom and disrupted the American history teacher, Mrs. Anderson, in the middle of a lecture. She smiled curtly. \u201cMr. DeMarco, you\u2019re just in time to give your presentation on the Battle of Gettysburg.\u201d</p><p>He groaned, having forgotten all about them having oral presentations today. She motioned toward the front of the room, and he begrudgingly took his place as she sat behind her desk. \u201cYou can begin any time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, the battle happened in Pennsylvania. It was, like, 1800s.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Anderson corrected him, \u201c1863.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, what she said. General Lee led his army up from the South; they met the North in Gettysburg. A bunch of people died on both sides, hundreds of thousands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTens of thousands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame difference,\u201d he said. \u201cThe South lost and the North won. Abraham Lincoln came and gave the Emancipation Proclamation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Gettysburg Address,\u201d Mrs. Anderson said. \u201cThe Emancipation Proclamation was delivered six months before the battle.\u201d</p><p>He gave an exaggerated sigh. \u201cWho\u2019s giving the report here?\u201d</p><p>She waved her hand. \u201cProceed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I said, the North won. The slaves were all freed. Hurrah, hurrah. The end.\u201d</p><p>He bowed jokingly, and everyone laughed as Mrs. Anderson shook her head. \u201cDid you even read the material?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho was the leader of the North?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLincoln.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he was the president.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, which means he was the fucking leader of everyone.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Anderson\u2019s face clouded with anger. Oops. \u201cYou won\u2019t use that language in my classroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould\u2019ve fooled me,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought I already did.\u201d</p><p>A collective gasp resonated among his classmates as Mrs. Anderson stood, and Carmine started toward the door before the words could come from her mouth. \u201cPrincipal\u2019s office,\u201d he muttered, mocking her at the same time she said it.</p><p>In no rush to see the principal again, Carmine headed out of a side exit, going for his car in the student parking lot instead.</p><p>The house was silent when Carmine made it home. He headed to the third floor and paused at the top of the stairs. In the library, in the same spot she\u2019d been hours earlier, stood Haven. She stared out into the backyard with a vacant expression, her arms wrapped around her chest.</p><p>He cleared his throat to get her attention, and she flinched but didn\u2019t look his way. After a moment, he strolled over and stood beside her. Her body grew rigid as she held her breath, tension rolling off of her when their arms brushed together. The simple contact wouldn\u2019t have registered with him if not for her reaction. \u201cHave you even moved today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He waited for her to elaborate, but no more words came. It wasn\u2019t until then that he realized she had on his shirt and pants, vaguely recalling his father taking them from his room. \u201cYou\u2019re wearing my clothes.\u201d</p><p>Carmine didn\u2019t think it was possible, but she managed to grow tenser. \u201cI can take them off.\u201d</p><p>He stifled a laugh. \u201cYou\u2019re offering to take off your clothes for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour clothes. I have none of my own.\u201d</p><p>And just like that, she made him feel a twinge of guilt. She\u2019d have had clothes if he had done what his father asked. \u201cWhat happened to whatever you came here in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were bloody, so Dr. DeMarco got rid of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhose blood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMine.\u201d</p><p>He tilted his head and stared at her. There was something strange about the way she stood motionless but still managed to seem like she was fidgeting. It made him uneasy.</p><p>\u201cKeep the clothes,\u201d he said, wanting away from her to clear his head. He didn\u2019t like feeling uncomfortable in his house. \u201cI\u2019m gonna take a nap, Heaven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaven,\u201d she corrected him.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said. \u201cI kinda like Heaven, though.\u201d</p><p>She turned to him, their eyes meeting for the first time since he\u2019d walked in. \u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>Despite Carmine\u2019s fierce protectiveness over his belongings, he wasn\u2019t careful about what he did with things. His bedroom was cluttered, everything haphazardly strewn around the floor. Shoes were scattered among heaps of dirty clothes, his hamper sitting empty in the corner of the room. His desk was covered with papers and books, a laptop buried somewhere in the mess.</p><p>It never bothered him. He was used to it, nothing about his life neat or tidy. He felt safe tucked into the chaos, surrounded by the things only he controlled. It was that he craved\u2014control over his life\u2014because it was the one thing Carmine never had.</p><p>A loud succession of bangs pulled Carmine from his nap, and he staggered to the door to find his father there. Vincent barged into the room, stumbling over some stuff lying on the floor. Grumbling, he kicked it out of the way. \u201cWhere are your keys?\u201d</p><p>Carmine rubbed his eyes, his guard going up with someone in his personal space. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour car keys,\u201d Vincent said as he started searching through the desk, furiously pushing things around and tossing half of it on the floor.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell do you want my keys for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust give them to me!\u201d Vincent opened the top right drawer and grabbed Carmine\u2019s wallet. Fumbling through it, he pulled out the silver American Express credit card and shoved it into his pocket before tossing the wallet aside, going right back to searching.</p><p>Carmine\u2019s blood boiled. \u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried to be your friend,\u201d Vincent said. \u201cI cut you some slack, hoping it was a phase, but you only got worse. So I sent you away. After what you did last year, so help me God, I hoped you\u2019d get the message. But no, you come back and start the cycle all over again. The fighting, the back talking, the disrespect . . . I can\u2019t take it anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell did I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe better question would be what didn\u2019t you do.\u201d He slammed a drawer and grabbed the bottom one, but it wouldn\u2019t budge. \u201cWhat\u2019s in here?\u201d</p><p>Carmine didn\u2019t answer, watching as his father yanked on it.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the key to open it, Carmine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not getting it. You\u2019re not getting any of my keys.\u201d</p><p>Vincent stood up straight at his words. \u201cI am getting your keys. You\u2019re on restriction. You\u2019ll go nowhere but to school, and you\u2019ll stay there. No more cutting class. You\u2019ll do your work, you\u2019ll watch your mouth, you\u2019ll keep your hands to yourself, and when that last bell rings, you\u2019ll come straight home. Nothing else!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cI have football.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t tell me what you can\u2019t do. I tell you!\u201d</p><p>Carmine clenched his hands into fists. \u201cSo you\u2019re gonna take football from me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou brought this upon yourself.\u201d</p> <p>Carmine narrowed his eyes as his father moved from the desk to the dresser. \u201cI\u2019m just living the life you gave me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t blame me for this,\u201d Vincent said, opening the top dresser drawer. Carmine groaned as he pulled out his set of keys. \u201cYour brother turned out fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy brother didn\u2019t go through what I went through! But you know what? I don\u2019t care. Go ahead and take football. You might as well. I\u2019ve lost everything else because of you!\u201d</p><p>There was a moment, when those contemptuous words hung in the air between them, that it seemed like time stopped. It was a low blow, and Carmine almost felt guilty when he saw the hurt in his father\u2019s eyes. \u201cYou\u2019ll always blame me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re damn right I will,\u201d Carmine said. \u201cGive me my keys back.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Every ounce of sensibility Carmine had slipped away when his father turned his back to him. \u201cIf you don\u2019t give me my keys, I\u2019ll call the police.\u201d</p><p>Vincent turned back around so fast the movement startled Carmine. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d risk everything over a car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cYou would, too, if it was all you had left.\u201d</p> <p>That flicker of hurt returned but faded as fast as before. Vincent threw the keys at Carmine, hitting him in the chest with them. \u201cKeep the car, and go play your precious football, but the credit card\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care. I don\u2019t need your money.\u201d</p><p>Vincent laughed dryly. \u201cWe\u2019ll see about that.\u201d</p><p>A dozen overflowing shopping bags littered the bedroom floor, splashes of brilliant color against the dreary carpet. Dr. DeMarco had brought them in, saying they were necessities, but Haven had gone her whole life without so much stuff. \u201cAll of this is for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Dr. DeMarco stood in the doorway behind her, rocking on his heels. He was irate, though she wasn\u2019t sure why. \u201cIf you find there\u2019s something missing, let me know.\u201d</p><p>Haven mumbled her thanks as he left, leaving her alone with her new belongings. She unpacked carefully, hanging the clothes in the closet and putting the bathroom items away. Used to having a bar of white soap, she had no idea what things like bath salts and pumice stones were for. She found a brush, though, and ran it through her hair, cringing as she snagged on the massive knots.</p><p>She changed into some fresh clothes, taking off what belonged to Carmine, before heading downstairs to start dinner. Cooking hadn\u2019t been her main job in Blackburn, as her mama usually worked in the kitchen, but Haven had helped her whenever she got the chance.</p><p>Cooking, according to her mama, was an art. Recipes and instructions were unnecessary, because the best meals were made with intuition and heart. Her mama always put her all into her food, even if she hadn\u2019t been allowed to taste it. It was a trait Haven had picked up, one that was coming in handy as she stood in the DeMarco\u2019s kitchen.</p> <p>Dr. DeMarco walked in as she finished a pot of spaghetti, and she stood back, nervously awaiting his reaction. He scanned the meal before nodding. \u201cWill you be eating with us?\u201d</p><p>Instinctively, she shook her head.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to, but I do insist you eat something every day. I won\u2019t allow you to starve under my roof.\u201d</p><p>Even something as generous as offering food sounded like an order coming from him.</p><p>4</p><p>Living in Blackburn hadn\u2019t been easy for Haven, with an overabundance of work and a lack of food, but she always found a way to get by. It was a dismal life, but it had been hers, and it was the only one she\u2019d ever known.</p><p>Durante, on the other hand, with its slow pace and down time, intimidated her.</p><p>By the third day, she fell into a routine. She cleaned during the day and cooked at night before hiding away until everyone went to bed. She\u2019d slip downstairs then and eat something in the dark dining room, before retreating to the bedroom. She\u2019d climb into bed, the music always starting not long after. She wasn\u2019t sure where it came from but the sound of it would ease her to sleep, and she\u2019d stay there until everyone left the house for the day.</p><p>While easier, little things knocked her off-kilter. The strong mint of real toothpaste, hot bathing water, and eating with silverware were small amenities, but each made her stumble a bit. She had been deprived of things everyone else took for granted. Even wearing shoes made her feet hurt. She didn\u2019t like them a bit.</p><p>It was a few minutes past three on her third day when Haven encountered Dominic again. He came into the house and dropped a backpack on the floor before taking a seat in the family room. She considered fleeing upstairs, but that made her feel guilty. He\u2019d been overwhelmingly kind to her.</p><p>She stepped into the family room, nervously picking at her brittle fingernails. \u201cCan I do something for you?\u201d</p><p>Dominic shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m cool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure? There has to be something I can do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh . . . I could always eat something, I guess.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cEat what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurprise me.\u201d</p><p>Haven headed for the kitchen and made a peanut butter and grape jelly sandwich before grabbing a paper towel. She walked back into the family room, and Dominic took it. \u201cYou seriously didn\u2019t have to do this.\u201d</p><p>She averted her gaze. \u201cBut you made me one . . .\u201d</p><p>She went to the kitchen before he could respond and wiped down the counters. A little while later, as she defrosted chicken for dinner, she spotted Dominic lugging his hamper downstairs. She stepped into the foyer, directly in his path. \u201cCan I get that for you?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re offering to do my laundry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Dominic hesitated but let go of the hamper so Haven could pull it to the laundry room. He followed, pausing in the doorway. \u201cLook, Twinkle Toes, I don\u2019t know who you are . . .\u201d</p><p>She chimed in. \u201cI\u2019m Haven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaven. The point is I make it a habit to stay out of my father\u2019s dealings. It gives me plausible deniability, which means I have no idea what\u2019s going on with this\u201d\u2014he waved his hands all around them\u2014\u201csituation. The way I see it, since you\u2019re staying here, it\u2019s only right for me to be hospitable. So if I get you a sandwich, don\u2019t feel like you have to make it up to me. It\u2019s just a sandwich.\u201d</p><p>She said nothing, but he was wrong. It wasn\u2019t just a sandwich. It was more than that to her.</p><p>\u201cAnd I appreciate the offer to help with my laundry. Thanks, Haven.\u201d</p><p>He walked away as she whispered, \u201cNo, thank you.\u201d</p><p>Dinner was ready again at a quarter to seven, and Haven kept it warm as she folded Dominic\u2019s clothes. The front door opened while she was in the laundry room, and she stepped out to greet Dr. DeMarco.</p><p>Was she supposed to? She wasn\u2019t sure.</p><p>\u201cSmells terrific in here,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThank you, sir. The food\u2019s ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. Carmine should be home from football practice in a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>Her pulse quickened at the mention of Carmine. She hadn\u2019t seen him since their awkward encounter in the library, and she wasn\u2019t sure she wanted to see him so soon again.</p><p>She set the table, placing the food in the center for them to serve themselves, before grabbing Dominic\u2019s hamper and heading upstairs. She made it to the second floor when the front door swung open, Carmine\u2019s voice hitting her instantly. \u201cCazzo, what smells so good?\u201d</p><p>She smiled to herself and resumed walking, placing Dominic\u2019s clothes outside his bedroom door before shutting herself away to hide.</p><p>The next evening, Dr. DeMarco arrived home as Haven was looking for something to make for dinner. \u201cI forgot to tell you. You have the night off.\u201d</p><p>She closed the pantry door. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Friday, so the boys will be at the football game, and I\u2019ll be gone this weekend on business.\u201d</p><p>Confusion set in. He was leaving? \u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want me to make you something before you go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPositive.\u201d He reached out, and she flinched, but it didn\u2019t discourage him from grasping her shoulder. \u201cCome with me. I want to show you something.\u201d</p><p>She followed him into the family room, where he picked up a cordless telephone. \u201cI had a phone installed in case you need anything when I\u2019m away. Speed dial number one goes directly to my cell phone. If I don\u2019t answer and it\u2019s an emergency, speed dial number two is Dominic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Carmine number three?\u201d The words flew from her mouth before she had enough sense to restrain them.</p><p>\u201cYes, but any trouble you encounter won\u2019t be as bad as the trouble that follows my youngest. So if you need anything, call the first two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She stared at the phone. \u201cHow do I do that?\u201d</p><p>Sighing, Dr. DeMarco gave some quick instructions on how to place a call. A flurry of thoughts hit her as she listened, but Dr. DeMarco cut them off. \u201cI\u2019ll know any time it\u2019s used, so don\u2019t get any bright ideas like calling 911.\u201d</p><p>Her brow furrowed. \u201cWho\u2019s 911?\u201d</p><p>He stared at her as if he thought she might be joking. \u201cLet\u2019s just say calling 911 is the last thing you want to do, child.\u201d</p><p>Dr. DeMarco left, and those words ran through Haven\u2019s mind as she wandered the empty house. She ended up in the family room after a while, standing in front of the white telephone again.</p><p>Picking it up, she turned it on like Dr. DeMarco had shown her. She hit the 9 button before pressing the number 1, her finger hovering over the 1 again. She stood there, her heart pounding rapidly, before pressing the button to turn off the phone.</p><p>She did it three more times before placing the phone into its cradle and leaving the room, too frightened to press the last number.</p><p>The sun was setting when Haven ended up in the library. She came across some paper and swiped a few pieces, finding a pencil before eagerly running to her room. She lay down in bed and sketched, her mama\u2019s face emerging on the paper. With no pictures, Haven was desperately afraid she would forget what her mama looked like, afraid her memory would fade with time.</p><p>Drawing came naturally to Haven. When she was little, around the age of seven, her first mistress, Monica, gave her paper and crayons. It was the first time she\u2019d given her anything, and it turned out to be the last, but Haven cherished the gift until the last shred of crayon disappeared.</p><p>As she grew older, she\u2019d sneak supplies from the ranch house, but afterward destroyed all evidence so no one would find out. She usually folded the sketches and stuck them in her pocket, burying the papers the first chance she got.</p><p>Haven lost track of time as she immersed herself in the drawing of her mama, and it was nearing midnight when the sound of music captured her attention. It was earlier than the other nights. Curious, she set the drawing aside and crept to the door to peek out. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Carmine sat in the library, holding a tan acoustic guitar. Darkness obstructed Haven\u2019s view of his face, but the glow from the moonlight illuminated his hands as he plucked the strings.</p><p>She took a few steps forward, entranced as the music smoothed out and grew louder. It swirled all around her, goose bumps springing up as the melody seeped into her skin. Her stomach fluttered and limbs tingled, warmth spreading throughout her body. She closed her eyes, reveling in the foreign sensation, until the music stopped.</p><p>Haven\u2019s eyes snapped back open, and she could see his face then, still partially encased in the shadows. He frowned, staring at her with questions in his eyes, but she had no answers to give.</p><p>Turning on her heel, Haven ran back into the room and closed the door, pressing her back against it as the music started up once more.</p> <p>The next morning, Carmine woke up earlier than usual and grabbed a bowl of cereal, his footsteps faltering in the family room. Dominic sat on the couch reading a Sports Illustrated, and Haven was beside him, neither of them speaking.</p><p>Before Carmine could utter a single word, Haven leaped to her feet and scurried away. He watched her retreating form before taking the seat she\u2019d vacated. \u201cShe acts like I\u2019m diseased and she\u2019s gonna catch something by coming near me.\u201d</p><p>Dominic nodded. \u201cI noticed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t done anything.\u201d He paused. \u201cI don\u2019t think, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t realize how abrasive you come off,\u201d Dominic said. \u201cIt\u2019s the way you look at people.\u201d</p> <p>Carmine shrugged. There wasn\u2019t anything he could do about that. \u201cWhatever. There\u2019s obviously something wrong with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you taken the time to ask her what it might be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t had a chance,\u201d he said. \u201cLike I said, she runs from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, maybe if you took an interest in her, she wouldn\u2019t act sketchy around you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what you did\u2014took an interest?\u201d Carmine asked. \u201cI\u2019m not sure Tess would be happy about that.\u201d</p><p>Dominic shoved him, spilling some of his cereal. \u201cI was nice to her, bro. You should try it.\u201d</p> <p>Carmine brushed some of the stray Lucky Charms from his lap, glaring at the wet patch where the milk had soaked into his pants. \u201cAsshole.\u201d</p><p>Vincent DeMarco was an easily recognized man. The people in Durante knew him as the talented doctor and the dedicated single father, the wealthy bachelor women rigorously pursued. He\u2019d accumulated a few wayward gray hairs, but he looked younger than his forty years. He was like his father that way. Antonio DeMarco had died at fifty when he looked more like a youthful thirty-five.</p><p>Genetics, Vincent thought, was a peculiar thing.</p><p>Although he was well known, few people saw the man behind the mask. Vincent felt like he lived two different lives, both equally real yet at odds with each other. He liked to believe he was the family man that others saw, but he was also deeply committed to a different type of family.</p><p>A family not bonded by genetics, instead forged by spilled blood and sworn oaths. LCN, the government called it, short for La Cosa Nostra, but it was known by many different names: la famiglia, borgata, outfit, syndicate. It all meant the same. The Mafia.</p><p>He\u2019d taken a step back from the life years ago, moving away from Chicago and the center of the action, but there was no leaving the organization once it had you in its brutal grasp. He was kept on as an unofficial consigliere to the Don, Salvatore Capozzi. Vincent\u2019s job was to play the middleman, to give advice when asked and come when called, and he did this obediently, taking care of whatever needed to be handled. But just because he was good at what he did, didn\u2019t mean he enjoyed it.</p><p>Vincent sat in the smoky den of the mansion in Lincoln Park, holding a full glass of scotch as he listened to the swarm of men debate business. There were twenty of them, but Vincent wasn\u2019t sure why half were there. They had no say in how things were run, some of them so new they hadn\u2019t earned their buttons. There was no reason to trust them\u2014no reason to confide in them\u2014considering there was no blood on their hands.</p><p>Not to say he wanted them to be murderers. He envied their clear consciences and wished he could warn them all to turn away. Get out while they still could, because someday it would be too late . . . and that someday would probably end with a lengthy prison sentence.</p> <p>Or a hollow-point bullet to the brain. Vincent hadn\u2019t decided which outcome would be worse.</p><p>But he couldn\u2019t warn anyone. He\u2019d sworn an oath to put the organization first, and if the organization wanted these dime-a-dozen thugs, Vincent would deal with his ill feelings silently. He\u2019d initiated young\u2014one of the youngest made men in history. Usually guys struggled for decades trying to prove themselves worthy, most never surviving long enough to see it happen. But not Vincent. He\u2019d slipped right in the door while his father was in control.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t the youngest to do business with them, though. Kids were recruited fresh from high school, molded into vindictive soldiers to do the family\u2019s bidding. The young ones incurred all the risk, while those at the top lavished in the fruits of their labor.</p><p>Blood money. Hundreds had died to pay for the mansion in which they sat.</p><p>\u201cWe cannot tolerate these things. They are savages.\u201d</p><p>Giovanni was speaking, his thick accent making Vincent strain to pay attention. Sicilian by birth, he\u2019d immigrated to America a decade before and moved up in rank to become their highest-producing Capo. Some of his crew was present, sitting off to the side. Vincent had a hard time remembering the names of the soldati, but one he was familiar with was Nunzio.</p><p>Nunzio had been lurking around for years. They called him Squint because of the way his eyes always seemed to be half-closed, his face frozen in a roguish scowl. He kept his head buzzed, a light dusting of brown hair showing, and his eyes were the dull color of cracked earth. The Don\u2019s brother had taken him in as a baby, so Salvatore had a soft spot for the boy.</p><p>The men argued back and forth as Vincent swirled the scotch around in his glass, having no intention of drinking it. He remained quiet until the unmistakable voice of the Don chimed in, speaking directly to him. \u201cWhat do you think, Vincent?\u201d</p><p>I think I want to go home. \u201cI think being hasty will backfire. I don\u2019t like the way the Russians conduct business, but they\u2019ve yet to hurt any of our people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey will,\u201d Giovanni warned.</p><p>\u201cIf they do, it\u2019ll be handled,\u201d Vincent said, \u201cbut until that time comes, who are we to police another group?\u201d</p><p>Vincent looked across the room at where the Don sat in his favorite chair. In his late sixties, Sal was shaped like a balloon and sounded perpetually full of helium. He\u2019d been the underboss when Vincent\u2019s father ran things and succeeded rule after he died. Antonio had dubbed him Salamander. \u201cIf you scare a salamander, he\u2019ll drop his tail and run,\u201d he had said. \u201cNo skin off his back. Two weeks later, he\u2019s good as new.\u201d</p><p>Sal mulled over Vincent\u2019s words. \u201cYou\u2019re right. Maybe they\u2019ll take themselves out with their stupidity.\u201d</p><p>Squint laughed dryly, but tried to cover it with a forced cough when everyone looked his way. The guy beside him seemed annoyed by the outburst, another soldato whose name eluded Vincent. He thought it might be Johnny, one of about a hundred other Johnnys running around the streets. His looks certainly fit the name\u2014generic, undistinguishable. Another number in the crowd, easily replaced, never missed. A tail, Vincent thought. Sal would drop him and keep going.</p><p>When Sal dismissed them with a wave of the hand, Vincent was the first out of his seat. He dumped the scotch and headed for the door, but Giovanni cut him off. \u201cI think we are making a mistake, Doc. It will do us no good ignoring them now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not ignoring them,\u201d Vincent said. \u201cWe\u2019re just not going to instigate a fight. The last thing we need is violence on our streets over things that have nothing to do with us.\u201d</p><p>Vincent headed for his rental car when Giovanni\u2019s voice rang out once more. \u201cJust because we do not know of anything does not mean they have not violated us. There will be war.\u201d</p><p>5</p><p>Carmine pulled the last clean shirt off the hanger in his closet. The small piles of laundry had morphed into mountains, every piece of clothing he owned now dirty on the floor. Usually it wouldn\u2019t have gotten that far, as he would have taken them to the local laundry service, but he had a problem\u2014he was broke.</p><p>He strolled through the library to the other side of the floor and grabbed Dominic\u2019s doorknob, his brow furrowing when it wouldn\u2019t turn. He could hear voices inside and pounded on the door.</p><p>Dominic opened it. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Carmine noticed Tess lying across the bed in one of Dominic\u2019s shirts, and cringed at the mental image of what he\u2019d interrupted. \u201cI need some money. My clothes are dirty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, a loan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a funny way of asking, bro,\u201d Dominic said. \u201cAnd how are you going to pay me back when you don\u2019t have a job?\u201d</p><p>Carmine shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ll figure it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you will,\u201d Dominic said. \u201cYou\u2019ll figure out how to do your own damn laundry.\u201d</p><p>The door slammed in Carmine\u2019s face. Tess laughed inside the room as Carmine punched the wall before heading back to his bedroom. He grabbed his cell phone and dialed Dia\u2019s home number, breathing a sigh of relief when she answered. \u201cWhat do you want, Carmine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think I want something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I know you,\u201d she said. \u201cYou don\u2019t call to chitchat.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cMy laundry needs done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me to do your laundry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I don\u2019t know who else to ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, how much money do you have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone.\u201d</p><p>All he heard was the sound of laughter before Dia hung up.</p><p>Irritated, he picked up armfuls of clothes and tossed them in the hamper before dragging it downstairs. As soon as he reached the laundry room, he heard the humming, soft and sweet like a lullaby. Haven stood in front of the dryer, folding clothes. She glanced at him apprehensively as she quieted, her eyes darting from him to his overfull hamper. He lugged it into the room and opened the washing machine hatch, shoving all the clothes into it. It overflowed, and he had to push on them to get the door closed. He looked around for some detergent and caught Haven\u2019s eyes again as she gaped at him, holding a pair of pants.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure what her problem was, but he was too aggravated to deal with it. Another week had passed with her avoiding him, dodging from rooms before he could say hello.</p><p>\u201cSo, where\u2019s the soap?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou know, the Tide or whatever we use around here?\u201d</p><p>Haven reached behind her and opened a small cabinet, pulling out a jug of laundry detergent. Carmine opened the washer again as he took it from her, and he was about to pour it straight in when Haven sharply inhaled.</p><p>The intake of breath stalled him. \u201cWhat?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t you put in the water first?\u201d</p><p>He wavered. \u201cShould I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was taught to start it, put the soap in, and add laundry to the line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat line?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe line that tells you how far to fill the machine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a limit?\u201d He set the jug of detergent down before pulling his clothes back out. Haven returned to folding as he glared at the front of the washer. \u201cWhere\u2019s the start button?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t a button,\u201d she said. \u201cYou choose your setting and pull the dial.\u201d</p><p>Her nonchalance at doing laundry annoyed him. \u201cWhat exactly is my setting? It looks to me like the setting is the goddamn laundry room and the plot is I don\u2019t know how to fucking turn this thing on.\u201d</p><p>Her brow furrowed. \u201cShould I . . . do it for you?\u201d</p> <p>The question caught him off guard. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>She reached over and turned the dial to colors. It filled with water, and she measured some detergent before putting in half his clothes. She worked briskly, pushing the hamper with the rest of the laundry off to the side before turning back to folding hers.</p><p>Carmine stood there, anxious, unsure of what to say. All week long he had invented conversations in his mind, shit he\u2019d say to her when she stopped eluding him, and now that she was in front of him, he drew a blank. \u201cSo, you\u2019re good at that shit.\u201d</p><p>Awkward.</p><p>She smiled softly. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing it my whole life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, this is a first for me,\u201d he muttered. \u201cSo, who are you?\u201d</p> <p>She looked confused. \u201cI told you my name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but that doesn\u2019t tell me who you are. Do you have a last name?\u201d</p><p>She continued to fold her laundry. \u201cAntonelli, maybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really have one, but that\u2019s his.\u201d</p><p>He cocked his head to the side, studying her. \u201cWhose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy master\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean your master?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou know, my master where I came from.\u201d</p><p>No, he didn\u2019t know. \u201cWhere did you come from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlackburn. California, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think? Did you live there long?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cUntil I came here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re not sure where it is?\u201d He was stunned. \u201cDid you hate the place or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDepends on what you mean by that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExplain it to me.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cI didn\u2019t like my master, but I had someone there who understood me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere I have food to eat and clothes to wear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut no one understands you?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cMy masters treat me nicely, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa.\u201d Masters? That rubbed him the wrong way. \u201cWhy the hell do you keep saying that? It sounds wrong, like you\u2019re a servant or a slave or something.\u201d</p><p>She peeked at him as he spoke. \u201cAren\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow . . . ? What the fuck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t bad here,\u201d she quickly explained. \u201cPeople like me wish for the kind of place where they don\u2019t have to fear paying for someone else\u2019s mistakes with their life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd wherever you came from, you worried you\u2019d be killed for no reason?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, there\u2019s always a reason,\u201d she said. \u201cJust not one you caused.\u201d</p><p>Carmine was taken aback by how much he understood the strange girl. She may not have seen it, but Carmine knew what it was like to pay for others\u2019 mistakes. He knew what it was like to live knowing your life could end because of something that had absolutely nothing to do with you.</p><p>But masters? That he didn\u2019t get.</p><p>She finished folding her clothes in silence before making a move to leave, but Carmine remained in the doorway, blocking her only exit.</p><p>\u201cDo you need anything else?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI need to know why you hate me.\u201d</p><p>Her brow furrowed. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou run from me; you won\u2019t look at me or talk to me. The only reason you\u2019re doing it now is because you don\u2019t think you have a choice. You have no problem being around my brother, so why the problem with me? Am I that horrible?\u201d She stared at him as he rambled in frustration, her muteness putting him more on edge. \u201cChrist, now I\u2019m fucking yelling at you, like that\u2019s going to fix anything. Is that what\u2019s wrong? Is it my temper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t hate you. I just . . . don\u2019t understand you.\u201d</p><p>Something about those words was like a dagger striking his chest. No one had understood him before, but he wanted her to. He needed her to, because for the first time in years, he wondered if someone finally could.</p><p>The ringing of his phone thwarted his response. He pulled it out of his pocket, and she took the opportunity to slip past him.</p><p>\u201cHaven,\u201d he called, stepping out of the laundry room behind her. \u201cI think you\u2019ll find we\u2019re a lot alike if you take the chance to get to know me.\u201d</p><p>He turned away from her to answer the call. \u201cYeah, Dia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have hung up,\u201d Dia said. \u201cDo you still need your laundry done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I got it,\u201d he said. \u201cSomeone showed me how to do it.\u201d</p><p>He realized, as he glanced into the laundry room, that he hadn\u2019t even thanked Haven for her help.</p><p>Carmine burst into his father\u2019s office and plopped down in the chair in front of the desk. Vincent put down the medical journal he\u2019d been flipping through and removed his glasses. \u201cCome in, son. You\u2019re not interrupting at all.\u201d</p><p>Not in the mood for a lecture, Carmine dived in to what was on his mind. \u201cWhy\u2019s that girl here?\u201d</p><p>Vincent sighed. \u201cHaven\u2019t we already had this conversation? You said you didn\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI care now.\u201d His own words caught him off guard. Did he?</p><p>Vincent eyed him suspiciously. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Good fucking question. \u201cShe says some weird shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t aware you cared to talk to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, she\u2019s staying in my house . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy house,\u201d Vincent corrected him. \u201cYour grandfather left this place to me when he died. And the girl\u2019s here because I brought her here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWillingly? Because it doesn\u2019t seem like she\u2019s on vacation, cooking dinner and cleaning up after people. She didn\u2019t even own anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right\u2014it\u2019s no vacation for her\u2014but it\u2019s a big step up from her last home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalifornia,\u201d Carmine said. \u201cOr so she thinks. She lived with a master who could\u2019ve killed her.\u201d</p><p>Vincent\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cI\u2019m surprised she told you so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked, and apparently she feels like she can\u2019t deny anyone anything when they ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s where you\u2019re wrong,\u201d Vincent said. \u201cIf the child didn\u2019t want to tell you, she wouldn\u2019t. She might be trained to serve, but she knows how to keep secrets. She wouldn\u2019t have survived as long as she has otherwise.\u201d</p><p>Carmine had no idea how to respond to that. \u201cSo, what? She\u2019s going to stay here indefinitely?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Vincent said, putting his glasses back on. \u201cAnd she isn\u2019t to leave the house without my permission, so get used to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet used to her? Really? There\u2019s seriously something wrong with the way we live.\u201d</p><p>Vincent shook his head. \u201cI know how you can be, so unless you need more help with your laundry, I suggest staying away from her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know she helped me with my laundry?\u201d</p><p>Vincent motioned toward the computer monitor on his desk. Carmine realized he\u2019d watched the exchange on the surveillance cameras. There were a few in the house, mostly in the common areas. \u201cI wasn\u2019t watching because of you. There still aren\u2019t any cameras in the bedrooms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it better stay that way,\u201d Carmine said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to see what goes on in that pigsty any more than you want me to see it,\u201d Vincent said, picking up his medical journal again. \u201cJust be mindful of what I said. I\u2019d appreciate it if you were polite and didn\u2019t try to meddle. The last thing she needs is you making things harder for her.\u201d</p><p>Carmine stood. \u201cIn other words, don\u2019t be myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrecisely, son.\u201d</p><p>Carmine arrived at school Monday morning to find Tess and Dominic arguing in the parking lot. He climbed out of the car as Dia strolled over, plopping down on the hood of his Mazda. He shoved her off, and she laughed as she took a seat on her clunker instead.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s gotten into those two?\u201d</p><p>Dia shrugged while Tess laughed dryly, pushing past Dominic. \u201cWhat\u2019s gotten in to us is the fact that your father\u2019s an idiot!\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnock it off, Tess,\u201d Dominic said. \u201cIt\u2019s not that big of a deal.\u201d</p><p>Tess glowered at him. \u201cDr. DeMarco moved a teenage girl in, and you not only fail to tell me, your girlfriend, but when I find out you say it\u2019s not a big deal?\u201d</p><p>Dia leaned toward Carmine. \u201cThere\u2019s a girl living with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but she\u2019s blowing it out of proportion,\u201d Carmine said. \u201cShe\u2019s just some girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust some girl living in a house with Mr. I\u2019ll-fuck-anything-that-walks!\u201d Tess said.</p><p>\u201cGive me a break,\u201d Carmine said. \u201cDon\u2019t act like you\u2019re upset because of me. It\u2019s not my fault you don\u2019t trust your boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>Tess gave him the middle finger before storming off, but Dominic stood there, for once not following.</p><p>\u201cThat was interesting,\u201d Dia said. \u201cYou\u2019re not really banging the girl, are you?\u201d</p><p>Dominic chimed in. \u201cThey don\u2019t even get along.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that we don\u2019t get along,\u201d Carmine said. \u201cIt\u2019s just she runs every time I come near her.\u201d</p><p>Dia laughed. \u201cIf you\u2019d relax, I\u2019m sure she\u2019d come around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never met her,\u201d Carmine said. \u201cHell, you didn\u2019t know she existed until a minute ago. You aren\u2019t exactly an expert on the subject.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s just some girl, right? We\u2019re not that complicated. Besides, I\u2019m not saying you should bang her, but there\u2019s nothing wrong with making friends.\u201d</p><p>Carmine rolled his eyes. \u201cNo one says banging anymore, Dia. The nineties are over. People fuck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot always,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes they make love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot me.\u201d</p><p>Forty-five minutes later, Carmine was strolling through the school\u2019s corridor toward his second-period class when he spotted his brother in the library. Dominic sat at a computer, furiously typing away at the keys. Curiosity grabbed Carmine and he slipped through the glass doors into the room. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cChrist, it\u2019s bright in here.\u201d Carmine shielded his eyes as his voice echoed through the silent room, but no one was around to scold him.</p><p>\u201cFirst time in the library?\u201d Dominic asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been in here for English class,\u201d he said defensively. \u201cI even checked out a book once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich book?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe Count of Monte Cristo. I had to do a report last year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you actually read it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said. \u201cI read the first page before I rented the movie.\u201d</p><p>Dominic laughed but said nothing, too busy pulling up files on the computer. Carmine leaned against the desk beside him, trying to decipher what all the coding meant. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChanging your grades for you, bro.\u201d</p> <p>His eyes widened. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I did look at them. You\u2019ll never make it out of high school at the rate you\u2019re going.\u201d</p><p>Carmine shook his head. \u201cYou have some nerve hacking the school\u2019s servers and going through people\u2019s records like this shit isn\u2019t illegal. And they say I\u2019m the one who\u2019s gonna turn out like Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t intentionally hurt people, so you still have me there,\u201d Dominic said. \u201cBesides, have you seen your disciplinary record?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think the better question is have you seen it, Dom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re damn right I have. It was like reading a true-crime novella. Your permanent high school record is longer than Uncle Corrado\u2019s arrest record, and that\u2019s saying a lot.\u201d</p> <p>Their aunt Celia\u2019s husband, Corrado Moretti, had been arrested more times in his life than he had had birthdays, but none of the charges ever stuck. Whether it was a missing witness, a dirty judge, or a bribed juror, Corrado always found a way out of trouble.</p><p>A reporter once dubbed him the Kevlar Killer. No matter what he was hit with, he came out unscathed.</p><p>\u201cUncle Corrado\u2019s the Man of Steel,\u201d Dominic said. \u201cFaster than a speeding bullet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you seriously just compare him to a superhero?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, guess I didn\u2019t think that one through.\u201d</p><p>Glancing at his watch, Carmine pushed away from the desk. \u201cI have to get to history before Mrs. Anderson sends a search party out for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you do that,\u201d Dominic said. \u201cFrom what I saw, you\u2019re not passing the class.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really not gonna change my grade for me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSorry, no can do. What does Superman say? With great power comes great responsibility?\u201d</p><p>Carmine smacked his brother on the back of the head as he walked past. \u201cThat\u2019s Spider-Man, dumbass.\u201d</p><p>Carmine got home after football practice that night in just enough time to see Haven bolt up the stairs. He washed his hands and went into the dining room where dinner waited, his father already bowing his head to pray when he sat down. \u201cSignore, benedici questi peccatori che essi mangiano la loro cene.\u201d</p><p>Lord, bless these sinners as they eat their dinners.</p><p>Carmine was eating before they could say, \u201cAmen.\u201d</p><p>Vincent tried to make conversation during the meal, and Dominic humored him, but Carmine remained silent. It was well after dark when Vincent\u2019s pager went off, and he dismissed them, needing to head to work. Carmine made his way upstairs and hesitated when he saw Haven in the library, gazing out the window with her palm pressed against the smooth glass.</p><p>He expected her to flee, but she instead motioned toward the small flashes of light sparking in the darkness. \u201cWhat are those things?\u201d</p><p>Carmine turned to see if someone else was there, taken aback that she was attempting to talk to him. \u201cFireflies. Some people call them lightning bugs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do they glow?\u201d she asked. \u201cIs it so they can see?\u201d</p><p>He strolled over to her. \u201cI think it\u2019s how they talk to each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never seen them before?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have any in Blackburn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, well, we have plenty here,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re like flying beetles with asses that light up.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at his description. \u201cThey\u2019re beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re just bugs. Nothing special.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re alive,\u201d she said. \u201cThat makes them special.\u201d</p><p>He had no comeback for that. Haven continued to gaze out the window while he watched her, seeing the childlike wonder in her expression. She looked as if she were seeing the world for the first time, like she had been blind until now but suddenly could see. He wondered if she felt that way, too, if everything in front of her was brand-new.</p><p>He tried to think back to when he saw fireflies for the first time, but he could barely recall that point in his life. He vaguely remembered catching some in a jar once.</p><p>\u201cDo you wanna see them up close?\u201d</p><p>The words were out of his mouth before he realized what he was asking. He\u2019d heard his father, but at the same time, he didn\u2019t see the harm.</p><p>She turned from the glass to look at him. \u201cCould I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>Excitement sparked in her eyes. The sight of it made Carmine\u2019s heart skip a beat. It had been years since he felt anything close to that, and for a moment, he wished he could steal it for himself.</p><p>\u201cYou mean go outside?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m not allowed.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cNeither am I.\u201d</p><p>Technically true, since he was grounded, but he\u2019d never let that stop him before.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like that,\u201d she said, pausing before adding, \u201cIf you\u2019re sure.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. She was trusting him. He wondered if maybe she shouldn\u2019t do that, but it was a vast improvement from avoiding him. \u201cWait here. I\u2019ll be back.\u201d</p><p>He ran down to the kitchen, glad his father had already left, and returned to the third floor after finding an empty mason jar. Haven stood in the same place, her hand still pressed to the glass.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d he said, heading to his bedroom. Turning on the light, he noticed she lingered outside the doorway, surveying the mess. \u201cAre you coming in? I know it\u2019s a disaster . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no, it\u2019s not that.\u201d She looked panicked. \u201cI didn\u2019t know if I should.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we can\u2019t go out the door, because my father will find out. We have to go out up here.\u201d</p><p>Her brow furrowed. \u201cFrom the third floor? How?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>He watched her locked in an internal debate before ultimately taking a step into the room. Careful not to trip over any of his belongings, she made her way to where he stood. Carmine pulled up the blinds before shoving open the large window. It squeaked a bit but gave little resistance.</p><p>Haven gaped at it. \u201cI didn\u2019t think the windows opened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cDom disabled this one from the system so I could pry it open and sneak out at night. My father\u2019s never caught on since it doesn\u2019t set off any alarms.\u201d</p><p>Carmine held the curtains aside, motioning for her to climb through, and she stepped out onto the small porch that wrapped around the floor. Carmine joined her, and she carefully followed him along the balcony to a massive sycamore tree. Thick branches extended toward the corner of the house, so close Haven touched some of the green leaves, the tips fading to brown with autumn on the horizon.</p><p>Carmine tossed the jar down from the balcony, holding his breath as it landed in the grass with a thud. Gripping the branch closest to him, he stepped over the banister and climbed into the tree. \u201cCome on, it\u2019s easy.\u201d</p><p>She peeked over the edge. \u201cI don\u2019t want to fall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou swear?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cAll the fucking time.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated before grabbing the branch like he\u2019d done and pulling herself over the banister. Carmine expertly navigated the tree, having done it dozens of times, and Haven carefully followed his path. A minute after he jumped to the ground, she landed beside him on her feet.</p><p>\u201cSee, that wasn\u2019t so bad, huh?\u201d</p><p>A hint of a smile graced her lips. \u201cI didn\u2019t fall.\u201d</p><p>Carmine grabbed the jar as Haven wandered a few steps away, her eyes darting around. Fireflies continued to flash in the darkness, the brief glows illuminating her awestruck face. Her smile grew as she reached out for one, but she pulled her hand back quickly. \u201cThey won\u2019t hurt me, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re probably ten times more dangerous than fireflies are.\u201d</p><p>Dangerous. The word made his heart rate spike. Something told him this girl was a danger to his fucking sanity.</p><p>She gently captured a firefly in her palm and stared at it with awe as the bug ran across her hand and took off from the tip of her middle finger. Soft giggles erupted from her as it flew away, catching Carmine off guard. It was the first time he\u2019d heard her laugh.</p><p>Shaking himself out of his stupor, he handed her the jar. \u201cHere, catch a few.\u201d</p><p>Carmine sat down on the ground as she took off, chasing fireflies through the yard. He laughed as she fought to catch them, the little bugs evading her grasp. Soon her laughter mixed with his, her excited cheers sounding out in the night when she managed to wrangle some into the jar. She spun and twirled, jumped and ran; all the while a smile graced her lips.</p><p>As he watched, Carmine thought she looked different from the girl he\u2019d encountered that first day. There was no awkwardness, the tension that radiated from her a distant memory. Out in the yard, under the shine of the moon, she seemed relaxed and carefree.</p><p>Haven sat down and spread out her legs, the lush grass tickling her feet. She inhaled deeply, the cool night air a far cry from the dusty shallow breaths she forced into her lungs growing up. It smelled different here, clean and crisp. Everything was green. She\u2019d never given the color much thought before, but she realized it was more than something to see. It was a feeling, a taste, a smell. It was the dampness of the grass and the shelter of the trees. It was fresh. It was comforting. Green was happiness.</p><p>Green made her belly rumble, and the feeling terrified her.</p><p>The few trees she saw in Blackburn were barren, deformed sticks jutting from the ground, but here they were giant umbrellas of leaves towering above her.</p><p>She stared at the jar in her lap, the half-dozen fireflies trapped inside flickering at regular intervals. She found it strange the way they blinked in harmony, a silent melody she yearned to hear. \u201cI wonder what they\u2019re saying,\u201d she said, shattering the silence that had settled between them.</p><p>Carmine pointed at the jar. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure this one just told that one it had a nice glowy ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the others?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, well, that one\u2019s jealous, because it wanted the one with the nice ass,\u201d he said, pointing again. \u201cAnd the others are gossiping. You know\u2014who did who, why, where, when, what-the-fuck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t realize bugs were so scandalous.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s nature. They can\u2019t help themselves.\u201d</p><p>She stared at the jar, having no idea what to make of it.</p><p>Carmine stood after a few minutes, brushing the grass from his pants. \u201cWe should head inside before we get caught. You can bring the bugs with you.\u201d</p><p>Shaking her head, she unscrewed the lid. \u201cThey should be free,\u201d she said quietly, watching as the fireflies flew away.</p> <p>Carmine grabbed her hand, pulling her to her feet, and her fingertips tingled from his touch. The sensation alarmed her. It was like electricity under her skin, running through her veins and jolting her heart. Her pulse raced as she averted her gaze, not daring to look him in the eyes.</p><p>His eyes\u2014green, like the grass and the trees.</p><p>Haven felt like she, too, was suddenly glowing.</p><p>6</p><p>Evasion became a way of life for Haven again during the next few weeks, but deep down she knew it couldn\u2019t last. As she headed downstairs one Friday to do her work, she heard the television playing in the family room, although everyone should have been gone for the day. Her pulse quickened. Every weekday she had been left alone until three o\u2019clock. She didn\u2019t like her routine being disrupted.</p> <p>Quietly, she walked to the family room and saw Dr. DeMarco sitting on the couch. He addressed her without even looking up. \u201cGood morning, child.\u201d</p><p>Bewildered, she mumbled, \u201cGood morning, Master.\u201d</p><p>Dr. DeMarco shook his head. \u201cCalling me that is unnecessary. It makes me feel like you place me on the same level as Antonelli, and I like to think of myself as a better man than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need to apologize. Call me Vincent, if you\u2019d like.\u201d</p><p>She was shocked he would ask her to use his first name. \u201cCan I get you something?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, I was waiting for you. I\u2019ve been putting it off, but your checkup needs to be done today.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened.</p><p>\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t take long,\u201d he said, finally looking at her. \u201cAnd on the bright side, you get to leave the house for a bit. You haven\u2019t been outside since you\u2019ve gotten here.\u201d</p><p>Not true, but she didn\u2019t dare correct him.</p><p>He drove her to a small brick building about ten minutes away, a white sign reading DURANTE CLINIC adorning the front above the main entrance. Unlike the busy hospital, which could be seen from the parking lot, the clinic was dark and vacant, not a soul anywhere.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re closed today, so we shouldn\u2019t have any interruptions,\u201d Dr. DeMarco said as he unlocked the front door.</p><p>\u201cWhat will we be doing?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cJust the basics.\u201d</p> <p>Haven didn\u2019t know what the basics were, and Dr. DeMarco didn\u2019t take the time to explain.</p><p>He ushered her into the building, her nerves growing with each step. They went straight to an exam room with a brown cushioned table, and Dr. DeMarco flicked on a single light. She stood in place as he explored the room, pulling out supplies and turning on machines. He grabbed her arm, wordlessly stabbing a needle into her vein. She continued to stand still while he filled vial after vial with her blood, every second that passed making her woozier.</p><p>She grew so light-headed she nearly fainted.</p><p>Dr. DeMarco weighed and measured her next before leading her to the exam table. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to take off your clothes.\u201d She stared at him, fear coursing through her, and he sighed with frustration at her terrified expression. \u201cIt\u2019s going to happen whether you cooperate or not, and I\u2019d prefer it be on good terms than from me forcing you.\u201d</p><p>Dr. DeMarco strolled over to the window as Haven carefully stripped and climbed up on the table. Her feet hung off the side, nowhere close to reaching the floor as she shielded herself with a flimsy paper gown, clinging to it as if it could protect her.</p><p>Dr. DeMarco spoke without turning around. \u201cLie back and scoot to the end of the table. Place your feet in the metal stirrups and try to relax.\u201d</p><p>She did as she was told, closing her eyes as the sound of his footsteps slowly neared.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to feel something cold down below,\u201d he explained, pulling a stool closer and sitting down as he slipped on a pair of latex gloves. \u201cIt\u2019ll be uncomfortable, but it\u2019ll be over quick.\u201d</p><p>She squeezed her eyes shut tighter when he touched her, a tear slipping through and falling down her nose. She counted in her head, trying to distract herself, and as soon as she reached ten he let go.</p><p>\u201cYou appear fine, as far as I can tell,\u201d he said, disposing of his gloves. Her vision blurred from the tears when she opened her eyes, but she could see Dr. DeMarco beside her. He injected her with a few syringes, some stinging worse than others, before he headed for the door. \u201cPut your clothes on so we can leave. I\u2019ll wait for you in the hall.\u201d</p><p>Standing, she held on to the table as her legs shook, and redressed.</p><p>Haven lay in bed that night, listening to the soft music drifting in from the library. It was the same melody as every other time, one that usually lulled her to sleep, but tonight she couldn\u2019t relax. Her skin felt taut, her muscles strained and tensed as anger and disgust crept through her. Despite scrubbing and scrubbing in the shower, she still felt dirty.</p><p>She\u2019d never been so confused before.</p><p>She\u2019d kept her distance from Carmine, wanting the strange feelings for him to stop. She didn\u2019t get why her chest felt like it would burst when he spoke, why her skin got prickly whenever he came near, or why she felt dizzy when she heard his light laughter. She barely knew him\u2014she\u2019d made a point not to\u2014but it didn\u2019t make a difference, because the feelings came anyway.</p><p>Grabbing some paper, Haven sketched a picture of Carmine, every detail of his face etched in her memory: the shape of his jaw, the curve of his lips, the arch of his eyebrows, and the angle of his nose. She remembered his eyes, the way they sparkled in the light. He had some freckles on his nose and cheeks, and a small blemish on the right side of his bottom lip.</p><p>As she lay there, she found herself wondering how she\u2019d noticed all of those things.</p><p>After she finished, she held the drawing up to look at it in the light. Something was off, the sketch flat and colorless. It didn\u2019t hold a fraction of the emotion the music carried.</p><p>Frustrated, she balled up the paper and tossed it aside.</p><p>Haven was avoiding him again . . . Carmine just couldn\u2019t figure out why.</p><p>He tried to wait it out, giving her time to relax, but he was low on patience. Insomnia plagued him, and as Carmine strolled downstairs the next afternoon, still exhausted and sore from his football game, he was determined it wasn\u2019t going to happen anymore.</p><p>Groggy, he hesitated in the foyer when Haven stepped into the doorway from the kitchen. He ran his hand through his messy hair, having not bothered to brush it. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d She glanced around. \u201cShould I be doing something?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cYou tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you hungry? I could make you some food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you need laundry done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve cleaned,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve forgotten anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t implying you did. I was making conversation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>She continued to stand there, looking at him with apprehension. As the tension mounted, he regretted getting out of bed. \u201cLook, let\u2019s watch a movie or something.\u201d</p><p>She seemed startled by his suggestion. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that an, \u2018Okay, I wanna watch a movie with you, Carmine,\u2019 or is it an, \u2018Okay, I\u2019ll do whatever the fuck you say because I think I have to?\u2019 Because you can disagree with me, you know. You can even yell at me if it\u2019ll make you feel better, but don\u2019t say \u2018okay,\u2019 because I don\u2019t know what you mean by it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>They were getting nowhere. \u201cLook, I\u2019m gonna sit my ass down on the couch. Whether or not you join me is up to you.\u201d</p><p>He turned away when she spoke again. \u201cDo you want something to drink?\u201d</p><p>His footsteps stalled. \u201cUh, sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a Cherry Coke will be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCherry Coke?\u201d</p><p>Sighing, he ran his hands down his face. It was too early for this. \u201cYeah, you know, it\u2019s cherry-flavored Coke. Hence the name, Cherry Coke.\u201d</p><p>She slipped into the kitchen as Carmine went to the family room and turned on a movie. He saw movement from the corner of his eye after a few minutes, and Haven stopped in front of him, purposely avoiding his gaze as she held out a glass of soda. He took it as she sat down beside him, keeping a bit of distance between them on the couch.</p><p>He surveyed the drink with confusion, wondering why she hadn\u2019t brought him the can, when he caught sight of the cherries floating in the glass. He took a sip of it, realizing she had made him a cherry Coke.</p><p>Dazed, he couldn\u2019t find the words to thank her. His mom had made them for him when he was a kid.</p><p>Haven watched the movie intently, pulling her feet up on the couch with her head cocked to the side. \u201cHave you seen this?\u201d Carmine asked.</p><p>She looked at him like it was a dumb question. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen anything. This is the first time I\u2019ve ever been invited to watch television.\u201d</p><p>His brow furrowed. \u201cYou don\u2019t watch TV?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t allowed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow the hell did you pass the time? Reading?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t allowed to do that, either. They didn\u2019t think it was appropriate.\u201d</p><p>He gaped at her. \u201cTeachers constantly shove books down my throat, and you had people telling you reading was inappropriate?\u201d</p><p>She smiled sadly. \u201cThey didn\u2019t want me to get any ideas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIdeas? How much harm could a book do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lot. They thought I\u2019d get it in my head that the outside world was somewhere I belonged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe outside world? You make it sound like you were living in a different universe.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged, her gaze still fixed on the television. \u201cIt feels like it sometimes.\u201d</p><p>The forty-five-foot white Riviera yacht floated on Lake Michigan, just east of the Navy Pier. The glow from the moon reflecting off the calm waters gave Vincent just enough light to see. Nothing but blackness was visible below the surface, but he\u2019d been around long enough to know what was down there. Algae. Fish. Shipwrecks. Sunken cars. Bodies.</p><p>Yes, he was aware of four people who lay at the bottom of the lake . . . or what was left of them, anyway. They\u2019d been tossed in from where he stood, the back of the hull of The Federica. The words were etched in black on the stern, named after the Don\u2019s long-dead sister. The half-million-dollar yacht was Sal\u2019s, although as far as the government knew it belonged to Galaxy Corp., a company out of Chicago that manufactured GPS chips. It was a cover for his more shady business practices, most of his extravagant possessions written off as company property. That way, if the IRS came knocking, he wouldn\u2019t have to explain how he could afford such things. He\u2019d simply borrowed them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Tax evasion\u2014Vincent admired how Salvatore made manipulation an art.</p><p>A throat cleared behind him. He remained still, staring out at the water as Sal approached. \u201cMotion sickness?\u201d</p><p>Vincent wished that were his problem. \u201cNo, just enjoying the view.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice out here, isn\u2019t it? Peaceful.\u201d</p> <p>He nodded. Peace wasn\u2019t something he experienced often, and now that he\u2019d been interrupted, he\u2019d lost it again.</p><p>Sal clasped him on the shoulder. \u201cCome inside. I\u2019d like to get this over and get back to land.\u201d</p><p>Vincent begrudgingly followed Sal, seeing two men sitting on a black leather couch as soon as he stepped into the yacht. One he was well acquainted with\u2014his brother-in-law, Corrado. Corrado was a man of few words, his silence often speaking volumes. Mezza parola, they called it. Half word. He could hold an entire conversation with nothing more than a nod of his head.</p><p>A few years older than Vincent, Corrado\u2019s thick, dark hair showed no sign of gray, a slight curl to it that gave him a boyish look. He was sturdy, lightly tanned, and statuesque. Women tended to find him attractive, but he\u2019d never shown interest in any except Celia. Corrado\u2019s mind was always on business.</p><p>Family or not, Corrado\u2019s presence put Vincent on edge. It meant something had gone terribly wrong, but the boy beside him hadn\u2019t been around long enough to learn that.</p> <p>The boy fidgeted, jittery. The doctor in Vincent surmised he was likely on something. Cocaine, he thought, but meth wouldn\u2019t surprise him. He\u2019d witnessed too much to be shocked by anything anymore.</p><p>Salvatore looked at the boy. \u201cYou\u2019ve been doing things for us for how long now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA year.\u201d Excitement radiated from his words, pride for the work he\u2019d done. He wasn\u2019t much older than Vincent\u2019s children, which meant he\u2019d gotten involved the moment he turned eighteen. Dumb young Turks.</p><p>\u201cA year,\u201d Salvatore repeated. \u201cFrom what your Capo says, you\u2019ve pulled in quite a bit of money for us . . . more so than a lot of the guys working the streets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, man. Just doin\u2019 my part, ya know? Gotta make that paper.\u201d</p><p>From the corner of his eye, Vincent saw Corrado grimace.</p> <p>\u201cI heard you\u2019ve been asking about more responsibility,\u201d Salvatore said. \u201cYou think you have what it takes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell yeah,\u201d the boy said. \u201cI\u2019ve been ready since I was born.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore pulled out a bottle of scotch, pouring four glasses. Vincent stood back, swirling his in the glass and listening as the boy bragged about the jobs he\u2019d done. Hijackings and robberies, shakedowns and gambles, but never once did he mention where the bulk of his cash came from.</p><p>\u201cDrugs,\u201d Vincent interrupted, tired of the charade. \u201cYou forgot about the drugs.\u201d</p><p>The boy blanched. Even working at such low ranks, he knew Cosa Nostra\u2019s policy: Don\u2019t get caught with drugs. Ever. \u201cWhat drugs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe ones you\u2019ve been selling out of your house,\u201d Vincent said. \u201cWe have an insider who says the police caught wind of the location.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI, uh . . . I haven\u2019t . . .\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t have time to come up with an excuse. Corrado reached into his suit coat and pulled out his gun, pointing it at the back of the boy\u2019s head. Vincent looked away as Corrado pulled the trigger, the silencer muffling the gunfire as the bullet tore through his skull. The room was void of emotion as Corrado returned his gun to his coat, Sal continuing to drink his scotch like it hadn\u2019t happened. Sickness stirred within Vincent the moment he saw the dead kid\u2019s frozen expression of fear. Bolting from the room, he ran to the deck and threw up over the side of the yacht.</p> <p>Sal joined him, eyeing him strangely, and Vincent sighed. \u201cMotion sickness got me, after all.\u201d</p><p>Corrado dragged the body up on deck, wrapping it in a tarp and chains before tossing it overboard. Vincent watched as the boy sank, disappearing into the blackness of the water.</p><p>Make that five people on the bottom of the lake.</p><p>7</p><p>Haven\u2019s head brutally thumped when she opened her eyes the following Saturday. One, two, three seconds passed before sickness rushed through her like a waterfall. Jumping up, she ran for the bathroom and collapsed in front of the toilet just in time.</p><p>An hour passed before she was well enough to get back to her feet. Clothes wrinkled and hair disheveled, she made her way downstairs, coming face-to-face on the second floor with Carmine and a girl with wildly colored hair.</p><p>She\u2019d seen Carmine a few times the past week but could never tell what he was thinking, his expression curious as he gazed at her. The attention caused her chest to swell with that unknown sensation, one she was still too afraid to confront or name.</p><p>Escaping from them before they could speak, she almost fell down the steps in haste as she went straight for the kitchen. She tried to calm her racing heart as she washed a few dishes, but an unexpected voice from the doorway only startled her more. \u201cHey! I\u2019m Dia!\u201d</p><p>The glass she was holding slipped from her hand as she turned around, hitting the floor with a clank but thankfully not breaking. \u201cUh, hello.\u201d</p><p>Dia raised her eyebrows. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>Haven stared at her. Of course she wasn\u2019t okay. She was alone and missing her mama, so confused and emotionally spent that she didn\u2019t know which way was up anymore.</p><p>Not to mention she felt like she was going to be sick again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d she whispered, looking away. She took a few deep breaths, woozy, and headed for the stairs without another word. Breathing heavily, she had to pause when she reached the top of the staircase. Her vision blurred, her chest burning as she lost her breath. Everything grew hazy as her legs gave out.</p><p>She collapsed, her head slamming into the wall as she hit the floor with a thump, the sound of a freight train rushing through her ears.</p><p>\u201cHaven?\u201d</p><p>Haven pried her eyes open at the familiar voice, incredibly close, and made out the set of green eyes hovering in front of her. She blinked a few times as Carmine backed away. \u201cMaledicalo! You can\u2019t do that to me!\u201d</p><p>Confused, her vision blurred again from unexpected tears. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t pass out like that! You looked like you were dead. Christ, I thought you were dead!\u201d</p><p>She stared at him. He\u2019d worried she was dead?</p><p>\u201cDom called my father to come check on you. You hit your head pretty hard.\u201d He brushed his hand across her forehead. His fingertips were cool against her feverish skin. He spoke again, his voice so soft she barely heard it. \u201cBella ragazza, you scared the hell outta me.\u201d</p><p>She gazed at him. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does what mean? I said you scared me.\u201d</p><p>They sat in silence, Carmine stroking her cheek with the back of his hand as he stared into her eyes. It was uncomfortable, but Haven couldn\u2019t break from his gaze. \u201cI\u2019m sorry this happened,\u201d she said. \u201cEspecially with your girlfriend visiting.\u201d</p><p>His brow furrowed briefly before he laughed. \u201cI don\u2019t have a girlfriend, but if I did, it definitely wouldn\u2019t be Dia. I have the wrong equipment for her.\u201d</p><p>Haven wasn\u2019t sure what he meant by that. Her cheeks reddened from the intensity of his stare, but before she could get her thoughts in order, Dominic\u2019s voice rang out. \u201cColpo di fulmine.\u201d</p><p>They both jumped, glancing toward the doorway. Carmine pulled his hand away. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cColpo di fulmine.\u201d A slow grin spread across Dominic\u2019s face. \u201cI don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t see it hit sooner.\u201d</p><p>Carmine\u2019s expression shifted. \u201cNo fucking way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d Dominic said. \u201cKaboom!\u201d</p><p>Carmine stormed from the room as Dominic laughed, taking a seat on the bed where his brother had been. \u201cThat boy is full of surprises.\u201d</p><p>Colpo di fulmine. The thunderbolt, as Italians call it. When love strikes someone like lightning, so powerful and intense it can\u2019t be denied. It\u2019s beautiful and messy, cracking a chest open and spilling their soul out for the world to see. It turns a person inside out, and there\u2019s no going back from it. Once the thunderbolt hits, your life is irrevocably changed.</p><p>Carmine never believed in it. Colpo di fulmine, love at first sight, soul mates . . . he thought it was all bullshit. Love was just people deluded by lust, pussy blinding men from using common sense.</p><p>He still wanted to think that. He wanted to deny it existed. But a twinge of something deep inside of him\u2014past the thick steel-reinforced, Kevlar-coated, barbed-wire fence surrounding his heart\u2014suggested otherwise. And when he saw Haven\u2019s limp body on the floor, he couldn\u2019t ignore it anymore. This peculiar girl had come out of nowhere, and he was afraid she\u2019d leave as quickly as she\u2019d appeared. That she\u2019d vanish from his life before he had a chance to know her. His chest ached at the thought, his insides on fire, and the girl who caused it was oblivious to it all.</p><p>In other words, Carmine was royally fucked.</p><p>He bolted out of the house and drove to the next town, scrounging up enough change in his car to buy a cheap fifth of vodka with his fake ID. He pulled over alongside the road and drank alone in the darkness until his mind was fuzzy and he felt nothing.</p><p>He passed out eventually and awoke the next morning, his head pounding viciously. Throwing on his sunglasses, he drove home doing the speed limit, not wanting to get pulled over since alcohol likely still coursed through his veins. He was sure his father would be about as thrilled to post bail in the middle of the afternoon as the cops would be about the loaded Colt .45 pistol concealed under his driver\u2019s seat.</p><p>When Carmine walked into the house, he found Haven asleep on the couch in the family room, and something twisted inside of him at the sight of her. She had goose bumps on her arms so he grabbed a blanket from the closet and carefully covered her before going upstairs to shower.</p><p>He grabbed some crackers from the kitchen to put something in his stomach and headed back toward the family room when Haven called his name. He ran his hand through his damp hair as their eyes met. She looked at him imploringly, and it was an invitation he couldn\u2019t refuse.</p><p>He took a seat beside her. \u201cYou feeling better today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, shifting a few inches away from him. \u201cDr. DeMarco said it was a stomach virus. I might be contagious, though, so you should keep your distance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not worried about it,\u201d Carmine said. \u201cIf you give it to me, I\u2019ll get a few days off school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you supposed to be in school now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but I\u2019m not really known for doing what I\u2019m supposed to do.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cRebel.\u201d</p><p>It surprised him how relaxed things were between them. He expected tension. Haven was quiet for a bit, her gaze drifting to his bare chest. Carmine realized she was staring at his tattoo. \u201cTime heals all wounds.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes shot to his. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy tattoo. \u2018Il tempo guarisce tutti i mali.\u2019 Time heals all wounds.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, I didn\u2019t mean to stare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. The one on my arm is a cross draped with the Italian flag, and \u2018fiducia nessuno\u2019 is on my wrist. It\u2019s usually covered.\u201d He pulled off his watch and turned his arm over so she could see the words scrawled across the veins in small script. She lightly traced the ink with her fingertips. Tingling shot up his arm from her touch, and he closed his eyes briefly at the sensation.</p><p>\u201cWhat does it mean?\u201d</p><p>He pulled his arm away and put the watch back on. \u201cTrust no one.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid they hurt?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ve felt worse pain.\u201d</p><p>Images flashed in his mind at those words, and he absentmindedly rubbed the scar on his side. He got lost in the memory until a rumbling sound brought him back to reality. He looked at Haven, realizing it was her stomach. \u201cDo you ever eat?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cEvery night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? You never eat with us.\u201d</p> <p>She hesitated. \u201cMaster Michael said someone like me shouldn\u2019t sleep in the same house as someone like you, much less sit at the same dinner table.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist, they did a job on you. Were you always with Michael?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was always around, but he didn\u2019t become my master until his parents died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere his parents just as bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrankie scared me, but he didn\u2019t hit much, and Miss Monica sometimes played with me when I was young. Michael ignored me at first, but it got worse when my mistress realized that he, uh . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe made me.\u201d</p><p>Carmine\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cMichael\u2019s your father?\u201d</p><p>She picked at her fingernails, ashamed. \u201cHe didn\u2019t mean to be.\u201d</p><p>8</p><p>For the first time since coming to Durante, there hadn\u2019t been any music last night.</p><p>Right away, Haven could feel something wasn\u2019t right, that she was intruding on a moment and seeing something she wasn\u2019t supposed to see. Something sacred. Something intimate.</p><p>But she couldn\u2019t look away.</p><p>Restless and exhausted, she had been too anxious to sleep. She rose from her bed and found Carmine in a trance in the family room. A faint glow of moonlight from the window illuminated the silent room as he sat at the piano, slumped forward and staring down at the keys.</p> <p>Carmine laced his fingers through his hair as he dropped his head down, a strangled cry echoing through the room. Holding her breath, her chest constricting, Haven took a step back and treaded lightly upstairs, relieved when she reached her room undetected.</p><p>Confusion nagged at her. She didn\u2019t know what she felt for Carmine, but seeing him in pain upset her. Her alarm grew at that realization, her heart hammering in her chest. Vulnerability would do nothing but get her hurt.</p><p>Only when Haven heard Carmine come upstairs did she gather the courage to venture back down. She made breakfast as a distraction, finishing the food when Carmine appeared. He opened the refrigerator and grabbed the jug of orange juice, brushing past her to get a glass.</p><p>\u201cSmells good,\u201d he said quietly, no spark to his words, none of that passion Haven was used to hearing. Haven fought the urge to try to smooth away the heavy bags under his bloodshot eyes.</p><p>As the boys ate, Haven figured out how to make coffee, knowing Dr. DeMarco drank it every morning. It was brewing when he walked in, his footsteps faltering a foot away. He stared at the pot before turning to her, his tone accusatory. \u201cYou made my coffee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d she said. \u201cAre you hungry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be home today,\u201d he said, ignoring her question. \u201cDon\u2019t bother me unless it\u2019s an emergency.\u201d</p><p>He stalked out without pouring any coffee.</p><p>Besides a load of Dr. DeMarco\u2019s laundry, there wasn\u2019t much work to be done that day. By noon, Haven had finished and lugged his clothes upstairs. Dr. DeMarco left his door open the days he wanted her to clean since he hadn\u2019t given her the codes to open any doors.</p><p>She pulled the hamper inside the room and opened a dresser drawer, her movements halting when she saw his shiny silver gun lying on top, across the clothes. She grabbed it by the handle, using both hands, to move it out of her way as her stomach churned. It was heavier than she expected.</p><p>The sound of a door latching captured her attention, and her head snapped in the direction of the noise. Dr. DeMarco stood just inside the room, having shut them in together. Intense fear ripped through her at his expression. His face was his usual mask of serene, but his eyes glowed with rage.</p><p>She dropped the gun as a reflex, and it landed on top of the dresser with a thump. The fire in Dr. DeMarco\u2019s eyes sparked more at the sound. He reached behind him, so careful and deliberate it was almost slow motion when he grabbed the deadbolt and turned it smoothly.</p><p>Haven\u2019s heart raced with the click of the lock. She knew it then. She had made a grave mistake. She had never seen him look like this, his eyes darkening like a tornado in the distance, tumultuous and clouded. A spark of unpredictable evil lurked beneath. Staring at him, Haven finally saw a glimpse of Vincent DeMarco. The monster.</p><p>He took a step forward. Instinctively, Haven stepped back. She backed up against the wall as Dr. DeMarco stopped in front of the dresser and carefully picked up the discarded gun.</p><p>\u201cSuch beautiful things.\u201d He reached into the dresser drawer and pulled out a gold bullet, holding it up. \u201cIt\u2019s fascinating how much devastation something so small can cause. Do you know anything about guns?\u201d</p><p>The detachment in his voice frightened Haven more, her body violently trembling. She tried to sound strong, but her voice shook as much as the rest of her. \u201cNo, sir.\u201d</p><p>He returned the bullet and shut the drawer, staring at the weapon. \u201cThis is a Smith &amp; Wesson 627 Revolver, .357 magnum, eight rounds, hollow-point bullets. I have plenty of guns, but this has always been my favorite. It has never let me down.\u201d He paused. \u201cExcept once.\u201d</p><p>He pointed the gun at Haven as he closed the distance between them, thrusting the muzzle against her throat. She gasped as the force cut off her airflow. \u201cA flick of my finger on the trigger will blow a hole through your neck. You\u2019d die without a doubt. If you\u2019re lucky, it might even be quick, but there are no guarantees. Most likely, you\u2019d be unable to speak or breathe but capable of feeling everything until you suffocate to death.\u201d</p><p>He pulled back, letting her take a deep breath, before pressing the gun to her throat again. Her chest felt like it would burst when he spoke again. \u201cShall we see what happens when I pull the trigger? I think we will.\u201d</p><p>She tried to cry out as she braced herself for the pain. It was the end. She was going to die. She squeezed her eyes shut, waiting for the explosion, and jumped at the loud click. The pressure against her neck disappeared and she collapsed to the ground in sobs, unable to stand on her feet.</p><p>\u201cLook at me,\u201d he demanded, reaching down and roughly grasping her chin. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky it wasn\u2019t loaded or you\u2019d be dead now. Understand?\u201d</p><p>She nodded frantically, hyperventilating.</p><p>\u201cGood. Now go to your room for your punishment. It\u2019s time you learn what happens when people forget their place.\u201d</p><p>Dr. DeMarco unlocked the door and stormed out with the gun. His words bounced around her frightened mind as images hit her, flashes of dead eyes gnawing at her aching chest. That\u2019s what happens when people forget their place.</p><p>Death happened. Number 33 happened. Frankie had told her to remember, and she was sure she would never forget. How could she?</p><p>She pulled herself up on shaky legs and made her way to the third floor, fear overriding all logic. Bolting straight for Carmine\u2019s room, Haven tore open the window and climbed through. Running along the balcony, she held her breath and forced herself not to look down as she scampered into the tree and shimmied down to the yard.</p><p>The moment her feet hit the ground, she ran. Trees and brush scratched her limbs as she navigated the dense forest, her heart thumping wildly. She moved as fast as her legs would carry her, having no sense of direction as she once again ran for her life.</p><p>Eventually, the forest thinned. Haven saw the clearing beyond the trees and turned in that direction, shoving branches out of her way as she broke through to the road. The squeal of tires made her stop in her tracks, and she gasped when she saw the familiar black car.</p><p>No, no, no . . . She backed away, shaking her head, but it was too late.</p><p>Dr. DeMarco grabbed her and dragged her toward the idling car. Haven begged him when she saw the open trunk, but he picked her up without much effort and threw her in with no regard. She stared at him, horrified, and his furious eyes bore into her before he slammed the trunk.</p><p>Haven flinched as she was encased in darkness.</p><p>He accelerated, the force flinging her around the trunk, her head slamming against the side of it. Sobbing, she frantically felt around for some way out. A small light came on whenever he hit the brakes, illuminating the space enough for her to see. She found a small lever and pulled it, stunned when the trunk popped open. She jolted again as Dr. DeMarco slammed the brakes, but she managed to climb out quickly. Her feet carried her a short way down the road before she was seized from behind, an arm circling her throat as a hand roughly pressed against her head. She flailed around, but his hold was too strong.</p><p>In a matter of seconds, her vision faded.</p><p>When Haven regained consciousness, she was on the floor in her bedroom, bound to the post of the bed. Dr. DeMarco stood a few feet away, watching, waiting. She let out a sob as reality slammed into her, but Dr. DeMarco raised his hand to silence her cries. \u201cDid you really think you could get away? Didn\u2019t you learn your lesson last time you tried to run? I\u2019ve told you before\u2014you can\u2019t outsmart me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t . . . I, uh . . .\u201d Her cries muffled her words. \u201cI don\u2019t want to die.\u201d</p><p>Dr. DeMarco grew rigid before snatching a roll of duct tape from the nightstand. She shook her head frantically as he tore off a piece, but it didn\u2019t deter him from covering her mouth. \u201cI want you to think about how good you have it here. Think about how lucky you are to still be alive.\u201d</p><p>He walked out, leaving her alone.</p><p>Nine years.</p><p>Nearly a decade had passed since the fateful day that changed Carmine\u2019s life\u2014the day none of them talked about\u2014and it still affected him like it was just yesterday. Nobody knew, though. Nobody knew he cried, or that he still couldn\u2019t sleep at night, but for the first time in nine years, Carmine wished someone did.</p><p>The moment he walked in the door from school that afternoon, he knew something had happened. It was a feeling in the air, a stifling silence, a sense of danger that made his adrenaline pump overtime, charring his nerves as it ran through his veins.</p><p>Carmine headed upstairs, looking around, and found his bedroom door open when he reached the third floor. A cool breeze swept through his room, the window wide-open and curtains rustling. His heart rate spiked. This was bad. Real fucking bad.</p><p>The voice behind him was icy, detached. \u201cHow did she know?\u201d</p><p>Carmine turned around, seeing his father near the stairs, nonchalantly leaned against the wall with his silver revolver tucked into his pants. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow did she know what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did she know your window opened, Carmine? Because it\u2019s my house, and I didn\u2019t know!\u201d</p><p>Carmine turned back to the window. Oh, shit. \u201cWhere is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it matter?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>His father stared at him hard. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Carmine blanched. Why? \u201cBecause it does. You\u2019re a lot of things, Dad, but . . . Christ, this? I didn\u2019t think you were this fucked up!\u201d</p><p>Vincent\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cDo you have something to say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Nothing\u2019s gonna bring her back.\u201d</p> <p>Vincent\u2019s calm mask slipped. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard me. It\u2019s not gonna change anything! She\u2019s still gone!\u201d</p><p>Those words broke something inside Vincent, severing his tenuous grip with sanity. He grabbed his gun and aimed at Carmine\u2019s head.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t shoot me,\u201d Carmine said. \u201cI look too much like her.\u201d</p><p>Vincent\u2019s hand shook, confirming it. \u201cStay away from the girl.\u201d</p><p>He meant it as a threat, but Carmine only felt relief. It meant that Haven was still there, somewhere . . . but he had no intention of keeping his distance from her.</p> <p>Time went by torturously slow for Haven as she held her position in the dark bedroom. Her muscles ached, nothing alleviating the tension. She cried until exhaustion took hold, sleep whisking her away.</p><p>A noise startled her awake later, the pain explosive the moment she opened her eyes. She faintly saw a form lurking in the shadows, her brow furrowing when she made out the sorrowful green eyes. Carmine knelt in front of her and wiped her tears before running his fingertips across the duct tape covering her mouth. \u201cLa mia bella ragazza, I\u2019m sorry this happened to you.\u201d</p><p>She studied him, her head tilted as if it would help her understand.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the anniversary of, uh . . . fuck! Why can\u2019t I say it? It\u2019s the day my mom . . .\u201d He trailed off, leaving her confused. None of them spoke of Carmine\u2019s mama. Haven didn\u2019t even know her name. \u201cI wish I could let you go, but he\u2019d kill me. No, he\u2019d kill you. He told me not to come near you, but I had to know you were okay. But, Christ, look at you! What\u2019s wrong with him?\u201d</p><p>He tucked some of her hair behind her ears, his fingers grazing over the duct tape once more. \u201cI\u2019ll be back in the morning. Stay strong, tesoro. I\u2019ll never let anything like this happen again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you awake?\u201d</p><p>Haven\u2019s eyes opened at the sound of Dr. DeMarco\u2019s voice the next morning, his tone not as callous as it had been yesterday. Squatting down in front of her, he peeled up the corner of the duct tape and ripped it off. She winced, her lips throbbing like the beat of a drum.</p><p>Dr. DeMarco freed her from the restraints, and she rubbed her burning wrists. She sat there after he left with her head slumped forward, wiping her nose on her shirt as she flexed her limbs, trying to get the cramps out.</p> <p>After a few minutes, Carmine knocked and stepped in with a glass of water. He knelt beside her. \u201cYou should drink this.\u201d</p><p>She took the water and tried to smile at his generosity but couldn\u2019t manage it. Everything hurt.</p><p>Carmine held out a small yellow pill. \u201cTake this. The kids at school would eat this shit like candy if they could. It\u2019ll take away the pain.\u201d</p><p>She took the pill and swallowed it, her voice gritty as she whispered, \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. Do you think you can get up?\u201d</p><p>Carmine held his hand out to her and pulled her to her feet, but the moment he let go, her knees gave out. He cursed and snatched her before she hit the floor, his grip firm as he pulled her into his arms.</p><p>His face softened as he carried her to his room and placed her on his bed. Confused, she lay as still as possible as Carmine disappeared into his bathroom, returning with his arms full of first-aid supplies. He dropped it all on the bed beside her and sat down, a washcloth in his hand. \u201cI need to fix you up. You don\u2019t want any of this getting infected.\u201d</p><p>Carmine washed her cheeks, the cool cloth feeling good against her skin. He brushed it across her mouth, being extra gentle, and washed the dried blood from her wrists. Haven did her best to ignore the pain, keeping her attention on his face, strained with concentration.</p><p>The pain receded as the drug kicked in. \u201cYou\u2019re good at this.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cNow, this I\u2019ve been doing my whole life.\u201d</p><p>9</p><p>Carmine paused beside the bed and stared down at Haven, her face nuzzled into his pillow. He smiled unconsciously at the sight of her as he sat down. \u201cDo you wanna talk about what happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to talk about,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI survived. That\u2019s what I do. I\u2019ll keep surviving until I don\u2019t survive anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re saying you\u2019re a survivor?\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks flushed. \u201cYeah, that didn\u2019t sound smart. I think I need a thes\u2014uh, one of those books with words.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cA thesaurus?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get you one if you promise to use it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I will.\u201d Recognition flickered across her face as her smile fell. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to read it to me, though. I can\u2019t read.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruthfully?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated. \u201cI can a little bit. People taught me, and I picked up some from closed captioning when my mistress watched the television . . . so I guess you can say I watched some television, too.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI still don\u2019t understand why it mattered to that Michael guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause smart people try to escape,\u201d she replied. \u201cThey think they can make it in the outside world. The ones who don\u2019t know anything are easier to control, and they needed to control me.\u201d</p><p>He gaped at her, surprised by her sudden seriousness. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Haven laughed, her carefree expression returning. \u201cIs that an, \u2018Okay, I get your point, Haven,\u2019 or is it an, \u2018Okay, I\u2019m just going to agree with you, because I don\u2019t know what else to say?\u2019\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d mocked him. Him. \u201cYou did that all fucking wrong. You didn\u2019t even curse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t curse.\u201d</p><p>He cocked an eyebrow at her. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen too many people have teeth knocked out from saying bad words.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo not cursing kept you all your teeth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, luck did that. As many blows to the face I took, I should be more disfigured than I am.\u201d</p><p>He scoffed. \u201cYou aren\u2019t disfigured.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy nose is crooked,\u201d she said, matter-of-fact. \u201cThere\u2019s a bump.\u201d</p><p>He squinted a bit, looking at her nose, but saw nothing wrong with it. \u201cHow\u2019d you get this supposedly horrific bump?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mistress kicked me in the face.\u201d</p><p>He cringed. \u201cWhy did she kick you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I scuffed her high heels when she tripped me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did she trip you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor fun? I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>His brow furrowed. \u201cThe bitch tripped you for laughs, got pissed because she scuffed her shoe, and decided to kick you in the nose as punishment?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cDo you want to know the color of the shoes? You\u2019ve asked everything else.\u201d</p><p>His eyes widened at her sarcastic tone.</p><p>Haven noticed his stunned expression and covered her mouth. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if you wanna tell me the color of the shoe, by all means, tell me. If you\u2019re sick of my questions, tell me to shut the fuck up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe shoe was red, and I don\u2019t mind your questions,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I had an outburst like that.\u201d</p><p>He smirked. \u201cIt\u2019s the drug. It\u2019s why, in the past half hour, you\u2019ve mocked me, gotten fresh with me, and confessed to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo when it wears off, I\u2019ll be in pain and embarrassed? Probably even in trouble, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo reason to be embarrassed,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd nothing will top you escaping out my window, so I wouldn\u2019t worry about being in trouble anymore.\u201d</p><p>She picked at her short brittle nails. \u201cDid I get you in trouble, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo more than I get myself in daily,\u201d he said. \u201cHe came up here in the middle of the night and nailed it down, though, so no more scaling trees for either of us . . . until I get it open again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI panicked,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought he was going to kill me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t . . .\u201d He wouldn\u2019t kill her? Carmine wasn\u2019t sure if he believed those words. \u201cWhy did you think that, anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said the same thing my master said when I saw him murder a girl.\u201d</p><p>Carmine didn\u2019t know what he\u2019d expected to hear, but that wasn\u2019t it. \u201cYou saw a girl die? Is that the worst thing you\u2019ve seen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. I\u2019ve seen a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike?\u201d</p><p>She averted her eyes. \u201cLike my mama being raped.\u201d</p><p>As much as those words sickened him, Carmine was immensely grateful for whatever pharmaceutical company cranked out those potent little yellow pills that made her open up. \u201cThat\u2019ll never happen to you here. You know that, right?\u201d</p><p>She nodded but didn\u2019t appear to be convinced.</p><p>\u201cLook, sex can be great between people who want it, but I\u2019d never touch a girl unless she wanted me to. None of us would. That\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you love those girls you touch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He felt bad about admitting that.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever been in love?\u201d</p><p>He stared at her, unsure of how to answer. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m still figuring out what love is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s confusing.\u201d</p><p>He pursed his lips in thought. Could she feel what he felt? He couldn\u2019t ask her, though. Even if she said yes, he couldn\u2019t be sure it wasn\u2019t drug-induced.</p><p>Leaning back on the bed, Carmine stared up at the ceiling as Haven spoke, her words slurring from exhaustion. \u201cCarmine? What\u2019s the worst thing you\u2019ve seen?\u201d</p><p>He contemplated whether to answer. It was a story he\u2019d never told anyone. His family knew the technical parts, the shit that made the newspaper, but he never talked about what he saw.</p><p>Could he tell her?</p><p>He looked at her and smiled when he saw her eyes closed, lips parted as she lay there, fast asleep. He would have told her, he realized. He would have told her everything.</p><p>When Haven woke up, muscles throbbed she hadn\u2019t been aware of. The intoxicating scent of cologne invaded her lungs, assaulting every cell in her body when she took a deep breath. It reminded her of the smell of the air in Blackburn when a storm came and it rained for two days.</p><p>Haven sat up, needing to clear her head, and stretched her back as Carmine retrieved a bottle of Tylenol. He sat down and gave her the pills before grabbing a half-full bottle of water from his nightstand. \u201cI promise I don\u2019t have any diseases.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She took it from him and drank the rest of it before handing the empty bottle back to him. He shrugged as he tossed it onto the floor in a pile of dirty clothes. The room was somehow messier than the last time she saw it. \u201cI could clean your room for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not gonna make you do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but you\u2019ve been nice. I\u2019d like to do something in return.\u201d</p><p>He raised an eyebrow. \u201cNice? Don\u2019t say that shit too loud. It might ruin my reputation. And maybe I\u2019ll ask for help with my room someday, but not today.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSomeday, then.\u201d</p><p>They were both quiet again, the silence awkward. Haven tried to think of something to say to lighten the mood, but his eyes were watching her, and she couldn\u2019t focus on anything but them.</p><p>She looked around the room again, needing to break from his gaze. \u201cI should try to move around. The longer I lie around, the harder it\u2019s going to be when I do have to get up.\u201d</p><p>Carmine helped her to her feet\u2014putting weight on her legs was not easy. He held her arm the whole way downstairs, hesitantly letting go when they reached the family room.</p><p>They sat together quietly on the couch as night fell. Carmine offhandedly flipped through channels, watching a program until commercials came on and then turning to another. A few minutes past seven, he settled on an episode of Jeopardy! \u201cThis popular pasta dish consists of wide, flat noodles layered with meat, cheese, and tomato sauce.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLasagna,\u201d Haven and Carmine said at the same time. She smiled. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUseless trivia,\u201d he said, \u201clike the bullshit they teach us in school.\u201d</p><p>She turned back to the television, eyes wide, and soaked up every question asked during the next thirty minutes. When the show came to an end, she turned to Carmine. He appeared bored, his head propped up with his fist on the arm of the couch, as he flipped through channels again.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said. \u201cI liked that show.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s on every night at that time,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know, in case you wanna watch it again.\u201d</p><p>The front door opened a few minutes later, and Haven tensed when she heard footsteps. She could feel Carmine\u2019s gaze on her, could sense it powerfully, but she couldn\u2019t look at him. She didn\u2019t want to see his expression. She didn\u2019t want his pity. He had treated her like an equal, and she didn\u2019t want to feel like less than him again.</p> <p>Dr. DeMarco walked in, an uncomfortable tension entering with him. Haven fought back a bout of sickness, focusing her attention on a smudge on the floor.</p><p>\u201cCan you go to your room, Carmine?\u201d Dr. DeMarco asked. \u201cI\u2019d like to talk to her alone.\u201d</p><p>Haven\u2019s heart raced as she picked at her fingernails, trying to keep her composure as Carmine left. Dr. DeMarco crouched down in front of her, blocking the spot she\u2019d been focused on, so she stared at a loose thread on his shirt instead.</p><p>He raised his hand, and Haven recoiled, wrapping her arms around herself protectively as she moved as far back from him as possible. The queasy feeling flared, and Haven bit her bottom lip to keep it in.</p><p>\u201cYou should stay off your legs for a few days,\u201d Dr. DeMarco said as he ran his fingers across the tops of her knees and squeezed them.</p><p>She winced. It hurt. \u201cI\u2019m fine, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have bursitis. It\u2019s when the little sac above the kneecap fills with fluid. You need to rest and ice them so the swelling goes away.\u201d</p><p>He let go of her knee but didn\u2019t get up. It was uncomfortable, him staring at her. She wanted nothing more than for him to go away.</p> <p>\u201cListen to me,\u201d he said, his voice softer. \u201cDo you know what a GPS chip is?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a tracking device, sometimes as small as a grain of rice. My car has one in it. If someone steals it, I can find its location. It\u2019s a security measure, so no one takes what belongs to me.\u201d He paused. \u201cYou\u2019re no different, child. You have one in you, too.\u201d</p><p>At those words, Haven met his gaze. Sympathy shined from his eyes, which made her sicker.</p><p>\u201cI injected you with one in the basement that first day, so no matter what happens, I\u2019ll be able to find you. It\u2019s how I knew where you went yesterday.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t speak, afraid if she opened her mouth, she\u2019d lose it. She\u2019d never had these reactions toward Master Michael. She endured years of abuse from him and could keep going, battered but strong, intact . . . but in one second, without raising his hand, Dr. DeMarco had shattered a part of her.</p><p>10</p><p>Durante fell under autumn\u2019s clutch. The lush green faded, giving way to rich, warm hues scattered among the tall pine trees. Leaves fell in heaps on the ground, covering the earth like a crisp blanket.</p><p>With the emergence of fall came Homecoming, a big extravaganza in town, with spirit week and a pep rally, a parade, and a football game, the week\u2019s activities culminating in a dance. Carmine should have been excited, but he had been dreading it all week.</p><p>Haven had been cold again, hiding out whenever he was home. He heard her crying at night as he sat in the library, whittling away the hours by plucking the strings on his guitar. He wanted to go to her, to console her, but he didn\u2019t know what to say. Sorry you\u2019re here? Sorry you\u2019re trapped? Sorry my father is a sick motherfucker? How could he explain it, make it all right, when nothing about the situation made sense to him?</p><p>It was close to six in the evening when Haven opened her bedroom door and came face-to-face with Dr. DeMarco. He stood in the hallway with his fist raised to knock, and she took a step back as he dropped his hand. \u201cMay I come in?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, confused why he would ask permission in his own house.</p><p>He entered nonchalantly, as if he were there for casual conversation, and looked around for a moment before addressing her. \u201cHow do your knees feel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>\u201cDo you think you\u2019re up for a trip out of the house?\u201d</p><p>The question alarmed her. A voice in the back of her mind screamed, It\u2019s a trick!</p><p>\u201cOnly if you say so, sir,\u201d she said, eyeing him warily.</p><p>Dr. DeMarco reached out to her. She recoiled, her heart pounding rapidly as she braced to be struck, but he dropped his hand without touching her. A frustrated sigh escaped his lips as he turned away, pinching the bridge of his nose. \u201cWe\u2019re going to Carmine\u2019s football game. Make yourself presentable.\u201d</p><p>She stood there when he left, having no idea what he considered presentable. She eventually changed into a pair of khaki pants and a sweater and brushed her frizzy hair, but nothing could tame the natural curls. She pulled it back with a rubber band and forced her feet into a pair of shoes before heading downstairs. Dr. DeMarco waited in the foyer with his hands shoved in his pockets, rocking on his heels. Hearing her approach, he scanned her. She awaited his assessment, but he said nothing as he pulled out his keys and opened the front door. Haven stepped onto the porch as he locked up the house, ushering her into the passenger seat of the car.</p><p>Durante High School\u2019s parking lot was packed when they arrived, cars lining the road and covering the field beside the school. Haven gawked at them as Dr. DeMarco parked on the grass.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve gone about things the wrong way,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve kept you in the house until you could prove you\u2019d act appropriately in public, but there\u2019s no way for you to do that until I allow you around people. So I\u2019m giving you a chance, and I expect you to be on your best behavior.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>Her knees wobbled as they made their way into the stadium. People surrounded them on all sides, shoving past and blocking their path. Dr. DeMarco glided through the crowd fluidly, while she followed, feeling like she was drowning. They encircled her, voices and bodies swallowing her like a current. Dr. DeMarco paid her no mind as they headed up the packed bleachers.</p><p>A voice carried over the loudspeaker as a band played, and cheerleaders chanted something Haven couldn\u2019t hear over the roar of the crowd. She covered her ears as everyone took their seats, only dropping her hands when it calmed down.</p><p>Familiar laughter rang out, and Haven looked in the direction of the sound. Dominic walked toward them with his arm draped around a girl, Dia begrudgingly following them.</p><p>Dominic took a seat in front of them and introduced Haven to his girlfriend. Tess stared at Haven for a moment, her gaze intense, but said not a word as she sat down beside him. Dia wedged herself between Haven and Dr. DeMarco. It startled Haven, but Dr. DeMarco simply slid over to give the girl room.</p><p>Haven turned her attention to the game, trying to ignore the people all around. She scanned the field silently as a player was hit and knocked onto his back. She winced. Ouch.</p><p>\u201cLooks like number three took a hard hit,\u201d the announcer said. \u201cLet\u2019s hope he\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s fine,\u201d Dominic said dismissively. \u201cCarmine\u2019s tough.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes darted back to the field. Carmine?</p><p>He climbed to his feet and flexed his fingers, his white number 3 jersey smudged with grass and dirt. Her mouth went dry as she gazed at it. So that was what the big black number meant.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know shit about football, do you?\u201d Dominic asked, glancing back at her. \u201cI can see it on your face.\u201d</p><p>She smiled sheepishly. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Dominic was rattling off the basics of the game, most of it lost on her, when Carmine pulled off his helmet, his skin glowing with sweat under the stadium lights. As she watched him, her breath hitched.</p><p>Carmine turned toward the bleachers, his eyes drifting in their direction as he scanned the crowd, and Haven could have sworn his gaze lingered on her for a moment.</p><p>The rest of the game rushed by, the energy in the stadium making Haven\u2019s skin tingle. People occasionally approached Dr. DeMarco, not one inquiring as to who she was. She could see it in their eyes, though, could see it in their expressions as they surveyed her from a distance, trying to make sense of her presence.</p><p>When the final whistle blew, the crowd descended upon the field. Haven followed Dr. DeMarco to the surrounding fence, her footsteps faltering on the outskirts.</p><p>Dr. DeMarco paused. \u201cDon\u2019t move from this spot. Remember what I\u2019ve told you.\u201d</p><p>The voice in her head screamed again, He\u2019s testing you!</p><p>Someone approached while she stood there, their voice an unfamiliar southern drawl like none she\u2019d heard before. \u201cLost?\u201d</p><p>Haven turned to see a boy with sun-kissed skin, his blond hair concealed under a baseball cap. He wore a pair of cargo shorts and a blue t-shirt. Haven was immediately drawn to his nearly bare feet. She smiled at them\u2014he had on flip-flops.</p><p>Her own feet felt stifled. What she wouldn\u2019t give to have a pair.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not lost,\u201d she said politely. \u201cI\u2019m waiting for someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Nicholas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, tell me something, Haven. What do you call a deer with no eyes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo-eye deer.\u201d Nicholas grinned. \u201cGet it? No idea.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She smiled when she realized it was a joke.</p><p>\u201cAh, a smile!\u201d he said, playfully squeezing her arm.</p><p>Haven\u2019s smile fell when he touched her, but he didn\u2019t seem to notice.</p><p>Murderous rage shook Carmine. He\u2019d been looking for Haven, seeking her out in the crowd, but his vision narrowed in on Nicholas Barlow instead. Carmine\u2019s feet moved on their own as he dropped his helmet on the field, running as fast as his fatigued legs would carry him. Shouts rang out as someone chased behind, but he didn\u2019t slow down. He couldn\u2019t.</p> <p>He leaped over the chain-link fence and landed on his feet as Nicholas and Haven heard the commotion. Confusion played in Haven\u2019s expression, while Nicholas narrowed his eyes.</p><p>For as much as Carmine didn\u2019t like the boy\u2014and Carmine fucking despised him\u2014Nicholas hated Carmine, too.</p><p>Nicholas backed up a few steps, but it was too late. Carmine rammed into him, tackling him to the ground. His knee landed in Nicholas\u2019s crotch and he drew back his fist to punch him, but someone snatched the back of his jersey before he could, yanking Carmine to his feet.</p><p>Vincent jumped between them, shoving his son farther away.</p><p>Nicholas looked shell-shocked as he got to his feet, hesitating for a fraction of a second before running off. Carmine would have laughed at his cowardice if it weren\u2019t for the look on his father\u2019s face. \u201cDo you know what I went through to get you out of trouble last year?\u201d Vincent asked, fuming. \u201cI\u2019m not going to do it again!\u201d</p> <p>His father stormed away, grabbing Haven\u2019s wrist and yanking her in front of him. Tears streamed down her cheeks as they disappeared into the crowd, and Carmine\u2019s gut twisted.</p><p>He\u2019d fucked up. Again.</p><p>Homecoming the year before had been significantly different. Only a sophomore at the time, Carmine was just a spectator at the varsity football game. He\u2019d sat in the bleachers, surrounded by his classmates, with his best friend\u2014Nicholas Barlow\u2014at his side.</p><p>Best friend. The words felt venomous to Carmine now.</p><p>While the circumstances had changed this year, Carmine had every intention of ending the night in precisely the same way: fucked up beyond belief. Only this time, he was alone.</p><p>People packed the after-party when Carmine arrived, dozens of bodies crammed in the small house. He slipped through the crowd, grabbing some vodka from the kitchen before heading down the hallway. The den was dark except for a small, dim lamp in the corner, the stereo playing mellow rock music.</p> <p>Everyone looked up when he entered, and a boy named Max nodded in greeting.</p><p>\u201cYou got any blow?\u201d Carmine asked him, sitting down on the couch. With the week he\u2019d had, he needed a major lift.</p><p>Max left the room, returning a few minutes later with a small baggie of cocaine. Carmine poured some of the powder out onto the table in front of them, enough for two lines. He snorted one straightaway, his nose numbing as his heart raced. After inhaling the second line, he closed his eyes and leaned back against the couch. Euphoria coursed through his body, warmth starting in his chest and radiating out through his limbs. He felt lightweight, invincible, without a care in the world.</p><p>A little while later, Lisa plopped down on his lap. Carmine\u2019s euphoria took an instant hit. \u201cIf you\u2019re gonna sit on me, you ought to at least get naked first.\u201d</p><p>Pushing her aside, he made two more lines and snorted them, desperate for the sensation back. Wiping his congested nose, he dumped the rest of the power onto the table and offered it to Lisa. She inhaled it like a vacuum.</p><p>\u201cI got you a tie,\u201d she said, leaning back on the couch beside him. \u201cIt matches my dress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA tie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, for the dance.\u201d</p> <p>The dance. Carmine didn\u2019t even remember asking her to go with him. \u201cWhat color is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFandango.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at her. \u201cWhat the hell is fandango?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s kind of like fuchsia but darker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, what, purple or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, purple.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged as he looked away. He didn\u2019t care as long as it wasn\u2019t pink.</p><p>The night was a haze of alcohol and drugs, like a movie in fast-forward that he couldn\u2019t slow down. He drank, he smoked, and he snorted, and then he popped a few pills before doing it all over again. The cycle continued, round and round, until he finally passed out where he lay.</p><p>The next morning, Carmine suffered the worst hangover of his life. His head pounded so hard his eyes pulsated. Wincing, he staggered out of the house into the sunshine, putting on his sunglasses as he climbed into his car.</p><p>The moment he pulled up in front of the house, a warm trickle streamed from his nose. Snatching down the visor, he looked in the mirror to see the blood. He pulled off his shirt and held it up to pinch his nose as he walked into the foyer, spotting his father holding a black duffel bag.</p><p>\u201cGoing away?\u201d Carmine asked, heading for the stairs, but Vincent stepped in his path.</p><p>\u201cTo Chicago, yes.\u201d He pulled Carmine\u2019s hand away to survey his bloody nose. \u201cIf you keep snorting that stuff, you\u2019re going to damage your septum.\u201d</p><p>Carmine moved away. \u201cHow do you know I didn\u2019t get punched?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause if someone had punched you in the nose, you would\u2019ve broken theirs.\u201d Vincent started toward the door with his bag. \u201cLay off the coke. It\u2019ll get you killed.\u201d</p><p>Carmine fell asleep the moment his head hit the pillow and was woken up by a knock on his door. He pulled himself out of bed, groaning, and swung it open to see Dominic. He thrust a bag at Carmine. \u201cYour date\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>Fuck. He\u2019d already forgotten about the dance.</p><p>He showered, trying to wake up, and dressed in a black suit and black shoes before grabbing the bag. Pulling out the tie, he held it up and glared at it. It was shockingly pink. Fandango, my ass.</p><p>He slipped it on, knowing he didn\u2019t have time to argue. After unlocking his bottom desk drawer, he filled a flask with vodka and slipped it into his pocket. He headed out, but paused in the library when Haven came up the stairs.</p><p>Carmine tried to think of something profound to say, something to make it all right again. \u201cThis tie makes me look fruity, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>That isn\u2019t it.</p><p>Haven burst into laughter. \u201cLike the cake.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head when she disappeared into her room. She didn\u2019t even know what he meant.</p><p>. . . Or did she?</p><p>When they reached the school, Lisa ventured off with her friends while Carmine stood along the side, drinking heavily. They danced a bit, but by the time his flask was empty, he was drunk and ready to leave. Lisa smiled seductively, and the two of them went straight to her house. Her parents were out of town for the weekend, and Lisa hit up the liquor cabinet, handing him a bottle of Southern Comfort.</p><p>She took him to her bedroom, where he drank even more.</p><p>She kissed his neck and snatched the bottle away before pushing him down on the bed. He lay there and let her strip him, watching as she slipped off her dress. Climbing on the bed, she hovered over him and leaned in for a kiss.</p><p>Turning his head, he muttered, \u201cI\u2019m not that drunk.\u201d</p><p>Her touch was uncomfortable, too intimate. She went too slowly, her hands gentle. Nothing felt right about it, her body wrong. Squeezing his eyes shut, feeling himself softening, Carmine wished he could enjoy it. He\u2019d compromised and worn a pink tie, and now his body rejected a guaranteed lay. He didn\u2019t recognize himself anymore. It was driving him nuts.</p><p>As soon as that thought ran through his mind, laughter erupted from him. Lisa moved away, startled. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you, Carmine? You\u2019re crazy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He stood and grabbed his clothes. \u201cNutty like a fucking fruitcake.\u201d</p><p>She stared with disbelief. \u201cWait, you\u2019re leaving? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t love you,\u201d he said as he headed for the door. \u201cI\u2019m never gonna love you, Lisa.\u201d</p><p>Saint Mary\u2019s Catholic Church looked like a medieval castle tucked into the heart of bustling Chicago, with its pointy towers and strong tan bricks. The grass surrounding it was withered, the sidewalk cracked, but the church was still immaculate. High arches and golden walls accented the wooden d\u00e9cor, the ivory marble floor sparkling from the sunlight streaming through the stained glass windows. When Vincent was young, he felt like he had stepped inside a treasure chest. Every Sunday, without fail, Saint Mary\u2019s made him believe he truly belonged.</p><p>Today, however, as he strolled through the vacant pews, he felt like an outcast in the place of worship. The sound of his footsteps bounced off the walls, alerting the priest to his arrival. He headed straight to the confessional and sat down as Father Alberto took a seat on the other side.</p><p>Vincent pushed the screen out of the way, knowing it was senseless to shield himself from the priest. He would know it was him\u2014he always did. \u201cBless me, Father, for I have sinned. It\u2019s been three months since my last confession.\u201d</p><p>Father Alberto made the sign of the cross before he spoke, his Sicilian accent still present even though he had lived in America for decades. \u201cWhat sins have you committed, my child?\u201d</p><p>Since his last confession, Vincent had lied, stolen, and been an accessory to murder in the name of la famiglia, but one sin weighed heavily on his mind. \u201cI hurt someone . . . a girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you intend to cause the girl harm?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you remorseful?\u201d</p><p>Another pause. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you told her of your regret?\u201d</p><p>He ran his hands down his face in frustration. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Father Alberto was quiet for a moment. \u201cWas it her?\u201d</p><p>Vincent needn\u2019t answer. They both knew it was . . . and they both knew it wasn\u2019t the first time.</p><p>\u201cI was angry,\u201d Vincent said. \u201cThe pain that morning was the worst it\u2019s been in years. I wanted someone else to hurt for once. I wanted someone else to feel what I felt. I had to get it out of me before I exploded. I needed to feel better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m still angry\u2014so angry, Father\u2014but on top of it, now I\u2019m ashamed. I want to stop feeling this way, but I don\u2019t know how to make it go away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, but I think you do,\u201d Father Alberto said. \u201cJudge not, and ye shall not be judged. Condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned. Release, and ye shall be released.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuke 6:37.\u201d Vincent recognized the Scripture. \u201cBut what if I can\u2019t stop? What if I can\u2019t let go? What if I can\u2019t forgive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMatthew 6:15.\u201d</p><p>Father Alberto smiled. \u201cYour hate is poison, Vincenzo. It eats you from the inside out. You must find it in your heart to let go. Then, and only then, will you be forgiven.\u201d</p><p>11</p><p>Haven stared at the alarm clock as the numbers rolled past midnight. Her broken hours of slumber had been interrupted by nightmares for days, and the thought of closing her eyes terrified her. She desperately wanted some peace, but she\u2019d only been offered deafening silence. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There was no music tonight. Nothing to distract her.</p><p>After the boys left for the dance, Haven spent the evening drawing and thinking about her life. As much as she didn\u2019t want to admit it, she\u2019d allowed herself to grow jealous. She longed to be the pretty girl in the pretty dress, going to a dance with the other teenagers.</p><p>Tired of wallowing, she crawled out of bed to go downstairs. She headed to the kitchen for a drink but froze when she turned on the light and realized someone was there.</p><p>Carmine sat on the counter beside the fridge, his shoulders slouched and a bottle of liquor in his hand. Their eyes met, and even from across the room she could see the passion. A lot of soul lurked beneath his hardened exterior.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to interrupt,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not interrupting, Haven. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m fucking doing anything. I\u2019m just sitting here, drinking myself into a coma.\u201d His tone startled her. She considered walking away, but he spoke again before she could. \u201cI sounded like a dickhead, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>Without answering, she brushed by him to open the refrigerator door. She pulled out the jug of orange juice and set it on the counter, reaching past Carmine to grab a glass from the cabinet.</p><p>He spoke then, his breath fanning out against her. \u201cGet me one, too.\u201d</p><p>A shiver ripped through her as she grabbed a second glass, unable to stop her reaction. Haven poured them both some juice and put the jug back in the fridge.</p> <p>Carmine\u2019s behavior confused her, but a na\u00efve part of her craved his company. Now that he was there, she had a distraction. And maybe she\u2019d even have the music again.</p><p>He tipped his bottle of liquor, grunting after he pulled it from his lips. \u201cUgh, that\u2019s rough,\u201d he said, his voice gritty. He poured some in his juice, hesitating before dumping a bit in hers. \u201cI don\u2019t like drinking alone.\u201d</p><p>Alone. Haven knew how that felt.</p><p>She sniffed the drink, scrunching up her nose. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy ask me? You can read, so fucking read the bottle.\u201d Her eyes widened, and he groaned. \u201cI sounded like a dick again. I didn\u2019t mean it like that.\u201d</p><p>Irritated, she chugged her drink. It still tasted like orange juice, but a bitter edge to it burned her throat. Carmine stared at her as she set her empty glass onto the counter.</p> <p>\u201cLa mia-fucking-bella ragazza.\u201d He chuckled, guzzling his drink. \u201cYou have potential, tesoro.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cThanks, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a compliment,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll get more where that one came from if you do it again.\u201d</p><p>He hopped down from the counter and poured two more glasses of juice, adding some liquor to both. Haven took a deep breath as she picked hers up. It was a lot stronger the second time, the burn harsher. She barely got half of it down before pulling the glass away with a cough. \u201cGoodness, that\u2019s strong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I loaded that one,\u201d he replied. \u201cDon\u2019t chug anymore. If you do, you\u2019ll pass out, and I\u2019d really like some company.\u201d</p><p>A swell of emotion shot through her, the longing returning. He wanted her company, too.</p><p>He held the bottle up. \u201cAnd it\u2019s Grey Goose vodka, in case you\u2019re still wondering.\u201d</p><p>They went up to the third floor to Carmine\u2019s bedroom. He set his drink on his desk and sat in the chair, but Haven hesitated in the doorway, unsure of what to do.</p> <p>\u201cYou can sit anywhere you want,\u201d he said, sensing her dilemma.</p><p>She took a seat on the edge of his bed and anxiously took a sip of her drink.</p><p>\u201cSo let\u2019s play a game or something,\u201d Carmine suggested. \u201cHow about twenty-one questions?\u201d</p><p>Her nerves flared. She had no idea what that was.</p><p>He took notice of her bewildered expression. \u201cWe take turns asking each other questions until we hit twenty-one. Only rule is you can\u2019t lie. I don\u2019t give a shit what it\u2019s about\u2014just no lying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She took a deep breath. \u201cYou go first.\u201d</p><p>Her hand trembled as Carmine gazed at her from across the room. He sighed and stood, taking her glass and setting it on his desk. After pulling out his keys, he unlocked his bottom desk drawer. \u201cHow do you feel about drugs? And that doesn\u2019t count as my question. I just wanna know before I do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, I don\u2019t know much about them.\u201d</p><p>He pulled out what looked to her like a cigar and lit it, the room filling with a pungent woodsy odor. He brought it to his lips and inhaled as he crouched down in front of her. \u201cThe weed will relax you, okay?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, transfixed by his proximity.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make it easy on you,\u201d he said. \u201cJust inhale and hold it as long as you can.\u201d</p><p>He brought it to his lips and sucked in deeply as he leaned toward her. Haven\u2019s heart raced as he cocked his head to the side, pausing with his lips an inch from hers. She inhaled as he exhaled, the smoke from his lungs infiltrating her system. She closed her eyes as everything clouded, only letting go when she needed air.</p><p>Exhaling slowly, she opened her eyes to see Carmine still in front of her, his staggering expression burning more than the smoke. \u201cQuestion one\u2014how did you practice reading if you weren\u2019t allowed to have any books?\u201d</p><p>She blushed. \u201cI took a book that belonged to my first master.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat embarrasses you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI confessed to being a thief.\u201d</p><p>He sat down again. \u201cYeah, well, you live with a career criminal. Thievery doesn\u2019t faze us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a career criminal?\u201d</p><p>He looked at her with confusion. \u201cNo, I meant my father. You know, with what he does in Chicago.\u201d She didn\u2019t know, and that struck him. \u201cShit, I figured . . . It doesn\u2019t matter. Ask something different.\u201d</p><p>Still confused, she pulled out something random. \u201cHow\u2019d you get that scar on your side?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist, you\u2019re not gonna take it easy on me, are you?\u201d He ran his hand through his hair. \u201cI got the scar when I was eight, bullet ripped through my side.\u201d</p><p>Haven thought maybe he\u2019d fallen or cut himself\u2014but she didn\u2019t think he would say he\u2019d been shot.</p><p>\u201cLike I said, we\u2019re more alike than you think,\u201d he continued. \u201cI shed blood over shit that wasn\u2019t my fault too.\u201d</p><p>Could they really have things in common? \u201cWhy were you shot?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s my turn. Do you have any secret talents?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I like to draw, but I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a talent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you draw something for me?\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cYou already asked your question.\u201d</p><p>He waved her off. \u201cFine, your turn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you get shot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t say, because I don\u2019t really know,\u201d he said. \u201cAsk something else.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated. \u201cWell, why did you attack that boy at the game?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause Nicholas deserved it. But knocking him down is nothing compared to what happened last time we saw each other.\u201d He muttered something under his breath before continuing. \u201cSo will you draw a picture for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe someday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeday? What does someday mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll draw for you the same someday you let me clean your room,\u201d she said. His mouth flew open like he was going to argue, so she cut him off by asking her next question. \u201cWhat did you do to Nicholas before that was so bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShot at his truck. The gas tank sparked. They accused me of attempted murder, but whatever. I honestly didn\u2019t try to kill him.\u201d</p><p>Haven was stunned he\u2019d been so violent toward the boy when he\u2019d seemed nice to her.</p><p>\u201cWhat did he say that made you smile?\u201d Carmine asked.</p><p>\u201cHe told me a joke about a deer.\u201d</p><p>He rolled his eyes. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t count as my question. Have you ever been kissed?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head slowly, feeling inadequate. \u201cThat probably makes me seem immature . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all. I shouldn\u2019t have asked that one.\u201d He nervously shifted around in his seat. \u201cHell, I haven\u2019t either, technically speaking, since I don\u2019t kiss on the lips.\u201d He paused again. \u201cAnd that probably makes me seem like an asshole, that I can have sex with them but not kiss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many girls were there?\u201d</p><p>He dropped his head at her question. \u201cA dozen and a half plus two or three, maybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo twenty or twenty-one?\u201d</p><p>He peeked at her. \u201cYou\u2019re quick at math. And that\u2019s ridiculously high, I know.\u201d</p><p>He looked upset by his own answer, and she couldn\u2019t help but wonder if he regretted some of those girls. She smiled, trying to be reassuring, but he just groaned. \u201cNew subject. Question number . . . whatever fucking number we\u2019re on. When\u2019s the most afraid you\u2019ve been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe in your father\u2019s room.\u201d</p><p>Carmine nodded like he expected that answer and turned away to grab his drink. \u201cYour turn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your mama?\u201d</p><p>She blurted it out, and her hands covered her mouth as Carmine froze, his glass midair.</p><p>\u201cChicago,\u201d he said, setting his glass down without taking a drink. He turned back to her, his blank expression surprising her as much as his answer.</p><p>\u201cChicago?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, it\u2019s Hillside, a few miles outside of Chicago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyway,\u201d he said, \u201cwhat\u2019s your favorite color?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreen.\u201d Her cheeks flushed as she answered. She lay back on his bed to avoid his gaze.</p><p>The bed moved as he sat beside her. Her eyes shot to his as he stared down at her. \u201cYour turn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your favorite color?\u201d She was too flustered to think of anything else.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m torn between deep brown and this shade of pinkish red right now. Looks kinda like my tie.\u201d</p><p>Her blush deepened, and she had to look away from him as her heart raced.</p><p>\u201cMy turn,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy\u2019s green your favorite color?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPass,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t pass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t answer some questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, I\u2019ll ask something else. Why are you embarrassed about your favorite color?\u201d</p><p>Her brow furrowed. \u201cI passed on that question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you passed on why green was your favorite color. Now I wanna know why green being your favorite color is embarrassing. Two completely different things.\u201d</p><p>He spoke matter-of-factly, as if it were just that simple.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re cheating,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I pass again.\u201d</p><p>Carmine laughed as he relit his cigar. Haven was mesmerized at the calmness of his expression as he inhaled, and goose bumps popped up on her skin at the sight of him. Maybe it was the intoxicants, but something made her feel at ease. She felt safe there, and as frightening as that was she basked in the sensation. Because never in her life had she truly felt safe with someone\u2014not even her mama. She couldn\u2019t protect her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She trusted him, when she\u2019d never trusted anyone in her life. And she knew she shouldn\u2019t, especially him. He was the son of the man who controlled her\u2014his family held her life in their hands. They could kill her, and she\u2019d be defenseless to stop it. But she trusted him anyway. She could feel it in every inch of her body, every beat of her frenzied heart.</p><p>Something about this boy had burrowed under her skin.</p><p>Carmine leaned forward, pausing an inch from her mouth. She parted her lips, inhaling everything he gave her, and closed her eyes as she tasted his breath.</p><p>His face grazed her cheek, the sparks from his skin sending tingles through her body. She could feel the slight stubble of his facial hair, rough and scratchy, as he inhaled deeply. He breathed her in, and she allowed herself to wonder if maybe\u2014just maybe\u2014this frightening creature could want the same thing she craved.</p> <p>She held on as long as she could, not wanting to let go, but her body\u2019s need for oxygen won. She exhaled as Carmine got up, but she kept her eyes closed. She didn\u2019t want to face reality yet.</p><p>Carmine slipped out of the bedroom, needing to put some space between them. She had him twisted. Up was suddenly down, left was now right, and everything surrounding him was a blur. It was difficult for him to admit he was as inexperienced as her. He could fuck a girl senseless, but when it came to loving one, he had no clue what to do.</p><p>Love. The word perplexed him. He wasn\u2019t swimming in lust anymore. This was uncharted territory, and he was fucking drowning.</p><p>Carmine walked over to the library and flicked on the light. Blinking a few times, he scanned the titles on the bookshelves, grabbing one before heading back to the bedroom. Haven lay on her stomach on his bed, her feet up by his pillows. He gave her a small smile and shut the door behind him, holding the book out to her. \u201cThe Secret Garden. Thought you might like it.\u201d</p><p>She took it. \u201cWhat\u2019s it about?\u201d</p> <p>He shrugged. \u201cA garden, maybe? A secret? I don\u2019t know. Read it and tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh . . .\u201d she started, her brow furrowing as she eyed the cover.</p><p>He chuckled. A book flustered her. \u201cLook, you don\u2019t have to. I\u2019m not gonna make you write a book report. Just thought it would give you something to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I want to! It\u2019s just . . . what if your father finds it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about him,\u201d he said. \u201cI got you covered.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes glossed over with tears as she opened it halfway. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can read this. There are a lot of different words.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, I think you can do it,\u201d he said. \u201cBesides, you have help now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelp?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I mean, if you don\u2019t want help, fine, but I\u2019m happy to do what I can.\u201d</p><p>She looked down at the book again. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he echoed her word. \u201cIs that an, \u2018Okay, I\u2019d like to do this reading shit with you,\u2019 or is it an, \u2018Okay, you\u2019re really fucking nuts if you think you can help me?\u2019\u201d</p><p>She merely smiled, the sight of it telling him it was probably a combination of the two.</p><p>He kicked off his shoes and sat down next to her, playing a few chords on his guitar as she read the book. It made him warm inside, and for a while, it felt like it was normal . . . like they were normal. Just a boy and a girl, both of them a bit fucked up, but they were just themselves.</p><p>And he savored it.</p> <p>He tried to keep his attention off her, not wanting to make her uncomfortable, but from the corner of his eye he could see the look of concentration on her face as she sounded out words. \u201cWhat\u2019s tyr\u2014uh, this word?\u201d</p><p>He set his guitar down and rolled onto his stomach, peeking over to see what she pointed at. His chin rested on her shoulder. \u201cTyrannical. It\u2019s like a tyrant. You know, like a master.\u201d</p><p>She turned to him, their faces so close the tips of their noses touched.</p><p>12</p><p>Haven stood in the kitchen, her mind wandering as she made cookies. She\u2019d slipped out of bed an hour ago, her nerves on edge about last night. Her body controlled her when she was around Carmine, her heart taking the lead over her mind. Her mind told her it was ridiculous, dangerous to spend time with him, but her heart told her it was right.</p><p>She\u2019d preheated the oven and put a batch in when there was a knock on the front door. Glancing out the window, she saw a small white car in the driveway. Whoever it was knocked again, more forceful the second time.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t open the door. The alarm was enabled, and she still didn\u2019t have a code. Quietly locked in a dilemma, she was relieved when Carmine stomped down the stairs. \u201cWhoever\u2019s at the fucking door better have a search warrant.\u201d</p><p>Haven strolled to the doorway as he answered the door. Before he could say a word, someone shoved into him, barging into the house. \u201cYou\u2019re such an asshole!\u201d</p><p>While Haven was stunned, Carmine\u2019s expression remained blank. \u201cLisa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could you do that to me last night?\u201d Lisa spat, glaring at him, the look on her face reminiscent of Mistress Katrina yelling at Master Michael. She wondered what Carmine could have done to ignite such fury, but he wasn\u2019t giving any indication of a response.</p><p>Carmine glanced toward the kitchen as Lisa repeatedly cursed at him, and he smiled when he spotted Haven watching. Lisa noticed the exchange. \u201cIs she the reason, Carmine? That bitch?\u201d</p><p>Carmine\u2019s smile fell. \u201cIf you know what\u2019s good for you, you\u2019ll shut up right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were better than that! Look at her!\u201d Lisa glared at Haven. \u201cHow much is Dr. DeMarco paying you to screw his son?\u201d</p><p>Her words set Carmine off. He grabbed Lisa\u2019s arm and swung open the front door with so much force it slammed into the wall. He pulled her out to her car while she continued to yell, flailing and trying to strike him, but Carmine ducked out of the way. He yelled back\u2014Haven couldn\u2019t hear him, but she could see his mouth move furiously\u2014and slammed his hands against the hood of her car.</p><p>The oven beeped, the cookies done. Haven pulled them out as the front door slammed, rattling things on the kitchen counter. Carmine walked in and paused beside her at the window. \u201cYou should have answered it and told her I wasn\u2019t home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t. I don\u2019t have a code.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her peculiarly as he grabbed one of the peanut butter cookies from the rack. Taking a bite, he turned away. \u201cEat a cookie, Haven. They\u2019re good.\u201d</p><p>Dr. DeMarco arrived home as Haven was putting the cookies in a container. He walked right to her in the kitchen, stopping so close his arm brushed against hers. Her skin crawled, his presence alarming, and she fought back a shudder.</p><p>Dr. DeMarco snatched a cookie before she could put the lid on. \u201cMorning, dolcezza.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood morning, sir.\u201d She paused. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDolcezza?\u201d He took a bite, smiling kindly. \u201cSweetheart.\u201d</p><p>Sweetheart?</p><p>Dr. DeMarco made a pot of coffee, something Haven hadn\u2019t dared to try since the morning everything went terribly, horribly wrong, and poured a cup before walking out. She brushed the flour from her clothes and finished cleaning before heading into the family room, where everyone had gathered. Carmine glanced at her from the spot he had taken on the couch.</p><p>\u201cDad,\u201d he said, his eyes remaining on her. \u201cI\u2019m gonna teach Haven how to read.\u201d</p><p>Fear shot through her. Dr. DeMarco raised his eyebrows. \u201cI assumed to teach someone to read, you\u2019d have to know how.\u201d</p><p>Carmine rolled his eyes. \u201cI can read.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Dominic interjected. \u201cDidn\u2019t you know? He read the first page of The Count of Monte Cristo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVaffanculo,\u201d Carmine said.</p><p>Dr. DeMarco sighed as he turned his attention to Haven. \u201cTake a seat, child.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t tell whether it was an offer or a demand, but it was safer to just do what he said. She took the empty seat beside Carmine, folding her hands in her lap, tense and nervous. Carmine, on the other hand, had his feet casually kicked up on the coffee table as he slouched with boredom.</p><p>There was a knock on the door after a while, but no one got up to answer it. They knocked again before the door opened, a female\u2019s voice ringing through the downstairs. \u201cNone of you can answer the door for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, Tess,\u201d Dr. DeMarco said as the girl strolled into the family room. Tess glanced around at all of them, her eyes lingering on Haven for longer than she was comfortable with, before squeezing in the chair with Dominic.</p><p>Haven turned to the television and tried to focus on the movie, but Carmine kept inching closer to her, his presence clouding her mind.</p><p>\u201cDoc, did your son tell you he beat up Lisa\u2019s car this morning?\u201d Tess asked.</p><p>\u201cI hit it once,\u201d Carmine said. \u201cIt only left a small dent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you better find a job to pay for that dent,\u201d Dr. DeMarco said. \u201cI\u2019m not forking the bill for you anymore, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have to pay for anything. She deserved it, busting in here like a damn interrogator.\u201d</p><p>Those words drew Dr. DeMarco\u2019s attention from the movie. \u201cWhy did she interrogate you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wants a relationship or something.\u201d</p><p>Dr. DeMarco laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s what happens when you lead girls on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever, I don\u2019t lead them on. And regardless, maybe I deserve the shit, but Haven didn\u2019t deserve to get dragged into it.\u201d</p><p>Dr. DeMarco\u2019s eyebrows rose. \u201cHow did that happen?\u201d</p><p>Carmine shrugged. \u201cWrong place, wrong time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think she meant any harm,\u201d Haven said quietly.</p><p>\u201cBullshit,\u201d Carmine said. \u201cLisa knew what she was doing.\u201d</p><p>Dr. DeMarco shook his head. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be put in the line of fire with Carmine\u2019s puttani.\u201d</p><p>Haven had no idea what puttani were, but she had a feeling it wasn\u2019t nice. \u201cI\u2019ve survived worse.\u201d</p><p>Dr. DeMarco\u2019s gaze was intense. \u201cYes, you have.\u201d</p><p>Everyone turned back to the television, but Haven fidgeted in her seat. Uncomfortable, she wanted a reason to leave the room and leaned toward Carmine. \u201cDo you want something to drink?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cYou can bring me something.\u201d</p><p>She stood up, taking a few steps toward the kitchen. \u201cDo you need anything, Dr. DeMarco?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take a bottle of water,\u201d Tess chimed in. \u201cThanks for asking.\u201d</p><p>Haven paused, frightened she had made a mistake, but Dr. DeMarco alleviated her worry. \u201cYou\u2019re capable of getting your own water, Tess. There\u2019s nothing wrong with your legs.\u201d</p><p>Haven made a cherry Coke for Carmine and grabbed a bottle of water for herself, hesitating before getting a second one. She headed back into the family room and handed it to Tess. Tess raised her eyebrows as she took the water without saying a word.</p><p>Haven sat back down and handed the soda to Carmine. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to do that. Actually, you didn\u2019t have to do any of it.\u201d He brought his glass to his lips and took a sip. \u201cI appreciate it, though.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d she said as something from the corner of her eye caught her attention. Dr. DeMarco was staring at her again.</p><p>The home phone rang then, and everyone jumped at the shrill sound. Haven hadn\u2019t heard it ring before. Her heart raced as Dr. DeMarco stood to grab it.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck is that?\u201d</p><p>Haven saw the baffled expression on Carmine\u2019s face. \u201cIt\u2019s the telephone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, I get that, but where did it come from?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged as Dr. DeMarco answered the call. \u201cDeMarco residence . . . Wait, slow down . . . How many hits did you say you had?\u201d Haven tried not to listen, but he spoke loudly. \u201cHow is that possible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously,\u201d Carmine said. \u201cWhen did we get a phone?\u201d</p><p>Dominic laughed. \u201cWeeks ago.\u201d</p><p>Dr. DeMarco raised his voice more. \u201cDo it again. If it comes out the same the second time, we\u2019ll redo the entire thing, but it has to be wrong. There\u2019s no way it\u2019s true.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t anyone tell me?\u201d Carmine asked.</p><p>\u201cThe better question, bro, is why didn\u2019t you notice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep it off the record,\u201d Dr. DeMarco continued, speaking over all of them. \u201cI don\u2019t want this getting out until I can make sense of it. Capice?\u201d</p><p>He tossed the phone down, ending the call, and pinched the bridge of his nose. His gaze drifted to Carmine and Haven, his expression unreadable, but the raging fire was back in his eyes. Standing, he snatched the cherry Coke right out of Carmine\u2019s hand, spilling some on the floor as he stalked out of the room. A moment later something crashed in the kitchen, the sound of a glass smashing as it was thrown into the metal sink.</p><p>Stunned, Haven glanced at Carmine. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, staring at his empty hand. \u201cBeats me. I didn\u2019t even know we had a damn phone.\u201d</p> <p>The door to the office on the second floor was uncharacteristically left open. Vincent sat behind his desk, his glasses low on his nose as he rummaged through files. Carmine stood in the doorway, watching him. \u201cWho jizzed in your coffee?\u201d</p><p>Vincent\u2019s head snapped up. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your problem?\u201d Carmine elaborated as he stepped into the room and took a seat, not waiting for an invitation. \u201cYou were fine and then suddenly it was like you swallowed someone\u2019s bitter junk.\u201d</p><p>Vincent shook his head. \u201cMust you always be crass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Carmine said. \u201cMust you always be evasive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly when you ask questions you really don\u2019t want the answers to,\u201d Vincent said. \u201cDid you need something? I have things to take care of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, for one, I wanna know why you took my drink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was thirsty.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo you drank it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cAny other questions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, why do you have Haven locked in here like she\u2019s on house arrest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s been outside,\u201d Vincent said, casting him an incredulous look. \u201cShe seemed to enjoy herself at your game until you had one of your episodes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of my episodes? Is that what we\u2019re calling them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless you have a better name for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d Carmine said. \u201cThe point is she rarely leaves. She doesn\u2019t even have a code.\u201d</p><p>Vincent sighed exasperatedly. \u201cWhy do you suddenly care?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause she\u2019s a person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo is Nicholas Barlow, but you never seem to be concerned about him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s different. Someone ought to lock him up, but she\u2019s just a girl. She\u2019s harmless.\u201d</p><p>Vincent looked up again at those words, blinking a few times. \u201cAre you suggesting you\u2019ve never hurt a girl before, Carmine? Because I think a few would say differently.\u201d</p><p>The room remained silent. Carmine had no response. Vincent pushed his files aside and took off his glasses, sighing. \u201cLook, she\u2019s locked inside because I don\u2019t have the time or the energy to take her anywhere, and there\u2019s no one else to do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, maybe you\u2019re right,\u201d Carmine said. \u201cI don\u2019t even have enough gas in my car to take myself anywhere right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you plan to get to school?\u201d</p><p>Carmine shrugged. \u201cSiphon the gas from your car while you sleep.\u201d</p><p>Contrary to the tension in the room, Vincent actually laughed at that. \u201cYou probably would.\u201d</p><p>Carmine smirked. He would.</p><p>Vincent opened his top desk drawer and pulled out the silver American Express card. \u201cI tell you what\u2014I\u2019ll make you a deal.\u201d</p><p>Carmine eyed him skeptically. \u201cI\u2019m listening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you the credit card back if you make more of an effort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, like keeping my room clean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said an effort, not a miracle. And what I mean is straighten yourself out. Stop the fighting, stop the drugs, pass your classes, and when I ask for a favor, I want you to actually do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough,\u201d Carmine said, grabbing the credit card before his father could change his mind. \u201cI\u2019ll make an effort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat, because I need a favor.\u201d</p><p>Carmine stared at him, not at all surprised.</p><p>\u201cWe need groceries,\u201d Vincent said. \u201cEnough stuff to last a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike food and shit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust food, Carmine. But yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you want me to get these groceries? On my own?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d Vincent said. \u201cSince you\u2019re so concerned, take the girl with you.\u201d</p><p>Carmine looked between his father and the credit card. \u201cIs this a test? Because not two goddamn hours ago you said I was still cut off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThings change, son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat changed?\u201d</p><p>Vincent shook his head\u2014evading again. \u201cYou want a chance to prove yourself? Do it. But don\u2019t screw up this time, Carmine. If something happens to the girl, there will be more dire consequences than being cut off financially.\u201d</p><p>Carmine stood up, figuring he needed to leave the room before his father came to his senses. \u201cDoes this mean I\u2019m no longer grounded?\u201d</p><p>Vincent sighed. \u201cYou\u2019ve been grounded since you were thirteen, and you\u2019ll continue to be grounded for as long as you live under my roof. Not that being grounded has ever stopped you before . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo basically, I\u2019m not really grounded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you ever?\u201d</p><p>Carmine laughed. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>13</p><p>Sunny Oaks Manor, located in the Hyde Park neighborhood of Chicago, looked like an upper-class apartment complex. The only thing that gave away its true nature was the staff, wearing the typical medical scrubs. Everyone was friendly, the facilities modern, but none of that mattered to Gia DeMarco.</p><p>Vincent had done everything in his power to make her comfortable, insuring she had the biggest apartment and as many luxuries as allowed, but she held resentment that she\u2019d been forced to move. Sunny Oaks wasn\u2019t her home, she\u2019d told him, and as far as she was concerned, it never would be.</p><p>Gia sat in her chair at the window in her front room, dressed impeccably in a blue dress and black pumps as she gazed out at the courtyard. Vincent perched on the arm of the chair across from his mother, not surprised in the least when she refused to greet him. Same story, different day.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice outside,\u201d he said, attempting conversation. \u201cWe could go for a walk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen you in months, Vincenzo,\u201d Gia said, her voice venomous. \u201cMonths.\u201d</p><p>Vincent sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s been three weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree months, three weeks,\u201d she said. \u201cMay as well have been three years. You don\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do care, but I don\u2019t live in Chicago anymore, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t remind me,\u201d she said. \u201cI hate thinking my only son abandoned his family.\u201d</p><p>Vincent knew by family she didn\u2019t mean blood relatives. She was referring to la famiglia, where her true loyalty lay. If ever there was a stereotypical Mafia wife, dedicated to the lifestyle until death, it was his mother.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t abandon anyone,\u201d Vincent said.</p><p>\u201cYou abandoned me,\u201d Gia said. \u201cYou stuck me in this hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a hospital. It\u2019s a retirement community.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t belong here,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not sick! Your father, God rest his soul, would be ashamed of you.\u201d</p><p>That was nothing new. \u201cHow about that walk now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care what these quacks say,\u201d she said, ignoring his suggestion for the second time. \u201cThey can\u2019t be trusted. They\u2019re all probably working for the government. Kennedy always had it out for your father, you know. He tried to bring him down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKennedy\u2019s dead,\u201d Vincent said. \u201cHas been for a long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that,\u201d she spat. \u201cI\u2019m not crazy.\u201d</p><p>Vincent laughed dryly. The jury was still out on that. The doctors suspected Gia DeMarco suffered from early onset dementia, but Vincent leaned toward her simply refusing to move past her glory days. She didn\u2019t want to admit life went on without her, that the world didn\u2019t stop turning the day her husband died.</p><p>Usually lucid, every now and then she\u2019d slip back to those times when Antonio DeMarco was the most powerful man in Chicago and Vincent still cared about making his parents proud.</p><p>\u201cSome fresh air would be nice, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>Gia reached up and rubbed her right ear, ignoring Vincent for the third time. \u201cMy ear\u2019s ringing. That old hag Gertrude next door must be talking about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you take aspirin today? That can cause ear ringing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the medication,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s her.\u201d</p><p>His mother was nothing if not superstitious. \u201cGertrude doesn\u2019t seem like the gossiping type.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you could tell, Vincenzo. You have the judgment of an imbecile! You and your Irish\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t start, Ma.\u201d Vincent raised his voice as he cut her off. \u201cI\u2019m not going to listen to it again.\u201d</p><p>Gia was quiet, as if considering whether or not to finish her thought, but finally changed the subject. \u201cYour sister visits me all the time. I see Corrado more than I see you.\u201d</p><p>It was a lie, but Vincent let it roll off his back.</p><p>\u201cNow that\u2019s what I call a good man,\u201d she said. \u201cCorrado\u2019s loyal. Always has been. His only flaw is he never gave your sister any babies. I always wanted grandchildren.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have grandchildren,\u201d Vincent said. \u201cTwo of them.\u201d</p><p>Gia scoffed but managed to keep her opinion to herself. She stared out the window, shaking her head. \u201cYou don\u2019t care about me, Vincenzo. You never even take me outside anymore.\u201d</p><p>Since the DeMarcos had moved to North Carolina, the boys had thrown a Halloween party every year. Vincent was hesitant to agree this year, but after a bit of pestering and a lot of promising, he caved with one strict rule\u2014Haven was to be watched at all times. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The house smelled like Pine-Sol when Carmine arrived home that afternoon, the aroma so heavy it stung his eyes. He stopped in the doorway of the kitchen, seeing Haven scrubbing the marble floor. She hummed, oblivious to his presence, and he listened as he tried to place the song.</p><p>She stood and turned around, the humming cut off by a yelp. \u201cYou\u2019re home!\u201d</p><p>He chuckled as she dropped the sponge. \u201cDidn\u2019t mean to interrupt, hummingbird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t. I was only . . .\u201d She trailed off as she eyed him peculiarly. \u201cHummingbird?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, hummingbird. Colibri. You kinda remind me of one.\u201d</p><p>He felt like an idiot as those words hung between them.</p><p>She looked bewildered. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re these little colorful birds that flutter around and hum. And, you know, you\u2019re kinda the same way.\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks flushed. \u201cYou heard me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard you a few times. It\u2019s, uh . . .\u201d He didn\u2019t know what to say. \u201cWhat song is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s something my mama used to sing.\u201d</p><p>She fidgeted, averting her eyes. Her sweatpants and tank top were splattered with soapy water, her hair all over the place.</p><p>\u201cYou should get dressed,\u201d he suggested. \u201cWe have somewhere to go, and I\u2019m sure you\u2019d rather put on something else.\u201d</p><p>She eyed him skeptically. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>She lingered for a moment before heading upstairs. He rolled his tense shoulders as he silently berated himself, wishing he\u2019d loosen up around her. His anxiety fueled hers, and the last thing he wanted was for her to avoid him again.</p> <p>It only took Haven a few minutes to return, wearing a pair of jeans and a t-shirt. He opened the front door, and Haven hesitated in the doorway before stepping on the porch. After engaging the alarm and locking up, he helped her into his car. She thanked him softly when he climbed into the driver\u2019s side, her eyes darting around as they drove. \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>Carmine opened the center console, looking for his list, before motioning toward the glove compartment. \u201cCheck in there for a piece of paper.\u201d</p><p>She did what he said, shifting things around, and blushed when she pulled out a small black box. Carmine groaned, realizing she\u2019d found the condoms he kept in the car.</p><p>\u201cChrist, I forgot they were in there.\u201d He snatched them from her hand and rolled down the window in a panic, tossing them out along the side of the road. He ignored her incredulous look, not wanting to have to explain, and waved her back to the glove compartment.</p><p>Haven searched again, grabbing a piece of notebook paper. \u201cIs this it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s it. Read it.\u201d</p><p>Wide-eyed, she stammered over some of the words. \u201cUh, chips . . . pret\u2014uh, pretzels . . . soda . . . Are we going to a store?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. That\u2019s what we need for the party. While we\u2019re there, we\u2019ll stock up the house. You know, kill two birds with one stone.\u201d</p> <p>When they made it to the store, Haven\u2019s footsteps faltered as the doors opened on their own. She surveyed them, almost as if she was afraid to go through. Carmine waited for her to grab a cart, but she just stood there.</p><p>\u201cHave you been grocery shopping much?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI\u2019ve never been inside a store.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever.\u201d</p><p>This would be more complicated than he thought. \u201cI can\u2019t say I\u2019ve ever done this either. I\u2019m not usually trusted, so I guess we\u2019ll figure this shit out together.\u201d</p><p>Haven tried to hand him the paper, but he instead handed her a pen. \u201cYou do the list. Practice makes perfect, right?\u201d</p><p>Before she could argue, he grabbed a cart and led her to the produce section. \u201cI have another confession. I can\u2019t say I\u2019ve ever cooked either, so I have no idea what half this shit is.\u201d He picked up a green stalk and eyed it skeptically. \u201cWhat the fuck is this?\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cThose are Brussels sprouts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely not buying them,\u201d he said, throwing the stalk down on the display.</p><p>It was quiet so early in the afternoon, only a few shoppers in the store other than them. Carmine was grateful for the privacy. Haven was clearly out of her element, clutching the list tightly as her eyes monitored everything. \u201cWhat should we get?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you wanna cook,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve noticed, but Dom will eat anything. Hell, he\u2019d eat Brussels sprouts. And my father isn\u2019t hard to please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged.</p><p>\u201cFinicky,\u201d she said to herself.</p><p>He blinked a few times. \u201cWhat did you call me?\u201d</p><p>She looked guilty as she repeated the word. \u201cFinicky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father taught you that, didn\u2019t he?\u201d he asked. \u201cHe\u2019s been calling me that for years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDr. DeMarco did mention it, but I didn\u2019t mean any disrespect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said. \u201cBut whatever, let\u2019s shop. We look like idiots just standing here, like we\u2019ve never done this shit before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t,\u201d she reminded him.</p><p>\u201cI know that, and you know that, but the rest of these fuckers don\u2019t need to know it.\u201d</p><p>They made their way through the aisles. Carmine did most of the work, packing the cart full of junk food while Haven picked up the essentials he bypassed. He watched her those moments, as she grabbed milk and eggs and bread, her shoulders relaxed and movements confident.</p><p>She handed the list to him once everything had been crossed off, and they headed to the register. He put their stuff on the conveyer belt and reached toward the display of candy. Haven flinched as his arm shot out so he slowed his movements as he threw a chocolate Toblerone bar on the conveyor belt.</p><p>After paying, Carmine stuffed the trunk with all of the bags while Haven stood in the vacant parking lot beside the car. He wasn\u2019t paying her any attention as he returned the cart to the store, and his stomach sank when he turned around. Haven wasn\u2019t standing there anymore.</p><p>Panic erupted inside of him as he scanned the parking lot, searching for some sign of her. His father was going to kill him. All it took was ten seconds\u2014ten measly fucking seconds of his guard being down\u2014and she\u2019d slipped away, vanishing.</p><p>He hastily ran to the car, movement inside of it nearly buckling his knees. Haven sat in the passenger seat, seatbelt clipped in place and hands folded in her lap. He had to take a moment to collect himself, to savor the feeling of relief, before climbing in beside her with his candy bar.</p><p>He opened the Toblerone and pulled off a triangle for her, watching with confusion as she gawked at his hand. \u201cDon\u2019t you like chocolate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never had it.\u201d</p><p>He thrust it at her. \u201cChrist, girl, take this shit, then.\u201d</p><p>She laughed at his enthusiasm and took it, biting off a small corner of the chocolate. Her expression brightened, her words escaping as a moan. \u201cWow, that\u2019s sweet.\u201d</p><p>Pulling off a few triangles for himself, Carmine handed the rest of the Toblerone to her. \u201cI know. Fucking amazing.\u201d</p><p>It was drizzling when they arrived at the house, so Carmine parked as close to the porch as possible. \u201cUnlock the door, okay?\u201d She started to interject, but he cut her off. \u201cThe code\u2019s 62373. Punch it into the keypad and hit the big-ass button. Can you remember that?\u201d</p><p>\u201c62373,\u201d she repeated.</p><p>She ran to the door, pressing the numbers as the rain came down harder. Once she had the door open, he climbed out and grabbed some bags. Haven tried to head back outside when he reached the foyer, but he threw his hand out to stop her. Her arms flew up protectively in front of her, so he quickly withdrew his hand. \u201cShit, I didn\u2019t mean to scare you. I just don\u2019t want you to get wet.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a look that seemed to be a mixture of confusion and amusement before she took the groceries into the kitchen. He unloaded the car and tried to help, tossing things where he figured they went, but he only made the job harder by getting in her way.</p><p>Dominic brought pizzas home for dinner, and Carmine grabbed a box of pepperoni before plopping down on the couch. Glancing at Haven, he patted the cushion beside him. Her eyes darted toward the stairs, and he cocked an eyebrow at her as if to say, Don\u2019t fucking dare. He would have dragged her back. There was no reason for her to not eat with them.</p><p>Carmine awoke the next afternoon to a house in total chaos. Tess and Dia stood on chairs in the family room, tacking streamers around the window, while Haven sorted through a box of fake flowers. Dominic ran from one room to another, following orders barked at him from Tess.</p><p>Sneaking into the room, Carmine grabbed Tess\u2019s chair and vehemently shook it, startling her. Yelling, Tess leaped off the chair, and he covered his head as she punched him in the back. \u201cYou\u2019re such a jerk, Carmine!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, you hit like a little girl.\u201d The words barely left his mouth when her fist shot out, punching him right in the chest. He winced. \u201cDamn!\u201d</p><p>Tess smirked. \u201cWho\u2019s the little girl now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently me,\u201d he said, rubbing his chest as he eyed his brother, arranging flowers he\u2019d gotten from Haven. \u201cI\u2019m starting to feel like one, anyway, in a room full of bitches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you call me?\u201d Haven\u2019s voice had an edge he\u2019d never heard from her before.</p><p>His brow furrowed until it dawned on him what he\u2019d said. \u201cAh, shit . . .\u201d Bitch. \u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>She turned back to the flowers without a word, handing more of them to Dominic, and Carmine watched her before approaching. Leaning close, his lips beside her ear, he whispered, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean it that way.\u201d</p><p>She said nothing. Guilt tugged at his chest. He couldn\u2019t tell if she believed him.</p><p>After the house was decorated, Carmine put on his pirate costume, sliding on the black pants and boots before buttoning up the white ruffled shirt and tying the red bandanna around his head. Grabbing the big black hat, he headed down to see Dominic in the foyer, wielding a sword.</p><p>\u201cWhich dumbass gave him a weapon?\u201d Carmine called out, barely evading the plastic blade as his brother swung it at him. \u201cYou people should know better by now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one gave it to him,\u201d Tess said, stepping out of the family room in her devil costume. \u201cHe found it on his own.\u201d</p><p>Shaking his head, Carmine headed toward the office under the stairs, punching in the code to unlock the door. The room looked like a normal office, with a wooden mahogany desk and a black leather chair. A Persian rug covered the floor, and Carmine folded the corner, exposing the hidden door. He opened it and headed down the flimsy stairs into the basement, flicking on the light. A subtle glow came over the room, revealing dozens of wooden crates.</p><p>Using the front of his shirt to cover his hand, he pulled the top off the one closest to the stairs and grabbed a few bottles of liquor. He didn\u2019t go any farther, having no desire to venture to the back. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He wasn\u2019t sure if it was subconscious fear or if his father had shown him at some point, but he never left his fingerprints down there.</p><p>Once he had the liquor, he headed upstairs in time for the guests to arrive.</p><p>Haven sat on the edge of her bed, picking at her fingernails as sickness stirred in her stomach. She felt out of place, afraid to go downstairs, worried that with one look they\u2019d all know what she was. They\u2019d all know she didn\u2019t belong in their world with them.</p><p>There was a soft knock on the door before Dominic peeked in. \u201cCan I come in, Twinkle Toes?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course,\u201d she said.</p><p>He strolled in, using a sword like a walking cane, and sat beside her on the bed. He leaned back on his elbows and things grew quiet as Dominic stared off into space. She wondered why he was here instead of at his party, but she remained silent and let him speak first.</p><p>\u201cNella vita: chi non risica, non rosica,\u201d he said. \u201cIn life: nothing ventured, nothing gained. My mom used to tell us that. It\u2019s been a long time, but I can still hear her.\u201d</p><p>He smiled to himself, remembering, as Haven conjured her own mama\u2019s voice in her mind, never wanting to forget what she sounded like.</p><p>\u201cMom taught us a lot, but that\u2019s what I remember most. You shouldn\u2019t be afraid to take risks. It might not work out, you might fail miserably and get hurt, but you\u2019ll never know unless you try.\u201d He paused, sighing. \u201cYou can play it safe, Haven, and I wouldn\u2019t blame you for it. You can continue as you\u2019ve been, and you\u2019ll survive, but is that what you want? Is that enough?\u201d</p> <p>Haven had no answer for that.</p><p>\u201cOr you could take a risk,\u201d he continued. \u201cI know you have it in you. I can\u2019t promise you\u2019ll get everything you want, but I can promise nothing will change if you don\u2019t try.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, absorbing his words, as Dominic\u2019s expression turned somber. \u201cCarmine wasn\u2019t always such an asshole, you know. He used to be like Mom, couldn\u2019t hurt a fly, but all that changed. Carmine will take physical risks\u2014sometimes I wonder if he has any regard for his life\u2014but anything emotional is out of the question. You\u2019re good for him that way. You\u2019re the first girl he\u2019s looked at as a person and not an object.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cWhy am I different to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you remind him of Mom, but he\u2019s the only one who can really answer that.\u201d Dominic stood. \u201cSo, tell me. Are we going to play it safe, or are we going to put ourselves out there?\u201d</p><p>The party had been going for more than an hour, and there had yet to be any sign of Haven. Carmine strolled through the crowd searching for her and found Dia alone in the kitchen. She had on a colorful dress and bright blue tights, a yellow beak on her nose that matched her sneakers.</p> <p>\u201cHey, Polly,\u201d he said, nudging her. \u201cHow come you look the most normal on Halloween?\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cHar-har-har. Funny.\u201d</p><p>A group of girls burst into the room then, and Carmine groaned when he saw Lisa dressed like a cat in a black bodysuit. \u201cWho invited her?\u201d</p><p>Dia grabbed his arm and pulled him out of the kitchen before Lisa could corner him. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure you did when you were going out with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t go out with her,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was more like getting into her a few times.\u201d</p><p>She cringed. \u201cGross.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, I blame you. You should\u2019ve warned me against doing it . . . or her. Whatever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried! You wouldn\u2019t listen.\u201d</p> <p>The two of them stepped into the foyer just as Haven emerged from the stairs, wearing a shiny gold dress. Fake coins hung from the edges, costume jewelry hanging around her neck with a small crown in her hair. \u201cShe\u2019s my treasure?\u201d</p><p>Dia patted Carmine\u2019s cheek condescendingly before walking away.</p><p>Haven paused in the foyer as Carmine stepped forward, taking her hand. \u201cBella ragazza.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes sparkled as she gazed at their hands. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>He smirked, pulling her toward the kitchen without an answer to mingle with the crowd. She was attentive, smiling and greeting people like she\u2019d been entertaining company her entire life. Watching her fascinated Carmine, the way she adapted easily to her surroundings. He couldn\u2019t help but think they\u2019d done the world a grave injustice by keeping her locked away.</p><p>They were in the kitchen getting drinks when somebody turned the music louder. Carmine grabbed Haven\u2019s hand to twirl her around. She laughed, losing her balance, and Carmine pulled her to him. Buzzing from the alcohol, he wanted nothing more than to feel her close. He gripped her hips and swayed her tense body to the music. \u201cRelax, tesoro.\u201d</p><p>The anxiety in her expression lessened. \u201cWill you ever tell me what anything means?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTesoro\u2019s kinda like sweetheart, but it means treasure . . . which, right now, you literally are.\u201d</p><p>She blushed, shyly looking away from him, and he took the opportunity to dip her backward. Yelping, she wrapped her arms around his neck and giggled when he pulled her back up. Their noses rubbed together, and he froze when Haven cocked her head to the side and softly brushed her lips against his.</p><p>Her strawberry gloss smeared on his mouth, and he licked his lips, too stunned to do anything but stare. Haven backed up a few steps, retreating, and he grabbed her arm when he realized she was about to run. Yanking her to him, he eagerly kissed her without another thought.</p><p>It was passionate and messy, seventeen years\u2019 worth of kisses rolled into one stolen embrace. Haven kissed him back, her lips parting as they moved with his. Running her hand along the back of his head, she laced her fingers in the hair by his neck as she trembled, but whether from nerves or excitement, Carmine wasn\u2019t sure.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit!\u201d</p><p>They broke the kiss at the sound of Dominic\u2019s voice. He stood in the doorway to the kitchen, gaping at them. Haven slipped away, bolting from the room before either of them could stop her.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to barge in.\u201d Dominic smacked Carmine on the back. \u201cBut, man, I didn\u2019t expect to see that.\u201d</p><p>Carmine shook his head, dazed. He hadn\u2019t expected it either.</p><p>Haven stared in the bathroom mirror, bringing her hand up to her mouth, lips tingling from the force of Carmine\u2019s kiss. Her mind worked rapidly as she tried to sort it out. Did it mean he felt the same sparks she did?</p><p>Someone pounded on the door, saying they needed to use the bathroom, and Haven slipped back out, wanting to look for him. She asked Dia, who pointed her to the stairs.</p><p>She ran up to the third floor and spotted Carmine in front of her room with a group of boys. A smile tugged her lips as she approached him, and he returned her smile, but it faded fast when the boy standing next to him whispered, \u201cFresh meat?\u201d</p><p>It happened as fast as the flicking of a light switch, smile turned to scowl as hands clenched into fists. Without saying a word, Carmine grabbed the boy and shoved him into the wall, punching him straight in the mouth. People shouted, heading straight for the chaos, as Carmine kicked and hit, unleashing his rage on the boy.</p><p>\u201cIf you even look at her again,\u201d he spat, \u201cI\u2019ll fucking kill you!\u201d</p><p>Haven gasped and ran into her room, locking the door behind her.</p><p>The pounding on the door vibrated the walls, ripping Haven back to another time.</p><p>Bang. Bang. Bang. Haven lay huddled in the corner stable, covering her ears, but it did nothing to muffle the sounds. She didn\u2019t know what was happening\u2014her mama was gone when the banging woke her up.</p><p>Bang. Bang. Bang. It grew louder with time. Where was her mama? Haven squeezed her eyes shut, counting in her head to make it go away. She made it to six before she lost her place, starting over but never reaching ten.</p><p>Bang. Bang. Bang. There was whimpering and crying, but it didn\u2019t come from her. It felt startlingly close but so far away, a place Haven couldn\u2019t reach in the darkness.</p><p>Bang. Bang. Bang. She heard the voice then, malicious and low. He hissed like a snake as he spoke the scathing words, \u201cIf you tell anyone, I\u2019ll fucking kill you.\u201d She didn\u2019t know who said it or what they shouldn\u2019t tell, but the crying grew louder at the sound of them. \u201cI promise I won\u2019t,\u201d another voice spoke, this one heartbreakingly familiar. \u201cJust please\u2014I beg you\u2014leave my baby girl alone.\u201d</p><p>Bang. Bang. Bang. It faded, but the silence did nothing to comfort her. She opened her eyes, hoping it was a nightmare, but the first thing she saw was her monster\u2019s vicious face. He stood just outside the stall, buckling his pants as he ogled her.</p><p>Her stomach felt as mangled as her monster\u2019s deformed skin. Her chest ached from crying, a void deep inside her. Her mama came back that night, trembling as she hugged her, but she wasn\u2019t there now to calm Haven\u2019s fears.</p><p>\u201cHaven?\u201d Carmine\u2019s voice was soft, his banging now a subtle tap on the door. \u201cFuck, I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to scare you.\u201d</p><p>14</p><p>Vibrant red blood splattered the white wall in the library. Haven was cleaning it with a rag when Carmine\u2019s bedroom door opened. Disheveled, he glared at her. \u201cWhat are you doing? You shouldn\u2019t be doing that!\u201d</p><p>He snatched the rag from her hand as her eyes welled with tears. Overwhelmed and exhausted, she couldn\u2019t take him looking at her that way, disgust and anger shining from his eyes. His hand flew in her direction and she recoiled, moving out of his reach. She stumbled and plopped down on the floor.</p><p>His face clouded with confusion as he dropped his hand. \u201cI can\u2019t get anything right with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said, not understanding. She was only trying to clean up the blood.</p><p>He groaned, throwing the rag down as his voice rose with passion. \u201cYou\u2019re sorry? For what? Ci\u00f2 \u00e8 scopare pazzesco! I\u2019m gonna lose my mind if we don\u2019t stop doing this dance!\u201d</p><p>Dance? \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>He grabbed her arm, and the zap of tingles coursed through her. She wondered why he was touching her, an irrational part of her wishing he\u2019d never stop. When he touched her, she didn\u2019t feel so alone. When he touched her, she felt alive for once.</p><p>\u201cTell me you don\u2019t feel that, and I\u2019ll back off.\u201d</p><p>She stared at his hand. \u201cYou feel it too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I feel it. I kissed you last night!\u201d</p><p>She blinked a few times. \u201cBut I kissed you. I shouldn\u2019t have, because you told me you didn\u2019t . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou barely grazed my lips. I practically assaulted your mouth.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cAnd you\u2019re right\u2014I don\u2019t do that, which is what makes it so crazy. I\u2019ve been trying to tell you that.\u201d</p><p>He ran his fingers through his unkempt hair as he stared at her, his eyes imploring her, but for what she didn\u2019t understand. \u201cTell me what?\u201d</p><p>Her question was met with silence. He slumped against the wall and brought his knees up, wrapping his arms around them. \u201cI would\u2019ve cleaned up the blood,\u201d he said. \u201cI caused it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWas the boy okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s like a cockroach.

If you want to blame anyone, blame me. Punish me. But please don\u2019t keep hurting them.

It\u2019s just, I feel . . .\u201d He hesitated, taking a deep breath. \u201cLook, it\u2019s not because I think you belong to me\u2014it\u2019s because I want you to be mine.\u201d</p><p>Her brow furrowed. \u201cIs there a difference?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat didn\u2019t sound right. Christ, I care about you, okay? I overreact because I don\u2019t want anyone to hurt you. And maybe that doesn\u2019t make sense, considering I\u2019m hurting you more than any of those assholes, but I don\u2019t do it intentionally. You\u2019re not like anyone I\u2019ve ever met. You can understand me the way no one else ever could.\u201d He scooted closer to her. \u201cLa mia bella ragazza.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I don\u2019t know what that means,\u201d she said, blushing from the intensity of his stare.</p> <p>He ran the back of his fingers along her flushed cheek. His touch was soft, and she leaned her head in his direction. \u201cMy beautiful girl,\u201d he said.</p><p>She took in his expression. \u201cYou think I\u2019m beautiful?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re beautiful, Haven. I know you are.\u201d</p><p>His words flustered her. \u201cYou are, too.\u201d</p><p>He smirked. \u201cYou\u2019re saying I\u2019m beautiful?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cA beautiful person.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been called everything under the sun, but a beautiful person was never one of them.\u201d</p><p>Never in Haven\u2019s life had she encountered a disaster like the one that met them downstairs. Trash was scattered throughout the rooms, beer cans and empty bottles littering the tables and counters. Food was smashed into the floor, the house smelling wretchedly like the inside of a trash can. There was broken glass in the family room, furniture moved, and things out of place.</p><p>Haven stood at the bottom of the stairs, scanning the mess, as Carmine disappeared into the laundry room. He returned with some black trash bags. \u201cYou start in the kitchen, and I\u2019ll go deal with whatever got broken. I know not everything survived the night intact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this,\u201d she said. \u201cI can get it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you can, Haven,\u201d he said. \u201cJust let me try to help.\u201d</p><p>She went into the kitchen and cleared off the counter, hearing noises every few minutes as Carmine tossed things around the family room. She got all the cans picked up and lugged the bag over to the side of the room. She was washing the dishes when Carmine appeared, dropping a second trash bag on the floor.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do those by hand,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a dishwasher.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how to operate it.\u201d</p> <p>Carmine opened the dishwasher and pulled out the top rack. \u201cGet your hands out of that nasty water and fill this up.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him cautiously. Considering he couldn\u2019t operate a washing machine, she had a feeling he didn\u2019t know what he was doing, but she conceded and loaded it with the dishes. When it was filled, he smiled proudly\u2014whether proud of himself or of her, she wasn\u2019t sure.</p><p>Carmine squeezed in some soap and latched the door, narrowing his eyes as he pressed a few buttons. It made noise right away and he snatched his hand away with surprise.</p><p>Haven laughed as soon as he walked out, knowing she\u2019d been right\u2014he was guessing.</p><p>She did some laundry before walking back into the kitchen. The moment she neared the sink, she hit a slippery spot, and her feet came out from under her. She grabbed the counter to stay upright and looked around, her eyes widening at the bubbles pouring out of the dishwasher.</p><p>\u201cCarmine!\u201d There was no way that was normal. Footsteps hastily approached as he sprinted into the kitchen. She opened her mouth to warn him, barely getting the words, \u201cWatch out!\u201d from her lips before he hit a patch of sudsy water and slid.</p><p>\u201cFuck!\u201d he said, treading through the soapy mess to the dishwasher. Frantic, he pushed buttons and yanked on the door, trying to get it to stop. It continued to ooze bubbles, and he groaned as he slapped the front of it. Temper flaring, he kicked the door, and Haven winced as his foot left a small dent on the front.</p><p>He cursed and hobbled, smacking the buttons again until the dishwasher abruptly stopped.</p><p>\u201cI think we have a little problem here,\u201d Haven said, the entire thing too much for her to take. The kitchen floor was covered, and they\u2019d managed to make a bigger mess than they\u2019d started with. She cracked a smile, fighting to keep a straight face, and covered her mouth to quiet her impending giggles.</p><p>Carmine cocked an eyebrow at her. \u201cAre you laughing at me?\u201d</p><p>She laughed, her body shaking with amusement at his expression. She stepped away from the counter, not paying attention, and lost her footing in the suds. Carmine shot forward to catch her but skidded too, his feet coming out from under him. He knocked them both to the floor. She landed on her back with a thud, losing her breath as Carmine landed on top of her.</p><p>He pulled himself up, horrified. \u201cChrist, I didn\u2019t mean to knock you down! Are you hurt? Did I hurt you? Huh? Did I? Say something!\u201d</p><p>She pushed herself up as he sat on the floor in front of her. Covered in bubbles, her back was soaked, and Carmine stared at her like she\u2019d grown a second head. She shook again and covered her mouth to hold it in, but it was fruitless. She laughed uncontrollably, so hard her sides ached. \u201cI think you did something wrong with the dishwasher, Carmine.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed a handful of soap bubbles and flung them at her. She turned her head so they splattered her chest and cheek, and she didn\u2019t hesitate before flinging some right back. They hit him directly in the face, and he closed his eyes as he wiped the bubbles away.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you did that!\u201d He lunged at her with a determined look on his face. She scampered backward, but he caught her before she could get away. He pushed her back on the floor and hovered over her, pinning her down in the hot sudsy water.</p><p>She flicked more bubbles at him, a little clump hitting his nose, but it backfired. Leaning down, he rubbed his face against hers, transferring them onto her. Haven cocked her head then, feeling brave, and kissed him. His lips were soft and wet, the flavor of him sweet but minty. There was a bitter tang there, and she wrinkled her nose. \u201cYou taste like soap.\u201d</p><p>Chuckling, he grabbed her hand to pull her up and brushed some bubbles out of her hair. \u201cHow about we clean this mess up so we can talk.\u201d He glanced around. \u201cAnd nap. I\u2019m definitely gonna need a nap.\u201d</p><p>15</p><p>After the house was together, the kitchen floor so clean Carmine could see his reflection in it, the two of them headed upstairs. Haven went to her room to shower as Carmine stripped, tossing his clothes onto the massive pile of dirty laundry. He desperately needed them washed, but he felt like an asshole asking her to do it. Did girlfriends do that kind of stuff for their boyfriends? He wasn\u2019t sure, considering he\u2019d never had one before.</p><p>Hell, he wasn\u2019t sure if she was his girlfriend. All he knew was she\u2019d stolen his heart, and there was no way he could ask for it back. In such a short time she\u2019d taken him over, as much a part of him now as the air he breathed.</p><p>Fucking thunderbolt.</p><p>He pulled on a pair of shorts and grabbed his stereo remote, scanning through stations as he plopped down on his bed. He was exhausted, his eyelids closing, and he drifted into a light sleep until the bed squeaked. Haven sat beside him, so he pulled back the comforter and motioned for her to join him.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to wake you,\u201d she said, lying down.</p><p>\u201cI was resting my eyes,\u201d he said. \u201cYou look better, by the way. Not to say you looked bad to begin with, just that you look good after your shower. Yeah, that didn\u2019t sound right. Ignore me.\u201d</p><p>She laughed at his tongue-tied rambling and reached out, hesitating with her hand midair. He smiled reassuringly and closed his eyes, enjoying her light touch as she explored his face. She ran her fingers down his nose and across his forehead before threading them through his hair.</p><p>When he looked at her again, her expression stunned him. She looked awestruck, her hand stilled on his cheek, her eyes glassed over with unshed tears. \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cDo you . . . ?\u201d She stroked her thumb across his cheek, sending tingling through him. \u201cDo you really feel that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like you have static under your skin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think it is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cColpo di fulmine?\u201d he suggested. She stared at him, and he smiled. \u201cI guess you\u2019re gonna want a translation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s when you\u2019re drawn to someone so forcefully that it\u2019s like being struck by lightning.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that an, \u2018Okay, you\u2019re an idiot, Carmine, but whatever you say,\u2019 or is it an, \u2018Okay, that shit makes sense?\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt makes sense,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to make of it. It\u2019s all new, and I don\u2019t know what you expect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t expect anything, tesoro,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t lie, I\u2019m attracted to you, but we\u2019re only gonna do what you wanna do. We\u2019ll be whatever you want us to be. But I just want a chance. I\u2019m asking you for a chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA chance to what?\u201d</p><p>A chance to what? A chance to prove himself? To be happy? To be trusted? To be loved? To love her? To finally be someone worthwhile? \u201cJust . . . a chance. I can\u2019t promise it\u2019s gonna be easy, or that it\u2019s gonna be all happiness. I\u2019ve never done any of this before, so I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing. But I\u2019ll try to be good to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing either,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWe can learn together. Just tell me what you want from me, and we\u2019ll figure the shit out.\u201d</p><p>She smiled, but he could sense her apprehension. \u201cYou make me happy. I, uh . . . I don\u2019t like being here when you\u2019re not around.\u201d</p><p>That had to have been hard for her to admit. \u201cI can\u2019t predict the future, but I\u2019ll do anything I can for you. You\u2019re taking a chance on me. I appreciate it, and I\u2019m not gonna take that shit for granted.\u201d</p><p>He pressed his lips to hers softly, and she smiled when he pulled away. \u201cWow.\u201d She ran her fingers gently across his lips. \u201cYour mouth is surprisingly sweet for saying such naughty things.\u201d</p><p>He burst into laughter. \u201cI think you\u2019re delirious. How about we take a nap before you tell me I smell like sunshine or something.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou do smell like sunshine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how does sunshine smell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt smells like the outside world. Warm. Happy. Safe.\u201d She paused. \u201cGreen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreen?\u201d</p> <p>She nodded. \u201cDefinitely green.\u201d</p><p>Tarullo\u2019s Pizzeria was a small establishment, owned by second-generation immigrant John Tarullo. He was what they called an omu de panza, a man with a belly, and La Cosa Nostra rewarded him for it. He minded his own business and looked the other way, and in exchange for his silence they made certain he thrived. Tarullo didn\u2019t like relying on the mob\u2014in fact, he\u2019d told Vincent many times he detested the organization\u2014but if it weren\u2019t them, it would be someone else. Someone would come around expecting something from him, and it was better that that someone at least be a familiar face.</p><p>Vincent, personally, felt protective of the pizzeria. Tarullo had been the one to find Carmine the night he\u2019d been shot, and Vincent would forever feel indebted to the man for saving his son.</p><p>It was something Tarullo would rather forget, though.</p><p>They never had much trouble at Tarullo\u2019s Pizzeria, since everyone knew it was under protection after what Tarullo had done for Carmine, so Vincent was shocked when he received a call to go to the place years later. The moment he stepped inside the restaurant and heard the loud, disruptive voices, his hand settled on the gun concealed in his coat.</p> <p>He stood still, surveying the men at the front counter, both Caucasian with sandy hair. Vincent assessed them as they bickered, their voices slurring. He wasn\u2019t sure why he\u2019d been called in for such a petty situation, but when the drunken men\u2019s focus shifted to Tarullo, he took a step forward anyway. He barely made it three feet from the door when it opened, a single word booming through the pizzeria. \u201cZatknis!\u201d</p><p>Shut up. It was one of the only words Vincent knew in Russian. He\u2019d heard it barked many times in his life from the lips of the man now standing a few feet from him.</p><p>Vincent glared at him. He was tall and built like a linebacker, his gray hair concealed under a black cap. Although he was pushing seventy, the man had the mind-set of a psychopathic twenty-year-old assassin.</p><p>\u201cIvan Volkov,\u201d Vincent said. \u201cYou\u2019re not welcome here.\u201d</p><p>Ivan stared at him blankly for a moment before turning around and walking out of the pizzeria. Before the door could close, he stepped back in. \u201cI do not see your name on the sign.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need to own the place,\u201d Vincent said. \u201cYou have no business being in this part of town.\u201d</p> <p>Despite the fact that Vincent was fuming, Ivan had the audacity to smile. \u201cWhy are you always serious? We have only come for pizza.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo somewhere else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I wish to eat here.\u201d</p><p>The two men stood at an impasse, Vincent\u2019s hand still hovering near his gun. Ivan was unaffected, though, and appeared impatient as he scanned the price menu on the wall.</p><p>The door opened again as Corrado walked in. He didn\u2019t look at Ivan as he stepped around him. \u201cVolkov.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMoretti.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause I\u2019ll be forced to kill you if you don\u2019t, and I\u2019m wearing my favorite shirt. It\u2019ll ruin my night to get your filthy blood on it.\u201d</p><p>Ivan said nothing in response as Corrado casually strolled up to the counter. The two men moved out of the way when Corrado reached into his coat. Everyone tensed, a suffocating silence blanketing the room, but instead of pulling out his gun, Corrado retrieved his wallet. \u201cI need a small deep dish with sausage and mushrooms. Light on the sauce. You know how I like it.\u201d</p><p>Tarullo rang him up, the chime of the register magnified in the edgy restaurant. \u201c$17.78.\u201d</p><p>Corrado handed him a fifty and told him to keep the change.</p><p>Ivan sighed, motioning for his guys to leave before turning to Vincent. \u201cWe will see each other again.\u201d</p><p>Vincent nodded. \u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>The Russians left, their voices loud once more as they stepped into the street. Vincent looked at his brother-in-law. Corrado eyed him peculiarly as he leaned against the counter, waiting for his pizza. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to provoke us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Vincent said. \u201cDid you get a call to come here too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I wanted some pizza.\u201d</p><p>Vincent stared at him. \u201cYou know we\u2019re expected to meet Sal for a sit-down, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Corrado said, looking at his watch. \u201cBut I\u2019m hungry.\u201d</p><p>Sit-downs to la famiglia were nothing like the movies. When he was growing up, Vincent envisioned elaborate meetings held like court, and he\u2019d laugh, imagining his father in a black robe with a gavel, sitting on a bench while the parties argued their sides. The guilty man lost and justice was served, another case put to rest.</p><p>No, sit-downs were nothing like that. They more than often happened while on a casual stroll, sometimes adjourning with no words spoken. You didn\u2019t plead your case, and it didn\u2019t matter if you were innocent. Judgment had been passed before you showed up.</p><p>Vincent stood near the pier overlooking Lake Michigan. The Federica floated not a hundred feet from him, a woman moving around on deck. She looked young, maybe late twenties. A goomah, a mistress, attracted to the lifestyle and turned on by the power they held. Vincent thought them to be nothing but glorified prostitutes, exchanging sex for gifts and trips abroad.</p><p>\u201cIs Carlo coming?\u201d Giovanni asked. Vincent turned away from the yacht, glancing around at the men gathered. Giovanni looked frozen, bundled up in a thick coat.</p><p>Sal shook his head. \u201cHe\u2019s gone back to Vegas.\u201d</p><p>Carlo had taken over their operations in Las Vegas a few years back, so he rarely appeared in Chicago anymore. Vincent resented him for the special treatment he received. He\u2019d moved away, too, but was still expected to show up.</p><p>\u201cSo, fourteen pinched,\u201d Sal said, getting down to business. \u201cTwo stool pigeons singing.\u201d</p><p>There was collective grumbling among the men. Fourteen members of La Cosa Nostra had been arrested and two had turned state\u2019s evidence, cooperating with the government.</p><p>\u201cYou gonna silence them?\u201d Squint asked.</p><p>Vincent looked at him, still wary the boy was invited to these meetings. \u201cThere\u2019s too much heat. They\u2019re being guarded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d Squint said. \u201cTake out the families. They\u2019ll get the message.\u201d</p><p>Vincent and Giovanni both opened their mouths to interject, but Corrado\u2019s voice rang out before they could. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He leaned against his Mercedes, clutching the box of pizza and devouring it like he hadn\u2019t eaten in weeks. He said nothing else, no explanation, but that didn\u2019t surprise Vincent. He\u2019d said all he needed to with that one word.</p><p>\u201cCorrado\u2019s right,\u201d Sal said. \u201cJust lay low until we know more.\u201d</p><p>Squint grumbled to himself while Corrado continued to eat. Giovanni shivered, and Vincent grew impatient as Sal\u2019s attention drifted to the yacht. They spoke a bit more as Vincent\u2019s mind wandered, only returning to the conversation when the Russians were mentioned.</p><p>\u201cThey were at Tarullo\u2019s tonight,\u201d Vincent said.</p><p>\u201cDid they hurt anyone?\u201d Sal asked. \u201cOr did it get handled?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was handled.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cNo reason to dwell, then.\u201d</p><p>Giovanni tried to interject, but Sal gave him a look that closed the subject. He waved his hand, silently dismissing them, and Corrado was in his car without having spoken another word. Vincent turned to walk away but was stopped by the Don\u2019s voice. \u201cHow\u2019s my godson?\u201d</p><p>Vincent\u2019s blood ran cold at the question. \u201cHe\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he doing well in school? Passing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s squeaking by. Still skipping a lot.\u201d</p><p>Sal laughed. \u201cDoesn\u2019t surprise me. This business, la famiglia, is in that boy\u2019s blood. And that\u2019s everything, you know. Famiglia. That\u2019s what matters.\u201d</p><p>Vincent had nothing nice to say about that, but Sal didn\u2019t wait for a response. Reaching into his coat, Sal pulled out a thick manila envelope and held it out to Vincent. \u201cGive this to Principe for me. A little something from his godfather.\u201d</p><p>Begrudgingly, Vincent took it before heading to his car. Once inside, he shoved the envelope of cash into his glove compartment. He had no intention of giving it to his son.</p><p>Haven took a seat at the library window while Carmine grabbed his guitar, joining her. Wordlessly, she picked up a book from the small table between them. Carmine smiled when he saw it was The Secret Garden. \u201cSo you haven\u2019t given up on that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, opening it to a page about a quarter of the way in. \u201cIt\u2019s good. She searches for the garden and makes friends with this little robin. It reminds me of . . .\u201d</p><p>She trailed off as Carmine plucked the strings of his guitar, random notes sounding out in the room. \u201cReminds you of what?\u201d he asked when she didn\u2019t continue.</p><p>\u201cIt reminds me of when I was little and talked to the animals,\u201d she said. \u201cThey had a few dogs, but it was mainly horses. I stayed in the stables with them.\u201d</p><p>Caught off guard, his finger plucked the wrong string. They both cringed from the sharp note. \u201cYou slept with the fucking horses?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but it wasn\u2019t so bad. They kept me company.\u201d</p><p>His jaw clenched as he held back his temper. She could say it wasn\u2019t bad if she wanted, but Carmine couldn\u2019t think of a more inhumane scenario.</p><p>He continued to strum his guitar, playing around with sounds as she quietly read. Her eyes would occasionally drift over the top of the book, settling on him. \u201cCan I ask you something, Carmine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you shoot at Nicholas last year?\u201d</p><p>Another sharp note rang out. Of all the things she could ask, she wanted to talk about Nicholas? \u201cWe had a falling-out after I messed around with his sister. He got mad and ran his mouth, said something about my mom, and I snapped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mama?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she\u2019s in Chicago?\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cHillside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s she doing there?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated. \u201cNothing. She\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean like . . . dead?\u201d</p><p>Carmine cringed at the word and nodded.</p><p>He played again as Haven went back to her book. He felt no judgment, no disappointment, no pressure to explain. It wasn\u2019t until that moment that he realized how much he craved that acceptance. She\u2019d changed him. He wasn\u2019t sure how, but he felt different. He was Maura\u2019s son again, and not so much Vincent DeMarco\u2019s heir.</p><p>\u201cLook at the Suburban.\u201d</p><p>Corrado\u2019s voice was nonchalant, but Vincent knew better than to believe he wasn\u2019t on alert. He waited a few seconds before turning, seeing the black Chevy Suburban parked along the curb half a block away.</p><p>The darkly tinted windows obstructed the inside view, but Vincent could manage a guess or two at who was there. \u201cFBI, you think?

Russians?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s law enforcement.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMust be a rookie on his first stakeout,\u201d Vincent said. \u201cOr else they\u2019re intentionally letting themselves be seen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEither way, I\u2019m offended. What do they take me for? An idiot who wouldn\u2019t notice or a coward who would be intimidated?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe they aren\u2019t here for you,\u201d Vincent said. \u201cMaybe they\u2019re watching me.\u201d</p><p>Corrado shrugged. \u201cIt would make more sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re the idiot who wouldn\u2019t notice.\u201d</p> <p>If Vincent weren\u2019t a mature man, and if his brother-in-law wouldn\u2019t punch him for it, he would have certainly rolled his eyes then.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell Sal,\u201d Corrado said. \u201cIf they\u2019re lurking, we\u2019ll want to take precautions.\u201d</p><p>Corrado headed inside his house with a nod while Vincent strolled down the block. He pulled a set of keys from his pocket as he stepped onto the porch of the white two-story house, using the worn copper key to unlock the front door. The smell of mothballs was strong, dust tickling his nose when he stepped into the corridor. Heat wafted around him, the place muggy from being closed up for so long.</p><p>Vincent strolled through the empty downstairs, the sound of his feet on the wood echoing off the barren walls. An ache in his chest made it hard to breathe, and although Vincent blamed it on the thick air, he knew it was emotional torment eating him up instead.</p><p>In the front room, he leaned against the wall and closed his eyes. He could see it then, the sunlight streaming through the open windows, air blowing in and stirring the blue curtains. The house was cluttered with furniture and knickknacks, family photos covering every inch of space.</p><p>And he could hear it, footsteps running in the hall upstairs, the squeals of excited children as they played hide-and-seek. Music streamed from a small radio, the sounds of Mozart and Beethoven.</p><p>And Vincent could feel it, the warmth and love, the happiness he craved. It was pure chaos, but it was his peace. It was his home. There was nothing else like it.</p><p>And there she was, like always, fluttering around the house in her flowing summer dress, bare feet on hard wood, toenails painted soft pink. She smiled at him, green eyes twinkling.</p> <p>But when Vincent opened his eyes again, it all faded away. He was left with nothing but darkness, silent except for his strangled breaths in the vacant room. He still slept there sometimes when he visited, even though there was no electricity or furniture. He would lie on the bare floor and stare at the white ceiling, time wasting away as he wallowed in memories.</p><p>Not tonight, though. He couldn\u2019t stay.</p><p>The black Chevy Suburban was gone when he went back outside.</p><p>Haven lay awake that night, unable to sleep. She had spent her life belonging to other people, but for the first time she felt like she actually belonged. It wasn\u2019t about being a possession\u2014it was being a part of something. People never cared what she thought before, but Carmine did. He asked, and Haven found she wanted to tell.</p><p>She gave up trying to sleep around dawn and headed downstairs, surprised to hear noises in the family room. Dominic lay on the couch in his pajamas, the lights off but television playing. He sat up when he spotted her, patting the cushion beside him. \u201cJoin me.\u201d</p><p>She sat down, folding her hands in her lap. \u201cI\u2019m surprised you\u2019re awake so early.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t sleep,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy are you up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought I\u2019d come downstairs and make sure the house was clean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo rush,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019ll probably be a few days before my father shows up again.\u201d</p><p>She eyed Dominic curiously. \u201cHe\u2019s gone a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, been that way for as long as I can remember,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s always something for him to do somewhere that isn\u2019t here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does he do when he\u2019s gone?\u201d</p><p>He laughed wryly. \u201cDon\u2019t know, and don\u2019t want to know. Dad moved us here years ago so we wouldn\u2019t be a part of that. Said he wanted us to have a normal life, so we could live like normal kids, but there\u2019s nothing normal about raising yourself, you know? Nothing normal about the situation with you. We\u2019ve all suffered because of the things he\u2019s done, and I hate to think how much more we\u2019d suffer if we knew the shit we don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, confused, and he smiled at her expression.</p><p>\u201cIn other words, Twinkle Toes, ignorance is bliss.\u201d</p><p>Vincent slipped a hundred-dollar bill into the collection plate and sighed as his mother waved it on. She hadn\u2019t donated to the church in years, convinced the altar boys were stealing the money for drugs and prostitutes, even though most of them were still in grammar school.</p><p>Celia and Corrado put in their share, and the four of them sat silently as the collection plates made their way through the crowd. Corrado remained standoffish as usual, while Vincent\u2019s sister was her typical poised, smiling self. Celia was a tall, slender woman, her face with a soft, round look. She had sleek black hair, the color of night, and dark eyes to match.</p><p>The pews were packed. Vincent scanned the congregation. Most of the ranking members of la famiglia were there, dressed in their best suits in the front of the church. It was a big production for them, the one day of the week where they could flaunt their money and pretend to do good. It made the honest men\u2014the galantuomini\u2014feel protected, men who respected them, who trusted them, who were less likely to rat them out.</p><p>After donations were collected, people made their way into the aisle. A long line formed for communion, but Vincent stayed in his seat. Corrado eyed him peculiarly, but didn\u2019t say a word as he got in line.</p><p>The rest of the service passed quickly, everyone standing as the final prayer was spoken. Father Alberto made the sign of the cross when he finished. \u201cMay you go in peace.\u201d</p><p>They were headed to the exit when Father Alberto called Vincent\u2019s name. The hair on the back of his neck bristled like a child being reprimanded. \u201cYes, Father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t take communion,\u201d Father Alberto said, his face etched with genuine concern. \u201cYou haven\u2019t taken it in weeks.\u201d</p><p>It had really been months, but Vincent didn\u2019t correct the priest. \u201cI keep forgetting to fast before service.\u201d</p><p>Father Alberto knew he was lying. \u201cThe church never closes. You don\u2019t need an appointment. God is always here for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, Father. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>Vincent left before Father Alberto could press the matter and joined his family on the front steps of the cathedral. Corrado and Celia stood along the side as Gia infused herself into the crowd. Mafiosi surrounded her, listening as she rambled away about the past. They smiled and laughed, urging her on, but not a single person mocked her. She was a former Don\u2019s widow, the mother of a consigliere, and an in-law to another made man. The men respected her, bat-shit crazy or not.</p><p>And while she lived in Sunny Oaks, respected was something Gia didn\u2019t feel.</p><p>Vincent waited as his mother finished telling a story about Antonio and one of their adventures back when Vincent and Celia were young. He found himself smiling as he thought about those days. It was before tragedy had struck. Before Maura and the kids. Before the Antonellis and the girl. Before Salvatore\u2019s family had been murdered. Before the world had imploded around them.</p><p>Gia turned to him when she finished, the crowd disbursing and saying their good-byes.</p><p>\u201cMa, are you ready to\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t take communion.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. He\u2019d planned to ask if she was ready to head back to Sunny Oaks, but it was senseless now. She wouldn\u2019t go until she had said everything she wanted to say. \u201cI couldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Gia smiled. \u201cI\u2019m proud of you.\u201d</p><p>He stood frozen as those words sunk through his thickened skin. Never in his life had he heard them from her. She must be demented. \u201cYou\u2019re proud of me?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cYou see it now, don\u2019t you? After all these years, you understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnderstand what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you were living in sin. Your marriage wasn\u2019t recognized by the church.\u201d</p><p>Vincent\u2019s smile fell. Not demented, just evil. \u201cIt was recognized.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were young, Vincenzo. And she was Irish! She wasn\u2019t even like us!\u201d</p><p>Celia responded before Vincent could. \u201cMaura was Catholic, Mom. It was sanctified. Father Alberto was the one to marry them.\u201d</p><p>Gia glared at her daughter before waving her hand dismissively. \u201cHow was I supposed to know? I didn\u2019t even get invited.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d been invited, of course, but she had shunned the service. Antonio had shown up out of respect for his son, but Gia refused. In her mind, if she didn\u2019t see the wedding, she could go on acting as if the marriage didn\u2019t exist.</p><p>\u201cYou were invited,\u201d Vincent said. \u201cYou chose not to come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d Gia said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know anything about it until it was over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s true, Ma, how did Dad know to come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that have to do with anything? Your father always snuck around, never told me anything. What makes this any different?\u201d</p><p>Vincent tried to keep his anger at bay. \u201cBecause I handed you the invitation. You took one look at it and tossed it in the trash.\u201d</p><p>Gia scoffed. \u201cAnd the quacks say I have memory problems. That never happened.\u201d</p><p>Corrado strolled over, his hands in his pockets. \u201cWhat are we arguing about now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVincent marrying Maura,\u201d Celia said. \u201cAgain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d Corrado said. \u201cI regret I wasn\u2019t there.\u201d</p><p>Gia laughed. \u201cThey didn\u2019t invite you, either?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I was invited. I just didn\u2019t think it was appropriate for me to attend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee!\u201d Gia looked at Vincent. \u201cI told you it wasn\u2019t a real marriage. Corrado agrees!\u201d</p><p>Corrado started to correct her, but Vincent shook his head. Although it stung that his brother-in-law had skipped the wedding, sending Celia to the ceremony alone, Vincent understood. Unlike Gia, Corrado meant well.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what anyone else thinks,\u201d Vincent said. \u201cI know it was real.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Haven spent the morning cleaning and finished near three o\u2019clock when she heard cars outside. The alarm beeped and the front door opened as she stepped into the doorway to the kitchen, a few voices carrying through the house. Dr. DeMarco walked in with two men behind him. The hair on the back of Haven\u2019s neck stood up at the sight of them.</p><p>Dr. DeMarco\u2019s eyes met hers. She realized these men were probably like Master Michael\u2014uncaring and cold, with no regard for people like her. They were like that part of Dr. DeMarco she\u2019d seen in his bedroom. They were dangerous. More monsters.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, she stepped forward to gauge his reaction. The corner of his lips turned up, and she took his reaction to mean she should stay. Her legs trembled as she walked into the family room, where they gathered, the men taking notice of her right away.</p><p>\u201cBring us a bottle of scotch and some glasses,\u201d Dr. DeMarco told her with a flippant wave. Haven scuttled to the kitchen. She searched the cabinets until she located the alcohol, and she scoured through the bottles, finding a brown one in the back with GLENFIDDICH SINGLE MALT SCOTCH WHISKEY written on it. She wiped off the unopened dusty bottle and juggled three glasses on her way back to the family room. She delivered the drinks, too nervous to make eye contact with any of them.</p> <p>\u201cSo this is the girl.\u201d</p><p>Haven chanced a peek at the man who spoke, his voice grating like metal scraping against glass. An air of authority surrounded him as he sat in the center, the others flanking him. He was clearly older than them.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Dr. DeMarco said. \u201cIt\u2019s her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m curious, Vincent,\u201d the man said. \u201cDo you think she was worth it?\u201d</p><p>Dr. DeMarco\u2019s bitter laughter sent chills down Haven\u2019s spine, putting her more on edge. \u201cPersonally or as business?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPersonally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course she wasn\u2019t worth it.\u201d</p><p>She lost her breath, his words striking her hurt. Had she been that much of a disappointment?</p><p>\u201cBut speaking as a businessman,\u201d Dr. DeMarco continued, shrugging, \u201cshe\u2019s a hard worker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo she wasn\u2019t a bad investment?\u201d the other guy asked. Haven looked at him. Investment? Their eyes met, his the cold drab shade of a knife\u2019s blade. Her skin crawled at their interest in her. She had to look away.</p><p>\u201cYou could say that.\u201d Dr. DeMarco shifted position and cleared his throat. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you start dinner, child? My guests will be joining us tonight.\u201d</p> <p>Haven\u2019s heart raced as she fled into the kitchen, leaning against the counter to take a few deep breaths. Dominic arrived home while she stood there, and he greeted the men in the family room before joining her. \u201cYou look worried,\u201d he said, grabbing a soda from the refrigerator.</p><p>\u201cNervous,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>Dominic sighed, opening his drink as he leaned against the counter. \u201cDoes it help to know they make me uncomfortable, too?\u201d</p><p>It did help a bit, but not enough to eliminate her fears. \u201cDo you know why they\u2019re here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBusiness, I guess. Like I said, I don\u2019t get involved.\u201d He took a drink, shaking his head. \u201cI do know the man in the gray suit, Salvatore, is in charge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the other?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis name\u2019s Nunzio. We used to hang out when we were kids, but he\u2019s no friend of mine now.\u201d</p><p>Footsteps approached an hour later as Haven cooked dinner, and the man named Nunzio appeared in the doorway. His eyes lingered on her as she deliberately concentrated on the food, ignoring the crawling of her skin, hoping he\u2019d go away after he saw what he came to see.</p> <p>He strolled toward her as she stirred the pasta. The tension in her body made her muscles ache, her hands trembling more with each calculated step. Repulsed shudders tore through her when she felt his breath on her skin. \u201cYou\u2019re prettier than I expected you to be,\u201d he said, running the back of his fingers lightly down her exposed arm. \u201cI think we could have some fun together.\u201d</p><p>His hand came to rest on her hip. Haven squeezed her eyes shut, wanting him to remove it.</p><p>At that moment, something struck her from the side, a shove hurling her into the stove. Her hand slammed against the pot of boiling water. Blistering pain made her eyes snap back open, and she grabbed her burned palm as Dr. DeMarco pinned Nunzio against the counter beside her, the serrated edge of a kitchen knife pressed to his neck.</p><p>His voice was hard. \u201cDon\u2019t touch my property, Squint.\u201d</p><p>Nunzio scowled at him. \u201cI hear you, Doc.\u201d</p><p>The blade of the knife came close to piercing the skin where Nunzio\u2019s neck pulsated, his heart pounding. Dr. DeMarco took a step back, and Nunzio glared at Haven before storming from the room.</p><p>The knife dropped onto the counter with a clang as Dr. DeMarco marched in her direction. She recoiled from him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Ignoring her flinching, he snatched her hand and barked a few orders on how to care for her burn. He turned then to leave the room but hesitated, eyeing the pot of boiling water. \u201cYou\u2019ll be eating dinner with us tonight, so be sure to set yourself a place at the table, too.\u201d</p><p>Carmine pulled in the driveway after football practice, seeing the black rental sedan parked out front. The sight of it put him on edge. His father hadn\u2019t come back from Chicago alone.</p><p>He heard Salvatore\u2019s voice the moment he hit the foyer. Carmine gave Haven a quick glance in the kitchen before making his way to the family room.</p><p>Salvatore smiled as he entered. \u201cAh, Principe!\u201d</p><p>Carmine kissed the back of Salvatore\u2019s hand when he held it out, fighting off a cringe. If ever there was a custom that made his stomach turn, it was that one. \u201cGreat to see you, Sal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou too, dear boy. We were just talking about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood things?\u201d Carmine asked.</p><p>\u201cYour father was telling me what you\u2019ve been up to.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cSo not good things, then.\u201d</p><p>Vincent stood, shaking his head as the others laughed. \u201cIf you\u2019ll excuse us, I need to speak with my son.\u201d</p><p>Sal waved them away, and the color drained from Carmine\u2019s face at his father\u2019s rattled expression.</p><p>16</p><p>Carmine slumped in the leather chair in his father\u2019s office, trying to act nonchalant while inside anarchy reigned. He drummed his fingers on the arm of the chair as Vincent took a seat at his desk with his laptop. \u201cDo you like the number thirteen, Carmine?\u201d</p><p>Carmine\u2019s brow furrowed at the question. \u201cUh, it\u2019s just a number.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never understood the fascination,\u201d Vincent said, typing away at the keys without looking up. \u201cThere\u2019s even a psychological disorder over the fear of the number, triskaidekaphobia. In southern Italy, tredici\u2014the number thirteen\u2014is slang meaning someone\u2019s luck has turned bad.\u201d</p><p>He stopped speaking, and the room grew silent. Carmine drummed his fingers some more. \u201cI appreciate the random trivia, and I\u2019m sure if I ever go on Jeopardy! it\u2019ll come in handy, but I don\u2019t understand what the fuck it has to do with me.\u201d</p><p>Vincent\u2019s typing stopped. \u201cLasciare in tredici.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you telling me my luck ran out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot just yours.\u201d Vincent turned back to his laptop. \u201cI need another favor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need someone to keep an eye on the girl.\u201d</p><p>Carmine looked at him incredulously. \u201cYou want me to spy on her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly,\u201d he said. \u201cI need to make sure she stays safe. I caught Squint touching her.\u201d</p><p>Carmine\u2019s rage boiled over. He stood so quickly his chair flew back. \u201cHe touched her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t harm her, although she did burn her hand,\u201d Vincent said casually, ignoring Carmine\u2019s outburst. \u201cI handled it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou handled it?\u201d Carmine clenched his hands into fists as he fought back the urge to pummel something.</p><p>\u201cYes, I handled it,\u201d Vincent said again. \u201cWhat\u2019s gotten into you?\u201d</p><p>Carmine glared at his father as he flopped back down in the chair. \u201cI don\u2019t like that shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but you need to control your temper. I\u2019d get rid of Squint if I could, but Sal\u2019s blinded by the fact that he\u2019s technically family. Sal has no blood relatives left, since his brother\u2019s and sister\u2019s families were all murdered. That\u2019s why he\u2019s always been fixated on you. You are the closest thing to a son he had\u2014his godson. Getting him to believe Squint\u2019s untrustworthy won\u2019t be easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think he could be a danger?\u201d</p><p>Vincent sighed. \u201cTrouble\u2019s brewing, so there\u2019s little focus on things going on within the walls of the fortress, so to speak. I think Squint\u2019s more than happy to take advantage of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019s he interested in Haven, though?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably because it\u2019s wrong for him to be.\u201d</p><p>Carmine\u2019s heartbeat thrashed in his ears. Wrong? \u201cYou mean it\u2019s wrong for someone like her to be with one of you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was referring to him having no right to touch what isn\u2019t his,\u201d Vincent said. \u201cAlthough, that is a good point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you do think that\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it is,\u201d Vincent said. \u201cRape is always wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean consensual.\u201d</p><p>Vincent shook his head. \u201cDo you really think a girl in her position has the right frame of mind to consent? It would take a strong woman to look at him as a man and not a master, to see him for who he is and not what he is. But just because it could happen, doesn\u2019t mean it should. It\u2019s asking for heartache for everyone involved.\u201d</p><p>Carmine sat quietly. He\u2019d never given any of that much thought. To him, she was just a girl.</p><p>\u201cRegardless, Squint\u2019s advances were unwanted,\u201d Vincent said. \u201cI should\u2019ve figured this would happen, but I couldn\u2019t have done anything differently. I couldn\u2019t have kept her hidden. Sal would\u2019ve asked about her because of who she is.\u201d</p><p>Carmine\u2019s brow furrowed. \u201cWho is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs her father important or something? Michael Antonelli?\u201d</p><p>Vincent gaped at him. \u201cI don\u2019t recall telling you Michael was her father.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cHaven may have mentioned it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised,\u201d he said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t claim her, so not many people know that information. His own wife only just recently found out. She wasn\u2019t very happy.\u201d</p><p>Carmine laughed dryly. \u201cHaven mentioned that, too.\u201d</p><p>Vincent raised his eyebrows. \u201cHave you told her you know them?\u201d</p><p>Carmine stared at his father. \u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do,\u201d Vincent insisted. \u201cOr, well, you know Katrina\u2019s brother. We\u2019re related to him.\u201d</p><p>Silence permeated the office. It took a minute for that to click with Carmine. \u201cKatrina Moretti? Are you telling me the bitch who tortured Haven is Corrado\u2019s sister?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat motherfucker! Does he know what they were doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPossibly, but none of that matters right now,\u201d Vincent said. \u201cSquint has his eyes set on the girl, so she needs to be watched for that reason.\u201d</p><p>It didn\u2019t make sense to Carmine, but he knew his father wasn\u2019t going to tell him anything more.</p> <p>\u201cJust relax,\u201d Carmine said softly, pulling out a chair for Haven as they made their way to the table for dinner that night. He took the seat beside her, and Haven remained still as they bowed their heads for a prayer. They helped themselves to food but Haven only took a little, too anxious to eat. She scooted the food around on her plate with her fork, alarmed, as she tried to ignore Nunzio\u2019s gawking from across the table.</p><p>\u201cSo, Carmine,\u201d Salvatore said, attempting conversation. \u201cYou\u2019ll be eighteen in a few months. Any plans for the future?\u201d</p><p>Haven peered at him, curious. She, too, wondered what his plans were, but Carmine merely shrugged, offering no answer.</p><p>Dr. DeMarco cleared his throat. \u201cCarmine can do what he wants with his life, but I like to think he\u2019ll hang around here until he graduates.\u201d</p><p>Nunzio laughed mockingly. \u201cSchool\u2019s useless. What\u2019s a diploma gonna get you these days\u2014a job at McDonald\u2019s? There\u2019s money to be made out there, and no piece of paper from some school will matter a bit when it comes to it.\u201d</p> <p>Dr. DeMarco spoke up again, his voice sharp. \u201cA diploma may not matter in our line of work, but it\u2019s not about a piece of paper. It\u2019s about finishing what you started, being dedicated and not selling out. Nothing is worse than an opportunist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t call it being an opportunist,\u201d Nunzio said. \u201cIt\u2019s wising up and changing priorities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour priorities shouldn\u2019t change when you\u2019re on a path you swore you\u2019d stay on,\u201d Vincent said. \u201cCarmine\u2019s mother would want him to see it through.\u201d</p><p>Nunzio shrugged. \u201cBut Maura\u2019s not here anymore, so why does it matter what she\u2019d want?\u201d</p><p>Dr. DeMarco jumped to his feet, his chair crashing to the floor. \u201cDon\u2019t even say her name, scarafaggio! You never disregard your family!\u201d</p><p>Haven tensed, her heart feverishly pounding and making her dizzy. Salvatore grabbed Dr. DeMarco\u2019s arm and forced him to sit down. They went back to eating without another word, strained silence overtaking the room.</p> <p>\u201cSo, Haven . . .\u201d</p><p>Her name spoken in the high-pitched voice made the fork slip from her fingers. It clanged against her plate, and she winced at the sound. Taking a deep breath, she glanced at Salvatore. She wanted nothing more than to blend into the background, wishing she could be overlooked.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be nervous,\u201d Salvatore said. \u201cI\u2019m just curious how you\u2019re finding life with Vincent. As hidden away as you were, I wondered if you were a figment of the imagination.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe DeMarcos are kind to me, sir,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cThey treat me fairly.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s great to hear. If I had known the Antonellis acted so cruelly, I would\u2019ve stepped in. By the time Vincent informed me, it was too complicated to intervene.\u201d</p><p>Before Haven had the chance to make sense of what he had said, Carmine interjected. \u201cWhat the fuck are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>Dr. DeMarco groaned. \u201cMind your manners, son.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore shrugged. \u201cPerhaps I\u2019ve said too much. Forget I brought it up.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t say some shit like that and then say, \u2018forget about it,\u2019\u201d Carmine said. \u201cIf you knew one of your own abused a kid, why didn\u2019t you do anything?\u201d</p><p>Salvatore glanced at Dr. DeMarco, who subtly shook his head.</p><p>\u201cMichael Antonelli is hardly one of our own,\u201d Salvatore said, turning back to Carmine. \u201cThere are certain rules that govern this life\u2014rules you can\u2019t disregard because you don\u2019t like something that\u2019s going on. Personal feelings have no place in business.\u201d</p><p>Nunzio let out a bitter laugh from his seat but offered no opinion.</p><p>The strained silence returned as Carmine glared at Salvatore and his father. They seemed oblivious to the looks, both of them instead focusing on Haven.</p><p>She cleared her throat, unable to take it. \u201cThank you for your concern, sir.\u201d</p><p>Under his breath, Carmine mumbled, \u201cDon\u2019t fucking thank him.\u201d</p><p>Haven lay with her head on Carmine\u2019s shoulder later that night as the two of them watched a movie in her bedroom. She ran her fingers down his forearm and stroked the back of his hand before turning it over and tracing the creases of his palm. His fingers twitched as she grazed the tattoo on his wrist. \u201cDo you really believe that? Trust no one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI used to,\u201d he said. \u201cUntil you came along.\u201d</p><p>She picked her head up to look at him. \u201cYou trust me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, why does that surprise you?\u201d he asked. \u201cI let you sleep in my bed and be around my stuff. You think I\u2019d do that if I didn\u2019t trust you? That\u2019s not me at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re finicky.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled, shaking their bodies with the motion. \u201cAm I that bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cYou still won\u2019t let me clean your room, though.\u201d</p><p>He sighed exaggeratedly. \u201cThat has nothing to do with trust or being finicky. I feel like an asshole having you clean up after me. I mean, you\u2019re my girl\u2014you aren\u2019t supposed to do that shit.\u201d</p><p>A swell of hope surged inside her when the words my girl rolled from his lips. \u201cBut don\u2019t you see? That\u2019s one of the only things I can do for you. I have nothing to offer, Carmine. No way to make you happy.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her, his expression intense. Self-conscious, Haven looked away, but Carmine grasped her chin and pulled her gaze back to him. \u201cDon\u2019t feel like you have to do things to impress me. Being yourself is enough to keep me interested.\u201d</p><p>Staring at him, she wondered if it could really be that simple.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re pure,\u201d he said, as if he could sense her reservation. \u201cAfter everything I\u2019ve done, I just hope I can be good enough for you.\u201d</p><p>She blinked a few times, stunned he\u2019d say such a thing. \u201cYou\u2019re too good for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d He scoffed. \u201cAre we talking about the same person? The selfish fucker who curses and yells and beats up people because he can\u2019t control his temper? You know, the one who drinks like a fish and fries his brain with drugs? That person is too good for you?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m talking about the boy who shared his chocolate bar with me when he probably never shared anything before, who gave me his mama\u2019s favorite book because he thought I deserved to read. I\u2019m talking about the boy who treats me like a regular girl, the one who desperately needs his bedroom cleaned and laundry washed but chooses to live in a mess and wear dirty clothes because he\u2019s too polite to ask the girl he kisses for help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Carmine said. \u201cI\u2019d like to meet that motherfucker.\u201d</p><p>Haven smiled as he pulled her toward him again, and she rested her head on his shoulder. Carmine took her hand, running his fingers along it much like she\u2019d done his, being careful to avoid the fresh wound.</p><p>17</p><p>Haven headed out of her bedroom at a quarter after eight in the morning and collided with Dominic outside her door. She recoiled, but he just stood in front of her, holding a DVD and a bowl of popcorn. \u201cAbout time you wake up, Twinkle Toes. Now turn around and head back into the room.\u201d</p><p>Dominic took a step forward, and Haven instinctively took one back. He found it amusing and did it again, continuing until they were both inside the bedroom. He shut the door and put the bowl on the table before turning on the DVD.</p><p>Grabbing the remote, he flopped down on the couch and kicked his feet up on the table. He started the movie, chewing noisily as he munched on the popcorn. \u201cYou just gonna stand there? Your feet might get tired.\u201d</p><p>Haven tentatively sat beside him, her brow furrowing when she realized he\u2019d put on a cartoon. She was about to ask him what they were watching when he thrust the bowl of popcorn into her face.</p><p>She cowered from the sudden movement, and he froze. \u201cScared of popcorn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said as he pushed the bowl closer to her. She took a small handful and turned to the television. \u201cWhat are we watching?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShrek!\u201d He threw a handful of popcorn into his mouth. \u201cI love this shit.\u201d</p><p>She watched for a bit. After getting to know Dominic, she wasn\u2019t surprised he enjoyed such a movie. \u201cIt makes sense we\u2019re watching cartoons. Isn\u2019t that what people do when they babysit?\u201d</p><p>He laughed, startling Haven when he playfully tossed a piece of popcorn at her. \u201cLook at you making a joke! You\u2019re funny. No wonder Carmine fell in love with you.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him. \u201cUh, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d say he was . . . in love.\u201d She whispered the last part, having a hard time getting the words to leave her lips.</p><p>\u201cPlease, girl. He\u2019s given up all of his puttani and that\u2019s something I never thought I\u2019d see. His favorite pastime was always busting a nut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA nut?\u201d</p><p>Dominic ruffled her hair. \u201cOh so innocent. Ask Carmine what a nut is when he gets home. I wanna see him try to explain it to you.\u201d</p><p>After the movie finished, Haven followed Dominic out into the backyard. She sighed as the warm sunshine hit her face. Dampness lingered in the air, a cool breeze wafting across her bare arms and flushed cheeks.</p><p>She paused a few feet from the door. \u201cAre you sure I\u2019m allowed out here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m positive,\u201d he said. \u201cI asked.\u201d</p><p>The two of them strolled toward the thinning trees, the brittle, fallen leaves crunching under her shoes. She was apprehensive when they headed into the forest, the same ones she\u2019d tried to escape through months before, but she wanted to believe he wouldn\u2019t lead her astray.</p><p>The sound of rushing water met her ears as they walked, the two of them coming upon a small creek. She knelt down, dipping her hand into the frigid water. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful out here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess,\u201d Dominic said. \u201cI\u2019m not fond of nature. Carmine\u2019s the one who plays in the woods.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarmine comes out here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe hasn\u2019t since he got back from the boarding school, but he used to when he wanted to be alone. He got into funks, so he\u2019d come down by the water or run along the trail.\u201d</p><p>Dominic sat down and leaned against a barren tree as he gazed at the water. Haven mulled it over before pulling off her shoes and wiggling her toes in the thick grass. Rolling up her pant legs to her knees, she stepped into the freezing water.</p><p>\u201cThere are all kinds of creatures in there,\u201d Dominic warned. \u201cFish. Bugs. Snakes.\u201d</p><p>She smiled as the mud squished between her toes. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of what\u2019s in this water.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI thought all chicks were afraid of snakes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot me.\u201d She laughed. \u201cI grew up with scorpions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you afraid of anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Everyone\u2019s afraid of something.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo what are you afraid of?\u201d</p><p>She paused, considering how to answer. \u201cHope.\u201d</p><p>His brow furrowed. \u201cHope scares you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI try not to hope for anything,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you expect nothing, you aren\u2019t disappointed when you get nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s . . . sad,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have any hope?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI guess I do a little bit now.\u201d She kicked around in the mud, not wanting to dwell on the fact that she now had the one thing she told herself she\u2019d never succumb to. \u201cWhat are you afraid of?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLosing my dad,\u201d he said. \u201cI already lost my mom to this life. I don\u2019t want to lose him, too.\u201d</p><p>An ache strangled her chest as she thought through his words. Her mama was still alive, but she felt as though she\u2019d lost her forever.</p><p>\u201cYou should always have hope, you know,\u201d Dominic said.</p><p>\u201cMy mama used to say that all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmart woman,\u201d he said. \u201cYou knew her?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes. I spent my whole life with her. She told me to run, to try to escape, but I got caught. That\u2019s when your father took me.\u201d</p><p>Dominic stared at her. \u201cMy father took you from your mother? Does he know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he knows.\u201d</p><p>They were quiet for a while, Dominic sitting in thought as she stomped around in the creek. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re here,\u201d he said eventually. \u201cIt stumps me that he\u2019d take you from your mother. That\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was scary to leave her, but I wouldn\u2019t call it wrong,\u201d she said. \u201cCompared to where I came from, my mama would say he did me a favor.\u201d</p><p>Dominic stared at her in silence for a while before telling her they needed to get back. Although she hadn\u2019t wanted to go inside, she tentatively stepped out of the water. Her feet were covered in mud so she cleaned them off, figuring Dr. DeMarco wouldn\u2019t be happy with a dirty-footed servant scampering around when he had company.</p><p>They strolled toward the house in silence, finding a large white box truck now parked in the backyard. The men from last night were unloading boxes, taking them into a door in the side of the house, hidden under vines and green growth, blending into the surroundings.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know a door was there,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cIt leads to the basement,\u201d he said. \u201cTrust me when I say you don\u2019t want to go down there.\u201d</p><p>Nunzio stepped from behind the truck with a box then, his eyes drifting toward her. Haven moved closer to Dominic and focused her eyes on the ground, not wanting to give him the wrong impression.</p><p>Dominic went to take a shower when they made it inside, while Haven gathered Carmine\u2019s laundry, intending to start her daily cleaning. A foot or so from the top of the steps, she froze when she saw someone heading toward her. Fear ripped through her, so powerful she lost her breath.</p><p>Nunzio.</p><p>What she saw in his eyes alarmed her, hatred and lust thrown into a big frenzy of excited emotion. Her heart pounded fiercely, that voice in the back of her head telling her to get away. She took a few steps back and dropped the hamper, the clothes spilling out into the library as she sprinted to her room. She could hear him behind her as she flung the door closed, his foot blocking it before it could latch.</p><p>She backed away, looking around for some protection when he stepped into the room. Nunzio closed the door behind him, and Haven\u2019s knees nearly buckled when the lock clicked into place.</p><p>She was trapped.</p><p>Nunzio calmly pulled off his coat and tossed it on the table, the nonchalance when he spoke making it sound as if they were old friends. \u201cAlone at last.\u201d</p><p>Loosening his tie, he pulled his shirt from his pants and let it hang as he sauntered toward her. Haven let out a scream for help, but Nunzio backhanded her before it could echo from the room. The strike stunned her into silence. \u201cBehave, and I\u2019ll make it worth it for you.\u201d</p><p>Tears flowed from her eyes as she stepped back once more, her legs colliding with the footboard of the bed. \u201cDon\u2019t touch me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, don\u2019t be like that.\u201d He smiled vindictively. \u201cDon\u2019t you like making people happy? That\u2019s all you gotta do. Be a good girl and please me. After all, that\u2019s why you exist. It\u2019s all you\u2019re good for. It\u2019s not like anyone could actually love someone like you.\u201d</p><p>He closed the distance between them as he unbuckled his belt. She fought the urge to heave, her body trembling. Stepping to the side, she tried to dart around him, but he blocked her path.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t bite, or I\u2019ll knock your teeth out,\u201d he said, his voice gritty. Grabbing her head, he tried to force her to her knees as his other hand snaked into his pants. Out of time, panicked, Haven snatched his gun from his waistband. Using every ounce of strength she could muster, she swung and smacked him across the face with the butt of the gun. Nunzio stumbled, stunned, and let go of her.</p><p>It was all Haven needed to slip away.</p><p>Throwing the gun across the room, she sprinted for the door. Nunzio recovered and came after her, yelling. Her hand grasped the knob as she unlocked the door, but he grabbed her before she could open it. She screamed Dominic\u2019s name as he turned them around, pushing her roughly toward the bed. She fell and scurried away as he stalked toward her, the bang of the door being forced open her saving grace. Dominic ran in, a towel around his waist but still dripping water from his shower, and shoved Nunzio out of the way before helping Haven to her feet. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d Haven wiped her tears. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t hurt you, right?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head as Nunzio scoffed. \u201cMe, hurt her? That bitch attacked me!\u201d</p><p>Dominic\u2019s face twisted with rage as he snatched the gun from the floor. \u201cHaven, leave. I need to have a talk with my old friend.\u201d</p><p>Haven ran out and hesitated in the library before darting for Carmine\u2019s room. Locking herself in there, she sat on the edge of the bed and covered her ears to drown out the fighting.</p><p>Carmine knew something had gone terribly wrong when he made it home from school and walked into a house filled with fighting. Curses and insults flew around in multiple languages, the anger and hostility coming from the kitchen palpable. Stunned, Carmine paused in the doorway, seeing his father sewing up a cut on Nunzio\u2019s face. \u201cWhat the fuck happened?\u201d</p><p>Dominic walked up behind Carmine, eyeing him warily. \u201cI should\u2019ve watched Haven better. Nunzio cornered her.\u201d</p><p>Carmine\u2019s stomach dropped as he fought to keep his composure. \u201cWhere is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUp in your room,\u201d Dominic said. \u201cShe said she was okay.\u201d</p><p>Sighing, Carmine glanced back at his father in the kitchen as Nunzio snickered and pulled away. \u201cThat bitch begged for it.\u201d</p><p>Carmine\u2019s control slipped at those words. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>Nunzio glared at him. \u201cI said she wanted me.\u201d</p><p>Carmine leaped right for him, and Vincent blocked the path when Nunzio tried to move. Swinging, Carmine\u2019s fist barely connected with the man\u2019s nose when Sal intervened and dragged him away.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sick!\u201d Carmine yelled as Vincent shoved Nunzio into the counter to continue sewing him up. Sal pulled Carmine into the foyer, not letting go of him until they were near the stairs. \u201cThis isn\u2019t right!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, Principe, but didn\u2019t we have a conversation yesterday about feelings having no place in business? He\u2019ll face the consequences for disrespecting your father, but this isn\u2019t a major violation.\u201d</p><p>Carmine stared at him hard. \u201cSo she\u2019s worth nothing to you people? Is that what you\u2019re telling me? Oh, who gives a fuck if he hurts a girl? She\u2019s no one special, because she wasn\u2019t lucky enough to be born into a powerful family!\u201d</p><p>Sal\u2019s expression twisted with anger, the sight of it silencing Carmine. \u201cThat girl means more than you understand, but things are black and white to la famiglia. You need to learn how to distinguish between what\u2019s personal and what\u2019s business. You need to learn to follow the code of conduct here\u201d\u2014he smacked him in the back of the head\u2014\u201cand quit following this so much.\u201d He punched Carmine in the chest, over his heart. \u201cThe moment you cursed at me yesterday, I knew she\u2019d gotten to you here\u201d\u2014another punch in the chest\u2014\u201cand you\u2019re going to cause problems if you don\u2019t start using this.\u201d</p><p>A final smack to the head sent Carmine over the edge. \u201cQuit hitting me!\u201d</p><p>Sal shook his head. \u201cYou know I think of you as a son. I\u2019ve always treated you like you were my own, and I want what\u2019s best for you. I want you to succeed, to have a good life, the life you\u2019re supposed to have. I\u2019m not telling you not to let the girl in here\u201d\u2014he tapped him lightly on the chest\u2014\u201cbut I am telling you not to let those feelings override everything else. You need balance.\u201d</p><p>Carmine ran his hands down his face, frustrated. \u201cI get it.\u201d</p><p>Sal clapped him on the shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re enamored. These things happen, but it\u2019s a fragile situation that shouldn\u2019t be flaunted. Trust me when I say it\u2019s not the time to ignore reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just . . . I didn\u2019t realize it was obvious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a complicated situation,\u201d Sal said. \u201cYour father has a similar problem. I\u2019ve spent years trying to get him to recognize boundaries, but he still finds himself blurring lines.\u201d A loud bang rang out in the kitchen, and Salvatore sighed. \u201cNow likely being one of those times.\u201d</p><p>Haven stared at the clock, counting the minutes as they passed. Three. Five. Eight. Twelve. Sixteen. Twenty-two.</p><p>After thirty agonizing minutes, frantic footsteps bounded into the library. Someone tried to turn the locked doorknob, but Haven refused to open it, terrified to move. Keys jingled as the door opened, and Carmine rushed into the room.</p><p>He pulled her into his arms, tears still streaming down her cheeks. She wasn\u2019t sure how long he held her before Dr. DeMarco\u2019s voice rang out from the doorway. \u201cIs she okay?\u201d</p><p>Haven\u2019s vision was blurry, but she could make out his stern expression. He looked irate. She hoped that anger wasn\u2019t directed at her.</p><p>\u201cShe will be,\u201d Carmine said. \u201cIs Nunzio gone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSal\u2019s driving him to the airport now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe airport,\u201d Carmine repeated. \u201cHe got off too easy. I would\u2019ve killed him.\u201d</p><p>All was quiet for a bit, and Haven closed her eyes. She began to wonder if they were alone when Dr. DeMarco\u2019s voice rang out once more. \u201cI would\u2019ve killed him, too.\u201d</p><p>Carmine lay beside Haven in bed, brushing the hair from her face. Her cries had quieted, her face blotchy from tears. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said. \u201cI should\u2019ve been here to protect you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault,\u201d she replied, her voice scratchy. \u201cI\u2019m the one who\u2019s sorry for being so weak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t weak,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have every right to be shaken up. Fuck, I\u2019m shaken up. No one touches my girl unless she wants to be touched. That\u2019s something my mom made sure we understood\u2014a woman\u2019s body is a temple, and you should never enter it without an invitation.\u201d</p><p>He paused and ran his fingers through his hair. It was difficult to talk about, but he wanted to share this with her. \u201cI don\u2019t know details, but my mom was raped when she was young. She spent time volunteering as an advocate after that. My father still donates money to the center in Chicago where she worked.\u201d</p><p>Haven scooted closer to him. \u201cWow.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s the reason I don\u2019t want you to feel like we have to do anything. Your body is your temple, and I won\u2019t come in it unless you want me to.\u201d The moment the words left his lips he laughed to himself. \u201cThat sounds so fucking wrong. I didn\u2019t mean it that way.\u201d</p><p>Haven lifted her head to look at him. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong about what you said?\u201d</p><p>Of course she wouldn\u2019t get the perverted connotation. \u201cI don\u2019t think now is the time to explain.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged and laid her head back down.</p><p>The room was quiet except for the air whistling as it blew from the vent in the ceiling. Haven took one of Carmine\u2019s hands and linked their fingers together, resting them at her chest. He felt her breath as her lips brushed across his swelling knuckles.</p> <p>He smiled at the feel of her kiss. \u201cWhat are you thinking, tesoro?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m wondering if, uh . . . It\u2019s stupid.\u201d</p><p>His curiosity grew. \u201cNothing you think is stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, do you think . . .\u201d She paused to take a deep breath. \u201cDo you think you could ever love someone like me?\u201d She whispered the question, and he froze. Before he could gather his thoughts and answer, Haven cut in again. \u201cI told you it was stupid.\u201d</p><p>Devastation shook her voice as she took his hesitation as rejection. She found the nerve to bring up a subject he wasn\u2019t brave enough to broach, to utter the word love that terrified him so much, and instead of reassuring her he clammed up. \u201cHaven, I could never love someone like you, because there isn\u2019t anyone else like you. You\u2019re one of a kind.\u201d</p><p>The haunting melody filtered into Carmine\u2019s subconscious, taunting him, as he watched his mom under the flickering streetlight of the vacant alley. Her words filtered past the gloomy song, her voice soft. \u201cMy sole,\u201d she whispered. Her sun. She called him sole because he shined so brightly.</p> <p>She laughed, drowning out the tortuous notes. It was such a beautiful night that she wanted to walk home, and Carmine trusted her so he didn\u2019t argue. His mom was infallible. He would always believe in her.</p><p>It came out of nowhere, the chaos and mayhem. Images flashed before him, so fast and frenzied he could barely keep up. Tires screeching. The terror on her face. Voices cold, their words brutal.</p><p>\u201cRun, Carmine!\u201d she yelled. \u201cRun, baby, and don\u2019t stop!\u201d</p><p>Her screams were loud in the night, but no one was around to help. Carmine stayed frozen, because he couldn\u2019t leave without her. He didn\u2019t want to go alone. He was her sole, her sun . . . He couldn\u2019t bear to leave her in the dark.</p><p>\u201cIf you love me, Carmine Marcello, you\u2019ll run,\u201d she said as tears spilled from her eyes. He hesitated, terrified, but at the last second he fled.</p><p>\u201cShut her up!\u201d a man yelled. \u201cDo it quick!\u201d</p><p>The petrifying, bone-chilling scream rang through the alley. Carmine\u2019s steps waned, and he turned back around. They were hurting his mom. She needed him.</p><p>The men were shrouded in black, but in the flicker of the streetlight, he saw the flash of a face. It was a blur, a mosaic of scar tissue and hate as the loud bang of the gunshot ricocheted in his mind.</p> <p>Startled, Carmine sat upright and clutched his chest as he tried to get his heart to slow down. Glancing beside him in the dim room, he saw Haven\u2019s eyes were wide-open, her expression layered with concern.</p><p>Falling back onto the bed, he ran his hands down his face. Sweating and shaking, his breathing erratic, he half expected Haven to run when he reached out to her. She didn\u2019t, though. Instead, she allowed him to squeeze her in a hug.</p><p>Tears built up as he cleared his throat. \u201cI was eight, and it was my first piano recital. It was late when it was over, and my mom wanted to walk home. She didn\u2019t want to wait for a car to pick us up. We took a shortcut through an alley, and a car pulled up\u2014a black car with dark windows.\u201d</p><p>He could still see it. Generic, another undistinguishable black sedan, but it stood out to him.</p><p>\u201cI saw it and thought my father sent it for us, because he didn\u2019t like us out without protection. But my mom knew. I don\u2019t know how, but she did. She told me to leave, to go straight home. I didn\u2019t want to, but she said if I loved her I\u2019d run. And I fucking loved her, so I did. I ran.\u201d</p><p>Hot tears burned his cheeks. He didn\u2019t fight them\u2014they\u2019d come whether he wanted them to or not. \u201cI made it to the end of the alley when she screamed, and I turned around in enough time to see him pull the trigger. She dropped as the second guy pointed a gun at me. The burning tore through me. At first, I seriously thought I was on fire. I hid behind a Dumpster at a pizzeria around the corner, too scared to go on. I thought they were following me. I thought I was gonna die.\u201d</p><p>He paused to clear his throat, taking a deep breath. \u201cThe next thing I remember is waking up in the hospital. I\u2019d never seen my father cry before that day. He just sat beside my bed, chanting, \u2018It\u2019s my fault,\u2019 and fuck, I felt the same way. I ran. I left her there to die.\u201d</p><p>He let out a shaky breath and squeezed Haven tightly, feeling her warmth and life. Her hand stroked his chest as she looked up at him, her face streaked with tears. \u201cI ran, too, you know. My mama told me to run away and leave her. I only did it because she asked me to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you know the guilt I feel.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cBut you didn\u2019t let her down, Carmine. You did what she needed you to do.\u201d</p><p>Carmine brushed away her tears. \u201cAnd what\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou survived.\u201d</p><p>18</p><p>Time wore on, weeks passing as the chilly southern autumn spawned an unusually frigid winter. The football season ended so Carmine spent more time at home, he and Haven growing closer every day. Despite the coldness outside, despite the dreary weather, warmth and passion flourished inside the old plantation home as young love blossomed, unable to be contained.</p><p>Carmine and Haven would lie together, holding hands and embracing in the darkened bedroom after nightfall, away from prying eyes, away from a reality that couldn\u2019t understand how two kids, broken and yearning, could find a way to somehow feel whole together.</p><p>One night, Carmine brought his lips to her ear. \u201cTi amo tantissimo, mia bella ragazza.\u201d</p><p>Haven didn\u2019t know what he was trying to say, but the sound of it made her heart beat wildly.</p><p>He kissed her as she lay on her back, his body moving with her, lips working frantically. She gripped his shoulders, trying to pull him closer, but he held back. Carmine stared into her eyes, searching for an answer to an unasked question. Haven wanted to know what he sought, but before she could ask, he seemed to find his answer.</p><p>The corner of his lips turned up, and he kissed her sweetly before whispering into her ear. \u201cLet me make you feel good. Prometto di non danneggiarlo. I\u2019ll only touch.\u201d</p><p>She trembled at his words, her body igniting in a fire she\u2019d never felt before. \u201cI trust you.\u201d</p><p>Carmine reached toward the nightstand and hit his stereo remote, soft classical music instantly filling the room. \u201cTell me to stop any time and I will.\u201d</p><p>She laced her trembling fingers through his thick hair. Carmine\u2019s lips moved down to her neck as he softly stroked her sides before pulling off her shirt. Haven closed her eyes, trying to relax, and shivered when she felt his warm breath against her bare stomach. He tasted her flesh, his tongue dipping inside her belly button, and she gasped as tingles coursed through her lower half.</p><p>Carmine took his time, kissing and caressing every inch of exposed skin. She squirmed, her moans mixing with the song pouring from the speakers. She had no idea what it was, no idea who performed it, but the melodic notes washed through her, accentuating every calculated touch of Carmine\u2019s fingertips. His hands roamed her thighs, stroking her soft skin, before making their way up her torso. He slipped them beneath her, undoing her bra clasp with one swift experienced flick.</p><p>Surprised, Haven opened her eyes again and peeked up at him as he sat back on his knees. He smiled sheepishly as he pulled off her bra, discarding it on the floor. His eyes remained on hers for a moment before slowly, carefully, drifting down.</p><p>She tensed self-consciously as she thought of her scars. He could see every mark and blemish, the remnants of the countless beatings she\u2019d endured at the hands of the first people who were supposed to protect her. She felt so raw and open, having never been so exposed to someone before.</p><p>She waited for him to react, for him to be repulsed and turn away, but instead he trailed his pointer finger down her chest, from the dip in her throat to between her breasts. He traced the small scars with his fingertips, drawing a pattern on her quivering stomach. \u201cBellisima,\u201d he whispered. \u201cYou\u2019re so fucking beautiful.\u201d</p><p>The sound of his voice put her at ease. Sparks danced across her chest, her skin pebbling under his touch. The hand resting on her stomach drifted farther down, slipping under the waistband of her shorts. Haven could think of nothing and feel nothing but his touch, the sensations overwhelming her from head to toe. It only grew stronger when his hand rubbed the space between her thighs that, until that moment, she hadn\u2019t realized desperately ached for his attention.</p><p>He pressed his lips to hers again as she swallowed a cry and arched her back. Jolts of electricity ran through her veins, tiny pop rock explosions igniting inside her. Her legs shook, her breathing erratic as the softest of whimpers forced their way from her throat.</p><p>Fisting the bedsheets, she squeezed her eyes shut tightly, the sensations more intense than she imagined a simple touch could evoke. Her entire body was on fire, lava pooling beneath the surface and rushing through her bloodstream, warming her skin to a light pink flush.</p><p>Carmine whispered into her neck, his voice gritty. \u201cJust feel it, hummingbird. Enjoy the flutters.\u201d</p><p>The buildup intensified, growing stronger and stronger as Haven moved her hips, seeking more friction. Her body craved it, cried out for it, begging for more.</p><p>Groaning, Carmine pulled his mouth from her neck, his lips meeting hers as her body seized up before erupting in pleasure. Shockwaves went off inside her, shooting down her legs and up through her stomach as she convulsed with her first orgasm. She stammered, trying to call his name, but nothing coherent passed between their connected lips. The feeling faded as quickly as it came, the tension receding from her muscles like a wave. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>19</p><p>Two in the morning and Carmine couldn\u2019t sleep. He slipped downstairs, jumping when his father appeared in the doorway to the kitchen. Carmine hadn\u2019t expected anyone to be up at this hour, much less him. Vincent\u2019s gaze followed Carmine as he brushed past him to get something to drink. \u201cInsomnia?\u201d</p><p>Carmine shrugged. \u201cYou could say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it nightmares again?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou could say that.\u201d Carmine was annoyed he would bring that up, but he could see the genuine concern in his father\u2019s expression. He didn\u2019t want to dwell, though, so he quickly changed the subject. \u201cSo, why are you up?\u201d</p><p>Vincent sighed. \u201cI\u2019m leaving for Chicago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you had to go this weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither did I until Sal called,\u201d he said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t supposed to fly out again until next weekend, but the trouble with the Russians is escalating.\u201d</p><p>Carmine\u2019s brow furrowed. \u201cYou have a problem with Russians?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had one for a while. They impede on our territory, which is something we can\u2019t tolerate.\u201d</p><p>Carmine was surprised he was telling him that much. His father wasn\u2019t one to offer extra information. \u201cWell, good luck with that, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. I\u2019ll be back on Sunday night . . . hopefully.\u201d He hesitated like he had something else to say but eventually shook his head. \u201cHave a good weekend, son.\u201d</p><p>Vincent left the kitchen. Carmine stood there, looking at the spot where his father had been standing. He chugged the last little bit of juice in his glass before heading upstairs, lying silently in bed and staring at the ceiling.</p><p>When Haven woke up the next morning, he wrapped his arms around her waist. \u201cMorning, bella ragazza. How about we get dressed and do something today?\u201d</p><p>She smiled sleepily. \u201cLike what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhatever you want,\u201d he said. \u201cWe could go to the movies or the park, maybe get some dinner.\u201d</p><p>He had no clue what people did. The closest he had ever been to a date before was going through a fast-food drive-through on the way to drop some girl off after sex. He wasn\u2019t sure he could count even that, considering he usually made them buy their own food.</p><p>An odd expression flickered across her face. \u201cIn public?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cYes, in public. With other people around, even.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, okay.\u201d She smiled excitedly. \u201cI\u2019ll get dressed.\u201d</p><p>He let go of her and watched as she scampered away, amazed something as trivial as a movie could make her light up so much.</p><p>Carmine showered and sifted through his clothes, choosing a pair of faded jeans and a green long-sleeved button-up shirt, since green was her favorite color. He rolled up the sleeves, feeling stifled, and pulled on a pair of Nikes before grabbing his things. Heading out, he noticed Haven standing in the doorway of her room, wearing a pair of tight jeans and a blue sweater, fidgeting. \u201cDo I look okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look more than okay,\u201d he said, holding his hand out to her.</p> <p>Leading her downstairs, he helped Haven into the car and fiddled with his seat and mirrors for a few minutes. Haven giggled. \u201cFinicky.\u201d</p><p>He rolled his eyes and started the car, scanning through radio stations as Haven stared out the side window, a small smile playing on her lips. They held hands and chatted about nothing in particular during the drive. She never ceased to amaze him with her knowledge about things she had never experienced.</p><p>He drove straight to his favorite Mexican restaurant and slowed to pull into the parking lot until his gaze fell on a white car. He accelerated again to pass the place, knowing they couldn\u2019t eat there if Lisa was working. He pulled into a steakhouse about a block away and shut off the engine as Haven turned to him. \u201cYou knew someone there, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He sighed and ran his hand through his hair. \u201cYeah. I don\u2019t want you to think it\u2019s because I don\u2019t wanna be seen with you, because I do. It\u2019s just, it\u2019s Lisa, and she\u2014\u201d</p><p>Haven placed her pointer finger against his lips. \u201cI understand.\u201d</p><p>They were quickly seated in the restaurant, and Haven picked up the laminated menu, her brow furrowing and lips moving as she sounded out the words. When the waitress came to take their orders, Haven looked at Carmine, expecting him to speak for her, but he just sat patiently.</p><p>She got the hint. \u201cI\u2019ll have the stuffed chicken breast with a side salad, please.\u201d</p><p>Carmine smirked. \u201cA twelve-ounce New York strip steak for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you want it?\u201d the waitress asked.</p><p>\u201cRare,\u201d he said. \u201cBarely cooked.\u201d</p><p>Haven gazed at him peculiarly when the waitress walked away. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you like it that way. I always cook your meat well done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, two things in life I prefer bloody\u2014my steak and my enemies.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cYou\u2019re too young to have enemies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish,\u201d he muttered. \u201cI was born with enemies. My last name alone gives me more than I could ever earn.\u201d</p><p>It only took a few minutes for their food to be brought out. Carmine expected things to be edgy since she wasn\u2019t often around people, but she surprised him again. He wondered if there would ever be a time when she didn\u2019t.</p><p>He paid the bill before they headed across town to the movie theater. The two of them stood on the outskirts of the waiting crowd, and Carmine took Haven\u2019s hand as he scanned the list of movies. \u201cWhat are you in the mood for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really know much about any of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, there\u2019s one about a drugged-up rock star, one about a family with a whole bunch of kids, and one about some kids who get sucked into a game.\u201d She looked at him with confusion on the last one, and he chuckled. \u201cDon\u2019t ask. There\u2019s also some chick flick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChick flick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you know, the lovey-dovey romantic sharing bullshit.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cAny of them are fine by me.\u201d</p><p>He led her up to the window and bought two tickets. At the concession stand, he bought a soda and a box of Sour Patch Kids before leading Haven into the packed theater. She hesitated, glancing around, and it dawned on him that this was her first time. It was easy for him to forget sometimes that she was still new to the world and hadn\u2019t experienced the things he took for granted. He squeezed her hand, trying to be reassuring, and chose a seat near the exit in case she felt the need to escape.</p><p>She relaxed as he pushed the armrest out of the way and pulled her close to him. The theater finished filling as it significantly darkened. Haven tensed at the thunderous noise coming from the speakers but relaxed again by the time the movie started. He popped a few Sour Patch Kids into his mouth, and Haven eyed the candy before pulling out a piece. Her face contorted as soon as it hit her tongue, and he chuckled. \u201cIt\u2019s sour, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but it\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>She took a couple more and watched the movie intently while Carmine spent most of the time focusing on her. They shared the soda and munched on the candy like it was no big deal, but to both of them, it was. Carmine was giving, and Haven had no qualms taking from him.</p><p>He felt no anger as she snatched a piece of candy right from his hand, only pride that she had grown so brave. Her guard was down, and little by little, Carmine felt himself cracking too.</p><p>He took her hand when the credits rolled, and the two of them slipped out of the theater before everyone else. Haven enthusiastically chatted the entire way home. He had no clue what she was talking about, but he smiled anyway, her happiness making him content.</p><p>Nine men. Nine guns. Almost ninety bullets. One delivery truck full of electronics.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t how Vincent had expected to spend his Saturday night.</p><p>They were outnumbered two to one. A run-of-the-mill Glock was pointed at Vincent\u2019s chest while he stared down the barrel of a Beretta. The hand of the man holding the Glock shook, telling Vincent he was nervous. For that reason, Vincent chose to aim his revolver at the other one. If Vincent had learned anything, it was that a man with a steady hand wouldn\u2019t hesitate to pull a trigger.</p><p>Corrado stood a few feet away, in the midst of a showdown with Ivan Volkov. The two men glared, neither one moving or speaking, with their guns pointed at each other\u2019s heads. Corrado seemed unaware of everyone else around them. Vincent wasn\u2019t sure if that was good or bad.</p><p>Giovanni held his ground despite the armed men zeroing in on him. The box truck idled, the cramped alley filling with the thick, suffocating fumes. It burned Vincent\u2019s nose and distorted his vision, but he fought to keep his focus. They had been called out by Sal a few minutes earlier, saying a truck Giovanni\u2019s crew had hijacked on the east side of the city was stolen from them by thugs. They had tracked it down, expecting to find amateurs, but came head-to-head with the Russians again.</p><p>The man with the Glock was the first to crack. He lowered his weapon and frantically took a step back. Shaking his head, he wordlessly ran out of the alley.</p><p>One by one they surrendered, their lack of loyalty astounding. They fled, leaving the three of them with an unruffled Volkov. There was no fear in his expression, no concern in his eyes, no surprise that his men had abandoned their posts.</p><p>They were nothing like the Italians. If one of them abandoned la famiglia, they wouldn\u2019t live to see another sunrise.</p><p>After a moment, Volkov lowered his gun and slipped it into his coat. \u201cYou may have the truck,\u201d he said, as though he was simply being gracious under the circumstances.</p><p>He tried to walk away, but Corrado stepped in his path. \u201cNext time I see you, I\u2019m going to kill you.\u201d</p><p>Volkov paused. \u201cIs that a threat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s a guarantee.\u201d</p><p>A tense second passed, then another, and another. Finally, Volkov\u2019s stone-cold face flickered with the hint of a smile. \u201cI look forward to our next meeting, Moretti.\u201d</p><p>Haven sat cross-legged on Carmine\u2019s bed, The Secret Garden open in her lap. Carmine strolled through his room and kicked a schoolbook lying on the floor, stubbing his toe. He yelped as he grabbed his foot and plopped down on the bed beside her, the jarring losing her place. Before she could find it again, the book closed as Carmine pulled it from her hands. For a second, irritation flared inside her at the interruption, but it faded when he laid his head in her lap.</p><p>She ran her hand across his cheek, gazing down at him with a smile as he spoke. \u201cMy bedroom needs cleaned.\u201d</p><p>She jolted them both with her laughter. \u201cYes, it does.\u201d</p><p>Haven ran her fingers through his hair, and he sighed contently. \u201cTomorrow. Cleaning can wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI look forward to it.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cYou should be terrified.\u201d</p><p>The two of them drifted into a light sleep, but when Haven awoke later, she was alone. She slipped out of the bedroom, surprised to find the library empty, and made her way downstairs to search for Carmine.</p><p>The house was eerily silent, but on the first floor she heard the faint sound of music, the haunting dark melody laced with sadness. She walked slowly toward the family room, spotting Carmine sitting at the piano. His posture matched the song, his body collapsing in on itself, and the music grew louder as he furiously pressed the keys. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Haven sat down in the doorway and leaned against the wall in the shadows, watching him play in a trance. She was mesmerized hearing so much emotion pouring from his fingertips. It was the same tune in a continuous loop\u2014as soon as it would wind down, he\u2019d start it up again.</p><p>She recognized it. Though different in tone, the notes louder and fluid on the piano, it was the same one he strummed on his guitar at night.</p><p>Her eyelids grew heavy as she listened, but she fought sleep, captivated by the music. She eventually lost the battle, and the next thing she knew she was being jolted around. Her eyes snapped open, startled when her gaze fell on Carmine. They were on the second floor, and she was cradled in his arms. She gave him an apologetic look, hoping he wasn\u2019t upset she\u2019d spied on him, but he merely smiled. \u201cWe have beds, tesoro. You don\u2019t have to sleep on the floor.\u201d</p><p>20</p> <p>Haven stood in the doorway of Carmine\u2019s bedroom, exhausted from broken sleep and wanting nothing more than to take a nap, but much more pressing things needed to be dealt with.</p><p>Scanning the mess, Haven contemplated where to start.</p><p>\u201cLook, I have no idea what you\u2019ll find,\u201d Carmine said. \u201cI\u2019m gonna apologize in advance for it all, so I don\u2019t have to keep saying it as we go.\u201d</p><p>He walked over to his dirty clothes and tossed them in his hamper as Haven tentatively navigated her way through the room. \u201cDon\u2019t you want to separate them?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He froze, holding a pair of pants. \u201cSeparate them how?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA pile of whites and a pile of colors will work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d He mock-saluted her. Her smile disintegrated, and he sighed at her fallen expression. \u201cI\u2019m kidding. I can handle separating clothes . . . just forgot I was supposed to.\u201d</p><p>He dug the clothes back out of the hamper and made two piles as Haven picked up his schoolbooks. She set them on his desk and shifted the stacks of paper around to organize a bit.</p><p>\u201cSo, uh . . .\u201d Carmine held up a white shirt with navy blue stripes. \u201cWould you consider this a color or a white?\u201d</p><p>\u201cColor,\u201d she said, looking at the piles. \u201cThat white shirt with the green design is a color too.\u201d</p><p>Carmine picked up the shirt and tossed it on the other pile. \u201cHow can you tell?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe tag says not to use any bleach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou read my tags?\u201d His voice was serious, like they were discussing something scandalous.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cYes, I read them when I do your laundry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you remember that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you didn\u2019t tell me to read the tags.\u201d</p><p>Haven held back her laughter, knowing it would only make his irritation worse. When Carmine finished separating the clothes, she took the hamper of whites downstairs to start a load. She pulled out a few things that were obviously not bleachable and set them aside to wash with the next load, not wanting to make it a big deal.</p><p>She dragged the empty hamper up to Carmine\u2019s room and found him sprawled out on his stomach on the bed. She stared at his back, mesmerized by his sculpted muscles and the way his tattoos stood out prominently on his skin. He shifted around to look at her and smiled lazily. \u201cI forfeit. This shit\u2019s hard.\u201d</p> <p>All he\u2019d done was sort clothes, and he\u2019d done a pretty bad job of it, at that. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to me.\u201d</p><p>He rolled his eyes as she gathered the second load of laundry.</p><p>He put a few CDs away as she stripped his bed.</p><p>He took a break. She fetched fresh linens.</p><p>He put on some music. She made his bed.</p><p>He plopped down at his desk as she walked around the room, grabbing random things and putting them where she assumed they went. Carmine watched her closely, the attention making her hyperaware of every movement. She didn\u2019t mind that he wasn\u2019t much help, considering she\u2019d do a better job on her own, but his gaze made her nervous. Occasionally, he\u2019d grind his teeth, trying to contain his irritation when she touched certain things.</p><p>The floor was cleared before long, all except for the edge of a book sticking out from under his bed. She got on her knees, surprised by how cluttered it was under there. She pulled out books and magazines, as well as some movies. A few shoeboxes were stored under there, but she didn\u2019t touch them. She put the comforter back down and glanced at her pile, gasping when she saw the naked woman on the front of one of the DVD cases. She covered it up, but she wasn\u2019t quick enough\u2014Carmine had already spotted it.</p><p>\u201cKnew you\u2019d find the porn.\u201d He laughed, grabbing it. \u201cWanna watch it?\u201d</p><p>There was a mischievous twinkle in his eyes. She vehemently shook her head, and he tossed the DVD into a drawer in his desk as she picked up a packet of pictures. Carmine pointed toward a drawer to show her where they went. \u201cYou can look at them if you want. I\u2019m pretty sure everyone has clothes on, but no promises.\u201d</p><p>He winked playfully as she pulled out the pictures. She flipped through them and smiled at the familiar faces, surprised to see Nicholas in a few of them. They all looked young and happy, but in most of them something was off about Carmine. His eyes were dull, the spark she was used to missing. He\u2019d clearly been broken back then, the pictures telling a story no words could do justice.</p><p>She opened the drawer he had said they went in and froze. Sitting on top of everything was a tiny doll made out of tan string, no more than a few inches tall. It had short hair made from yarn, felt clothes glued to the body of what was clearly a little boy. She wondered why Carmine would have such a thing as she picked up the tiny doll, careful not to harm it.</p><p>Her chest ached as she gazed at it, remembering a time long ago when she had seen a similar one. She had been young, five or six years old, as she ran through the yard of the Antonelli ranch. Her bare feet kicked up dust as her laughter rang out, loud and blissful like the faint church bells they could hear on Sunday mornings. The tiny doll was clutched tightly in her hand, the long brown yarn flowing in the wind as Haven raced to the stables.</p><p>\u201cMama!\u201d she yelled. \u201cLook, Mama!\u201d</p><p>Her mama sighed as she turned around, her face soaked with sweat. \u201cI\u2019m busy, Haven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, Mama,\u201d she said again, stopping outside the stall her mama stood in with the horse. Haven held up the doll, laughing wholeheartedly. She had never felt so overjoyed in her life. \u201cIt\u2019s me!\u201d</p><p>Her mama\u2019s eyes widened with panic at the sight of the toy. \u201cWhere did you get that? You have to give it back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Mama.\u201d</p><p>Her mama stepped out of the stall and tried to take the doll. \u201cGive it to me. You know better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaven Isadora, give it to me right now!\u201d</p><p>She held it behind her, shaking her head wildly. She wasn\u2019t overjoyed anymore. Now she was heated. She had never had a toy before, and no one was taking this one from her\u2014not even her mama. \u201cNo, it\u2019s mine! Mine! She gave it to me! Not you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho gave it to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy angel, Mama. She gave me a present!\u201d</p><p>Her angel. Haven had dreamed of her for years, the beautiful woman in white that glowed under the hot desert sun. She strained to conjure up the image of her again when a throat cleared nearby, ripping Haven from her thoughts. She glanced up, seeing Carmine right beside her.</p><p>She set the doll down and shut the drawer. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I shouldn\u2019t have touched your stuff.\u201d</p><p>He was quiet as her nervousness grew. She chewed on her bottom lip, afraid of his reaction. His hand shot out toward her abruptly. She flinched, but he merely brushed his fingertips across her mouth, pulling her lip from between her teeth.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna make yourself bleed if you keep that shit up,\u201d he said as he reopened the drawer. \u201cMy mom used to make these dolls for the kids who came to the center she worked at. Most of them moved around a lot, so they didn\u2019t have a lot. She said the dolls were easy to keep up with since they\u2019re small.\u201d</p><p>Easy to hide, too. Haven had kept the doll concealed for years without her master knowing.</p><p>\u201cShe always thought personal was best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s right,\u201d Haven said. \u201cIt is.\u201d</p><p>He sighed, gazing at the little doll. \u201cA few months ago, I would\u2019ve disagreed with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now?\u201d</p><p>He closed the drawer again. \u201cEverything\u2019s different now.\u201d</p><p>21</p><p>Haven lay across her bed, clutching a pencil as she sketched on the top paper of a pile in front of her. She paused, surveying the gray lines, before balling it up and tossing it on the floor.</p><p>She had been at it for hours, the floor littered with balls of white paper. She felt guilty for wasting so much. Paper was made out of wood, and although there wasn\u2019t a lack of trees in Durante, they weren\u2019t to be taken for granted. Trees lived and breathed, enduring so much and still surviving, growing stronger and bigger no matter the conditions.</p><p>Was it silly to think so highly of nature?</p><p>She put the pencil aside and gathered up the crumpled pieces of paper, tossing them into the trash can before heading downstairs. It was a Friday in the middle of December, Carmine\u2019s last day of school before winter break. Christmas was fast approaching, and all Haven could think about was her mama in Blackburn. She remembered the look in her eyes as she would sit in the stables and gaze at the ranch decorated in lights, wishing she were a part of something bigger. She would never admit it, but at Christmas, her mama didn\u2019t want to be on the outside looking in.</p><p>Haven knew the feeling well, and now she was torn\u2014sad for not being with her mama but excited about finally being a part of it all.</p><p>The DeMarcos didn\u2019t decorate much, except for a flimsy fake tree put together out of a box, but Haven helped Carmine string on the lights. A few colored ornaments had been added in the days that followed, and Tess hung mistletoe in the doorway.</p><p>Dr. DeMarco\u2019s presence had been scarce during the past weeks. Most nights he didn\u2019t come home until after the sun had risen and only stuck around long enough to shower and change clothes. Haven didn\u2019t ask any questions, but she found it odd he left her on her own so much.</p><p>Did he finally believe she wouldn\u2019t try to run again?</p><p>She still cooked every night, even though Dr. DeMarco usually wasn\u2019t around for it, and she started eating at the table with the family. The nights Dr. DeMarco came home he never acknowledged her. She would occasionally catch him giving her uncomfortable looks, like he was preparing for something to happen that never did.</p><p>Haven had grabbed a soda from the kitchen and taken a sip when a car pulled up outside. The familiar Mercedes parked near the porch, and Dr. DeMarco headed straight into the house. His voice filtered inside as he stepped into the foyer, his phone to his ear. He shrugged off his coat, and his eyes fell upon her. His gaze lingered there as he ended the call.</p><p>\u201cCan you go to my office? I\u2019ll be up in a moment.\u201d</p><p>He posed it as a question, but it wasn\u2019t negotiable. She nervously made her way to his office and sat in the chair across from his desk. The room was silent, except for the ticking clock on the wall behind her, and it seemed like forever before she heard his footsteps on the stairs. Her heart beat erratically as he neared, and she held her breath instinctively when Dr. DeMarco stepped inside. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He stopped in front of her, holding a large cotton swab and a plastic container. His knees cracked loudly as he crouched down in front of her, the harsh sound making her wince.</p><p>She watched him warily as he smiled, something off about his expression. There was a hint of worry, maybe even a bit of aggravation, but it was mostly sadness, which surprised her. She stared at him, wondering what made him that way, but she couldn\u2019t ask. It wasn\u2019t her place.</p><p>\u201cOpen your mouth,\u201d he ordered.</p><p>She obliged, and he ran the cotton swab along the inside of her cheek. He stood when he finished, placing the swab into the container as he leaned against his desk. \u201cYou don\u2019t look\u2014\u201d</p> <p>His words cut off abruptly when his phone rang. Dr. DeMarco closed his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re excused, child.\u201d</p><p>Haven went straight for the family room, sitting on the couch and longingly gazing at the flimsy tree. The boys arrived home from school, their animated voices ringing through the house. Her eyes fell upon Carmine, and he winked as he sat in a chair across the room. Dominic grinned and plopped down beside her, so close he practically landed in her lap. He flung his arm over her shoulder. \u201cWhat\u2019s up, Twinkle Toes? Did you miss me while I was at school?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, yes,\u201d she said. \u201cI guess.\u201d</p><p>Carmine shot him an annoyed look, and Dominic laughed, pretending to whisper. \u201cI think my brother\u2019s a wee bit jealous.\u201d</p><p>Haven heard footsteps coming downstairs and went to pull away, but Dominic held on to her. Dr. DeMarco walked into the room, his brow furrowing when he looked at them. \u201cDon\u2019t let Tess see you. You\u2019ll start a war, and I\u2019d hate to have to step in.\u201d</p> <p>Dominic laughed. \u201cWhose side would you take?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say anything about taking a side. I have a policy of staying neutral.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, but let\u2019s say you were betting on it,\u201d Dominic said. \u201cWho would you put money on?\u201d</p><p>Dr. DeMarco sighed. \u201cAre you asking who I think would win in a fight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I guess I am.\u201d</p><p>Carmine groaned across the room.</p> <p>\u201cWell, Tess is good at cheap shots, but the child has a knack for survival. She\u2019s not helpless either, as Squint can attest to. Tess is used to having help, while the girl\u2019s used to trudging through it alone. One on one, I have to say she\u2019d take Tess easily.\u201d Haven\u2019s eyes widened, stunned he would say that. \u201cBut don\u2019t tell Tess. She might try to prove me wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t tell Tess that if my life depended on it,\u201d Dominic said. \u201cShe\u2019d kick my ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe could probably take you, too,\u201d Dr. DeMarco said. \u201cI know the child could.\u201d</p><p>Haven\u2019s cheeks reddened as they looked at her. \u201cUh, I don\u2019t know about that, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t underestimate yourself. I certainly don\u2019t.\u201d Haven stared at him, unsure of what he meant, but he looked away without elaborating. \u201cI have stuff to do, so I probably won\u2019t be home until tomorrow. Have a good night.\u201d</p><p>He walked out, an awkward silence lingering in his wake.</p><p>\u201cThat was fucking weird,\u201d Carmine said before turning to his brother. \u201cAnd get your damn arm off my girl before I break it.\u201d</p><p>Dominic leaned in her direction again. \u201cTold you he was jealous.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d Carmine said. \u201cAnd what\u2019s wrong with you? Who would win in a fight? What kinda question is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a good one,\u201d Dominic said. \u201cBut why are you mad? He picked your girl, not mine.\u201d</p><p>They were listening to music later that night when Carmine blurted out something that caught Haven off guard: \u201cWhat do you want for Christmas?\u201d</p><p>What did she want? She had never thought about it. \u201cI don\u2019t expect anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re getting something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I can\u2019t get you a present.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou already gave me my present, Haven. You. Best gift ever.\u201d</p><p>She sighed as he lay down beside her. \u201cI still wish I could buy you something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need anything,\u201d he said, \u201cbut there will be plenty more holidays in the future for you to spoil me rotten.\u201d</p><p>Hope swelled through her. Christmases. Presents. A future. It was all too much to fathom. \u201cDo you guys have big celebrations?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe used to when I was young, but now it\u2019s just us. My aunt Celia always comes for a few days. Other than her and her husband, we don\u2019t have any family. My grandfather\u2019s dead, and we don\u2019t see my grandmother. She has dementia or something. I don\u2019t really know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about your mama\u2019s family?\u201d</p><p>He was quiet. She wondered if she had asked the wrong question, but he finally spoke in a soft voice. \u201cI don\u2019t know of any. She immigrated here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you thought about finding them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cThey never came looking for my mom, never wondered what happened to her, so why should I care about them? Hell, I didn\u2019t know she was born in Ireland until I saw a stack of government papers in my father\u2019s office a few years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it make you sad that you don\u2019t have a big family?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t really think about it. I figure I have enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI used to dream about having a big family,\u201d Haven said. \u201cI used to pretend like I had one. Mama said I was always having conversations with imaginary people. I used to even talk to an angel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike with wings and a halo and shit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat kind of angel, yes, but she didn\u2019t have any of that,\u201d she said. \u201cMama said angels watched over me and someday I\u2019d be one, so I imagined them as people. My angel told me about life. She said I could be free like her when I grew up and have anything I wanted. I guess she didn\u2019t want to crush me with the truth.\u201d</p><p>Carmine pulled her closer to him, burying his face in her hair. Despite it being early, Haven was exhausted. She was on the brink of falling asleep when she heard Carmine\u2019s quiet voice. \u201cYou can have a big family, colibri. She wasn\u2019t lying to you.\u201d</p><p>22</p><p>When he was growing up, Christmas had been Carmine\u2019s favorite time of year. He loved everything about the holiday\u2014watching Rudolph and Frosty and It\u2019s a Wonderful Life, singing Christmas carols and playing Jingle Bells on the piano. Magical was the only way Carmine could describe it, but even that word didn\u2019t do the experience justice.</p><p>After his mom died, though, it changed. He lost interest in most things in life, but especially holidays. Christmas reminded him of her, and all he felt after she was gone was grief.</p><p>It was now Christmas Eve, and for the past week Carmine had watched Haven get into the holiday spirit. He hadn\u2019t seen such enthusiasm for it since his mom\u2019s last Christmas. A part of him still wanted to forget it all, push it aside and go back into his hole, but a bigger part of him couldn\u2019t help but be happy. He had finally found his light in the darkness, the spark that snuffed when his mom died reignited in Haven.</p><p>But Carmine feared the light would go out on him again.</p><p>Carmine\u2019s nerves were on edge as he drummed his fingers on the arm of the couch, steadily watching the clock, hardly able to pay attention to the television. After about twenty minutes, a car pulled up out front, and from the corner of his eye, he could see Haven go rigid. The front door opened and Vincent\u2019s voice ricocheted through the house, followed by soft feminine laughter.</p><p>Aunt Celia.</p><p>Dominic jumped up, picking Celia off the ground to swing her around. She glanced at Carmine once Dominic set her back on her feet. \u201cYou look more like her every time I see you, kiddo.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t have to specify\u2014Carmine knew what she meant. He hugged her, not bothering to respond. It was the truth, and Celia was the only person not afraid to talk to him about his mom.</p><p>Celia pulled back. \u201cHave you been good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t blown anything up lately, if that counts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a start.\u201d</p><p>Vincent cleared his throat, his eyes focused on Haven standing in front of the couch. She stared at the floor as she picked at her fingernails. Seeing her look so frightened tugged at Carmine\u2019s heart.</p><p>Celia approached her. \u201cHaven?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard a lot about you,\u201d Celia said. \u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to meet you.\u201d</p><p>Haven\u2019s voice was barely audible. \u201cYou too, Mrs. Moretti.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall me Celia, dear. Mrs. Moretti is my mother-in-law and quite the wicked witch, at that.\u201d</p><p>Haven\u2019s eyes widened as Vincent laughed, but he shook his head, not interested in sharing whatever he found funny. He shared a knowing look with Celia, the corner of his lips still fighting to turn up.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, I\u2019m hungry and exhausted from traveling,\u201d Celia said, \u201cso don\u2019t expect me to be good company tonight.\u201d</p><p>Haven\u2019s eyes darted to the clock. \u201cI should make dinner.\u201d</p><p>She started out of the room, but Vincent stepped in front of her. A look of fright flashed across her face as she gasped, and he held his hands up when she recoiled.</p><p>It was a train wreck. As much as Carmine hated it, he couldn\u2019t do anything but watch it unfold.</p><p>\u201cRelax, child,\u201d Vincent said. \u201cI was going to tell you not to worry about cooking.\u201d</p><p>Haven wrapped her arms around her chest. \u201cMay I be excused then, mas\u2014uh, sir?\u201d</p><p>Carmine cringed at the exchange.</p><p>\u201cYes, you\u2019re excused.\u201d Haven bolted out of the room before the words were completely out of his mouth, and he shook his head. \u201cI should\u2019ve figured.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t have known,\u201d Celia said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t cross my mind.\u201d</p><p>Carmine watched them suspiciously. \u201cCouldn\u2019t have known what?\u201d</p><p>A small surge of panic coursed through Carmine when his aunt let out a surprised laugh. She could read him easily, and he hadn\u2019t considered that beforehand.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Vincent said, turning away. \u201cWe\u2019ll deal with the girl later.\u201d</p><p>Carmine didn\u2019t see Haven again that night. He hung out in the library in hopes she would surface, but dawn broke with no sign of her. Giving up, he went downstairs and sat at the piano, ghosting his fingers over the keys in the darkness before hitting the opening notes of Moonlight Sonata. He played for a few minutes, the mellow tones swallowing him whole, until a floorboard creaked behind him.</p><p>Cutting off midnote, he swung around to see Haven. Her wild hair hung loose, framing an exhausted and solemn face. He patted the piano bench, inviting her to join him, and she sat down.</p><p>\u201cYou really play beautifully.\u201d She gazed at the keys as he played again, picking up on the same note he\u2019d stopped. \u201cIs that the only song you know?\u201d</p><p>He rounded out Moonlight Sonata. \u201cI know a few more. Not as well as I know that one, but I can play a bit of the others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre they all sad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCan you play something happy for me?\u201d</p><p>A sudden rush of irritation struck him at her request, but he fought it back, knowing he needed to control his temper with her. He roughly played \u201cJingle Bells,\u201d only vaguely remembering the right keys. Entranced, Haven\u2019s eyes sparkled as she watched his fingers.</p><p>The room fell silent when he finished the song. \u201cMerry Christmas, bella ragazza.\u201d</p><p>She smiled, whispering, \u201cMerry Christmas,\u201d back to him. He stared into her eyes and leaned forward to kiss her when a throat dramatically cleared behind them. He pulled back swiftly. Damn near busted.</p> <p>\u201cAm I interrupting?\u201d Celia asked, the smile on her lips telling Carmine she knew she was. He started to speak, but Haven ran from the room before he could say anything. He sighed as she disappeared, and Celia sat down beside him on the bench. \u201cSo talented.\u201d</p><p>He rolled his eyes. \u201cI butchered that song. I haven\u2019t tried to play it in years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaven thought you played it great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because she\u2019s never heard it before. She thought my fuck-ups were intentional.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being self-deprecating. Your mother was always proud of her little Mozart.\u201d</p> <p>He didn\u2019t respond. She knew he wouldn\u2019t, though. He never did.</p><p>\u201cShe recognizes me,\u201d Celia said. \u201cThat\u2019s what your father and I were talking about. She saw me when I visited Blackburn.\u201d</p><p>Carmine sat still as that sank in. \u201cDid you ever think about helping her when you were there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelieve me, kiddo. I wanted to. I talked to Corrado about it, but it was out of my hands. It\u2019s their business and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, yeah.\u201d He cut her off. \u201cKeep business and personal separate, the code of conduct, and all that bullshit. I\u2019ve heard it all before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see you\u2019ve been talking to Salvatore,\u201d she said. \u201cAnyway, if you\u2019ll excuse me, there\u2019s a girl hiding somewhere I should have a talk with.\u201d</p> <p>23</p><p>Haven sat on the edge of her bed, feeling out of place. She\u2019d never spoken to Celia before last night, had merely seen her in passing, but her presence made those two worlds converge. Her old life, the one of pain, was mixing with her new life, where she\u2019d finally started to feel comfortable.</p><p>It made her uneasy. She wanted that feeling to go away.</p><p>There was a light tap on her door. Her stomach felt queasy as she gripped the knob with a sweaty palm. Opening it slowly, she was alarmed to see Celia. \u201cCan I speak to you?\u201d</p><p>Haven nodded. Celia took a seat on the bed, and Haven tried to stop her hands from shaking as she sat beside her. \u201cI wanted to tell you a story. Would you be opposed to that?\u201d</p><p>A story? \u201cNo, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack in the seventies, when I was around eleven, an underground war ignited between, uh, groups. Safe houses were set up around the country for men to get their families out of the line of fire. This place was one of them\u2014it was where my father sent us. It also happens to be where we met my husband, Corrado, and his sister, Katrina. Our fathers were friends. Vincent and I never liked Katrina. She\u2019s an evil twit who gets pleasure from hurting people. I\u2019m sure you know that.\u201d</p><p>Haven nodded. It was true.</p> <p>\u201cCorrado was the opposite of his sister. He stayed out of the way and kept to himself. One day we were all out by the creek, and Katrina was throwing rocks at me. Corrado just stood there and watched. We thought he was a pushover. Vincent wouldn\u2019t stand for it, though, and threw a rock back at her. Smacked her in the face and left a big welt.\u201d</p><p>Despite herself, Haven smiled.</p><p>\u201cKatrina tattled and my mother was about to whip Vincent when Corrado spoke up out of nowhere. This little boy hadn\u2019t said a word for days, and the first time he opened his mouth, he spoke with such authority. He said, \u2018You shouldn\u2019t hit him.\u2019 He said a person shouldn\u2019t be punished for protecting their family. My mother was so surprised that she let Vincent go.\u201d</p><p>Celia laughed to herself. \u201cThat\u2019s my husband. When he speaks, people listen.\u201d She paused. \u201cYou\u2019re probably wondering where I\u2019m going with this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just want you to know I\u2019m not like the people in Blackburn . . . my husband isn\u2019t like them. We too deal with people we don\u2019t want to. It\u2019s something you understand when you involve yourself with a man in this life. They do horrible things\u2014things most women would be ashamed of their husbands doing\u2014but we know it\u2019s ingrained in them, just as things are ingrained in us. I\u2019ve accepted Corrado for who he is, as I\u2019m sure you accept Carmine, bad attitude and all.\u201d</p><p>Haven was alarmed at the mention of Carmine and tried to keep her expression blank. \u201cI accept both of the DeMarco boys.\u201d</p><p>Celia smiled. \u201cI\u2019m sure you do, Haven. I don\u2019t worry about Dominic. Despite everything, he\u2019s pretty well adjusted, but Carmine\u2019s unique. He has a gentle soul underneath that ugly armor he wears, and it\u2019s nice that someone finally cracked through it.\u201d</p><p>Her heart pounded frantically. \u201cHe\u2019s . . .\u201d She didn\u2019t know what to say. \u201c. . . different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, he is,\u201d she said. \u201cAlthough I think what you mean by that isn\u2019t the same as what I mean. But anyway, I should start dinner.\u201d</p><p>Haven jumped up, having forgotten about dinner. It was the reason she\u2019d gone downstairs so early in the first place. \u201cOh no, I should\u2019ve already done it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelax. Christmas dinner\u2019s my gig. I look forward to it every year. Your job\u2019s to enjoy yourself today.\u201d</p><p>After Celia left, Haven headed for the door when Carmine burst into the room, holding a small present. He headed straight for her, no hesitation in his steps. He caught her off guard, and she took a step away, the backs of her knees hitting the bed.</p><p>He stopped in front of her, forcing the gift into her trembling hand. \u201cOpen it.\u201d</p><p>It was hard for her to find a spot to start since he had used so much tape, but she managed to tear a corner. After the paper was off, she stared at the thick blue book with Merriam-Webster\u2019s Dictionary and Thesaurus written on the front. \u201cThis is for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said. \u201cI remember you said you needed a thesaurus. And I know you were joking, but I thought, you know . . . it might be useful or whatever.\u201d He sighed. \u201cI suck at this gift thing.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him as he rambled, realizing he was nervous. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not what I wish I could give you . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s great, Carmine.\u201d</p><p>She walked to the other side of the bed and briefly reconsidered what she was doing, but he\u2019d put himself out there and she wanted to do the same. \u201cI drew something for you.\u201d</p><p>A smile spread over his face. \u201cI thought you forgot our deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never forget things.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled, all trace of nervousness gone, even though hers had skyrocketed. \u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind later when I fuck up.\u201d</p><p>Opening the drawer on the stand, she pulled out a piece of paper and held it so he couldn\u2019t see. \u201cIt\u2019s, uh . . . it\u2019s not that great.\u201d</p><p>He held out his hand. \u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s wonderful.\u201d</p><p>Resigned that it was too late to back out, Haven handed him the drawing. She swallowed a few times, trying to push back her nerves as she sat beside him. Besides her mama, no one had ever seen anything she drew. Carmine\u2019s silence as he stared at it flustered her. \u201cI told you it wasn\u2019t good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTesoro, this is amazing! I\u2019m speechless, and you think it sucks?\u201d</p><p>She glanced at the picture in his hand. Although she\u2019d never seen one in person, she\u2019d looked up a hummingbird in a book in the library. It was the only sketch she\u2019d made that looked right to her. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cYes, really. This is the best thing anyone\u2019s ever done for me. I told you I wanted you for Christmas, and you gave it to me. This is beautiful. You\u2019re beautiful, colibri.\u201d</p><p>Haven stood frozen in the family room as she stared out the window. The backyard was encased in a thin layer of white, thick flakes continuing to fall from the sky like confetti.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t get much snow around here,\u201d Carmine said. \u201cIt never lasts long, but it\u2019s nice.\u201d</p><p>To her, nice didn\u2019t begin to cover it. It was beautiful. She walked to the window and pressed her hand to the frosty glass, her stomach fluttering as her eyes burned with tears. She thought of her mama then, the vision of her dancing in the snow. It was her happy spot, the place she went whenever she dreamed. Haven understood now. She yearned to go there, too.</p><p>A throat cleared behind her, and she turned to see that everyone had gathered. Dozens of presents of all shapes and sizes huddled under the fake tree, decorated in shiny paper with big bows. Haven sat on the couch, her nerves flaring as she gazed at them. Carmine hesitated but sat down beside her.</p><p>Dr. DeMarco handed out presents, and Haven was stunned when he set two in front of her. Dominic\u2019s name was written on the top one, and she glanced at the second to see unfamiliar handwriting. \u201cCelia,\u201d Carmine said, the same time Haven read the name on the tag.</p><p>The gift from Dominic was filled with art supplies, paints and paper and markers, while Celia\u2019s box contained an empty picture frame. Overwhelmed by their generosity, Haven could do nothing but whisper her thanks. She felt almost normal as she watched the others with their gifts, like she was simply a girl enjoying the small things in life. It warmed her heart to feel like a part of them.</p><p>Despite that, there was still that other part of her that felt guilty. As she gazed around at the living room littered with wrapping paper and plates of cookies, she felt like she was betraying her mama. There would be no gifts for her. No sweets. No laughs. No family. No snow. No love.</p><p>She had been so lost in thought that she hadn\u2019t noticed the room emptied until Carmine squeezed her knee. She jumped, startled, and he looked at her questioningly. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust thinking about my mama.\u201d</p><p>Carmine put his arm around her, pulling her to him. \u201cI miss mine, too.\u201d</p><p>Tess and Dia showed up a few minutes later, and everyone gathered in the family room once again while Haven lingered by the doorway. Dr. DeMarco and his sister laughed together over some whispered secret, and Tess sat on Dominic\u2019s lap as he squeezed her in a hug. Dia was telling a story, making Carmine chuckle. The love in the room was so pure and powerful that Haven\u2019s eyes misted from the intensity of it.</p><p>Carmine spotted her and patted the cushion beside him. \u201cWhy are you standing there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHabit, I guess,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m used to being on the outside looking in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we\u2019re gonna break that habit. You belong on the inside with me.\u201d</p><p>She gazed at him, smiling, before looking over his shoulder. A pair of dark eyes met hers, the penetrating gaze paralyzing. Dr. DeMarco was watching them, and he didn\u2019t look happy anymore. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTime to play in the snow!\u201d</p><p>Everyone jumped up at once as Dominic shouted those words, and Haven just sat there when they ran from the room. Celia laughed. \u201cAren\u2019t you joining them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I supposed to?\u201d Haven asked, looking to Dr. DeMarco for direction, but he said nothing, his expression giving her no hint.</p><p>\u201cIf you want to,\u201d Celia said, \u201cbut you\u2019ll need to bundle up.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>She headed upstairs, finding Carmine waiting for her. Haven put on some extra clothes before grabbing her coat. She wore so many layers she had a hard time walking down the stairs. The group headed for the back door, and Dominic collapsed to the ground right away, sending white stuff flying everywhere. He formed snowballs to pelt Carmine with, and Haven laughed as he threw some back. The fighting got out of control quickly. Haven ducked as Dia ran, snowballs barely missing them both. Tess wasn\u2019t lucky, though, and one slammed her in the chest.</p><p>Dia wandered off to snap pictures as Haven crouched down, running her hand through a pile of snow. She could feel the coldness through her gloves, the air chilly against her flushed face. She watched it drift through her fingers, captivated by the way it crunched when she made a fist.</p><p>The burden on her heart lessened. Just for a while, she allowed her guilt to ease.</p><p>Carmine strolled over to her. \u201cWanna go for a walk, tesoro?\u201d</p> <p>She nodded and trudged through the snow behind him. They hit the tree line, and Carmine took her gloved hand as they walked out toward the creek. He paused a foot away from it and glanced down at the rushing water, a look of longing embedded in his features. She stared at him, and he must have sensed her gaze, because he smirked after a second. \u201cLike something you see?\u201d</p><p>She nudged him. \u201cYou know I do.\u201d</p><p>They stood under the trees, hand in hand, as two squirrels ran by. Haven watched as they chased each other through the snow before scaling the tree beside them and leaping onto a branch. She ducked, realizing what they were doing, but Carmine was too slow. He looked up in time for one of the squirrels to hit a pile of snow and send it flying into his face.</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch!\u201d he said, pulling his hand from hers to brush the snow away. She laughed as she watched him, and he cut his eyes to her. \u201cSomething funny?\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip to hold in the laughter. The moment she finally got herself under control, the squirrel came running along the tree again, more of the snow falling onto Carmine.</p><p>There was a mischievous glint in Carmine\u2019s eye when Haven laughed again. She turned to run as he started toward her, recognizing the expression from the fiasco with the dishwasher, but she only got a few steps away before her foot caught on something. She fell into the snow face-first, a rush of cold instantly overtaking her body.</p> <p>\u201cSee?\u201d Carmine said. \u201cThat\u2019s what happens when you laugh at me.\u201d</p><p>She rolled over to look at him and tossed a handful of snow at his chest. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what happens when you laugh at me.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled, pulling her to her feet. \u201cYou\u2019re covered now.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s just water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust water? You can get frostbitten, or sick, or even pneumonia. Fuck, there\u2019s hypothermia. All sorts of things could happen. You might lose a toe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarmine, I was born prematurely in the horse stables, and I survived. I\u2019ve had the daylights beaten out of me, and I survived. I\u2019ve had a gun shoved against my throat, and I survived. It\u2019s frozen water . . . I\u2019ll survive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re saying you\u2019re a survivor again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I just got my thesaurus, so I haven\u2019t had time to find other words for it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCarry on,\u201d he said. \u201cKeep living. Remain alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t they definitions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSynonym, definition . . . same difference. It\u2019s just a technicality.\u201d</p><p>Staring at him, Haven fought back her laughter again. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s the word you want.\u201d</p><p>He ignored her. \u201cYou know, I was premature too. A few weeks early. My mom always wanted a bunch of kids, but they stopped after me. I never understood why.\u201d</p><p>His voice was wistful. Haven closed the distance between them and wrapped her arms around his neck. \u201cMaybe they realized they created perfection with you and didn\u2019t need any more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m far from perfect, Haven,\u201d he said. \u201cI have more flaws than I do good parts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have flaws, but that\u2019s part of what makes you wonderful. You are perfect\u2014perfect for me.\u201d She reached up on her tiptoes and kissed him softly before whispering against his lips. \u201cBesides, flaws, no flaws, perfect, not perfect . . . they\u2019re probably just technicalities, too.\u201d</p><p>The sound of Carmine\u2019s laughter warmed her frozen skin.</p><p>24</p><p>Vincent stood in the family room, gazing into the backyard at the kids playing in the snow. He couldn\u2019t recall the last time he saw both of his boys happy at the same time. For years he watched his youngest in a perpetual state of turmoil, his soul broken and heart torn. Vincent blamed himself for that, for not doing more to ease his worries.</p><p>His child, so much like Maura\u2014Vincent had failed him long ago.</p><p>Celia stood beside Vincent. \u201cCarmine was playing the piano this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMoonlight Sonata?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Vincent could hear the smile in her voice. \u201cJingle Bells.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInteresting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInteresting is right,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you didn\u2019t tell me!\u201d</p><p>He knew what she was referring to by the look on her face. \u201cWhat did you want me to say? That my son is an idiot?\u201d</p><p>Celia jabbed him in the ribs with her elbow. \u201cDon\u2019t call him that. He cares about her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a novelty,\u201d Vincent said. \u201cThe newness will wear off, and he\u2019ll move on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, give me a break. Even you don\u2019t believe that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne can always hope.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cThey make each other happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re both idiots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVincent!\u201d Celia pushed him. He stumbled a few steps and snickered as Celia grabbed his arm again. \u201cSo, what are you going to do about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d It was the truth; he had no idea how to handle the situation. \u201cI considered sending her to Chicago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe would\u2019ve taken her.\u201d He looked at Celia skeptically, and she smiled. \u201cI would\u2019ve convinced Corrado somehow.\u201d</p><p>Vincent doubted even Celia could have talked him into getting involved. He\u2019d been refusing to intervene for years, and Vincent couldn\u2019t blame him. It was a disaster.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter now. I missed my window of opportunity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVincent, you\u2019re a fool if you believe you ever had a window of opportunity.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t respond. There was nothing to say. His sister was right, but he didn\u2019t want to admit it.</p><p>He\u2019d known for a while what was happening. He\u2019d feared the worst that first morning until he heard what his son said when he let go of Haven\u2019s wrist. It was such a simple word, a word most people used needlessly, but a powerful word to people like them. It was something Carmine hadn\u2019t said since he was an innocent eight-year-old child, ignorant of the world\u2019s troubles, but he\u2019d uttered it that morning so casually, so nonchalantly, that Vincent wondered if he knew what he was saying.</p><p>The word was sorry.</p><p>It was a word even Vincent couldn\u2019t bring himself to say. His sister would say he was a good man, a decent man with a heart full of compassion, and Maura would have said the same thing. She never saw the evil inside him. Neither of them did.</p><p>When his wife was stolen from him, the blackness took over. He became possessed by it, consumed by anger and guilt. No matter how many people he killed in his quest for vengeance, his thirst for blood never went away. That timid brown-haired girl, the one his youngest had grown fond of, almost became a casualty in his need for retaliation.</p><p>Vincent pulled away from Celia and sat down, rubbing his face in frustration. Celia sat across from him and laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s cute how slick they think they are. Reminds me of how you and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d he said. Celia cut off midsentence and playfully pretended to zip her lips. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing cute about any of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, come on. It is cute! And why can\u2019t you let them be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know why,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t honestly think it\u2019s smart for them to be together.\u201d</p><p>Celia glared at him. \u201cShouldn\u2019t that be their decision?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t know any better.\u201d</p><p>She raised an eyebrow. \u201cMaybe you should explain. Tell him the truth.\u201d</p><p>He laughed bitterly. \u201cThe truth, Celia? Exactly which truth are you talking about? Do you want me to tell him all of it, even the part that\u2019s going to hurt? He\u2019s a lot like me now, and you have to admit there\u2019s a possibility he might snap. Carmine and I barely have a relationship as it is, and this could ruin the last bit we have left. Is that what you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know it\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, you want me to tell him enough of the truth to make him believe it\u2019s okay for them to be together, but I can\u2019t mislead him with bits and pieces. It\u2019s all or nothing.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cI wish there was a way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to find some middle ground in the whole thing, but I\u2019m not seeing a way out of this. I know what I\u2019m supposed to do, but the potential wrath that might come down on us is too much to bear. Not to mention it would be throwing the girl to the wolves. And if that happens, I can\u2019t imagine the lengths my son will go to for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t dwell on the what-ifs, Vincent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always dwell on them,\u201d he said. \u201cI barely sleep at night, wondering how one little thing could have changed it all. What if I hadn\u2019t taken Maura that weekend? What if we had gone earlier? What if we had gone later? Why did we have to be at that exact spot at that exact moment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that day hadn\u2019t happened, that girl outside would be dead. You\u2019re saving her, and she\u2019s healing him.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cIf we hadn\u2019t been there, Celia, my son wouldn\u2019t need to be healed.\u201d</p><p>Vincent would never forget the day that started it all, and how he felt driving down that long, vacant road in the desert for the first time. He\u2019d been miserable, sweat dripping from his brow. The car was completely silent besides the sound of the rumbling engine. Maura knew he hated the silent treatment. He\u2019d rather be yelled at than for her to sit there as she was, staring out the window with that blank expression on her face.</p><p>He had no idea, as he slammed his hands against the steering wheel, that it was just the beginning of a vexing day. \u201cIf you don\u2019t say something, Maura, I\u2019m going to spontaneously combust.\u201d</p><p>She exhaled sharply but still said nothing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat do you want me to do? Huh? It\u2019s my responsibility!\u201d</p><p>His outburst was met with her scathing voice. \u201cIt\u2019s our anniversary. It\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that, but they don\u2019t care. When my father says go, I have to go.\u201d</p><p>She knew when he took the oath that he\u2019d vowed to be there anytime la famiglia called on him, twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, three hundred and sixty-five days a year.</p> <p>Vincent slowed the car when they neared the cutoff in the desert that led to Frankie Antonelli\u2019s property. They climbed out when they reached the house, but Maura lingered by the car. Vincent stepped onto the porch and knocked on the door at the same time a high-pitched squeal rang out. Swinging around, he saw a frail little girl running straight at Maura, knee-high and skinny as a toothpick, her hair matted in dreadlocks. She looked like a sewer rat, covered in filth.</p><p>The girl, oblivious to the presence in her path, slammed right into Maura without slowing down. Maura stumbled from the force, and the little girl flew backward onto the ground. Her dirt-smudged nose scrunched up as she eyed the human roadblock.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re awfully dirty, little one,\u201d Maura said.</p><p>The little girl looked down at herself. \u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>Maura laughed as she crouched down. \u201cYou\u2019re dirty everywhere.\u201d</p> <p>It only took Vincent thirty minutes to handle business that day, but it was a half hour that changed everything. The girl had come barreling into his life, turning everything upside down.</p><p>At Maura\u2019s insistence, Vincent inquired about her a week later, but Frankie informed him she wasn\u2019t for sale. No matter how much money he offered, the man wouldn\u2019t budge. Vincent hoped Maura would drop it, but the child became an obsession to her.</p><p>And he had been oblivious to it all, living in his shell of ignorance. He was a keen person, but his wife had spent her entire life wearing a mask of secrecy. He had no idea what she was up to, although he should have been aware.</p><p>He should have known she would see it as a second chance.</p><p>Vincent stood up. \u201cWhen they come inside, tell her to come on up to my office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou know who, Celia.\u201d</p><p>Before he turned around, he saw his sister shake her head. \u201cI still don\u2019t understand why you never say her name.\u201d</p><p>Vincent was typing an email when there was a timid tap on the door. It opened slowly, and she stepped inside. She was a tough girl, the type who kept secrets well. A lot like his wife that way. That thought made him feel like he had been kicked in the gut.</p><p>He motioned for her to sit down. \u201cAre you having a good day, child?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. May I ask you a question?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore I brought you here, do you recall ever seeing me?\u201d</p> <p>Her face scrunched up, and he smiled involuntarily. It reminded him of the look she gave Maura that day. \u201cNo, sir,\u201d she said hesitantly.</p><p>\u201cThe first time I met you, you were six years old,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, you told my wife you were six, but you held up four fingers.\u201d</p><p>She looked startled. \u201cYour wife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my wife,\u201d he said. \u201cI suppose you wouldn\u2019t remember her, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn apology is unnecessary,\u201d he said. \u201cAnyway, the reason I asked you up here is because I have something to give you.\u201d</p><p>He opened his desk drawer and pulled out the photograph, sliding it across to her. \u201cI saw your mother a few weeks ago while on business and snapped that picture.\u201d</p><p>Haven picked up the photo with a trembling hand, her composure slipping. She traced her mother\u2019s outline with her pointer finger. \u201cThank you for showing me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. That\u2019s all I wanted, so you can rejoin the festivities.\u201d She stood up and glanced at the picture briefly before holding it out to him. He shook his head. \u201cKeep it. It\u2019s the reason Celia gave you a frame.\u201d</p><p>Carmine climbed out of the shower and wrapped a towel around his waist, surprised to see Haven sitting on the edge of his bed. She clutched a picture, her focus squarely on it. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>She glanced at him, her eyes bloodshot. \u201cMy mama.\u201d</p><p>Intense dread rushed through him. \u201cYour mom? Did something happen to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s a picture of her. Your father gave it to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that was awfully nice of him.\u201d He ran a hand through his wet hair as he sat down beside her. He reached for the picture, but she automatically gripped it tighter in response. \u201cI just wanna see, hummingbird. I\u2019ll give it right back.\u201d</p><p>She smiled sheepishly, handing it to him.</p><p>He surveyed the photo of the skinny woman with short hair, standing in front of a large wooden house. Beside it was a row of old horse stables, behind them a greenhouse and some storage buildings.</p><p>Haven rested her head on his shoulder. \u201cNow you see where I came from.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe they made you sleep outside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t so bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t so bad? There\u2019s a lot more to life than just being not so bad. How about being happy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHappiness is nothing but good health and a poor memory.\u201d</p><p>His brow furrowed. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlbert Schweitzer said it.\u201d</p><p>He rolled his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re too smart for your own good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said genuinely. \u201cNo one has ever called me smart before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrego.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him. \u201cPrego? The spaghetti sauce?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cIt means you\u2019re welcome in Italian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She turned her attention back to the photo. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you have a picture of your mama?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, but they\u2019re hard to look at.\u201d</p><p>Haven smiled softly. \u201cI bet she\u2019s beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course she is,\u201d he said playfully. \u201cShe made me.\u201d</p><p>Vincent sat in the silent office for a moment before opening his top desk drawer again. He pushed a few things around and grabbed the small photograph from the bottom. It had been there for years, the edges worn and image faded although it rarely saw the light of day.</p><p>He gazed at the picture of his wife, his chest aching. He desperately wished she were there because, out of everyone, she\u2019d be able to tell him what to do. She would know what to say, how to make it right again. Maura always had the answers, even if they were ones Vincent hadn\u2019t liked to hear.</p><p>Reaching into his shirt, he pulled out the chain that hung around his neck and absentmindedly fiddled with the small gold band. It matched the one he still wore on his finger. He never had the nerve to take it off.</p><p>Carmine pulled out a chair for Haven in the dining room and sat across from her. Tess and Dia stayed for dinner, sitting on the side with Haven, while Dominic and Celia sat near Carmine. Vincent took the chair at the head of the table and bowed his head, saying his usual prayer.</p><p>They told stories about past holidays, and Haven listened intently, absorbing every word. Her eyes twinkled, a smile on her lips. It was an odd moment, but as Carmine glanced around the table, it felt right, like they were supposed to be there. That she belonged with him, with all of them, and some twist of fate had led her there.</p><p>He didn\u2019t care what she said\u2014happiness was more than good health and a poor memory. Happiness was this. It was her, and him, and that moment. Fuck Albert Schweitzer. He could kiss his ass. Happiness was real.</p><p>After dinner, Haven and Carmine headed upstairs to his room. She wrapped her arms around his neck, her fingers lacing through his hair as she pulled him to her, kissing him passionately. He resisted at first, caught off guard, but caved and walked her back to the bed. Pulling off his shirt, he tossed it to the floor before lying down on top of her. She rocked her hips, pressing into him. Carmine hissed as the unexpected friction sent shivers through him.</p><p>He wanted her more than he had ever wanted anything. He wanted to consume her, to taste her flesh and explore her body. And he wanted to fuck her, but he couldn\u2019t. She wasn\u2019t a girl to be fucked. She was a girl to be made love to, and as much as he wished he could, he didn\u2019t know how.</p><p>He pulled from her lips, his strong voice contradicting the yearn in his body. \u201cWe need to stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, stop.\u201d He hesitated\u2014when the hell had he become the voice of abstinence? \u201cWe just, you know . . .\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t know, but she nodded. \u201cOkay, Romeo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRomeo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike in Romeo and Juliet. They come from different sides but meet in the middle. We have the forbidden love part, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but we\u2019re not killing ourselves, Haven, so that\u2019s about as similar as it gets. Besides, Romeo\u2019s an idiot. Pick someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about Shrek?\u201d</p><p>His brow furrowed. \u201cShrek? Really? He\u2019s an ogre.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShrek and Fiona thought they were different when they weren\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He contemplated that until he realized he was comparing his life to a cartoon. \u201cPick another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTitanic? Rose and Jack weren\u2019t supposed to be together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously? He dies. I\u2019m not gonna jinx myself here.\u201d</p><p>She was quiet, running her fingers across his abs and tracing his scar with her fingertips. \u201cHow about we just be Haven and Carmine? We don\u2019t know the ending, but we can always hope for the best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like that,\u201d he said. \u201cBesides, there\u2019s a reason we don\u2019t know how the story ends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>25</p><p>Haven opened the dryer door and flung the wet clothes into it, listening as everyone chatted in the foyer. Celia had a flight to Chicago in a few hours, and Dr. DeMarco was going with her for a few days. They were saying good-bye, so she\u2019d slipped away and secluded herself in the laundry room, feeling like she was unfairly imposing on family time.</p><p>There was a light tap from the doorway after a moment, and she turned to see Celia. Haven stiffened when she wrapped her arms around her in a hug. \u201cIt\u2019s been great getting to know you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou too, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall me Celia, dear,\u201d she said. \u201cI have to go before Vincent complains, but I couldn\u2019t leave without saying good-bye to you.\u201d</p><p>Haven was touched she cared so much. \u201cGood-bye, Celia.\u201d</p><p>Celia smoothed Haven\u2019s hair before walking away. Haven turned back to the dryer, and Carmine strolled in after they left. \u201cDia wants to know what time we\u2019re going tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think I should go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Why wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, your friends will be there. I\u2019ll probably just be a complication.\u201d</p><p>Truth was, it was New Year\u2019s Eve, and she didn\u2019t want to watch Carmine from afar all night.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ever call yourself a complication,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd yeah, I want you to come.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>He ran his hands down his face with frustration. \u201cOkay? We\u2019re back to that again? If you don\u2019t wanna go, say so. I\u2019ll stay home too. I just thought it would be nice to get out tonight. And honestly, everyone knows about us already because of Lisa\u2019s big mouth. Damn schifosa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s a schifosa?</p><p>He tugged at his hair. \u201cAn ugly girl.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you really think she\u2019s ugly, or are you saying that because you\u2019re angry with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s all right, I guess.\u201d</p><p>She smiled to herself. \u201cI\u2019ll go tonight. I just don\u2019t want to embarrass my boyfriend in front of the schifosas he goes to school with.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her like he was dissecting her words. \u201cThat\u2019s the first time you\u2019ve called me that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalled you what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYour boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated. \u201cIsn\u2019t that what you are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve just never acknowledged it before. I was starting to wonder if you were embarrassed.\u201d</p><p>The New Year\u2019s Eve party was being held in a vacant field on the outskirts of Durante, a cotton farm that had been abandoned years before. The barn still stood, empty and collapsing, the ground overgrown from lack of use.</p><p>Haven eyed the place peculiarly as Carmine parked, dozens of cars surrounding them. It was already late, everything shrouded in darkness, but Haven could see a large bonfire in the distance. Carmine took her hand as they strolled through the field. A few people greeted him, but Carmine seemed distracted. He diverted them to the left, taking her to where Dia stood by herself along the side. \u201cI\u2019ll be back, okay? Stay here.\u201d</p><p>He looked torn as he let go of her hand before walking away. This was the reason she had considered not coming in the first place. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine on my own. You can go have fun, Dia.\u201d</p> <p>Dia laughed. \u201cFun? I think not. This is so not my scene. I\u2019d rather hang out with you.\u201d</p><p>Her response surprised Haven, but she was relieved when the words sank in.</p><p>The two of them chatted for a bit, and people walked past as if they weren\u2019t there. Haven heard familiar laughter eventually and turned around in enough time to see Dominic before he draped his arm over her shoulder. Tess paused in front of them as Dominic thrust a cup at Haven. \u201cHere, got you a drink. Don\u2019t take anything from any of these other fuckers around here.\u201d</p><p>She took it from him, sniffing the liquid. \u201cUh, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure thing. I didn\u2019t know what you\u2019d want, so I just got you some beer from the keg. I figured you wouldn\u2019t like it, but none of us do and we drink it anyway.\u201d He raised his own cup and hit hers with it. \u201cWelcome to the club.\u201d</p><p>He tipped back his drink, chugging, as Haven took a sip and grimaced at the bitterness. She drank the beer despite its taste and loosened up as they joked around. She laughed along with them, almost feeling like she fit in.</p><p>\u201cHey, Dom.\u201d</p><p>The voice rang out behind them. Dominic turned, swinging Haven around with him. She tripped over her own feet when she saw Nicholas.</p> <p>Dominic and Nicholas bumped fists. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot much.\u201d Nicholas nodded his head toward Haven. \u201cYou decide to trade Tess in?\u201d</p><p>Dominic laughed. \u201cNo, I\u2019m just watching over this one so the vultures don\u2019t circle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I heard Lisa running her mouth earlier.\u201d Nicholas turned to her. \u201cNice to see you again, Haven.\u201d</p><p>She was surprised he was being nice after what happened during their last meeting. \u201cYou, too.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cSo, what did one snowman say to the other?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know, what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmells like carrots.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t get it, but Dominic laughed.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, I just wanted to say hi,\u201d Nicholas said. \u201cI\u2019ll catch you guys later.\u201d</p><p>He walked away, and Haven looked at Dominic curiously. \u201cYou still like him after he said something bad about your mama?\u201d</p><p>Dominic nodded. \u201cNicholas shouldn\u2019t have said what he said, but he just wanted to hurt Carmine. And before you came along, Twinkle Toes, the only way to hurt him was through Mom.\u201d</p><p>Dominic swung her back around to join the others, and they chatted as she drank the rest of her beer. A little later, she heard a chuckle nearby, so close it made her skin prickle. Carmine leaned down, his lips beside her ear. \u201cHey, hummingbird.\u201d</p><p>Carmine\u2019s breath hit her neck, the smell of mint and alcohol intoxicating her senses. She couldn\u2019t focus on what was going on, the electricity sparking off him sending currents through her. She felt lightweight, buzzing, on top of the world.</p><p>She worried she was going to fall over.</p><p>He pulled her to him from behind, resting his chin on her head as he held his drink to her lips. She took a sip, his warm beer as bitter as hers had been.</p><p>Dominic groaned. \u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you not to take cups from people?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just Carmine,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cSo? He could drug you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could,\u201d Carmine joked. \u201cI did once, remember? Actually, no, twice. I forgot I got you high that time, too. Not to mention the time I got you drunk. Christ, I\u2019m horrible. I\u2019ve corrupted you.\u201d</p><p>She wanted to disagree but could only grasp on to his forearms as he kissed her neck. The feel of his mouth against her skin ripped all coherent thought right from her head.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re trembling,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s take a walk.\u201d</p><p>Carmine grabbed her hand, linking their fingers together as he wordlessly led her through the parked cars. He kissed her, and she parted her lips, deepening it as he walked her backward to the Mazda. Breaking the kiss briefly, he grabbed her, and she yelped with surprise as he set her down on the hood. He settled between her legs, and she laced her fingers through his hair as their lips met once more.</p><p>Her heart raced at the closeness. His body was flush against hers, the heat radiating from him warming every inch of her. He pulled away slightly to take a breath, their foreheads touching with a light sheen of sweat on his. Her nose brushed against his as she stared into his eyes, the green radiant. Looking into them, she could see the emotion inside him, hints of all those things flourishing in her. To Carmine, she wasn\u2019t a possession. She wasn\u2019t a title. She was just a girl.</p><p>A girl who suddenly felt like she was floating.</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d The words tumbled from her lips easily, like they had rolled from her tongue hundreds of times. But they hadn\u2019t. She had never said them before, but as she heard them in her own voice, every cell in her body knew they were true. She hadn\u2019t known what love was, but she knew it now. Love was the fluttering in her tummy whenever Carmine was near, the twinkle in his eyes when he laughed, the heat in her body from his words. Love was happy. Love was safe. Love was green.</p><p>Love was him\u2014the beautifully flawed boy who made her glow.</p><p>He stared at her, those words hanging in the air between them.</p><p>\u201cAnd I love you,\u201d he said, his voice a whisper, but Haven felt it powerfully, deep down in her soul. \u201cPer sempre.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSempre?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Cracking a smile, he brushed his pointer finger softly across her lips. \u201cAlways and forever.\u201d</p><p>A loud whistling sounded out at that moment, followed by a thunderous bang. Haven ducked and covered her ears as Carmine continued to stare at her. \u201cIt\u2019s fireworks.\u201d</p><p>He helped her down and leaned against the car door with her to his chest, his arms around her. There was another loud whistle, and she looked in the direction of it as the bang rang out with a burst of color. She gaped at the vibrant lights in the sky, and Carmine chuckled. \u201cSee, just fireworks, tesoro. Nothing to be afraid of. They won\u2019t hurt you.\u201d</p><p>They watched them quietly before the crowd by the bonfire counted down. Carmine swung her around to face him, more fireworks going off in the distance. He leaned down and kissed her deeply when the countdown reached one.</p><p>\u201cDo you have any idea how important you are to me?\u201d he asked, pulling from her lips. \u201cI\u2019m finding myself again because of you. I never thought it would happen. My mom used to talk about fate, and I think you\u2019re it . . . you\u2019re my fate. You were brought to me for a reason, for us to save each other. Because you weren\u2019t the only one needing to be saved, Haven. I was drowning, and you rescued me.\u201d He paused. \u201cHappy new year, hummingbird.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cYou said all of that without cursing.\u201d</p><p>He blinked a few times. \u201cI guess I did. Well, then . . . fuck.\u201d</p><p>Carmine held Haven tightly, the two of them enjoying the newfound silence. The fireworks had stopped and the crowd quieted, so all that was left was the two of them in the darkness. He could smell her shampoo, feminine and sweet, and all he could think about was how sexy she looked. Those other girls, with their and miniskirts and makeup, weren\u2019t sexy to him anymore. La mia bella ragazza, with her chewed-up fingernails and flushed cheeks, was sexy. Because sexiness wasn\u2019t manufactured\u2014the shit was real.</p><p>She was real.</p><p>\u201cI never hoped for a future until I met you,\u201d she said after a while, \u201cbut I want us to have one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know how much I love hearing you say that.\u201d He brushed her hair aside and ran his tongue up her neck, circling her earlobe. \u201cCan I keep you?\u201d he whispered, laughing and pulling away from her as soon as the words came out. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with me? I\u2019m quoting Casper.\u201d</p><p>She glanced back at him. \u201cCasper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Casper the friendly ghost.\u201d He hoped she knew what he was talking about, but she just stared at him. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s some stupid movie. You\u2019d probably like it.\u201d</p><p>A hard edge laced her voice. \u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d</p><p>He blanched. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean it like that. I wasn\u2019t suggesting you\u2019d like it because it was stupid or because you\u2019re stupid.\u201d He groaned. \u201cNot that you\u2019re stupid, because you aren\u2019t. That didn\u2019t come out right. You know I don\u2019t think that. You\u2019d have to be fucking stupid not to see you\u2019re smart.\u201d He paused. \u201cI should probably shut up now.\u201d</p><p>The corner of her lips turned up as she leaned back against him. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor knowing when to shut up?\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cNo, for always thinking about my feelings. I know that\u2019s not something you\u2019re used to doing. I\u2019ve never had someone look out for me before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll always do what\u2019s best for you, Haven,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve thought about it a lot, you know. After I turn eighteen and can access my trust fund, we could disappear together and get away from all of this bullshit. Probably couldn\u2019t take the Mazda, though, since it has a GPS chip in it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA GPS chip,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Carmine looked at his watch. \u201cYou wanna head home?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. They climbed into the car, and he put it in gear, driving down the small road toward the highway as Haven looked out the side window at the trees lining the road. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d She was being too silent.</p><p>\u201cI thought you knew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnew what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I was chipped, too.\u201d</p> <p>He looked at her with confusion, turning down the music in the car. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike your car\u2014a GPS chip.\u201d</p><p>Carmine slammed the brakes as soon as the words registered, the car skidding to a stop with a loud squeal. Haven braced her hands against the dash, eyes wide with shock.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a tracking chip on you? Where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s in me,\u201d she said. \u201cUnder my skin.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve gotta be kidding. Your father chipped you like a dog?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cMy father didn\u2019t do it. Yours did.\u201d</p><p>He blinked a few times. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure. He stuck the needle into my back. He also scraped my cheek with some kind of cotton swab. I don\u2019t know why, but he did it. He said I can never escape. It\u2019s impossible.\u201d</p><p>Carmine\u2019s stomach sank. He was going to be sick.</p><p>Vincent stepped off the elevator on the fifth floor of the Belden Stratford Hotel and strolled toward his room at the end of the hall. The dim lighting was easy on his tired eyes. He couldn\u2019t recall the last time he\u2019d gotten a good night\u2019s sleep, his hectic schedule taking a toll on him.</p> <p>Jet-lagged, he was looking forward to having some down time. The next ten hours of his schedule were uncharacteristically clear, and he had no intention of doing anything but lying in bed. He was sick of traveling. Sick of working. Sick of talking. Sick of thinking. He wanted, for once, to savor a bit of peace.</p><p>The moment he stepped into his hotel room, the phone in his pocket rang. He looked at the clock\u2014six in the morning.</p><p>He pulled out his phone, too exhausted to deal with business, and was surprised to see it was Carmine. Vincent sat down on the edge of the bed. \u201cIsn\u2019t it a bit early for you to be up, son?\u201d</p><p>Carmine sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s called insomnia, remember? I never sleep.\u201d</p><p>Vincent knew the feeling well. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing\u2019s wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cCan\u2019t I call my father to wish him a happy new year?\u201d</p><p>Vincent was surprised. Carmine had certainly never called for casual conversation before. \u201cHappy new year to you, too. Did you all have a nice night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was okay, I guess.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo fighting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t send anyone to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he said, yawning. The sky outside was starting to lighten as dawn approached. \u201cWhat are you guys going to do today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Carmine said, \u201cbut I guess you\u2019ll be able to tell later. You know, because of the tracking chip in Haven.\u201d</p><p>The words went straight over Vincent\u2019s head. It took a minute for them to sink in. \u201cShe told you about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe may have mentioned it,\u201d he said. \u201cShe also may have said you swabbed her cheek. She isn\u2019t, like, our cousin or something, is she? Illegitimate child? Were you fucking around on Mom?\u201d</p><p>Vincent sighed. \u201cOf course not. There\u2019s no blood relation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, whatever. I was just curious.\u201d</p><p>Vincent closed his eyes. His son was on to him.</p><p>Peace was fleeting once again.</p><p>26</p><p>The first week of January swiftly passed as the boys headed back to school. Haven lay in bed for a while that Friday morning before strolling into the library. Glancing toward the stairs, she gasped and grabbed her chest. Dr. DeMarco stood in front of her with his arms crossed.</p><p>He had been in Chicago all week, so he was the last person she expected to see. She stared at him, wondering when he\u2019d gotten home, but more curious as to what he was doing on the third floor. There was a part of her\u2014the part that would never forget what he did\u2014that screamed something wasn\u2019t right. She searched for some hidden emotion and saw a flicker of aggravation in his eyes.</p><p>The monster lurked today. \u201cGood morning, Dr. DeMarco.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood morning.\u201d His voice was cold and detached. \u201cGrab your coat and meet me downstairs.\u201d</p><p>Fear consumed her, but she tried to keep her outward composure. He continued to stare at her, waiting for acknowledgment. She didn\u2019t know why\u2014it wasn\u2019t as if she could say no. If he told her to be somewhere, she\u2019d be there if she wanted to or not.</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>She exhaled sharply once he was gone, shaking her head as she grabbed her coat. She stuck her hands into her pockets as she descended the stairs, her palms sweaty. Was this the end of her time here? Was he tired of her? What would he do to her? Would he sell her? What if she never saw Carmine again?</p><p>In the middle of her near-breakdown, a hand gripped her shoulder. She recoiled from Dr. DeMarco behind her. \u201cYou\u2019re awfully jumpy today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at his watch. \u201cCome on. I don\u2019t want to be late.\u201d</p><p>Dr. DeMarco opened the front door, and she kept her head down as she stepped outside. He set the alarm and locked up, brushing past her to the car as if she weren\u2019t there.</p><p>Haven stared in the side mirror as he drove down the driveway, watching the house disappear behind the rows of dense trees. Sighing, she glanced at Dr. DeMarco, wishing she knew what bothered him. She kept her gaze on him for too long, and he glanced over at her. \u201cIt\u2019s rude to stare, child. If you have a question, ask it. Otherwise, mind your manners. I\u2019m not in the mood for insolence today.\u201d</p><p>She had no idea what insolence was, but she had no intention of giving it to him. \u201cI was wondering where we were going, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hospital,\u201d he said, the same time Haven spotted the building in the distance. He pulled into a front parking spot and turned off the car. \u201cJust like the football game, I expect you to be on your best behavior.\u201d</p><p>She sat still, staring out the windshield at the sign with DR. VINCENT DEMARCO written on it in blue. \u201cI\u2019ll be good, sir.\u201d</p><p>Haven followed him into the building, keeping his pace so as not to lag behind. They headed straight for the elevator and despite the fact that it only took thirty seconds, her anxiety tripled during the ride to the third floor. Logically she knew Dr. DeMarco wouldn\u2019t hurt her in public, but it wasn\u2019t easy being rational when confined in a small box with a man capable of harm.</p><p>She breathed a sigh of relief as the doors opened, and she followed Dr. DeMarco down a long corridor. Watching her feet, she didn\u2019t notice he\u2019d stopped until she ran into him. Gasping, she took a few steps back and held her hands up to shield herself. Dr. DeMarco stood in place, his hand twitching at his side. He balled it into a fist, fighting to keep his temper in check.</p><p>Pulling out a set of keys, he unlocked a door and flicked on a light inside the room. \u201cSit down. I\u2019ll be back.\u201d</p><p>As soon as she stepped into the room, his footsteps receded down the hallway. She stood in one spot, reading his nameplate on the desk, before surveying the rest of the office. It was orderly, books lining a shelf and folders neatly stacked on his desk. There weren\u2019t any personal items, no family pictures or WORLD\u2019S GREATEST DAD coffee mugs. The walls were white and plain, everything wooden except for the black leather chairs.</p><p>It looked like the house\u2014sterilized.</p><p>She sat in one of the chairs and folded her hands in her lap, picking at her fingernails. Dr. DeMarco returned eventually and sat down behind his desk, putting on his glasses. She risked a peek at him and saw he was reading a file. He sensed her eyes again and sighed dramatically. \u201cAsk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was wondering why we were here, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI needed to get back to work, and you need a shot.\u201d He pulled a book off a shelf and handed it to her. \u201cA nurse will be around in a while, but other than that, you\u2019re going to be sitting here most of the day. May as well entertain yourself, since you apparently know how to read now.\u201d</p><p>Dr. DeMarco\u2019s office was silent, except for the sound of the occasional turning page. Haven fidgeted as the minutes slowly passed. After a while there was a knock at the door, and Dr. DeMarco stood up to answer it. \u201cGood afternoon.\u201d</p><p>A young blonde-haired woman walked in, smiling sweetly at Dr. DeMarco. \u201cHappy birthday!\u201d</p><p>Haven froze. No one had told her it was his birthday.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d he said, not sounding enthusiastic as he turned to Haven. \u201cI\u2019ll grab some lunch.\u201d</p><p>He narrowed his eyes in a silent warning before walking out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Jen,\u201d the woman said once he was gone. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet the girl who whipped Carmine into shape. How did you manage that, anyway?\u201d</p><p>Her heart rate spiked as Jen pulled out a needle. \u201cI don\u2019t know . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s unexplainable, huh? That boy used to land himself or someone else in the ER every week with all the fighting he did. It\u2019s been months since it\u2019s happened. Dr. DeMarco has to be happy.\u201d She paused, smiling widely. \u201cTurn around and unbutton your jeans. This has to go in the rear.\u201d</p><p>Haven did as she was told, wincing as the needle penetrated her skin.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe the worst medical attention Carmine causes anyone these days is for his girlfriend to get birth control.\u201d</p><p>Birth control? She pulled her pants back up as the door opened and Dr. DeMarco walked in. He set two food containers on his desk, pushing one toward Haven as she retook her seat. Haven opened her container and poked at the food.</p><p>\u201cYou two enjoy your lunch,\u201d Jen said. \u201cOnce again, it\u2019s nice to meet you, Haven. Don\u2019t let those DeMarco men give you too much trouble. Sometimes you have to show them who\u2019s boss.\u201d</p><p>Dr. DeMarco let out a laugh at those words.</p><p>Jen started to walk out but paused in the doorway. \u201cPlus, I\u2019ve heard Carmine likes kinky girls.\u201d</p><p>The amusement died in Dr. DeMarco\u2019s eyes, his expression twisting again to aggravation. As the door shut, Haven\u2019s hand trembled and shook the fork.</p><p>\u201cEat,\u201d Dr. DeMarco said forcefully. She flinched from his harsh tone and took a bite, so nauseated she had a hard time swallowing. After about ten minutes of thick tension and forcing down half of her food, she set her fork aside, hoping that would satisfy him.</p><p>He grabbed her container and dropped it into the trash can with a thud. She watched as he picked up his office phone and dialed a number, putting it on speakerphone as it rang. Dread rocked her when the familiar voice answered the line.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Carmine said. \u201cWhy are you calling me at lunch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to see you at the hospital as soon as you get out of school.\u201d</p><p>There was a pause. \u201cI didn\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>Dr. DeMarco sighed. \u201cDidn\u2019t do what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you think I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust come to my office,\u201d Dr. DeMarco said. \u201cI\u2019m not in the mood for your antics today.\u201d</p><p>He hung up before Carmine could respond, his attention shifting to Haven. \u201cIt\u2019s my birthday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHappy birthday, sir,\u201d she said. \u201cNo one told me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s because there\u2019s nothing to celebrate. It may be the day I was given life, but it\u2019s also the day my life was taken from me. I may be able to hop into the car and drive to the store, but it doesn\u2019t mean anything. Anything I\u2019m told to do, I have to do it or face death. Were you aware of that aspect of my life?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. She wasn\u2019t aware of much. Carmine alluded to the things his father did, but he never elaborated. Nobody did.</p><p>Dr. DeMarco continued after a moment. \u201cI\u2019ve watched it happen too many times. Men ordered to murder their own family, and they either do it or die themselves. The man who visited the house? He\u2019s my master, just as\u2014no matter what I do\u2014you\u2019ll continue to see me as your master. Because I hold the key to your survival, just as Sal holds the key to mine. I wasn\u2019t much older than Carmine when I got involved, and I was as stupid then as he is now. He has no idea what it is he\u2019s getting himself into\u2014neither of you do.\u201d</p><p>Haven was too stunned to speak. She waited for him to say something else, but instead he picked up his pen. She figured the conversation was over and reached for the book to pass the time when Dr. DeMarco\u2019s voice rang out, paralyzing her. \u201cAre you in love with him?\u201d</p> <p>The book slipped and hit the floor. \u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know who,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t pretend to be dumb with me.\u201d</p><p>Bile rose up at his demanding tone. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed a black case, and Haven\u2019s heart raced as he moved to sit in the chair beside her. He pulled out his laptop and set it on the desk so they both could see. \u201cCarmine asked if you had a tracking chip inside you. I wasn\u2019t happy he inquired about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI, uh . . . I didn\u2019t know I wasn\u2019t supposed to tell.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s not why I was unhappy. It doesn\u2019t matter to me whether or not he knows. What matters to me\u2014what worries me\u2014is that he\u2019s so interested. The only reason I can come up with as to why Carmine would confront me is if he\u2019s contemplating doing something that would be affected by your chip. And the only scenario that makes sense is my son taking you on the run.\u201d</p><p>She froze as Dr. DeMarco opened a program on his laptop. \u201cI\u2019m not going to run away, sir.\u201d</p><p>He held his hand up to silence her before punching a few numbers into the program. A map popped up, a red dot flashing in the center of it. \u201cThe problem is you\u2019ve been around some of the most dangerous men in the country. Because of that, you\u2019re desensitized to moderately harmful situations. I love my son, but he\u2019s volatile. I was the same way at his age, and I know what results from that. I\u2019m not a horrible man. I have a heart, and I\u2019ve been trying to let nature take its course, hoping everything would fix itself, but Carmine\u2019s growing impatient. He\u2019s digging in deep.\u201d</p><p>He pointed at the dot on the screen. \u201cThat\u2019s you. No matter where you go, all I have to do is open this program, punch in the code, and it\u2019ll give me your location. Running is only going to get someone hurt, and I can\u2019t let that happen. I\u2019d try to explain it to Carmine, but he\u2019d want answers I can\u2019t give him\u2014answers he\u2019s better off never hearing. So instead, I\u2019m telling you. If you go on the lam with my son, I\u2019ll track you down and kill you. I don\u2019t want to, but I can\u2019t sacrifice him. And if you two are stupid enough to try to disappear, Carmine will end up hurt at the end.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, frightened. The last thing she wanted was for Carmine to suffer.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like keeping secrets from my son, but his safety comes first. Because these secrets? They revolve around you.\u201d</p> <p>He turned off the laptop and returned it to the bag before sitting back down in his chair. Haven remained quiet, trying to absorb what he\u2019d said. Too many people had been hurt because of her. Carmine couldn\u2019t be one of them. She couldn\u2019t let that happen.</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s a lot to take in,\u201d Dr. DeMarco said. \u201cI\u2019m walking a fine line trying to distance my son from this lifestyle. When I vowed my life to the organization, I swore they would always come first. Little did I know, years later, they\u2019d expect me to hand over my son. Sal views Carmine as the Principe, a Mafia prince, and if he discovers I spoke out against them, he\u2019ll see me as a traitor. Do you know what the punishment for treachery is in my world? What happens to people when they forget their place?\u201d</p><p>She flinched at his choice of words. \u201cDeath.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you see the predicament I\u2019m in. You\u2019re helping my son in ways I\u2019ve failed him, but you need to realize I\u2019m trying to help him, too. I\u2019m saving him from something he doesn\u2019t realize he needs to be saved from. I just haven\u2019t found a way out of this without somebody getting hurt, a way where someone doesn\u2019t have to be sacrificed.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed his pen again and sorted through papers, subject closed. Haven watched him for a moment before picking up the book from the floor.</p><p>Before Haven knew it, the door behind her flew open, and Dr. DeMarco groaned. \u201cHow many times do we have to go through this, Carmine Marcello, before you stop entering rooms without permission?\u201d</p><p>Haven sat still, staring straight ahead at the desk, her skin prickling as Carmine plopped down in the chair beside her. \u201cI had permission. You told me to be here.\u201d</p><p>Dr. DeMarco shook his head. \u201cGive me your car keys.\u201d</p> <p>Carmine tensed. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it with you kids acting ignorant? Give me your keys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis shit again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSon . . .\u201d</p><p>Carmine pulled out his keys and threw them on his father\u2019s desk. They landed on a pile of papers, and Dr. DeMarco picked them up before tossing a different set to Carmine.</p><p>Carmine looked at him with confusion. \u201cWhy are you giving me the keys to the Mercedes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s not yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that have to do with anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured you\u2019d prefer to use someone else\u2019s,\u201d Dr. DeMarco said, \u201cbut if you\u2019d rather her start with the Mazda, by all means take your keys back.\u201d</p><p>Carmine shook his head. \u201cYou aren\u2019t making any fucking sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch your mouth,\u201d Dr. DeMarco said. \u201cIf you\u2019d stop being defensive, you\u2019d see I was telling you to teach the girl how to drive.\u201d</p><p>Carmine\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cYou\u2019re fucking kidding me?\u201d</p><p>Dr. DeMarco groaned. \u201cSometimes I want to knock the shit out of you, son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou realize you\u2019re cursing at me for cursing, right? What kinda role model are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot the type of role model you need. Do what I say, not what I do. You\u2019re too good to follow in my footsteps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo good to be a doctor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what I\u2019m talking about.\u201d</p><p>There was a subtle sadness in Dr. DeMarco\u2019s expression that struck Haven hard. Up until then, she hadn\u2019t been able to sympathize with him. She could understand him now, could see his fears, and the most startling part was they wanted the same thing.</p><p>How was that possible? She couldn\u2019t wrap her mind around it.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t seem so bad,\u201d Carmine said. \u201cLook what it\u2019s gotten you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooks are deceiving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re telling me,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, why are we at the hospital? Implanting shit? Running more tests? Or let me guess\u2014it\u2019s a secret?\u201d</p><p>Dr. DeMarco\u2019s expression flickered with the same aggravation Haven had seen earlier in the day. \u201cYou kids get going. I have patients to see.\u201d</p><p>He walked out, leaving Carmine and Haven alone. They sat quietly for a moment after the door closed before Carmine stood up. \u201cIt scared the hell out of me when I saw you sitting here. I thought I was gonna have to sucker punch him, grab you, and run.\u201d</p><p>His words brought back everything Dr. DeMarco had said. Last week, Carmine told her he\u2019d put her safety above his desires, and now she needed to do the same. She didn\u2019t want him to get hurt, and if that meant giving Dr. DeMarco her loyalty, she\u2019d do it for Carmine.</p><p>Because she\u2019d rather sacrifice herself than him suffer a single moment because of her existence.</p><p>Haven stepped off the curb and paused beside the passenger door to the car. She and Carmine stood there silently for a second before he cleared his throat. \u201cWhy are you over here? You\u2019re driving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow?\u201d</p><p>He jingled the keys in front of her face. \u201cYeah, why not?\u201d</p><p>She took them. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll walk you through it. See the black thing with the big-ass red button on it? Push\u2014\u201d</p><p>Before he could tell her what to push, she hit the red button. The lights flashed as the horn blared. He hit the button to stop it as she smiled sheepishly. This was about to be a disaster if they couldn\u2019t get the doors open without a mistake. \u201cYou see the button with the picture of the opened lock?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPress that motherfucker.\u201d She pressed it, her face lighting up when the car unlocked. He smiled at her expression of pride. \u201cGood. Now get into the car, but don\u2019t touch anything.\u201d</p><p>Haven climbed into the driver\u2019s side as he got in beside her, and Carmine laughed at how far back the seat was. He used the controls to adjust it so she could see over the dash and reach the pedals.</p><p>She put on her seatbelt and raised her eyebrows. \u201cAren\u2019t you going to wear yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I ever wear it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDriving is a piece of cake,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t be that bad at it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right\u2014whatever I say. And I say put the key in.\u201d She stuck it in the ignition. He waited for her to turn it but she didn\u2019t. \u201cAre you going to start the car or what?\u201d</p><p>She glanced at him nervously. \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me to.\u201d</p><p>Haven turned the key and the engine roared to life, but she continued to hold it so it kept grinding. \u201cChrist, let go before you burn the starter up or something!\u201d</p><p>She pulled her hand away. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d he said. \u201cI should\u2019ve told you, but I figured you\u2019d know that much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can count the number of times I\u2019ve been in a car on one hand. I know nothing about them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think about that,\u201d he said. \u201cLook\u2014gas to go, brake to stop. R is reverse to go backward, D is drive to go forward, and P is park . . . to fucking park. Side mirrors, rearview mirror\u2014you look into them to see what\u2019s around. Got it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat about all of the signs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop at the big-ass red octagons that say STOP. The rest aren\u2019t really important. And if the stoplight is red, you stop. If it\u2019s green, you keep going. It\u2019s common sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if it\u2019s yellow?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cUh, if the light\u2019s yellow, speed up to get through it before it turns red. I hate waiting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right then, baby. Put this bitch in reverse and back up.\u201d</p><p>She grabbed the gearshift, putting it in reverse, and took a deep breath before hitting the gas. The car jolted backward as she whipped it around, running up on the sidewalk. She slammed the brake hard, and they stopped abruptly. Carmine clutched his seat. \u201cChrist, I said hit the gas, not floor it. Just press lightly.\u201d</p> <p>She put the car in drive and pressed the gas. They drove through the parking lot to the stop sign, and she hit the brake hard, jolting them again. She stayed there, and he grew impatient, wondering why she wasn\u2019t going anywhere. \u201cIf there\u2019s nothing coming, you can go.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cAnd where am I going, Carmine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that way,\u201d he said, pointing left.</p><p>She looked both ways before turning out onto the road, and Carmine wondered why she hadn\u2019t signaled until he realized he forgot to explain that part. She got into her lane, her hands trembling against the steering wheel. They neared a yellow light, and he expected her to brake. Instead, she slammed the gas and ran straight through it after it turned red.</p><p>\u201cYou ran a fucking red light, Haven! Red means stop!\u201d</p> <p>She cut her eyes at him. \u201cBut you said I should hit the gas when it was yellow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, if you can make it through, which you couldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow was I supposed to know?\u201d</p><p>He had no answer. How was she supposed to know when he hadn\u2019t told her? He felt bad for snapping and glanced through the windshield in enough time to see her heading for a mailbox. \u201cOh, fuck!\u201d</p><p>He grabbed the steering wheel and turned it sharply, the side mirror clipping the mailbox. Haven slammed the brakes, the car skidding to a stop on the side of the road.</p><p>He let go of the wheel. \u201cLet\u2019s see if we can try this again. I\u2019ll shut up and quit distracting you, and you just pay attention to the road.\u201d</p> <p>He was going about it wrong, but he didn\u2019t know how to teach something that came naturally to him. He grabbed his seatbelt and put it on, waving his hand and silently telling her to go.</p><p>Haven pulled back into the lane and hadn\u2019t driven more than a hundred feet when she came to a yield sign. It struck him that he hadn\u2019t told her what it meant, but he was too late. She blew right through it without slowing down.</p><p>Tires screeched, and Haven screamed as she slammed the brakes in a panic, the wrong thing to do if she cut off a car. He told her to hit the gas again, and she clutched the steering wheel tightly as her eyes welled up with tears.</p><p>\u201cPull into the parking lot to the right,\u201d he said as they neared the grocery store. Haven turned, and the car skidded to a crooked stop across some parking spots. A tear slid down Haven\u2019s cheek. Carmine undid his seatbelt and pulled her into his arms. \u201cI made that a lot harder than it should\u2019ve been. I think someone else would be better at teaching you this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do I have to learn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you can get around on your own,\u201d he said. \u201cBesides, it\u2019s a nice skill to have, and one you\u2019ll appreciate when we start over.\u201d</p><p>She pulled from his embrace, a curious expression on her face. \u201cStart over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, a clean slate. No matter what it takes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou really think . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I don\u2019t want anyone else to teach me to drive. I want it to be you.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cYour short-term memory must be fucked if you forgot about the disaster of a teaching job I just did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re learning everything together, remember? Driving should be no different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, then,\u201d he conceded. \u201cLet\u2019s try one more time. First and foremost, when you come to a yellow light, slow the fuck down and stop.\u201d</p><p>27</p><p>Haven stood in the kitchen, surveying the refrigerator as she contemplated what to cook. Dr. DeMarco\u2019s words infiltrated her thoughts, echoing like a song on repeat. She wanted a life with Carmine, but they would need to find a way that didn\u2019t involve running. Was that possible? She wasn\u2019t sure. But against her better judgment, she desperately hoped so.</p><p>Haven yelped when an arm slipped around her waist, so lost in thought she hadn\u2019t heard Carmine approach. \u201cLet\u2019s get drunk tonight, tesoro.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s Friday? Does one need a reason to get drunk? I promise to be a perfect gentleman.\u201d He leaned down, nipping at the nape of her neck with his teeth. \u201cWell, maybe not a perfect gentleman.\u201d</p><p>She laughed but didn\u2019t bother with a response.</p><p>\u201cYou know, we do have air-conditioning,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve had that fridge door open for so long I thought maybe you were trying to cool the kitchen or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking about dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwesome, because I\u2019m starving.\u201d He grabbed a glass from the cabinet. She took it from him, and he looked at her before just shrugging. She grabbed a jar of cherries and a bottle of Coke, making him a drink. He took a sip. \u201cYou\u2019re entirely too good to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can make it up to me later,\u201d she said playfully.</p><p>\u201cIf you wanna go upstairs, I\u2019ll make it up to you right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDinner\u2019s supposed to be ready at seven, which means I only have thirty minutes to throw something together,\u201d she said, pulling some sausage out of the freezer. She stuck it into the microwave to defrost, but Carmine grabbed the sausage and tossed it back into the freezer. \u201cWhat are you doing? You\u2019re going to get me in trouble!\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer, instead pulling out his phone and scrolling through it to make a call. As soon as the line was picked up, he asked them to grab some pizza before coming home. He ended the call with a cocky smirk.</p><p>Haven rolled her eyes. \u201cWe\u2019re still not going upstairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough, but I do wanna get drunk tonight.\u201d</p><p>Haven heard a car approaching and watched the Mazda pull up outside. Dr. DeMarco stepped out with some boxes of pizza. \u201cHe\u2019s home.\u201d</p><p>The front door opened, and Carmine sighed exasperatedly as he let go of her. Dr. DeMarco walked into the kitchen and laid dinner on the counter before glancing at Carmine, a light groan escaping his throat. It was barely audible, and Haven looked at Carmine with uncertainty as he sipped from his cherry Coke.</p><p>The two of them exchanged keys, and Dr. DeMarco headed for the door again before any of them could react. He walked to his car, pausing at the passenger mirror. A long scratch dug into it, noticeable against the shiny black paint. He turned slowly toward the house, his eyes coming to rest on Haven at the window. She worried he would come back inside to somehow punish her, but he climbed into the car and drove away instead.</p><p>Haven turned to Carmine once he was gone. \u201cI think I want to go upstairs now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can do that,\u201d he said, snatching the top box of pizza. \u201cI can still get fucked up, right?\u201d</p><p>She smiled at his expression, his lips turned down in a childish pout. \u201cOf course you can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re gonna drink with me, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s what you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanna do everything with you,\u201d he said. \u201cEven shit we\u2019d be better off not doing together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike driving?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cYes, so let\u2019s get smashed and forget you nearly killed me today trying.\u201d</p><p>Haven brought her cup to her lips and took a sip of the sweet fruity drink. The alcohol taste lingered in the background, not so bad that it hindered the taste. \u201cThis is good. What is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweet-Tart. You know\u2014orange soda, Kool-Aid, and Everclear.\u201d Haven didn\u2019t know, but she liked it anyway. She took another sip as Carmine grabbed his bottle of liquor and took a drink. He was shirtless, and Haven was captivated by the way his stomach muscles grew taut as his body quivered. His calloused hand scratched the scar on his side, his long fingers transfixing Haven.</p><p>He crouched down to look under the bed and dug out the shoeboxes, glancing inside before shoving them back under. He found what he was looking for and pulled out a gray game console and a controller, wordlessly hooking it up to his television.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cClassic Nintendo,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re going to play it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are,\u201d he corrected her, blowing into a game before sliding it in the console. \u201cOr we\u2019re certainly going to try.\u201d</p><p>He turned it on. The game started right away as he sat on the floor, stretching out his legs and patting the space between them. She sat down between his legs, and he held the controller in front of her to explain the buttons. She watched as he navigated the first board.</p><p>\u201cMario\u2019s a rite of passage. You\u2019re nobody until you\u2019ve conquered it.\u201d His tone was serious, yet youthful and innocent. It made her smile. \u201cHere, finish this part.\u201d</p><p>She took the controller. \u201cBut what if I kill him? He can die, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe comes back to life. It\u2019s not like we\u2019ll have to plan a funeral.\u201d</p><p>It took her three tries to get the coordination to jump him over things. Carmine grabbed their drinks and sat back down, pulling her body against his chest.</p><p>The next few hours passed as they fell into a cycle. She\u2019d kill the character, and Carmine would complete a level so she could try the next one. Haven could feel the alcohol in her system, her limbs tingly and head foggy. She found it nice, the two of them doing something so childish and carefree. He was giving her parts of a life she\u2019d missed out on.</p><p>She was playing a board with a bunch of turtles when Carmine nuzzled into her neck. Distracted, she ran the character right off a ledge and tossed the controller down in frustration.</p><p>\u201cDoes my drinking bother you?\u201d Carmine asked, taking a swig from the bottle of vodka.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t drink enough for it to,\u201d she said. \u201cYou aren\u2019t a mean drunk like Master Michael.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to kill that guy,\u201d Carmine said. \u201cYou don\u2019t know how bad I want him to suffer.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cYou can\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? You can\u2019t seriously care about him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I do care about you. I don\u2019t want you to hurt people. I don\u2019t want you to be a killer.\u201d</p><p>Carmine pulled her back to him tighter, kissing the top of her head. \u201cYou know, I never knew what I wanted out of life. Going to Chicago always made the most sense, but now that I have you in my life, I\u2019m starting to see it differently. What you want matters, so if you don\u2019t want me to do that shit, then I have to really think about it. It\u2019ll be your life, too, and you mean a lot more to me than any of them.\u201d</p><p>She smiled as his words washed through her.</p><p>Carmine took the game apart and put it back into the box.</p><p>\u201cI wondered what was in those,\u201d she said. \u201cI worried it was just more porn.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s where I keep the old me.\u201d</p><p>She sat down on his bed with her drink as he pulled out a small box, digging through it briefly before pulling out a black picture frame. She took it from him carefully, her gaze resting upon a photo of a woman with bright red hair and eyes the same color as Carmine\u2019s.</p><p>Haven couldn\u2019t breathe. It was the face she had seen repeatedly in her dreams, the angel in white that glowed in the sunlight. Emotion ripped through her, her voice a broken whisper. \u201cShe\u2019s an angel.\u201d</p><p>Carmine took the frame from her, but instead of placing it back into the box, he set it on his desk. \u201cShe is,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cNow, anyway.\u201d</p> <p>Dreams filtered into Haven\u2019s sleep that night. It was a dark, cloudless night, the glow of the moon illuminating the scene in her mind. She was back in Blackburn again, a fresh-faced little girl with nappy hair, trying to squeeze by to see out of the stables. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on, Mama?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing that concerns you, baby girl,\u201d her mama said quietly as she tried to shoo Haven away. \u201cGo lie down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m not tired,\u201d Haven argued. \u201cPlease, Mama? I want to see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing\u2019s happening,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s all over.\u201d</p><p>Haven gave up on trying to go around, instead getting on the ground and scurrying between her legs. She could faintly make out the outline of a car with the trunk open. On the ground beside it, motionless, lay a person. \u201cIt\u2019s Miss Martha!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHush,\u201d her mama said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want them to hear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, Mama.\u201d Haven tried to whisper, but she couldn\u2019t help herself. She watched as Miss Martha was placed into the trunk, her eyes closed like she was sleeping. \u201cWhere\u2019s Miss Martha going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAway from here,\u201d her mama answered.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s away from here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lot,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a whole world out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Miss Martha going out there to the world?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, Miss Martha\u2019s gone to Heaven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s Heaven?\u201d</p><p>Her mama sighed. \u201cHeaven\u2019s the greatest place you can imagine. People don\u2019t hurt anymore when they go to Heaven. There\u2019s peace there. It\u2019s beautiful. Everyone\u2019s beautiful.\u201d</p><p>Haven smiled excitedly. \u201cWill I get to go to Heaven?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cSomeday an angel will come to take you away.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly the darkness erupted in blinding light. Haven shielded her eyes. She could feel the sun burning her as she ran, air fanning her sweaty skin. She pretended to fly, like Miss Martha did to Heaven the night before, and slammed into something in her path.</p><p>Falling to the ground, she could barely make out the form in the blinding light. She was confused until a soft voice shattered the silence. \u201cYou\u2019re awfully dirty, little one.\u201d</p><p>The blindness cleared as the form knelt down to look at her. Sheer beauty, love, and compassion. Up until then, Haven hadn\u2019t seen an angel, but she was sure one had come.</p> <p>28</p><p>The room was encased in bright light when Carmine woke up. His head pounded, his eyes burned. He blinked a few times as he sat up, realizing he was alone.</p><p>Stretching, he popped two Tylenol to squelch the hangover before strolling out of the room. As soon as he reached the second floor, his footsteps wavered when Haven stepped into the hallway with his father. Her eyes met his the same time Vincent noticed him. \u201cDo you need laundry done again?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo days in a row you\u2019ve walked around with barely any clothes on.\u201d</p><p>He looked down at himself. \u201cMy, uh . . . goods are covered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m glad at least that much sank in over the years.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cWhat, you think you\u2019re too young to be a grandfather?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs a matter of fact, yes,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m only forty-one. But frankly, I\u2019m just as worried about you picking up something as I am about you impregnating someone. For a while, every time you said the words, \u2018what\u2019s this?\u2019 I feared you would expose yourself to show me something suspicious.\u201d</p><p>Carmine laughed. \u201cWell, thanks for the concern, but I assure you my dick\u2019s in fantastic shape.\u201d</p><p>Vincent shook his head as he glanced at Haven. \u201cYou\u2019re excused, child. I\u2019m sure you have things to attend to.\u201d</p><p>She practically bolted for the steps as Vincent turned back to Carmine. \u201cGo get dressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? It\u2019s not like I\u2019m indecent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say you were indecent, but I have a free day, so I thought we\u2019d go shooting like old times.\u201d</p><p>He gaped at him. \u201cVincent DeMarco cleared his schedule to spend time with little ol\u2019 me?\u201d</p><p>Vincent sighed. \u201cGo before I change my mind.\u201d</p><p>Chuckling, Carmine headed upstairs and threw on some clothes. He was in the bathroom brushing his teeth when Haven walked in. \u201cAre you and Dr. DeMarco going away?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, rinsing out his mouth. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna go play with our guns.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be safe, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, he\u2019s not going to shoot me or anything,\u201d he said. \u201cI tested him a few times, and he even pointed a gun at me once, but he couldn\u2019t pull the trigger.\u201d</p><p>Instead of making her feel better, her panicked expression only grew. \u201cHe pointed a gun at you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelax, he\u2019s probably pointed a gun at everyone at some point,\u201d he said as he finished getting ready. \u201cYou gonna miss me, tesoro?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always miss you when you aren\u2019t here.\u201d</p><p>He put on his coat. \u201cGive it a few more months and you\u2019ll be tired of my ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat to hear, but what\u2019s that shit they say? Absence makes the heart grow fonder? Me leaving means you\u2019ll love me more when I get back.\u201d</p><p>The outdoor firing range was a few miles outside of town in the Swannanoa Valley. The field, about four hundred yards in length, had a covered pavilion with various-sized targets. They\u2019d visited it a few times during the years but hadn\u2019t been back since the incident with Nicholas . . . since Carmine went away.</p><p>Carmine had been a decent shot since he was a kid, but Vincent\u2019s aim was impeccable, his hand as steady as a professional marksman\u2019s. His bullet ripped straight through the bull\u2019s-eye effortlessly.</p><p>Vincent reloaded his M1 Garand after expelling all the rounds and held it out to Carmine. \u201cDo you want to try the rifle?\u201d</p><p>Carmine took it and hesitated before handing his pistol to his father. Aiming, Carmine fired once and smirked when it hit the target.</p><p>\u201cThat was luck,\u201d Vincent said, loading the pistol and firing it. He hit the farthest target, unloading the rounds into it.</p><p>\u201cFucking show-off,\u201d Carmine said, taking another shot and hitting the target again. \u201cSee, that wasn\u2019t luck. That was skill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not so bad,\u201d Vincent conceded. \u201cNicholas can attest to that.\u201d</p><p>Carmine rolled his eyes as his father exchanged weapons with him again. He shot at the target, the atmosphere thick with unspoken words. Vincent unceremoniously fired off a few more rounds before lowering his weapon and staring off into space. Carmine realized it then . . . this wasn\u2019t just a casual shooting trip. This wasn\u2019t just father/son bonding time. There was something on Vincent\u2019s mind, something that would be talked about before Carmine would be allowed to go back home.</p><p>If Carmine would be allowed to go back home.</p><p>\u201cIs that what you wanna talk about?\u201d Carmine said, knowing he\u2019d have to crack first. \u201cNicholas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Vincent said. \u201cUnless he\u2019s the reason you\u2019ve been in a good mood lately.\u201d</p><p>Carmine stared at his father as those words sank in. He knew.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t help it,\u201d Carmine said, the stress making his voice quiver. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I set out for this to happen. It just . . . did.\u201d</p><p>Vincent remained silent, his lack of response grating on Carmine\u2019s nerves. \u201cCome on, I know you have an opinion\u2014no need to hold back. I can take it. Tell me how fucking disgusted you are that your son would go as low as to fall for a damn sla\u2014\u201d He faltered, unable to finish the word.</p><p>\u201cWhether or not you say it doesn\u2019t change anything,\u201d Vincent said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make the girl more or less of one.\u201d</p><p>Carmine waited for something more. \u201cIs that all you have to say? I said I can take it. Tell me it\u2019s wrong, that it\u2019ll never work because people like us don\u2019t belong together. Tell me she\u2019s not good enough for me. Tell me she could never love me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what you want to hear?\u201d</p><p>He narrowed his eyes. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Vincent casually glanced at his watch like he was unaffected by the conversation. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we get some lunch?\u201d</p><p>Carmine cocked an eyebrow. \u201cIt would be easier to kill me here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKill you? What kind of person do you take me for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, fuck. I thought you might be the kinda person to hurt an innocent girl. Good to know I was wrong about that shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a man who makes mistakes, a man who doesn\u2019t expect to be forgiven for them, but a man who does expect his children to be respectful,\u201d he said sharply. \u201cIf you want to talk this out using our anger, we can, but I hoped we could discuss it like adults.\u201d</p><p>Carmine hesitated. \u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, are you going to apologize for throwing that in my face?\u201d</p><p>Carmine scoffed. \u201cI\u2019ll apologize for saying it when you apologize for doing it.\u201d</p><p>Vincent and Carmine were seated as soon as they reached the restaurant and both ordered the first thing on the menu. After the waiter brought their food, Vincent turned to his son. \u201cI want you to listen carefully, Carmine. What the two of you have is harmless right now, but I don\u2019t want to hear about it. You may care for the girl, but she isn\u2019t yours. You\u2019re probably going to hate me for saying this, but I\u2019m in control. The first time she neglects what I tell her, I\u2019ll put a stop to it all.\u201d</p><p>Carmine clenched his jaw as his anger boiled over, and Vincent held his hand up to stop the impending explosion. \u201cI\u2019m not going to harm her, but I\u2019ll send her away if you force my hand. I\u2019m not giving you my blessing, but I\u2019m not forbidding it either. I\u2019m smart enough to pick and choose my battles, and I have more important ones to fight right now.\u201d</p><p>He stared at his father. \u201cFair enough.\u201d</p><p>Vincent turned his attention to his food. \u201cI just wonder if you know what you\u2019re getting into.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m kinda sorta hoping the asshole who owns her won\u2019t own her forever.\u201d</p><p>Vincent\u2019s eyes snapped in his direction. \u201cThat\u2019s a nice piece of information to have, but it wasn\u2019t what I was talking about. Why do you think I asked you to teach her to drive, Carmine? Why I asked you to take her grocery shopping?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTo try to break us apart.\u201d</p><p>The answer irritated Vincent, and he dropped his fork. \u201cHave you not been listening? You think I get off on toying with others? Do you honestly think your mother would\u2019ve married me had I been that horrible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I have no idea what was going on in Mom\u2019s head, but I\u2019m sure she wouldn\u2019t be happy about what you\u2019re doing with Haven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were young when she died, and frankly, your view is skewed. I\u2019ve done a lot over the years that would disappoint your mother, but buying the girl isn\u2019t one of them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBuying her? You think my mom would be okay with that? You\u2019re sick!\u201d</p><p>Vincent slammed his fist against the table. \u201cWho are you to talk to me like that? Look how you treat everyone!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd whose fucking fault is that, huh?\u201d Carmine pushed his chair back as he stood. \u201cWhose fault is it I\u2019m fucked up? Whose fault is it I had to watch her die?\u201d</p><p>Vincent glared at him. \u201cNot mine.\u201d</p><p>A voice cleared beside them as the manager approached. Others stared, disturbed by the commotion. Vincent pulled some cash from his wallet, throwing it down on the table before walking out.</p> <p>Not a word was spoken during the drive. When they reached the house, Carmine tried to get out, but Vincent stopped him.</p><p>\u201cI had you do it so you\u2019d see what you were getting into. She\u2019s been cut off from everything, Carmine. In the confines of the house, maybe things are great, but that\u2019s not the real world. On the off chance you get to be together, I figured it was better if you had experience dealing with that part of her. It\u2019s going to be there every step of the way, because when you\u2019re raised like she was, you don\u2019t have the know-how to live any other way. I tried to help you, not hurt you.\u201d</p><p>Carmine opened his mouth to speak, but his father continued before he could. \u201cYou think your mother would be disappointed I brought her into this house? I think you\u2019re wrong. Would she like it? No. I don\u2019t even like it. But I think your mother would\u2019ve been disappointed had I thrown the child into the world blindly. Society would\u2019ve eaten her alive. Probably still will.\u201d</p><p>Carmine had been focused on everything his father was doing wrong and never considered what might be helping Haven.</p><p>\u201cShe needs a semblance of her normal before she can be introduced to ours,\u201d Vincent continued. \u201cYou love her? Fine, love her. But don\u2019t contradict me. This isn\u2019t fun, Carmine. I\u2019m not enjoying this, but I\u2019m doing it and that should be enough to earn your respect. You have to stop acting like you\u2019re powerful and wise, because you\u2019re neither. You need to grasp that, son, or I\u2019m going to lose you like I lost your mother.\u201d</p><p>Vincent got out, slamming the door so hard the windows vibrated.</p> <p>Haven lay in the middle of Carmine\u2019s bed, sprawled out on her back when he entered. He took off his coat and shoes before lying down beside her. Haven\u2019s eyes fluttered open. She blinked a few times, smiling when they made eye contact.</p><p>\u201cLa mia bella ragazza,\u201d he said. \u201cNapping in the afternoon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ran out of stuff to do,\u201d she said. \u201cEverything\u2019s clean.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cA nap actually sounds good right now.\u201d</p><p>She eyed him curiously. \u201cBad day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was confusing, but I wouldn\u2019t call it bad,\u201d he said. \u201cAny day that includes lying in bed with you, tesoro, can\u2019t be bad.\u201d</p><p>She ran her fingertips across his lips. \u201cI missed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMi sei mancata,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s \u2018I missed you\u2019 in Italian.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, mi sei mancata, too.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cI\u2019m a guy, so you say, mancato. You know, with an o and not an a.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMi sei mancato,\u201d she repeated.</p><p>\u201cThere you go! Watch out, look at my girl getting bilingual.\u201d</p><p>Haven sat back on her knees, humming to herself as she surveyed the sparkling kitchen floor. She\u2019d been scrubbing it for more than an hour, removing the black scuff marks from the marble tile. Dr. DeMarco never spoke to her about cleaning. The rare occasions she forgot to do something, he overlooked it. Sometimes she felt like she was living in another universe with how drastically her life had changed. She never imagined living an existence where she could throw down the broom and put the laundry on hold to catch a television program in the middle of the afternoon.</p><p>A lot of it happened without her realizing it. Before she had come to the DeMarco house, she was constantly focused on tasks to stay out of trouble, but now she thought about herself more.</p><p>And that was something she had never been allowed to do before.</p><p>She stood, catching a glimpse of something when she turned around. Dr. DeMarco stood in the doorway, watching her silently. It was noon, and she hadn\u2019t realized someone was home. \u201cAre you hungry, sir?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cYou can make some lunch, dolcezza. We\u2019ll watch TV while we eat.\u201d</p><p>She blinked a few times after he walked out. We?</p><p>After making some chicken salad sandwiches and distractedly throwing together two cherry Cokes, Haven headed into the family room. Dr. DeMarco lounged in a chair with his legs stretched out in front of him, his smile falling when he took his lunch.</p><p>She sat down on the couch and picked at her sandwich as he took a sip of his drink. \u201cCan I ask you something, child?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>He pulled a cherry out of his soda. \u201cDid you make these on your own, or did my son ask you to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI made it on my own. I wanted to be nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInteresting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs something wrong with that?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, I was just curious,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m curious about a lot, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike, how did you know to use the special cleaner on my windows?\u201d</p><p>Her brow furrowed. \u201cIt was written on the bottle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re admitting you could read back then?\u201d</p><p>Her blatant mistake stunned her. She nodded, afraid to speak.</p><p>\u201cI already knew it at the time, but I was surprised you\u2019d slip up on your first day. You aren\u2019t as slick as you think you are.\u201d</p><p>Queasiness overtook her. She set her sandwich down. \u201cHow did you know I could read?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI discovered it years ago on a trip to Blackburn. You had a book. Had I not known, though, you would\u2019ve given yourself away anyway. The moment your illiteracy was mentioned, you looked left. That\u2019s your tell. When you\u2019re hiding something, you look to the left.\u201d</p><p>Haven said nothing, forcing herself to look straight ahead.</p><p>29</p><p>Carmine paced the foyer, the sound of his feet against the wooden floor echoing through the downstairs. The sun hadn\u2019t risen and he already couldn\u2019t stand still.</p><p>After what seemed like another hour, although only a few minutes had passed, a car pulled up outside. He swung open the front door so forcefully he was surprised he didn\u2019t rip it from the hinges. \u201cYou\u2019re late.\u201d</p><p>Dia pushed him out of the way to step in the house. \u201cYou told me six. It\u2019s five forty-five.\u201d</p><p>His brow furrowed. \u201cIt\u2019s not six yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not.\u201d She handed him a piece of paper. \u201cRelax, it\u2019s going to go fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure? I mean, it\u2019s enough, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Dia raised her eyebrows, her expression causing his foolish panic to surge. \u201cChrist, it\u2019s too much. I\u2019m going overboard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s going to love it, Carmine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never done any of this before,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. It\u2019s sweet of you. I\u2019m more than happy to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll get some cash in town and pay you for your freelancing.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cNo need to. This one\u2019s on me. I\u2019m looking forward to hanging out with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo shit? You actually wanna socialize with a girl in my life?\u201d</p><p>Dia rolled her eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s not my fault you used to only bring Moanin\u2019 Lisa around.\u201d</p><p>Haven picked at her cheese and mushroom omelet, listening as Dia ranted about school as they sat in a booth at Crossroads Diner, a small restaurant in the center of town. Dia had woken her up an hour before and asked Haven to have breakfast with her. She had resisted, afraid to leave the house without permission, but Dominic called Dr. DeMarco to ensure it was okay. She didn\u2019t know why she was there, but she was grateful someone wanted to spend time with her.</p><p>Even if that person was still a mystery to Haven.</p><p>After Dia finished her pancakes, she excused herself to the restroom. Haven grew nervous as she disappeared. Being in public by herself, surrounded by strangers, put her on edge.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s a beauty like you doing eating alone?\u201d</p><p>She grew rigid as Nicholas slid into the booth across from her. \u201cI\u2019m with Dia. She went . . . somewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool, it\u2019ll be nice to see her,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, I have a question for you.\u201d</p><p>She gazed at him apprehensively. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He reached into his coat pocket and pulled out a small pink box of candy hearts, dumping a few of them in his hand. \u201cWhat do you call a vampire\u2019s sweetheart?\u201d</p><p>She smiled. Another joke. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>He popped a piece of candy in his mouth. \u201cA ghoulfriend. Get it? Like girlfriend but a ghoul?\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, not seeing what was funny about that.</p><p>Dia returned and slid into the booth beside Nicholas. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cStopped by for some breakfast on my way to the station. I have community service with the police chief.\u201d</p><p>Dia\u2019s brow furrowed. \u201cShouldn\u2019t you be in school, though?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooks who\u2019s talking\u2014shouldn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI took the day off,\u201d she said. \u201cHaven and I are getting her ready for her date.\u201d</p><p>Date? The word caught Haven off guard. Nicholas looked just as surprised. \u201cDate? With who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith her boyfriend,\u201d Dia said when Haven remained quiet. \u201cYou know\u2014Carmine.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas\u2019s expression fell. \u201cDeMarco?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat other Carmine is there?\u201d Dia asked. \u201cAnd don\u2019t be so shocked. He\u2019s not the same person you knew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarmine will never change.\u201d Nicholas\u2019s voice was scathing. \u201cHe might pull the wool over your eyes, but I\u2019m not charmed by him like everyone else. Everyone in this ridiculous town still thinks the sun rises and sets on that guy, that he can do no wrong. It\u2019s bizarre.\u201d He paused, fiddling with his candy. \u201cI have to go.\u201d</p><p>Dia scooted out of the booth to let him pass. He put a piece of candy down on the table in front of Haven before stalking away, shoving the door open and leaving the diner without eating.</p><p>Haven glanced down at the orange candy heart in front of her, reading the words Talk 2 Me faintly written on it in pink. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Carmine paced the foyer again, dressed in a black suit and nervously twirling a red rose. Ever since he had told Dia about his plans, she had been calling it Operation Cinderella, although he thought it was more like Operation Please-Don\u2019t-Fuck-This-One-Up. The closest he got to being Prince Charming was being a Principe della Mafia, but there was nothing remotely romantic about that.</p><p>His mind ran through all the potential catastrophes as he waited, already preparing for the worst. He might say something wrong and offend her. She might be disappointed or overwhelmed by it all. The picnic would be a disaster, with food poisoning or invading ants. If none of that happened, it would storm, even though the weatherman assured a clear night.</p><p>Earthquake. Tornado. Tsunami. Monsoon. Hurricane. Flood. Hail. Blizzard. He didn\u2019t know if half were possible, but he imagined them all happening at once.</p><p>Eventually the clunky hunk of junk Dia called a car pulled up outside. His heart pounded hard. It was only Haven, he reminded himself. It was the girl who, somehow, saw him at his worst and still managed to love him.</p> <p>The door opened and Haven stepped in. She fidgeted in a white dress, a tiny bit of makeup on her face, her wavy hair tamed and pulled back. \u201cBuon San Valentino,\u201d he said, holding out the flower. \u201cHappy Valentine\u2019s Day.\u201d</p><p>Smiling sheepishly, she took the flower from him.</p><p>Carmine turned off the highway when they made it to Black Mountain, driving straight to the art center on Cherry Street. The sign above the main entrance of the gray building announced what it was, but as Carmine helped Haven out of the car, all he saw in her expression was confusion.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a gallery,\u201d he explained, not knowing if she\u2019d understand.</p><p>\u201cLike a museum?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, like that.\u201d</p><p>Excitement flared in her eyes, and he knew then he had made the right choice. He took her hand to lead her inside. The place was dim, only a subtle glow of light throughout the building, shining above the scattered exhibits. \u201cCome on, tesoro.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t move. \u201cDon\u2019t you have to pay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He hadn\u2019t expected her to ask that. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to pay to look at the art.\u201d</p><p>He stood there, apprehensive about what she thought. Now he started to feel bad bringing her somewhere that didn\u2019t cost him a dime.</p><p>\u201cThis place is really free?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He never thought about it before. \u201cEducational reasons, I guess. Artists are kinda like musicians and work more for pleasure than money.\u201d</p><p>He had no idea if he was right or not, but it sounded good.</p><p>They walked around, pausing every few feet to check out exhibits\u2014carvings and pottery, sculptures and paintings, drawings and photography. It wasn\u2019t the usual thing he would find interesting, but anything was enjoyable with Haven around. She glowed the entire time, and he just stood back, listening with amazement as she analyzed and dissected the art.</p><p>\u201cYou need to go to college,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re too damn smart not to.\u201d</p><p>She narrowed her eyes. \u201cIs it appropriate to curse in a gallery?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cFuck if I know.\u201d</p> <p>She shook her head. \u201cDo you really think I could go to school?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I do. And you know I could help you, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you could try,\u201d she said playfully. \u201cWhether or not it works is another matter.\u201d</p><p>They went through the rest of the gallery, chatting casually and holding hands. Toward the end of their tour, Haven paused in front of a pencil drawing, a figure of a woman from the back with a vibrantly colored sphere hovering in the air beside her. Haven was transfixed by it, a smile gracing her lips as she reached out to trace the outline of the drawing. \u201cI like this one. It reminds me of myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, the girl . . . she\u2019s stuck in a life where everything\u2019s bland and hopeless, but then this beautiful thing comes along and brings color into her world. Color she never expected to see.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her, stunned, before turning back to the drawing. He had no idea how she had gotten something so deep from a pencil sketch. \u201cYou know, maybe we\u2019ll see your work in a place like this someday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019m that good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I do.\u201d</p><p>Carmine turned on a side road that weaved through the mountain, driving until the small cabin came into view. It was just one room, a bed and a fireplace, with a small bathroom built in. He parked the car in front as the sun peeked out from behind the clouds, casting light along the meadow surrounding it. Tucked in among the trees were some deer, and Carmine stared at them as one took a few steps in his direction, feeling like he\u2019d been sucked into a Disney movie.</p><p>If one started talking, he was fucking running.</p><p>\u201cWhat is this place?\u201d Haven asked as they climbed out of the car.</p><p>He pulled the key from his pocket. \u201cHome for the next twenty-four hours. I rented it.\u201d</p><p>She eyed him skeptically. \u201cNo wonder you took me to a free gallery. This must\u2019ve cost a fortune.\u201d</p><p>He laughed as he grabbed a basket of food from the car and spread a blanket out on the grass. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s eat. I think I can still afford to feed you.\u201d</p><p>Haven looked at it with surprise. \u201cA picnic?\u201d</p><p>She sat on the blanket, spreading her legs out in front of her. He sat beside her and pulled out the containers of food. Haven grabbed a grape from one and popped it into her mouth as he took the top off of the tall green bottle. Haven watched him warily as he poured the bubbly drink.</p><p>She took a glass carefully. \u201cIs this alcohol?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid not, tesoro. Sparkling grape juice. We\u2019re going sober tonight.\u201d</p><p>She looked surprised as she took a sip.</p><p>They munched on the food for a while, chatting and laughing. She kicked off her shoes as they talked about trivial things, like TV and weather, before delving into more serious topics. She told him stories from her fucked-up equivalent of a childhood, and in turn, he talked about his mom.</p><p>Carmine reached inside the basket and pulled out two Toblerone bars. \u201cDia said you\u2019re supposed to give chocolate to your sweetheart on Valentine\u2019s Day.\u201d</p><p>Haven opened hers and pulled off a triangle. \u201cI thought Saint Valentine\u2019s Day was just a massacre.\u201d</p><p>He choked. \u201cHow do you know about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeopardy!\u201d</p><p>Saint Valentine\u2019s Day massacre, when La Cosa Nostra in Chicago killed seven Irish associates. Carmine was curious if she realized the connection between his family and those things, but he thought better than to bring it up. The last thing he wanted was to have their night tainted by reminders of the world they\u2019d have to go back to.</p><p>They watched the sunset quietly. It was one of the things he loved about her\u2014she never felt like she had to fill the silence. He gazed at the sky when something wet splat on the center of his forehead. Closing his eyes instinctively, he reached up and prayed he hadn\u2019t been shit on by a bird. He felt another drop after a second and groaned at the same time Haven laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s raining.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. Of course the weatherman wouldn\u2019t know what he was talking about.</p><p>They settled onto the cabin porch as the rain steadily fell, a curtain of water cutting them off from the world. Haven watched it quietly, while Carmine strummed his guitar.</p><p>\u201cWill you play something for me?\u201d she asked. He started to reply, to tell her he was playing something, when she spoke again. \u201cSomething happy, please.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. No more Moonlight Sonata. \u201cUh, sure. I\u2019ll play a song that reminds me of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. It\u2019s a real song,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, like one you hear on the radio or whatever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you sing it too?\u201d</p><p>He stared at her. He could probably rupture eardrums and break sanities with his voice, but he couldn\u2019t deny her. Not when she looked at him that way. \u201cOkay, but this might not be pretty.\u201d</p><p>Her smile grew. Carmine strummed the first few chords of Blue October\u2019s \u201c18th Floor Balcony\u201d before softly singing the lyrics. He could feel her gaze on him, his fingers wavering, but he tried to keep focused so not to mess up. He could tell her all day long that he loved her, but this was cracking his chest open and stepping out of himself fully for her to see.</p><p>He glanced at Haven toward the end of the song, his fingers stilling when he saw tears streaming down her cheeks. Reaching over, he brushed some of them away.</p><p>She let out a shaky breath as she placed her hand on top of his. \u201cCan we go inside?\u201d</p><p>He led her into the cabin for the first time, and she paused right inside the door, surveying the dozens of roses faintly visible in the glow of the room. He scooted around her and turned on some music, scanning through songs when Haven brushed against him. She pulled off her coat and draped it over a chair before grabbing a rose. Bringing it to her nose, she inhaled its sweet scent as she sat on the bed, her bottom lip clamped between her teeth.</p><p>Carmine tossed his suit coat onto the table and lit the fireplace before walking over to her. Her expression made his steps falter. \u201cYou okay, hummingbird?\u201d</p><p>Her voice cracked. \u201cPerfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect, indeed.\u201d</p><p>He cupped her cheek and kissed her as she ran her hands through his hair. She moaned as he pushed her onto her back and leaned over her with his hands on both sides of the bed. He pulled from her mouth to take a breath and nudged her head to the side to kiss her neck.</p><p>\u201cCarmine,\u201d she whispered as he kissed toward her collarbones. \u201cMake love to me.\u201d</p><p>Strong emotions swirled through him\u2014shock and elation, with a ton of fear\u2014as his eyes met hers. He wanted to . . . Christ, did he want to . . . but there was no turning back from that. \u201cHaven . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt feels right,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>He felt it, too. There in that moment, it was just him and her, no one and nothing else. They were all that mattered\u2014two people, desperately in love and wanting to show each other. No master and slave, no class divides. No Principe della Mafia and his sweet forbidden fruit.</p><p>They never really felt that way, but it was hard to ignore the labels. There were reminders everywhere of the people they were supposed to be, the ones they didn\u2019t want to be, but it was different here. Here, they were away from everything threatening to tear them apart. Here, there were no complications, no need to hide or pretend.</p><p>Carmine didn\u2019t respond. No words were necessary. That bitch of a voice inside his head, doubting and nagging, had finally been silenced.</p><p>He gazed at her, absorbing all the love, before leaning down and softly capturing her lips with his. He kissed her tenderly as he placed his hand on her knee, slowly running it up her inner thigh. She squirmed under his touch, a whimper escaping her throat as she ran her hands under his shirt, tingles swimming through him as she caressed his bare skin.</p><p>Pulling away, he crouched down beside the bed and pushed up her dress, watching for any sign of distress. \u201cYou can change your mind at any time, hummingbird.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d she said, her voice trembling as she raised her arms, letting him pull her dress over her head. He was in a stupor as he gazed at her, the contrast between her scarred skin and the dark undergarments striking. The strong, feisty girl suddenly seemed fragile, and he could never live with himself if he somehow broke her.</p><p>She reached over and unbuttoned his top button, but he grabbed her hands. \u201cRelax, okay? Let me worship you.\u201d</p><p>Her lips curved at his words. He unclasped her bra, tossing it on the floor, and gazed at her as he grazed his hand across her breasts. A blush started on her cheeks and trickled the whole way down her body.</p><p>She lay on the bed when he finished undressing her, fisting the comforter. Loud moans bounced off the cabin walls as he caressed every inch of her flesh with his tongue. Her body writhed, her legs vibrating as she melted for him. She smelled sweet like nectar he was desperate to consume. A starving man, craving her like nothing before.</p> <p>She cried out when her body exploded in pleasure, the sight of her pushing Carmine over the edge. He shrugged off his shirt, discarding it with Haven\u2019s clothes, before kissing her deeply. She wrapped her arms around him, her breathing erratic as he unbuckled his pants and dropped them to the floor. \u201cWe can stop\u2014\u201d</p><p>Her voice was a ball of fire. \u201cI don\u2019t want to stop.\u201d</p><p>Relieved, his excitement outshined his fear. Hovering over her, he kissed her jaw and nipped at her neck, his heart thumping hard in his chest at the warmth radiating from her. Her hands on his skin were electric as she ran her fingers lightly over the scar on his side. She tilted her head as he kissed the dip in her throat, his lips moving along her collarbones.</p><p>His nerves flared as he reached between them to grasp himself. \u201cI\u2019ll go slow, okay?\u201d</p><p>She clung to him, her brittle fingernails digging into his back, her body rigid when he pushed inside of her. A whimper escaped her throat as he stilled his movements to give her time to adjust. \u201cTanto gentile e tanto onesta pare la donna mia,\u201d he whispered, the words from Dante\u2019s La Vita Nuova flooding from his lips. \u201cQuand\u2019ella altrui saluta, ch\u2019ogne lingua deven tremando muta, e li occhi no l\u2019ardiscon di guardare.\u201d</p> <p>His voice was breathy from anticipation as he tried to soothe her, her body relaxing more with each word. He moved again and sparks flew through his body at the sensation.</p><p>\u201cThat was beautiful,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThe poem or the penetration?\u201d he asked, not thinking before saying the words. \u201cShit, I shouldn\u2019t have said that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI meant the poem, but the other part\u2019s nice so far too,\u201d she said shyly. \u201cAnd you should\u2019ve said that, because that\u2019s who you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, I\u2019m trying to be tender,\u201d he said. \u201cYou deserve to be romanced.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need romance. I need you.\u201d</p> <p>Her eyes fluttered closed. Electricity coursed through him from where they were connected, goose bumps popping up as shivers ripped down his spine. As he made love to her, he finally felt what that meant. They were experiencing something together, an intensity he\u2019d never felt before. It was all of her, every inch of her body, inside and out, merging with his.</p><p>\u201cOnly you,\u201d she whispered, as if she could read his mind. \u201cIt\u2019ll only ever be you, Carmine.\u201d</p><p>Her words ignited a fire inside of him, stirring up the possessiveness that demanded they belong together, forever, just like this. They moved together deliberately, falling into a perfect rhythm. Her noises grew louder, and he grabbed one of her hands, linking their fingers together as he pressed it into the mattress.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d she said breathlessly.</p><p>A noise escaped his throat involuntarily in response, a rumbling growl as hunger swirled through him. \u201cTi amo. Christ, I love you, Haven.\u201d</p><p>There was an ache in his chest, originating in his heart, the pain of all-consuming, overflowing love, so powerful it took his breath away. He continued to fill her and took her other hand, placing it above her head on the bed. His body weight rested against her as he hitched her knees up. Nuzzling into her neck, he tasted the saltiness of sweat as their bodies slid together smoothly.</p><p>Afterward, when the feelings subsided, she snuggled against him, her hand on his chest over his wildly thumping heart. They lay together, legs entangled, as they relished in the postcoital glow. He wanted to ask if she could feel his heart beating, but he kept his mouth shut, choosing instead to enjoy the silence.</p><p>Just two kids, together and in love. There was still nothing that needed to be said.</p> <p>30</p><p>The weeks that followed their stay in the cabin flew by, half a year having elapsed since Haven had been forced to leave her mama behind. She adapted to the world outside the desert, little things that once intimidated her now a regular part of her life. She still kept up with her work, cooking and cleaning every day, but there was always time left over. She had never had time to do things leisurely, and the more she indulged, the more she couldn\u2019t imagine ever going back.</p><p>Free time, Carmine called it. His choice of words made her laugh.</p><p>Drawing and painting, reading and crafts\u2014her days were a flurry of unrestrained creativity. She had taken some notebooks from Carmine and filled pages with words, scribbling down everything on her mind. It was disjointed, riddled with errors, but it wasn\u2019t meant for others\u2019 eyes. She found it liberating, like a valve had been turned, the pressure inside her releasing. The nightmares came less often after that, like she had chased away the monsters with the power of her words.</p><p>She grew more comfortable being outside the house too. Carmine took her wherever he went, giving her cash so she could count it out and pay. She ordered her own food, picked out her own things, and spoke for herself whenever the opportunity arose.</p><p>Life hadn\u2019t only changed for Haven\u2014it shifted for all of them. Dr. DeMarco spent every weekend in Chicago while Dominic prepared for college, since he would graduate in a few months and head across the country with Tess. Even Dia was graduating, but she was staying close by in Charlotte.</p><p>Haven was in the kitchen early the morning before Easter Sunday, cleaning up breakfast as Carmine leaned against the counter, watching her as usual. \u201cWhat do you wanna do today?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cWhatever you want to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I knew what I wanted to do, do you think I\u2019d bother asking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She laughed. \u201cYou always ask my opinion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, do you have an opinion this time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can hang out here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe spend too much time in this shithole.\u201d He paused, his expression brightening. \u201cSo, what do you wanna do today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you want to do, Carmine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hoped you\u2019d say that.\u201d</p><p>Grabbing her hand, he pulled her to the downstairs office and punched in the code to unlock the door. He stepped inside, but she dug her heels in, refusing to follow. \u201cI\u2019m not supposed to go in there. Dr. DeMarco said some doors stay locked for a reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is locked for a reason, just like I have a code for a reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause my father isn\u2019t always home and sometimes we need shit in here.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, contemplating his words, before hesitantly stepping inside the room. Carmine placed his hand on her hip, kissing the nape of her neck. \u201cSee, that wasn\u2019t scary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the room I\u2019m afraid of,\u201d she muttered. \u201cWhy are we in here, anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna teach you how to use my gun.\u201d</p><p>She gaped at him. \u201cYou\u2019re joking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I look like I\u2019m joking? There\u2019s nothing else to do, and I feel like blowing off some steam. Besides, do you know how sexy you\u2019re gonna be shooting something?\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure. \u201cI don\u2019t think your father would want me to touch a gun after I touched his.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou touched Nunzio\u2019s,\u201d Carmine said, matter-of-factly. \u201cHe didn\u2019t get mad about that, did he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was protecting myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is the same thing. You never know when you might need to shoot to protect yourself.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. So persistent. \u201cOkay, but why are we in here?\u201d</p><p>Carmine pulled the rug out of the way and opened a trapdoor in the floor. \u201cTargets. Ammunition. Safety shit. Depending on your mood, maybe a bulletproof vest for me.\u201d</p><p>She gaped at him. \u201cI\u2019d never shoot you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Not intentionally, anyway.\u201d</p><p>She cautiously walked over to the entrance to the basement, and Carmine held her hand as they headed down the narrow steps. \u201cTerra di contrabbando,\u201d he said when they reached the bottom. \u201cWelcome to the land of contraband.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes swept across the concrete room, taking in the massive crates. \u201cEverything down here is illegal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but it\u2019s all pretty fucking unsavory,\u201d he said. \u201cThe front ones are mainly alcohol.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the ones in the back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, I\u2019ll show you. Just don\u2019t touch anything.\u201d</p><p>She followed behind him, coming to a halt when the guns came into view. Dozens of them hung on the wall in neat rows, arranged meticulously by size. \u201cWhoa.\u201d</p><p>Carmine covered his hand with his shirt as he dug through a box behind her. He tried to hand supplies to Haven, but she wasn\u2019t paying attention as she gaped at the weapons.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I say? My father loves his guns.\u201d Carmine opened a cabinet and pulled out a box of bullets. \u201cBut you already knew that.\u201d</p><p>She tore her eyes away from them. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be afraid of guns, though,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the dumbasses with their fingers on the triggers that you have to worry about. As long as you stay away from them, no problem.\u201d</p><p>She glanced at the weapons again. \u201cWhat else is down here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore guns, a shitload of casino chips, the dungeon . . .\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. Dungeon?</p><p>It took the two of them an hour to reach a wide-open space tucked into the woods, the ground covered in an array of wildflowers, a line of tall pine trees surrounding it like nature had deliberately built a fence. Carmine dropped his backpack to the ground as Haven scanned the clearing, a look of awe on her face.</p><p>After setting up a target near the tree line, he positioned Haven\u2019s body and grabbed his gun, explaining the safety and number of rounds. He told her to keep it steady and use her foresight to focus on the target, blocking out everything else.</p><p>Once she got it, he handed her the earmuffs and safety glasses. Taking a step away, he watched her aim, her hands shaking as she squeezed the trigger. He flinched as she popped off her first round, the recoil and expelled cartridge startling her. She screamed and nearly dropped the gun while he stared at the target\u2014she hadn\u2019t come close.</p><p>He put his arms around her again, holding the pistol with her hands on top of his. They fired off the rest of the rounds that way and she relaxed. After reloading, he handed her the gun and gave her some room. The first shot breezed by the target, closer that time, but her hands still shook. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He ended up reloading twice, not a single bullet hitting its intended spot. She came close, though, her eyes twinkling with excitement every time she squeezed the trigger. He tried to imagine how she felt wielding something so powerful, imagining the adrenaline surging through her veins.</p><p>Hitting the target after the third reload, Haven shouted and turned to Carmine, forgetting to lower the gun in her excitement. Carmine ducked, throwing his hands up protectively as she aimed at his forehead. \u201cWatch what you\u2019re fucking doing!\u201d</p><p>She lowered the gun. \u201cI\u2019m sorry!\u201d</p><p>He dropped his hands. \u201cNever aim a gun at someone unless you\u2019re willing to shoot that motherfucker.\u201d</p> <p>She nodded in understanding and turned away, firing a round that grazed the target. She smiled, trying to hold in her excitement. Sighing, Carmine walked up behind her and placed his hands on her hips. He pulled off the earmuffs and tossed them on the ground before lining her back up to the target. \u201cYou\u2019re doing really good.\u201d</p><p>She aimed with a look of determination on her face. He could feel her body tense in anticipation, her muscles firm and arms vibrating. He placed a light kiss on her earlobe without thinking, and she whimpered. Losing focus, she squeezed the trigger, a round echoing through the trees.</p><p>\u201cOops,\u201d she said as birds squawked in the distance.</p><p>He laughed and nuzzled into her neck. \u201cBetter the birds than me.\u201d</p><p>The walk home was a lot harder than Carmine remembered the walk to the clearing being. By the time the house came into view, the sun had set and he was utterly exhausted. The two of them headed for the stairs, but hadn\u2019t made it to the second floor when there was a knock at the door. Haven continued upstairs as Carmine disabled the alarm, finding Max on the porch. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs your dad home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He\u2019s in Chicago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit, I need to give something to him,\u201d Max said, reaching into his pocket for an envelope.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take it for you,\u201d Carmine said, holding out his hand, not questioning him. He didn\u2019t want to know what type of business Max had with his father. Max dealt drugs to save money for school, which alleviated some of Carmine\u2019s guilt when he bought from him. He felt like he was doing it for a good cause, like participating in a coke-a-thon to send a deserving kid to the Ivy League.</p><p>La Cosa Nostra, though, avoided the drug trade.</p><p>\u201cThanks, man. I told him I\u2019d have it to him, and, well, I don\u2019t want to be late with your father.\u201d</p> <p>Carmine took the envelope and said good-bye to Max before closing the door. He went into the office under the stairs again and took the large painting off the wall, exposing the safe underneath. He pulled out his keys and stuck the small golden one into the lock, punching in the code as he turned it. The safe unlocked, and a folder slipped out as soon as he opened it, papers spilling onto the floor. Bending down to pick them up, the word Antonelli caught Carmine\u2019s eye on one of the papers. He froze, a coldness washing through him when he read genetic testing across the top.</p><p>His mind worked fast as he debated what to do, time ticking away, his opportunity dwindling. Curiosity overrode his logic as he grabbed the test results.</p><p>Besides Haven\u2019s, there were no names, but it indicated a conclusive mtDNA match from somewhere. Written along the side, in his father\u2019s messy scrawl, were the words CODIS partial match confirmed. Carmine kicked himself for not paying more attention in science class.</p><p>He shoved the papers back into the folder and placed the envelope in the safe, locking it all up before heading upstairs.</p><p>Loud noises woke them later that night, doors slamming on the floor below. The bed shifted as Haven sat up, wide-eyed. \u201cWhat was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no fucking clue,\u201d Carmine said, glancing at the clock. Three in the morning. He climbed out of bed when he heard heavy footsteps in the library, heading right for them. Dread hit him when the door flung open, Vincent appearing in the doorway.</p><p>Even in the darkness, his rage was obvious.</p><p>\u201cGo to your room, girl,\u201d he barked, not taking his eyes off Carmine as Haven bolted out of the room. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you? Do you have a death wish?\u201d</p> <p>No matter what answer Carmine gave, he\u2019d be wrong.</p><p>\u201cI thought you were smarter than this. Did you honestly think today was a good idea? You can\u2019t be that dense! And I know you\u2019re up to something, son. I know you, by God, but I\u2019m telling you right now\u2014whatever it is won\u2019t work.\u201d</p><p>Carmine said not a word.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you stepping foot in my office or the basement again. You have no business in there anymore. And I know what you saw, too. What you read. I can\u2019t imagine what ideas are floating around in that head of yours, but don\u2019t dare act on it. Whatever it is, don\u2019t do it.\u201d Vincent paced, muttering to himself. \u201cIf you weren\u2019t turning eighteen soon, I\u2019d send you back to the academy tomorrow. I already have half a mind to get rid of the girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t gonna do a goddamn thing to her,\u201d Carmine said. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna leave her alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do anything I want with her! Have you not been listening to me? You\u2019re going to get yourself killed! You may not care about your life, but I can\u2019t let you throw it away. I\u2019ll do whatever I have to do to make sure that doesn\u2019t happen, even if it means her being collateral damage.\u201d</p><p>Carmine clenched his hands into fists, those words driving him to the brink. \u201cFuck you! I\u2019ll kill you if you hurt her again!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you will,\u201d Vincent said. \u201cIn fact, I don\u2019t doubt it, but at least your mother\u2019s sole will still have his light. She would\u2019ve never wanted you involved in this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t use Mom as an excuse to justify your bullshit! I love Haven! Accept it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t!\u201d Vincent stepped toward him. \u201cYou\u2019re just a child, Carmine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI may be seventeen, but I\u2019m not a kid. I haven\u2019t been a kid since I got shot because of you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re saying. You don\u2019t know the devastation that girl has inflicted on my life! Just look at us! Look what she\u2019s causing!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not causing it, you are! You\u2019re the one who brought us into this life! You paid money for her\u2014for a fucking child\u2014and you wanna blame her for this?\u201d</p><p>Vincent shook his head. \u201cI tried to help her! I\u2019ve done everything I could for that girl, and none of it\u2019s enough. Nothing\u2019s ever enough! It\u2019s impossible! Worthless! You don\u2019t know how much I\u2019ve suffered because of that little bitch!\u201d</p><p>The moment the word escaped his lips, Carmine\u2019s composure slipped. Red flashed before his eyes as he struck, his fist connecting with his father\u2019s mouth. \u201cDon\u2019t call her that!\u201d</p><p>Before Carmine even realized his father had moved, Vincent was on him. He slammed him into the wall, the force of the blow knocking the wind out of Carmine. He gasped for air as his father pinned him against the desk, knocking things on the floor as the two of them scuffled.</p><p>Dominic burst into the room, hearing the commotion, and grabbed his father\u2019s shoulder. It registered with Vincent what he was doing, and he quickly pulled his hands away. Backing up, he swiped his fingers across his bloody mouth. \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you trust me, Carmine? Why couldn\u2019t you let me handle this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you give me a reason to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeeping you safe isn\u2019t a good reason?\u201d</p><p>Carmine didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cMy safety means nothing compared to hers.\u201d</p><p>Standing in the doorway of the bedroom, Haven surveyed the damage from the fight as Carmine grumbled, opening his desk drawer and grabbing a bottle of liquor. He grimaced as he took a drink and kicked the desk drawer closed before plopping down in the chair and staring at the floor in the darkened room.</p><p>Unable to take the tension, Haven busied herself by picking up things that had been knocked over. She plugged in the alarm clock and tried to set it, but she gave up with the numbers still flashing twelve. Grabbing the picture frame from the floor, she winced as a small shard of broken glass stabbed her thumb. Blood oozed from the cut as she set it down on the desk.</p><p>\u201cChrist, you\u2019re bleeding.\u201d</p><p>Carmine tried to grab her hand, but she pulled away. \u201cYou broke the picture frame.\u201d</p><p>He groaned. \u201cSo? Just stop cleaning. None of that shit is important!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is important.\u201d She fought back tears. \u201cIt\u2019s your mama.\u201d</p><p>She continued picking up the rest of the stuff, having no idea what else to do. Frustrated, Carmine snatched the bottle of liquor from the desk and flung it at the wall. It shattered, glass and alcohol spraying everywhere. Haven flinched, closing her eyes as her tears slipped through, flashes of memory striking her as hard as fists. Michael\u2019s anger, the shattered glass, and the revolting stench of spilled liquor.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re worthless,\u201d he had screamed, spitting the words at her. \u201cYou can\u2019t do anything right, girl! You\u2019re the worst thing I ever did!\u201d</p><p>She reopened her eyes, watching the annoyance fade from Carmine\u2019s face. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t be yelling at you. None of this is your fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cI\u2019m tearing your family apart.\u201d</p><p>Carmine knelt beside her, grabbing a notebook and tossing it on his desk. \u201cThis family was torn apart when my mom was killed, so unless you wanna take credit for that, you can drop that bullshit.\u201d</p><p>Haven lay in bed with Carmine later, brushing her fingers along his swollen knuckles as guilt ran rampant through her. No matter what he said, she believed she had caused it.</p><p>She didn\u2019t sleep much, the peace she had found over the weeks tainted as Carmine slipped in and out of consciousness, thrashing around with nightmares.</p><p>In the morning, she headed downstairs in a daze and pulled things out for Easter dinner. The Mercedes wasn\u2019t parked in its spot in the driveway. She wondered if there was even a point in cooking with Dr. DeMarco gone.</p><p>The morning flew by, morphing into afternoon, before eventually shifting into early evening. The boys made their way downstairs, tension lingering in the house, but she was too exhausted to deal with what it meant. She stood in front of the stove, going through the motions like she\u2019d been taught to do, while Carmine sat on the counter, staring at her. Dominic bounded into the room, grabbing one of the deviled eggs she\u2019d made. \u201cYou feeling all right today, Haven?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s on autopilot,\u201d Carmine said, answering for her. \u201cHappy Easter to us all.\u201d</p><p>She said nothing, a faint sound outside drawing her attention. Glancing out the window, she stared at Dr. DeMarco\u2019s car as it came to a stop. Carmine leaped down from the counter and wrapped his arms around her protectively, when the front door opened and Dr. DeMarco headed their way. He paused a foot from them, his voice strained. \u201cLet me see your hand, Carmine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou put too much stress on your fourth and fifth fingers when you hit me. I\u2019ll be surprised if you didn\u2019t fracture them.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFuck you.\u201d</p><p>Dominic sighed exasperatedly. \u201cJust let him look at your hand and get it over with, bro.\u201d</p><p>Carmine stayed still for a moment before pulling his hand from Haven\u2019s hip. Dr. DeMarco\u2019s expression remained blank as he eyed his son\u2019s hand, and Carmine winced a few times as he pressed on his knuckles. \u201cYou\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I said . . .\u201d Carmine pulled his hand away. \u201cFuck you.\u201d</p> <p>Haven carried the food to the table once it was done and planned to go to her room, but Carmine stopped her, pulling out a chair and motioning for her to sit. The tension mounted through dinner. No one wanted to be there, none of them wanting to deal with it, but it couldn\u2019t be avoided anymore. The wheels had been set into motion.</p><p>A fork clanged as Dominic cracked first. \u201cWe have to clear the air. We need to have a sit-down.\u201d</p><p>Dr. DeMarco scoffed. \u201cYou know nothing about sit-downs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, but we\u2019re going to have our own version,\u201d Dominic said. \u201cNo one leaves the table until we get some answers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are some questions I can\u2019t answer,\u201d Dr. DeMarco said.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine,\u201d Dominic said. \u201cIf you can\u2019t answer something, tell us. Plead the fifth\u2014it\u2019ll be good practice. But things can\u2019t keep going like they are, Dad. We used to feel like a family\u2014a dysfunctional-as-hell one, but still a family. And now it\u2019s every man for themselves.\u201d</p><p>Dr. DeMarco stared at his plate. \u201cFine. Family meeting.\u201d</p><p>The word family struck Haven. She jumped to her feet. \u201cMay I be excused, sir?\u201d</p><p>Dr. DeMarco waved her away, while Carmine slammed his hands down on the table. \u201cSit down, Haven. This involves you, too.\u201d</p><p>She froze, having no idea what to do until Dr. DeMarco pointed at her chair. \u201cTake your seat.\u201d</p><p>She sat down, folding her hands in her lap, but wished she had left anyway when Dominic started the conversation. \u201cFirst of all, Dad, what\u2019s your problem with Haven?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy do you think I have a problem with her?\u201d Dr. DeMarco asked.</p><p>Carmine scoffed. \u201cMaybe because you fucking threaten her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalm the hell down,\u201d Dominic said, pointing at his brother. \u201cThere\u2019s no yelling in my sit-downs. Let me handle this.\u201d</p><p>Carmine grumbled under his breath and crossed his arms over his chest.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s better.\u201d Dominic turned to their father. \u201cMaybe because you fucking threaten her?\u201d</p><p>Dr. DeMarco shook his head. \u201cI have nothing against the child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you said . . .\u201d she started before she realized what she was doing. She shut her mouth, nervous she had spoken out.</p><p>\u201cI said what?\u201d Dr. DeMarco raised his eyebrows. \u201cBe out with it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou told those men I wasn\u2019t worth it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, and I won\u2019t take it back. Doesn\u2019t mean I have a problem with you, though.\u201d</p><p>Carmine fidgeted, fighting to remain silent, while Dominic continued with his questions. \u201cSo if you don\u2019t hate her, what\u2019s the big deal about her and Carmine being together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause there are complications they don\u2019t understand,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve told them they can be together for the time being.\u201d</p><p>Carmine couldn\u2019t restrain himself any longer. \u201cCan\u2019t you see how unfair that is? We can be together \u2018for the time being\u2019? What the hell does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means until I figure things out, I can\u2019t give you any guarantees on the future.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat things?\u201d Carmine asked. Dr. DeMarco didn\u2019t answer. \u201cFine, I\u2019ll figure it out myself. Just tell me who she\u2019s related to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. If they find out you know, you\u2019re going to get hurt. I need you to understand that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the big deal?\u201d Dominic asked. \u201cShe has family . . . isn\u2019t that good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not. He\u2019ll expect her to be handed over, and she wouldn\u2019t be safe with him.\u201d</p><p>Haven\u2019s mind furiously tried to work through what he\u2019d said.</p><p>\u201cNo one\u2019s taking her,\u201d Carmine said. \u201cI won\u2019t let it happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I don\u2019t know that? You\u2019ll follow right behind, and I can\u2019t have you both being taken down. I\u2019m trying to find a way out where you walk away from this, but you\u2019re making it difficult.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I know him?\u201d Carmine asked.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t answer that.\u201d</p><p>He laughed dryly. \u201cI\u2019ll take that as a yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMind your own business!\u201d Dr. DeMarco said. \u201cYou have to forget all about the DNA test!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t you?\u201d Dominic asked. \u201cForget about it. Let the information die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause three can keep a secret if two of them are dead. That\u2019s why. People know. You have no idea the dilemma this has put me in, how hard it has made helping her. Carmine has no regard for his own life. He made that clear again last night. Threatening him won\u2019t affect him, but threatening her will. And it\u2019s not an idle threat. If it comes down to it, I\u2019ll choose my blood.\u201d</p><p>Haven\u2019s heart thumped hard in her chest as Carmine snapped. \u201cYou\u2019re stupid if you think I\u2019d just move on with my life if something happened to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you think that\u2014\u201d</p><p>Carmine growled. \u201cDon\u2019t pretend to know my feelings! Stop treating me like a child!\u201d</p><p>Dr. DeMarco slammed his hands down on the table. \u201cThen grow up! I know how you\u2019re feeling, because I felt the same way when I was your age! I know what you\u2019d risk for her, but I can\u2019t let you. I have to at least try for your mother!\u201d</p><p>Carmine\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cMom has nothing to do with this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mother has everything to do with it! She loved her!\u201d</p><p>Carmine blanched at that, his eyes darting to Haven before going right back to his father. His mouth flew open, like words were trying to force themselves out, but there was nothing but silence.</p><p>\u201cYour mother was too na\u00efve,\u201d Dr. DeMarco continued, his voice somber. \u201cShe\u2019d insist there was a way out of this where no one got hurt, but she\u2019d be wrong. Someone\u2019s going to get hurt. I just hope it\u2019s neither of you.\u201d</p><p>The tension returned after the turn in conversation. Carmine\u2019s voice shook when he spoke. \u201cWho did it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho did what?\u201d Dr. DeMarco asked, not bothering to look up from his plate.</p><p>\u201cYou know what. Who killed her? We\u2019re clearing the air here. I wanna know who shot me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTheir names don\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why did they do it?\u201d he asked. \u201cThe least you can do is tell me what caused it all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no point, Carmine. What\u2019s done is done.\u201d</p><p>Carmine laughed dryly. \u201cDon\u2019t give me that. I have a right to know whose fault it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck do you mean you don\u2019t know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean I don\u2019t know who to blame!\u201d Dr. DeMarco said. \u201cYour mother\u2014God, I loved your mother, but she went behind my back and did things she knew she shouldn\u2019t have done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat things?\u201d Carmine asked. \u201cWhy did she do them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did your mother do anything? She wanted to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelp who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter, Carmine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it does,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanna know who was so important she\u2019d risk everything for them. I wanna know who she\u2019d throw her life away for!\u201d</p><p>His anger frightened Haven. Dr. DeMarco stared at his son, his expression blank but gaze intense. Carmine\u2019s enraged expression softened as his brow furrowed, and he broke eye contact. Dropping his head down, he ran both hands through his hair and blinked a few times.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too much like your mother, Carmine,\u201d Dr. DeMarco said quietly. \u201cI can\u2019t let history repeat itself. Not anymore.\u201d</p><p>Carmine pushed his chair back, throwing his napkin down on the table and bolting from the room without waiting to be excused.</p><p>\u201cIs this sit-down adjourned?\u201d Dr. DeMarco asked. \u201cI\u2019d hate to walk out in the middle of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s over,\u201d Dominic said. \u201cIt was a failure, anyway.\u201d</p><p>Dr. DeMarco stood, patting his son on the back. \u201cWe\u2019re walking away from it with our lives intact. We\u2019re not always that lucky in real sit-downs.\u201d</p><p>A flood of emotion rushed through Carmine as he locked himself in his bedroom. Horror. Shock. Love. Longing. Gratitude. Anger. Remorse. He kicked the bed frame as he walked by it, tugging his hair so hard his scalp throbbed. A ton of weight pressed against his chest, crushing him with the force of the truth.</p><p>It was Haven. She was the reason his life had been shattered.</p><p>He tossed things around, trying to release some pressure, his thoughts convoluted as he shifted blame, trying to find logic where none could be found. Everything was supposed to be easy for him, so why did it feel so fucking complicated?</p><p>He snatched the picture frame from his desk and stared at the photograph of his mom, a streak of Haven\u2019s blood smeared on the broken glass. Tears of resentment stung his eyes. Nothing had changed, but everything seemed different.</p><p>He threw the frame down and stepped into the bathroom, his gaze falling on his muddled reflection in the mirror. His bloodshot, sorrowful eyes reminded him of her, and the last thread of control he\u2019d been holding on to snapped.</p><p>His fist connected with the mirror. It cracked, shards of glass flying as he pounded on it in a rage, not slowing down until it was obliterated, his reflection gone from sight. Emotion swirled through him again as he slid down to the floor, drawing his knees up to his chest. His anger gave way to despair as the tears started to fall. He surrendered to it, not having the willpower to fight anymore.</p><p>The anguish took over as he put his head down. He let himself slip under and wallow in the misery of what he\u2019d lost.</p><p>Darkness cloaked the bathroom when Carmine resurfaced. He walked to the sink, glass crunching under his shoes. The cuts on his hand stung as he washed away the blood.</p><p>Grabbing a bottle of vodka from his stash, he went down the stairs, seeing the light on in his father\u2019s office. He didn\u2019t bother to knock before stepping inside, kicking the door closed behind him. Plopping down in the leather chair, Carmine took a drink of the liquor.</p><p>\u201cI never wanted to tell you,\u201d Vincent said. \u201cI thought it would be cruel. Your mother asked me to save her, but Frankie Antonelli wouldn\u2019t let the girl go. So I told her to drop it, but she didn\u2019t. She couldn\u2019t. I realized what she was doing too late. I was too late.\u201d</p><p>It all hit Carmine hard, and he blinked rapidly to ward off the tears. \u201cDid she figure out the secret? Is that why they killed her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was on the right track, had even hired a private investigator, but I don\u2019t think she had enough time to put the pieces together. She would have, though. It was only a matter of time.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd you blame Haven for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not her fault,\u201d Vincent said. \u201cShe was just a child.\u201d</p><p>Carmine laughed bitterly. \u201cYou think I don\u2019t fucking know that? Of course it\u2019s not her fault. Doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t blame her anyway.\u201d</p><p>Vincent sighed. \u201cSometimes we suffer a loss and try to blame a single cause.

I\u2019ve come to grips with it for the most part, which is why I felt it was safe to bring her here. But yes, I do still have moments where I slip back into that mind-set and wish she didn\u2019t exist.\u201d</p><p>Carmine could hear the disgust in his voice. \u201cWas it Frankie who had her killed?\u201d</p><p>Vincent nodded. \u201cA few years ago, Sal told me Frankie panicked about your mother asking questions, said it was because the Antonellis\u2019 son fathered the girl. He didn\u2019t want his family\u2019s dirty little secret to come out. It\u2019s kill or be killed in our world, son.\u201d</p><p>Carmine could feel the vodka burning through his veins. He ran his hand through his hair, cringing at the pain. His father frowned. \u201cYou must\u2019ve been pounding on something hard.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust had a small mishap with a mirror.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should go to the hospital for an X-ray.\u201d</p><p>Carmine held up his bottle of vodka. \u201cI have all the medicine I need right here.\u201d</p><p>He took another swig of it as his father muttered. \u201cI pity your liver, heading straight for cirrhosis at seventeen. It\u2019ll kill you if you keep it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe all gotta die at some point, Dad,\u201d he said. \u201cMay as well go out for something I love.\u201d</p><p>He brought the bottle to his lips for a drink, and as the liquid flowed, it struck him what he\u2019d said. That was exactly what his mom had done.</p> <p>31</p><p>The sound of the bell rang through the brightly lit room. There was a collective shuffling as the students gathered their things. Carmine closed his science book awkwardly with his left hand, his right wrist in a bandage, sprained from the incident with the mirror in his bathroom.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget to study, folks!\u201d the biology teacher, Mr. Landon, called out. \u201cQuiz tomorrow!\u201d</p><p>Carmine grabbed his backpack before strolling to the teacher\u2019s desk. Mr. Landon erased the board and turned, caught off guard to see him. \u201cIs there something I can help you with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wondered if you could explain mtDNA.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Landon pursed his lips. \u201cWe covered that at the beginning of the semester.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but I\u2019m a bit confused.\u201d</p><p>Truthfully, he hadn\u2019t paid a damn bit of attention. Carmine always relied on luck and common sense to pass his classes, and most of the time he had just enough of both to get by.</p> <p>\u201cWell, unlike nuclear DNA, mtDNA isn\u2019t unique to us. We share it with our mothers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo my mtDNA would be the same as my mom\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, just as it\u2019s the same as her mother, and her mother\u2019s mother, and so on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut can men be traced through it? I mean, say mine was tested. Who would it match?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople related to your mother. Whatever your mtDNA, it came directly from the maternal side.\u201d</p><p>Carmine was stunned. He\u2019d naturally assumed the test had something to do with Haven\u2019s father and his connections to the mob, never considering it could deal with Haven\u2019s mom.</p><p>\u201cIs that all you needed?\u201d Mr. Landon asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He hesitated. \u201cActually, no. Do you know anything about GPS?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat specifically do you want to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there a way to disable a signal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, there are ways to block them,\u201d he said. \u201cGPS chips need a line of sight to the satellite tracking them, so any big obstruction will keep the signal from getting out. Also, reflective materials like water or metal can cause the signal to bounce back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it the same for tracking chips in people?\u201d</p><p>Mr. Landon snickered. \u201cThat\u2019s science fiction. Human tracking chips don\u2019t exist.\u201d</p><p>Bullshit. Just because the FDA hadn\u2019t approved them didn\u2019t mean they weren\u2019t out there. \u201cHypothetically speaking. If a person had one implanted under their skin, is there a way they could keep from being found?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey could stay in a windowless room or learn to breathe underwater. Otherwise, it would connect to the satellite as soon as they stepped into the open.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo basically becoming a prisoner or drowning is the only way to disrupt it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d think so, yes. There\u2019s no way to say for certain, though, since it\u2019s completely hypothetical.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>He turned to leave when Mr. Landon called his name. \u201cYour inquisitiveness gives me hope for you, so keep it up.\u201d</p><p>Carmine smiled to himself as he walked out. While his teacher was proud, his father would flip if he knew he\u2019d asked those questions.</p><p>Vincent slowed the car as he neared the tall brick house, swinging a sharp right into the driveway. He parked behind the red convertible and climbed out, locking it and setting an alarm.</p><p>The neighborhood was decent, not too much crime in that part of town. He wasn\u2019t worried about any of the locals, as they\u2019d have to be foolish to step foot onto the property uninvited. Everyone around there was well aware la famiglia controlled the streets, just as they knew Vincent\u2019s position of authority and the power he held. They respected him for it. Most of them didn\u2019t like him, but he didn\u2019t care about their personal feelings.</p><p>For the moment Vincent stepped into the streets, his emotions didn\u2019t exist anymore. He had no compassion, no sympathy, no empathy, and no remorse. He couldn\u2019t. And the longer he spent in Chicago, the colder he grew.</p><p>It was one of those warm spring nights that Maura had always enjoyed, where she could open all the windows and let the breeze blow through. He used to complain about how hot she let the house get. He\u2019d been temperamental then, and many times he wished he could go back and erase his scathing words.</p><p>Del senno di poi son piene le fosse. Hindsight is 20/20.</p><p>He strolled to the front door and rang the doorbell before rolling up the sleeves of his light blue button-up shirt. The sound of high heels echoed inside before the door opened. The woman stood before him, a smile on her shiny red lips. \u201cHello, Vincent. It\u2019s been a while.\u201d</p><p>She moved out of the way to let him pass. He wordlessly made his way to the front room and took a seat on her black leather couch. She joined him, holding a glass of red wine. He took it, bringing the glass to his nose and inhaling, taking in the aroma. Maura always liked red wine.</p><p>\u201cSo, how long are you in town for this time?\u201d she asked, taking a sip of her drink, while he just held his. He didn\u2019t drink anymore, hadn\u2019t for a long time.</p><p>\u201cUntil I\u2019m dismissed.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t na\u00efve to the lifestyle. She\u2019d been born into it, a Principessa della Mafia. She knew he couldn\u2019t talk about what he did, so conversation between them was kept to a minimum\u2014no misleading and certainly no misconceptions.</p><p>\u201cAre you hungry?\u201d she asked. He gazed at her, his eyes roaming her body, admiring her snug black dress and thigh highs. Her skin was tanned, her hair dark brown, her eyes an odd shade of hazel with tiny flecks of green in them. The green reminded him of the eyes he had gazed into every night for years.</p><p>He looked away from her. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>They ate dinner while she talked and finished off the bottle of wine. Vincent just listened and nodded at the right times. Afterward, he strolled to the window and gazed out as she cleaned up, the stars and moon shining brightly above her enclosed backyard.</p><p>The clicking of heels approached, the sound stopping right behind him as her reflection greeted him in the window. She smiled mischievously, running her hands up his back. She rubbed his shoulders, massaging them firmly. \u201cYou\u2019re always tense, Vincent.\u201d</p><p>He let out a soft sigh. \u201cThat\u2019s why I come to you. You know what I need.\u201d</p><p>She hummed in response as she ran her hands under his shirt, her manicured fingernails lightly scraping his skin. Maura never had fingernails, always chewed them down to little stubs\u2014sometimes so much her fingers bled.</p><p>She undid his buttons, her lips pressing lightly against the nape of his neck. Her breath was warm, her kiss sticky from the color on her lips. \u201cI think I know what you need now.\u201d</p><p>Vincent said nothing as he redressed an hour later.</p><p>It was moments like these, when Vincent should feel at ease, that he often felt the full weight of the world he lived in pressing against his chest. If he could go back, he would change so much, but all he could do was go forward and make sure that what had happened to him didn\u2019t happen to Carmine. He could make sure that twenty years from now, his son wasn\u2019t the one fucking nameless women who meant nothing, trying to keep a grip when all he really wanted was to let go.</p><p>The clock on the car\u2019s dash read midnight when Vincent backed out of the driveway and started toward Highway 290. He drove for thirty minutes before he pulled onto the long winding path that cut through the hillside, driving through the front gate: Mount Carmel Cemetery.</p><p>He turned off the car and climbed out, walking through the grass, past the graves of some of those who had lived his life and died. The Capones were buried in this section, dozens of other Mafiosi scattered throughout the cemetery. He\u2019d be there someday too, buried in the plot beside his wife.</p><p>His steps faltered as he spotted the gravestone, his chest constricting. Kneeling in front of it, he ran his hand along the name on the cold marble marker.</p><p>Maura DeMarco</p><p>April 1965\u2013October 1996</p><p>\u201cAma, ridi, sogna\u2014e vai dormire\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy sweet Maura,\u201d he said. \u201cI know it has been months, but I haven\u2019t felt like I deserved to visit you. How disappointed you must be.\u201d</p><p>He sat down in the grass, eyeing the sentence that aligned the bottom. \u201cAma, ridi, sogna\u2014e vai dormire,\u201d he said, his voice a strangled whisper in the darkness. \u201c\u2018Love, laugh, dream, and go to sleep.\u2019 That was how you lived your life, and I\u2019m trying to follow your lead. I got her, you know. I finally got her for you, and you\u2019re not here for it.\u201d</p><p>He laughed cynically as tears slipped from the corner of his eyes. \u201cYou were probably angry at me when I locked her in her room, as upset as you must\u2019ve been that day all those years ago when I . . . I . . .\u201d He trailed off. \u201cYou know what I almost did, what I tried to do that night . . . the night I killed them. I know you were watching, and you were the one who stopped me. Even dead, you\u2019re still saving her. I could imagine you standing there with your forehead wrinkled\u2014how you used to look when you got mad. I hated disappointing you, but what I wouldn\u2019t give to see that face again.\u201d</p><p>He paused, shaking his head. \u201cThe girl\u2019s okay, I guess. We all are for now. I\u2019m trying to figure out how to keep us that way. She\u2019s growing and coming into her own. It reminds me of you, and that\u2019s harder than you could imagine.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He wiped his eyes with the back of his hand, brushing away the tears as he sat quietly, savoring the silence. Seeing her name, something tangible to remind him she had been real, soothed his frazzled nerves, and for the moment, he almost felt at peace.</p><p>After a few minutes, he stood and brushed the grass off of his pants. \u201cI won\u2019t stay gone so long next time. I love you.\u201d</p><p>He walked away, heading across the cemetery to his car. The tears came to a stop, his heart growing numb on the drive back to Chicago.</p><p>By the time he crossed into the city limits, he felt cold again.</p> <p>32</p><p>Haven stood in the doorway to the bedroom, quietly watching Carmine as he did his homework. He sat at his desk with his head in the palm of his left hand, staring intently at a laptop. He hadn\u2019t sensed her presence, or if he did, he chose not to acknowledge her.</p><p>Carmine groaned. \u201cWhat does the Greek alphabet have to do with math?\u201d</p><p>She blurted out the answer. \u201cPi?\u201d</p><p>He jumped at the sound of her voice and swung around. \u201cDid you just ask if I wanted pie?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, Pi is a part of the Greek alphabet, and it\u2019s also a math, uh, thingy.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her for a moment before what she said registered. \u201cWell, thank Alex Trebek for that. You could probably do my damn work and save me a lot of aggravation, you know.\u201d</p><p>She blushed. \u201cBut if I did it, how would you learn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see myself ever needing to know this shit,\u201d he said, shaking his head. \u201cAnyway, is there something you needed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m supposed to go to Dia\u2019s, remember?\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure how he\u2019d forgotten, since it was his idea in the first place. \u201cOh, yeah, right.\u201d He grabbed his keys off his desk. She expected him to stand so they could leave, but instead he held them out to her.</p> <p>She stared at the keys. \u201cAren\u2019t you going to drive me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know how to drive,\u201d he said, jingling them. \u201cI don\u2019t have time to play taxi, tesoro. I have a ton of homework to get done and errands to run.\u201d</p><p>Her brow furrowed. \u201cHow will you run errands if you don\u2019t have your car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going with Dom,\u201d he said. \u201cYou remember how to get to Dia\u2019s, right? It\u2019s a straight shot. I dropped you off there when you got your dress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, yes, but . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd stop by the store on your way home and grab some Coke for me, will you? It\u2019s just the next street over. There should be some cash in the glove box.\u201d</p><p>She gaped at him. \u201cBut . . . your car. I can\u2019t drive it.\u201d</p><p>He sighed exasperatedly. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause I\u2019ve only ever driven Dr. DeMarco\u2019s, and that\u2019s when you were with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMine drives like his does. And if it makes it easier, pretend I\u2019m in the passenger seat. Just curse a few times. It\u2019ll feel like I\u2019m there.\u201d</p><p>He turned around, subject closed.</p><p>It was the middle of May, and today was Durante High School\u2019s prom. Three weeks before Carmine had sprung it on her, casually telling her she needed to pick out a dress. Dia offered to take her shopping a few days later, and Haven got a blue one with dark golden trim.</p><p>The past few weeks had been a confusing time for Haven. There were highs and lows, the changes sometimes so abrupt that it was impossible to brace for it. The anticipation and excitement was always there, brewing underneath the surface, but there was also fear\u2014a fear of the unknown, a fear of the plunges.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t always bad. Carmine lost his temper quite a bit, but there were also moments, such as that one in his bedroom, when he did something uncharacteristic of the boy she\u2019d come to know. He was protective of his car, yet he had handed her the keys without a thought even though she didn\u2019t have a license.</p><p>The Harper family lived in a one-story tan house in the center of town, modest but big enough for the four of them. Dia and Tess shared a bedroom, the close quarters often reason for their sisterly bickering. Haven saw proof of it as soon as she arrived, a piece of duct tape on the carpet running straight down the center of the room, cutting it in half. The left was clean and decorated with shades of pink and posters of movie stars, while the right half was in disarray, hundreds of photographs covering the wall.</p><p>\u201cHave a seat,\u201d Dia said, motioning toward a chair in front of a desk. Haven sat on the edge of it and glanced around at the mess, fighting off the urge to clean for her. \u201cSo, are you excited?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I am,\u201d Haven said, although her anxiety overshadowed her excitement.</p><p>Dia eyed Haven peculiarly as she fiddled with her hair, running her fingers through the wild locks. \u201cNervous, huh? Your answer sounded way too rehearsed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am excited,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve just never been to a dance before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, either,\u201d Dia said. \u201cThe only reason I\u2019m going to this one is because I have to cover it for the yearbook. Otherwise, I\u2019d stay home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have a date?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cThe administration would have an aneurysm if I brought someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Dia looked at her with surprise. \u201cNot everyone is accepting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t they accept you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not into boys,\u201d Dia said, treading carefully with her words. \u201cNo one\u2019s told you that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Carmine said he didn\u2019t have the right equipment for you.\u201d Haven turned bright red when what he\u2019d meant sank in. \u201cOh, he means\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo dick for Dia!\u201d</p><p>Haven glanced at the doorway as the voice interrupted. Tess strolled into the room, tossing a garment bag on her bed and unzipping it to expose a bloodred dress.</p><p>Dia rolled her eyes. \u201cClassy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just speaking the truth,\u201d Tess said, pulling off her shirt. Haven gaped at her as she stripped out of her clothes. Tess noticed her expression and laughed, standing in front of her in a bra and panties. \u201cI\u2019m not ashamed.\u201d</p><p>Dia laughed. \u201cShe\u2019s not modest, either.\u201d</p><p>Tess shrugged, not arguing against that. She shimmied into her dress before grabbing a pair of high heels from the closet and slipping them on. Strolling over to her dresser, she gazed at her reflection in the vanity mirror and smoothed her hair before applying some red lipstick. She did it so casually, so quickly, so fluidly. Haven watched with admiration.</p><p>Dia continued to play around with her hair, yanking and tugging it every which way, but Haven had no idea what she was trying to do. The same thought ran through Tess\u2019s mind because she turned around, groaning. \u201cDia, what are you doing to the poor girl\u2019s head?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to French braid it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrench braid? What is she, twelve?\u201d</p><p>Tess grabbed a flat iron and bumped her sister out of the way as she plugged it in. Shrugging, Dia plopped down on the bed as Tess undid the sloppy braid. Once the flat iron was warm, she straightened Haven\u2019s hair, smoothing the waves that had never before been so tame. Tess pulled the top half back, securing it with a clip, before unplugging the flat iron and going back to her side of the room.</p><p>Dia showed Haven to the bathroom to put on her dress. Haven slipped into it and glanced in the mirror, not recognizing the girl staring back. Her hair was bone straight and shiny under the glow of the light. The dress hugged her in all the right places, accentuating her newfound curves.</p><p>Curves. She pinched her hips with awe, wondering where they had come from and how she hadn\u2019t noticed them before.</p><p>She headed to the bedroom, pausing near the doorway. Tess gazed in her mirror again, applying another coat of lipstick, while Dia slipped on a pair of black combat boots.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have to get dressed?\u201d Haven asked Dia as she dropped a pair of gold flats in front of her.</p><p>\u201cI am dressed.\u201d</p><p>Haven put on the shoes as she surveyed Dia\u2019s clothes. She had on a black skirt and a vibrant blue tank top with rainbow-striped tights. \u201cYou are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is,\u201d Tess said. \u201cTo Dia, that\u2019s dressed up.\u201d</p><p>The hairs on the back of Haven\u2019s neck stood on end the moment she stepped into the grocery store alone, the feeling of being watched overwhelming. Self-consciously, she put her head down and walked swiftly to the soda aisle. Bending down to grab a twelve-pack of Coke, her skin prickled as a presence approached.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you call cheese that doesn\u2019t belong to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure, Nicholas.\u201d She picked up the soda and turned to face him, stunned to see him wearing a black suit. It was the first time she had seen him without his flip-flops and baseball cap.</p><p>\u201cNacho cheese.\u201d He grinned. \u201cGet it, nacho, not yo\u2019? Not yo\u2019 cheese, since it isn\u2019t yours?\u201d</p><p>The moment it clicked, she shook her head. \u201cThat\u2019s cheesy.\u201d</p><p>He laughed at her attempt at humor. \u201cFunny. My kind of girl.\u201d</p><p>She blushed. \u201cThank you. I see you\u2019re dressed up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I am. It\u2019s prom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to the dance? You don\u2019t go to school here, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither do you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I have someone to go with.\u201d</p><p>He sighed dramatically. \u201cYeah, well, so do I. I may not be a pretty boy like Carmine, but I can still pull my fair share of ladies. Speaking of your boyfriend . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t start.\u201d</p><p>He held his hands up defensively. \u201cHey, I was just going to say I\u2019m surprised he\u2019s letting you in public by yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t he? I can go to a store alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you?\u201d The seriousness to his voice sent her nerves flaring. Could she? Considering this was her first time doing it, she had a hard time answering yes.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she said, eyeing him suspiciously. Her heart pounded furiously in her chest. He couldn\u2019t know the truth. Carmine would have warned her.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s nice,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know, you have a fascinating accent.\u201d</p><p>She was taken aback by the shift in conversation. \u201cI have an accent? I think you do.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cI sound like everyone else around here, but I\u2019ve never heard an accent like yours. Where did you grow up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalifornia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat parts?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated. \u201cThe desert.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cNo wonder I\u2019ve never heard it. You\u2019re the first native Californian I\u2019ve met. You were born there, right?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, his line of questioning baffling her.</p><p>\u201cWell, Haven, since I was wrong and you can go out by yourself, you should come visit me sometime.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed at the invitation. \u201cWhy are you interested?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou seem like a nice girl,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no harm in us being friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to be friends because you want to get to know me, or do you want to be friends because it\u2019ll upset Carmine? Because I can\u2019t be friends with someone who wants to hurt him.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She spouted off the words, not comprehending what she was saying until it was already past her lips and lingering in the air between them.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not that petty of a person,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cHow am I supposed to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d have to trust me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t trust people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you trust him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d she said, \u201cand nothing you say will change that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, but that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t trust me, too.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him. Could she trust him? \u201cI should go.\u201d</p> <p>She walked away, pausing briefly when he called out to her. \u201cHaven? You look beautiful. Carmine may be an asshole, but he\u2019s a lucky asshole.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cThank you, but I think I\u2019m the lucky one.\u201d</p><p>After paying for the soda, Haven drove back to the DeMarcos\u2019 house to find a new shiny sports car parked out front. As she opened the front door, she was about to call out for Carmine when there was a bang in the kitchen. \u201cWhat fucking took you so long?\u201d</p><p>She sighed, not bothering with an answer. If he was in a bad mood, nothing would change it.</p><p>She paused in the doorway to the kitchen, stunned at the sight of him. He had on a black suit with a blue tie and a pair of black Nikes. Carmine turned to her, his eyes instantly raking down her body as she set the soda on the counter and handed one of the cans of Coke to him. He took it carefully, his eyes never leaving her.</p><p>She turned to leave the room, her nerves getting the best of her, but Carmine grabbed her arm to stop her. \u201cYou\u2019re breathtaking.\u201d</p> <p>His eyes flickered to her mouth, and he kissed her sweetly. She parted her lips, welcoming him to deepen it, but instead he pulled away. It had become a common occurrence the past few weeks, a consequence of his recent temperament.</p><p>He turned his back to her to fill a glass with ice as she headed for the family room, sitting on the couch and folding her hands in her lap to wait. Carmine strolled in after a minute and set his glass down on the table, a plastic container in his other hand. He pulled a blue and gold flower out of it and slipped it on her wrist. \u201cIt\u2019s a corsage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful,\u201d she said, gazing at it.</p><p>The front door to the house opened, and Dr. DeMarco walked in. \u201cThat\u2019s a nice car outside,\u201d he said right away, forgoing any type of greeting.</p><p>Carmine sighed. \u201cDon\u2019t worry\u2014I rented it. It\u2019ll go back tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Dominic and Tess showed up a few minutes later, followed by a disgruntled Dia. They huddled outside to take some pictures. After a few minutes of cameras flashing, Carmine grabbed Haven\u2019s hand and pulled her away. He hesitated at his car, scanning it for damage, before heading toward the rental. \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted a Vanquish. I feel like James Bond driving this motherfucker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJames Bond?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you know\u2014007, the secret agent?\u201d She shook her head, and he sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s a movie.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSorry,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d he said, motioning for her to get in. She wanted to believe him, but his frustrated expression told a different story.</p><p>The drive to the restaurant was quiet as Haven\u2019s nerves ran amuck. After about thirty minutes, she couldn\u2019t take the silence anymore and attempted conversation. \u201cThis is a pretty car. You couldn\u2019t get one of these instead of yours?\u201d</p><p>He laughed dryly. \u201cThis costs six times more than my Mazda. There\u2019s no way my father would fork over a quarter-million dollars for a car. The only thing he\u2019d spend that much on is a house.\u201d He paused. \u201cOr you, maybe. Don\u2019t know how much he paid for you.\u201d</p><p>His words stung. She blinked a few times, willing herself not to let her hurt show as she turned to stare out the window.</p><p>\u201cAnd I guess it\u2019s pretty, if you can call a car pretty.\u201d</p><p>Haven didn\u2019t speak the rest of the drive.</p><p>They arrived at the restaurant, and Carmine led her inside to join the others. He occasionally said something that rubbed her the wrong way while they ate, but someone would diffuse the situation before it spiraled. Haven wasn\u2019t fond of this side of Carmine. It was a part of him she wasn\u2019t well acquainted with . . . a part of him she didn\u2019t want to know.</p><p>The waitress came by to make sure they had everything they needed, her eyes lingering on Carmine longer than necessary. He ignored her like he usually did, but Tess didn\u2019t let it slide. \u201cShe could see your girlfriend sitting right beside you. Doesn\u2019t she have any self-respect?\u201d</p><p>Carmine shrugged. \u201cBitches can\u2019t help it.\u201d</p><p>Tess glared at him, his response not what she wanted to hear. \u201cWhat the hell\u2019s got into you?\u201d</p><p>Carmine\u2019s brow furrowed. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour attitude, that\u2019s what. It\u2019s a damn shame, too. I almost liked you for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, I never fucking liked you.\u201d</p><p>Haven tensed at the hostility as Dominic hit the table with his fist. \u201cEnough! I don\u2019t know what your problem is, Carmine, but you need to figure it out. I\u2019m this close to laying your ass out.\u201d</p><p>Carmine glared at his brother. \u201cWhat have I done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you not hear yourself? You\u2019re acting more and more like the old you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not,\u201d Carmine said.</p><p>\u201cYes, you are,\u201d Dominic said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m telling you now\u2014fix it. Haven deserves better than the way you\u2019ve been treating her.\u201d</p><p>Haven watched Carmine warily as he stared at his brother. The tension at the table was thick, and she started to panic. \u201cI, uh . . . I need to go to the restroom.\u201d</p><p>She stood, and Dia jumped to her feet to show her where it was. She breathed a sigh of relief once she was alone and stayed there until she calmed down. There was a tap on the door, and she expected to see Dia still waiting, but instead came face-to-face with Carmine.</p><p>\u201cCan we talk, tesoro?\u201d She nodded and followed him outside to the car. Carmine put the key into the ignition. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize I was being such an asshole. I\u2019ve had a lot on my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to talk about it?\u201d</p><p>He sighed, drumming his fingers against the steering wheel. \u201cNot really. That probably makes me a bigger asshole, but I just . . . can we start over? You finally get a chance to experience teenage shit, and I\u2019m fucking it up. I should be groveling at your feet, thanking you for giving me this chance. You shouldn\u2019t love me, but you do, and you don\u2019t know how thankful I am for that, how much I appreciate having you in my life.\u201d</p><p>She gazed at him with surprise. It was the nicest thing he had said in a while . . . possibly ever. \u201cI\u2019m glad I have you, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he said, starting the car as Haven put on her seatbelt. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sorry about the Nikes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTess said they give the impression I don\u2019t care, but I do. I just really like my Nikes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like them, too.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her with the first genuine smile she\u2019d seen grace his lips all evening.</p><p>The school gymnasium was decorated in white and gold, sparkling lights strung up all over the ceiling. A balloon archway greeted them inside, streamers and glitter covering everything. Carmine grimaced at the cheap decorations, while Haven was completely mesmerized. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty,\u201d she said, her words barely audible above the thumping bass of the song.</p><p>He chuckled at her enthusiasm. \u201cDo you wanna dance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI, uh . . .\u201d She surveyed the crowd on the dance floor. \u201cI\u2019ve never danced.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot true,\u201d he said, pulling her in front of him with his hands on her hips. \u201cWe danced on Halloween.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s different,\u201d she said. \u201cYou kind of just swung me in circles, and nobody was watching.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one\u2019s watching now.\u201d He was lying. Eyes focused on them from all over the gym. \u201cBesides, the only way to learn how to dance is by dancing, and I think I\u2019m getting better at this teaching gig.\u201d</p><p>They stopped along the edge of the crowd, and he pulled her against him, swaying them to the music. He leaned down with his lips beside her ear and sang along, his voice relaxing her.</p><p>Carmine moved her hips to the beat until she was able to keep rhythm on her own. She saw the curious onlookers watching, but Carmine\u2019s warmth made her feel safe. They danced for a few songs before he led her over toward a table, grabbing two plastic cups and pouring punch in them.</p><p>They mingled with his classmates for a bit. Haven caught sight of Nicholas after a while with Lisa clinging to his arm. She avoided eye contact with him, focusing her attention on Carmine, but she could feel his gaze from across the room.</p><p>The punch eventually caught up to her, and she excused herself to use the restroom. She was washing her hands when the door opened, hostility filling the confined space as Lisa walked in. There was no way to leave without walking past her, so Haven shut off the water and took a deep breath. After drying her hands, she took a few steps in her direction.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d she said, hoping she would let her go without trouble, but Lisa didn\u2019t move an inch. \u201cI\u2019d like to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like you to leave too,\u201d Lisa said. \u201cLeave town, and leave Carmine alone.\u201d</p><p>The way Lisa leered, getting pleasure from her pain, reminded Haven of Katrina and all the times she had kicked her when she was already down. There hadn\u2019t been anything she could do about it then, but she didn\u2019t have to take it anymore. Not here, not now. She wasn\u2019t going to hand over control to people who wanted nothing more than for her to hurt.</p><p>\u201cI said excuse me.\u201d Haven took another step forward. Lisa didn\u2019t move, so Haven bumped into her and grabbed the door. She swung it open and stepped out as Lisa gripped her shoulder. Haven turned around in enough time to see her make a fist.</p><p>Before Lisa could attack, arms jerked Haven away, and Nicholas absorbed the force of the punch in his chest. \u201cWhoa, Laila Ali, watch where you\u2019re swinging!\u201d</p><p>Lisa sneered at him. \u201cWhat did you call me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a boxer,\u201d Haven said. \u201cMuhammad Ali\u2019s daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you talking?\u201d Lisa asked, taking a step toward her. \u201cNobody asked you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey now.\u201d Nicholas tried to come between them, but he wasn\u2019t quick enough. Lisa gripped Haven\u2019s arm, tearing her corsage off and hurling it onto the floor. Nicholas intervened again, and Lisa stomped away as he picked up Haven\u2019s flower.</p><p>She took it carefully as he smiled, but something was off about his expression, something that spiked Haven\u2019s anxiety. \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve known the DeMarcos for a long time, you know,\u201d he said. \u201cWe used to be close, and when you spend a lot of time with people, you learn things about them. Like . . . some of the stuff their family does.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her brow furrowed. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not an idiot, Haven,\u201d he said, his voice low. \u201cI have no intention of dying any time soon, that\u2019s for sure. I know how to keep my mouth shut, but I can\u2019t hold it in anymore. You told me you were from California, when not long ago Carmine said you were from Chicago. And they don\u2019t just invite people to live with them. They don\u2019t let anyone get close unless they can control them some way, and it freaks me out what that means for you.\u201d</p><p>She felt queasy. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean you aren\u2019t some friend of the family. I think you had no choice whether you came here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI had a choice,\u201d she said, remembering Dr. DeMarco\u2019s words that first day. \u201cWe always have a choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, it\u2019s not like I can do anything. I\u2019m just a kid, and I don\u2019t know your situation. For all I know, you could\u2019ve been kidnapped and are being held for ransom, or, hell, maybe you\u2019re in hiding. I don\u2019t know, but that doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t feel bad knowing you might be trapped.\u201d</p><p>She was nervous to talk about it in public. \u201cThey\u2019re nice to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure they are, but that doesn\u2019t make it right, and it makes me sick that Carmine\u2019s taking advantage of you.\u201d</p><p>Her fingernails dug into her palms as she tried to keep from reacting. \u201cCarmine loves me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have a hard time believing he loves anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me guess, he\u2019s the first person to treat you that way? He smiles at you and whispers sweet nothings in your ear? He speaks Italian and makes you swoon? Yeah, he did that to every girl in this building at some point. That\u2019s who he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing\u2019s going to change my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, but like I said, that doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t be friends. If you need to talk, I\u2019m around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you care so much?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause somebody should.\u201d</p><p>She opened her mouth to tell him Carmine cared, but before she could, Carmine\u2019s seething voice rang out behind them. \u201cLeave her alone!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNicholas helped me,\u201d Haven said right away, not wanting him to get the wrong idea.</p><p>Carmine wrapped his arm around her waist as he glared at Nicholas. \u201cHelped you with what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLisa cornered her, so I did what any man would do,\u201d Nicholas said. \u201cActually, most would\u2019ve watched two chicks going at it, but I didn\u2019t want Lisa to get her ass whipped at prom. I\u2019m hoping for a little action tonight.\u201d</p><p>Carmine looked at her. \u201cLisa tried to fight with you? Again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see it\u2019s not a one-time occurrence,\u201d Nicholas said.</p><p>Haven held up her corsage. \u201cShe broke my flower.\u201d</p> <p>He took it from her and cursed under his breath, pulling her away when Nicholas\u2019s voice called out. \u201cKnock, knock.\u201d</p><p>Feeling guilty, she looked at him once more. \u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d</p><p>Carmine stopped moving, not amused.</p><p>\u201cTank,\u201d Nicholas said.</p><p>\u201cTank who?\u201d She got it the moment the words rolled from her lips. Tank who . . . Thank you.</p><p>Nicholas smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome, Haven.\u201d</p><p>Soft music played and people paired up to dance as Carmine put his hands on Haven\u2019s hips, drawing her closer. \u201cYou okay, tesoro? She didn\u2019t hurt you, did she?\u201d</p><p>Wrapping her arms around his neck, she gazed at him. \u201cNo, Nicholas stopped her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNicholas,\u201d Carmine sneered under his breath, his eyes darting across the room to where Haven knew he still stood. \u201cHe\u2019s always involving himself in shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m grateful for it,\u201d Haven said. \u201cLisa punched him instead of me.\u201d</p><p>Those words sparked a smile on Carmine\u2019s face. \u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>Haven rolled her eyes as Carmine licked his lips, kissing her slowly as they swayed to the music. Love swelled inside of her. This was her Carmine, the one who wasn\u2019t afraid to let his guard down and let her inside. In the middle of a crowded room, no one existed but them. He was all she saw, all she was aware of\u2014his face, his smell, his warmth, his love.</p><p>The emotion took control of her as tears threatened to spill over. The song wound down, and the two of them stood in the center of the dance floor, staring at each other. \u201cCan we . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, let\u2019s go home.\u201d</p><p>Carmine was all over Haven the moment they stepped foot onto the third floor of the house. His lips captured hers in a fiery kiss as he pulled her tightly against him. It had been a while since he had kissed her this way, as if he needed to siphon the air from her lungs to breathe.</p><p>\u201cCarmine, we should . . .\u201d She shivered when his lips moved to her neck. \u201c. . . I think we really should . . .\u201d She let out a whimper as he nipped at her skin with his teeth. \u201c. . . It\u2019s just that . . .\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know what she was saying, what she meant, why she was even trying to talk. She couldn\u2019t think straight. Every cell in her body yearned for him, wildly rejoicing at the feel of his hands on her again, yet the words kept spilling out on their own.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should just, you know . . .\u201d</p><p>Carmine groaned, a mixture of desire and frustration. \u201cI need you.\u201d</p><p>That was all she had to hear. His declaration took every hesitant word that was on the tip of her tongue and replaced them with much different ones. \u201cI need you, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been too long,\u201d he whispered as they stumbled through the library, toward the bedroom. \u201cI need to feel you again. I need to be with you, on top of you. Fuck, I need to be inside of you.\u201d</p><p>A feral groan vibrated her chest at those words, a sound she never realized she was capable of making. They barely had time to get inside the bedroom and shut the door before they were tearing at each other\u2019s clothes. She dropped her dress to the floor, stepping out of it, as Carmine kicked off his shoes. They flung fabric across the room, the glow of the moon filtering through the window the only light they had to see. Carmine slapped at the wall, looking for the light switch, but gave up with a resigned grunt in a matter of seconds.</p><p>Haven let out a yelp of surprise when he clutched her thighs and quickly pulled her up. Her legs wrapped around his waist as he pressed into her, sending a shiver through the core of her body, seizing her muscles. She clung to his neck, kissing him feverishly as he stumbled a few steps, tripping over her discarded shoes.</p><p>She pulled back from his lips. \u201cDon\u2019t drop me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever,\u201d he said breathlessly the same moment his grip slipped. He dropped her onto the mattress and she laughed as she bounced.</p><p>\u201cNever, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did that shit on purpose, tesoro,\u201d he said playfully, chuckling as he climbed over her.</p><p>Their bodies fit together easily, perfectly, like they had always belonged that way. It was lightning, and thunder, and electricity, as the two souls merged as one. All was forgotten as they gave in to their raw needs, each stroke longer, deeper, harder, their moans and grunts and cries louder and louder.</p><p>They stilled their movements when they had nothing more to give, covered in sweat and breathing heavily. Haven lay on top of him, her head on his bare chest as she tried to calm her wildly beating heart. She could feel Carmine\u2019s beneath her, his pulse racing twice its normal speed.</p><p>He caressed her side and thigh, drawing patterns on her skin with his fingertips. She wondered what he was thinking, what he was drawing, but part of her was afraid to ask.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said eventually. \u201cI\u2019ve been holding back, and that\u2019s not fair to you. I know I\u2019m a pain in the ass, but you\u2019re the only good thing I have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t apologize,\u201d she said. He asked her to forgive him for something she had been doing, too. He gave her everything, had taken her to his prom, and she had gotten to wear a pretty dress and dance with a devastatingly handsome boy. It was her dream, a dream she had never thought possible. She felt inadequate sometimes, and she knew it was her insecurities eating away at her. But now . . . now she truly felt she didn\u2019t. \u201cCarmine, I have to tell you something.\u201d</p><p>His fingertips stilled midpattern on her stomach. \u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think Nicholas knows about me.\u201d</p><p>Carmine sat up quickly. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe knows I\u2019m a . . . slave.\u201d</p><p>His eyes darkened. \u201cDid he fucking call you that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he just knows\u2014or he suspects\u2014I\u2019m not here willingly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. He said he wanted to be friends, because he thought I could use one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wants to be friends? Yeah, right. That motherfucker wants what I have. He wants to take everything from me! Don\u2019t you see that?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. Honestly, she wasn\u2019t sure anymore.</p><p>The past month had been one of the most complicated of Carmine\u2019s life, his love and anger at odds with each other. An epic battle brewed inside him, different sides fighting for control of his heart and mind. Everything pushed him over the edge, and what Haven had told him wasn\u2019t helping him remain calm.</p><p>After she was asleep, he threw on some clothes and headed downstairs. The light was on in his father\u2019s office so he tentatively knocked on the door, waiting a moment before opening it. Vincent looked at him from behind his desk. \u201cYou\u2019re the last person I expected to see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he asked, sitting in the chair across from him.</p><p>\u201cBecause you knocked. That\u2019s not like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, I don\u2019t know myself anymore, so I guess I\u2019m capable of anything at this point.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cAre you dealing okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m over that shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe that for a second,\u201d Vincent said. \u201cIt took me years to come to grips with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t have years. I don\u2019t even wanna think about it, much less talk about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, then.\u201d Vincent eyed him peculiarly. \u201cIs there another reason you came down here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s about tonight\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow was prom? Did you have a good time?\u201d</p><p>Carmine groaned, irritated he cut him off. \u201cIt was fucking peachy, Dad. Now can I finish?\u201d</p><p>Vincent waved him on.</p><p>\u201cWe ran into Nicholas, and he said something. He said he knew the truth about Haven.\u201d</p><p>Carmine watched as his father\u2019s expression shifted, a blank mask overcoming his face. Each second of silence grated on his nerves. Why was he just sitting there?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible he knows more than he should.\u201d</p><p>Carmine sat forward. \u201cMy enemy knows the truth, and you didn\u2019t think to tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not your enemy, Carmine. I know what enemies are. I know the threats they pose. Nicholas knows no more than Dia or Tess. I can\u2019t kill him any more than I could kill those girls. Or is that what you\u2019re suggesting\u2014wiping out everyone who might know? That\u2019s not how you get a clean slate with her, son. You can\u2019t run from the truth.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut how can he be trusted when he\u2019s betrayed me before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause if he was going to tell, he would\u2019ve by now,\u201d Vincent said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to murder a seventeen-year-old kid because you think it\u2019ll make you feel better. You\u2019ll deal with the guilt of his death for the rest of your life, and I have enough people to worry about right now.\u201d</p><p>Carmine stared at his father. \u201cLike him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo you haven\u2019t figured out how to deal with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just delaying the inevitable, hoping when the time comes I do the right thing . . . whatever that may be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, I could probably guess who\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even go down that path, Carmine Marcello,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you again.\u201d</p><p>Carmine nodded, but there was no way he could stop thinking about it. \u201cThere are only so many people you\u2019d be afraid of, though.\u201d</p> <p>Vincent lost his cool and stood, shoving his chair back and pointing at the door. \u201cGet out.\u201d</p><p>Carmine begrudgingly headed to the third floor and collided with Haven at the top of the stairs. \u201cWhoa! Where are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know where you went,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWhere I\u2019ve been doesn\u2019t matter. All that matters is where I am now.\u201d He scanned her. She had on a pair of his flannel pants, rolled up to stay on, and his football shirt\u2014the same thing she\u2019d worn that first day in the kitchen. \u201cYou know, you look good in my clothes, but how about we go take them back off?\u201d</p><p>She gasped as he pulled her to his room. \u201cWell, good morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s definitely about to be a good morning,\u201d he said playfully. \u201cAnd a good afternoon. And a good evening, if I\u2019m lucky.\u201d</p> <p>They made love quietly on and off all afternoon, careful not to be overheard. She sprawled out on the bed beside him after a while, sleeping peacefully on her stomach. The blanket barely covered her bottom half, leaving her back exposed. He stared at her skin, wishing she\u2019d never gotten any of those marks. He wished she\u2019d never had to experience pain, and he hated those fucking scars. But on the other hand, they were a part of her, and to him, there was nothing ugly about her.</p><p>She deserved more than she had, and Carmine couldn\u2019t wait to give it to her. To give her a real life where she was free. Free of her imaginary chains, free of heartache, free of danger. Just . . . free.</p><p>He traced the word with his finger over her scarred back. Free. It was all that mattered to him.</p><p>33</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to die.\u201d</p><p>Those four words cracked the silence that had enveloped the room. Vincent fought the urge to balk, instead keeping his calm disposition. It wasn\u2019t like it was something he hadn\u2019t already thought to himself dozens of times, but hearing it verbalized in that cold, emotionless voice made it real.</p><p>He looked in the direction the words had come from and met Corrado\u2019s piercing eyes, so dark Vincent couldn\u2019t differentiate between the pupil and the iris. They were the same eyes dozens had looked into during their last moments on earth, eyes that could break the hardest of men. They were the eyes of a murderer, a man who could reach inside his coat, pull out his .22-caliber Ruger Mark II pistol, and put a bullet in Vincent before he knew what was happening. More importantly, they were the eyes of a man who wouldn\u2019t hesitate to do it if necessary.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Vincent said, keeping his voice even despite his anxiety.</p> <p>It was the first of June, and tomorrow Dominic would graduate from high school. Out of everything Vincent had done in life, Dominic felt like his greatest accomplishment. Just the fact that he had survived intact and was setting off on a path that didn\u2019t resemble the one he had walked down at his age made Vincent feel as if he had done something right. Here was something he hadn\u2019t destroyed, someone\u2019s life he hadn\u2019t ruined.</p><p>But his pride was overshadowed by another event, one that had forced him to break his silence. In two short days, Carmine would turn eighteen. His youngest son would be emancipated in the eyes of the law and outside forces were threatening to take his life away. The Don wanted the Principe, a puppet he could mold into a brutal, calculating soldier. Sal wasn\u2019t above manipulation, and Vincent was afraid of what he would do to get his hands on Carmine.</p><p>Corrado and Celia had flown in for Dominic\u2019s graduation and to celebrate Carmine\u2019s birthday. The kids had gotten up before dawn to head to Asheville for the afternoon, and Celia was upstairs, purposely giving the two men some space.</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t look like a Principessa,\u201d Corrado said.</p><p>\u201cI had the same thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re positive of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always suspected there was more to that girl,\u201d Corrado said. \u201cIt never made sense that Frankie would put a hit out on your wife because she was interested in his granddaughter. Sure, he treated the girl horribly, but it wasn\u2019t worth going to extreme measures to cover up. But this . . . this is worth killing over.\u201d</p><p>Vincent cringed. Corrado noticed his reaction and clarified. \u201cNot saying she should\u2019ve died. I still, to this day, wish I would\u2019ve done more, but I never thought Antonelli could be so heinous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of us did.\u201d</p><p>Corrado looked away from him. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe she\u2019s one of our own. It\u2019s surreal to discover, after all of these years, the little slave girl is Joseph and Federica\u2019s granddaughter. Their baby survived and ended up in Antonelli\u2019s care. What are the odds they\u2019d be related to . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSalvatore,\u201d Vincent said.</p><p>\u201cHe has surviving family, after all.\u201d</p><p>So many people had been lost in the chaos of the \u201970s, a lot of bodies never recovered. It started with one man making a spectacle of the lifestyle and escalated to a clash that spread throughout the country. It became about revenge and bloodshed, men going against everything the organizations stood for in the name of vengeance. The same families that had sworn to protect women and children were so blinded by hatred they took it out on the innocent.</p><p>Joseph Russo had been discovered buried in a cornfield years later. Antonio sent men out looking for Federica, hoping she had gone undercover with their baby. But a bundle had been dropped off on his doorstep one night, human bones wrapped in a pink baby blanket. There were no DNA tests in those days, but everyone believed it then\u2014Federica and the baby were dead.</p><p>But they\u2019d been wrong. The baby had survived, going by the name Miranda, living right under their noses their entire time.</p><p>\u201cI knew you were hiding something, but I never imagined it would be this,\u201d Corrado said. \u201cThe odds of that woman turning out to be Sal\u2019s dead niece are about as likely as Jimmy Hoffa showing up tomorrow on the corner of Lincoln Avenue and Orchard Street.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m inclined to believe anything\u2019s possible now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d Corrado said. \u201cThey disappeared around the same time. I\u2019ll be on the lookout for Hoffa whenever I\u2019m in the neighborhood.\u201d</p><p>His tone was so serious Vincent couldn\u2019t be sure if he was joking or not. He usually couldn\u2019t with Corrado and didn\u2019t dare laugh either way.</p><p>\u201cSo whoever killed them gave the baby to the Antonellis, and Frankie took the child knowing who she was. He ordered the wife of a fellow Mafioso murdered to retain his secret, because he knew what he\u2019d done would be an automatic death sentence,\u201d Corrado said, summing up in a few seconds what had taken Vincent an hour to stumble through.</p><p>\u201cAs it would be for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou understand why I\u2019ve done what I\u2019ve done, right?\u201d Vincent asked. \u201cYou understand why I couldn\u2019t turn the girl over to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t still be sitting here if some part of me didn\u2019t,\u201d Corrado said. \u201cThe fallout would be disastrous. Not only would you be killed on principle, but her life would also be in danger. Squint\u2019s set upon inheriting the dynasty, banking on the fact that he\u2019s the closest thing the Don has left to a relative. Carmine\u2019s in enough danger because of Sal\u2019s interest in him. Adding the girl to the equation would jeopardize them both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to mention what it would mean for the organization,\u201d Vincent said. \u201cThey never determined who killed Joseph and Federica, or what they did with her body. Sal would go on a rampage, and we have enough problems right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019d start another war,\u201d Corrado said. \u201cWe\u2019d all be in danger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. And I\u2019m not worried about myself. I just don\u2019t want the kids to be taken down by this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you want the Principe and the Principessa to ride off into the sunset and live happily ever after? That\u2019s not asking for too much, right?\u201d he asked, his voice mocking. \u201cI hate to break it to you, but this is the real world, Vincent. I have a greater chance of getting you out of this than I do of keeping them unscathed. I honestly don\u2019t know what you expect of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not asking you to do anything. I just\u2014\u201d</p><p>Corrado cut him off. \u201cYou\u2019re getting soft. I don\u2019t know what happened to you, but I don\u2019t like it. You claim you aren\u2019t trying to involve me, but you\u2019ve done so from day one by involving my wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t intend\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m sure you didn\u2019t intend it, but I would\u2019ve thought you, of all people, would understand. You lost your wife to this, and now you\u2019re putting me in the same situation! For someone who grieved so wholly, you surely didn\u2019t hesitate to set me up to endure the same. I want nothing more than to refuse your request right now, but I can\u2019t. I have to help you, even though it goes against everything I\u2019ve sworn myself to, because it\u2019s the only way to protect Celia.\u201d He stared at him pointedly. \u201cThis girl better be worth it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was to Maura.\u201d</p><p>Corrado rubbed his face with frustration. \u201cThe things we do for women. What possessed you to run her DNA in the first place? You know who her parents are.\u201d</p><p>Vincent sighed. \u201cI wanted to get her a green card.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA green card?\u201d he asked incredulously.</p><p>\u201cI knew it was too risky to try to get her a birth certificate, so I thought I could get a green card to legally establish her here. With her father being a citizen, she\u2019d be approved as long as the relationship could be established. I knew Michael wouldn\u2019t agree willingly, so I thought a DNA test could strong-arm him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you couldn\u2019t just ask me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you\u2014I didn\u2019t want to involve you.\u201d</p><p>Corrado shook his head. \u201cDo you think Antonelli knows?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt it. He wouldn\u2019t have given up the girl so easily if he knew. He would\u2019ve bartered for more. And I\u2019m sure he didn\u2019t know anything when . . . it happened.\u201d</p><p>Corrado watched him intently. \u201cIt\u2019s been five years now, huh?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cToday,\u201d he said. \u201cToday makes five years.\u201d</p><p>June first, the anniversary of the day Vincent hit rock bottom. Most would assume bottom was when his wife died, or the year after when he\u2019d been unable to face his children, but rock bottom came years later . . .</p><p>Closing his eyes, he could still feel the hot air blowing in his face as he sped down the desolate highway. His hands shook, his body desperate for rest, but there was no way he could have stopped. He\u2019d gone too far to give in.</p><p>His cell phone chimed loudly from the passenger seat, the harsh green light illuminating the darkness. His heart pounded vigorously at the sound, adrenaline surging through him. He ignored it like he had the last dozen times it rang.</p> <p>For twenty-six hours he\u2019d been driving, blatantly disregarding the code, but he wasn\u2019t thinking of the future. He wanted vengeance. He had walked inside that house in Lincoln Park the day before and stood in front of the man who controlled his life, hearing the four words that pushed him forward. \u201cFrankie Antonelli did it.\u201d</p><p>Frankie Antonelli did it.</p><p>The closer Vincent got to the secluded ranch, the more frenzied he grew. A few miles from the turnoff to the property, the headlights of a car flashed his way. Vincent slowed down, watching as the familiar car whizzed by. Rage consumed him.</p><p>Frankie Antonelli did it.</p><p>Vincent made a U-turn and accelerated rapidly to catch up. Red lights flared in front of him as they hit the brakes, noticing Vincent\u2019s approach. Frankie could have outrun him, but by the time he realized what was happening, it was too late. Vincent rammed into him, turning the wheel and clipping the back corner of the car. His chest slammed into the steering wheel on impact, his vision blurring as he painfully gasped for air.</p> <p>Tires squealed, followed by a loud crash as Frankie\u2019s car flew into some large boulders jutting out of the desert. Vincent swerved before coming to a stop in the opposite direction on the highway, the car still intact and on all four wheels. Smoke and dust lingered from the collision, making Vincent\u2019s eyes water. He rubbed his face, his vision blurring, and he took a deep breath as he grabbed his pistol from the floorboard. Stepping out, his weak legs shook as he put weight on them.</p><p>Frankie Antonelli did it.</p><p>Frankie\u2019s car was totaled, the front end demolished from the impact. As Vincent approached, he heard wheezing from the driver\u2019s side. The window was shattered, glass crunching under his feet. Frankie\u2019s legs were crushed under the front of the car, while his wife, Monica, slumped over in the passenger seat. Blood poured from her ears. Glancing back at Frankie, Vincent could see tears streaming down his face. \u201cFrankie Antonelli did it,\u201d he said, his voice oddly calm.</p><p>Frankie tried to shield himself as Vincent brought up the gun, slamming it in the man\u2019s face as he blacked out in rage. By the time he resurfaced, the body in the driver\u2019s seat was unrecognizable and Vincent\u2019s hands were coated in blood.</p><p>He took a few deep breaths, trying to ignore the pain in his chest as he stepped back from the wreckage. Gas pooled underneath the car, the odor of it strong. Vincent scoured through his pockets and pulled out the beat-up pack of Marlboros. There was one cigarette left. He lit it, feeling the burn as the smoke scorched his lungs. The nicotine soothed his nerves.</p><p>After a few drags of the cigarette, he flicked it toward the car, igniting the puddle of gas.</p> <p>Vincent climbed in his car and drove to the Antonellis\u2019 ranch, pulling down the driveway. The place appeared uninhabited, but that wasn\u2019t true. People were there, and he knew where to find them.</p><p>Without thinking it through, Vincent stepped inside the stables. He\u2019d take the girl. He\u2019d do it for Maura. He\u2019d make it all better. He\u2019d rescue her from filth.</p><p>He paused when he saw her asleep on a tattered old mattress in the corner stall, the stench of manure thick and stifling. He took a few steps toward her to get a better look and saw her clutching a book in her arms. So small and frail, she looked helpless, but Vincent wasn\u2019t fooled.</p><p>The bloodlust rose back up, desperation hitting him. He raised the gun and pointed it at her head, no hesitation as he pulled the trigger. Confusion hit him when nothing happened\u2014no loud bang, no piercing scream, no blood.</p><p>His Smith &amp; Wesson had never failed him before.</p><p>The sound of Corrado\u2019s voice pulled him from the vicious memory. \u201cIs that the last time you killed?\u201d</p><p>Vincent sighed. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as you realize you\u2019ll have to kill again, we shouldn\u2019t have a problem.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Vincent said as Corrado stood to walk out.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t thank me. You still might die.\u201d</p><p>34</p><p>Carmine spotted his uncle the moment they stepped through the front door. Corrado surveyed them, assessing like he always did, and Haven\u2019s head went down, her gaze focusing on the wood floor. Carmine reached for her instinctively, pulling her to him.</p><p>\u201cCorrado,\u201d Carmine said, nodding at him.</p><p>He returned the greeting. \u201cCarmine.\u201d</p><p>Carmine could feel Haven trembling, every exhale coming out as a shudder. Sighing, he leaned toward her and frantically searched for the right words to say. What could destroy the fear built up from being tortured for so many years and having the man in front of them refuse to help?</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a decent guy,\u201d Carmine said. \u201cMinus the whole murdering thing.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, that wasn\u2019t it.</p><p>Haven gripped Carmine\u2019s arm that was around her, her nails digging into his skin.</p><p>\u201cThis is my girlfriend, Haven,\u201d Carmine said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve actually met her before.\u201d</p><p>Everyone stared at him, but Carmine felt Haven relax in his arms. Her grip on him loosened as Corrado turned to her. \u201cNo, I haven\u2019t had the pleasure.\u201d</p><p>Haven remained silent for a moment before she spoke, her voice restrained. \u201cNice to meet you, sir.\u201d</p><p>She held out her hand to Corrado. Carmine stared at it, stunned, as she extended her hand to the man she knew had never considered extending his to her.</p><p>Corrado looked just as surprised as he shook it lightly. \u201cAs it is you. If you\u2019ll excuse me, I\u2019m going to settle in.\u201d</p><p>He headed upstairs, and Carmine smirked as Haven turned to look at him. There was curiosity in her eyes. \u201cYour girlfriend? It\u2019s not like he doesn\u2019t know what I am.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cWhat you are, Haven, is my girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo buts. Quit thinking about yourself that way. They\u2019re just technicalities.\u201d She cracked a smile as he used the word. \u201cThey\u2019re titles other people give us. They don\u2019t make us who we are. If you\u2019re a slave, than I\u2019m nothing more than Principe. Is that all I am? A Mafia prince?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought,\u201d he said. \u201cJust because some people see us that way doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s what we are. We\u2019ll overcome our labels together. They don\u2019t matter; they don\u2019t make us who we are. We make us who we are. Fuck those motherfuckers.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cWhen did you get so smart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby, I\u2019ve always been smart,\u201d he said playfully. \u201cI\u2019m just lazy as hell and rarely show it.\u201d</p><p>The atmosphere was awkward at the dinner table that night. Haven didn\u2019t appear comfortable, so Carmine placed his hand in her lap and soothingly rubbed her thigh.</p><p>Everyone disbursed after dinner, and Haven headed into the kitchen to clean up. Celia followed her, and Carmine lingered in the doorway for a bit, trying to stay out of the way. He was leaning against the doorframe while she loaded the dishwasher when a voice cleared behind him in the foyer.</p><p>\u201cI need to see you in my office,\u201d Vincent said.</p><p>Carmine scanned his head to make sure he hadn\u2019t done anything his father clearly had said \u201cdon\u2019t fucking do,\u201d but he came up blank for once. \u201cI\u2019ll be there in a minute.\u201d</p><p>After making sure Haven was fine, he went upstairs and stepped into the office the second he reached it. He hesitated in the doorway, noticing his uncle standing off to the side.</p><p>\u201cDoes he ever knock?\u201d Corrado asked.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s getting better at it,\u201d Vincent said.</p><p>Carmine groaned as he sat down. \u201cDid you call me here for a lesson on manners?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but they\u2019re important to have,\u201d Corrado said. \u201cReminds me of how my mother used to ask if we were raised in a barn when we forgot our place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, your mom\u2019s a bitch.\u201d The words flew out before Carmine even registered them. \u201cShit, I mean, some people are raised in barns, so that\u2019s not nice manners in itself, you know?\u201d</p><p>Corrado stared at him, his gaze so severe Carmine started sweating. Vincent simply smirked, amused about the situation. Carmine wanted to tell him there was nothing funny about this, but he didn\u2019t dare open his mouth. It was clear he was capable of saying things he shouldn\u2019t say.</p><p>\u201cI believe that\u2019s the point I was trying to make before you interrupted with commentary on my mother,\u201d Corrado said. \u201cCorrect me if I\u2019m wrong, but your girlfriend\u2019s one of those people, and she has a lot better manners than you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou learn to fake respect for people when they threaten your life, whether you want to be polite or not,\u201d Carmine said. \u201cI\u2019d venture to guess half the time Haven says, \u2018yes, sir,\u2019 she\u2019s really screaming inside, \u2018fuck you, asshole.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to initiate someday, Carmine?\u201d Corrado asked.</p><p>The sudden shift in topic caught him off guard. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStalling is unnecessary. You react impulsively, so just answer. Do you want to be initiated?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d</p><p>Corrado cut him off, his voice sharp. \u201cThat\u2019s right, you don\u2019t think. And you\u2019re in for a rude awakening if you intend to join the life, because all that you said about respecting those you\u2019d rather not because of the hold they have on your life? That applies to all of us. If we forget our place, we get a bullet. So if the answer to my question is yes, I advise you to take a few pointers from that girl who was raised in the barn and learn to at least act respectfully toward those you may not respect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Carmine said. Corrado\u2019s eyes narrowed at his response, and he realized it sounded like he was trying to be difficult. \u201cI mean the answer is no.\u201d</p><p>Corrado motioned toward Vincent. \u201cContinue then.\u201d</p><p>Vincent took a deep breath. \u201cWe need to talk about what you saw in my safe.\u201d</p><p>Carmine wasn\u2019t sure if he wanted to hear the truth spoken out loud, but he motioned for his father to continue. For the next twenty minutes, Vincent rattled on about underground wars and all of the lives that had been destroyed, the devastation evident once the smoke cleared. Although Carmine wasn\u2019t surprised, the words still managed to make his hair stand on end. \u201cShe\u2019s Mafia royalty?\u201d</p><p>Vincent nodded.</p><p>\u201cDo you understand the seriousness of the situation?\u201d Corrado asked. \u201cAlthough your father means well, he\u2019s doing the same thing Frankie did\u2014he\u2019s knowingly holding Mafiosi blood in his possession. I\u2019m going to do everything I can to contain this, but there\u2019s a chance it\u2019ll be exposed. And when that happens, we\u2019re all going to be in danger . . . especially you and her.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy us especially?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause your father and I would be killed, Carmine,\u201d Corrado said. \u201cYou\u2019d become pawns.\u201d</p><p>He was quiet, letting it all sink in. \u201cSomething doesn\u2019t make sense to me. Why would Frankie risk his life keeping the kid? Why not sell Haven? He didn\u2019t care about her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t know for certain,\u201d Corrado said, \u201cbut Monica Antonelli wasn\u2019t stable. She was, uh . . .\u201d He waved his hand as if to think of a word. \u201c. . . fuori come un balcone. It was the reason they moved to the desert. Rest, they called it. Rehabilitation from a mental breakdown, but she never recovered. I think Frankie took advantage of an unfortunate situation to try to help his wife. No one would ever suspect it, and he lived so far away she wouldn\u2019t be seen by anyone who could recognize her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPlus, no one keeps small children for labor,\u201d Vincent added. \u201cYou can\u2019t have a toddler washing dishes or cooking meals. No one would\u2019ve considered she had been sold and not killed because of that. Child slaves end up one place, and they may have broken conduct and murdered innocents, but some things were still off limits to us all.\u201d</p><p>Carmine sighed. He had a lot to think about. \u201cIs that all? Can I go?\u201d</p><p>Corrado snickered. \u201cHe may barge in, but at least he has enough sense to wait to be dismissed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot always,\u201d Vincent said. \u201cSometimes he just walks out.\u201d</p><p>The next morning, Haven made breakfast while Carmine sat off to the side, watching her. She\u2019d have moments where she was herself, laughing and being playful, but as soon as Corrado came near, it slipped away. She moved around him like there was magnetic polarity, always keeping a certain amount of distance from him.</p> <p>It reminded Carmine of his mom, that fact not helping to brighten his mood. Nostalgic, the sorrow and longing crept in, bringing him down. It wasn\u2019t his graduation and he felt cheated.</p><p>Carmine filled a flask with vodka before they set off for the school. He pulled the Mazda into the parking lot and got out as Haven nervously looked around. \u201cRelax, hummingbird. We\u2019re only here to help my brother bid high school farewell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t want to embarrass you.\u201d</p><p>He put his arm around her. \u201cYou\u2019ll never embarrass me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I fall down the stairs in front of everyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t be walking down any stairs.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t need stairs. What if I just fall?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t. I\u2019ll hold you up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I take you down with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think you can take me down?\u201d he asked playfully. \u201cI guess I fall, then. Hate to break it to you, but that won\u2019t embarrass me.\u201d</p><p>She huffed. \u201cWhat if I get hiccups and interrupt graduation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that happens, I\u2019ll probably laugh, but whatever. You still aren\u2019t gonna embarrass me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what if . . .\u201d</p><p>By the time Haven was done asking her questions, they were safely seated in the back of the auditorium. Everyone settled and the ceremony started, the graduating class making their way in. Haven watched with wide eyes. As ridiculous as it all was to him, it was significant to her. She\u2019d never gotten to experience high school.</p> <p>Carmine didn\u2019t know what to say, so he just sat quietly and watched as Principal Rutledge blabbed about how proud he was. Usually Carmine blocked out the inspirational bullshit they spewed, but Haven listened with so much passion it made him want to know what she was hearing.</p><p>\u201cTake a second to imagine your future,\u201d the valedictorian said when she stepped to the podium. \u201cImagine your life\u2014your job, your spouse, your kids\u2014but don\u2019t imagine the future you think you\u2019re heading for. Forget all the expectations and concentrate on what you truly want. Visualize the road that will take you there. That\u2019s your path. That\u2019s where you belong.\u201d</p><p>Carmine pulled Haven to him, kissing her hair as she laid her head on his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cNone of the truly great in this world became that way by doing what they felt they had to do. If Isaac Newton had become a farmer like his mother wanted him to, or if Elvis would\u2019ve listened when he was told to stick to truck driving, we\u2019d know neither man today. We know them because they had the courage to follow the path they envisioned.\u201d</p><p>The speech wound down, and Haven drank in every word of it.</p><p>The graduating class threw their caps into the air and everyone filtered out. Haven stood off to the side on the plaza with Tess and Dia as Carmine sat down on the brick wall lining the school. He watched her quietly, absorbing every smile.</p><p>Dominic sat beside him, still wearing his blue gown.</p><p>\u201cCongrats,\u201d Carmine said, pulling out his flask and taking a swig before handing it to his brother.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Dominic took a drink and shuddered. \u201cYou know, Haven looks happy.\u201d</p><p>Carmine nodded, glancing at her. She was laughing at something. \u201cYeah, she does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s changed a lot these past nine months. She\u2019s not the same frightened girl who showed up the first day. She\u2019s smart, too. I\u2019m graduating, and she corrected my vocabulary the other day. I said I felt nauseous, and she said the word I wanted was nauseated. Fucked me up, bro. Didn\u2019t know there was a difference.\u201d</p><p>He smirked. \u201cSounds like something she\u2019d do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t flinch anymore, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hated the flinching.\u201d</p><p>They passed the flask back and forth before Dominic spoke again. \u201cIt was her, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d Carmine nodded and Dominic sighed, handing the flask back. \u201cI figured. You got this look on your face at the family meeting, like she wrecked your car or something. It was the only thing that made sense.\u201d</p><p>Carmine took a deep breath, feeling guilty he had blamed her. He still sometimes had moments where knowing the truth was hard. It would always hurt, but it was a pain he\u2019d learn to live with.</p><p>\u201cI think Mom would be happy to see her,\u201d Dominic said. \u201cTo see how much she\u2019s changed. I guess that\u2019s what she wanted, and you did that for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d</p><p>Dominic laughed. \u201cThe hell you didn\u2019t. You think that\u2019s Dad\u2019s doing? He brought her here, but you made the difference. Mom always said you\u2019d do great things in life, and I see it now, because no matter what you do tomorrow, Carmine, what matters is you did that today.\u201d</p><p>Carmine gazed at Haven as he mulled over his brother\u2019s words. She seemed so relaxed, so at ease, so much like a regular girl. Just looking at her, laughing and chatting, it was hard to imagine she\u2019d been through the things she\u2019d endured. \u201cAll I did was love her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEver think maybe that\u2019s what she needed? Sometimes we don\u2019t have to really do anything. We have to just be.\u201d</p><p>They sat there until the flask was empty. Carmine slipped it into his pocket as Dominic stood. \u201cYou know what\u2019s kind of funny? Well, not funny, but ironic, maybe? She\u2019s been here nine months now, and it takes nine months to create life. It\u2019s like she\u2019s been reborn.\u201d</p><p>Dominic walked away but paused after a few steps, his brow furrowed. \u201cActually, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s irony. Haven would probably correct me again and say I was being symbolic.\u201d</p><p>Carmine chuckled. \u201cOr metaphoric.\u201d</p><p>35</p><p>A shiver ran the length of Carmine\u2019s body, causing his muscles to grow taut. Haven stared at his sleeping form for a while, watching the rise and fall of his chest as he breathed. There was a stirring inside of her, warmth starting deep inside her chest. It frightened her, yet it made her feel like she was floating on air.</p><p>It was hope.</p><p>Haven grabbed the blanket and covered Carmine before climbing out of bed. She dressed, giving him one last look before heading downstairs to the kitchen. She pulled out the ingredients for an Italian cream cake and had the batter together when subtle footsteps echoed behind her. They were restrained, the steps of someone trying to go undetected.</p><p>But Haven noticed.</p><p>Her hands shook as she scooped the batter into pans, attempting to ignore the presence. She put the cake into the oven and set the timer. A cold chill ran the length of Haven\u2019s spine when Corrado finally spoke, his voice quiet and flat. \u201cGood morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Mr. Moretti,\u201d she said, turning to look at him. He was dressed in a black suit, his jacket open and hands in his pockets. \u201cCan I get you something?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t move, his stance so statuesque she wondered if he was even breathing. \u201cNo,\u201d he said finally, the word echoing in the tense silence.</p><p>She resumed making the frosting as he moved toward her. Instinctively, she took a step away. If Katrina had taught her anything, it was to stay out of the way whenever possible.</p><p>Corrado grabbed a bottle of water and stood off to the side, watching some more. Dr. DeMarco walked in after a few minutes and gave Corrado a curious look before his eyes found their way to her. \u201cGood morning, dolcezza.\u201d</p><p>She breathed a sigh of relief at the kindness in his voice. \u201cGood morning, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised to see you awake so early today,\u201d he said. \u201cI take it Carmine\u2019s still asleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>The timer for the oven went off. Haven pulled out the cake layers as Dr. DeMarco stood near her, gazing out the window with a wistful expression. The sun was rising, lighting up the driveway and the thick forest surrounding the property.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll be here soon,\u201d he said, his attention shifting to the cake. \u201cItalian cream cake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI made it for Carmine\u2019s birthday.\u201d</p><p>Irritation flashed across his face.</p><p>\u201cFascinating, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Corrado asked from across the room. \u201cI\u2019ve never felt such a strong sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu before.\u201d</p><p>Dr. DeMarco clenched his teeth, turning his gaze outside. \u201cWhen you finish, child, I need you to make sure Carmine\u2019s awake. I\u2019d go myself, but something tells me he\u2019s probably not decent.\u201d</p><p>He stressed the word decent. Haven\u2019s cheeks flushed. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>Corrado laughed. \u201cI\u2019m quite sure this is one of those times Carmine was referring to, Vincent.\u201d</p><p>Dr. DeMarco shook his head and left the kitchen, while Corrado lingered. \u201cWhen you wake Carmine, tell him his godfather is coming.\u201d He walked out, muttering, \u201cTale il padre, tale il figlio,\u201d under his breath.</p><p>Teresa Capozzi enjoyed the finer things in life\u2014the fastest foreign cars, the thickest mink furs, and the best vintage Dom Perignon wines. An air of superiority oozed from her pores, her demeanor shaped by her greed. It was well known that Mrs. Capozzi thought of nothing but herself and her next drink. Nobody liked her, not even her husband of forty years, but she didn\u2019t care. Teresa Capozzi didn\u2019t want to be liked; she wanted to be envied.</p><p>Haven watched out the window in the kitchen as the woman stepped out from the passenger seat of the rented Porsche and smoothed her tight black dress. She sauntered toward the house in her high heels, ignoring Salvatore when he tried to take her arm. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The closer Teresa got, the better Haven could make out her features. The woman looked as if she were made out of plastic, her face expressionless and coated in heavy makeup. Her body was disproportionate, every part of her tucked and tweaked.</p><p>Dr. DeMarco greeted the couple as Celia made drinks, ignoring Haven again when she told her she could handle it. Haven threw together a cherry Coke for Carmine, spiking it with a little vodka. They carried the glasses into the family room, and Haven\u2019s anxiety grew as she approached their guests. She handed a glass of scotch to Salvatore, her hand shaking from nerves.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to see you again,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou too, sir,\u201d she said, avoiding his gaze. Haven handed a glass of some orange liqueur to his wife. \u201cHere you go, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p> <p>Teresa took it, bringing it to her nose and inhaling. \u201cThis isn\u2019t made right,\u201d she said, thrusting it toward her and spilling some on the floor. The room went instantly silent.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Haven said as she took the drink back.</p><p>She turned around and nearly collided with Celia, who grabbed the glass from her hand. \u201cI must be losing my touch. I thought I made it perfectly.\u201d</p><p>Teresa glanced between Celia and Haven. \u201cI must\u2019ve been mistaken,\u201d she conceded, reaching for the glass again and taking a sip. \u201cPerfect as usual, Celia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought so,\u201d she said, a hint of amusement in her voice. \u201cWe all make mistakes.\u201d</p> <p>The expression on Teresa\u2019s face said she didn\u2019t agree.</p><p>Celia took a seat across the room, and Corrado sat down on the arm beside her. Haven handed the cherry Coke to Carmine and started to move away, but he pulled her into his lap and wrapped a protective arm around her. Teresa coughed as she choked on her drink, her eyes shifting to Dr. DeMarco as she let out a bitter laugh.</p><p>\u201cTeresa,\u201d Salvatore warned, but she simply smiled as he turned his attention to Carmine. \u201cI\u2019m afraid we won\u2019t be able to stay long, Principe. We have a flight for a vacation in Florida, but I had to take a detour to wish you a happy birthday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate it,\u201d Carmine said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not every day my godson turns eighteen. This is a big deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t seem that way.\u201d</p> <p>Salvatore laughed. \u201cOh, but it is. Do you have any plans this summer?\u201d</p><p>Carmine\u2019s grip on Haven tightened, but his voice showed no sign of distress. \u201cFootball camp. Other than that, we\u2019ll probably just hang out before my brother leaves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd after summer\u2019s over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure senior year will be kicking my ass for a while.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore raised his eyebrows. \u201cAnd after you graduate?\u201d</p><p>Carmine remained silent for a moment. \u201cCollege, I guess.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore\u2019s smile diminished. He glanced at Dr. DeMarco as if he expected him to speak up, but he didn\u2019t say a word. \u201cAnd the girl?\u201d Salvatore asked, his gaze shifting to Haven. \u201cI\u2019m curious what your family intends to do with her. Given the situation, I gather you don\u2019t plan to let her be sold.\u201d</p><p>Carmine\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cOf course not.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d Salvatore echoed. \u201cAnd after you\u2019re gone for college, your father won\u2019t want to live here alone with her. Just think of the gossip. I\u2019m sure the rumors are already aplenty.\u201d</p><p>Dr. DeMarco cleared his throat. \u201cI\u2019ve been weaning her to the world, so she can join it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s noble of you, Vincent, but I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s wise,\u201d Salvatore said. \u201cShe must know quite a bit. How can we be sure anything she\u2019s seen or heard won\u2019t be disclosed to anyone?\u201d</p><p>Dr. DeMarco glanced at her. \u201cI\u2019ll vouch for her.\u201d</p><p>His words were met with a vicious laugh from Salvatore. \u201cAfter what happened when . . . well, you know . . . I don\u2019t think your opinion can be taken at face value on this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the same,\u201d Dr. DeMarco said.</p><p>\u201cYes, it is, Vincent. You know the dangers and risks. You can\u2019t let her loose without someone taking responsibility for her, and you\u2019re in no frame of mind to do it.\u201d</p><p>It sickened Haven to have her fate being discussed as if she weren\u2019t there, but equally as shocked that Dr. DeMarco intended to let her go. She couldn\u2019t fathom why the man would go through the trouble of paying for her if he planned to let her walk away.</p><p>\u201cMaybe she should come with me,\u201d Salvatore said. \u201cShe\u2019d be taken care of in my home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way,\u201d Carmine said. \u201cIf you need someone to take responsibility for her, I will.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore shook his head. \u201cYou can\u2019t do that when you\u2019re not a part of this. Besides, I\u2019m not positive that\u2019s the right course of action.\u201d</p><p>They were at an impasse when another voice chimed in, quiet but forceful. \u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>Everyone\u2019s attention turned to Corrado.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Salvatore asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll vouch for the girl,\u201d he said again.</p><p>Salvatore looked as if he\u2019d been struck. \u201cAre you sure you want to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of want,\u201d Corrado said. \u201cIf it\u2019s necessary, I\u2019ll do it. I trust Vincent when he says she won\u2019t talk, and if she does, I\u2019ll handle her. Simple enough.\u201d</p><p>The guests departed around six in the evening, and Carmine opened presents from his family. Feeling bad for having nothing to give him, Haven watched longingly as others bombarded him with an array of gifts. Afterward, they put on a movie, but Haven couldn\u2019t focus on what was happening.</p><p>About halfway through, she told Carmine she was going upstairs, wanting a moment alone. She headed to her bedroom and climbed into the cold bed. Pulling the blanket over her, she snuggled into a pillow and drifted off to sleep. She was awoken later when the bed shifted, and she blinked a few times as she adjusted to the darkness.</p><p>Carmine slid in beside her. \u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d Her voice was thick with sleep. \u201cWhat time is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMidnight,\u201d he said as she snuggled up to him. He was warm and smelled like a mixture of cologne and smoke. \u201cWe watched Scarface. Go figure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s nice,\u201d she said, although Scarface sounded like a horror movie to her. It reminded her of monsters, and a flicker of hers flashed in her mind. She squeezed her eyes shut tightly to ward off the image of mangled skin. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I couldn\u2019t get you anything for your birthday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have all I need, Haven. We can be together now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid they really mean that stuff about me?\u201d</p><p>Carmine buried his face in her hair. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>The confirmation sent her emotions surging. \u201cIt\u2019s that easy?\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t call it easy. The hard part is ahead of us. But you\u2019ll be able to do whatever now: go to school, marry me, make a houseful of babies if that\u2019s what you want. Could leave my ass, too, if you wanna do that.\u201d</p><p>She was stunned he\u2019d think that. \u201cI\u2019ll never leave you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good to hear, colibri. I\u2019m just saying you could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does it mean when someone vouches for you, anyway?\u201d</p><p>He said nothing. Sleep nearly took Haven under as she figured he wasn\u2019t coherent enough to answer. He finally spoke, though, his voice barely loud enough for her to hear. \u201cIt means they guarantee your loyalty. Slaves aren\u2019t the only ones who pay for others\u2019 mistakes, Haven. Corrado just swore if you made one, he\u2019d pay for it with his life.\u201d</p><p>She blanched. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want anyone to get hurt because of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCorrado knows what he\u2019s doing,\u201d he said. \u201cYou may not trust them, but you gotta trust me when I say this is the only way, baby. It\u2019s the only way you can be free.\u201d</p><p>Free. She once looked up the word in the thesaurus Carmine had given her and memorized the words on the page: unrestrained, emancipated, independent, individualistic, liberated, self-directing, self-governing, self-ruling; antonym: bound, enslaved. That had been her\u2014enslaved\u2014but not anymore. Now, because of Carmine, she knew what the word free meant, and soon, she realized, she could know how it felt.</p><p>36</p><p>Carmine was in a fog as he dragged himself out of bed the next day. After washing the sweat and grime from his body, he gazed at his reflection in the mirror. He desperately needed a haircut and a shave, but otherwise he looked like the same Carmine DeMarco. Same person he had seen every day for years, but he didn\u2019t feel the same anymore. It wasn\u2019t because he was older or wiser\u2014far from it. It was because of her.</p><p>He smiled when he saw Haven in the library, her fingertips grazing the spines of a row of books. She pulled one off a shelf, her brow furrowing as she studied the front cover. He chuckled at her expression, and her eyes snapped in his direction. \u201cI didn\u2019t hear you come out of your room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t the only one who knows how to be quiet, Ninja.\u201d</p><p>She replaced the book on the shelf. \u201cHmm, well, maybe we should get you a bell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, at least I don\u2019t almost give you heart attacks. You used to startle the hell out of me. I thought for sure you\u2019d need to give me CPR a few times.\u201d</p><p>She raised her eyebrows. \u201cDon\u2019t be so sure. You make my heart race every time you come near me.\u201d</p><p>He strolled over to where she stood and leaned down to kiss her. He nipped at her bottom lip as he pulled back, pressing his palm against her chest. \u201cHow\u2019s the heart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFeels like it\u2019s going to explode.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s strong; it\u2019s not gonna break.\u201d</p><p>Her smile fell. \u201cPromise?\u201d</p><p>Carmine stared at her, confused by her sudden shift in demeanor, when it struck him what he\u2019d said. \u201cPromise. I\u2019ll do whatever it takes to make sure it continues to beat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what are you doing in the library?\u201d</p><p>She turned around, scanning the books again. \u201cI was looking for something to read. I feel like I should learn something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get out of school for the summer, and you decide it\u2019s time to learn? That\u2019s kinda backward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but if I\u2019m going to be free, I shouldn\u2019t be stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t stupid, but there\u2019s nothing wrong with learning. If you wanna learn, I\u2019m all for it. Actually, you know what? I have an idea.\u201d</p><p>Grabbing her hand, she offered no resistance as he pulled her toward the steps. Once they reached Vincent\u2019s office on the second floor, Carmine grabbed the knob but hesitated. He knocked instead, and Corrado opened it, stepping to the side so they could enter. Haven stiffened as she took a seat, looking at Carmine nervously as Corrado walked to the other side of the room.</p><p>\u201cDo you need something?\u201d Vincent asked from behind his desk, his fingers stilled on the keys of his laptop.</p><p>\u201cI wondered how hard it would be to get Haven a GED.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Vincent sat back and pushed his glasses up on his nose. \u201cNow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, not right this damn minute, but soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDepends on what you want it for,\u201d Vincent said. \u201cWe could have one made for her, but it might not pass a strict vetting process.\u201d</p><p>What was the point if she didn\u2019t learn anything? \u201cI\u2019m talking about her earning one.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh. I suppose it wouldn\u2019t be too difficult. She\u2019ll need some documents and a driver\u2019s license for proof of identity, but I can pull some strings and get her the stuff. All you have to do is make sure she\u2019s ready to test.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d That simple? \u201cI wish I would\u2019ve known sooner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get any ideas,\u201d Vincent said. \u201cYou made it this far; you can finish high school. She wasn\u2019t afforded the opportunity, but there\u2019s no reason she can\u2019t test for a GED if she wants one.\u201d</p><p>Haven glanced between them. \u201cGED?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStands for General Education Diploma,\u201d Carmine said. \u201cOr General Equivalency Diploma. I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p> <p>Corrado shook his head. \u201cGeneral Education Development.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever, it could stand for Goddamn Endocrine Disorder for all I care,\u201d Carmine said. \u201cIt means the same thing.\u201d</p><p>Vincent laughed loudly. \u201cYou just wished a hormone deficiency on the girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, we don\u2019t want that,\u201d Carmine said. \u201cI mean a diploma.\u201d</p><p>Haven stared straight ahead. \u201cDiploma?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Carmine said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a piece of paper, but it means you know enough to complete high school. You can get into some colleges with it.\u201d</p> <p>Her eyes widened. \u201cI can get one of those? A GED?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Carmine said.</p><p>\u201cIf you want one,\u201d Vincent said. \u201cIt\u2019s up to you.\u201d</p><p>Haven blinked back tears. The man who controlled her life\u2014her master\u2014just told her something was up to her. She tried to speak, but no sound came out when she opened her mouth, so she nodded instead.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s settled, then,\u201d Vincent said. \u201cI\u2019m sure you can find some practice work online. Anything more and you\u2019ll have to wait for the documents.\u201d</p><p>Vincent turned his attention to his laptop, the conversation over.</p><p>The moment they stepped into the hallway, Haven flung herself at him. Carmine stumbled a few steps but managed to keep his balance as she leaped up and wrapped her legs around his waist. He clung to her tightly so she didn\u2019t fall.</p><p>Haven buried her face in his neck, her hands finding their way into his hair. Carmine was stunned into silence, unable to do anything but stand there and hold her.</p> <p>Carmine pulled the cake out of the fridge when they made it to the kitchen, and Haven watched as he cut a slice for himself. \u201cSo you like the cake?\u201d</p><p>He grabbed a fork. \u201cItalian cream cake\u2019s my favorite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it really?\u201d</p><p>He smirked, taking a bite. \u201cIt is now.\u201d</p><p>Haven laughed as Dominic strolled into the room. \u201cWhoa, I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re eating without me. That\u2019s foul.\u201d</p><p>Shrugging, Carmine hopped up on the counter as Dominic cut a massive piece for himself. Soon the rest of the family joined them, Corrado and Celia getting pieces and standing off to the side while Dr. DeMarco grabbed a bottle of water. He closed the fridge door and turned to look at them, his gaze shifting toward the cake.</p><p>\u201cHave you tried some, Dad?\u201d Dominic asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Dominic cut another slice and slapped it on a plate, holding it out to his father. \u201cYou should.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather not,\u201d Vincent said, eyeing the plate with distaste.</p><p>Dominic shrugged. \u201cYour loss, but I tell you\u2014this is the best cake I\u2019ve ever had. She\u2019s a great cook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Carmine said. \u201cProbably all the Italian in her.\u201d</p><p>He tensed when he realized what he\u2019d said and noticed his father had the same reaction. Vincent opened his water and took a drink as Carmine tried to think of something to say to shift the conversation elsewhere. Before he could, Dominic laughed. \u201cMust be. You know damn well she has Carmine\u2019s full-blooded Italian in her all the time.\u201d</p><p>Vincent coughed as he choked on his drink. Celia snorted, trying to hold back her amusement, but Dominic didn\u2019t bother containing himself. The laughter died down as Vincent caught his breath, looking at him with disapproval. Carmine waited for him to say something, but he just walked out.</p><p>After he was gone, they burst into another round of laughter. Haven looked at Carmine with confusion. \u201cI thought you were half-Irish.\u201d</p><p>Carmine opened his mouth to answer but closed it again, shaking his head. There was no way to explain it without embarrassing her.</p><p>Night fell, the house as still as a graveyard. Vincent sat in his office, glaring at the plate on his desk. The small sliver of cake was just enough to taste, but the thought of taking a bite made his stomach churn.</p><p>Maura always made Italian cream cake. It had been her favorite.</p><p>He fingered the small gold band around his neck, his pinky finger barely fitting halfway through it. The metal was startlingly cold against his skin but not as cold as Vincent felt inside.</p><p>After another minute of staring at the cake, he picked up the plate and tossed it into the trash. It hit the bottom of the empty wastebasket with a loud clank, and Vincent didn\u2019t give it another thought. He slipped the necklace under the neckline of his shirt again, concealing it, and picked up a stack of papers on his desk.</p><p>X-rays, consultations, broken bones, stitches. Diseases, rashes, infections, viruses. One awful diagnosis after another, but Vincent preferred it to the morose thoughts swimming in his head.</p><p>For as many lives as he\u2019d destroyed, as many people as he\u2019d watched die, there were countless others he\u2019d saved. And as exhausted as he was, somewhere in the mound of files in front of him had to be another patient who could take the sting of death away.</p><p>If only for a little while.</p><p>37</p><p>The warm June weather gave way to a sprawling Carolina heat as July dawned. Triple-digit temperatures seeped into the region, stirring up thunderstorms and intermittent showers every day. Fireflies emerged again, flickering in the night sky, as a sense of contentment settled over Haven.</p><p>She ventured outside with Carmine every day, strolling through the backyard in her bare feet. She climbed trees and chased bugs, picked flowers and ran through sprinklers, and all the while Carmine urged her on. His support became invaluable to her, and Haven couldn\u2019t imagine going a single day without him.</p><p>She\u2019d have to, though. They both knew it.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you gonna be late, bro?\u201d Dominic asked as he walked into the family room, where the two of them sat. Haven sighed exasperatedly, having asked that same question a moment ago. She had been trying to get Carmine to leave for the past thirty minutes, but he wouldn\u2019t budge.</p><p>Carmine slouched down. \u201cI\u2019m not going.\u201d</p><p>Dominic laughed. \u201cScared you\u2019ll get hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not afraid,\u201d Carmine said.</p><p>\u201cThen quit whining and go.\u201d</p><p>Carmine grumbled incoherently, still not appearing like he had any intention of moving. He was scheduled to attend football camp for a week in Chapel Hill. He\u2019d been fine with going away and talked incessantly about what he would do when he was there, and she had listened, although she didn\u2019t know what encroachment or interference or any of that other stuff meant. She was just grateful he was sharing something with her.</p><p>But this morning, when Haven opened her eyes, there was no smile on Carmine\u2019s lips. None of the excitement was present anymore. All she saw was her own anxiety reflecting back to her.</p><p>\u201cYou have to go,\u201d she said at the same time he uttered the words he had been repeating all morning: \u201cI\u2019m not going.\u201d</p><p>He pretended to be interested in the television, but she could see his eyes drifting to the clock. Time was running out. He was supposed to be at the University of North Carolina by five to check in and it was already past one.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll still be here when you get back.\u201d</p><p>His eyes snapped in her direction. \u201cOf course you will. Where else would you be?\u201d</p><p>She sighed\u2014that was the wrong thing to say.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about her, man,\u201d Dominic said, walking up behind them. \u201cI have plans for her this week. I\u2019m going to keep her so busy she won\u2019t even realize you\u2019re gone.\u201d</p><p>Haven smiled but didn\u2019t believe his words.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll get her in more trouble than she could ever find on her own,\u201d Carmine said. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s why I\u2019m not going.\u201d</p><p>Dominic laughed. \u201cIf you aren\u2019t going, you must not trust her.\u201d</p><p>Anger flashed across his face. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfraid she can\u2019t hack it without you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know she can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why aren\u2019t you going?\u201d</p><p>Carmine glared at him but didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>The front door opened, and Dr. DeMarco paused in the entrance to the family room. \u201cI thought you\u2019d be gone by now,\u201d he said, focusing his attention on Carmine. \u201cAren\u2019t you going to be late?\u201d</p><p>Carmine\u2019s expression softened into a pout. \u201cWould you people get off my nuts? I\u2019ll go in a minute.\u201d</p><p>Dr. DeMarco walked away while Dominic punched Carmine on the shoulder. \u201cThat\u2019s it, be a man! The sooner you leave, the sooner Haven and I can start having fun.\u201d</p><p>Carmine rubbed his arm but once again didn\u2019t respond to his brother. Dominic walked out, and Carmine pulled Haven to him. \u201cI\u2019d hide you in my suitcase and take you with me if I could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Go do some field goals and play some runs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the quarterback, tesoro. I don\u2019t kick field goals. And it\u2019s running plays, not playing runs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Well, go quarterback.\u201d</p><p>He laughed and let go of her. \u201cDon\u2019t let that cafone make you do anything you don\u2019t wanna do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. It\u2019s only a week, so I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d She wasn\u2019t sure who she was reassuring more with her words, him or herself.</p><p>He ran his fingertips across her cheek, and kissed her one final time before standing. \u201cI\u2019ll see you later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood-bye, Carmine,\u201d she said, the words making his steps falter as his shoulders tensed. She thought he was going to turn around and say something to her, but he simply walked out, shaking his head.</p><p>She sat quietly in the family room as he grabbed his stuff and headed for the front door. \u201cYou\u2019re definitely going to be late,\u201d his father said from the foyer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going. Isn\u2019t that enough?\u201d</p><p>Carmine\u2019s bedroom was quiet that night without his presence. Haven tiptoed inside and snatched his favorite pillow off his bed before running to her room. She crawled into bed and snuggled with it. His familiar scent lingered, surrounding her like a warm shroud.</p><p>Haven closed her eyes and pleaded for sleep to come quickly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The next morning, a loud banging ricocheted through the room, and Haven jumped out of bed as Dominic\u2019s voice carried through the door. \u201cRise and shine!\u201d</p><p>She glanced at the clock\u2014a few minutes past seven. She pulled open the door when Dominic knocked again, and he grinned brightly, raising his eyebrows. \u201cToo tired to get changed last night?\u201d</p><p>She glanced down and realized she still had her clothes on from the day before. \u201cI didn\u2019t think about it. Why are you up early?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m starving! Breakfast is in order.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid you want me to make you something?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cOf course not. Damn, girl, are you awake yet? Do you really think I\u2019d drag you out of bed so you could cook? We\u2019re going out for breakfast . . . just you and me.\u201d</p><p>Crossroads Diner was packed when they arrived, and much to the dismay of some waiting patrons, Dominic got a table right away. Looking through the menu, Haven ordered French toast while Dominic rattled off a list of eggs, bacon, sausage, pancakes, fruit, and toast. She wasn\u2019t surprised because she was used to feeding him, but he smiled sheepishly anyway. \u201cWhat can I say? I\u2019m a growing boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re done growing, Dom.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, pushing up his shirtsleeve and flexing his weak muscle. \u201cI need fuel, though. These guns are the only ones I carry and they don\u2019t come naturally, little sis.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLittle sis,\u201d she said, echoing his words.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said. \u201cSomeday you might make it official by marrying my shithead little brother.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at the thought.</p><p>The waitress returned with their food, and the two of them ate. Despite the fact that the place was noisy, a comfortable silence surrounded their table.</p><p>\u201cDid you ever think it would be this way?\u201d Dominic asked after a few minutes.</p><p>\u201cWhat way?\u201d</p> <p>He waved his fork in the air, motioning all around them. \u201cThis way. Coming here, having a life, getting a family, meeting Carmine. All of it, really. Did you ever think this would happen?\u201d</p><p>She contemplated his question as he took a bite of food. \u201cMy mama said I\u2019d end up somewhere like this, but I figured I was given the life I had so the most I could do was get used to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can relate,\u201d Dominic said. \u201cDid you know I was adopted?\u201d</p><p>She was caught off guard. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am. My real mom . . . well, no, Maura was my real mom in every way that counted. The woman who birthed me was raped, and out I popped.\u201d</p><p>Haven\u2019s mouth dropped open. \u201cI was made the same way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured,\u201d he said. \u201cSee, you and I aren\u2019t that different. None of us are when it comes down to it. The only difference is my mom stumbled upon me at the right time and saved me from what could\u2019ve been a disaster. I wonder all the time where I\u2019d be if they hadn\u2019t taken me in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got lucky.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI did,\u201d he said. \u201cYou and Carmine aren\u2019t that different, either. My brother\u2019s a spoiled little shit\u2014that\u2019s why he\u2019s picky. Everyone always catered to him. Not saying I was neglected, because I wasn\u2019t, but Carmine received the kind of attention I never had to deal with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of attention?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAttention from, uh . . . Dad\u2019s friends.\u201d He glanced around to see if anyone was listening. \u201cAt my christening when I was a kid, there were about two dozen people. It was relaxed, a potluck at the house. Carmine\u2019s christening was a few months after mine, and hundreds of people came to show their respect. It had to be catered and held in a reception hall.\u201d</p><p>Haven frowned. \u201cThat\u2019s horrible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m sure I was jealous then, but I don\u2019t envy my brother. Before he could walk or talk, people were making plans for his future. I\u2019m grateful I never had that kind of pressure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy him?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhy not you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he\u2019s Dad\u2019s son, a DeMarco, and that\u2019s what they care about\u2014the Italian blood.\u201d He paused. \u201cOr what they used to care about. I don\u2019t know anymore. But anyway, to what I was saying. Carmine\u2019s spoiled, but deep down he\u2019s still a terrified little boy, trying to figure out where he belongs, just like you\u2019re that girl looking for her place in the world. You two were searching for the same thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd my mom would\u2019ve called that fate.\u201d</p><p>After leaving the diner, Dominic stopped by the Harper residence to pick up Tess. She threw a duffel bag into the back of the car and crossed her arms over her chest, her usual scowl on her face as she sat in the backseat in total silence.</p><p>Once they reached the house, Tess thrust a shopping bag at Haven. \u201cIt\u2019s a swimsuit.\u201d</p><p>She was taken aback. A gift? \u201cThank you, but I don\u2019t need one.\u201d</p><p>Tess looked amused. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to the lake with me, honey, you do need one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLake?\u201d Haven asked. \u201cWhat lake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re heading down to Aurora Lake for the day,\u201d Dominic said. \u201cIt\u2019ll be a blast.\u201d</p><p>Haven glanced at the bag. \u201cAnd I\u2019m supposed to wear this?\u201d</p><p>Tess nodded. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Haven went straight upstairs to her room and stripped out of her clothes, leaving them in a pile on the floor. The swimsuit was a black one-piece that tied around the neck, the bottom cut like shorts. Haven put it on and tied it the best she could, tugging at it to make sure she was covered.</p><p>Aurora Lake was located in a valley ten minutes south of the Durante city limits. The community of Aurora surrounded it, a few hundred residents living along the twenty-seven miles of shoreline. Although the lake was man-made, much of the land beyond the homes remained untouched.</p><p>Haven climbed out of the car and spotted the water in the distance. It went as far as she could see, wildly tall trees bordering it on all sides. Despite its enormity, something about the place put her at ease. Beyond the grassy lot they had parked on was tan sand, reminding her of the desert ground she\u2019d been used to all her life.</p><p>\u201cWelcome to paradise . . . or as close as we get around here,\u201d Dominic said, juggling some lounge chairs under his right arm. They headed toward the water, setting up on the sand in an area partially encased in shade. There wasn\u2019t a cloud in sight, and the warm summer breeze felt nice on Haven\u2019s skin.</p><p>Dominic set out into the water while Tess stripped out of her clothes. Haven pulled hers off carefully and sat down, watching the few people who were already playing out on the lake. Someone started a game of volleyball after a few minutes, and Dominic and Tess joined the game while Haven relaxed under the sun\u2019s rays.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take long for the temperature to rise, sweat trickling down Haven\u2019s face. She grabbed a bottle of water from the cooler and took a drink when a familiar voice rang out. She coughed, gasping for air as the liquid went down her windpipe.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d she sputtered, coming face-to-face with Nicholas. She took a deep breath that burned her chest. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>He stared at her as he plopped down in Tess\u2019s lounge chair, kicking out his feet and getting comfortable. \u201cI said I didn\u2019t think Carmine would let you come down here.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. \u201cWe\u2019ve been through this. He doesn\u2019t tell me what to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said. \u201cThen I\u2019m surprised you would come here when he can\u2019t. You know, because of trying to kill me and all.\u201d</p><p>That hadn\u2019t crossed her mind. \u201cThis is where you live?\u201d</p><p>Nicholas pointed behind them at a white two-story house about a hundred yards away. It stuck out among the others, the paint fresher. \u201cThat would be my place, so technically speaking, you\u2019re sitting in my yard right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, well, he didn\u2019t try to kill you,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was a misunderstanding.\u201d</p><p>He laughed dryly. \u201cA misunderstanding? He\u2019s seriously clouded your judgment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, your judgment\u2019s clouded. Carmine made mistakes, but he\u2019s a good person. You shouldn\u2019t sit there and pretend you\u2019re innocent. It\u2019s stupid! I wasn\u2019t there and I know you\u2019re both being ridiculous about this . . . this . . . rivalry thing. So get over yourself, because you can\u2019t talk about him like that to me. I love him.\u201d</p><p>She stood and stomped away.</p><p>\u201cHaven, wait,\u201d Nicholas called out as she walked to the edge of the water. She heard him behind her but didn\u2019t acknowledge him. \u201cLook, I just have a hard time believing he cares about anyone. I don\u2019t like the idea of him taking advantage of your situation.\u201d</p><p>She glared at him when he stopped beside her. \u201cYou know nothing about my situation! Carmine\u2019s supportive of me, so how dare you judge him when he\u2019s braver than you\u2019ll ever be!\u201d</p><p>Nicholas stared out at the lake. \u201cSo, uh . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it,\u201d she said. \u201cNo more about Carmine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to say anything about him,\u201d he said. \u201cI was going to ask if you were getting in the water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. No.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t swim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to swim to get your feet wet.\u201d Nicholas pulled off his shirt and tossed it onto the sand. He took a few steps into the water, stopping to look at her when it reached his knees. \u201cWhat are you waiting for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me.\u201d She let out a sharp, cynical laugh the moment the words came from his lips, and he immediately backtracked. \u201cOkay, don\u2019t trust me. But do you really think I\u2019m stupid enough to let you get hurt? I told you before\u2014you\u2019re nice and all, but I don\u2019t plan to die over you. And I guarantee, if you drown, they\u2019ll kill me.\u201d</p><p>Haven stood there for a moment longer before taking a few steps into the lake, her bare feet sinking into the soft earth. She stopped before the water reached her waist.</p><p>\u201cSo why is six afraid of seven?\u201d Nicholas asked, breaking the tension with a joke.</p><p>She held her hands on the surface of the water. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause seven, eight, nine.\u201d He smirked. \u201cGet it? Seven ate nine.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI get it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t laugh. You never laugh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t funny.\u201d</p><p>He let out a heavy sigh. \u201cWhy did the boy throw his toast out the window?\u201d She shrugged. \u201cHe wanted to see the butter fly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee the butter fly?\u201d The joke dawned on her when the words came out. \u201cOh, like a butterfly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, a butterfly. Why did the guy get fired from the orange juice factory?\u201d Another shrug. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t concentrate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike the orange juice that\u2019s made from concentrate?\u201d</p><p>He ran his hands down his face. \u201cYou\u2019re hard to crack, you know. I\u2019ve never failed at making someone laugh before. I may as well have asked why the chicken crossed the road.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy did the chicken cross the road?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo get to the other side, of course.\u201d She smiled at that one, and he threw up his hands. \u201cWell, damn. You\u2019ve never heard that before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need more comedy in your life. Carmine drained you of a sense of humor.\u201d</p> <p>Before she could say anything, he disappeared under the water, and a splash flew in her direction. He resurfaced, and she groaned. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t funny.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas stepped out of the lake and grabbed his shirt. \u201cApparently nothing I say or do is.\u201d</p><p>Haven hesitated but followed behind, not wanting to loiter in the water alone. They strolled over to the lounge chairs. She grabbed a towel while he plopped his wet body down.</p><p>\u201cSo, you guys really are in love? It\u2019s not bullshit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are.\u201d</p> <p>Nicholas grabbed Tess\u2019s purse. Haven watched in shock as he rooted around in it. He pulled out a pen and an old receipt, scribbling something on the back of it.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s my number,\u201d he said, holding it out to her. \u201cYou call me if you ever need anything. I promise to say nothing bad about your boyfriend . . . not a lot, anyway.\u201d</p><p>She took it and read the number. 555\u20130121. \u201cUh, okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a crime to have people to talk to,\u201d he added, standing. \u201cI\u2019ll catch you later, Haven.\u201d</p><p>Once again, at seven in the morning, Haven awoke to Dominic\u2019s insistent pounding. She pulled herself out of bed and trudged over to the door, finding him in the hallway with a grin. \u201cHey, Twinkle Toes. I\u2019m proud you remembered your pajamas this time.\u201d</p><p>The week passed in a repetitious haze, mornings at the diner and afternoons with Dominic and Tess. Dia would occasionally stop by to play a game or watch television, and evenings were Haven\u2019s to do as she pleased. She spent them in the library, reading under the moonlight. She studied relentlessly for the GED, doing practice tests Carmine had printed out for her.</p> <p>Little cooking or cleaning got done, except for the occasional sandwich at dinner or a load of dishes. She felt bad slacking off on her duties, but whenever she attempted to clean, Dominic pulled her away. She was afraid of what Dr. DeMarco would think, but he didn\u2019t seem to notice.</p><p>It was the afternoon of the sixth day when Haven sat in the family room with Dominic, staring at the clock on the wall. She counted the seconds as they ticked by, each one bringing her closer to Carmine\u2019s return.</p><p>\u201cFuck!\u201d</p><p>Pain shot through Carmine\u2019s wrist as his fingers numbed. He shook his hand, trying to get rid of the tingling, as the coach bellowed, \u201cShake it off, DeMarco!\u201d</p><p>Carmine groaned, flexing his fingers. What did it look like he was doing?</p><p>To say he had had a bad week would have been the understatement of the century. Carmine was out of shape, his wrist was sore, and half the team harbored resentment for him for one reason or another. All he wanted to do was play football and go back home, but karma had finally caught up with him.</p><p>And karma was a bigger bitch than Tess Harper.</p><p>The last day of camp had arrived, and Coach Woods had been railing on him since he stepped onto the field that morning. Carmine was close to giving them all the middle finger and strutting away, his irritation to the point of no return.</p> <p>The whistle blew, and Carmine lined up to grab the ball. Taking a few steps back, he looked for the wide receiver and snapped the ball, grinning at the perfect spiral as it soared through the air.</p><p>\u201cWipe that smirk off your face, DeMarco,\u201d Coach Woods said. \u201cThere\u2019s no room for your ego on the field.\u201d</p><p>Mistake after mistake was made in their scrimmage, balls fumbled and throws missed more times than Carmine could count. He got sacked more than once, pain radiating through his back as Coach Woods berated them for their incompetence. After the final whistle blew, signifying the end of camp, the coach called Carmine\u2019s name and clapped him on the shoulder. \u201cYou played well today.\u201d</p><p>Carmine just stood there. He hadn\u2019t expected to hear those words.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hard on you because you have potential,\u201d the coach said. \u201cIt might not be appropriate for me to say this, but the UNC coaches were watching and expressed some interest in you.\u201d</p><p>His mouth dropped open. \u201cNo shit?\u201d</p><p>Instead of chastising him for cursing, the coach laughed. \u201cYes, but they don\u2019t like hotheads, DeMarco. No one does.\u201d</p><p>It was late evening when Carmine reached Durante. He pulled up in front of the house and climbed out, stretching his sore back when the front door swung open. Haven came toward him, leaping off the porch. Their bodies collided, and Carmine stumbled as she buried her face in his chest. He wrapped his arms around her as she looked at him adoringly, a hint of worry in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cYour face,\u201d she said, running her fingers gently across a bruise on his cheek. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>He smirked. \u201cI fell.\u201d</p><p>Rolling her eyes, she reached up on her tiptoes and pressed her lips to his, her hands passionately locking in his hair. When she pulled away for air, Carmine laughed. \u201cIf I\u2019m gonna be greeted like that, maybe I should go away more often.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way! You\u2019re not allowed!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, then.\u201d He pulled her to him tightly. \u201cI fucking missed you, hummingbird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI missed you, too.\u201d</p><p>Haven grabbed his arm and tugged, pulling him inside. Carmine bypassed his father\u2019s office and his brother\u2019s bedroom, foregoing greetings for the time being. \u201cDid you do anything exciting while I was gone?\u201d he asked as they settled into his room.</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cMostly just normal stuff.\u201d</p><p>Normal stuff. Never in his wildest dreams did he think he\u2019d hear those words from her.</p><p>Sitting on the bed, Carmine rubbed his aching back as Haven eyed him suspiciously. She pushed his hand out of the way to massage him, and he moaned involuntarily at her touch. \u201cYou\u2019re too good to me, tesoro.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou always say that, but it\u2019s not like it\u2019s agonizing to touch you,\u201d she said. \u201cSo did you get sackled or something?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cSackled?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that what it\u2019s called when you get knocked down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen everyone else gets knocked down, it\u2019s a tackle. When I do, it\u2019s a sack. Two different things.\u201d He let out a moan as she rubbed his sore muscles. \u201cI had my ass kicked out there this week, but I impressed some of the coaches. They mentioned me playing after high school. I don\u2019t know if I wanna go to school here, but it\u2019s nice to know the option\u2019s there.\u201d</p><p>She continued working on his back. \u201cWhere do you want to go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWherever you wanna go,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m gonna leave that up to you.\u201d</p><p>38</p><p>Haven stood off to the side and fought back the tears welling in her eyes. Everyone gathered in the foyer and chatted animatedly, the excitement palpable as Dominic\u2019s booming laughter rang out above it all, infiltrating Haven\u2019s ears and causing her grip to falter.</p><p>It was a Sunday afternoon at the end of August. Summer was coming to an end when, to Haven, it felt like it had just begun. The past month and a half had been filled with activity: art galleries, museums, aquariums, and zoos. She drove and read, laughed and played, loved and learned, and in the bustle of life, everything else faded away.</p><p>Carmine occasionally had football practice and took her along. There were others there\u2014family, friends, and girlfriends\u2014gathered in groups, but Haven sat off to the side on the bleachers, watching Carmine by herself. He was confident and aggressive on the field, and she told him he made her proud, but he shrugged it off as if it weren\u2019t a big deal. It was, though, because it was his future . . . their future.</p><p>A future that suddenly seemed a bit more real.</p><p>Dominic\u2019s bags were packed and stuffed into the Mercedes out front. He and Tess were boarding a plane in a few hours, and Dr. DeMarco was flying out to help them settle in. They were excited about the changes their lives were undertaking, but Haven dreaded saying good-bye. She had looked up the University of Notre Dame on a map with Carmine\u2019s help, and while only a few inches separated Indiana from Durante, she knew those inches might as well be a lifetime.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get this show on the road,\u201d Dr. DeMarco said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to miss our flight.\u201d</p><p>Haven\u2019s feet left the ground before Dr. DeMarco finished speaking. Dominic lifted her into the air and twirled her around. \u201cI\u2019ll miss you, girl.\u201d</p><p>She laughed and hugged him. \u201cThank you for everything . . . especially that sandwich.\u201d</p><p>He set her on her feet. Reaching into his pocket, he pulled out his keys and carefully took one off. He slipped it into her palm, squeezing her hand tightly around it. \u201cKeep my car safe for me.\u201d</p><p>She gaped at him. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t take it, so you may as well drive it.\u201d</p><p>Final good-byes were exchanged, and Haven felt the tears slipping down her cheeks as they disappeared out the door. Only a few seconds passed before the door flew back open, Dominic peeking his head in again. \u201cOh yeah, Twinkle Toes? Good luck on your test tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>The trip to the city the next morning took an hour. Carmine talked nonstop the entire drive, but Haven heard nothing except her heartbeat thrashing in her ears. They made it to the local community college with time to spare, and Haven headed inside alone, black spots infiltrating her vision as she fought to keep herself together.</p><p>The bright fluorescent lights hanging from the ceiling irritated her eyes. Haven stood in the doorway, taking in the small wooden desks and hard blue plastic chairs. She\u2019d never been inside of a classroom before. People pushed past her, not bothering to apologize, as she hesitantly walked to the big desk at the front. She smiled politely at the instructor, although she felt like she\u2019d be sick. \u201cI\u2019m Haven Antonelli.\u201d</p><p>He checked her name off a list and collected her paperwork before pointing her to a seat. The testing started at eight o\u2019clock on the dot. Haven breezed through the fifty questions on grammar and punctuation, but the second part of the writing test stalled her. She\u2019d practiced a lot by filling her notebooks, but she had never written anything for someone else to read before.</p><p>The instructor announced they had forty-five minutes as Haven read her essay prompt:</p><p>What does it take to be a good parent?</p><p>In your essay, describe the characteristics of a good parent. Use your personal observations, experience, and knowledge.</p><p>Students huffed and pencils scratched against paper as Haven stared at her topic. What did it take? Her father, abusive and malicious, refused to acknowledge he had created her. She suffered years of torture under his care before he had sold her with no regard. If Dr. DeMarco hadn\u2019t come along, she would have ended up at an auction, sold as a sex slave for money to buy whiskey and Cuban cigars.</p><p>Haven\u2019s anger grew as she bit down on her lip. Her mama had the best intentions, even though she was helpless. She hid her for protection and never failed to keep the one thing even Haven had lost over the years\u2014hope. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Haven blinked away tears as memories assaulted her. Twenty minutes had gone by, so she took a deep breath and started writing. She wrote whatever came to her mind as she thought of her mama, how a good parent never gave up and always encouraged their children to dream.</p><p>The instructor called time as Haven put a period on the end of the final sentence. The rest of testing flew by, and they were dismissed at three in the afternoon. The Mazda was waiting in the fire lane with the music blaring, and Haven quietly slipped into the passenger seat.</p><p>Carmine turned his music down as he pulled from the curb. \u201cHow did you do?\u201d</p><p>She smiled softly as he offered her his hand. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p> <p>Neither spoke on the drive back to Durante. When they arrived at the house she went right to the kitchen to make something to eat. Carmine sat on the counter beside the stove and watched her as she cooked. \u201cAre you making enchiladas?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cThey were, uh . . . my mama liked them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooks good,\u201d Carmine said.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can eat and watch a movie or something.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr maybe we\u2019ll play a game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I\u2019m tired, so maybe we\u2019ll go straight to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably won\u2019t even fucking eat.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUh, okay.\u201d</p><p>The room grew silent as Carmine glared at Haven. His shift in demeanor startled her. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d he said. \u201cYou, I\u2019m not sure about. Since I picked you up, you\u2019ve barely said a dozen words and half of them were okay. Did something happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you fail?\u201d He raised his eyebrows. \u201cDid you freak out or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I think I did okay.\u201d She cringed as she said that word again.</p><p>\u201cThen what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just thinking about my mama.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou wanna talk about her?\u201d he asked, his voice quiet and genuine, all traces of frustration melted away. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to keep it to yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but I don\u2019t know what to say. I miss her, and I\u2019ll probably never see her again. I never got to tell her good-bye or that I love her. It hurts to think about, because I used to wonder if we even loved each other, but I realized today Mama did love me. And I love her, but I never told her that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever,\u201d she whispered as Carmine hopped down from the counter to hug her. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t be crying about this to you because you have more reason to grieve. My mama\u2019s alive, and yours is . . .\u201d</p><p>He flinched before she could speak the word. She pulled from his arms and tried to apologize, but he pressed his pointer finger to her lips. \u201cMy mom lived, Haven. She was free to make her choices, and she did just that. She made fucking stupid decisions, and she died because of it. Your mom has never been able to make a decision, so I think you have more to grieve than I do.\u201d</p><p>Sunny Oaks Manor was anything but sunny today. A storm waged outside, rain steadily falling as gusts of wind bent the flimsy trees around the property. Thunder rumbled as lightning lit up the darkened afternoon sky, making it feel like the middle of the night.</p><p>Vincent stood in his mother\u2019s apartment, watching the ambulance parked outside. The EMTs, in their vivid yellow raincoats, loaded the black body bag into the back. Quietly, he made the sign of the cross and whispered a short prayer.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t pray for that old hag,\u201d Gia said, somehow overhearing him without her hearing aides. \u201cIt\u2019s her own fault she\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d The staff said Gertrude died peacefully in her sleep.</p><p>\u201cShe left her window open last week. I tried to warn her, but she wouldn\u2019t listen. That black bird flew in like it owned the place.\u201d</p><p>Vincent sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t think it was the bird, Ma.\u201d</p><p>Gia waved him off. \u201cWhat do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I am a doctor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you quacks never know what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d she said. \u201cYou always want to give people pills and take their blood from them when it\u2019s unnecessary. God doesn\u2019t make mistakes, Vincenzo. People die when they deserve to. You know that.\u201d</p><p>Vincent clenched his hand into a fist at the subtle dig about Maura. \u201cWhat about Dad? Did he deserve it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs many goomahs as your father had? I\u2019m surprised his heart lasted as long as it did.\u201d</p><p>Vincent would never understand his mother\u2019s callousness. Sometimes he wondered why he bothered visiting when she obviously didn\u2019t appreciate his company.</p><p>The ambulance pulled away from Sunny Oaks, and Vincent\u2019s eyes followed it to the corner in the storm. His gaze lingered there, his stomach dropping as he took in the dark SUV parked less than a block away. He hoped he imagined things, but his instincts told him it was no coincidence. He\u2019d only been joking when he suggested they were watching him, but he realized he\u2019d been right. He was being followed.</p><p>\u201cAre you listening to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Vincent admitted, turning to his mother. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not repeating myself for you,\u201d Gia said. \u201cIt\u2019ll suck the breath from my lungs and take time off my life. That\u2019s probably what you want, isn\u2019t it? For me to die? Then I wouldn\u2019t be a burden anymore. Your own mother . . . you treat me like garbage.\u201d</p><p>Vincent sighed exasperatedly. \u201cWhat do you want from me, Ma?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing, Vincenzo. I want nothing.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at his watch, fresh out of patience. \u201cI should go. Dominic and Tess are waiting.\u201d</p><p>Gia narrowed her eyes. \u201cWho are they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know who Dominic is,\u201d he said, trying to keep calm, but he had had about as much of her as he could take. \u201cHe\u2019s your grandson, and Tess is his girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she Italian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she\u2019s American. Scottish heritage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScottish? At least that\u2019s better than the Irish. What about that other boy of yours? Does he have an Italian girl?\u201d</p><p>Vincent walked over to his mother and kissed her forehead, heading toward the door without answering.</p><p>The week flew by in a blur as Haven and Carmine were left alone. It was easy for them to forget during those days, when it was just the two of them, that barriers stood in their way. It seemed so simple, their lives merging fluidly within the confines of the house; but the outside world was closing in on them fast. A black cloud hovered in the distance, threatening to burst, but the problem was they didn\u2019t know when, where, or how it would come down. It could be an inconvenient drizzle or a flood that washed everything away. There was no way to prepare for the storm when they couldn\u2019t predict what would happen when it struck.</p><p>It was Friday afternoon, and they were in the family room watching a movie, their bodies pressed together on the couch, legs entwined as she lay in his arms. His lips wandered down her jaw, his mouth vigorously sucking on the flesh of her neck.</p><p>The sound of Haven\u2019s light moans was cut off abruptly when the alarm beeped and the front door slammed. Panicked, Carmine sat up as his father stormed into the room. Instinctively, he shifted his body protectively in front of Haven\u2019s as Vincent clenched his hands into fists. \u201cMy office. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Carmine asked tentatively as his father walked away.</p><p>\u201cYou.\u201d</p><p>Carmine stood and pulled Haven to her feet. \u201cGo to my room and stay there while I find out what\u2019s happening.\u201d</p><p>Haven followed him upstairs, but his legs were longer and she couldn\u2019t keep up with his stride. Carmine went straight for his father\u2019s office, thrusting the door open without bothering to knock. Vincent was hunched over his laptop, typing furiously away at the keys. \u201cThey\u2019re coming.\u201d</p><p>Carmine\u2019s brow furrowed at the vague statement. \u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEd McMahon and the prize patrol. Who do you think is coming?\u201d</p><p>The mocking tone caught him off guard. \u201cFeds?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish.\u201d Vincent shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s probably only a matter of time before they come knocking, but no . . . we\u2019re not that lucky today. I got a call a few minutes ago that Sal hopped a plane to come here with no warning. I don\u2019t know why, and I have no idea what they want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Vincent opened desk drawers and rifled through files. \u201cI\u2019m hoping it\u2019s unexpected business, but it could be one of you they\u2019re after, so I need you out of here in case. Corrado doesn\u2019t think you should be anywhere without protection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a gun,\u201d Carmine said.</p><p>Vincent\u2019s head shot up. \u201cA lot of good one gun does you as a nobody. They could kill you and no one would know unless you had one of us by your side.\u201d</p><p>Vincent\u2019s phone vibrated against the desk, and he held his hand up to silence Carmine. He answered it formally, his voice as even as possible. \u201cDeMarco speaking . . . Yes, sir . . . I\u2019ll be here.\u201d</p><p>He hung up, tossing the phone down as he eyed his son peculiarly. \u201cPack some bags. We need to get the ball rolling on things.\u201d</p><p>Haven paced the floor in Carmine\u2019s bedroom, listening attentively for noises from below, but her ears were met with silence. No yelling. No screaming. No commotion at all.</p><p>The stillness only served to fuel her imagination as she conjured up wild scenarios\u2014none of them remotely good. Her hands shook, fear coursing through her as a door slammed on the floor below. Footsteps hurried up the stairs as her heart thumped harder, so frenzied she could feel the blood rushing through her.</p><p>The door flung open, slamming the wall with a bang, and Carmine hurried in. He headed straight for his closet and threw things around, tossing two duffel bags onto the bed. \u201cPack some shit.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t move. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to get out of here, Haven.\u201d</p><p>Haven felt woozy. She wanted to ask what was happening, desperately wanted him to explain, but she knew the answer would terrify her. She staggered to the bed and sat down as Carmine ran to her room, Dr. DeMarco\u2019s words echoing through her mind. She had promised she would never run again. She swore she wouldn\u2019t follow Carmine blindly.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you sitting there?\u201d Carmine asked when he returned, his arms full of clothes. Thoughts swirled madly around her mind as he filled both bags and held his hand out to her. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>The moment the words rolled from his tongue, her mind was made up. No matter the consequences, she had to go with him.</p><p>They hurried downstairs and Carmine pulled her onto the porch, not bothering to close the front door in his haste. Unlocking the car doors, he tossed the bags into the back and motioned for her to get in. As soon as they were settled, Carmine started the car and thrust it into gear. The tires spun and gravel sprayed as he sped away from the house.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Haven asked once they got on the highway, her voice cracking and stomach bubbling. \u201cWhy are we running? Did something happen?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe needed to get out of there before they showed up.\u201d</p><p>She gaped at him as they pulled up to a red light in town. \u201cBefore who showed up, Carmine?\u201d</p><p>He stared straight ahead. \u201cThem.\u201d</p><p>Not understanding, Haven followed the trail of his gaze, her eyes falling on four sleek black sedans sitting at the same red light, facing the opposite direction. \u201cAre they . . . ?\u201d she started, unable to finish the question. She\u2019d seen those cars before.</p> <p>\u201cLa Cosa Nostra,\u201d Carmine said, the Italian words flowing beautifully, but the knowledge of what they meant sent a chill down Haven\u2019s spine. Monsters.</p><p>The light turned green, and Carmine drove through the intersection. \u201cYou might wanna get comfortable, because it\u2019s a long drive to California.\u201d</p><p>Intense emotion hit her, stealing the breath from her lungs. \u201cCalifornia?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cWe\u2019re needed in Blackburn.\u201d</p><p>39</p> <p>Carmine glanced at Haven in the passenger seat, frowning at the angle of her neck. She curled up the best she could with the seatbelt on. Reaching over, he brushed some hair out of Haven\u2019s face and tucked it behind her ear. He ran the back of his hand across her cheek, feeling the roughness of the red blotches from crying. She hadn\u2019t said anything about where they were going, but her tears spoke volumes about how she felt.</p><p>They had been on the road for three days, stopping occasionally to catch some sleep, but the majority of the time had been spent in the cramped car. The sky was overcast, the weather growing worse every mile, the constant drizzle turning into a downpour. Carmine slowly navigated the heavy traffic, his nerves on edge as he firmly gripped the steering wheel.</p><p>Haven sensed his unstable mood when she awoke and waited for him to attempt conversation first. \u201cWe\u2019re almost to the state line,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>She stared out her foggy window. \u201cHave you ever been to California?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that I remember,\u201d he said. \u201cI always wanted to, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo they have colleges here?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny I could go to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat kinda classes do you wanna take?\u201d</p><p>\u201cArt, maybe,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m good enough to\u2014\u201d</p><p>He cut her off. \u201cYou are good enough. And yeah, there are plenty of art schools out here.\u201d</p><p>For the first time in days, something other than trepidation shined from her eyes. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cYes, really, but why California?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI like the palm trees.\u201d</p> <p>Her serious tone as she answered caught him off guard. Most people overanalyzed where to go to school, choosing places based on student-teacher ratios, reputations, and sports teams, but she chose a place because of the scenery. He found it amusing, but he wasn\u2019t at all surprised. The little things in life mattered once again.</p><p>\u201cDo they have them in New York?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPalm trees?\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cNo, art schools.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Yeah, of course. Art schools are everywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you ever been there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few times when I was a kid. My father used to go to New York on business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw on Jeopardy! it\u2019s the city that never sleeps.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cSome people call it the city of dreams, too.\u201d</p><p>She gazed at him. \u201cMaybe we could go there to follow our dreams.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d He laughed. \u201cBut I\u2019m pretty sure they don\u2019t have palm trees.\u201d</p><p>The Blackburn city-limit sign was worn and faded, the green paint sandblasted to a dirty gray. The white writing on it was barely legible. Carmine did a double take as they passed by. \u201cDid that say population seventeen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think it was that many,\u201d Haven said. \u201cI ran for hours.\u201d</p><p>Nothing but uninhabited land surrounded the barren highway. \u201cI believe it. We haven\u2019t passed anything for miles.\u201d</p><p>They drove for a few minutes before he spotted something in the distance. He slowed the car, hoping to find a gas station since the gauge hovered near empty. A hotel would be nice too, since his eyes burned from fatigue, but as he neared the structures, his hope diminished. The abandoned shells of buildings looked as though a small gust of wind could knock them down. His hair stood on end as they drove through, an eerie feeling overcoming the car.</p><p>\u201cThis is a ghost town,\u201d he said. \u201cWhere the hell are the people?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe they moved.\u201d</p><p>He laughed dryly. \u201cOr they all died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome did,\u201d she said.</p><p>Her strangled voice told him a story existed behind those words, but it wasn\u2019t the time to ask questions. She looked to be teetering on the brink of a breakdown, and he couldn\u2019t risk pushing her over the edge.</p><p>Carmine continued to drive, passing another city-limit sign. They\u2019d gone from one side of Blackburn to the other without seeing a living soul. The town was an enormous prison cell. There were no bars or chains, no physical restraints, but it was a mass of oblivion cut off from the world. There were no people, no cars, no stores, no houses . . . there wasn\u2019t even any color.</p><p>It was like it didn\u2019t exist.</p><p>Suddenly, so much made sense to Carmine. He knew she had grown up isolated, but knowing and seeing were vastly different things. He wanted nothing more in that moment than to pull over and hug her. She communicated, and drove, and took GED tests. She opened herself up to everything when she had literally come from nothing.</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>In the next town, they came upon a tiny motel. Carmine paid the old man at the front desk in cash and grabbed the key from him with little conversation. He grimaced at the shabby conditions while Haven shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ve stayed worse places.\u201d</p><p>She had. He understood now.</p><p>Carmine was startled awake by a ringing the next morning, the shrill noise causing his heart to violently pound. Sitting up, he rubbed his eyes and grabbed his phone off the stand beside the bed.</p><p>He answered without looking, hoping it was his father calling with some news. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you arrived?\u201d Corrado.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Carmine said, yawning halfway through the word.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be at the Antonellis\u2019 today,\u201d Corrado said. \u201cWe have some business to attend to. Can you bring the girl to me?\u201d</p><p>Glancing in the bed beside him, Carmine met Haven\u2019s apprehensive eyes. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Corrado sighed. \u201cIs that the only word you know?\u201d</p><p>The sarcastic ass in Carmine wanted to say, \u201cYeah,\u201d but he knew it wasn\u2019t wise to fuck with a poisonous snake, so to speak. \u201cNo, sir.\u201d</p><p>Corrado rattled off the Antonellis\u2019 address as Carmine scoured the room for something to write with. He found a short, dull pencil in a drawer and snatched the Bible out of the nightstand, opening it and tearing out the first page. Haven gasped and sat up as he scribbled down the address. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you tore out that page. It\u2019s the Bible, Carmine!\u201d</p><p>He rolled his eyes. \u201cDo you really think anyone who comes here would be reading this?\u201d he asked, holding up the Bible. \u201cPeople who stay here are far from holy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe stayed here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I said, far from holy.\u201d He chuckled. \u201cBut whatever, I didn\u2019t tear out anything with the story on it. The page says Holy Bible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s still wrong,\u201d Haven said.</p><p>\u201cMaybe, but I needed to write down the Antonellis\u2019 address.\u201d</p><p>She froze, her expression panicked. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Sitting down, he brushed some wayward curls out of her face. She looked so vulnerable, and he wanted nothing more than to right every wrong and make the world better for her sake. \u201cYou wanna see your mom, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She blinked rapidly. \u201cCan I?\u201d</p><p>He ran his fingertips along her cheek. \u201cI\u2019ll make sure of it.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes glassed over with tears as she threw herself at him, knocking him back onto the bed.</p><p>Carmine punched the address into the car\u2019s navigation system, and it led them back down the same remote highway from the night before. After a few miles, it alerted them to a path cutting through the desert, and Haven tensed a fraction of a second before the navigation system announced they\u2019d arrived. She recognized it, he realized. She could sense it in the middle of nowhere.</p><p>Haven trembled as he crept down the path, her fear so powerful he could feel it. The ranch came into view, and she inhaled sharply as Carmine parked behind Corrado\u2019s rented sedan.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I can do this,\u201d Haven said, shaking her head so frantically it made him dizzy.</p><p>Carmine grabbed her hands. \u201cListen and listen good, tesoro. You may wanna run as far away from this place as possible, but you can\u2019t. Not anymore. You can\u2019t let them control you. You can\u2019t let them win. You\u2019re strong, Haven. These motherfuckers tried to tear you down, but it didn\u2019t work because you built yourself up. You\u2019re a force to be reckoned with. You\u2019re tough and passionate, and you can\u2019t let these people get to you. That\u2019s what they want.\u201d</p><p>The anxiety in her expression was replaced with something else, a look Carmine could recognize anywhere: determination.</p><p>\u201cSo we\u2019re gonna get out of this car, and we\u2019re gonna go in this house, and we\u2019re gonna tell these people to kiss our asses, because they can\u2019t touch us. And you\u2019re gonna go out there and tell your mom you love her, because you deserve that chance.\u201d</p><p>Having said everything he could say, Carmine got out of the car. He groaned at the heat, the bright sun blinding him. Grabbing his sunglasses, he put them on and unbuttoned his long-sleeved green shirt. \u201cFuck, it\u2019s hot.\u201d</p><p>Haven stepped out timidly. \u201cI remember it being hotter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m about to burn up,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s hot as Hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is Hell.\u201d</p><p>He gaped at her. \u201cYou cursed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell isn\u2019t a curse word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it is.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cIt\u2019s in the Bible, Carmine. If you spent more time reading it and less time tearing pages out of it, maybe you\u2019d know that.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, but a slamming door interrupted the moment. Haven went rigid as Carmine glanced at the man standing on the porch, his eyes a familiar deep brown shade Carmine knew well.</p><p>\u201cIf this is Hell,\u201d Carmine said, \u201cdoes that make him the devil?\u201d</p><p>40</p><p>Michael Antonelli stood on his front porch, a glass of whiskey in his left hand and a lit cigar in his right. He wasn\u2019t speaking. He wasn\u2019t blinking. He didn\u2019t even appear to be breathing.</p><p>Haven stared at him, stunned by how utterly unchanged he looked. It had nearly been a year, but seeing her old master in his khaki pants and polo shirt, too tight around his bulging gut, made it feel like no time had passed.</p><p>The tense silence shattered when the door behind Michael opened, jolting him back alive. Blinking rapidly, he moved out of the way as Corrado stepped onto the porch. \u201cCarmine, Haven . . . nice to see you. Are you enjoying your trip?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The nonchalance of the question surprised Haven, but Carmine didn\u2019t appear to be put off as he answered. \u201cIt\u2019s been fine, except for the fact that I feel like I\u2019m being boiled alive.\u201d</p><p>Haven smiled involuntarily at his complaining as Corrado\u2019s gaze turned to Michael. \u201cAre you going to invite the kids in, Antonelli, or do you intend to let my nephew burst into flames? I was under the impression you remembered how to be hospitable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah!\u201d Michael stuck his cigar into his mouth and opened the screen door. \u201cCome inside.\u201d</p><p>Carmine took Haven\u2019s hand and led her into the house, the two of them following Corrado down the hallway to a cramped office in the back. Haven hesitated, scanning the cluttered walls. For years she had lived on the property, trapped and forced to work in servitude, but never in that time had she been in that room. Michael said it was private, his sanctuary.</p> <p>Michael walked in behind them and took a seat in front of a shiny mahogany desk as Corrado stood off to the side with his arms crossed over his chest. \u201cWe\u2019re waiting for one more.\u201d</p><p>Haven looked to Carmine, but he offered no explanation if he had one.</p><p>After a few minutes there was a knock on the front door of the ranch. Corrado walked out to answer it, returning with another man carrying a briefcase. Michael tensed as he eyed him, blinking rapidly. \u201cWhat are we\u2014? Why\u2019s the lawyer here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get this done,\u201d Corrado said, ignoring the question. Haven sat down, slinking into a chair in the corner so not to make a scene. Michael glared at her from across the room, uncomfortable silence enveloping the space between them, an invisible wall of pressure separating their chairs.</p><p>The lawyer talked about naturalization and citizenship, but none of it made sense to her. He filled out paperwork as he spoke but hesitated on a document, glancing at Haven. \u201cMiss, what\u2019s your birthday?\u201d</p> <p>Her heart thumped wildly. \u201cI\u2019m not sure. Mama said it was in the fall.\u201d</p><p>The man\u2019s forehead creased as his eyes shifted to Michael. \u201cMr. Antonelli? Her date of birth?\u201d</p><p>Michael grumbled but said nothing coherent as Corrado sighed exaggeratedly. \u201cSeptember tenth, 1988.\u201d</p><p>The lawyer wrote it down, while Haven stared at Corrado. She wondered how he knew, the date running through her mind. September 10 . . . it was two weeks away.</p><p>When finished, the lawyer handed the paperwork to Corrado, who set it on the desk in front of Michael. \u201cSign it,\u201d he demanded.</p><p>Michael begrudgingly signed before shifting the stack of papers in Haven\u2019s direction. She could feel his eyes on her as he held out the pen. She took it without looking at him. Glancing through the papers, she spotted the blank lines beside where he\u2019d signed. Her hand trembled as she scribbled her name beside his.</p> <p>She wondered if he was surprised she could write. Take that, buddy.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d Corrado said. \u201cIt\u2019s done.\u201d</p><p>What was done? Haven wasn\u2019t sure, but Michael didn\u2019t appear happy about it.</p><p>Haven stepped onto the porch of the house, taking a deep breath of the scalding desert air. Her stomach felt queasy, her nerves running amuck. She needed space. She needed to be away from those people. She needed Carmine.</p><p>She called for him, but a loud commotion stopped her before she could step back inside. Startled by the disruption, Haven turned, her breath hitching when she saw her mama standing at the corner of the house, a bunch of metal tools laying in a pile at her feet.</p><p>Unlike Michael, she looked different. Her dark hair was streaked with gray, and wrinkles lined her weary face. A dirty shirt swallowed her skeletal frame, a pair of shorts exposing startlingly thin legs. Her mama had always been skinny, but now she was a shell of her former self.</p><p>\u201cHaven?\u201d</p><p>The sound of her voice was like blistering iron striking Haven\u2019s chest. Her feet frantically carried her to her mama, their bodies colliding as they both fell to the ground. Her mama\u2019s embrace was strong despite her frail body, her hands traveling Haven\u2019s back and hair as she clung to her. \u201cMy baby girl! You\u2019re here!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d she choked out. \u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>Her mama pulled from the embrace. \u201cWhy are you here? You have to get away!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Haven said. \u201cNo one\u2019s going to hurt me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be sure! You know how they are!\u201d</p><p>Haven tried to smile through her tears. \u201cI\u2019m here to see you.\u201d</p><p>Her hands explored Haven\u2019s face. \u201cI don\u2019t understand. It doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarmine brought me. He\u2019s, uh . . . he\u2019s my master\u2019s son. I love him, Mama.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou love him?\u201d She stared at her, blinking rapidly. \u201cThis is bad. You can never let him know!\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d Her mama\u2019s panic caused her anxiety to flare. \u201cHe already knows. He loves me, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d She shook her head. \u201cHaven, he\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWonderful, Mama,\u201d she interrupted, knowing whatever she said would be wrong. \u201cHe treats me like a treasure, and he\u2019s giving me a life . . . the kind of life you always wanted me to have.\u201d</p><p>They sat on the ground for a few minutes, neither speaking after that was verbalized. Her mama\u2019s panic lessened, the look Haven had seen growing up creeping back in.</p><p>Hope.</p><p>Eventually, Haven stood and helped her mama to her feet. \u201cThese are nice clothes,\u201d her mama said, giving her a once-over. \u201cI hope they don\u2019t get mad you got them dirty.\u201d</p><p>Haven blocked her mama\u2019s hands as she tried to brush the dirt away. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. They\u2019re different.\u201d</p><p>Tears welled in her mama\u2019s eyes at the statement, but the banging screen door stopped her from saying anything. Michael stepped onto the porch and looked at them. \u201cMiranda.\u201d</p><p>No good ever came from being singled out. Frenzied, her mama gathered the things she had dropped. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, sir. I\u2019m supposed to be in the garden.\u201d</p><p>Michael put his hand up to stop her, and Haven and her mama both flinched at his sudden movement. \u201cDon\u2019t interrupt me. The girl\u2019s here with, uh . . . she\u2019s our guest, so work can wait for now.\u201d</p><p>Her mama gaped at her after Michael walked away. \u201cGuest?\u201d</p><p>Haven smiled. \u201cI guess I should start at the beginning, huh?\u201d</p><p>They spent the next few hours walking around the property as Haven told her mama about life in North Carolina, telling stories about celebrating Christmas, watching fireworks, and going to a dance. The more Haven spoke, the more her mama lit up. The life came back into her, little by little easing Haven\u2019s guilt.</p><p>They were standing at the edge of the garden as her mama kicked around some dirt in her bare feet, pulling a few stray weeds. She couldn\u2019t refrain from working even when told she didn\u2019t have to. \u201cThe DeMarco family. That name sounds familiar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve been here before,\u201d Haven said. \u201cI used to think the woman was an angel.\u201d</p><p>Her mama looked at her. \u201cYour angel?\u201d</p><p>Haven nodded. \u201cI thought I made her up, but I guess she was real.\u201d</p><p>Her mama\u2019s eyes drifted past her shoulder at something, and Haven swung around to see Carmine approach. \u201cSpeak of the devil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought we said the asshole in the house was the devil,\u201d Carmine said, shaking his head. \u201cChrist, he\u2019s a dickhead. I thought Corrado was going to kick my ass for saying shit to him.\u201d</p><p>She sighed, knowing he had no filter to stop things from springing from his lips. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I said a lot. He\u2019s kind of a punk, you know? He\u2019ll fuck with those lesser than him but can\u2019t stand up to his equals.\u201d His eyes widened. \u201cI\u2019m not saying you\u2019re less than him or anything, or that I\u2019m better than you, because I\u2019m not. You\u2019re better than him. Hell, you\u2019re better than me, and I tell\u2014\u201d</p><p>Haven covered his mouth so he\u2019d stop rambling, and her mama gasped. Turning to look at her, Haven pulled her hand from Carmine\u2019s mouth as a reflex, but he wrapped his arms around her before she could move away. \u201cYou should introduce me, tesoro.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cMama, this is Carmine. Carmine, this is my mama.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice to finally meet you,\u201d he said politely, holding out his hand.</p><p>Her mama hesitantly took it, staring at him.</p><p>Corrado\u2019s voice interrupted then as he stepped out of the house. \u201cThe food\u2019s ready. I thought you\u2019d like to know, since Carmine complained earlier he was going to die of starvation.\u201d</p><p>Haven rolled her eyes as Carmine chuckled. \u201cWhat? I haven\u2019t eaten anything today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo eat if you\u2019re hungry,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAre you coming? You haven\u2019t eaten, either.\u201d</p><p>Haven stubbornly shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m not eating when she can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Her mama sighed. \u201cEat if they\u2019ll let you, Haven. I\u2019ll be here when you\u2019re done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Carmine\u2019s brow furrowed. \u201cWhy can\u2019t she eat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaster feeds us at night, but never during the day . . . and definitely not with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI forgot about that,\u201d Carmine said. \u201cThat\u2019s bullshit. You should eat when you wanna eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>Carmine let go of Haven and went for the house. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not. Wait here. I\u2019ll fix this shit.\u201d</p><p>A few minutes later, the screen door slammed as Carmine stepped outside, heading toward them with two plates. Haven smiled when he approached. \u201cYou\u2019re so good to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, that\u2019s my line,\u201d he said playfully, handing Haven a plate. \u201cQuit stealing my shit.\u201d</p><p>He held the other one out to her mama, who made no attempt to take it, so Haven did. She eyed the sandwiches, the bread smashed down with a handprint in the center of it. \u201cDid you make this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Carmine said. \u201cI can make a sandwich, you know.\u201d</p><p>Smiling proudly, Haven thrust the second plate at her mama. \u201cEat.\u201d</p><p>She took it, her hands shaking. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d Carmine said. \u201cYou two sit down somewhere and eat.\u201d Haven went to sit right where she was, but Carmine grabbed her arm. \u201cYou can\u2019t sit somewhere less dirty?\u201d</p><p>Ignoring him, she plopped down. \u201cI\u2019m already dirty.\u201d</p><p>Carmine shook his head as a small dust cloud rose into the air. \u201cNow you got me dirty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless you plan to do your own laundry, I don\u2019t see why you\u2019re complaining.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cBecause it wouldn\u2019t be me if I didn\u2019t complain. Enjoy your sandwiches. It\u2019s the best I could do. You know I can\u2019t cook, but I do love you.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her before heading to the house as her mama finally sat down beside Haven. The frailty and exhaustion was still evident in her face, but she appeared at peace. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Carmine stood at the window, watching Haven out in the yard as time wound down, the sun dipping below the horizon and turning the sky the color of glowing coal.</p><p>He could feel Michael\u2019s eyes boring into him from where he sat across the room, puffing on his third cigar. The stench of smoke made Carmine\u2019s stomach turn. Michael wheezed when he breathed, like he was constantly struggling to speak, but not a word had come from him in more than two hours. Fucking coward.</p><p>Corrado strolled over to Carmine, both of them taking in the scene outside.</p><p>\u201cYou have to help her,\u201d Carmine said, the thought of separating them tearing him up inside.</p> <p>Corrado continued to stare straight ahead. \u201cDo you remember when your grandfather died?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVaguely,\u201d he said. \u201cI was only six.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was outside your grandparents\u2019 house after the funeral, and your mother sat down beside me. Your mother . . . she never liked to come near me, so for her to do it was a big deal.\u201d He paused. \u201cWhen she gathered the courage to speak, she said those exact words: You have to help her.\u201d</p><p>Carmine gaped at him. \u201cHaven?\u201d</p><p>Corrado nodded. \u201cI told your mother it wasn\u2019t my place, but I should\u2019ve tried. I owed her that much.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou owed her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I did, but why is irrelevant. The only thing that matters is I never made it up to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes that mean you\u2019re gonna help?\u201d</p><p>He cut his eyes at him. \u201cI vouched for her, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you did, but . . .\u201d Carmine trailed off, glancing out at Haven in the yard. \u201cWhat about her mom? Can\u2019t you help her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help everyone. There will always be someone, somewhere, who needs something.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know, but this isn\u2019t just someone,\u201d Carmine said. \u201cThis is her family, like we\u2019re family.\u201d</p><p>Corrado\u2019s stare was hard. \u201cYou\u2019re playing the family card?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI, uh . . .\u201d Carmine hesitated, but there was no point denying it. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re certain you want to do that?\u201d</p><p>Corrado\u2019s tone made Carmine question it momentarily. Did he? \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>Turning to the window, Corrado shook his head. \u201cThe most I can do is let her live in my home. It\u2019s a risk, but frankly, after vouching for your girlfriend, I doubt it\u2019s possible to dig myself in any deeper. If I die, that\u2019ll be what kills me. Everything else is extra.\u201d Corrado turned to Michael, who still sat quietly in his chair. \u201cAny objections, Antonelli?\u201d</p><p>Michael stammered. He hadn\u2019t heard a word of what they\u2019d said. \u201cUh, I . . . well, I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Corrado raised an eyebrow, the look on his face enough to make Carmine balk. \u201cWhat do you mean you don\u2019t know?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI mean . . .\u201d He shook his head. \u201cSure, it\u2019s fine with me.\u201d</p><p>Corrado turned around. \u201cWe\u2019ll handle it all tonight, then. Drop Haven off at the hotel and come back. It should be settled by then.\u201d</p><p>Carmine finally made his way outside. As soon as Haven spotted him, a cold sense of dread settled deep within her. He paused a few feet away. \u201cI\u2019ll give you a minute.\u201d</p><p>Her mama pulled her into a hug, tears streaming from her eyes, but a radiant smile shined from her lips. \u201cYou don\u2019t know how much it means to me to see you like this. My baby girl, with the world at her fingertips.\u201d</p><p>Haven squeezed her tightly. \u201cI love you, Mama.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too. I always have. I want you to go out there and live your life.\u201d</p><p>Her chest ached at having to leave her again. \u201cI miss you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI miss you too, but the world is a better place with you in it,\u201d her mama said, pulling from the hug. \u201cNow get away from this place. I\u2019m happy to see you again, but I\u2019ll be happier knowing you\u2019re out there living.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I can\u2019t leave you here, Mama. Not again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush,\u201d she said sternly. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about me.\u201d</p><p>Haven tried to speak, wanting to object, but her mama didn\u2019t give her a chance.</p><p>\u201cGo,\u201d she said again. \u201cYou found your place in the world. Don\u2019t let me hold you back from it.\u201d</p><p>Haven covered her mouth as tears blurred her vision. Taking a few steps back, she gave her mama one last look before running for the car.</p><p>41</p><p>It was pitch black when Carmine made it back to the ranch that night, the dry desert air still scorching. He started toward the house, irritable and uncomfortable, but froze when the front door opened. Miranda walked out, her eyes darting around wildly. Even in the darkness, Carmine could make out a faint hand-shaped mark on her throat.</p><p>\u201cWho did this to you?\u201d Carmine asked. \u201cI\u2019ll fucking kill them.\u201d</p><p>Panic flashed in Miranda\u2019s expression. \u201cPlease don\u2019t make a scene.\u201d</p><p>He fought to keep a grip on his temper. \u201cIt\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but . . . please.\u201d She stepped into the yard, nervousness in her expression. She worried she was being watched. \u201cI remember when your mama visited. She used to talk about a world outside of this place for my daughter. She said Haven was special.\u201d</p><p>Hearing those words made Carmine\u2019s chest ache with longing. \u201cShe is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means a lot to hear you say that. I hardly recognize my daughter, you know. She\u2019s still that sweet baby girl I raised, but she\u2019s happy. She\u2019s better off away from all of this.\u201d She walked away but paused after a few steps. \u201cI heard someone talking about safe houses once and how they helped people get free. They called them havens. I named her that because she was my haven. She was my safe place in this ugly world. When she was born, I had a reason to live. My baby girl, my Haven, needed to be protected. I\u2019ve done all I can, so I\u2019m asking you to look out for her out there. Keep her away from people like these. Can you do that?\u201d</p><p>Carmine was stunned at the trust she placed in him. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said. \u201cI can rest easy now.\u201d</p><p>The front door opened and Miranda bolted for the stables before he could say another word. Carmine glanced at the porch as Corrado stepped out, his eyebrows raised. \u201cDid you tell her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you scared her away before I could.\u201d</p><p>A loud screeching ricocheted from the house. Footsteps pounded across the floor as a woman\u2019s voice echoed out to them. \u201cMy brother vouched for that little bitch?\u201d</p><p>Carmine went up the steps, but Corrado grabbed his shirt to stop him. \u201cDon\u2019t say anything.\u201d</p><p>The front door thrust open, and Katrina stepped out. Her steps faltered when she saw Carmine, but she regained her composure and turned to her brother. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you, Corrado! What did you make my husband sign this morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe signed what was necessary,\u201d he said, his outward appearance not reflecting the anger brewing on the inside.</p><p>Katrina laughed bitterly. \u201cNecessary? None of this is necessary! You\u2019re freeing that damn girl and taking her mother? What\u2019s gotten into you? Is it because of her? Is that what this is about?\u201d</p><p>Fire flared in Corrado\u2019s eyes as he lost his composure. \u201cEnough!\u201d</p><p>Carmine\u2019s heart thumped frantically, but Katrina wasn\u2019t fazed. \u201cIt is, isn\u2019t it? Trying to make up for the past? It can\u2019t be fixed!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you again, Katrina.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not afraid of you,\u201d she said, closing the distance between them. \u201cYou\u2019re screwing up my life over this! Why do these people matter? Just because these stupid DeMarcos fall\u2014\u201d</p><p>Corrado\u2019s arms shot out, his hands grasping her by the throat and cutting off her words midsentence. She choked, her manicured fingernails digging into his flesh as she tried to pry his hands off. Even as she drew blood, Corrado didn\u2019t waver.</p><p>\u201cAre you done now?\u201d he asked, the eerie calmness returning. Katrina gurgled as she fought for oxygen and words. \u201cBurns, doesn\u2019t it? Imagine how they feel when you torture them. Imagine how she felt that day, Kat, when those men were choking her, when they were violating her, and you did nothing to stop it.\u201d</p><p>Corrado continued to stare at his sister, giving no indication he was going to let go. Michael bounded out the front door of the house and gasped. \u201cStop! You\u2019ll kill her!\u201d</p><p>Corrado\u2019s eyes snapped to Michael. There was no emotion in his expression, nothing but darkness. This was the Corrado Carmine feared.</p><p>Before he could dwell, a commotion rang out from the stables as the horses reared up, spooked by something. Corrado let go of Katrina, his eyes meeting Carmine\u2019s as he hurried down the steps. Carmine leaped off the porch after him.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not her,\u201d Katrina screamed. \u201cJust because he\u2019s doing the same thing as his father doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re the same!\u201d</p><p>Those words caught Carmine off guard. He swung around to look at Katrina, not paying attention to where he was going. He ran straight into Corrado\u2019s back as his uncle stopped in the doorway to the stables. Corrado shoved Carmine inside, and sickness rocked through him as the air left his lungs. He dry heaved, trying to breathe through the bile that flooded his chest. It burned, suffocating, and his vision blurred as he nearly blacked out.</p><p>Flashes of memory hit him, buckling his knees. The gunshot, the blood, the terror, the hooded figure pointing the gun at him. And there was his mom, lying dead in the darkened alleyway after the shrill screams rang out in the night.</p><p>Corrado yanked him upright by his shirt and shoved him again, forcing him back to reality. \u201cGet a grip, Carmine.\u201d</p><p>A small wooden stool lay on the ground in front of him, tipped over in a pile of hay, while a pair of dirty bare feet swung a few inches above it. The frail, familiar form hung limp like a rag doll, affixed to a low rafter by a piece of thick rope.</p><p>Carmine lunged forward and grabbed Miranda\u2019s legs as he yelled for help. Corrado yanked a pair of garden shears from the wall and snipped the rope. The body fell on Carmine, and he staggered a few steps, nearly losing his footing. Laying her on the ground, he checked for a pulse but couldn\u2019t find one.</p><p>Katrina and Michael rushed in as Carmine did CPR, pounding on her chest and desperately forcing air into her lungs. Her body was still warm like she was asleep, but her wide eyes and ashen face told another story. Carmine could hear Katrina shouting and Michael\u2019s rushed voice, but the sound of his blood pumping through his body drowned out their words.</p><p>Panic. All he could feel was panic.</p><p>Nothing Carmine did helped. Ribs cracked sickeningly under the force of his compressions, her body not absorbing any of his air. Miranda lay still on the ground, her heart no longer beating.</p><p>Corrado grabbed his shoulder. \u201cShe\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>Carmine shrugged him off. \u201cNo, she\u2019s not! We have to save her!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not!\u201d He hysterically pushed on her chest some more. \u201cWhy are you just standing there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing we can do.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHelp her!

He looked around frantically, hoping it was a vicious nightmare he would soon wake up from, and spotted a smug smile on Katrina\u2019s lips.</p><p>The sight of it made him lose control. \u201cThis is your fault!\u201d He looked between Katrina and Michael. \u201cYou killed her! You made her do this!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho cares?\u201d Katrina snapped. \u201cShe\u2019s a slave!\u201d</p><p>The moment those words met his ears, all logic fizzled away. \u201cNo, she wasn\u2019t a slave!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarmine!\u201d Corrado warned.</p> <p>\u201cShe was a Principessa!\u201d he said, ignoring his uncle. \u201cSalvatore\u2019s gonna kill you when he finds out!\u201d</p><p>Grabbing the garden shears from the ground by his leg, Carmine flung them at Katrina and struck her in the side when she tried to move away. Deranged, she grabbed a shovel and ran toward him. He scurried backward and tried to get to his feet as she raised the shovel above her head. Corrado reacted swiftly, pulling his gun from his coat and aiming it at his sister with no hesitation. The sound of the gunshot ricocheted off the walls in the small enclosure, and Carmine recoiled at the deafening noise. The horses reared up again, spooked by the gunshot.</p><p>Katrina gasped as the bullet ripped through her chest, her footsteps halting as she swung the shovel in reaction. It slammed into Carmine\u2019s shoulder blade, sharp pain running through his left side. Katrina sputtered and dropped the shovel to clutch her chest. Another shot rang out, hitting dead center between her eyes, and she dropped to the ground.</p><p>A frantic Michael screamed, lunging for him, and Corrado reacted once more. Ducking, Carmine covered his head when the gunshot rang out, blood splattering in his direction as the bullet ripped through Michael\u2019s skull. He fell forward with a thud beside his wife, limp on impact.</p><p>Carmine dry heaved again as Corrado fired a few more shots into their bodies, his finger casually pulling the trigger as if it meant nothing. As if they weren\u2019t people. As if they weren\u2019t his family.</p><p>Glaring, Corrado yanked Carmine off the ground. He staggered a few steps as he gained his footing, his legs trying to buckle under his weight. He swayed, trying to hold everything in, but the annihilation sent shockwaves through him.</p> <p>Corrado returned his gun to his coat and pulled out his cell phone as Carmine sat on the small stool. Putting his head between his legs, he covered his face with his hands and took deep breaths. He counted to ten, trying to calm down, but his ears rang and head pounded as Corrado spoke calmly into the phone.</p><p>One.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s been an incident.\u201d</p><p>Two.</p><p>\u201cI burned two, sir.\u201d</p><p>Three.</p><p>\u201cA confrontation escalated.\u201d</p><p>Four.</p> <p>\u201cI had to act.\u201d</p><p>Five.</p><p>\u201cMy sister and her husband.\u201d</p><p>Six.</p><p>\u201cI take full responsibility.\u201d</p><p>Seven.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get a place ready.\u201d</p><p>Eight.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ll accept any consequences . . .\u201d</p><p>Nine.</p><p>\u201c . . . even if it means rescinding my vouch for the girl.\u201d</p><p>Ten.</p><p>Carmine stared at his uncle when he hung up. \u201cRescind your vouch?\u201d</p><p>Corrado slipped his phone into his pocket. \u201cYes. You better hope Sal feels forgiving, because I just broke our code of conduct.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI, uh . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing else to say, Carmine. What\u2019s done is done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, uh . . .\u201d Corrado\u2019s nonchalance scared him. \u201cYour sister. You always protect your family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re my nephew, correct?\u201d Carmine nodded. \u201cAnd Katrina attacked you, correct?\u201d Another nod. \u201cThat means I protected my family. My sister and her husband made their beds, and it\u2019s nobody\u2019s fault but their own they now lie in them.\u201d</p><p>Carmine didn\u2019t speak, afraid he\u2019d get sick if he tried. He never imagined things would happen like this\u2014never imagined the day would end with him splattered in blood, the same blood that coursed through Haven\u2019s veins, while both of the people who brought her into existence were dead.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s over now,\u201d Corrado said, looking at the bodies. \u201cThis isn\u2019t yours to deal with . . . it\u2019s mine. But I hope this teaches you a lesson, and you finally realize you don\u2019t know everything.\u201d</p><p>Haven jolted awake, a sinking feeling in the pit of her stomach as she sat upright in the dark motel room. The black-and-white static on the television screen faintly illuminated Carmine standing by the doorway. A strange sensation trickled through her, a coldness starting in her chest. \u201cCarmine?\u201d</p><p>He stared at her, and in the glow of the television, she could see his panic. His eyes shined with tears of desperation, and she knew something had gone wrong.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d she asked. \u201cIs everything okay?\u201d</p><p>Carmine took a step forward and ever so slightly shook his head. The subtle movement rocked her foundation. When he stepped farther into the light, she could see the red on his shirt, the splatter of blood. She had seen it before, streaking her blue dress as she stared down at the body of the fallen teenage girl. It was the mark of desolation. It was the mark of death. \u201cOh God, are you okay? Are you hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not me,\u201d he whispered, his face twisting in agony. \u201cShe\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s gone. Haven knew those words. He\u2019d said them about his own mama.</p><p>Haven\u2019s chest constricted as it felt like her lungs had collapsed, her insides bursting into vicious flames. \u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>Carmine\u2019s raspy voice echoed with distress as he reached for her, but she pushed him as hard as she could. \u201cStop! You\u2019re wrong! Where is she, Carmine? What happened to my mama?\u201d</p><p>Despite her attempts to get away, Carmine grabbed her and squeezed her tightly. She tried to push out of his arms but he held on, never wavering. \u201cLet go! Tell me where she is!\u201d</p><p>He shushed her, and she could hear his voice tremble as he started to cry. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, hummingbird, but she isn\u2019t coming back.\u201d</p><p>His tears shattered what was left of her resolve. Uncontrollable sobs ripped from her as she wailed on him, screaming that he didn\u2019t know anything. Balling her hands into fists, she repeatedly hit him in the back. He took every blow in stride, never once loosening his grip.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said. \u201cI did everything I could, but she\u2019s fucking gone.\u201d</p><p>Her panic surged. She chanted the word no and screamed incoherently, telling him he needed to go make it right. She blamed him, because he wasn\u2019t giving her an explanation, his reassuring words only stinging more. He ignored his ringing phone, not moving an inch as he took everything she threw at him, every harsh word and painful scream.</p><p>Every \u201cI hate you\u201d echoing from her chest was followed by an \u201cI love you\u201d from his lips. Every time she begged him to let go, he told her he would be there forever. His hold was strong, his arms familiar, but it did nothing to take away her pain.</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t suffer,\u201d he whispered. \u201cIt was her choice.\u201d</p><p>Haven barely said a thing for days. Carmine explained to her what happened, told her what he knew, but she didn\u2019t react. She said nothing. They stayed in the motel in California for the rest of the week, but by the time the weekend rolled around, they had to go. The Mafia had departed and his father was still alive, having diffused another situation. They had only come to clean out the basement, worried about the police attention centered on Vincent.</p><p>The drive was strained without conversation. Carmine stopped frequently during the day to take breaks. By the time the weekend came to a close, they were pulling back into the city limits of Durante. He parked beside his father\u2019s Mercedes when they reached the house, and he climbed out, stretching. Haven went straight inside, not bothering to wait for him. He followed her, running into his father the moment he stepped into the foyer.</p><p>Vincent eyed them cautiously. \u201cHey, kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Carmine said.</p><p>\u201cDr. DeMarco,\u201d Haven said. \u201cMay I be excused, sir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, dolcezza. You don\u2019t have to ask.\u201d</p><p>Carmine frowned, watching as she disappeared up the stairs. \u201cI guess I\u2019m going to bed.\u201d</p><p>His father sighed. \u201cTake it one day at a time, Carmine.\u201d</p><p>42</p><p>Bookcases towered above Haven like skyscrapers. Strolling among the stacks, she occasionally pulled out a book and surveyed the front cover before skimming the description on the back.</p><p>They\u2019d been back in Durante for a few days, just in time for Carmine\u2019s senior year of school. He immersed himself in class and football, leaving Haven with days to fill on her own. She cooked and cleaned, but she still had hours left over with nothing to do and no one to talk to.</p><p>Needing something to distract her, she turned to the library, hoping to get lost in a different world, to be absorbed in a fictional time and place, the life of someone else. She wanted to forget about everything so she wasn\u2019t constantly plagued with thoughts of her mama\u2019s last moments. She found herself wondering what she\u2019d been thinking: Had she been scared? Had she been in pain? Was there ever a moment that she second-guessed her decision?</p><p>The feeling of failure nagged Haven. She ran that day in Blackburn because she had been desperate to save her mama, and she hadn\u2019t forgotten that. But now it was too late. Her mama was gone.</p><p>Haven ran her fingers along the spines of some books, and came across one without a name. She pulled out the leather-bound book and a piece of paper tumbled to the floor. She picked it up and unfolded it, her brow furrowing when she saw it was a letter.</p><p>Walking to the chair by the window, she sat with the book in her lap as she scanned the withering note.</p><p>10/08/97</p><p>Mrs. DeMarco,</p><p>After careful consideration, I\u2019ve decided I can no longer be a part of this investigation. I took the case without knowing the details, and had I known them at the time, I would have declined. For all intents and purposes, Haven Antonelli does not exist, and I implore you to forget you ever encountered her. Enclosed you\u2019ll find a full refund of my fees. Consider our contract severed, and I request you no longer contact me concerning this.</p><p>Arthur L. Brannigan</p><p>Private Investigator</p><p>Stunned, Haven scanned the paper a second time, certain she had to have misread, as pieces of the puzzle filled in to expose a hidden picture that left her speechless. Eyes brimming with tears, her stomach dropped when she realized the date on the top of the paper.</p><p>October 8, 1997\u2014a few days before Maura DeMarco had been killed.</p><p>Vincent tapped his pen against his desk, surrounded by mounds of files. Work piled up, but he couldn\u2019t focus on it. His attention kept wandering, his thoughts and eyes drifting toward the live feed playing on the screen beside him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It had been two weeks since the kids had returned from Blackburn, and the days had proven to be some of the longest of Vincent\u2019s life. The atmosphere in the house was tense, the silence that followed both of them unsettling. He sat behind his desk every night and watched his son pace the hallway just feet from the office door, his hands assaulting his hair as he berated himself. Vincent couldn\u2019t hear him, but he knew where his thoughts were.</p><p>Vincent pressed a few buttons on the computer and the screen changed to a view of the library. He spotted the girl, curled up in the chair by the window with a book on her lap. It was the same place she had been every night while his son paced\u2014sitting in the darkness and staring out into the yard. She withdrew further and further as time went on, but Vincent was too exhausted to mediate.</p><p>He was in deep with la famiglia. He lied, cheated, plundered, and slaughtered for them, but one thing he had prided himself on was his loyalty. He may have been a criminal, but at least he could think himself an honorable one. That had fallen to the wayside as of late, and they weren\u2019t ignorant to his behavior. They made that obvious during their recent visit. Every one of them was trained to spot deception . . . and Vincent was weary of being dishonest.</p><p>Maura had once told him that while not everyone lived, everyone did die, and with death came release. Death meant freedom\u2014freedom from the things that hold us back. Vincent used to tease her when she said such things, but he understood now. He understood what it was like to wish you could find peace, but you couldn\u2019t because your work wasn\u2019t done. You hadn\u2019t served your purpose, and until you did, you were damned to keep going. Vincent envied those who could rest in peace. What he wouldn\u2019t give to have the weight of the world lifted from his shoulders.</p> <p>He switched cameras once more and went back to the hallway. Carmine still paced, his eyes darting between the office and the stairs to the third floor. Vincent glanced at the time: after eleven in the evening. Carmine usually made his decision before now and stomped up the stairs. The girl would scurry out of the library, darting to her bedroom before he made it there.</p><p>Tonight things changed, though. When Carmine headed toward the office door, Vincent felt nothing but relief. Judgment Day had come. One step closer to peace.</p><p>The knob turned and Carmine stepped inside, slamming the door behind him. Vincent refrained from chastising him for not knocking, thankful he had actually made it inside. \u201cSit down,\u201d he said, switching the view back to the library.</p><p>Carmine flopped down in the chair with a huff. Vincent met his gaze, seeing the curiosity and confusion. Resentment lurked underneath, but Vincent couldn\u2019t blame him.</p><p>\u201cYou look like you haven\u2019t fucking slept in years,\u201d Carmine said. \u201cAnd Christ, have you eaten?\u201d</p> <p>Vincent leaned back in his chair. \u201cYou want to discuss my health, Carmine?\u201d</p><p>His expression was sober. \u201cYeah, you look fucked up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, thanks for the compliment, but something tells me you haven\u2019t spent the past week loitering outside my office gathering the courage to hold an intervention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow . . . ?\u201d Carmine paused. \u201cYou\u2019ve been watching the cameras.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said, \u201cand I was beginning to wonder if you ever planned to come in.\u201d</p><p>Carmine sighed. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what to say. No sense barging in just to look at you, since you look like shit and all.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cConsidering you\u2019re here now, does that mean you\u2019ve figured it out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I just got tired of standing in the hall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, I\u2019m better to look at than the white walls, at least?\u201d</p><p>Carmine cracked a smile. \u201cNo, but it\u2019s nice to know I\u2019m not the only one around here who remembers how to joke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTale il padre, tale il figlio,\u201d Vincent said, regretting his choice of words the moment they escaped his lips. Carmine\u2019s smile fell, and Vincent knew exactly what he wanted to know. He\u2019d been dreading this day for years.</p><p>\u201cWhen we were in Blackburn, Katrina said something,\u201d Carmine started. \u201cShe said just because we were doing the same thing didn\u2019t mean we were the same . . . that Haven wasn\u2019t her. And it\u2019s not only that\u2014there\u2019s other shit, too. So I\u2019m wondering, you know . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to know how I met your mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe truth.\u201d</p> <p>The truth. Vincent couldn\u2019t avoid it anymore.</p><p>It had been a scorching afternoon as he stood in the yard of the Moretti mansion in Las Vegas. He brought his hand up to block out the blinding sun as he walked around the side of the house, searching for shade. As soon as he turned the corner, he crashed into someone there. Dropping his hand, he blinked rapidly at the girl in front of him. Pale skin glowed in the sunshine, a stark contrast from her fiery red hair. Deep green eyes watched him cautiously as he stared into them in a trance. Her mouth moved, but the words were lost on him. His stomach twisted, his heart unexpectedly gripped in a vice.</p><p>Colpo di fulmine. He was done for.</p><p>\u201cIs there a problem?\u201d she asked when he pulled her into the shade.</p><p>\u201cThe only problem is I don\u2019t know your name.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cI\u2019m Maura.\u201d</p><p>Maura. Her hair flowed past her shoulders and freckles dotted her nose. She wasn\u2019t Italian\u2014not even close. No Italian he had ever met had eyes that color.</p><p>Those eyes . . . Vincent could never get enough of them. And as he looked across the desk at his youngest child, he saw the same eyes watching him suspiciously.</p><p>\u201cWe met at Celia\u2019s engagement party,\u201d he said, looking away. Sometimes it was still hard for Vincent to take.</p><p>\u201cAnd what was an Irish girl doing at a party for two Italians?\u201d</p><p>Vincent wondered the same thing that day.</p><p>He and Maura had sat against the side of the house, his legs spread out in front of him as he fanned his sweaty skin. Maura\u2019s knees were pulled up to her chest as she plucked the dry grass around them.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not hot?\u201d he asked. They had been sitting there for at least an hour.</p><p>\u201cNo, but you can go inside. The cool air will make you feel better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you go with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way,\u201d she said. \u201cThat wouldn\u2019t be good at all.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cThen I\u2019m not going, either. They haven\u2019t noticed I\u2019m gone, and until they do, I\u2019m staying right where I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill they notice you\u2019re gone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I doubt they remember I\u2019m alive,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p><p>Before she could answer, her eyes darted past him. Vincent turned around and groaned when he saw Katrina at the corner of the house, watching them.</p><p>\u201cGo away, loon,\u201d Vincent said. \u201cI\u2019m not in the mood for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d Katrina spat.</p><p>Maura jumped to her feet, looking away as she trembled. \u201cSorry, Mistress.\u201d</p><p>Mistress. The moment she said it, he knew the truth.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d Carmine asked impatiently, pulling Vincent from his thoughts. \u201cWhy was she there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was the help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe help?\u201d Carmine\u2019s tone was clipped. \u201cLike a maid? Was she a waitress? Because the two of you were fifteen, and that\u2019s not old enough to be employed. Not like you people follow laws or anything . . .\u201d</p><p>Vincent sighed. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t paid.\u201d</p><p>Carmine sprung forward, raising his voice. \u201cIt\u2019s true? Seriously?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Carmine shoved the front of the desk as he stood, thrusting it into Vincent. He grabbed the laptop before it hit the floor as his son rambled. \u201cHow could I have been so fucking stupid? Never would I have imagined she had been . . . you\u2019d have . . . Christ!\u201d</p><p>Vincent shifted his desk back into place. \u201cYou can say the word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he snapped, \u201cbut can you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. It\u2019s just a word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen say it. Drop the \u2018she was the help\u2019 bullshit and say it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSlave,\u201d Vincent said. \u201cTrafficking victim. Call it what you will, it\u2019s all the same.\u201d</p><p>Carmine\u2019s anger flared. \u201cAnd the Morettis had her? Is that why Corrado says he owes her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d have to ask him. That\u2019s not my story to tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it\u2019s not your story to tell,\u201d Carmine said, slamming his hands down on the desk. \u201cThe cop-out answer of the year. Nobody wants to tell me anything, so they pawn it off on everyone else. I can\u2019t believe you kept this from me! After everything, how could you not tell me?\u201d</p><p>Vincent pushed Carmine\u2019s hands away. \u201cIt\u2019s in your best interest to settle down. If you want an explanation, take a seat. If not, get out of my office. The choice is yours, but I\u2019m not going to sit here and let you scold me like a child.\u201d</p><p>Carmine glowered at him, clenching his jaw. Vincent could tell his son wanted to say something, but Carmine was smart enough to know that to get answers, he\u2019d have to do things Vincent\u2019s way.</p><p>Sighing, Carmine flopped down in the chair. Vincent straightened some papers that had been disturbed, giving the computer a quick glance before addressing his son. \u201cWhen do you suppose I should\u2019ve told you? When you were two and didn\u2019t know what slavery was? When you were eight and thought your mother was infallible? After she was gone, when you were already hurting? The time was never right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut don\u2019t you think I had a right to know who my mother really was?\u201d</p><p>The question sent Vincent\u2019s temper flaring. \u201cThat\u2019s not who your mother was! How many times have I overheard you telling the girl that that doesn\u2019t define her? How many times, Carmine? And yet you have the audacity to turn it around and use it against me, against your mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what you meant,\u201d Vincent said. \u201cThis is why I never wanted you to know. Maura wanted people to see a wife and a mother\u2014a woman\u2014not a victim. I let her leave the past behind, and maybe it was unfair to you, but it was her life. It was her decision. I loved your mother, and we went through hell fighting to be together. I\u2019ve tried to make it as easy as possible on you, so maybe you\u2019d learn from my mistakes. I had to learn through trial and error. I lost my patience with her so many times because I didn\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>Carmine covered his face with his hands as he attempted to rein in his emotions. \u201cShe always seemed well adjusted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was our intention,\u201d he said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to taint your perception of the things she did. If you knew the truth, you\u2019d question everything.\u201d</p><p>Tears pooled in his eyes. \u201cAnd this is why she was desperate to help Haven?\u201d</p><p>Vincent was rocking Carmine\u2019s foundation, so he purposely treaded carefully. \u201cMaura wasn\u2019t born into it, but she knew what the child had to look forward to. Your mother wanted to save her before reality hit. The older they are when you pull them out, the less likely they are to adapt.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIs this why we don\u2019t see Grandma? Were you afraid she\u2019d tell us the truth?\u201d</p><p>A bark of laughter sounded through the room, and it took Vincent a second to realize it had come from him. \u201cUh, my mother . . .\u201d He laughed again. \u201cLet\u2019s just say she has her beliefs. A slave was bad enough. An Irish slave was worthy of disownment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo she was Irish? That part\u2019s true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Her father fell into some trouble with the Irish mob. They snatched Maura as collateral when she was six.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe was kidnapped? Didn\u2019t people look for her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course they looked for her, but more than two thousand kids go missing in this country every day. Your mother disappeared before the Internet or any agencies for missing children existed, and certainly before there were things like Amber Alerts. All they had was word of mouth, and once everyone stopped talking about her, it was like she\u2019d never existed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what about her parents?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were killed,\u201d he said. \u201cMaura was sold a few times and ended up with Erika Moretti.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho freed Mom? Who vouched for her?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI suppose you could say I did. Your grandfather said if I wanted something in life, it was my responsibility to earn it. So I initiated, and I\u2019m still paying for it today.\u201d He paused. \u201cIs that all you want to know? Because I\u2019m exhausted and don\u2019t have the energy for this conversation anymore.\u201d</p><p>Carmine nodded, although Vincent could tell he wanted to know much more.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk to your brother, but whether or not you tell the girl is up to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d he said. \u201cShe has enough on her mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI imagine she does,\u201d Vincent said, glancing at the computer to see she still hadn\u2019t moved. \u201cHer mother\u2019s life ended as hers began. Speaking of which . . .\u201d Opening the right bottom desk drawer, he grabbed some files and held them out to Carmine. \u201cHere\u2019s the girl\u2019s paperwork. It\u2019ll take a while before the estate is settled, but no one will contest her inheritance. Technically it all goes to Corrado, anyway, but he\u2019ll hand it over to her once it comes through . . . along with her freedom, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the best gift anyone could give her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a gift, Carmine. It\u2019s what she\u2019s been entitled to all along.\u201d</p><p>Rain splattered the window as it fell from the clouds hovering above. There was no sign of the moon or any stars tonight, nothing but blackness. Ominous, but fitting . . . it was how Haven felt on the inside.</p><p>Empty.</p><p>She might have been taking oxygen into her lungs as her heart pushed blood through her body, but a part of her had stopped existing. It had been a slow, torturous death, agonizingly painful as she withered away from the knowledge it had been her fault.</p><p>Glancing at the clock on the wall, Haven strained her eyes to make out the numbers. There was enough light for her to see the little hand past midnight, another day having begun.</p><p>September 10.</p><p>She watched the rain for a while longer before a shadow moved. Carmine stood a few feet away, watching her. \u201cI think we should go to bed.\u201d</p><p>Grabbing the book in her lap, she set it on the table and hurried to the room before he could say anything else. Carmine followed her and shut the door, pulling her body close to his when he climbed into bed.</p> <p>\u201cBuon compleanno, mia bella ragazza,\u201d he said. \u201cHappy birthday.\u201d</p><p>43</p><p>Haven gazed across the room with blurry, tired eyes, seeing Carmine near the doorway, holding a small plate with a cinnamon bun on it. A single blue candle stuck out from the top. Haven could smell the fresh pastry, the subtle scent of something burned told her who had made them.</p><p>\u201cYou baked?\u201d she asked, stunned.</p><p>Carmine looked sheepish. \u201cI wasn\u2019t gonna attempt a cake. These damn things were hard enough. It took me forever to figure out how to open the canister. I had to call Dia and ask.\u201d</p><p>Haven smiled as he approached, her chest swelling with love to the point it was painful. Despite everything, he was still her world, her one and only. Part of her may have felt dead, but there was still another part of her that lived for Carmine.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s sweet,\u201d she said, taking the plate. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to. I told you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what you told me,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I can\u2019t ignore your birthday. You\u2019ve never had one before. It\u2019s special, so no arguing, because it\u2019s rude to argue when people wanna do shit for you. It\u2019s like, punching a gift horse or something.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cLooking a gift horse in the mouth?\u201d</p><p>Rolling his eyes, he reached into his pocket for a lighter and lit the candle. \u201cYes. A caval donato non si guarda in bocca. Just take it with a smile, and it\u2019ll be over before you know it.\u201d The moment he pulled his hand away, Haven blew out the flame. \u201cEager, are we? Did you make a wish?\u201d</p><p>Her brow furrowed as he pulled the candle from the pastry. \u201cA wish?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou make a wish before you blow out the candle,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the whole point. But you\u2019ll get another chance later with Dia.\u201d</p><p>She tensed. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re gonna spend the night in Charlotte with Dia for your birthday. Come on, did you seriously think you\u2019d get out of dealing with her? We\u2019re pretty much her only friends.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her imploringly, pleading for her not to argue.</p><p>Haven tore the cinnamon bun in half, sharing it with him. The bottom was black and hard to chew, but she said not a word about it as she choked down her piece. Once Carmine finished his, he grabbed a stack of papers and handed them to her.</p><p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cThat, tesoro, is your life.\u201d</p><p>Haven scanned the top paper, a certificate of citizenship, and tears formed when she saw her name. She flipped through the others as her emotions ran rampant, but the papers did nothing but confuse her. Wills, codicils, executors, beneficiary distribution, uniform transfers, custodians, residuary estate, fiduciary . . . \u201cWhat does all this mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s your inheritance. It\u2019ll take a few months before you see anything from it. Actually, it should\u2019ve taken months for the rest of it, too, but Corrado somehow got it pushed through within a few days. I don\u2019t know how he does it. Extortion, probably.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him. \u201cInheritance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, property and money and shit. I mean, I understand you\u2019re not gonna wanna keep the house, but you can sell it or\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhat house?\u201d</p><p>He stopped speaking and looked at her with surprise. \u201cUh, the house in Blackburn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you saying that house belongs to me?\u201d He nodded, and she blinked a few times as she tried to absorb the information. \u201cI don\u2019t want it. I don\u2019t want anything that belonged to those people.\u201d</p><p>Frowning, Carmine grabbed her hand. \u201cLook, don\u2019t think of it as them giving you anything, but after what you\u2019ve been through, you kinda deserve this. It\u2019s like atonement. And I\u2019m not saying any amount of money will make up for it, because it won\u2019t. But after all of the torture and everything you lost, you\u2019re at least entitled to this. Does that make sense?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd money will help with these things,\u201d he said, grabbing the papers and shifting them around so the citizenship certificate was back on top.</p><p>\u201cWhat happens to me now? I\u2019m still here . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father said you can stay here as long as you want, but you don\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut where else would I go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWherever you want,\u201d he said. \u201cI told you that. California, New York, Timbuktu, Bum Fuck Egypt . . . You name it, we\u2019ll go. Or you can go alone. Whatever you want.\u201d</p><p>Tears streamed from her eyes, and she clutched the papers as her hands shook. Carmine pulled her down onto the bed as emotion took control and rocked her body in his embrace. Overwhelmed, she didn\u2019t know what to think. \u201cI don\u2019t want to go anywhere without you, Carmine.\u201d</p><p>They stared at each other, his green eyes a flurry of emotion. He wiped the tears from her cheeks before his fingertips brushed across her lips. She let out a shaky breath as he kissed her, finally let go of the papers. They dropped to the bed as she ran her fingers through his unruly hair.</p><p>\u201cTi amo,\u201d he whispered against her mouth. \u201cLa mia bella ragazza. I want you to marry me.\u201d</p><p>She gasped. \u201cMarry you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean today or tomorrow. It doesn\u2019t have to be this year or, fuck, next year. But someday, when you\u2019re ready, promise you\u2019ll spend your life with me?\u201d His words made her stomach flutter. \u201cLook, I know I\u2019m doing this shit all wrong, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Her voice cracked. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He stalled. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I will, Carmine!\u201d</p><p>His face lit up as he smashed his lips to hers feverishly, and she laughed into his mouth, kissing him back. The outside world melted away as his hands roamed her body, his fingertips causing sparks to ignite across her skin. Knowing she was free and had a life of her own, and that despite everything she\u2019d been in the past, he still wanted her for the future, made her insides burst into flames of passion.</p><p>It was early evening when Carmine pulled into a parking lot across from the dingy brick apartment building in the city. The old elevator vibrated as it took them to the sixth floor, and they headed down a narrow hallway to apartment sixty-seven.</p><p>Carmine reached up to knock, but the door opened before he could. Dia stood before them, wearing a pair of ripped jeans and a blue top, her hair a mixture of black and purple streaks. \u201cHappy birthday!\u201d</p><p>She ushered them inside, and Haven froze the moment she stepped into the front room. The walls were a cream color, the paint barely visible due to the hundreds of photographs wallpapering every inch. The apartment was decorated in colors so vibrant the large bunch of birthday balloons blended in. There were presents next to them and a small, round cake.</p><p>Gratitude and guilt battled for control. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be a buzzkill,\u201d Dia said, pulling her over to the table. Haven sat down as Carmine leaned against the wall and gazed at her.</p><p>Dia stuck candles into the cake and lit them, stepping off to the side to belt out the birthday song. Haven stared at the flickering flames, remembering to make a wish this time.</p><p>Please, she silently pleaded. Bring my mama back to me.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, Haven blew out the candles and watched the puffs of smoke rise from the smoldering wicks. Dia pulled them out before thrusting a present at her, making her flinch.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Dia said quickly. \u201cI\u2019m just excited for you to see it.\u201d</p><p>Haven opened the package and pulled out a small copper box with a glass window on the top of it. Inside the window was a four-leaf clover, along with red hearts and shiny silver beading.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a reliquary box,\u201d Dia said. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to store your favorite things in it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She smiled. \u201cI don\u2019t think Carmine will fit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so either,\u201d Carmine said, chuckling. \u201cNot even my dick would fit in that thing.\u201d</p><p>There were more presents to open, and afterward they ate the cake. The three of them watched movies and listened to music all night, the evening feeling more like a regular day than a celebration. Haven felt ridiculous for her anxiety over it all, grateful to be able to relax with friends.</p><p>Friends. It was still surreal to her that she had people in her life she could call friends.</p> <p>\u201cSo, have the two of you thought about what you\u2019re doing next year?\u201d Dia asked eventually. \u201cI\u2019m guessing you\u2019re not going to be staying in Durante much longer.\u201d</p><p>Haven glanced at Carmine, who just shrugged. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter to me. If she marries me, I\u2019ll follow her to the gates of Hell.\u201d</p><p>Dia had been taking a drink but choked, spraying soda all over herself. Coughing, she threw her hands into the air. \u201cDid you say marry you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou proposed?\u201d Dia jumped up and grabbed Haven\u2019s hand. \u201cWhere\u2019s the ring?\u201d</p> <p>Carmine groaned. \u201cI didn\u2019t have one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you at least get down on one knee?\u201d she asked. Carmine shook his head, and she smacked him on the arm. \u201cWhat kind of freaking proposal is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a real one,\u201d he said. \u201cI asked if she\u2019d marry me someday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s even worse!\u201d Dia tried to hit him again, but he was prepared and dodged the blow.</p><p>\u201cShit, stop hitting me. It\u2019s not like I planned it. It just came out.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cAll the planning you put into Valentine\u2019s Day, and you completely blow the proposal.\u201d</p> <p>He opened his mouth to respond, but Haven chimed in before he could. \u201cI don\u2019t need any of that stuff.\u201d</p><p>Carmine smirked. \u201cSee, Warhol? I didn\u2019t fuck up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou still could\u2019ve gotten down on one knee.\u201d</p><p>Carmine chuckled. \u201cWell, I may have gotten between her knees, if you know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>Rolling her eyes, Dia sat down. \u201cSo you banged. I\u2019m sure that was romantic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t bang,\u201d Carmine said. \u201cWe made love.\u201d</p><p>Carmine\u2019s presence was scarce the next two weeks, even more so than before. He would slip out of the house for school while Haven was still asleep and wouldn\u2019t get home from football practice until dinnertime. After they ate, the two of them would head upstairs, where Carmine did his homework before going straight to bed.</p><p>They didn\u2019t even sleep in the same room most nights anymore.</p> <p>Haven\u2019s shame grew as the days passed, and Carmine\u2019s demeanor shifted along with hers. Falling back into old patterns, he would lose his temper and lash out, and Haven would brush it off, despite that his words often hurt.</p><p>It was Friday evening, and Carmine\u2019s first game of the year. Haven\u2019s palms were sweaty when she climbed in the driver\u2019s seat of Dominic\u2019s car at around seven o\u2019clock. It\u2019s for Carmine, she told herself. No amount of people would get in her way of supporting him.</p><p>When she reached the school, the noise from the stadium could be heard from the parking lot, the announcer on the loudspeaker screeching above them all. She stood by the car, trying to gather the courage to move, when someone grabbed her shoulder. Her heart pounded furiously as she swung around, her hands protectively covering her face.</p><p>\u201cWhoa,\u201d Nicholas said. \u201cIt\u2019s just me.\u201d</p><p>She dropped her hands. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I have to want something? I figured I\u2019d walk you inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re hoping to hurt Carmine by having him see us together, you can just leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonestly, that hadn\u2019t crossed my mind, but now that you mention it . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood-bye, Nicholas.\u201d Her frustration was enough to make her legs finally move. She made it a few feet when she noticed a group of girls blocking the entrance, with Lisa in the center.</p><p>\u201cI thought you might like an escort past the firing squad,\u201d Nicholas said, walking up behind her. \u201cBut if you\u2019d rather go alone\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Sighing, he pressed his hand against her back. \u201cCome on, then.\u201d</p><p>She walked again, staring at the ground, and heard laughter as they approached the stadium.</p><p>\u201cPicking up Carmine\u2019s leftovers?\u201d Lisa asked. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize you were that desperate.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas shook his head. \u201cDo you even hear yourself? You used to be his main course. If I were desperate, I\u2019d be with you instead.\u201d</p><p>He pulled Haven toward the ticket booth and paid for his ticket, but she just stood there, frantic. She hadn\u2019t considered that she would need money. \u201cI, uh . . . I didn\u2019t think . . .\u201d</p><p>His brow furrowed as he reached for his wallet again. Tossing a few dollars at the lady working, he grabbed a second ticket and handed it to her. She tried to object, not wanting him to pay for her, but she had no other way to get in the game.</p><p>He led her to the bleachers, his walk more of a strut as he shoved his hands in the pockets of his cargo pants. His shoulders slumped, his dingy ball cap concealing his gaze as Haven scanned the crowd, spotting Dia in a center section.</p><p>Before she could thank Nicholas, he\u2019d already slipped away.</p><p>Haven headed up the bleachers, her nervousness waning as she took a seat beside Dia. Haven waved at Carmine on the sidelines, but he just stared at her from the field, expressionless. She wasn\u2019t surprised\u2014another one of his moods, she guessed. It was certainly nothing new these days.</p><p>The coach called his name, drawing his attention away, and he headed onto the field without another glance in her direction.</p><p>The spectators were as rowdy as Haven remembered from the year before, but this time she was more at ease in the crowd. Her body buzzed with excitement by the time the game came to a close, and Carmine ran straight for the locker rooms as the crowd descended upon the field.</p><p>Haven and Dia headed over to the grassy knoll to wait. She stood near the chain-link fence as Dia strolled around taking pictures.</p><p>A throat cleared as Nicholas leaned against the fence beside her. \u201cI know\u2014me again. I forgot to tell you a joke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo ahead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you hear\u2014?\u201d</p><p>Before he could finish, Carmine\u2019s harsh voice rang out, shouting Nicholas\u2019s name as he hastily approached. A chill shot down Haven\u2019s spine, her stomach dropping when she saw his hands clenched into fists. Nicholas took a step away. \u201cLook, I don\u2019t want any trouble.\u201d</p><p>Carmine laughed bitterly, shoving him. \u201cIf you didn\u2019t want any trouble, you wouldn\u2019t be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just talking to her, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what right do you have to do that, huh? Stop using her to get to me!\u201d</p><p>Nicholas glared at him. \u201cIf anyone\u2019s using her, it\u2019s you! It\u2019s sick what you\u2019re doing! You have her fooled into believing you care!\u201d</p><p>Carmine\u2019s fist connected with Nicholas\u2019s jaw at those words. His head snapped to the side from the blow, blood spurting from his mouth. He wiped it away, stunned, as Carmine shouted, \u201cStay the fuck away! She\u2019s mine, and I\u2019ll be damned if I\u2019ll let you take her from me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou possessive bastard! If you loved her, you wouldn\u2019t say things like that!\u201d</p><p>That set Carmine off. Pouncing, he knocked Nicholas to the ground as Haven clutched the fence and yelled for help. A group of boys intervened at the sound of the commotion, hauling them off the ground and separating the two. Dia forced her way through the crowd as she frantically looked around. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>Carmine ignored the question as he turned to glare at Haven. \u201cOut of everybody, why does it have to be him? Are you trying to hurt me? Is that what this shit is about?\u201d</p><p>She blinked a few times, stunned by his anger. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard me. I give you space, thinking that\u2019s what you want. And I get it, Haven. I fucking get it. You\u2019re hurt. But you can talk to him? You can smile at him? Is it me? If you don\u2019t want to be with me, tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do!\u201d His words stung. \u201cI love you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a fucking funny way of showing it,\u201d he spat. \u201cI\u2019ve changed my life for you. I\u2019d kill for you. Fuck, I\u2019d die for you! Just tell me what\u2019s wrong. Tell me what to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t?\u201d he asked with disbelief. \u201cYou don\u2019t get it, do you? You don\u2019t know what I\u2019ve given up for you. You don\u2019t know what I\u2019ve lost because of you!\u201d</p><p>Those words hit her hard. She gasped, everything clouding over as her hand shot out, striking him across the face. He cupped his cheek, the shock from the blow melting his anger. Haven covered her mouth before running for the exit, needing to think, needing to be away from him so she could make sense of what she\u2019d done.</p><p>She had hit him. Him. She was going to be sick.</p><p>Shoving past people, she hurried out of the stadium, fumbling in her pocket for the keys. A horn blared as she nearly backed into another car, and she slammed the brakes to let them pass, her hands violently shaking. Tears obstructed her vision as she pulled out onto the road and sped through the busy town.</p><p>She drove toward the house but was too scared to stop. Too scared to face it. Too scared to lose him. She passed the driveway, continuing down the highway in the dark. It took a few minutes for it to dawn on her where the road led, her shame reaching an all-time high when she drove past the sign that read WELCOME TO AURORA LAKE.</p><p>Haven pulled into the small lot and sat in silence for a moment, struggling to breathe. She felt like she had been sucked into a twister, the world spinning as her body shook. She climbed out of the car, thinking she\u2019d be sick, and forced the fresh air in her lungs as she stumbled toward the sand.</p><p>She ended up at a dock and strolled down it, glancing out at the lake. Moonlight reflected off the dark water, and she stared into the blackness, soothed by it.</p><p>Casual footsteps approached eventually. \u201cPlease don\u2019t jump. I really don\u2019t want to go in after you. It\u2019s probably cold.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at Nicholas\u2019s nonchalance. \u201cI\u2019m not going to jump.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he said as he stopped beside her, his lip busted, bruises already forming on his skin.</p><p>Haven frowned as she peeked at him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry he hit you for talking to me.\u201d</p><p>He waved her off. \u201cHe\u2019d never apologize, so don\u2019t do it for him.\u201d</p><p>She said nothing, staring back out at the water.</p><p>Nicholas sighed. \u201cI\u2019m surprised to see you here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d She was quiet for a moment, debating what to say. \u201cIt was my birthday.\u201c</p><p>\u201cReally? Well, happy birthday.\u201d</p><p>She smiled sadly before saying the words she had longed to say for days, ones she swallowed back whenever Carmine was near. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing happy about the day I was born.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>44</p><p>Carmine stared at the darkened house, clutching his phone to his ear.

She\u2019s afraid of me, Dia. Of me.\u201d</p> <p>He couldn\u2019t get the image out of his mind, the fear in her eyes as she ran from him.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t she know I understand how she feels?\u201d he asked. \u201cI lost my mom, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but you\u2019re irrational when it comes to talking about your mother\u2019s death.\u201d</p><p>Her words made his temper flare. \u201cVaffanculo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re proving my point,\u201d Dia said. \u201cLook, I\u2019ll call you back. I want to check something.\u201d</p> <p>She hung up without awaiting his response.</p><p>Carmine just stood there until Dia called him back. \u201cAny luck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s safe.\u201d</p><p>Relief washed through him so fast he nearly collapsed. \u201cWhere did you find her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s down at the lake.\u201d</p><p>He froze, grabbing the hood of his car as his legs went weak. Yeah, he was going to fucking collapse. \u201cWhat do you mean she\u2019s at the lake?\u201d Dia didn\u2019t respond, her silence all he needed for the truth to register. \u201cNicholas.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCalm down,\u201d she said before he had a chance to get worked up. She knew him well, which meant she also knew her words wouldn\u2019t work.</p><p>Carmine\u2019s anger spiraled out of control. \u201cCalm down? I\u2019m tired of this bullshit. If this is how she wants to be, they can have each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarmine . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is why I never wanted to fall in love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t mean that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t fucking tell me what I mean!\u201d Betrayal fueled his rage, and he threw his phone at the car, cursing as a lump formed in his throat. His vision clouded over as his hand clenched into a fist. He slammed it against the windshield, the glass on the passenger side cracking from the force of the blow. Desolation coursed through him as he did it again, the windshield caving as his fist broke through. Pain stung his knuckles, the jagged glass ripping the skin.</p><p>He took a deep breath as he went inside, his father greeting him in the foyer. The smile on Vincent\u2019s face fell when he took in Carmine\u2019s expression, his eyes drifting to his bloody hand. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNicholas happened.\u201d</p> <p>Vincent groaned. \u201cHow many times do we have to go through this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever. The Mazda took a worse beating than Nicholas did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour car? What happened tonight? Where\u2019s the girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already told you\u2014Nicholas happened,\u201d he spat. \u201cAnd her fucking name is Haven. Haven. Use it sometime.\u201d</p><p>Vincent stared at him, taken aback.</p><p>\u201cAnd if you wanna know where Haven is, find Nicholas. They\u2019re down at the lake somewhere.\u201d An idea hit him the moment he said that. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna go get her, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Vincent pinched the bridge of his nose. \u201cHer life is her own, Carmine. She can have friends, and you should respect that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter what he did to me, you expect me to respect him? I\u2019m supposed to like this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say you had to like it, nor did I say you should respect him, but you ought to respect her right to make her own choices, whether you like them or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not that big of an asshole. I tell her all the time to make her own decisions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you should see this as her doing that.\u201d</p><p>Groaning, Carmine pushed past his father and headed for the stairs. \u201cHow come no one\u2019s taking my side on this?\u201d</p><p>Vincent laughed, the sound hitting a nerve. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about choosing sides. I told you someday the real world would creep up on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I know it,\u201d he said. \u201cI knew it the moment she slapped me.\u201d</p><p>Vincent grinned. \u201cShe hit you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so fucking amusing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pleasantly surprised,\u201d he said. \u201cNot saying she should\u2019ve hit you, but I\u2019m shocked she\u2019d let go like that. She may make it out there in the world, after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEver heard of Stockholm syndrome?\u201d</p><p>Haven eyed Nicholas warily at those words. His legs dangled over the end of the dock, his pants rolled up and feet skimming the surface of the water. She sat cross-legged beside him, their discarded shoes scattered on the deck. \u201cNo, what is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s when someone gets mushy feelings for their kidnapper.\u201d</p><p>She sighed when she realized where he was going with it. \u201cI wasn\u2019t kidnapped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo the good doctor didn\u2019t cut out letters from a magazine and glue them together to make a colorful ransom note for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInteresting,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be a kidnapping, though. It\u2019s when someone being held hostage gets feelings for their captor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the same thing you said the first time. Besides, Carmine isn\u2019t holding me hostage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you are being held, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t not say it, either,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd sometimes people in that situation end up brainwashed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not brainwashed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know? Because \u2018I\u2019m not brainwashed\u2019 sounds suspiciously like something a brainwashed person would say.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cYou just don\u2019t want to believe Carmine\u2019s different now, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d he said, \u201cbut stop changing the subject. We\u2019re talking about you being kidnapped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you\u2014I wasn\u2019t kidnapped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I thought for sure you were, though. I was banking on you having parents out there searching for you.\u201d</p><p>Her chest tightened at his words. \u201cMy parents are dead.\u201d</p><p>She could feel his eyes on her, his stare intense, but she didn\u2019t dare look at him. After a moment he turned away and kicked the water again. \u201cMy mom\u2019s dead, too. She died when I was young. I still have my dad, but we don\u2019t get along. He always expects the worst from me, so I figure, why try to do right when he\u2019ll never see it? But I\u2019m eighteen now, so I may as well move out. Start over somewhere new, where people don\u2019t hear the name Nicholas Barlow and automatically think \u2018degenerate asshole.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think people look at you that way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know they do,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s worse now that Carmine\u2019s . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow that Carmine\u2019s what?\u201d she asked when he didn\u2019t finish. \u201cNow that he\u2019s different?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t respond, and that was answer enough for her. A smile tugged her lips. Maybe there was hope for a friendship, after all.</p><p>It was quiet, the only sounds being water splashing and crickets chirping in the night. Nicholas cleared his throat after a few minutes. \u201cDid I tell you the joke about the butter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe butterfly one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, the butter one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat butter one?\u201d</p><p>He groaned. \u201cYou\u2019re screwing up my punch line. Let\u2019s try it again\u2014did I tell you the joke about the butter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, no. I don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I butter not tell you,\u201d he said. \u201cYou might spread it.\u201d</p><p>He cut his eyes at her, grinning, but she just stared at him. \u201cSpread what?\u201d</p><p>Shaking his head, he looked away. \u201cIf it\u2019s the last thing I do, I\u2019ll get you to laugh at one of my jokes someday.\u201d</p><p> Carmine stood in the library by the window and stared out into the backyard. He wondered what Haven thought about as she sat there at night, or if her mind was as vacant as the blackness. He could faintly recall those months after his mom\u2019s death, so in the grips of heartbreak that attempting to hold a conversation took too much effort. It was like the life had been sucked out of him, his insides a bottomless pit of grief.</p><p>He spotted the book lying on the small table and grabbed it, surveying the blank cover before flipping it open. Sloppy handwriting covered the withered paper; confusion hit him when he realized it was a diary. Sickness brewed in his stomach when he opened it to the front, seeing Maura DeMarco written inside the cover. Closing the book again, he lost his breath. After everything he had done to shield Haven from the truth, she had stumbled upon it anyway.</p><p>He sprinted out of the library, pulling his keys from his pocket as he flew down the steps two at a time. Once he hit the second floor, his father stepped out of his office, the sound of frantic footsteps drawing his attention.</p><p>\u201cCarmine, wait!\u201d Vincent took a step toward him, but Carmine didn\u2019t stop. He went out the front door to his car, unlocking it as his father stepped onto the porch. \u201cDon\u2019t go there!\u201d</p><p>Carmine hesitated before starting the car. Haven had been gone for more than an hour, and there was no way he could let it go another minute.</p><p>Speeding down the highway in the darkness, he held his breath as he flew past the Aurora Lake sign, knowing he had reached the point of no return. He swung around a curve and slammed the brakes when he caught a glimpse of the Audi. The Mazda skidded to a stop beside it, and he jumped out, heading down toward the water. He jogged along the shore, searching for some sign of her, before spotting them sitting on the dock.</p><p>Nicholas\u2019s eyes fell on Carmine as he approached. Haven must have sensed him too, because her head snapped in his direction. She jumped up and recklessly took a step away, nearing the edge of the dock. Her foot skidded, but Nicholas grabbed her before she fell. \u201cWhoa, what did I tell you? I\u2019m not going in the water after you.\u201d</p><p>Carmine held up his hands. \u201cI\u2019m not here for a fight.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas looked at him suspiciously. \u201cWhat are you doing here? You know you aren\u2019t allowed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can press charges if you want. I just need to talk to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf she wanted to talk to you, she would\u2019ve gone to you. Can\u2019t you give her some space?\u201d</p><p>Carmine ran his hands down his face in frustration. \u201cIt\u2019s important. I\u2019ll leave, I will, but I need to talk to her first.\u201d He focused his attention on Haven. \u201cPlease, hummingbird?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to,\u201d Nicholas said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do anything you don\u2019t want to do.\u201d</p><p>Carmine glared at him but kept his mouth shut as Haven replied. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas glanced between them before gently rubbing Haven\u2019s arm. \u201cTake care. You know how to reach me if you need me.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes nervously flitted to Carmine as she said good-bye. He started toward Haven after Nicholas walked away. \u201cI know what you found.\u201d</p><p>A horrified expression flashed across her face. \u201cOh God.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She looked like she wanted to run from him again, so he reached out to stop her. \u201cI already knew it was you. I\u2019ve known for a few months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you didn\u2019t tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was trying to protect you. I didn\u2019t see the point in telling you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mama died because of me, and you didn\u2019t see the point? I destroyed your life, Carmine!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cChrist, you were just a little girl. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\u201d</p><p>Tears streamed down her cheeks. \u201cI took your mama from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you didn\u2019t. The person who pulled the trigger took her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong.\u201d She wiped her tears away. \u201cHow can you look at me? How could you love me after that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can I not? I\u2019d die for you, so how could I blame you for my mom feeling the same way?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t have happened,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not worth it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say shit like that. You can\u2019t shut down and pull away from everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you said\u2014\u201d</p><p>He cut her off before she could repeat the things he had said. \u201cI was angry. We all do shit when we\u2019re upset we don\u2019t mean. I\u2019ve lost too much as it is. I don\u2019t want to lose you too.\u201d She choked back a sob as he pulled her into a hug. \u201cFuck, tesoro. I don\u2019t know how we\u2019re gonna get over this, but we need to find a way. I\u2019m miserable without you.\u201d</p><p>He held her, comforted by having her in his arms again. She pulled from his embrace as her crying slowed and peered at him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry if I hurt you by talking to Nicholas. It\u2019s just . . . no matter his reasons, he went out of his way to try to make me laugh.\u201d</p><p>While Carmine questioned Nicholas\u2019s motives, he realized, as he stood there, that everyone had been right. He needed to respect her decisions; he had to let her make mistakes. \u201cYou know he fucking hates me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s angry, but he doesn\u2019t hate you. I think he misses you.\u201d</p><p>He laughed bitterly. \u201cHe says bad shit about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe does, but like you said\u2014we say things we don\u2019t mean when we\u2019re hurt. The two of you used to be close, and now you have me, but who does Nicholas have? I understand why he doesn\u2019t want to accept you\u2019ve changed, because he hasn\u2019t. He doesn\u2019t want to believe you\u2019re not the same, because that means he really is alone. He lost his only friend.\u201d</p><p>Heaps of paperwork surrounded Vincent. He\u2019d been sitting there for hours trying to get it knocked down, but he couldn\u2019t focus. He was exhausted, and everything was falling apart.</p><p>The office door thrust open as Vincent read the same paragraph for the fifth time, his son strolling into the room. \u201cYou\u2019re making my night hell, Carmine. You\u2019re lucky you didn\u2019t get arrested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have something that\u2019ll make it all better . . . or it\u2019s just gonna make your life worse.\u201d</p><p>Carmine dropped a book on top of the paperwork, knocking the pen right out of his hand. Vincent sighed. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t recognize my mom\u2019s diary?\u201d he asked. \u201cHaven found it in the library.\u201d</p> <p>He slumped into his chair, staring at the book in a daze. \u201cI suspected your mother kept one, but it never struck me it might\u2019ve been with the other books when Celia packed everything up in Chicago for me. I must\u2019ve stuck it on the shelf without realizing what it was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s where it was, so there you go.\u201d</p><p>After Carmine walked out, Vincent ran his hand over the worn cover before opening the book, his curiosity fueling him as he flipped to the last page. The familiar handwriting made him feel like someone had plunged a hand into his chest and gripped his heart, squeezing it.</p><p>He scanned the passage, seeing the date. October 12, 1997. She\u2019d written it the day she died.</p><p>The closet door in Carmine\u2019s room was stuck this morning. I had to break the knob to open the door. Another thing to add to the list . . . the bottom step is loose, the kitchen window won\u2019t budge most days, the tire swing fell down, and the front door is in desperate need of new paint. Such small things, one after another, all easily fixed but it doesn\u2019t feel that way. It feels like everything is falling apart around me, the world crumbling as I stand here, still. I think time has run out\u2014not for her, but for me. I\u2019ve hit a wall and it\u2019s too late to turn back. Not that I would, even if I could. Vincent doesn\u2019t understand right now, but someday he\u2019ll see what I see. Someday he\u2019ll realize why I couldn\u2019t give up on her. Maybe when that happens, he\u2019ll hang the tire swing again. Maybe the window will be replaced, the step nailed down, and maybe the door will be repainted. Blue this time, instead of red. I\u2019m tired of seeing so much red. Maybe then it\u2019ll be our time to have peace. And maybe then she\u2019ll finally be free. I think when that happens the world will stop crumbling.</p><p>Vincent closed the book. His world was still crumbling.</p><p>Haven stood by the kitchen window and gazed out into the driveway, her eyes fixated on the Mazda, the passenger side windshield buckled from Carmine\u2019s fist. Even from where she stood she could see the streak of blood from his knuckles.</p><p>\u201cI woke up alone.\u201d</p><p>The gritty voice rang out behind Haven, drawing her from her thoughts. She turned to see Carmine in the doorway. \u201cYou looked peaceful,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to disturb you.\u201d</p><p>She glanced at his hand, the bruising on his knuckles dark this morning.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d he said, noticing the attention. He flexed his fingers to prove his point, his jaw rigid as he fought back a grimace. His hand was clearly not fine, but she didn\u2019t argue with him.</p><p>They stared at each other in silence. There was so much that needed to be said, but Haven had no idea where to start. All of it was overwhelming. Her eyes filled with tears as she blurted out, \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d the same time Carmine spoke, echoing her words and distress.</p><p>He frowned. \u201cWhy are you sorry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re hurt,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI told you, Haven. My hand\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot your hand,\u201d she said. \u201cYou. I hurt you, and I didn\u2019t mean to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I did the same thing. I\u2019d be a hypocrite to blame you. I could\u2019ve stopped this before it started, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>She turned around, his apology making her feel worse. He was trying to reassure her when he was the one who needed to be comforted. He deserved to have the burden lifted from his shoulders, but she selfishly stood in silence, unable to find the words to ease his pain.</p><p>His bare feet slapped against the cold, hard floor as he shuffled over to her, pausing at the window. \u201cChrist, look at my car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said again.</p><p>\u201cYou have to stop apologizing,\u201d he said, startling her as he grabbed her hips. \u201cIt happened, it was fucked up, but it\u2019s over now. Dwelling on who hurt who isn\u2019t gonna make the shit go away. You can\u2019t hold grudges and expect anything to get better, because it won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what you\u2019ve done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been doing it for years, all the while wondering why my life was shitty. I\u2019m tired of repeating the same mistakes over and over again. It\u2019s time to accept what happened and forgive.\u201d</p><p>She was amazed by his sudden burst of maturity when less than twelve hours before he had been volatile. It was as if he\u2019d been completely crushed, defeated to the point that he had no will left to fight.</p><p>\u201cDoes that mean forgiving Nicholas too?\u201d</p><p>He went rigid. \u201cWhat does he have to do with this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said nothing would get better holding grudges so I figured\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou figured wrong. That\u2019s different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d she asked. \u201cYou said dwelling on stuff wouldn\u2019t help anything. It happened, but it\u2019s over, so it\u2019s time to move on. Right?\u201d</p><p>He stared at her. \u201cHe\u2019s an asshole, Haven. He hurts everything he touches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the same thing he says about you. He\u2019s wrong, and I\u2019ve told him, but maybe you are, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019m just saying maybe the two of you aren\u2019t that different, and maybe if you can put everything aside, you guys can\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what you\u2019re saying, and that\u2019s a lot of fucking maybes. It\u2019s not gonna happen, so there\u2019s no point talking about it. In fact, I don\u2019t wanna talk about him at all, ever.\u201d</p><p>She stopped talking, his tone telling her the subject was closed. The tension in the room mounted again, and she fought the urge to apologize for irritating him.</p><p>\u201cIl tempo guarisce tutti i mali,\u201d Carmine said, rubbing his chest where those words were inked on his flesh. \u201cWhen I first got the tattoo, I didn\u2019t believe it, but I do now. You can get over anything with enough time. I\u2019m not sure how much it\u2019s gonna take to work through this shit we have going on, but I have all the time in the world for you.\u201d</p><p>He wrapped his arms around her, and she closed her eyes as she hugged him. \u201cIf you didn\u2019t believe it, why\u2019d you get the tattoo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s something my mom used to say.\u201d He let out a curious laugh. \u201cReminds me of you and your random trivia. I don\u2019t know why it took me so long to see the similarities. It should\u2019ve been obvious that my mom had grown up like you.\u201d</p><p>Haven pulled away from him. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>He cut his eyes to her. \u201cWhich part?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mama was like me? You mean a slave?\u201d</p><p>He cringed at the word but nodded. \u201cI thought you knew. You saw the diary.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI only read the piece of paper that fell out of it, Carmine.\u201d</p><p>His eyes widened. \u201cI thought you read the whole thing. Hell, I would\u2019ve read it. I gave it to my father so I wouldn\u2019t be tempted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDr. DeMarco knows?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s known for years. It\u2019s no coincidence you ended up here.\u201d</p><p>All of a sudden, as she stood there in the kitchen, the fog lifted and everything became clear. The reason he bought her, the reason he was freeing her. Masters were supposed to take life away, yet he had done everything in his power to give her one instead . . . and he had done it all for the woman he loved.</p><p>That knowledge made it feel like the ground was moving.</p><p>Haven was in her room that afternoon when Carmine came in, clutching a large white envelope. \u201cYou have mail, tesoro.\u201d</p><p>She eyed him warily as he sat on the edge of the bed, handing the mail to her. The return address was from North Carolina Community Colleges. \u201cIs this . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour test results.\u201d</p><p>She stared at the envelope as she ran her finger along the seal.</p><p>\u201cAre you gonna open it or what?\u201d</p><p>The enthusiasm in Carmine\u2019s voice frazzled her. It was the first time she had put herself out there, and the thought of failing scared her. \u201cCan you do it for me?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He shook his head. \u201cYou should do it.\u201d</p><p>She carefully tore the flap and pulled out the paper. The actual scores meant nothing to her as she stared at the certificate attached to the transcript, the words HIGH SCHOOL EQUIVALENCY DIPLOMA etched along the top with a golden seal.</p><p>\u201cI passed?\u201d she asked, trying to hold back the excitement threatening to burst forth, but it was stronger than her. She threw herself at Carmine before he could get out a word, knocking him over. \u201cI passed!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did,\u201d he said. \u201cCan\u2019t say I\u2019m surprised. I knew you would.\u201d</p> <p>He kissed her slowly, softly, pure passion emanating from him. It was an innocent kiss, yet so much more. It was a kiss of redemption, of forgiveness and pride. It was a kiss that said no matter what may have happened in the past, there was still hope for the future.</p><p>Hope. It was a feeling she reveled in now, instead of cowering from as before. \u201cThank you for believing in me,\u201d she whispered against his mouth.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to thank me,\u201d he said, pulling back with a smile. \u201cAnd don\u2019t worry, because everything will work out. We\u2019re one step closer. You can go to college now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you? When are you going to test for college?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSoon,\u201d he said. \u201cI signed up before we went to California.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you excited?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t call the SATs thrilling, tesoro. I\u2019m just ready to get it over with. I need to fill out applications, so we need to figure out where we\u2019re going . . . especially if I\u2019m gonna try to play football. California? New York? Camelot? Emerald City? Take your pick.\u201d</p><p>She had no idea where half of those places were. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, think about it, okay? But not today. Today\u2019s for celebrating, not thinking. Look at where you were a year ago and look at you now. You\u2019re free, you have a degree, and we\u2019re in love and gonna make it through this shit even if it kills us.\u201d He paused, his brow furrowing as she laughed. \u201cYeah, that didn\u2019t make sense, but you get what I\u2019m saying. We haven\u2019t had a reason to celebrate in a while, so come on, get up, put on some decent clothes, and let\u2019s forget about all of this for a while and be. We don\u2019t get to just be enough.\u201d</p><p>She glanced down at the black pants and Durante High School football shirt she wore. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with my clothes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything I said and all you got from that is me telling you to change?\u201d he asked with amusement, pulling her to her feet. \u201cChange. Clothes, not you. I don\u2019t want you to ever change, but I\u2019m kinda tired of looking at that fucking shirt.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI like this shirt,\u201d she said defensively, his laughter filtering back in as he left the room.</p><p>45</p><p>Haven stayed busy during the days when Carmine was at school, but it was difficult for her not to dwell on things when alone. Guilt continued to gnaw away at her.</p><p>She awoke the third Saturday in September as Carmine got out of the shower. She lay still in bed and watched him as he tried his best not to disturb her. He stood in front of the closet, and even in the semidarkened room, she could make out the definition of his back muscles and the lines of his tattoos. His skin glowed in the faint light filtering in from the open bathroom door, mesmerizing her. Even his scar shimmied as he absentmindedly rubbed it.</p><p>If there was one image of Carmine DeMarco she never wanted to forget, it was this one\u2014him exposed and vulnerable, sneaking around his own bedroom in the dark. It was something few would ever see, but it was an image she couldn\u2019t bear to lose. Most people knew the selfish young boy, spoiled and irresponsible, but she was lucky enough to see Carmine for who he truly was. Completely stripped down to the core, a gentle soul despite his scarred exterior.</p><p>The quiet contentment he oozed when he thought no one was watching took her breath away. She loved him with every fiber of her being, and just the fact that, after everything, he could still stand in front of her as he was spoke volumes.</p><p>He sighed and slipped on some clothes before grabbing a pair of Nikes from his closet. He kicked the corner of the bed as he walked by and cursed profusely under his breath. Haven tried to stifle her laughter but failed, his head snapping in her direction when he heard her.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you been awake?\u201d he asked, sitting down to slip on the shoes.</p> <p>\u201cA few minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you were what, watching me get dressed?\u201d He playfully nudged her with his elbow. She blushed, hoping he couldn\u2019t see it in the darkness, but nothing escaped his notice. \u201cYeah, you were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t help it. You\u2019re too beautiful not to watch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re half-asleep and don\u2019t know what the fuck you\u2019re saying.\u201d He kissed her as he stood. \u201cI have to go or I\u2019m gonna be late for this fucking test.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood luck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, tesoro. I\u2019ll see you in a few hours.\u201d</p><p>She listened as his footsteps descended the stairs, an odd feeling overcoming her. It felt like all the happiness had been sucked from the room.</p><p>Haven had made her way down to the kitchen and poured a glass of juice when a door closed somewhere on the first floor. She tensed instinctively as footsteps started in her direction. Relax, she told herself. It\u2019s only Dr. DeMarco.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d he said when he walked in.</p><p>It was the most he had spoken to her in days. \u201cMorning, sir.\u201d</p><p>He appeared disheveled, dark circles under his eyes. He was worn down by life, and Haven wondered, as she gazed at him, how much of that she\u2019d caused.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m leaving for Chicago. Do you need anything before I go?\u201d</p><p>The Mazda was in the body shop getting fixed, so Carmine had been driving the Audi around. \u201cI\u2019m fine, thank you.\u201d</p><p>Dr. DeMarco departed a few minutes later, while Haven spent the morning dusting the same things she dusted every other day that week. It was sometime after eleven, and she was cleaning out the pantry when a vehicle pulled up outside. Walking to the window, Haven gazed out at the unfamiliar blue car in the driveway.</p><p>The driver\u2019s side door opened, and Jen, the nurse from the hospital, stepped out. Haven headed for the foyer, but the sound of the doorbell ringing stopped her dead in her tracks. Something about it sent a chill down her spine, coldness radiating through her so quickly she thought she would be sick.</p><p>Something wasn\u2019t right. She could feel it.</p><p>She grabbed the phone from the family room, hesitating before pressing the speed dial for Dr. DeMarco\u2019s cell phone. Leaning against the wall, she waited while it rang.</p><p>\u201cIs everything okay?\u201d Dr. DeMarco asked. She had never called him before. She never thought she would have to. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>The doorbell rang again, making her flinch. \u201cI\u2019m not sure, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that the door? Is someone there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the nurse you work with. I was going to answer, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said sharply, his tone frightening her into immediate silence. The doorbell rang a few times in succession before Jen knocked on the door. \u201cDon\u2019t answer it, child. Get a hold of Carmine. I don\u2019t want you alone right now.\u201d</p><p>Something was definitely wrong if Dr. DeMarco sensed it.</p><p>\u201cSet the alarm. The code\u2019s 62373.\u201d</p><p>She already knew it, but Haven wasn\u2019t going to say anything.</p><p>Hanging up, Haven clutched the phone as she tiptoed to the door, punching in the code and pressing the button to activate the alarm. Jen stopped knocking after a moment, her muffled voice carrying through the door as Haven pressed her ear to it to listen. \u201cWhat do you want me to do? She isn\u2019t answering . . . Yes, I\u2019m sure she\u2019s there . . . Doc left this morning like he was supposed to.\u201d</p><p>There was a pause as Haven\u2019s heart pounded furiously. They wanted her?</p><p>\u201cNo, she\u2019s not with him. He\u2019s taking that test, remember?\u201d Jen continued, the distress in her voice alarming. \u201cI know, but please don\u2019t be mad! I promise I\u2019ll make this work. I know what it means to you.\u201d</p><p>Haven\u2019s knees nearly gave out as Jen pounded again. \u201cHello? Are you in there?\u201d</p><p>Haven scampered over to the side, huddling in the corner as she dialed Carmine\u2019s number on speed dial. It went straight to voice mail, and Haven let out a shaky breath.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to break in if you don\u2019t answer this door!\u201d Jen yelled, her demeanor turning from eagerness to anger. \u201cI\u2019ll be damned if I\u2019m going to let you ruin this for me!\u201d</p><p>Jen beat on the windows as Haven looked back down at the phone. Without hesitation, her fingers dialed the number that popped into her head: 555\u20130121.</p><p>She had stared at the paper with the phone number so much it had been burned into her mind. It rang as she curled into herself, fighting to keep her composure.</p><p>The phone was picked up after the fourth ring, the voice tentative. \u201cUh, hello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNicholas.\u201d She spoke as quietly as she could. \u201cIt\u2019s Haven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaven? Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Well, at least, I think I am, but I need help and I don\u2019t know who else to ask. Dr. DeMarco told me to get ahold of Carmine, but his phone isn\u2019t on. He broke it, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo . . . you\u2019re calling me instead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, \u201cto find him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, you want me to track down your boyfriend?\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cYes, I need him to come home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you think this is a good idea? No offense, but I\u2019m not in the mood for another fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but it\u2019s important. Please? He\u2019s taking a test at the high school. The SAT thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, you not only want me to tell Carmine what to do, but you want me to trespass on school property and drag him out of the SAT? He\u2019s going to kill me. I\u2019m going to die today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll understand,\u201d she said as Jen wiggled the knob of the front door.</p><p>Glaring at the paper on his desk, Carmine read the last question for the twentieth time, but he was no closer to an answer than he had been five minutes ago.</p><p>He groaned as he slouched in the hard plastic chair, shifting position to get comfortable. The girl beside him shot him an annoyed look, and he cocked an eyebrow at her, daring her to say something. She huffed dramatically before focusing back on her test. He stared at her, unable to place her name.</p><p>Michelle? Mandy? Monique? He couldn\u2019t fucking remember.</p><p>She cut her eyes at him again and mouthed, \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d he said, turning to his paper. He didn\u2019t care about her. He barely noticed anyone anymore. They were all the same, and there wasn\u2019t a single thing any of them could do for him. Haven was everything he wanted, the reason he sat in this room, stressing over this ridiculous test, so he could take her away and start a new life somewhere.</p><p>The administrator announced there were five minutes left, and Carmine sighed loudly as he read the question once more. He tried to wrap his brain around the analogies, but he didn\u2019t know what half the words meant. He gave up and dropped the pencil, not bothering to answer. The only analogy that mattered was weed is to smoke, as pussy is to fuck, because that was the only thing that would ease his nerves today. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>After the tests were collected, Carmine headed for the exit, rolling his neck to get the tension out of it. He strolled out to the parking lot with the rest of his classmates, where the sound of squealing tires stopped him in his tracks. He looked up, his brow furrowing in confusion when the old pickup truck pulled into the parking lot.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that Nicholas?\u201d</p><p>Carmine cringed as Lisa spoke behind him. Nicholas parked his truck and climbed out, glancing around in a rush. He looked in Carmine\u2019s direction, muttering to himself as he approached. \u201cCarmine, I need to talk to you about Haven. She\u2014\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t have time to finish before Carmine swung. Nicholas\u2019s head snapped to the side when the fist connected. Staggering backward, Nicholas glared at him. \u201cThere\u2019s something wrong with you! I told her you\u2019d go psycho if I came here!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d Carmine grabbed Nicholas\u2019s shirt. \u201cWhen did you talk to her?\u201d</p><p>Nicholas pried his hands off, shoving Carmine away. \u201cTwenty minutes ago when she called me.\u201d</p><p>The words stung. \u201cWhat do you mean she called you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean\u2014ring, ring\u2014she called my phone,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat else would \u2018she called me\u2019 mean?\u201d</p><p>Carmine lunged at him, but Nicholas was prepared this time. He barely stumbled before striking back, jabbing Carmine hard in the ribs. He gasped at the unexpected shot. Before he could recover, Nicholas struck him in the nose. Carmine\u2019s vision blurred as sharp pain shot through his face, blood flowing instantly. Someone grabbed his arm before he could get his wits about him, and he turned to see that a crowd had formed.</p> <p>Carmine wiped his face with the back of his hand, smearing blood all over himself. He grabbed the bottom of his shirt and pinched his nose with it, trying to stop the bleeding.</p><p>\u201cYou know, you\u2019d think you\u2019d show some damn gratitude,\u201d Nicholas said. \u201cI didn\u2019t have to come here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you? You\u2019re wasting your time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I am, but I came here because Haven asked me to. She didn\u2019t have anyone else, and she needed you to come home. I try to do her a favor, and instead of listening, you\u2019d rather fight for no reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did she ask you to get me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think someone was there or something.\u201d</p> <p>Carmine tensed. \u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I heard a doorbell.\u201d</p><p>Carmine pushed past Nicholas and sprinted for the car. His father was leaving town, so no one should have been at the house. He sped through the streets of Durante, trying to figure out who it could be. Salvatore? Had La Cosa Nostra come again?</p><p>Fresh skid marks aligned the driveway when he arrived home, ruts dug into the path, but there weren\u2019t any cars in the yard, the house as quiet as he\u2019d left it hours before.</p><p>Parking near the porch, Carmine climbed out and looked around, nothing raising any red flags. He unlocked the door and disabled the alarm when it beeped, his blood running cold when he saw the phone lying on the floor in the foyer. Glancing around suspiciously, he tried to remain calm as he made his way upstairs. He didn\u2019t find Haven on the third floor, so he slipped into his bedroom and pulled his gun from the top of his closet. He had hidden it there before he dropped the Mazda off to be fixed, not wanting to carry it in his brother\u2019s car. After checking to make sure it was loaded, he slipped the pistol into his waistband and went back down to the first floor.</p><p>His footsteps echoed in the house as he headed toward the kitchen, stopping in the doorway. Haven stood behind the island, her arm drawn back as she clutched a rolling pin. Carmine could see her trembling from where he stood.</p><p>If he hadn\u2019t been confused, he might have found it amusing. \u201cAre you okay, tesoro?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cAre you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, why wouldn\u2019t I be?\u201d</p><p>She blinked a few times and continued to gaze at him. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t I be asking that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but your nose . . .\u201d</p><p>Carmine grabbed his nose, wincing. He\u2019d forgotten about his injury. \u201cHad a little scuffle with Nicholas.\u201d</p><p>She gasped. \u201cYou didn\u2019t hurt him, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he got me this time.\u201d He cringed, not wanting to admit that. \u201cWhy did you call him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJen was here. Dr. DeMarco told me to call you. You didn\u2019t answer, and she was upset I wouldn\u2019t open the door, so I called him.\u201d</p><p>His phone hadn\u2019t worked since he had thrown it at his car. \u201cSo, did Jen give up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. She threatened me and said\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe threatened you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but she left, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck did she want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I looked outside and\u2014\u201d</p><p>Her words faltered as the roar of an engine approached. Carmine stepped over to the window, seeing the truck pulling up out front. \u201cIt\u2019s Nicholas.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas headed for the house as Carmine went into the foyer and opened the door.</p><p>\u201cEverything cool?\u201d Nicholas asked, stopping a few feet away.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Carmine said. \u201cYou\u2019re not needed here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarmine,\u201d Haven scolded as she stepped past him. Her eyes darted around as she stepped off the porch and loosely wrapped her arms around Nicholas in a hug. \u201cThank you. Not many people would\u2019ve done that for me.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas stood frozen before halfheartedly patting her back. \u201cAh, no big deal,\u201d he said, but it was a big deal. Carmine almost felt bad for hitting him, but the throbbing in his nose counteracted any guilt. \u201cSo, crisis averted and all that jazz?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was Jen,\u201d Carmine said. \u201cMy father must\u2019ve kicked her to the curb. You know how scorned bitches are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe always was shady,\u201d Nicholas said. \u201cI never understood why he\u2019d stoop that low. Even I wouldn\u2019t touch her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit,\u201d Carmine said. \u201cYou slept with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you did. We were at the hospital last year, and I dared you to do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you forgetting you tried to kill me that weekend? I never had a chance to try!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t try to kill you. If I wanted to kill you, I\u2019d kill you. I only snapped because you stabbed me in the back.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas glared at him. When he finally spoke, he said the last thing Carmine expected to hear. \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>He raised his eyebrows. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said you\u2019re right. I shouldn\u2019t have said what I said, and I\u2019m sorry about that, but you screwed up too, Carmine.\u201d</p><p>It was the first time Nicholas had ever acknowledged he had wronged him, and it caught Carmine off guard. \u201cYeah, I probably shouldn\u2019t have gotten with your sister. I\u2019m so\u2014uh, shit, whatever.\u201d</p><p>Haven eyed the two of them in shock. \u201cWow, are you\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyway.\u201d Carmine cut her off before she could make a big deal out of it. \u201cEverything\u2019s fine. Haven could\u2019ve handled it. She had the rolling pin ready to whoop some ass.\u201d</p><p>The phone in the house rang, and Carmine ran to the foyer to grab it off the floor. He answered it as he stepped out onto the porch. \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarmine?\u201d Vincent\u2019s voice cracked a bit. \u201cCan you hear me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, I have a joke for you,\u201d Nicholas said, turning to Haven. Carmine rolled his eyes as his father said something about the airport, but the reception grew worse and Nicholas\u2019s voice drowned him out. \u201cWhat\u2019s black, white, and red all over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Haven said. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>A loud bang rang out in the distance. Carmine accidentally dropped the phone and cursed, reaching down to pick it up, when a piercing scream cut through the air. The hair on Carmine\u2019s arms bristled as he spun around in time to see Nicholas drop to his knees, red seeping onto his white shirt. Clutching his chest, he opened his mouth to speak, but no sound came out. He dropped forward to the ground within a matter of seconds.</p><p>Haven screamed again, so loudly Carmine\u2019s ears rang.</p><p>Everything felt like it happened in slow motion. He jumped off the porch and landed on top of Haven as another bang shattered the air. He knocked her to the ground behind the car, his body weight forcing the air from her lungs.</p><p>\u201cListen to me,\u201d he said, pinning her trembling body there as she struggled to breathe. \u201cI\u2019m gonna count to three and start shooting back. I need you to get in the damn car. Got it?\u201d</p><p>She was unresponsive as another shot rang out. Carmine winced as it collided with metal, the bullet striking the car. \u201cChrist, Haven, you need to fucking listen to me. I need you to do this, so can you?\u201d</p><p>Her voice shook as hard as her body. \u201cI think so.\u201d</p><p>Carmine reached up and opened the passenger door a crack. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be fine.\u201d</p><p>Yet another gunshot cut through the stifling air. He flinched at the sound and took a deep breath. They were taunting them, he realized. Whoever it was could have easily killed them both by now.</p><p>He started counting, and Haven\u2019s eyes widened as she clutched him. \u201cWait!\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist, we don\u2019t have time to fuck around here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d The words caught in her throat and escaped as a sob. The sound of it burned, like she had taken a knife and plunged it straight into his chest, twisting it.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t act like we won\u2019t see each other again in thirty seconds,\u201d he said, grabbing his gun from his waistband. \u201cGet in the goddamn car, baby. Three.\u201d</p><p>He stood and aimed at nothing in particular, firing off rounds in the direction the shots had come from. Running to the driver\u2019s side, he cursed when he tripped over Nicholas. Shame overwhelmed him as tears stung his eyes, but he fought to hold himself together for Haven\u2019s sake.</p><p>Bullets whizzed by him as he ducked inside the car. Haven curled into a ball in the passenger seat, sobbing. He fumbled with the keys as he laid the gun down between them.</p><p>He threw the car in gear and swung it around, slamming the gas to get away from the house. He reached over and brushed Haven\u2019s hair aside to get a good look at her as he flew down the driveway. \u201cAre you okay, tesoro? Talk to me, please.\u201d</p><p>She flinched when he touched her. \u201cNicholas! We can\u2019t leave Nicholas!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have to,\u201d Carmine said. \u201cIt\u2019s too late for him.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head hysterically. \u201cBut he was just helping!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, hummingbird.\u201d He swung the car onto the main road. He wasn\u2019t sure what else to say. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>He tried to focus on the road, but something caught his eye in the rearview mirror. A black car sped straight for them. \u201cFuck.\u201d</p><p>Haven glanced behind them. \u201cOh God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPut on your fucking seatbelt,\u201d he said. She froze for a split second before snapping it on. Carmine wanted to say something to comfort her, but he wasn\u2019t sure those words even existed. The vehicle rapidly approached as gunshots cut through the air again, bullets hitting the back of the car. The right rear tire blew out as it was struck, the car jolting, but Carmine managed to keep it on the road. A moment later the left tire shredded, the screech of metal rim against the highway drowning out the sound of gunfire. Sparks flew, and Carmine\u2019s panic deepened when he realized they couldn\u2019t outrun them now. He grasped the steering wheel to brace himself and looked at Haven, unparalleled devastation reflecting in her eyes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCarmine,\u201d she said. The sound of his name on her lips made his chest swell with love despite the fear. Nothing would ever overpower it. He stared into her deep brown eyes, and it seemed as if time stopped. It always would, he realized. Carmine\u2019s world wouldn\u2019t go on without her.</p><p>\u201cI love you, too,\u201d he said, struggling to fight back the emotion so as not to scare her. \u201cSempre.\u201d</p><p>The moment he said the word, the black sedan rammed the back of their car. They skidded off the side of the road toward some trees. Carmine threw his hands out instinctively to protect Haven, knowing it was too late to stop it. He thrust forward and hit the steering wheel, pain ripping through his chest as the air left his body.</p><p>Blackness stole him instantly.</p> <p>46</p><p>The airbag deployed with a loud pop, silencing Haven\u2019s screams as her seatbelt locked into place. Slamming into it, she gasped for air, unable to take a breath until it deflated. She glanced at the driver\u2019s side, her chest on fire as she tore off her seatbelt. Carmine was slumped forward, his airbag splattered with blood from his face. Haven screamed his name, pawing at him, trying to find some sign of life, and she cried out with relief as he took a shaky breath.</p><p>The slam of a car door nearby alarmed Haven. The black sedan was parked alongside the road, everything hitting Haven at once as four men approached, all of them shrouded in black masks.</p><p>They were a blur in her panicked state, their rapid approach severing any grip she might have had on herself. She considered trying to run, but she wouldn\u2019t leave Carmine when he couldn\u2019t fend for himself. \u201cCarmine, I need you! Please!\u201d</p><p>Her distress skyrocketed as the men neared, their voices muffled to her ears. Glancing around the front seat, she spotted Carmine\u2019s gun on the floorboard. Her heart pounded vigorously. She hesitated for a split second before grasping it with trembling hands.</p> <p>Someone appeared at the driver\u2019s side, and Haven pulled the trigger as a reflex. It sounded like an explosion in the confined space, and she yelped, remembering to keep a grip on the gun so it didn\u2019t slip out of her hand. The bullet shattered the driver\u2019s side window and grazed the man\u2019s face. He grasped his cheek and turned as someone screamed, the man behind him dropping to the ground a few feet away.</p><p>The first man ripped off his mask as he spun back around, and Haven shrieked when she recognized Nunzio. He whipped out his pistol and reached into the window, grabbing Carmine by the hair. Yanking his head back, Nunzio pointed the gun to his temple the same time the passenger door opened and a gun pressed to the back of her head.</p><p>The person behind her spoke, his voice heavily accented. \u201cDrop the fucking gun, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>She let go of it instantly as the man grabbed her arm and dragged her out of the car. He threw her to the ground and picked up the weapon, checking it as Nunzio slammed Carmine\u2019s head against the steering wheel.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she screamed, feeling sick as the word rolled from her lips. \u201cPlease don\u2019t hurt him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Nunzio said as the man tossed him Carmine\u2019s gun. \u201cDid your boyfriend teach you how to use this thing? I never understood what Sal saw in him. Principe della Mafia, the future of the organization. He doesn\u2019t have the brains for this.\u201d</p> <p>He glared at her, an eerie silence surrounding them as Nunzio slipped Carmine\u2019s gun into his coat. \u201cGet her up. We don\u2019t have time to dick around.\u201d</p><p>The man yanked Haven to her feet and pulled her toward their car. She hyperventilated, frantically looking for some way to escape.</p><p>\u201cWhat about him?\u201d a third man asked, glancing at their partner on the ground. His voice also carried an accent.</p><p>\u201cLeave him,\u201d Nunzio said. \u201cI would\u2019ve killed him, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the kid? DeMarco?\u201d</p><p>Haven\u2019s heart felt like it stopped in that instant, pain radiating out through every inch of her body. She screamed and tried to pull away, fear making her knees buckle. The man\u2019s grasp slipped, and she collapsed, sobbing. \u201cPlease don\u2019t kill him! I\u2019ll go with you, I will! I won\u2019t fight! Just don\u2019t hurt him!\u201d</p><p>Devastation consumed her when the man drew his gun and pointed it at Carmine. She let out a shriek, the sound originating somewhere down inside of her soul and resonating so loudly her own ears rang. Both men in front of her recoiled from the sound as something hard slammed into the back of her head, the force silencing her.</p><p>\u201cShut the fuck up,\u201d the man with the thick accent said, followed by another strong blow that knocked her forward.</p> <p>\u201cPlease!\u201d she screamed again through the pain, not caring what happened to her as long as they didn\u2019t touch Carmine. He was still alive, and she needed him to stay that way. \u201cI\u2019ll do anything! Don\u2019t shoot him!\u201d</p><p>A foot slammed into her side, and she whimpered, trying to catch her breath.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough,\u201d Nunzio said. \u201cWe need her in one piece. Just leave DeMarco before she gives me a headache.\u201d</p><p>The guy lowered his gun as Nunzio pulled her to her feet, eyeing her so intently her skin crawled. He pulled her close to him and leaned down, his nose grazing her cheek. She could smell the blood on his face as he smeared it against her. \u201cHe\u2019ll die soon, anyway.\u201d</p><p>She held her breath, revolted, and collapsed to the ground when he let her go.</p><p>\u201cPut her in the car,\u201d Nunzio said, walking away. Arms wrapped around her waist and dragged her toward the road. She could faintly make out Carmine\u2019s body slumped over in the car, the sight of him crippling the last of her resolve. She screamed his name, desperately hoping he would hear her and wake up.</p><p>The man covered her mouth to silence her, and she panicked, biting down on his hand. Her teeth tore his flesh, repulsive blood filling her mouth. He pulled away enough to give her a chance to slip from his grasp. She spat and ran for the car but was grabbed as soon as she made it to the driver\u2019s side.</p><p>\u201cI thought you were going to play nice?\u201d Nunzio asked, dragging her back to their vehicle. He forced her into the backseat as the others climbed in, tires squealing as they drove away.</p><p>Nunzio grabbed a small pouch and unzipped it, pulling out a needle full of clear liquid. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame I have to do this.\u201d</p><p>She gasped as his hand grasped her around the throat. She struggled, slamming her fists into him as hard as she could, trying to knock the needle out of his hand. He jabbed it into her thigh and held her tightly for a minute longer as she faded, slipping into unconsciousness.</p><p>\u201cCarmine?\u201d</p><p>The sound of his name registered in Carmine\u2019s ears, but the voice was muddled and sounded far away. It was familiar, though, and he strained to hear.</p><p>\u201cCarmine, open your eyes.\u201d</p><p>Everything was black but oddly hazy, like he was submerged under water or in a thick fog.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d the voice said, clearer than before. He recognized his father and tried to respond, but he couldn\u2019t get words to form, strangled moans vibrating his chest.</p><p>\u201cWake up, son,\u201d Vincent said. \u201cThis is important.\u201d</p><p>Carmine forced his eyes open but winced at the pain radiating from his head. He groaned as he moved, the stabbing feeling spreading with each attempt. His distorted vision blurred everything.</p><p>He was still in the car, the front end wedged against some trees. Smoke and heat still filtered from under the hood, so he couldn\u2019t have been unconscious too long. He saw his father standing beside the driver\u2019s side door and made a move to get out, but Vincent stopped him. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t move. You\u2019re injured.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Carmine said, unsure if that was true. He climbed out and grasped the side of the car to stabilize himself, his legs wobbly. He felt sick right away and hunched over, vomiting.</p><p>\u201cYou have a serious concussion,\u201d Vincent said. \u201cProbably some fractured ribs. Looks like a broken nose and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuit fucking diagnosing me,\u201d he said. \u201cWhere\u2019s Haven?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hoped you could tell me. I was on my way back to the house and saw the car here.\u201d</p><p>Carmine\u2019s panic flared. \u201cI, uh . . . She was with me. We were at the house and someone started shooting. Nicholas got hit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNicholas? Where is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill at the house. I had to leave him and get the fuck out of there.\u201d He fought back his guilt, unsure of which hurt worse\u2014the emotional anguish or the physical pain. \u201cWe were trying to get away, but a car ran up on us, and here we are. Or, fuck, here I am. Where is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll find her,\u201d Vincent said. Carmine wondered how he could be calm, and froze when something a few yards behind him caught his attention. His heart pounded forcefully when he realized it was a person.</p><p>His father glanced in that direction. \u201cJohnny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJohnny? Who the fuck is Johnny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNobody important. I\u2019m not even certain that\u2019s his name. He\u2019s part of Giovanni\u2019s street crew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of your own?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has a gunshot wound to the abdomen, but it\u2019s not necessarily fatal,\u201d Vincent said. \u201cMissed his major organs, but I\u2019m venturing a guess it hit his spinal cord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA gut shot? I thought you shot to kill?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t shoot him,\u201d he said, shaking his head. \u201cI hoped you could tell me who did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou found him there?\u201d Carmine stared at his father, bewildered, before turning to the car. The passenger side door was open and the seatbelt was unlatched, so he didn\u2019t think Haven could have been too hurt in the accident. There wasn\u2019t any blood on her side.</p><p>\u201cMaybe she went for help,\u201d he said, tossing things around. \u201cWhere\u2019s my gun?\u201d</p><p>The moment he said it, he spotted the single .45-caliber cartridge on the passenger side floorboard. He picked it up and got back out of the car, eyeing it as his father sighed. \u201cI had a feeling something like this would happen\u2014even before I knew she was related to Sal. After everything I lost, I knew saving her wouldn\u2019t be easy. They all knew how important it was to me. I was afraid someone would take her for leverage. I should\u2019ve known it would be him.\u201d</p><p>Carmine\u2019s legs wobbled. \u201cNunzio?\u201d</p><p>Vincent nodded. \u201cNo one has heard from him in days. He was called in for a sit-down and didn\u2019t show. It was the reason I was going to Chicago this weekend.\u201d</p><p>Carmine felt the bile rising up. The thought of her being somewhere with Nunzio sickened him. He couldn\u2019t begin to imagine what she was going through.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll kill him,\u201d Carmine said. \u201cHe\u2019ll pay for this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe will,\u201d Vincent said. \u201cBut right now, we need to be more concerned with finding her.\u201d</p><p>It turned out to be a brisk night, a storm rolling in from the west making the waters of Aurora Lake more turbulent than usual. Vincent stood at the end of a long pier a few miles from the Barlow residence, huddled up in his coat as he tried to shield himself from the harsh winds.</p><p>Vincent could easily recall the first time he met Nicholas, a warm fall day at the local elementary school. Carmine had just turned ten, and it was the first time Vincent had made it to one of his football games. Between juggling his job at the hospital and managing his work with la famiglia, he had little time left over for his children. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But that day, he had snuck out of work early to watch. Toward the middle of the game, a scrawny boy with tanned skin took a nasty spill, and someone\u2019s cleat gashed his cheek. It was a superficial wound, so Vincent grabbed a first-aid kit from the car, sparing the boy a trip to the emergency room. \u201cThanks, Doc,\u201d he\u2019d said. \u201cOh, what did the doctor say when the invisible man asked for an appointment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, but I can\u2019t see you today.\u201d He laughed hysterically at his joke. \u201cGet it? Can\u2019t see you? You know, because he\u2019s invisible!\u201d</p><p>Vincent smiled. \u201cI get it.\u201d</p> <p>Halftime began as he finished fixing the boy\u2019s wound, and Carmine ran over. \u201cDad! You came!\u201d</p><p>Intense guilt hit him. \u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>Carmine threw his arm around the boy\u2019s shoulder. \u201cThis is my best friend, Nicholas.\u201d</p><p>Those words caught Vincent off guard. Carmine\u2019s teachers all reported the same thing\u2014he was closed off and shut down, so much so that it was as if he weren\u2019t there.</p><p>Vincent\u2019s pager went off as he stood there, the moment lost in that split second as the beeps rang out. The sparkle in Carmine\u2019s eye dissipated, the child Vincent had grown accustomed to returning without a single word spoken.</p> <p>But all hope was not lost, Vincent realized, because Carmine had someone. Someone he could be Carmine around\u2014the young, innocent boy, haunted by demons others couldn\u2019t see.</p><p>After their fallout, he watched his son spiral out of control. He was walking down the one path Vincent wanted him to stay far away from\u2014the path leading straight to Chicago. But then she happened. The girl who had never been able to call her life her own taught a boy who had the world at his fingertips exactly what it meant to live. He wasn\u2019t alone anymore.</p><p>Nicholas, however, was.</p><p>Vincent never forgot the joke he had told him that first day, because Nicholas was a lot like the invisible man. Drifting his way through life, unnoticed by most. Vincent saw him, though, even if he couldn\u2019t fix him. And as he stood on that pier under the cloak of darkness, he wished he would have done something more to help.</p><p>He gazed down at the water, fixated on the spot where Nicholas\u2019s body had disappeared moments before, and felt nothing but disgust. He had watched the boy grow up and had now sent him to a watery tomb like many of his adversaries.</p><p>\u201cOggi uccidiamo, domani moriremo,\u201d he said, his gloved hand making the sign of the cross. Today we kill, tomorrow we die.</p> <p>Vincent headed to his car hidden in the trees, and he drove away from Aurora Lake without looking back. He had already cleaned up the house, having hosed down the driveway and redistributed the gravel to hide all signs of the incident, but he had bigger issues he needed to deal with.</p><p>As soon as Vincent made it home, he slipped inside the room under the stairs and headed down into the basement. The place was cleaned out, the crates relocated elsewhere, so he had no problem navigating the room. He reached the large bookcase along the back and opened a metal electrical box on the wall beside it. He slid a section of panel down, revealing a small keypad, and punched in the numbers 62373.</p><p>There was a loud click. He slid the panel up, closing the electrical box as the bookshelf shifted a few inches. The door led into a safe room, or what his youngest referred to as the dungeon. The room, not much larger than a prison cell, had steel reinforced walls layered with bulletproof Kevlar.</p><p>It was the kind of room few men went into and even fewer came back out of alive.</p><p>He flicked a switch along the side, and fluorescent lights lit up the small space. He squinted and blocked out the blinding glare with his hand. Groans rang out from the corner where Johnny lay shackled to a table on the concrete floor.</p><p>\u201cVincent.\u201d The voice was barely audible. \u201cHelp me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d Vincent said, \u201cbut first you\u2019re going to help me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t move. I can\u2019t feel my legs.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know. The bullet hit your spinal cord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA bullet? I\u2019m paralyzed! Oh God, my legs!\u201d</p><p>Vincent sighed with annoyance. \u201cToughen up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Johnny struggled to move. \u201cMy fucking legs!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened is I got a call that someone was at my house, so I came home to investigate and found my son unconscious, his girlfriend missing, an innocent kid dead in my front yard, and you injured. You, at the scene of an attack on my family. So how about you tell me what happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI, uh, I don\u2019t know . . . I got shot, and I don\u2019t know how or who . . .\u201d</p><p>Vincent said, leaning against the table and crossing his arms over his chest. \u201cI understand how this life is. We get drawn into things that get out of control, but it\u2019s not too late to fix it. I need you to tell me what Nunzio wants with the girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>Vincent could sense his panic and fought to keep his expression calm so as not to alarm him further. \u201cYou have to be in pain, and you need your wound cleaned before infection takes hold. It\u2019s your only option.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell you anything,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lying,\u201d Vincent said. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t go along with something unless you knew why. Where did he take her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to believe me, Vincent. I can\u2019t tell you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can tell me, you just won\u2019t! There\u2019s a difference, and that difference is as vast as life and death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease!\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cDon\u2019t beg! It\u2019s unbecoming of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to understand\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you have to understand. They\u2019ve taken something important from me, and I\u2019m not going to stop until I find her. If you want even the slightest chance of making it out of this room alive, you\u2019ll tell me what I need to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I tell you anything, they\u2019ll kill me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t tell me, I\u2019ll kill you,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I won\u2019t take mercy on you. Every minute she\u2019s out there, you\u2019re going to be right here, and I\u2019m not going to end your suffering until she\u2019s back where she belongs.\u201d</p><p>The tension was so thick you could cut it with a knife. Carmine had heard the phrase so many times, but it wasn\u2019t until that moment, sitting in that immaculately clean car and fighting back nausea at the stench of fresh leather, that he finally understood what it meant. It was stifling, the hostility rolling from the man beside him too much to take.</p><p>Carmine had a fractured rib, a broken nose, and a mildly sprained wrist on top of the concussion. Vincent had called in a favor, and one of his colleagues agreed to see him off the record. Despite Carmine\u2019s insistence he didn\u2019t need any doctors, Vincent demanded he go, and when Vincent DeMarco demanded something, even Carmine couldn\u2019t say no. So when Corrado arrived in town, the two of them had set out for a clinic while his father stayed back to deal with the devastation.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not gonna kill that doctor I saw, are you?\u201d Carmine asked, the heavy dose of morphine in his system clouding his thoughts.</p><p>Corrado said nothing, and Carmine wasn\u2019t sure whether that was good or bad.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you should,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s just a doctor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarmine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d</p><p>Carmine decided then he should probably shut up.</p><p>Disoriented, he glanced at the clock on the dashboard and saw it was midnight. Haven had been gone for twelve hours, and the clock kept ticking as if the seconds didn\u2019t matter.</p><p>He sighed, the strain in the car growing.</p><p>Carmine felt like he could breathe again when they reached the house and put some space between them. He headed inside and paused in the foyer as his father stepped out of the room under the stairs. Corrado shuffled in and closed the front door. \u201cHas he talked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Vincent said. \u201cHe\u2019s given me nothing.\u201d</p><p>Corrado brushed past Carmine, giving Vincent a peculiar look before disappearing into the room. Vincent muttered something under his breath, refusing to look at Carmine as he strode away. Carmine sat down on the steps, putting his head down and rocking back and forth for a while, before pacing the hallway. As the morphine faded from his system, so did his patience.</p><p>Eventually, he heard footsteps on the stairs as Vincent approached at the same time Corrado stepped out, both men stopping in the foyer. Carmine looked between them, his last bit of control slipping. \u201cWhy are you just standing there? Can\u2019t you do something? Anything? Christ!\u201d</p><p>Before the last word was verbalized, Carmine was jerked by the back of his collar and slammed into the wall. He lost his breath as Corrado shoved a gun to his fractured rib. \u201cHave you still not learned your lesson? Is one of us going to have to die before you realize this isn\u2019t a game? These are our lives you\u2019re messing with, and I, for one, will not tolerate you endangering me more than you already have! I don\u2019t care whose child you are.\u201d</p><p>Carmine\u2019s heart pounded rapidly. He didn\u2019t doubt for a second that his uncle would shoot him.</p><p>\u201cCorrado,\u201d Vincent said. \u201cLet him go.\u201d</p><p>Corrado released Carmine and swung around, turning the weapon on Vincent. Carmine inhaled sharply as he watched it play out. Vincent stood as still as a statue, not blinking as he stared down the barrel of Corrado\u2019s gun.</p><p>\u201cYou keep pulling me in deeper and deeper, Vincent,\u201d Corrado said, lowering his pistol.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Vincent said.</p><p>Corrado turned to Carmine. \u201cThat mouth of yours is going to get every single one of us killed. If you can\u2019t close it yourself, I\u2019ll close it for you.\u201d</p><p>The next day dawned when Carmine made his way up to the third floor, his chest constricting as he pushed open his bedroom door. He sat on the edge of the bed and grabbed a pillow, clutching it to his chest as tears formed in his eyes.</p><p>Every bit of composure he had was ripped away as he inhaled Haven\u2019s scent, which lingered there. The grief swallowed him, refusing to let go until his father interrupted in the middle of the afternoon. \u201cWe\u2019re leaving for Chicago soon,\u201d Vincent said.</p><p>Carmine set the pillow down and wiped his tears, cringing at his torn, blood-splattered clothes. \u201cI should change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI prefer you stay here in case she shows back up.\u201d</p><p>Carmine laughed bitterly as he stood. \u201cShe\u2019s not a lost dog. She didn\u2019t wander out of the backyard and get lost in the woods somewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand, but you should reconsider. It\u2019s dangerous and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going,\u201d Carmine said, cutting him off. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want me to go with you, I won\u2019t, but I\u2019ll be on the next goddamn plane whether you like it or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, but you need to watch yourself, son. You can\u2019t run off on a vigilante mission. I can\u2019t focus on getting her back if you\u2019re out there wreaking havoc and counteracting everything I\u2019m doing.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI know. I\u2019ll keep my mouth shut and let you do what you do. I\u2019m not fucking na\u00efve. I know what might be happening to her, but I need to be there, no matter what.\u201d</p><p>Vincent pinched the bridge of his nose. \u201cFine. We\u2019ll tie up some loose ends then leave.\u201d</p><p>Carmine gazed at him. \u201cLoose ends? Is it, uh . . . you know, that guy, and . . .\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t finish his thought, but he didn\u2019t have to. Vincent understood. \u201cWe have Johnny in the basement. He hasn\u2019t said much, but I injected him with sodium thiopental a few minutes ago.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSodium what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSodium thiopental. It\u2019s a barbiturate. It suppresses the higher cortical functions of the brain, and since lying is such a complex process and it\u2019s easier to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnglish, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruth serum,\u201d Vincent said. \u201cHypothetically, anyway.\u201d</p><p>Carmine nodded. \u201cAnd Nicholas?\u201d</p> <p>Vincent stared at him, the look on his face the only answer Carmine needed. Even across the room, he could see the sorrow. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t anything I could do.\u201d</p><p>Dawn broke as Vincent stood in the safe room, once again interrogating a suffering Johnny. \u201cTell me where she is and this will end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d he said for what had to be the hundredth time, even proclaiming ignorance with the truth serum coursing through his veins.</p><p>Corrado approached, his dark eyes filled with rage. It wasn\u2019t something Vincent saw often. It was a look that said someone was about to die.</p><p>Violently.</p><p>Vincent stepped out of the way as Corrado strode over to the cabinet along the wall. He rifled through it, pulling out knives and pliers, methodically laying the tools on the steel worktable in the safe room. \u201cWhile you\u2019re still alive, we\u2019re going to play a game of eeny, meeny, miny, moe.\u201d</p> <p>Unable to stomach what was about to happen, Vincent walked away. A loud scream of agony echoed through the basement before he made it to the steps.</p><p>Johnny would be leaving the room soon . . . in pieces.</p><p>Corrado resurfaced an hour later, drenched from the rain outside and splattered with blood. His face was unreadable once more. \u201cRussians.\u201d</p><p>The lone word nearly stopped Vincent\u2019s heart. \u201cShe\u2019s with the Russians? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause she\u2019s one of ours. Isn\u2019t that reason enough?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey may have known before we did,\u201d Corrado said. \u201cThis is spiraling out of control. Up until now, you\u2019ve taken a backseat, but that can\u2019t happen anymore. This isn\u2019t going away.\u201d</p><p>Vincent knew that, even if he didn\u2019t want to admit it. \u201cWhere are the Russians keeping her?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJoey didn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Vincent\u2019s brow furrowed. \u201cI thought his name was Johnny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoey, Johnny . . . what\u2019s the difference?\u201d Corrado started walking away. \u201cI took care of the body. You can clean up the mess.\u201d</p><p>Vincent headed back down to the basement, cautiously making his way to the safe room. The concrete floor was soaked in red, splatters of it on the ceiling. He wasn\u2019t sure how Corrado managed to do that, but he didn\u2019t plan to ask.</p><p>He\u2019d learned long ago never to ask for details.</p><p>The rain outside was so heavy Carmine couldn\u2019t see the tree line a few hundred yards away. He gazed out the family room window in such a trance that he didn\u2019t hear footsteps approaching. He caught a glimpse of Corrado\u2019s reflection in the glass and grabbed his chest, wincing as he turned around. \u201cYou scared me.\u201d</p><p>Corrado unbuttoned his soiled shirt. \u201cYou aren\u2019t very observant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just stealthy, like a fucking ninja.\u201d</p><p>Ninja. The moment he said it, he felt like he had been slapped. Tears tried to force their way from his eyes, but he held them back in front of his uncle.</p><p>\u201cYou watch too much television,\u201d Corrado said. \u201cThe mark of a successful assassin is the target never knowing what hit him.\u201d</p><p>Carmine stared at him. \u201cI\u2019m not a target, though . . . at least I hope not.\u201d</p><p>The corner of Corrado\u2019s lips tugged into a small smile as he lit the fireplace. After the fire waged, he tossed his shirt into it and watched it burn. \u201cI remember when you and your mother went missing. A few of us were at your house, and you were late. Vincent sent a car, but it came back empty. Driver said you were already gone. Despite your father\u2019s fear that night, he did what he had to do. He learned to wear that calm mask well, but I knew him better than most.\u201d</p><p>He poked around in the fire, the shirt already burned to ash. \u201cYou and him are cut from the same mold\u2014too emotional, too invested in life on the outside, and that can be dangerous. People will exploit it for an upper hand, and both of you share a weakness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>Corrado looked at him like it was a stupid question. \u201cYour women, Carmine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t everyone have that problem, though?\u201d</p><p>Corrado shook his head. \u201cMost are incapable of loving anyone. Their wives are like their cars and their houses. They feel like they\u2019ve earned them, they take care of them, they show them off, but if push comes to shove, they\u2019d sell them out to save themselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that how you feel?\u201d Carmine asked. \u201cI always thought, you know, you and Celia . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do love Celia,\u201d Corrado said. \u201cThe difference is I can\u2019t be manipulated. They used Maura to force your father to do their business, just as Haven will be used to get you to do what they want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think that\u2019s why they kept me alive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure of it. We\u2019re all pawns, Carmine, and if you aren\u2019t careful, you\u2019ll play into their hands. Exposure isn\u2019t good in our world. I hope, since you\u2019re so much like Vincent, you\u2019ll learn to put on that mask. I already helped him bury Maura. I don\u2019t want to go through that again.\u201d He turned to walk away. \u201cAnd pack a bag, for God\u2019s sake. It looks suspicious to get on a plane with no luggage.\u201d</p><p>They landed in Chicago close to dusk that evening and made the twenty-five-minute journey from the airport to the Morettis\u2019 house in silence. Carmine watched out the window in a daze. He hadn\u2019t been back in years, but the neighborhood looked exactly like he recalled. They passed Tarullo\u2019s Pizzeria and Carmine closed his eyes, unable to look as they neared the alley where his life changed.</p><p>Corrado pulled into the driveway of the large brick house. A frazzled Celia stood in the doorway, and Corrado barely gave her a glance as he passed. She offered Vincent a sympathetic smile, and Carmine tried to slip by her, but she grabbed him for a hug.</p><p>He pulled away from her. \u201cThis is my fault.\u201d</p><p>Shaking her head, Celia cupped his chin. \u201cYou didn\u2019t cause this, kiddo. You would never do anything to hurt her. She\u2019s one of us . . . she\u2019s family. We\u2019ll find her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you\u2019re right,\u201d he said, dropping his bag right inside the house. He headed for the front room, catching sight of his brother on the couch. Dominic had his head down, his hands covering his face. Tess sat beside him and glanced at Carmine, her eyes widening. She nudged Dominic. \u201cDom.\u201d</p><p>Dominic\u2019s head popped up, his mouth agape. \u201cLook at you, bro.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt looks worse than it is,\u201d he lied, sitting on the other side of him. The pain was unbearable, both inside and out. \u201cShe\u2019s all that matters right now.\u201d</p><p>Neither said anything more before Vincent walked in, setting up his laptop on the coffee table. He looked at Dominic, his voice stern. \u201cI need you to locate her chip for me.\u201d</p><p>Carmine blanched. \u201cYou can\u2019t find it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t connect.\u201d</p><p>When he left, a tense silence lingered in his wake. Tess sighed loudly as she paced the room, picking up things to keep busy as Dominic turned to the laptop. His fingers flew furiously across the keys as he typed in code, none of it making any sense to Carmine.</p><p>The clicking keys grated on Carmine\u2019s raw nerves. He was nearing forty hours without sleep. His head felt too heavy for his neck, his red-rimmed eyes burning from exhaustion. Running his hand through his hair, he clutched it tightly as he swayed in his seat. The ticking of a clock in the background blended with Dominic\u2019s typing, taunting Carmine. Every tick was one second longer without her, one more second of uncertainty. Tess continued to pace, her heels clacking against the wood floor. It was too much for him to take.</p><p>Pace, click, tick. Pace, click, tick. Pace, click, tick.</p><p>Carmine was losing his fucking mind.</p><p>Celia walked in with some sandwiches and set a plate in front of him. \u201cYou should eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think she\u2019s eating?\u201d His voice cracked as the question came out. Was she eating? Were they taking care of her? Was she warm? Christ, where the fuck was she? He let out a shaky breath as his fear skyrocketed. Was she even alive?</p><p>Celia rubbed his back but he pulled away from her as Tess huffed again. \u201cDo you have something you wanna say, Tess?\u201d Carmine asked, standing. \u201cSomething you wanna get off your chest? Miss Goddamn Perfect always knows better than everyone. You never liked Haven, anyway. You\u2019re probably glad she\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>Tess gasped and covered her mouth as Dominic jumped up. He looked like he wanted to punch him, and for a moment, Carmine wished his brother would.</p><p>\u201cI think you need some sleep,\u201d Dominic said. \u201cHaven\u2019s like my sister. I\u2019m upset, too, so don\u2019t act like you\u2019re the only one who cares.\u201d</p><p>Carmine tried to get himself under control. \u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you weren\u2019t.\u201d Dominic sat back down, focusing his attention on the laptop. \u201cAnd if you think you can help in your condition, you\u2019re wrong. So eat your sandwich and go close your damn eyes.\u201d</p><p>The nondescript cinder block building stood in the middle of an abandoned neighborhood. Rust coated the black metal door, elaborate graffiti sprayed indiscriminately on the outside. Inside, the building was just as neglected, the concrete floor cracked and the walls covered in grime. It was still wired for electricity, overhead lights flickering. A metal exhaust fan near the ceiling continuously ran.</p><p>In the center of the room was a large card table, surrounded by men in collapsible chairs. Thousands of dollars lay on the table, empty beer bottles scattered around as each man held a set of cards. They spoke animatedly, arguing and laughing as their game of poker wore on into the night.</p><p>They seemed oblivious to the girl in the shadows of the far corner, curled up on a torn, stained mattress. Haven was equally as oblivious to them, her breathing shallow. Noises occasionally filtered into her blackness, muffled, incoherent words spoken in unrecognizable voices.</p><p>Little by little, she came back around, and with the consciousness came pain. The voices grew louder when she tried to sit up, her head swimming from disorientation. Panic flooded her system when the door banged in the distance. A woman entered and started toward the others, but stopped as she looked in Haven\u2019s direction. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me the girl was awake?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She had a tinge of a foreign accent that struck Haven as familiar, flashes of the accident coming back to her. It reminded her of the man who had held a gun to her head.</p><p>Everyone stopped speaking, shifting their focus to Haven. A pair of familiar eyes met hers, the sight of them making her stomach twist. Nunzio smirked before turning back to his cards, the rest of the men grumbling as they did the same.</p><p>The woman grabbed a bottle from a large cooler by the table and poured some of the liquid into a plastic cup before making her way across the room. Haven could make out her features as she approached, her long, stringy hair so blonde it was nearly white, the roots the color of midnight. Her blue eyes were large, her face round and full. She looked like an antique porcelain doll.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised to see you moving around,\u201d she said, her voice gentle as she held out the cup. Haven resisted, and the woman laughed lightly. \u201cIt\u2019s water, pretty girl. Drink.\u201d</p> <p>A part of Haven screamed not to trust her, but there was a bigger part desperate to accept the drink. She gave in after a moment, the cold liquid soothing her burning chest.</p><p>\u201cI thought he put you out for good,\u201d she said. \u201cI told Nunzy that last dose was too much. I don\u2019t know why he never listens to me.\u201d</p><p>The woman scoured through her purse and pulled out a pack of saltine crackers. \u201cYou\u2019re going to want to eat these. There\u2019s no telling when you\u2019ll have another chance.\u201d</p><p>Although she didn\u2019t trust her, Haven didn\u2019t want her stubbornness to ruin a chance to get some strength. Her stomach hurt with familiar pangs of hunger, so she took the crackers and ate them.</p><p>Her eyelids grew heavy. She fought the sleepiness, but it took control of her. She was light-headed and had to lie down as the woman smiled.</p> <p>\u201cSorry,\u201d she said, her voice a fading whisper, \u201cbut Nunzy won\u2019t bother you if you\u2019re asleep.\u201d</p><p>Haven realized, as the pain lifted and the sounds grew muffled, that she\u2019d been drugged again.</p><p>47</p><p>Carmine groggily glanced around the spare bedroom, his eyes falling on a clock across the room. It took a second for the numbers to register, and he sat up when he realized it was already eight in the morning. Pain surged through every inch of him as he climbed to his feet and descended the stairs. He paused in the doorway of the living room, seeing Dominic still typing away at the laptop as Tess paced. Everything appeared how he had left it.</p><p>Nearly half a day had passed, but nothing had changed.</p><p>Celia stepped out of the kitchen at the sound of his footsteps, appearing as exhausted as everyone else. \u201cHow are you feeling, kiddo?\u201d</p> <p>How did she think he felt? He hurt, inside and out. His entire life was chaos. Was he supposed to tell her he felt like dying would be relief? Would that make her feel better?</p><p>\u201cI feel fucking useless,\u201d he said, running his hand through his hair. \u201cIt\u2019s like I\u2019m just waiting for the other shoe to drop, and I hate that goddamn feeling.\u201d</p><p>Celia opened her mouth to respond, but chaos erupted before she could get out a single word.</p><p>Dominic jumped to his feet. \u201cIt\u2019s connecting!\u201d</p><p>Carmine\u2019s heart pounded rapidly as a door down the hall flung open and slammed against a wall. Carmine figured they had heard Dominic, but all hope disappeared when he made eye contact with his uncle. Corrado stared right past him at the door, his tanned skin seemingly void of all color.</p><p>Carmine\u2019s blood ran cold. Something was terribly wrong, but never in his wildest dreams could he have predicted what happened next.</p><p>\u201cFBI! Search warrant! Get on the ground! Now!\u201d</p><p>The shouting rang out from outside, multiple voices yelling at once. Carmine turned in disbelief as something slammed against the door, forcing it open. He flinched as the same noise echoed on the other side of the house, the back door torn from the hinges. Instinctively, he covered his head as a series of loud bangs ricocheted through the downstairs, bright lights blinding him as the police flash bombed the house.</p> <p>An influx of men in SWAT gear burst through the doors, screaming for them to get down. Tess cried out from the living room as Dominic cursed, their voices muffled to Carmine\u2019s ringing ears. It happened fast, and Carmine was cemented in place as Celia dropped to the floor with her hands above her head.</p><p>\u201cGet down!\u201d an officer screamed, pointing his weapon at Carmine, but he couldn\u2019t move. He couldn\u2019t do anything. Celia grabbed his foot and yanked it, sending him stumbling. He dropped to his knees, and the officer shoved his face into the floor. They forced his arms behind him, and he cried out, trying to pull his hands away when they grabbed handcuffs.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t resist,\u201d Celia said. \u201cThey need to detain us for their safety.\u201d</p><p>He relaxed his arms to let them secure the cuffs. The officer nearly cut off his circulation as he tightened them.</p><p>\u201cVincenzo Roman DeMarco, you\u2019re under arrest for violation of the RICO Acts, Title 18 of the United States Code, Section 1961,\u201d an officer declared as he walked down the hallway, leading Vincent to the front door. \u201cYou have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to have an attorney present during questioning. If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be appointed for you.\u201d</p><p>Carmine grew frantic as they neared. \u201cDad!\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep your mouth shut, Carmine,\u201d he said as they led him outside. Officers pulled Corrado off the floor next and read him the same rights, placing him under arrest too.</p><p>\u201cCall the lawyers, Celia,\u201d Corrado said calmly. \u201cI don\u2019t want them seizing anything without one present.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d she said, her voice shaking a bit. \u201cStay strong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about me,\u201d Corrado said. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>An officer helped Celia off the ground and searched her before they walked away, and others led both Dominic and Tess out of the living room. They pulled Carmine to his feet last and pushed him against the wall, vehemently patting him down and taking everything out of his pockets.</p><p>Once they were satisfied he had no weapons, they led him through the front door. The street was blocked off and covered in police vehicles, dozens of FBI agents and local officers swarming the area. Carmine watched as they put his father and uncle in separate unmarked dark SUVs, his footsteps faltering as the reality of it hit him.</p><p>\u201cWalk,\u201d the officer said, pushing him.</p><p>Carmine stumbled a few steps and winced as they shoved him down on the curb beside Celia. \u201cTake it fucking easy, man! I\u2019m hurt!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you need a medic, son?\u201d an older man asked, stepping in their direction. Carmine narrowed his eyes, reading Special Agent U.S. D.O.J. written on his vest in bright yellow letters.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not your son,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd what I need is to get the fuck out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPatience would be nice. I\u2019m Special Agent Donald Cerone, head of the organized crime division.\u201d</p><p>Carmine cocked an eyebrow at his Italian name. \u201cCerone? Must be new slang for traitor.\u201d</p><p>The agent snickered, motioning for the other officer to give him Carmine\u2019s belongings. Carmine sighed when the agent opened his wallet, knowing what he would find.</p><p>\u201cAh, what\u2019s this?\u201d he asked. \u201cCarmine Marcello DeMarco. Tell me, son, what year were you born? We have two different IDs here with two different ages.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVaffanculo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarmine,\u201d Celia warned. \u201cStop goading him.\u201d</p><p>Agent Cerone just laughed again.</p><p>A female agent released Celia from her handcuffs and handed her a cell phone to call a lawyer. They gave her paperwork, explaining what they were doing as officers released Dominic and Tess from their restraints. Carmine watched as calmly as he could, but his patience was severely thin.</p><p>\u201cAre you gonna take mine off?\u201d he asked. \u201cThis is bullshit, Cerone.\u201d</p><p>Agent Cerone ignored Carmine\u2019s request and instead tried to ask him questions, which Carmine in turn ignored, refusing to say a word. He ached and shifted position, but every time he did a dozen agents eyed him like he was going to run.</p><p>He would. He would run if he could get away.</p><p>They brought boxes and bags out of the house, all of them tagged with evidence tape. Carmine leaned back on his elbows and stared at the ground until someone yanked him to his feet. \u201cShould I release him now, boss? We\u2019re nearly done.\u201d</p><p>Agent Cerone shook his head. \u201cTake him downtown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d Carmine asked. \u201cI didn\u2019t fucking do anything!\u201d</p><p>The smirk returned to the agent\u2019s lips. \u201cIt\u2019s been a pleasure, Carmine Marcello DeMarco. I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll see more of each other in the future.\u201d</p><p>When Haven regained consciousness for the second time, sunlight streamed through the cracks around the exhaust fan. She tried to block out the pain as she looked around, her eyes meeting the same woman from before. \u201cGood morning, pretty girl.\u201d</p><p>Once again, everyone stopped talking and turned to her. Haven\u2019s heart rate accelerated when she spotted Nunzio. In the daylight she could see he had a bandage on his cheek.</p><p>\u201cAh, Sleeping Beauty is awake?\u201d a man asked as he stood from one of the chairs. He was tall with thick muscles, his face rigid as if chiseled from stone. His hair was mainly gray and his nose too large for his face. He, too, had an accent.</p><p>Nunzio laughed. \u201cDidn\u2019t even take a kiss from her prince to do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you feel?\u201d the man asked, ignoring Nunzio\u2019s comment. He dragged a chair across the room and sat down in front of Haven. Up close, she could see wrinkles covering his face. \u201cCan you speak, Princzessa?\u201d</p><p>Her brow furrowed at the word.</p><p>\u201cAh, confused? You are more comfortable with the Italians. Nunzy, boy, what word am I looking for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrincipessa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, do you know that one?\u201d He raised his eyebrows, expecting some response. Haven nodded and cringed from the pain in her neck. \u201cAre you hurting? You may speak. We are friends here.\u201d</p><p>She gave him an incredulous look, and the woman laughed. \u201cI don\u2019t think she believes you, Papa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it appears,\u201d he said, gazing at her curiously. \u201cI cannot say I blame you. You should not trust people, especially the ones you associate with, but I will never deceive you as they have.\u201d</p><p>Haven\u2019s voice was scratchy. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, she speaks!\u201d His hard expression gave way to excitement. \u201cWhat I am talking about is that your Italians have not been honest with you, nor have they treated you fairly, Principessa.\u201d</p><p>He confused her. \u201cWhy do you keep calling me that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you rather I call you by your slave name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI, uh . . .\u201d Did she? \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cI cannot believe you do not know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you,\u201d Nunzio said. \u201cShe\u2019s clueless.\u201d</p><p>The man leaned toward her, his hands clasped together in front of him. Haven tried to move away, her back pressed into the corner, his proximity nerve-racking. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou are probably wondering what you are doing here,\u201d he said, his tone serious. \u201cI will level with you\u2014I do not wish to hurt you, but I will if you make me, so I am asking for cooperation. I know you have fight in you, considering you have twice scarred my son.\u201d</p><p>She gaped at him as he motioned toward Nunzio. Son?</p><p>\u201cI should explain,\u201d he said. \u201cI am Ivan Volkov, and I have been acquainted with the DeMarcos for many years. Vincent was a child the first time we met. He was a pretentious prick, much like I hear his youngest is.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, as did Nunzio, and Haven felt tears forming at the mention of Carmine.</p> <p>\u201cDid I strike a nerve, Principessa?\u201d he asked. \u201cI hear you care for the boy. It would be a pity if something happened to him, so let us hope it does not come to that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d she whispered. \u201cPlease don\u2019t . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not wish to hurt him. If it helps, I have not heard of his death, so he is probably fine.\u201d</p><p>His voice taunted her. She tried to fight back tears, but it was too much to take.</p><p>\u201cAw, do not cry.\u201d He reached toward her but she recoiled. He dropped his hand without touching her. \u201cWhere was I?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou were talking about how much of a prick Vincent was,\u201d Nunzio said.</p><p>\u201cAh, yes. This was before he met his wife, of course. Shame what happened to her. I suppose I should feel guilty, but it was her fault.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cMeddling bitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou? You did it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can say I conducted that beautiful symphony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d Haven said. \u201cWhat do I have to do with any of this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have the power to bring down the enemy, and that is what you are going to do.\u201d</p> <p>She tensed, Carmine\u2019s words from weeks before hitting her again. I was born with enemies. My last name alone gives me more than I could ever earn.</p><p>\u201cI have laid the groundwork around Chicago, taking over businesses,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe have wiped out the competition, except for the Italians. People are loyal to them, and they have proven to be strong. I do not like being told where I can go and what I can do. I have found little ways in and turned a few, but I need something bigger, someone higher up. I need to crack the leadership, and Nunzy created a rift. They have held themselves together, but it is different now. Now I have you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe? But I\u2019m just . . . I\u2019m no one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you are definitely someone,\u201d he insisted. \u201cYou are my golden ticket. If I kidnapped the DeMarco boy, the Italians would come with guns blazing, but you are trickier. Salvatore will be happy to have you gone, the complication removed, but the others will not give up. There is nothing I enjoy more than seeing them fight. And when the DeMarco boy demands action, someone will spill the truth about who you are, thinking it will make Salvatore want to help.\u201d</p><p>Ivan laughed long and hard, as if that were the funniest thing he had ever heard.</p><p>\u201cWho am I?\u201d She immediately regretted the question, but it was too late to take it back.</p><p>\u201cI have been trying to tell you. You are the buried treasure, the one Salvatore thought would never be found, but I have dug you up.\u201d He reached out, his calloused finger drawing an X on her forehead. \u201cWhen the dust settles and they have killed one another, everything will be mine for the taking . . . including you.\u201d</p><p>He stood and turned to the blond-haired woman. \u201cGet her some water and something to eat, Natalia. Let her rest. You and your brother are on watch tonight.\u201d</p> <p>Haven sat as still as possible, her eyes vigilantly darting around the room as everyone filtered out, leaving her and Nunzio alone. He strolled to her and knelt down, placing his hand on her knee.</p><p>She fought back a shudder as his hand roamed up her leg and came to rest on her thigh. He squeezed tightly, his fingers digging into her flesh, and she cringed as he pulled himself up. Leaning over, he paused with his mouth next to her ear. \u201cMiss me?\u201d</p><p>A chill shot down her spine when his tongue swirled around her earlobe. Panicking, she shoved him. He stumbled a few steps, and before he could react, she pulled her leg up and slammed it into his crotch. He hunched over as she jumped up, her vision blurring from the sudden movement. She sprinted for the metal door across the room, but barely made it halfway there when he grabbed her from behind.</p><p>\u201cI like it when you fight,\u201d Nunzio said breathlessly. She cried for help as he dragged her across the room, grabbing a roll of duct tape from the card table.</p><p>She shook her head at the sight of it. \u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>He smirked. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She tried to move past him, shoving him again, but he grabbed her wrist and yanked her back. Pain ripped up her shoulder with such intensity that everything went black. He threw her on the mattress and straddled her.</p><p>Her brittle fingernails caught on his skin as she grasped at his face, pulling his bandage off and ripping the stitches underneath. Blood gushed from the wound, running down her arm.</p><p>Raising his fist, Nunzio slammed it into her face. Stars danced before her eyes. He tore off a piece of duct tape to cover her mouth. After muffling her cries, he jerked her onto her stomach. Pain radiated through her body as he forced her arms behind her, binding her hands and ankles together. He wiped his cheek, bringing his hand up to eye the blood, before storming outside.</p><p>Natalia returned with a bag of food and sat down on the mattress beside her. She unbound her and gently pulled the duct tape from Haven\u2019s mouth, feeding her until Haven turned away. Sickness churned in her stomach as Natalia patted her head. \u201cYou should not anger him. It isn\u2019t smart.\u201d</p><p>Eventually, Haven passed out from exhaustion, only to awaken later to Ivan kneeling in front of her. \u201cI thought you were going to play nice, Principessa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI, uh, he was going to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not need excuses,\u201d he said. \u201cI need cooperation.\u201d</p><p>Before she could speak again, he jabbed her with a needle. \u201cIt will be easier this way.\u201d</p><p>The holding cells at Cook County Jail are overcrowded bullpens of chain-link fence, the sour, putrid smell inside strong enough to singe nose hair. Carmine sat in the corner of one with his head down, surrounded by dozens of murderers, druggies, and thieves. People bickered, scuffles breaking out between rival detainees. On edge, he tried to maintain his strength, but he was dangerously close to cracking.</p><p>It was after nightfall when they booked him into the system. He was taken to a small room where he sat across from a lady who asked a lot of questions he had no desire to answer. He humored her with the basics, like his name and date of birth, but when she asked how he felt or if he was suicidal, he remained silent.</p><p>The love of his life was missing and his ability to help was gone. Instead of being out there, searching, he was trapped in a room with this nosy bitch asking him if he felt angry. Of course he was angry. Wasn\u2019t he supposed to be?</p><p>They gave up and ordered him out, writing an identification number on his arm in permanent marker before fingerprinting him and taking mug shots. He stared at the number the whole time, feeling sick at the sight of it. They had stripped him of his name. He was now number 2006-0903201.</p><p>An intake officer photographed Carmine\u2019s tattoos as he continued to glare at the number. \u201cAre you affiliated with any gangs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure? LCN counts as a gang.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLCN?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, the Mafia?\u201d</p><p>Carmine cut his eyes to him. \u201cThere is no Mafia.\u201d</p><p>The officer wrote something in his file before sending Carmine to be strip searched. By the time he put on that orange jumpsuit for protective custody, he felt like he had been thoroughly fucked.</p><p>They took him to division nine, placing him in a small cell on the top tier. It was closed in and suffocating, no bars or windows to the outside. The green paint on the thick metal door flaked, words scratched into it. He had nothing but a light and a threadbare blanket, the mattress no thicker than egg crate foam.</p><p>Hours slipped by while Carmine lay there, staring at the ceiling. Inmates yelled around him, sirens going off as guards ran by the door. He barely slept, tossing and turning in agony all night.</p><p>The next morning they came by with a breakfast tray, but he refused to eat their food, demanding they get him a lawyer. The same thing happened with lunch\u2014he ignored their food, and they ignored his questions. He was infuriated by the time dinner rolled around, utterly exhausted and frantically pacing the cell. He heard someone walking up and expected another tray to be shoved inside but was surprised when two correctional officers unlocked his door.</p><p>\u201cYou have a visitor,\u201d one of them said, handcuffing and shackling him before leading him to a small holding room. A hefty balding man sat inside at a table, a briefcase open in front of him. He looked up when Carmine entered and motioned for him to sit. The corrections officer secured Carmine before leaving them alone.</p><p>\u201cMy name\u2019s Rocco Borza, attorney at law. Celia Moretti contacted me about you.\u201d He pulled out some paperwork, sliding it across the table to Carmine along with a pen. \u201cI need you to sign this, agreeing to let me handle your case, and anything you say is confidential.\u201d</p><p>Carmine scanned the papers and awkwardly signed the lines the best he could with his restraints, before sliding them back.</p><p>\u201cFirst of all, I need to know if you\u2019ve spoken to anyone,\u201d he said, slipping the papers into his briefcase. \u201cHave they attempted to interrogate you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cThey haven\u2019t even explained why I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey charged you with possessing a fraudulent government document,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a class-four felony but can easily be knocked down to a misdemeanor. You should\u2019ve been given a probable cause hearing within a few hours and been released on bail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why am I sitting in that damn cell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey can detain you for a reasonable amount of time,\u201d he said. \u201cBut truthfully? You\u2019re there because you\u2019re the son of Vincenzo Roman DeMarco, the nephew of Corrado Alphonse Moretti, and the godson of Salvatore Gerardo Capozzi. You don\u2019t get much more notorious than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fucked up,\u201d Carmine said. \u201cI have nothing to do with their business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuilty by association,\u201d he said. \u201cHaving you released is my number one priority right now. Lucky for you, it shouldn\u2019t be more than a few days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDays? I\u2019m supposed to stay in this place for days?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, yes. I\u2019ll request a hearing, but it\u2019ll take time to get in front of a judge.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Borza walked out as the corrections officer patted Carmine down before escorting him to his cell, where a tray of food awaited him. He conceded to hunger, grabbing the container of pudding and sitting on the lumpy bed.</p><p>The second day of Carmine\u2019s incarceration passed similar to the first. Sometime in the evening, an officer came by to tell him he had another visitor. Relief washed through him, as he figured Mr. Borza had news, but the familiar man waiting was clearly not his lawyer. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCarmine DeMarco,\u201d Special Agent Cerone said. \u201cHave a seat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have nothing to say to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t even know why I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>He laughed dryly. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. I have nothing to say.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFair enough. You know your rights and can go back to your cell.\u201d Carmine turned to leave when the agent sighed exaggeratedly. \u201cI just wanted to talk about a girl named Haven.\u201d</p><p>Carmine\u2019s heart pounded rapidly at the mention of her, the ache in his chest intensifying. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer name came up a few times during the investigation,\u201d he said. \u201cI tried locating her, but there\u2019s barely any evidence she exists. It\u2019s as if she\u2019s a ghost.\u201d</p><p>Carmine balked at the word. \u201cWhy are you asking me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figure if you help me, I can help you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t need your help,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing I can tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t tell me who she is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He desperately wished he fucking could.</p><p>\u201cStrange. We made a trip to your hometown yesterday, and the people there are under the impression she\u2019s your girlfriend. I even came across this while I was there.\u201d He reached into his briefcase for a piece of paper, and Carmine\u2019s knees went weak when he saw it was the picture Haven had drawn for him, her name neatly written in the corner. \u201cDoes that jog your memory?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is she?\u201d he asked. \u201cShe\u2019s not in Durante, and she wasn\u2019t with you in Chicago. One of the only other people this girl seems to talk to is a boy named Nicholas Barlow, who coincidentally is also missing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>Special Agent Cerone was undeterred. \u201cDid something happen to your girlfriend? You can tell me. I\u2019m here to help\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t here to help. You don\u2019t give a shit about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she run off with Nicholas?\u201d he asked. \u201cDid she choose him over you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she dead?\u201d</p><p>He recoiled from his statement. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Nicholas dead?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you accusing me of something?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cAs I said, I want to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing you can do for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf she\u2019s missing or has been hurt\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want my lawyer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Agent Cerone stuck the drawing back into his briefcase. \u201cYou know, the truth always prevails. At the end of the day, the truth is what sets you free.\u201d</p><p>48</p><p>Time drifted by in a haze, like curls of smoke obstructing Haven\u2019s surroundings. She would come to the surface to find food waiting, and she would eat what she could stomach before slipping back under. Jen appeared a few times with Nunzio to check her vitals but never spoke a word. In fact, people were always in and out of the building, but no one acknowledged her except for Natalia. She would bring her fresh clothes and offer words of encouragement, helping her up whenever she needed to use the bathroom.</p><p>Each day grew progressively worse. Haven\u2019s strength diminished as her body began to reject everything. She would vomit profusely whenever she tried to eat, her skin clammy and pale. A pounding in her head made it hard to focus, everything becoming a blur of nothingness.</p><p>It was about then that she started hallucinating, hearing voices and seeing faces she couldn\u2019t be sure were truly there. The nightmares were extreme, filled with flashbacks in an inconsistent loop. Dr. DeMarco haunted her with the piercing glare of hatred she had seen that day in his room. She could feel the gun pressed into her throat as she gasped for air. She screamed in the darkness, her chest vibrating with the high-pitched shrieks.</p><p>The moments of lucidity became few and far between. Unfamiliar people stood over her, having strange conversations that made little sense. Her monster even surfaced, his mangled face appearing as if it were melting away. He said nothing, just stared as the fire engulfed her from the inside out.</p><p>The Metropolitan Correctional Center, a three-sided triangular skyscraper in the middle of downtown Chicago, has no barbed wire or electric fence, no armed guards standing in towers along the edge of the property. With its flat surface and narrow vertical windows, the front of the building resembles an old punch card. It appears harmless, indiscriminate, but some of the most dangerous people in the world call the place home.</p><p>Vincent sat in a small cell on the twentieth floor, a few yards from where Corrado was housed. The window was frosted, obstructing Vincent\u2019s view of the outside, so all he had to look at were the drab gray walls surrounding him.</p><p>Every day was the same: three meals, frequent head counts, occasional sirens, and little conversation. The guards watched their every move, all calls and visits monitored so none of them could risk communicating.</p><p>He sat there early one day, right after morning roll call, when a few corrections officers approached. They placed him in restraints and led him to a room, where Agent Cerone waited at a small table.</p><p>\u201cVincenzo DeMarco,\u201d he said, motioning toward the chair across from him. \u201cHave a seat.\u201d</p><p>Vincent sat down, grateful to be out of that dreary cell. They tried to secure him to the table, but the agent stopped them. \u201cThat\u2019s unnecessary. We\u2019re both civilized human beings here.\u201d</p><p>The officers looked at him with disbelief but walked out, leaving Vincent unsecured. The agent folded his hands on the table. \u201cYou\u2019re probably wondering who\u2014\u201d</p><p>Vincent cut him off. \u201cDoctor.\u201d</p><p>Agent Cerone\u2019s smile faltered. \u201cDoctor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd unless you\u2019re my mother or my priest, don\u2019t call me Vincenzo. It\u2019s Dr. Vincent DeMarco.\u201d</p><p>The agent stared at him before nodding. \u201cRight. And I\u2019m Special Agent Donald Cerone with the Justice Department . . . head of organized crime.\u201d</p><p>Vincent sighed exasperatedly. \u201cI have nothing to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured that much. You wouldn\u2019t have made it as far as you have if you weren\u2019t cunning. But truthfully, I\u2019m not here about your case. I hoped we could discuss something I found.\u201d Reaching into his briefcase, Agent Cerone pulled out a black notebook. \u201cDo you recognize this?\u201d</p><p>Vincent didn\u2019t respond, having no intention of saying another word to the man.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take the lack of reaction as a no,\u201d he said. \u201cWe found this in a bedroom on the third floor of your residence.\u201d</p><p>He flipped it open, and Vincent saw the page was covered in barely legible juvenile scrawl. Realization hit him that it belonged to Haven. He tensed, concerned as to what information those pages might contain.</p><p>\u201cThe entire thing\u2019s engaging, but there were some passages I found particularly interesting. I thought I\u2019d share them with you.\u201d He stopped on a bookmarked page and scanned the lines of writing with his finger before reading a passage out loud.</p><p>Katrina sometimes said she would kill me in my sleep. She told me to keep one eye open if I wanted to live. I stayed awake those nights in case she meant it. I wasn\u2019t afraid to die, but I didn\u2019t want to leave Mama alone. I didn\u2019t want Master Michael to hurt her more, and I thought Katrina would kill her next.</p><p>The agent flipped to a different page and read another one.</p><p>I called Master Michael daddy once when he visited the ranch. I heard someone say that was what he was to me, but he got angry and beat me. Mama begged him not to kill me. He stopped because Frankie made him. Frankie hit Michael for it and I remember thinking we weren\u2019t the only people who got punished like that. I should\u2019ve been scared, but it made me feel like maybe Frankie didn\u2019t hate me. He hit his son, but he still loved him, right?</p><p>Agent Cerone glanced at him when he was finished. \u201cThe Antonellis? So unfortunate about their deaths.\u201d</p><p>Vincent sat still, not giving any indication he was panicking inside. Things were unraveling quickly.</p><p>\u201cHow about one more?\u201d Agent Cerone asked, flipping to another page. \u201cI think you\u2019ll personally find this one fascinating.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ll never forget the look in his eyes. I was only trying to do what he told me to do, because I didn\u2019t want to get in trouble for not listening. I thought he was going to kill me, but he did something worse. He left me alone in the dark. He was nice to me, and I didn\u2019t want to disappoint him. I dream about the look on his face when he turned into a monster. I wish I could forget. I wish Dr. DeMarco liked me.</p><p>Vincent kept his expression blank, but the words hit him hard. The agent closed the notebook, shaking his head. \u201cWhat did you do to the poor girl? Why don\u2019t you like her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReading that is an invasion of privacy,\u201d Vincent said. \u201cI know the law, and I\u2019m well aware of what you can confiscate during a search and seizure. A young girl\u2019s diary is off limits.\u201d</p><p>Special Agent Cerone slipped the notebook into his briefcase. \u201cLike I said, cunning. I\u2019d love to return it. Do you know where I can find her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to speak to my lawyer.\u201d</p><p>He pushed his chair back. \u201cI\u2019m sure you would, Vincenzo. It\u2019s nice to officially meet you after spending so many months monitoring you from afar. If you decide you want to talk after all, I think you can figure out how to get ahold of me.\u201d</p><p>The orange jumpsuit was particularly bright under the fluorescent lights of the busy courtroom. Carmine listened to his lawyer argue that there was no probable cause to keep him incarcerated. The judge seemed bored, and as soon as Mr. Borza stopped speaking, he ordered Carmine released and the charges dropped.</p><p>He walked out the doors of the jail, finding Celia waiting for him. \u201cThanks for springing me.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have been in there in the first place. Let\u2019s just hope Mr. Borza has as much luck with Vincent and Corrado.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are they? Fuck, where are they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re being detained downtown at MCC. They have hearings next week, though, and the lawyers are confident they can get them released.\u201d</p><p>Carmine shook his head. \u201cAnother week?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately.\u201d</p><p>A tense silence lingered in the car during the drive to the Morettis\u2019 house as that sunk in with Carmine. It wouldn\u2019t be easy, and he\u2019d have to take some big risks if he was going to save Haven. He always said he would sacrifice for her, and that was exactly what he would have to do.</p><p>Celia pulled up to the house, but Carmine remained in the car. She realized he wasn\u2019t moving. \u201cYou coming inside?\u201d</p><p>He could feel tears building up. \u201cI can\u2019t. I, uh . . . There\u2019s somewhere I have to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarmine . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019ve made mistakes, but I\u2019d never do anything to get any of you hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She handed him the car keys. \u201cJust be careful, kiddo.\u201d</p><p>Carmine drove straight to Lincoln Park, parking in front of the five-bedroom mansion that sat alone on a hill. He took a deep breath as he made his way onto the porch, his nerves on edge. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He pressed the doorbell, hearing the chimes inside the house. The door was opened swiftly. Standing in front of him was Teresa Capozzi. \u201cCarmine DeMarco? What a surprise! I thought you were locked up with the rest of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey released me.\u201d</p><p>She brought her glass of wine to her lips and gulped the contents. \u201cWell, then. I\u2019m sure Salvatore will be ecstatic to see you. He\u2019s upstairs with Carlo. Do you know him? Lovely man. Second door on the right.\u201d</p><p>Carmine brushed by her without replying and headed upstairs. He hesitated in front of the closed door, hearing arguing inside. He couldn\u2019t make out their words, but Sal sounded irate. Carmine briefly reconsidered, unsure of how he would do what he had come to do, but forced himself to knock. He had no time to waste.</p> <p>The bickering silenced immediately. The door was yanked open, an annoyed Salvatore appearing in the doorway. He froze, surprise flashing across his face. \u201cPrincipe! I thought you were my dreadful wife coming to nag me some more. Come in.\u201d</p><p>Carmine stepped past him into the vast room, seeing a man in a chair off to the side. The guy stood and turned toward him, and Carmine balked at his disfigured face. A strange sensation hit Carmine, a rush of bitter cold running from his head down to his toes.</p><p>Lovely man? He didn\u2019t fucking think so.</p><p>Carlo left without a word, and Salvatore shut the door. \u201cTo what do I owe the pleasure of your visit?\u201d he asked, sitting at his desk as Carmine slipped into an empty chair.</p><p>\u201cI think you know why I\u2019m here, so we can cut the bullshit.\u201d</p> <p>Salvatore\u2019s smile fell. \u201cYou always were a bold one. Most people wouldn\u2019t dare come to me like this, but you have guts. That kind of commitment is rare nowadays.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to find her,\u201d Carmine said. \u201cNo matter what.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI respect that.\u201d Salvatore pulled out a cigar, lighting it and taking a deep puff before continuing. \u201cI wish I could help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wish you could help? What does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means as unfortunate as this situation is, I have more pressing matters to deal with right now. My men are turning quicker than I can keep track of. I have people being arrested, their houses invaded and property seized. Every day it\u2019s something new. I can\u2019t take on anything else.\u201d</p><p>Carmine stared at him. \u201cBut this is my girlfriend. She\u2019s been kidnapped by your people, and you\u2019re telling me you can\u2019t help?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI assure you, if anyone wants to locate Squint, it\u2019s me,\u201d Sal said. \u201cI have people on the lookout for him, and when he\u2019s found he\u2019ll face the consequences. But I don\u2019t have the resources or the justification to focus on him when my entire organization is being attacked. I sympathize with you, Principe, because I\u2019ve lost loved ones, but Haven means nothing to me.\u201d</p><p>His words hit Carmine hard, the callous, nonchalant tone sending his temper flaring. \u201cShe\u2019s not nothing. She\u2019s fucking family!\u201d</p><p>Sal scoffed. \u201cHow did you come to that conclusion?\u201d</p><p>Carmine hesitated for a split second, but he needed to cover his tracks. \u201cI thought we were all family. You talk about loyalty and commitment, but where\u2019s yours? Am I nothing to you, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou chose not to be a part of my family,\u201d Salvatore said. \u201cI\u2019ll always have a soft spot for you, but you need to understand the organization, la famiglia, is my family. I respect your choice not to be involved, but it\u2019s all I have. Just as you\u2019ll sacrifice to save what matters to you, I\u2019ll do whatever it takes to save what matters to me. We have the same type of loyalty, just for different things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s what it\u2019s gonna take. You\u2019re gonna make me\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not making you do anything,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can walk out that door, and I wish you all the luck in the world, but if you\u2019re requesting my assistance\u2014if you\u2019re demanding my loyalty\u2014then it\u2019s only fair you give me yours in return. Without it, we have nothing.\u201d</p><p>Carmine\u2019s anger and heartbreak came together in that moment. It didn\u2019t take him long to respond, because deep down he already knew. Part of him knew it when he laid eyes on her that first day in the kitchen. \u201cYou got it,\u201d he said. \u201cWhatever it takes.\u201d</p><p>Salvatore stared at him. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s the only thing I\u2019ve ever been sure of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d Salvatore said, holding out his hand. Carmine hesitated before kissing the back of it obediently. \u201cI\u2019ll make a few calls and see what I can do for you, Principe.\u201d</p><p>Vivid dreams turned into hallucinations, memories morphing back into nightmares. It all ravaged Haven as if it were flames, melting everything into molten lava of pain. She held on, clinging to the surface and fighting to survive. But no matter what, the blackness took her deeper . . . and deeper . . . and deeper . . . until one afternoon, it swallowed her whole.</p><p>Haven was certain she was dead then, because in front of her, wearing a flowing white dress, stood an angel.</p><p>Maura took Haven\u2019s hand and helped her to her feet in the filthy abandoned warehouse. The two of them strolled away, the walls crumbling as they stepped into a vast field of flowers. Sunlight streamed upon them, and Haven realized it was the clearing in Durante.</p><p>\u201cCarmine brought me here,\u201d she said. \u201cI think he came here when he was sad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Maura said. \u201cI\u2019m always with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. I\u2019m his mother, and mothers never leave their children. We live in them, deep down in their hearts. Carmine can\u2019t see me, but I know he feels me all the time.\u201d</p><p>The thought comforted Haven. \u201cDo you think he\u2019s okay?\u201d</p><p>Maura smiled. \u201cI\u2019m sure he will be.\u201d</p><p>Haven wandered through the field and picked a dandelion puff, blowing on it. The fluffy seeds flew off and multiplied, exploding into hundreds surrounding her in the air.</p><p>\u201cIs my mama with me, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Maura said. \u201cDon\u2019t you feel her? She\u2019s right there.\u201d</p><p>Haven spun around so quick everything blurred. When it came back into focus, the dandelion seeds had morphed into snowflakes, falling from the sky like puffs of cotton. They coated everything in a layer of white, hindering her view of her mama a few feet away. She was twirling, the sound of her laughter encasing Haven in a blanket of love. For a moment, as she watched her mama dance, she forgot it wasn\u2019t real. She forgot her mama was dead. She forgot she must be, too.</p><p>But in a flash it all came back, as when she blinked, her mama started to fade.</p><p>Panicked, Haven ran toward her, but the snow came down heavier, blinding her with whiteness. Haven ran long and hard, her chest burning and legs weak, but she didn\u2019t seem to be getting anywhere. Exhausted, she collapsed to the ground in sobs, suddenly in Blackburn again. The desert ground burned her, scorching the soles of her feet.</p><p>After a moment, a voice rang out behind her, the smooth familiarity silencing her cries as goose bumps spread across her skin. \u201cShe\u2019s gone,\u201d Carmine said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, hummingbird, but she isn\u2019t coming back.\u201d</p><p>Haven turned, desperate to see him, but instead of deep green eyes, all she saw was icy blue. Haven\u2019s stomach twisted as Number 33 stared through her, the paper still pinned to her shirt. \u201cNever stop fighting,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re gone, too,\u201d Haven said. \u201cI saw it. Frankie killed you in front of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome things in life are worse than death,\u201d Number 33 said, \u201cand had I lived, those things would\u2019ve happened to me. He took my life, but he didn\u2019t break my spirit. No one did, and no one ever will. Don\u2019t let them break you. Don\u2019t let them win. Fight the fight. It\u2019s the only way to be free.\u201d</p><p>Haven was jolted roughly from behind then, everything going black. Someone shook her as pain swept through her body, and she forced her eyes open, seeing Ivan. His voice was muffled as if her ears were clogged. \u201cWhat is the code at the DeMarco house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she mouthed, no sound carrying out. It burned, stabbing her throat.</p><p>\u201cThe code for the house,\u201d he repeated. \u201cIf you do not want to die from dehydration, you will tell me what I want to know.\u201d</p><p>She turned her head, wishing he would disappear. \u201cGo away.\u201d</p><p>Her disobedience sent him into a rage. He pulled out a knife as he grabbed her hand, twisting it violently. \u201cTell me the code, or I\u2019ll cut off your finger.\u201d</p><p>Every inch of her begged for relief. She squeezed her eyes shut, Dr. DeMarco flashing in her mind again. She could see his anger, but she couldn\u2019t feel the fear anymore as he pressed the gun to her throat. She understood how he felt, and as she lay there in agony, she almost wished Dr. DeMarco really had pulled the trigger. \u201cDo it.\u201d</p><p>Night had fallen hours before, but Carmine no longer had any sense of time. He thought it was ten o\u2019clock, maybe midnight, but it was nothing but a number to him now. He would simply go until he felt like he couldn\u2019t go anymore, and then he would push himself just a little more. He had moved past exhaustion and now teetered on the brink of a nervous breakdown. Sleep only happened when his body gave out, periods of blackouts tucked into the frantic spells.</p><p>Carmine knew nothing about Giovanni, besides the fact that he was Sicilian and he broke the law. They had only met a handful of times, and Giovanni was never friendly, but Carmine had a newfound respect for the man. The two of them stood in the small office at Giovanni\u2019s modest brick house, poring over a map of Chicago. They had been at it for so long that Carmine couldn\u2019t read the small print anymore and counted on Giovanni to keep everything straight.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure it\u2019s this guy?\u201d Carmine asked, picking up the small photograph. \u201cHe looks like someone\u2019s grandfather.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am certain,\u201d Giovanni said. \u201cDo not be fooled. Ivan Volkov is dangerous.\u201d</p><p>Carmine stared at the photo, trying to focus. He remembered his father mentioning problems with the Russians months ago, but Carmine still didn\u2019t understand what any of it had to do with them. Giovanni had tried to explain it more than once, but the point was lost somewhere between the man\u2019s accent and Carmine\u2019s exhausted mind.</p><p>He set the picture down and glanced at the map. Giovanni was on his laptop researching addresses associated with the Volkov family. The map was littered with writing, random circles splattered on it like polka dots.</p><p>Carmine stared at it, overwhelmed.</p><p>\u201cI thought Doc microchipped the girl,\u201d Giovanni said. \u201cWhy have you not found her that way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe tried,\u201d Carmine said. \u201cThe chip isn\u2019t working.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what does that mean?\u201d</p><p>Carmine looked at Giovanni. \u201cMeans she\u2019s probably underwater or in a windowless room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we should circle Lake Michigan also?\u201d</p><p>Carmine felt like he had been punched at those words. \u201cI refuse to think that.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI would not believe it, either,\u201d Giovanni said. \u201cVolkov would not take her just to kill her. And in good news, we can cross out everywhere with a lot of windows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll still leave a dozen properties,\u201d Carmine said. \u201cHow do we know which one to go to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe start at the top,\u201d Giovanni said, pointing at a location in the north side of the city. \u201cWork our way down until we find her.\u201d</p><p>Sighing, Carmine ran his hands down his face in frustration. \u201cWhy are you helping me, anyway? Everyone else said it was a waste of time, that it was a suicide mission.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey do not understand.\u201d Giovanni\u2019s voice was quiet as he sat down near Carmine. \u201cI warned them the Russians would make a move, but they did not listen. The Russians invade our streets, and Sal does nothing. They harass our people, and Sal does nothing. They turn our people against us, and Sal does nothing. Now they kidnap a girl, and what does Sal do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Carmine said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t do a damn thing.\u201d</p><p>Giovanni nodded. \u201cIf somebody does not do something, they will kill our people next. I, for one, cannot sit back and allow them to.\u201d</p><p>The day of the hearing, Vincent\u2019s stress level was at an all-time high. The U.S. Marshals drove him and Corrado in separate cars to the Dirksen Federal Building a few blocks away. Their team of lawyers waited when they walked into the courtroom, taking seats at the defendants\u2019 table. Corrado appeared calm and confident in his black Armani suit, the complete opposite of how Vincent felt. While it was a relief to be out of the prison attire, his button-up shirt choked him.</p><p>The government seemed confident, their lackadaisical attitudes making Vincent more nervous. A prosecutor stood, casually fixing his tie as he addressed the court. \u201cYour Honor, we\u2019re talking about racketeering, gambling, extortion, fraud, and conspiracy to commit murder. Each defendant is facing thirty-five counts. Releasing them would be potentially unleashing more of this onto the community. The evidence clearly suggests neither man intends to stop.\u201d</p> <p>Their lawyers argued their cases when the government was done, citing Fourth Amendment violations and unreasonable searches. They said the evidence was flimsy at best\u2014no surveillance footage, no confessions, no DNA. The most they had were rumors and infamous names, and that wasn\u2019t enough to take a man away from his life. Rocco Borza went on a passionate tirade about how the RICO Acts were being used to railroad innocent individuals, and how much of an injustice it was that they weren\u2019t free. It took everything Vincent had not to laugh. He was guilty as charged, and the man beside him certainly was no saint.</p><p>The judge let out a long sigh when both sides were done. \u201cWhile the government makes a good point, the Fifth Amendment guarantees no one should be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. We\u2019re innocent until proven guilty in this country, and the defendants have yet to be convicted of any crimes. They can\u2019t be remanded without bail simply because you believe they may commit a crime in the future. Therefore, the defendants\u2019 petition for bail is granted. Fifty thousand dollars, cash bond.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour honor,\u201d the prosecutor said, standing. \u201cWe ask that the defendants surrender their passports, and that neither be allowed to leave the state.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Borza interjected right away. \u201cOne of my clients is a well-known doctor in North Carolina, where his permanent residence is located. Demanding he stay in Illinois isn\u2019t fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth defendants will surrender their passports,\u201d the judge ordered. \u201cIf Dr. DeMarco chooses to return home, he\u2019ll have to submit to electronic monitoring.\u201d</p><p>Celia gathered the bail money as the men were processed out of the system. It was later that evening when Vincent walked out the front doors of the jail to come face-to-face with his sister, leaning against the side of her car, her face lined with worry as if she had aged a decade over night.</p> <p>\u201cHey, little brother.\u201d She forced a smile. \u201cYou look like hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook who\u2019s talking,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re starting to look like Ma.\u201d</p><p>She laughed awkwardly. \u201cOuch, low blow. Speaking of Mom, you should call her. She\u2019s worried about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat woman hates me,\u201d Vincent said. \u201cShe\u2019s probably worried I\u2019ll publicly disgrace the DeMarco name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t hate you. She just has a strange way of showing her love. I had to talk her out of calling the Department of Corrections to ask if the foot of your bed faced the door, since it\u2019s bad luck. She was worried your soul would slip out while you slept.\u201d</p><p>Despite his stress, he managed to smile. \u201cMust be why I got lucky enough to be released today. The bed faced the other way.\u201d</p><p>Things grew tense as they drove toward Portage Park in silence. \u201cDid Corrado get released?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cHe went home an hour ago.\u201d</p> <p>Vincent turned to look out the window. He wanted to ask about Carmine, but it was an answer he wasn\u2019t ready to hear. It had been two weeks since the girl disappeared, and Vincent couldn\u2019t imagine what his son was going through.</p><p>When they reached the Moretti\u2019s house, Celia headed inside without waiting for him. He followed, his footsteps faltering when he heard her frantically whispering in Corrado\u2019s office.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t do it,\u201d she said. \u201cHow am I supposed to tell him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know him better than anyone,\u201d Corrado said. \u201cHe\u2019ll take it better coming from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter who it comes from\u2014he\u2019s going to flip out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat may be true, but someone needs to tell Vincent.\u201d</p><p>Vincent stepped into the doorway. \u201cTell me what?\u201d</p><p>Celia stammered. \u201cCarmine was worried. Or, he is worried. He couldn\u2019t just sit around. I suspected what he was going to do, but I couldn\u2019t forbid him. I didn\u2019t even know if I should. He\u2019s an adult, and it\u2019s not what she would want for him, and I knew you\u2019d be upset, but it\u2019s his life. And he was worried, Vincent. You were in jail, and he didn\u2019t know who else to turn to.\u201d</p><p>Her statements were disjointed, but the gist of them registered with him. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me he . . . No, there\u2019s no way he went to them after everything I did to make sure it didn\u2019t happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong! He\u2019s not that stupid, Celia!\u201d</p><p>Her eyes filled with tears. \u201cI\u2019m not wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you misunderstood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cGiovanni was here with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGiovanni? You have to be kidding. If he\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cVincent,\u201d Corrado said, his harsh voice cutting him off. \u201cYou know there are things we cannot and should not say as men of honor, and you\u2019re teetering dangerously close to saying something you\u2019ll later regret.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut this is Carmine we\u2019re talking about. This is my son!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and he\u2019s made his choice. He\u2019s in the life now, and nothing can change that fact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere has to be something! Carmine isn\u2019t cut out for this! He\u2019s throwing his life away and why, Corrado? For what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor her,\u201d he said, giving him an incredulous look. \u201cHow soon you forget. You were once that eighteen-year-old boy, turning to La Cosa Nostra to save the woman you loved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I didn\u2019t save her! She\u2019s dead, and if I would\u2019ve never gotten involved in this, she\u2019d\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019d what?\u201d Corrado asked, cutting him off again. \u201cShe\u2019d be alive? Even you can\u2019t believe that! She\u2019d still be dead today, but she would\u2019ve died a slave. You gave her a chance. Her life was cut short, but it wasn\u2019t you or La Cosa Nostra that did it. Maura sacrificed herself. You think your son is so much like you, but what you fail to realize is he\u2019s his mother, too. There\u2019s nothing na\u00efve about the decision he made.\u201d</p><p>Before he could respond, the phone in the office rang. Corrado grabbed the receiver off the desk in front of him. \u201cMoretti.\u201d He paused. \u201cYes, we\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p><p>Vincent sighed when he hung up. \u201cSalvatore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wants to see us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarmine\u2019s in too deep,\u201d Vincent said. \u201cHe has no idea what he\u2019s doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hope you\u2019re wrong.\u201d Corrado grabbed his keys. \u201cHow long until you need to report in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cForty-eight hours.\u201d Vincent had two days to self-surrender to be fitted with an ankle monitor. It wasn\u2019t house arrest, with a curfew or a base restricting him to a certain location, but a precaution to make sure he didn\u2019t try to disappear. It also meant they could keep a log of everywhere he went, which put him in a precarious situation within the organization.</p><p>\u201cI suppose that means we have forty-eight hours, then.\u201d</p><p>Corrado started for the door, but Celia stopped him. \u201cIt\u2019s good to have you home, so make sure you come back.\u201d</p><p>He brushed his hand across her cheek. \u201cI always do, don\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>Anger festered inside Vincent as they drove to Salvatore\u2019s house. They went straight to the den when they arrived, where Salvatore sat with a few members of the organization. The younger ones stood out of respect, but Vincent ignored them and took his usual seat.</p><p>He ignored the glass of scotch someone tried to hand him, too.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to see the two of you,\u201d Salvatore said. \u201cI know you\u2019re both honorable, though, so I\u2019m not worried about any future issues in this case.\u201d</p><p>Vincent stared at him. As usual, Salvatore\u2019s only concern was it coming back on him. He expected them to keep their mouths shut and accept whatever punishment, and the saddest part of all, Vincent thought, was they would do it. The Omert\u00e0 vow of silence swore just that.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, on to lighter business,\u201d Sal said. \u201cI assume you\u2019ve heard the good news by now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout Carmine?\u201d Vincent clenched his hands into fists in his lap. There was nothing light or good about it.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s great to have another generation of DeMarcos working with us. You\u2019ve raised a great son, a loyal man like you. You should be proud.\u201d</p><p>Vincent cleared his throat to force back the words he really wanted to say. \u201cWhere is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s with Giovanni,\u201d Salvatore said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been trying to track down that poor girl. Such a shame she hasn\u2019t been located.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave they gotten any information?\u201d</p><p>Salvatore\u2019s insensitive laughter cut through the room. \u201cVincent, you know I\u2019ve chosen to remain uninvolved. You\u2019d have to ask them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill? What did my son come to you for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarmine choosing this path is unrelated,\u201d he said, his lips still curved into a sinister smile. \u201cGiovanni volunteered for his little mission, and they have our resources at their disposal, of course, but it has nothing to do with me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow can you say that?

It\u2019s all of our problem!\u201d</p><p>The room fell into a tense silence, and everyone stared at Vincent, stunned. Corrado spoke before the strain could grow. \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, I think we should catch up with Carmine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, do that,\u201d Salvatore said. \u201cUse whatever you need.\u201d</p><p>Corrado stood. \u201cCome on.\u201d</p> <p>Vincent pushed his chair back and followed Corrado out of the room. Whispers started as he exited, but Salvatore demanded silence right away. Vincent shouldn\u2019t have reacted, but he was so disgusted he couldn\u2019t stop himself. Everything he had done had been in vain, a waste of time and energy, because Carmine ended up exactly where he had tried to keep him from going.</p><p>And the girl certainly hadn\u2019t been saved.</p><p>\u201cYou must want to die,\u201d Corrado said, walking through the house. \u201cSpeaking to him that way will get you killed.\u201d</p><p>Corrado opened a door to a back room and stepped inside. He opened cabinet doors and grabbed weapons, tossing Vincent two .45 Smith &amp; Wessons before pulling out two guns for himself, slipping them into his coat along with more ammunition.</p><p>Giovanni lived not far from Salvatore. The house was empty when Corrado and Vincent arrived, so Corrado slipped around the back and kicked in the door. The two of them headed straight to Giovanni\u2019s office and rifled through drawers and files, looking for anything they might have dug up.</p> <p>Corrado found a map of Chicago and unfolded it on the desk beside him. Areas of it were circled and crossed out, the entire thing riddled with writing. Vincent recognized some of it as his son\u2019s, the sloppy words scribbled with a frenzied hand.</p><p>\u201cThey have Ivan\u2019s properties pinpointed on the map, but there\u2019s no way they would\u2019ve taken Haven somewhere with his name on the deed,\u201d Corrado said. \u201cHe\u2019s smarter than that. He would\u2019ve found somewhere close to home but far enough away to keep the two separate. Somewhere remote where there\u2019s no chance of her being stumbled upon, but not so isolated that their traffic would draw curious eyes. Somewhere people mind their own business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would\u2019ve made a good detective,\u201d Vincent mused.</p><p>Corrado shot him an incredulous look. \u201cJust because I understand the mind of a criminal doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019d be a good cop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, maybe you\u2019re right,\u201d Vincent said, scrolling through the computer\u2019s history. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t last a day before you got an excessive force complaint.\u201d</p><p>Corrado stared at him in silence for a moment before turning to the map, and Vincent focused his attention on Giovanni\u2019s computer. Numerous addresses and names had been searched, but nothing stood out as important.</p> <p>Corrado pointed to a section of map circled with a pencil. \u201cWhat\u2019s on this side of Austin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing that I know of,\u201d Vincent said. \u201cBad neighborhood, a lot of gang activity. Most of the businesses moved out of the area, so there are a lot of vacant buildings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought,\u201d Corrado said. \u201cIt\u2019s a money pit, yet Natalia Volkov owns property there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIvan\u2019s daughter? Isn\u2019t she still a teenager?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe she just turned nineteen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds odd.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does,\u201d Corrado said. \u201cIt also sounds like a good place to start.\u201d</p><p>49</p> <p>The sun had set, darkness falling over Chicago as Vincent and Corrado drove to the west side of the city. A full moon hovered in the sky, a ring of light surrounding it partially shielded by a thin cloud covering. The wind whipped a bit, vibrating the car with its unpredictable gusts.</p><p>The lack of communication wore on Vincent\u2019s nerves. He had no idea what his son was up to, what situation he was in, or if he was okay. Giovanni had never given Vincent reason to distrust him, but the fact that it was his soldati that had gone awry didn\u2019t sit well with him. If he had been paying attention, he should have seen it.</p><p>Corrado turned off the highway and cruised through the streets. Most of the buildings appeared abandoned, worn down and boarded up. Gang signs were strewn around with spray paint by street thugs who considered themselves hardcore. Men with no true loyalty, no respect within their orders.</p><p>Their lack of civility had always disgusted Antonio. He loathed their usage of the word gangster, cringed at their definition of brotherhood. Vincent couldn\u2019t count how many times his father had ranted about it, priding himself on the fact that his organization had respect. They may have committed heinous crimes, but in his mind, all of it was founded. His father took the oath seriously and believed, until the day he died, that they were a true family, la famiglia, with a bond stronger than blood.</p><p>Vincent never thought he would see the day where he wished his father was still in control.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right, Vincent?\u201d Corrado asked. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford second thoughts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not having second thoughts,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m thinking about how disturbed my father would be about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of this would be happening if your father were around,\u201d Corrado said. \u201cHe was an honorable man, as far as honor goes within our world. Antonio\u2019s organization was united.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now we\u2019re no better than the guys tagging these buildings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t go that far. I think most of us still have our honor. What you\u2019ve done for Haven, after what she\u2019s cost you, is honorable. I can\u2019t say I\u2019d do the same if I were in your position. If it were my wife, I would\u2019ve killed the girl a long time ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI almost did,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead, you\u2019re risking your life to find her, and that\u2019s where the honor is, Vincent. Sometimes you have to look at the bigger picture.\u201d</p><p>Vincent shook his head as Corrado pulled the car behind a vacant building, partially concealing it beside a Dumpster. \u201cI never imagined you\u2019d be the one to give me a pep talk about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you heard my wife,\u201d he said as he cut the engine. \u201cShe told me to come home, and I need you to have a level head for that to be possible.\u201d</p><p>They climbed out and walked alongside the building, staying out of sight. Corrado stopped when he reached the corner, and Vincent spotted a black Mercedes parked among some trees.</p><p>\u201cSquint\u2019s car,\u201d Corrado said, reaching into his coat for one of his guns. \u201cI\u2019m going to check it out. Cover me.\u201d</p><p>Vincent pulled out a gun and flicked off the safety as Corrado jogged across the road. He peered into the car and tried the doors as Vincent watched for signs of movement. Corrado looked around, glancing into the windows of an old business, before returning. \u201cIt\u2019s empty.\u201d</p><p>Vincent started to speak when a loud noise rang out behind them, startling him into silence. He swung around, aiming his weapon, but Corrado pulled him around the corner instead. Multiple rushed voices blurred together, cutting through the night as they hid alongside the vacant building Corrado had checked out moments earlier.</p><p>Three men stepped out from a warehouse and paused in the spot Vincent and Corrado had been standing moments ago. Vincent recognized Squint, a guy with shaggy blond hair nonchalantly clutching an AK-47 beside him. It was one of Volkov\u2019s guys, one who had been in the pizzeria. The third man was vaguely familiar, but Vincent couldn\u2019t place him in the dark.</p><p>\u201cBrazen,\u201d Corrado said. \u201cBrave and careless. It\u2019s a dangerous combination.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDemented is what they are,\u201d Vincent said as Squint pulled out a set of keys and tossed them to the third guy. He and the man with the AK-47 disappeared inside.</p><p>\u201cUnlocked,\u201d Corrado observed. \u201cI suppose we can add stupid to the list of adjectives.\u201d</p><p>The third guy sprinted across the street toward Squint\u2019s car as Corrado slipped around to the back of the building. Vincent took a few steps around to the front, remaining in the shadows. He reached the corner just as Corrado warded off the guy, pointing his gun at his head.</p><p>The guy threw up his hands as he dropped the keys. \u201cCorrado.\u201d</p><p>The voice struck Vincent as familiar. His stomach sank. \u201cTarullo?\u201d</p><p>The guy turned, fear flashing across his face. Dean Tarullo, the youngest son of the man who had saved Carmine\u2019s life.</p><p>\u201cUh, Vincent, sir,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>Before Vincent could respond, Corrado threw the boy against the side of the building, patting him down. Pressing his gun into the boy\u2019s throat, his finger lightly touched the trigger. \u201cYou know why we\u2019re here. How many people are inside?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive or six, I think. Maybe more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a good enough answer. Think harder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw six.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter,\u201d Corrado said. \u201cAre they all armed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe ones I saw were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou better figure it out,\u201d Corrado said, \u201cbefore I kill you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit! Okay! Nunzio\u2019s the only one I know. He talked me into this. I didn\u2019t realize what he was doing. I didn\u2019t know he was\u2014\u201d</p><p>His rambling was cut off when Corrado slammed his gun into the side of his head. \u201cI\u2019m only interested in names.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNunzio . . . that girl, the nurse.\u201d</p><p>Vincent\u2019s anger festered, seeping into his taut muscles. \u201cJen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, her. There are some others I don\u2019t know, but an older man\u2019s in charge. Ivan, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what about the girl?\u201d Corrado asked. \u201cHaven?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, uh, I know they have her, but I haven\u2019t looked around. I\u2019ve only gone in twice, and I never went past the doorway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t seen her at all?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head frantically as headlights of an approaching car flashed in their direction. They all tensed as the black BMW crept down the street. Vincent stalked to the front of the building cautiously, watching as it stopped less than a block away. The passenger door opened and a person hopped out before the car pulled out of sight.</p><p>Vincent\u2019s eyes widened when the person stepped under a streetlight, giving him a clear view of his son. Carmine haphazardly approached the building, clutching a gun in his shaking hand.</p><p>Corrado groaned. \u201cStop him.\u201d</p><p>Vincent sprinted across the street when Carmine went for the door. His hand grasped the handle as Vincent reached him, and Carmine turned in his direction.</p><p>\u201cDa\u2014\u201d he started, but Vincent dragged him away before he could react. He cursed and stumbled. \u201cWhat the fuck? She might be in there!\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep your voice down,\u201d Vincent said. \u201cYou can\u2019t just walk in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else am I supposed to do?\u201d he asked, frantic. \u201cDo you know how long it\u2019s been? Do you know how long she\u2019s been gone? I have to find her!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI know.

Carmine resisted at first, but he was too exhausted to put up a fight. Vincent took him to where Corrado stood in the darkness, with Dean huddled against the wall at his feet.</p><p>Corrado shook his head. \u201cYou must not have any sense of self-preservation left.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFuck my life,\u201d Carmine said. \u201cShe\u2019s worth dying for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what happens when you die?\u201d Corrado gave him a pointed look. \u201cYour carelessness is going to get her killed. You\u2019re in the fold now. You need to start thinking like one of us.\u201d</p><p>Carmine shot his father a panicked look. \u201cWhatever, I need to save her, that\u2019s what I need to do.\u201d Frazzled, he motioned toward Dean. \u201cWho\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a friend,\u201d Corrado said. \u201cAlthough he\u2019s more of a friend to Nunzio, it seems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, he\u2019s in on this?\u201d Carmine rushed forward and grabbed Dean by the collar. \u201cShe better not be hurt! What did you do to her?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t do anything to her!\u201d Dean said. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen her!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck do you mean you haven\u2019t seen her?\u201d Carmine snapped, slamming the boy against the building. \u201cYou took my girl from me, and I want her back!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s so much like you it\u2019s disturbing,\u201d Corrado said, glancing at Vincent as Carmine kicked Dean in the ribs.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll kill him,\u201d Vincent warned.</p><p>Corrado grabbed Carmine, begrudgingly forcing him away. \u201cEnough.\u201d</p><p>Vincent helped Dean to his feet. \u201cWhere were you going?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUh, food,\u201d he said. \u201cI was supposed to get food.\u201d</p><p>The brush nearby ruffled. Carmine and Vincent reached for their weapons as a precaution, but Corrado didn\u2019t move. He addressed the person without turning around. \u201cGiovanni.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCorrado, Vincent,\u201d Giovanni said, strolling up to them. \u201cNice to see you gentlemen again.\u201d</p><p>Carmine looked at his uncle. \u201cHow did you know it was him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always know my surroundings,\u201d Corrado said, his attention going back to Dean. \u201cIf you want me to show you any mercy, you\u2019re going to walk inside and say you were jumped. Say some thugs stole your money and Squint\u2019s keys. Understand?\u201d</p><p>Dean staggered away as the four men positioned themselves beside the entrance. Vincent pulled his gun out as Carmine fidgeted, the tension coming from him intense. \u201cYou\u2019re pissed at me, aren\u2019t you? I had to do it. I needed to find her. I need her to be okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see how throwing your life away helps anything, but now isn\u2019t the time for this.\u201d He needed to remain calm, and dwelling on what his son did would get him riled up again. \u201cWe\u2019re going to go in here and end this, and no matter what we find, we\u2019ll deal with it.\u201d</p><p>Within a matter of seconds, the door burst open and a vaguely familiar Russian man with blond hair rushed out. He froze, raising his gun as Corrado and Giovanni ducked inside the building, but Vincent was faster. Aiming, Vincent fired off a round that hit him square between the eyes. The back of his head exploded, blood splattering, and he slammed to the ground. Vincent grabbed the door and slipped inside, momentarily stunned by what he saw. People clamored and dodged flying bullets, the sound of most of the noise muffled by silencers. Carmine came in behind him, ducking to the side in the flurry of gunfire.</p> <p>Corrado stood by the front door, firing at a cowering Ivan, while Squint hid behind a table a few feet away, loading a gun. Vincent fired a few shots as Squint finished and pointed his weapon to fire back. Vincent\u2019s first two bullets barely missed as he shielded himself, but the third one struck Squint in the chest. A loud gasp escaped his mouth as he slumped backward.</p><p>Something nearby caught Vincent\u2019s attention as a bullet whizzed right by him, grazing his neck. He flinched at the searing pain, giving a wounded Squint barely enough time to get the upper hand. He fired off some back-to-back rounds, a bullet ripping through Vincent\u2019s left shoulder as more flew past him. His arm went numb, burning coursing through his upper body as his son screamed.</p><p>Vincent turned at the sound as Carmine grasped his right arm, blood flowing through his shirt. Carmine recovered and grabbed his gun as Vincent swung back around to Squint.</p><p>He had shot his son.</p><p>Firing quickly, Vincent took a few steps toward Squint, his vision narrowing with the flash of the gun barrel as he pumped bullet after bullet into him. Three slammed into Squint\u2019s chest, piercing his heart. Horrid gasps tore from him as he struggled to breathe.</p><p>Vincent paused over Squint, glaring down at his incapacitated form. He tried to pull himself away, straining to get ahold of his gun, but the life faded from him. Vincent aimed at his head and stared him in the eyes, seeing not an ounce of fear in Squint\u2019s expression as he stared back. Cold and heartless, even down to his last seconds. No remorse for what he had done.</p><p>\u201cArrivederci,\u201d Vincent said.</p><p>There was a flash of fire in Squint\u2019s eyes at the word as he picked up his gun. Vincent fired off rounds in succession, bullets ripping through his skull.</p><p>Squint\u2019s finger squeezed the trigger as a knee-jerk reaction, and a bullet flew off to the side as his body violently shook. Vincent didn\u2019t stop until the gun clicked, leaving the mangled form unrecognizable.</p><p>He didn\u2019t have any time to dwell before the deafening sound of an AK-47 ripped through the building, louder than the other muffled gunfire. Bullets slammed all around him, and Vincent ducked for cover as he grabbed his second gun. He flicked the safety off and fired at the man with the weapon, hitting him in the leg. The man stumbled but continued to shoot, another bullet grazing Vincent in the chaos.</p><p>Giovanni ran from the gunfire but couldn\u2019t dive for cover fast enough. Bullets tore into him, and he cried out, attempting a few wayward shots as he collapsed.</p><p>Vincent\u2019s gun clicked as he ran out of ammunition, and he struggled to reload as Carmine started shooting a few feet away. One of his bullets hit the man in the back, and he staggered, struggling to stay on his feet. Corrado aimed at that moment, finally turning his focus from Ivan, and fired three rounds into the man\u2019s head without hesitation. He collapsed, his finger clutching the trigger and wildly spraying bullets. Corrado stumbled a few steps as he was hit from the side, but he stayed on his feet, his attention going back to Ivan.</p><p>A female\u2019s piercing scream shattered the air, the sound sending a cold chill down Vincent\u2019s spine. Carmine immediately ran in the direction of the noise, and Vincent chased after him as Corrado covered them.</p><p>On the filthy mattress in the corner, a body folded into itself. Jen obstructed their view as she stood over it, her eyes wide with fear, her hands in the air as if to surrender. \u201cI\u2019m sorry!\u201d</p><p>An eerie silence fell over them as they stared at her. It passed as quickly as it came, however, and Carmine reacted . . . but Vincent was faster. He blocked Carmine\u2019s line of sight and pulled the trigger, shooting Jen between the eyes. Riddled with shame, he stood over her as she dropped.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t let his son be the one to carry that burden.</p><p>Staggering, an injured Ivan grabbed a discarded AK-47 from the floor as a last ditch effort. Vincent lunged for Carmine, throwing him to the ground as the spray of bullets rang out. They fired back, bullets tearing into Ivan from all directions. Vincent watched in horror as Corrado was shot again and dropped to his knees.</p><p>Vincent jumped up, his rage taking over, and three bullets struck Ivan in the head. He rushed toward his brother-in-law as Ivan dropped hard, taking out a metal chair on his way down. Vincent glanced around cautiously to make sure it was safe before dropping his gun and crouching down. Corrado wheezed and clutched his bloody chest, his face pale.</p><p>\u201cLet me see,\u201d Vincent said, prying Corrado\u2019s hands away. He ripped his shirt open, exposing three entrance wounds on his chest. \u201cThis isn\u2019t good, Corrado. We need to get you to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d he said, pushing Vincent away as he struggled to get to his feet. He swayed a bit but stood on his own, refusing help.</p><p>\u201cHaven!\u201d Carmine\u2019s voice pulled Vincent\u2019s attention away. His breath left him at the sight of Carmine sitting on the edge of the mattress, pulling the limp body into his arms.</p><p>Vincent approached, fearing the worst. She was barely recognizable from the girl who had stood in his house a few weeks earlier, instead resembling the girl he had picked up more than a year before. She had dropped a lot of weight, her skin blotchy and lips tinged blue.</p><p>Vincent grabbed her wrist. Her pulse was weak, her hand freezing and arm twisted in an odd direction. Vincent could see her chest moving rapidly with shallow breaths. Feverish, her pupils constricted, she didn\u2019t react with any of her reflexes, her neurological system not functioning normally.</p><p>In less than a minute, Vincent knew what was wrong. The problem was, he couldn\u2019t fix it.</p><p>\u201cIs she okay?\u201d Carmine caressed her face. \u201cChrist, why isn\u2019t she waking up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m assuming she\u2019s been drugged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut is she going to be all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I knew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re always trying to play doctor with me, and the one goddamn time I ask you for help, that\u2019s what you give me? You wish you knew?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to get her somewhere to assess her,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she better stay that way,\u201d Carmine said. \u201cHaven, I need you to wake up. Please, baby. You have to make it. I can\u2019t do this if you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Vincent\u2019s chest ached at his son\u2019s outburst of emotion. \u201cI\u2019ll do what I can for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf she doesn\u2019t make it, I\u2019ll fucking kill them all. Every single one of them.\u201d</p><p>Corrado\u2019s voice rang out beside them. \u201cToo late. They\u2019re already dead.\u201d</p><p>Carmine glared at his uncle. \u201cWell, we\u2019ll bring those motherfuckers back to life, then.\u201d</p><p>Corrado tried to take a step, but his knees buckled. Vincent grabbed him before he hit the floor. \u201cI need to get you to a hospital right now.\u201d</p><p>He scoffed, pushing Vincent away. \u201cI\u2019ll take myself and make something up. You need to get some men over here to clean up this mess before it takes us all down.\u201d</p><p>He limped away, his pain visible in his movements, but he didn\u2019t verbalize it. Corrado looked at the bodies scattered around, his eyes falling on Giovanni. \u201cChe peccato.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. It\u2019s a pity,\u201d Vincent said, pulling out his phone as Corrado staggered toward the door. He watched, worry eating away at him. \u201cAre you sure about this? You\u2019re losing a lot of blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ignorant, Vincent,\u201d he said. \u201cGet Haven to my house and fix her before your son resorts to resuscitating people just to kill them again.\u201d</p><p>Corrado paused near the exit and pulled out his gun, turning back around. He glanced across the room to where young Dean sat quietly in shock and fired three times into the boy, startling Carmine. \u201cFuck! I thought you were going to show him some mercy!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Corrado dropped his gun to the floor. \u201cI did. Death is a lot more humane than what would\u2019ve happened had he still been breathing when Salvatore arrived.\u201d</p><p>All Haven could see were fireworks.</p><p>Flashes of light broke through in the darkness, loud bangs ringing out in the distance. She didn\u2019t know what was real anymore, where she was or what was happening, but one thing she was sure about was the fireworks. It reminded her of the day Carmine had taken her to the party. She could still feel him, and a million butterflies invaded her system, leaving her weakened and dizzy.</p><p>\u201cJust fireworks, tesoro. Nothing to be afraid of,\u201d he had said. \u201cThey won\u2019t hurt you.\u201d</p> <p>She believed that as she lay there, just as she had the day he first spoke those words. She felt no fear and believed they couldn\u2019t harm her. Nothing would. Carmine would come for her, and he would save her, because that was what they did for each other. Although she was drowning, slipping further away, she knew she would be fine as long as she didn\u2019t give in.</p><p>They couldn\u2019t have her spirit. She wouldn\u2019t let them win.</p><p>So as she lay in the darkness, listening to the fireworks, she fought to hold on with what little strength she had left.</p><p>The fireworks faded, the moment lost, but his faint voice continued to register with her ears. The tiny hairs on her arms stood up as her skin tingled, the sensation so real she could smell his cologne. It drew her closer to the surface as it swirled all around. She wondered if it was a mirage, like a thirsty man in the midst of a hot, dry desert who saw a lake that wasn\u2019t there. Was she so desperate for him to come that her senses tricked her into believing he had?</p><p>Yes, she thought. She must be hallucinating again.</p> <p>Light filtered through her eyelids as Carmine\u2019s voice grew louder. She forced her eyes open at the sound, blinking rapidly in an attempt to clear her vision. Everything was hazy, but she could make out the familiar face, the sight of it nearly stilling her weary heart.</p><p>It didn\u2019t even seem to want to beat right anymore.</p><p>Carmine turned his head, his eyes meeting hers. They were clearer than everything else, the green color striking amidst the fog. \u201cFuck!\u201d he spat, sending chills through her body. Her vision blurred more, and she blinked rapidly, anxious to stay conscious. \u201cFucking ninja, you scared me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarmine?\u201d She winced from the burn in her throat.</p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s me. I told you I\u2019d find you. I was never gonna give up.\u201d His voice was fueled with emotion as he ran his hand along her cheek. \u201cGod, I fucking love you.\u201d</p><p>She tried to reach for him, but the movement sapped every ounce of energy from her. Everything went black again as soon as her hand dropped, noises fading out as if she were drowning again.</p> <p>\u201cHappy new year,\u201d she whispered as he disappeared.</p><p>50</p><p>Haven had no way to gauge how much time had passed while she was out\u2014it could have been hours or days, even months before she slowly started having moments of clarity, ones she knew were real because of the pain. She heard noises during one of her spells and pushed to regain consciousness. She was in a dark room, but she could make out a form standing a few feet away. \u201cDr. DeMarco?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s me.\u201d He pulled out a stethoscope and pressed it against her chest. She jumped from the unexpected coldness, pain ricocheting through her from the movement. \u201cTry not to move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt hurts,\u201d she said, tears falling.</p><p>\u201cI know it does.\u201d He placed his hand against her forehead, and she lay as still as possible as he checked her over. The scene was dreamlike. \u201cYou\u2019re not real.\u201d</p><p>Dr. DeMarco\u2019s brow furrowed. \u201cI\u2019m not real?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not really here,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m dreaming again.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m really real.\u201d He paused as a small smile took over his lips. \u201cAt least, I think so.\u201d</p><p>She tried to smile in response, but she was weak and wasn\u2019t sure if it worked. \u201cI don\u2019t understand. How did you get here? Where\u2019s Carmine?\u201d Fear paralyzed her. \u201cDid Nunzio kill him?\u201d</p><p>She tried to sit up as she looked around the room frantically, but Dr. DeMarco blocked her. \u201cCalm down, child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d Her voice cracked. \u201cWhere is he? Is he hurt? Is that why he isn\u2019t here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s fine. He just had something to take care of.\u201d</p><p>She narrowed her eyes suspiciously as he averted his gaze. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not important right now,\u201d he said. \u201cCarmine will be back soon, and he\u2019ll be elated you\u2019re awake.\u201d</p><p>Nothing made sense. \u201cI\u2019m confused.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI imagine you are.\u201d He gave her a wary look. \u201cYou were drugged when you were away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrugged.\u201d Flashes of memory hit her. A man injecting her a few times, his voice unfamiliar.</p><p>\u201cI assume it was their way of keeping you subdued. You probably don\u2019t remember much, and it\u2019s best you don\u2019t strain yourself trying to.\u201d His tone told her he meant business. \u201cYour body overdosed on the medication, so when you came off it you went through withdrawal. It would\u2019ve been best to take you to a hospital, but there was no way to explain your condition along with the thiopental and phenobarbital in your system.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re some powerful drugs we use at the hospital. I\u2019m assuming that\u2019s where Jen came into play. Thiopental is, uh . . .\u201d He looked wracked with guilt. \u201cIt\u2019s what I\u2019ve given you a few times. In low doses it will subdue someone, but higher doses result in a coma. The other slows brain function. With those two used together, I\u2019ll be shocked if you remember anything at all.\u201d</p><p>She started to reply but stopped abruptly when he pulled out a syringe. History told her nothing good came from needles.</p><p>\u201cMorphine for the pain,\u201d he explained when he noticed her reaction, gently picking up her arm. She glanced at the IV attached to her, watching as Dr. DeMarco injected the drug into her vein. \u201cYou were in bad shape when we found you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long has it been?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the twenty-ninth of October.\u201d He eyed her cautiously. \u201cYou disappeared September thirtieth.\u201d</p><p>A month had passed, and she had little recollection of it.</p><p>\u201cThey had you for two weeks,\u201d he said. \u201cThe other two you have spent recuperating here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s here?\u201d Exhaustion crept in fast as numbness overtook her body.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in Chicago at my sister\u2019s house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChicago,\u201d she said, vaguely recalling a man telling her that before. She had no energy to make sense of it, especially considering she had already forgotten what she wanted to say in the first place.</p><p>The dim hospital corridor smelled strongly of antiseptic. The suffocating stench of misery hung in the air, thicker than the night before. The feel of death was stronger, the desperation greater. It was a sensation Vincent still hadn\u2019t gotten used to.</p><p>The sound of his footsteps bounced off the sterilized walls as he made his way to room 129. Pushing open the door, he stepped inside the darkened ICU room. As soon as his eyes adjusted, he saw his sister curled up in the gray chair. Her eyes were closed, her breathing steady. Quietly, he grabbed an extra blanket from the cabinet and covered her up. Waking her was pointless\u2014she never went home when he told her to.</p><p>He turned to the bed, his blurry, tired eyes inspecting the numerous machines. The steady hum of the ventilator drowned out almost every noise, but the tube that had been taped in Corrado\u2019s mouth the past two weeks was no longer there. He had gotten a tracheotomy overnight, a tube now running straight into the front of his throat. The sight of it made Vincent\u2019s stomach sink.</p><p>More complications, one after another. Corrado couldn\u2019t catch a break.</p><p>He\u2019d been dead on arrival, but a young ER doctor refused to write him off. After a valiant attempt, they had managed to get Corrado\u2019s heart beating again. It had remained steady since then, but he was in a coma, his body giving no indication it ever intended to wake up.</p><p>Vincent watched for a while, feeling helpless and entirely to blame. He couldn\u2019t bear to think of what would happen if Corrado never regained consciousness. But even if he did, Vincent was plagued with the possible side effects. There could be massive brain damage, seizures, or paralysis. If he woke up, he may never be the same.</p><p>And that terrified him more than the possibility of the man dying.</p><p>Celia stirred, her eyes opening and meeting Vincent\u2019s right away. She sat up, stretching. \u201cHow long have you been here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a few minutes,\u201d he said. \u201cI would\u2019ve come sooner, but the girl woke up.\u201d</p><p>Optimism shined from Celia. It was out of place in the dismal hospital room. \u201cHow is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s . . . alive. She has a long road of recovery ahead of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet Carmine\u2019s relieved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t know,\u201d Vincent said. \u201cHe was at Sal\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Celia cringed. \u201cHow did you explain that to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t. It\u2019s time for Carmine to handle things on his own. Time for him to be a man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound like Dad,\u201d Celia said.</p><p>It was Vincent\u2019s turn to cringe, but he kept his opinion to himself. \u201cIt\u2019s after seven. You should go home and get some sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already slept.\u201d</p><p>Stubborn woman. \u201cDozing in a chair doesn\u2019t count. If you keep it up, you\u2019ll end up in a bed on the floor below, committed for exhaustion.\u201d</p><p>Celia climbed to her feet and pressed a kiss on Corrado\u2019s forehead. \u201cI\u2019ll go home when he can.\u201d</p><p>Vincent\u2019s chest constricted as he watched his sister care for her husband, lovingly smoothing his hair and fixing his hospital gown. \u201cWhat if that doesn\u2019t happen?\u201d</p><p>Celia\u2019s shoulders stiffened. \u201cDon\u2019t say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to consider the possibility.\u201d</p><p>Anger flared in her dark eyes. \u201cHe\u2019ll wake up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but . . . what if he doesn\u2019t? Corrado wouldn\u2019t want to be lying in a bed like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019d want to live, and he will. He\u2019s getting stronger every day.\u201d</p><p>His sister sounded certain, but Vincent knew too much to succumb to her hopeful words. \u201cThe longer he\u2019s unconscious, the less likely it is he\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Celia said, cutting him off. \u201cI\u2019ve heard the doctors, but they don\u2019t know Corrado like I do. He\u2019ll come out of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he told me he would. When he left the house, he said he\u2019d come back to me. Corrado has never broken his word.\u201d</p><p>Haven awoke again to a bright room, squinting from the harsh light filtering in the window. She groaned as she turned away from the sunlight, her hand coming into contact with a body in bed beside her. Carmine was asleep, his chest rising and falling at a steady pace, his right arm wrapped from his fingers up past his elbow with an elastic bandage. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Clenching her jaw, she fought back the cry that threatened to come out as she rolled onto her side, the needle in her arm pulling when she reached toward Carmine. She hesitated an inch from his face, not wanting to disturb him, before running her fingertips along the bridge of his nose. There was a small bump that hadn\u2019t existed before, and she knew firsthand where something like that came from.</p><p>Carmine stirred, grumbling incoherently before his eyes drifted open. He jumped, nearly falling off the bed as she quickly pulled her hand away.</p><p>\u201cShit, you\u2019re awake!\u201d he said. A smile spread across her face at the sound of his voice. She fought back her emotion, but it was too much to handle. Tears flowed down her cheeks, and he wiped them away. \u201cAre you okay? Are you hurt? Wait, of course you\u2019re hurt!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re not fine,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re hurt, tesoro. Do you know how much you scared me? I thought I was gonna lose you! When I woke up in that car and you were gone, I thought my life was over. But I swore I\u2019d never give up, and I didn\u2019t. I couldn\u2019t think about going on if you were dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not dead,\u201d she said through her tears.</p><p>\u201cYes, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo buts,\u201d she interrupted. \u201cI thought I was going to lose you, too. I begged them to leave you alone in the car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou begged them?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey were going to kill you.\u201d Her voice cracked as the memory resurfaced. \u201cI told them I\u2019d go with them, that I wouldn\u2019t fight as long as they let you live. I would\u2019ve given up anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would\u2019ve sacrificed yourself for me?\u201d he asked, his expression serious. \u201cYou\u2019d throw your life away if it meant I\u2019d keep mine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Wouldn\u2019t you do the same?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I would.\u201d</p><p>He tried to pull her into a hug, but it wasn\u2019t easy maneuvering around their injuries. They both groaned and cringed from pain, his bandaged arm making the embrace awkward. \u201cYour arm,\u201d she said, nuzzling into his chest.</p><p>\u201cThe bone fractured when I was shot, so they had to splint it.\u201d</p> <p>She tensed. \u201cYou were shot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. It\u2019s not that serious, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot serious? Someone shot you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Nunzio did.\u201d</p><p>She gasped. \u201cOh God, where is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s dead,\u201d Carmine said. \u201cHim and the rest of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re dead?\u201d He nodded. \u201cAll of them?\u201d Another nod. \u201cAnd you aren\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>He cracked a smile at her question. \u201cLast time I checked,\u201d he said, reaching for her hand and pressing it against his chest, over his heart. \u201cI think it\u2019s still beating.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt is.\u201d She stared into his eyes\u2014eyes she worried she would never see again. \u201cI missed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMi sei mancata,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re awake now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere were you earlier?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t respond right away. \u201cI had an appointment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of appointment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t matter right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the same thing your father said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, there you go. We should probably listen to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a rebel,\u201d she said. \u201cSince when do you listen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never did before and look where that got us. I figure it\u2019s time to start, since he seems to know what the hell he\u2019s talking about.\u201d He paused. \u201cSometimes, anyway. Other times I still think he\u2019s full of shit.\u201d</p><p>She laughed at his response. They both lay quietly, holding on to each other as she tried to clear the fog that settled in her brain. Her memory was sketchy, an odd tension mounting in the room as a result. \u201cIs everything okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t it be?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I was worried . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, stop worrying.\u201d His voice was firm. \u201cYou need to focus on getting better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound like your father again,\u201d she said, his evasive answer doing nothing to calm her fears.</p><p>\u201cApparently I\u2019m more like him than we thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re nothing like him,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ll never be like him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be so sure.\u201d</p><p>She wondered what he meant when there was a knock on the door. Dr. DeMarco walked in, and Carmine groaned at his father\u2019s arrival. \u201cWe talked him up.\u201d</p><p>Dr. DeMarco raised his eyebrows. \u201cIt\u2019s not nice to talk about people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing I wouldn\u2019t say to your face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue, son. You\u2019ve never been one to hold your tongue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that part of my charm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t call it charm,\u201d Dr. DeMarco said. \u201cYour mouth gets you into trouble as often as it gets you out of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019s never had any complaints about my mouth,\u201d Carmine said playfully. She blushed and jabbed him in the ribs. Even though her touch was light, Carmine clenched his teeth to muffle a cry.</p><p>\u201cHe has a fractured rib,\u201d Dr. DeMarco explained when she eyed Carmine peculiarly. \u201cIt would be fine by now if he\u2019d learn to take it easy.\u201d</p><p>She felt guilty for hurting him. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t apologize.\u201d Carmine turned his attention to his father. \u201cIs there something you needed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got back from the hospital and wanted to check on her.\u201d He grabbed Haven\u2019s wrist to check her pulse before feeling her forehead. \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill mixed up, but I feel better than I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will be for a while as your body heals,\u201d he said. \u201cI want you to try to eat something. Carmine can bring you some chicken broth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can get my own,\u201d Haven said.</p><p>\u201cNonsense, child. You\u2019re far too weak for that right now,\u201d he said, shaking his head. \u201cAnyway, I\u2019m sure the two of you have a lot to talk about, but get some rest today. Carmine can also get you something for the pain. I know he knows where the narcotics are, considering he\u2019s been popping them like candy for weeks.\u201d</p><p>Haven stared at the door when Dr. DeMarco left. \u201cHe seems strange.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve noticed,\u201d Carmine muttered. \u201cHe\u2019s resolved, like he has some grand plan to save us all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo we need to be saved?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t we always?\u201d</p><p>Rhetorical question. Of course they did. \u201cIs he working at the hospital here now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he was just seeing about something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cChrist, you\u2019re full of questions. It\u2019s not something you need to worry about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I can\u2019t lie around, wondering what happened. I\u2019ll worry myself sick and never get better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea to tell you yet, but I\u2019m not gonna fight about it.\u201d</p><p>She listened as Carmine recounted waking up in the car. He explained what had happened in Durante, tears flowing from her eyes when he broke the news that Nicholas hadn\u2019t survived. Her mind drifted through scenarios, and she got lost in her thoughts, Carmine\u2019s words drifting into the background until he said something that caught her off guard. \u201cArrested?\u201d</p><p>He sighed and stood, running his left hand awkwardly through his uncombed hair. It obviously hadn\u2019t been cut in more than a month, strands covering his neck and spilling over his forehead. There was a slight curl to it at that long length. \u201cYes, and for bullshit reasons. The feds raided with warrants for my father and Corrado, and some egotistical agent named Cerone threw me in jail along with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you went to jail,\u201d she said. \u201cHow did you find me? My chip?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish,\u201d he said. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t work, and they were in jail, tesoro. I knew it would be at least another week until they got out, and I didn\u2019t know if you had that long. I had to do something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d she asked, suspicious of his cryptic words. \u201cWhatever it is, I\u2019ll understand.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you keep saying things don\u2019t matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause there are some things you shouldn\u2019t know right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t mean that,\u201d she said. \u201cYou said we\u2019d tell each other everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but things change. There are some things I can\u2019t tell you . . . some things I won\u2019t be able to tell you. It\u2019s shit you won\u2019t wanna know anyway, Haven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think you can\u2019t tell me?\u201d</p><p>He started to respond, but the ringing of his phone silenced him. Groaning, he pulled it from his pocket and shot her a nervous look as he answered. \u201cYes, sir?\u201d His tone was even, his demeanor instantly shifting. \u201cBut I don\u2019t . . . Yes, fine. I get it. I\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p><p>He sighed as he hung up and sat beside her. He took her hand, lightly placing a kiss on the back of it. \u201cNothing\u2019s more important to me than you, tesoro. I\u2019d give my life for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re scaring me, Carmine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be scared,\u201d he said. \u201cI was desperate, baby. I needed to know you were alive, and now that you\u2019re safe, I can\u2019t regret it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not making sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not surprised,\u201d he said, letting go of her hand. \u201cI have to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but I shouldn\u2019t be long. We\u2019ll talk when I get back, but I can\u2019t be late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be late for what? Tell me what you did, Carmine!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI went to Sal, okay? Is that what you fucking wanna know? I asked him to help me, so now I owe him in return.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, fighting back her panic. \u201cOwe him what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy loyalty.\u201d</p><p>She sat up, grimacing from her sudden movement. \u201cTake it back!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you can\u2019t do that! You can\u2019t be like them! You can\u2019t do those things they do. We talked about this before!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think I wanna be that person? That I wanna do those things? Of course I don\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why\u2019d you do it? How could you agree to that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t have a choice. I get it if you\u2019re upset, but it\u2019s done.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her imploringly, begging her to understand, but she couldn\u2019t in the moment. She averted her gaze when he reached over to wipe the tears from her cheeks. \u201cWe always have a choice.\u201d</p><p>His touch was gentle and should have been comforting, but it wasn\u2019t enough to extinguish her fears.</p><p>\u201cLook, it\u2019s gonna be okay,\u201d he said. \u201cNothing\u2019s changed.\u201d</p><p>Her heart ached to believe his words, but she wasn\u2019t na\u00efve. Not anymore. It was a life of crime, a world of violence where danger constantly forced its way in. It was a world that turned men cold and cynical as they did unspeakable things she couldn\u2019t fathom. It was a world that had taken both of their mamas and had nearly killed them, too. It was a world they had tried to escape, but one that sucked them in, anyway. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It wasn\u2019t the world she had envisioned for their future.</p><p>All she could think about were their plans slipping away. Going somewhere no one knew them, starting over fresh where he could just be him and she could just be her, untainted by slavery and the labels forced upon them. Going to college so he could play football while she studied art\u2014all of it a distant dream. Getting married and having a family\u2014the concept overshadowed by reality. She wasn\u2019t sure what was possible anymore, where they could go or what they could do. Would he be allowed to go to school? Could they bring children into that world?</p><p>More importantly, what would happen to Carmine? Could he live that life and be the same person she loved? Could someone do bad things, but not be a bad person? After being brutalized her entire life, how could she accept him becoming one of them?</p><p>How had Maura done it?</p> <p>Vincent stood at the front of the dim church, staring at the flickering flame of the candle he had lit. It glowed brightly, illuminating his hand as he sullenly made the sign of the cross. There was a quiet shuffling behind him after a moment. Vincent turned to see Father Alberto approaching, clutching a Bible. He nodded at the priest. \u201cFather.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are you, my child?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m well.\u201d</p><p>Father Alberto shook his head. \u201cThere are certain people in life you can never fool, Vincenzo, and your priest is one of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are the others?\u201d he asked curiously. \u201cMy mother?\u201d</p> <p>The sober old priest actually barked with laughter. \u201cI\u2019ve known your mother for decades. I can safely say she sees and hears only what she wants, nothing more. It\u2019s a gift with that woman.\u201d</p><p>Vincent smiled. \u201cShould you talk that way about people?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not judging,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m simply telling the truth. While in church. It\u2019s a nice concept. Would you like to give it a try?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll ask again. How are you, my child?\u201d</p><p>Vincent hesitated. \u201cTerrified.\u201d</p> <p>There was no surprise in Father Alberto\u2019s expression. \u201cWhat scares you, Vincenzo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCorrado\u2019s in the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard. Is he getting better?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that I can tell,\u201d he said. \u201cCelia believes he\u2019ll be fine, that he\u2019ll wake up soon, but I don\u2019t see how. His brain went without oxygen for too long for him to walk away from this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long was he without oxygen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost four minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it impossible to recover after being down for four minutes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cImpossible? No, but it is improbable.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA doctor would also say an Immaculate Conception is improbable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, a doctor would say an Immaculate Conception is impossible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut yet Mother Mary had Jesus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiracles happen,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason you don\u2019t see what Celia does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m a doctor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, because you\u2019ve lost your faith.\u201d</p><p>Vincent looked at the priest with disbelief. \u201cIf that were true, I wouldn\u2019t come here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the contrary, Vincenzo. You come here because you wish to find your faith again. You can\u2019t fool God, either. He knows everything, and it\u2019s okay, because He\u2019ll forgive you. The question is whether you\u2019re ready to be forgiven.\u201d</p><p>He was quiet, turning back to the lit candle. \u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen ask.\u201d</p><p>Vincent took a deep breath before speaking again. \u201cForgive me, Father, for I have sinned.\u201d</p><p>Father Alberto\u2019s voice was gentle. \u201cGo on. You\u2019re safe here.\u201d</p><p>The word safe made him hesitate again. For the first time since he was that young boy, walking into the church and believing he belonged, he felt like he was truly safe there.</p><p>\u201cThe first time I killed a man, I was eighteen. I shot him once in the heart with my revolver. He lost consciousness instantly, but it took exactly a minute and twenty-nine seconds for him to stop breathing. I counted. Seems so quick in retrospect, but while I watched it happen, it felt like he\u2019d never die. And the whole time I stood there, all I could think was how wrong it seemed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrong because you shouldn\u2019t have killed him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, wrong because there wasn\u2019t enough blood. Some seeped out onto his shirt, and his nose bled as he choked on a bit, but it was a relatively clean scene. He bled out internally. I thought a shot to the heart should\u2019ve been messier.\u201d</p><p>Father Alberto was silent for a moment. \u201cWhy did you kill him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe raped my wife,\u201d he said, his voice an octave above a whisper. \u201cI was judge, jury, and executioner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t think God would make him pay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cI just made it so he\u2019d face God sooner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Vincent\u2019s brow furrowed. \u201cI told you why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told me what this man did wrong, what sin he committed, but you didn\u2019t tell me why you killed him. I remember you at eighteen. I married you and Maura at eighteen. You weren\u2019t a vengeful person, and Maura wouldn\u2019t have wanted you to do it.\u201d</p><p>The priest was right, of course. \u201cMy father sanctioned it, called it my wedding present. I hadn\u2019t wanted to, but it wasn\u2019t open for negotiation. Permission to kill him was my first order, my first test. He thought he was doing me a favor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat other favors did your father do for you?\u201d</p><p>Vincent shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t think there are enough hours in the day to tell you it all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have time,\u201d the priest said. \u201cJust as long as you\u2019re finished by Sunday morning.\u201d</p><p>Vincent laughed at that.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Father Alberto said, motioning toward the confessional. \u201cWe will do this right.\u201d</p><p>The candle still flickered, and Vincent gazed at it before following him. The moment he sat down in the confessional, the words flooded from his lips. He spilled it all, every sinful thing he had done in his life\u2014the men he had murdered, the places he had robbed, the people he had hurt. Every shameful act, every scornful word. Vincent didn\u2019t stop until it was all out in the open.</p><p>\u201cHow do you feel?\u201d Father Alberto asked when he finished.</p><p>How did he feel? He felt relief. He felt at ease. He felt as if a burden had been lifted from his shoulders, a weight no longer pressing on his chest. He felt freer, lighter. He felt forgiveness. He felt peace. \u201cI feel like painting a door blue today.\u201d</p><p>Shifting uncomfortably in the chair, Haven gazed through the large window at the world outside. It was close to dusk and dozens of kids wandered the street in costumes, stopping at houses with their colorful buckets for candy. She watched them, longing brewing inside her. They were all so young and carefree, ignorant to the dangers lurking a few feet from them. She had never known that type of innocence. When she was their age, the monsters in her life had been real.</p><p>\u201cHey, Twinkle Toes.\u201d</p><p>She turned at the unexpected voice and saw Dominic in the doorway. He smiled as he walked forward, pulling an orange pumpkin-shaped lollipop from his pocket. He handed it to her, and Carmine groaned from his spot on the bed. He hadn\u2019t left her side since going to his meeting with Salvatore days ago.</p><p>\u201cShe can barely keep soup down, and you\u2019re giving her candy?\u201d</p><p>Dominic rolled his eyes. \u201cWhen did you become her guardian? She\u2019s her own woman. Let her have a sucker. It won\u2019t kill her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d Carmine said, standing. \u201cI\u2019ll get her something real to eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you do that, Martha Stewart,\u201d Dominic said. \u201cGo knit her a scarf while you\u2019re at it. Maybe some booties, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVaffanculo,\u201d Carmine hollered as he walked out.</p><p>Dominic turned to her. \u201cThat boy needs to chill before he bursts a blood vessel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s trying to help,\u201d she said. \u201cGive him a break.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know he\u2019s trying to help, but that\u2019s no excuse to deny someone candy on Halloween.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for it,\u201d she said, pulling off the wrapper and sucking on it. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize it was Halloween until I saw the treatsters.\u201d</p><p>He sat on the arm of the chair beside her and laughed. \u201cThey\u2019re called trick-or-treaters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She looked back out at the kids in costumes. \u201cI didn\u2019t know, since I\u2019ve never been. I didn\u2019t have a normal childhood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNormal is a relative term,\u201d he said. \u201cBesides, it\u2019s never too late to trick-or-treat. Maybe we\u2019ll go one of these years.\u201d</p><p>She smiled, knowing Dominic would actually do it. \u201cI\u2019d like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to see you. I would\u2019ve come sooner, but Tess made me promise to leave you alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re here. It\u2019s nice to see friendly faces again.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cSo, how are you holding up? Can\u2019t be easy losing a month of your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m alive,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s more than I can say for some people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNicholas,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cHe didn\u2019t deserve what happened. He was a good friend, always had a joke for anyone who would listen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did.\u201d Tears formed, guilt eating away at her. \u201cIt\u2019s dumb, but I can\u2019t stop thinking about the last joke he told me. He was telling one when he was shot, but he never got to say the answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? What was the joke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s black, white, and red all over?\u201d</p><p>Dominic laughed. \u201cClassic Nicholas. He\u2019d give a different bullshit answer every time he told that joke, like a penguin with sunburn or a zebra with chicken pox. The real answer is a newspaper, though. It\u2019s black and white, and read all over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She sat there for a moment before a light laugh escaped her lips. \u201cI like that one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not stupid to think about it. He\u2019d be honored to be remembered by his jokes,\u201d he said, patting her head. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re up and moving around. Everyone\u2019s been worried, but I never doubted everything would turn out all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I was as sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs hard as it is, you have to have hope. Remember I told you before? What my brother did sucks, but if I was in his shoes, I would\u2019ve done the same thing, and I know you would, too. So maybe I\u2019m not the only one who needs to give Carmine a break. I\u2019m sure somehow you guys will figure things out, and it won\u2019t be the ideal fairy tale, but when is life? Especially for the two of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyway, I should go.\u201d Dominic stood and froze, clearing his throat. \u201cDamn, that was quick, bro. You\u2019re a regular ol\u2019 Betty Crocker these days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t make it, motherfucker.\u201d Carmine handed Haven a bowl of vegetable soup. \u201cI just poured it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell, you did a damn fine job at that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, asshole,\u201d Carmine said, feigning annoyance as an amused smile formed on his lips. \u201cDon\u2019t you have shit to go break with a sword or something? It\u2019s Halloween.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, that reminds me! Today\u2019s the anniversary of the first time you two crazy kids made out.\u201d</p><p>Haven smiled. \u201cIt was when I kissed him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI still can\u2019t believe you made the first move. Bet you\u2019re regretting that decision now, huh?\u201d</p><p>Glancing at Carmine, she took in his solemn expression. \u201cI\u2019ll never regret it.\u201d</p><p>His face lit up at her words, and she was immediately ashamed for her thoughts. She was still hurt, unsure of what the future held, but one thing Carmine had never done was give up on her. She mourned a life she thought she lost, but it was a life she would have never dreamed of having if he hadn\u2019t fought for her in the first place. He had sacrificed for her, his world irrevocably altered to give her a chance. Carmine deserved a life outside of the violence.</p><p>How would she forgive herself if he didn\u2019t get it?</p><p>She sighed after Dominic left, setting her bowl of soup down on the small table beside the chair. She got up, wincing from the pain in her wobbly legs, and Carmine rushed forward when he saw what she was doing. She held her hand up to stop him, taking a few weak steps on her own to him.</p> <p>\u201cI love you, Carmine DeMarco,\u201d she said, nuzzling into his chest. Her shoulder throbbed from where it had been dislocated and her knees felt as if they were going to give out, but she held on to him and ignored it all. None of those things mattered. They would fade, and with them the memory, but her love for Carmine would never go away.</p><p>He hugged her back, pulling her closer and resting his head on top of hers. Haven\u2019s smile grew. Despite everything, she still felt safest in his arms.</p><p>Haven grew stronger, her injuries healing, but she still struggled mentally as days turned into weeks. She spent most days resting, but eventually ventured outside with Carmine. He held her hand the first time they strolled down the street, pointing out different landmarks from his childhood. They were about a block away from Celia\u2019s house when her legs grew tired, and the two of them stopped in front of a large white house. Carmine pulled her to it and sat on the front porch.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you should sit on someone\u2019s steps like that,\u201d she said. \u201cThey might get angry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is our house, tesoro,\u201d he said with a small smile, continuing as she took the seat beside him. \u201cIt\u2019s where I grew up, but it\u2019s been empty since my mom . . .\u201d</p><p>Since she was murdered, Haven thought, finishing the sentence he still couldn\u2019t say. She glanced at the bright blue door, a stark contrast to the chipped red paint of the shutters.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are we going to do, Carmine?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhat happens now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe go back to Durante. Sal\u2019s gonna give me some time before he expects me to move here. Other than that, I guess we figure it out as we go.\u201d</p><p>And that was exactly what they did. A few days later, Dr. DeMarco rented a car, and the three of them made the journey back to Durante. She slept a lot, sprawled out in the backseat as Carmine and Dr. DeMarco took turns driving. They stopped so frequently it took a few days before they saw the brown wooden DURANTE WELCOMES YOU sign.</p><p>An odd sensation overcame Haven when they pulled off the faded highway and up to the familiar plantation house. It wasn\u2019t hurt or heartache, although it was deep within her chest, surrounding her heart and stealing her breath.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until Carmine muttered the words that it struck her. \u201cWe\u2019re finally home.\u201d</p><p>Home. She got it now. For the first time in her life, something felt like home. It was the place they had come together. It was where they had found love.</p><p>She finally knew what that word meant.</p><p>51</p> <p>Settling back in hadn\u2019t been easy. Memories haunted Haven\u2019s dreams and continued to follow her during her waking hours. Flashes of faces, horrific screams, and scathing words constantly ate away at her, and the worst part was she wasn\u2019t sure any of it was real.</p><p>She scribbled in notebooks again and sketched pictures of the images she saw in her mind. Her monster returned, taunting her with his scaly face and evil eyes. It reminded her that no matter where she went, that part of her life was never far away.</p><p>Carmine was just as distracted, nightmares infesting his sleep again. He would sneak out of bed at night, and sometimes she would follow, listening as he played the same song for hours on end.</p><p>They were two broken kids, desperate to be whole again, struggling to find balance in a world out of their control. What\u2019s black and white and red all over? Carmine was, Haven thought. A soul savagely ripped in half, bleeding out for all to see. The yin and yang, the good and evil, the love and pain all at odds with each other. Two sides, two vastly different worlds, but someday they would merge as one. They had to.</p><p>Il tempo guarisce tutti i mali. Time heals all wounds.</p><p>Some things in life only happen once, the memories lasting forever. They are moments that alter you, turning you into a person you never thought you would become, but someone you were destined to be. There\u2019s no magical rewind button in life, no take backs or do-overs to fix things you wish you could change.</p><p>If there were, Carmine would be eight years old again, demanding his mom wait for a car to pick them up. They wouldn\u2019t wind up in that alley, and his mom would live to see another day.</p><p>He\u2019d go back to sixteen and put his gun away instead of driving to his best friend\u2019s house in anger. Bygones would be bygones, and there would be peace, instead of public rivalries that hurt everyone in the end.</p><p>He\u2019d be in that kitchen at seventeen again, cleaning his spilled juice instead of frightening Haven so badly. He wouldn\u2019t have passed judgment on the strange girl, and maybe he would have known what love was a little sooner.</p><p>There were many places Carmine would go back to, many things he would have done differently, but one thing he wouldn\u2019t take back was what he had done to save her.</p><p>Sacrifice. It was something he learned from his mom, when she gave her life to save a young girl. He had learned it from his father, when he swore himself to an organization to be with the woman he loved. Even Corrado had put himself on the line, risking his safety to spare them more pain.</p><p>And he learned it from Nicholas, who helped a virtual stranger and got nothing in return. Nothing, that is, except a bullet to the chest, ending his short life.</p><p>If Carmine could go back, he would have truly apologized to him that day.</p><p>Life\u2019s a struggle, and it would be easy if it came with an eraser, but it didn\u2019t. What\u2019s done is done, as hard as that was to accept.</p><p>Sometimes, though, people get second chances. They get more tries. It was too late for others, but Carmine was blessed with more time. Time to try to make things right.</p><p>\u201cCarmine?\u201d</p><p>Carmine glanced at his American history teacher, Mrs. Anderson, and felt the strangest sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu at her expectant look. He had failed her class last time around and was back in it senior year, a requirement for graduation.</p><p>Not as if he counted on graduating. He had already missed more than a month of school.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your turn.\u201d</p><p>Sighing, he strolled to the front of the room, the eyes of his peers fixed on him. They expected a show, but Carmine only had one thing on his mind.</p><p>Redemption.</p><p>\u201cThe Battle of Gettysburg was fought in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania in eighteen-something-or-other. The year doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Anderson started to interrupt but closed her mouth when he continued. \u201cThey considered it the turning point of the war, and President Lincoln showed up to give his big speech. Who really cares what it was called? I don\u2019t. After it was all over and the North won, Congress passed the thirteenth amendment to free the slaves. It outlawed owning another person\u2014yada, yada, yada\u2014but it was a waste of time. All of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, Carmine?\u201d</p><p>He ignored his teacher, continuing on as if she hadn\u2019t spoken. \u201cAll those people died and it didn\u2019t change anything, because it doesn\u2019t work if they don\u2019t enforce it. They turn their backs and say it\u2019s not their problem, but it is. It\u2019s everyone\u2019s problem. They can say slavery ended all they want, but that doesn\u2019t make it true. People lie. They\u2019ll tell you what they think you wanna hear, and you\u2019ll believe it. Whatever makes you feel better about your dismal little lives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough, Carmine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, whatever. Go on being na\u00efve. Believe what the history books tell you if you want. Believe what Mrs. Anderson wants me to tell you about it. Believe the land of the free\u2014blah, blah, blah\u2014star-spangled-banner bullshit. Believe there aren\u2019t any slaves anymore because a tall guy in a big-ass top hat and a bunch of politicians said so. But I won\u2019t believe it, because if I do too, we\u2019ll all be fucking wrong, and someone has to be right here.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Anderson stood, and Carmine smiled to himself. Maybe they got a show, after all.</p><p>He grabbed his belongings and headed for the door before she could tell him to get out of her classroom. The hallway was deserted, everything silent and still as he made his way to the front office. Principal Rutledge stood near the secretary\u2019s desk, and he looked at Carmine with surprise when he walked in. \u201cDid you get in trouble?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe? Of course not.\u201d</p><p>Principal Rutledge sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s been a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but don\u2019t worry . . . It\u2019s the last time you\u2019ll have to see me.\u201d</p><p>Haven stood in the kitchen making herself lunch when Dr. DeMarco walked in. \u201cWhen you get a minute, can you come to my office?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, nervous as to why he would want to see her. She wrapped up her sandwich, her appetite gone, and placed it in the refrigerator for later. Even though he rarely left the house, since the hospital had terminated his job after news of his arrest, she and Dr. DeMarco hadn\u2019t exchanged more than basic pleasantries in weeks.</p><p>She headed up to his office when she couldn\u2019t delay it any longer and softly knocked, opening the door when he told her to enter.</p><p>\u201cHave a seat,\u201d he said, motioning toward the chair across from him. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>She sat down, watching him cautiously. \u201cI\u2019m okay, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you?\u201d He raised his eyebrows. \u201cYou don\u2019t seem okay.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, debating how to respond. \u201cI\u2019m dealing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you starting to remember things?\u201d</p><p>She was anxious about where the conversation was heading. \u201cYes, but I\u2019m not sure how much of it to believe. I hallucinated a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not my place to press you for details, but if you have any questions, I can answer them.\u201d</p><p>She debated his offer. \u201cAm I really a Principessa?\u201d</p><p>He leaned back in his chair, giving her an interested look. \u201cTechnically speaking, yes. My wife got too close to discovering that, which is why she was murdered.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Guilt consumed her. \u201cBecause of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not because of you,\u201d he said, his tone serious. \u201cFor you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there a difference?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cI once blamed you, believed it was because of you, and it took me a long time to see my anger was unfounded. There are a few people I could reasonably blame, myself included, but you aren\u2019t one of them. If I would\u2019ve realized that sooner, it could\u2019ve saved us both a lot of hurt.\u201d</p> <p>She stared at him with surprise, and he continued after a brief pause. \u201cThe day we found you in Chicago was October twelfth. I was so caught up in everything that it wasn\u2019t until the next afternoon that it dawned on me it had been the anniversary of Maura\u2019s death. Last year on that day, you didn\u2019t stand a chance. No matter what you did, I would\u2019ve gotten you, because it wasn\u2019t about you\u2014it was about her.\u201d</p><p>A chill shot down her spine at the memory of that afternoon.</p><p>\u201cI want you to know I\u2019ve never hated you. I couldn\u2019t hate you, because I never knew you. And I didn\u2019t want to know you because I didn\u2019t want to care about you. Nine years in a row, I spent October twelfth wishing I could punish you, but this year, all I could think about was rescuing you, which is what got her killed in the first place.\u201d He paused. \u201cI\u2019m talking in circles, and I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019ll believe me, but I want you to know I\u2019ve grown to care for you. And as for what I did to you last year, I don\u2019t expect forgiveness, but I am sorry about it. If I could take it back, I would.\u201d</p><p>He pushed his chair back and walked over to her, pulling up his pant leg to show his ankle bracelet. \u201cDo you know what this is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a GPS monitoring device. A stipulation of my bail was that I had to wear it.\u201d Her eyes widened, and he laughed at her expression. \u201cIt\u2019s something, isn\u2019t it? You don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to have your every move watched until it happens to you. Somewhere there\u2019s a man watching to see where I am to insure I\u2019m not trying to get away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds familiar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it does,\u201d he said. \u201cI had my reasons for chipping you, but that doesn\u2019t mean what I did was right. I called in one last favor with a colleague of mine, the one who saw Carmine after the accident, and I made an appointment for you. I may be stuck with my monitoring device, but that doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t remove yours.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth fell open as she struggled to find words. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, but I don\u2019t deserve your gratitude. I\u2019m only fixing my mistakes at this point.\u201d He sat in his chair as tears spilled down Haven\u2019s cheeks. \u201cAnyway, one more thing. I want to give this to you before our guests arrive. It could be my last Christmas with my family, so I\u2019d like to make the best of it.\u201d</p><p>His words made her stomach twist. \u201cYou think you\u2019ll go to prison?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019ll get me one way or another,\u201d he said as he opened the top drawer of his desk and pulled out a familiar leather bound book. He set it in front of her. \u201cMy wife\u2019s journal. I think you should keep it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wrote a lot about adjusting to this life and her conflicting feelings about the world I belonged to,\u201d he said. \u201cIt might help you going forward.\u201d</p><p>She picked up the book cautiously. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m positive. Maura would\u2019ve wanted it this way.\u201d</p><p>Standing, Haven headed for the door, but she hesitated before she reached it. \u201cNot long after I got here, you asked me not to call you Master because it made you feel like my father. Michael Antonelli was a horrible man, but despite everything, you\u2019ve been kinder to me than he was. So I do forgive you for hurting me, because you\u2019ve helped me more than anyone else. You\u2019re a good man, Vincent, and I think sometimes good men find themselves doing bad things.\u201d</p><p>His expression remained blank, but for the first time since meeting him, Haven saw his eyes gloss over with tears. \u201cThank you, Haven.\u201d</p><p>Haven. Her name on his lips sounded foreign as he finally said it. She wiped her tears as she walked out, knowing there was nothing left to say. She stepped out into the hallway at the same time Carmine came up the stairs. She eyed him peculiarly. \u201cYou\u2019re home early.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, school was a bust,\u201d he said, shrugging. \u201cHow are you today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>He cocked an eyebrow at her. \u201cOkay? Is that an, \u2018Okay, I\u2019m about two seconds away from finding a window to throw myself through, but I\u2019m not gonna tell you because you\u2019ll stop me,\u2019 or is it an, \u2018Okay, I\u2019m pretty fucking peachy, Carmine, so stop questioning me\u2019?\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cI\u2019m just . . . okay. Especially now that you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her before the two of them headed upstairs. Settling into the chairs in the library, Carmine grabbed his guitar as Haven gazed at the cover of the journal.</p><p>\u201cYou still reading The Secret Garden?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, I finished that book months ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? What happened in it?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t truly sound interested, his gaze on his fingers as he strummed the guitar, but she smiled at the fact that he would ask. \u201cThe girl comes to the conclusion that the mean man she lives with isn\u2019t as bad as she assumed. He\u2019s just grieving because he lost his wife. She makes friends with the son, who the father can\u2019t face for a long time, because he reminds him of his wife.\u201d</p><p>Carmine\u2019s fingers stilled, the music abruptly stopping as he looked at Haven. \u201cNo shit?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFate,\u201d he said, his eyes drifting from her to the book on her lap. \u201cMy mom\u2019s journal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah. Your father gave it to me.\u201d</p><p>He turned back to his guitar and started strumming again, music filling the room as sunshine streamed in on them from the window. She watched him in silence, her chest swelling with love as her favorite passage from The Secret Garden sprang to mind.</p><p>One of the strangest things about living in the world is that it is only now and then one is quite sure one is going to live forever and ever and ever . . . sometimes a sound of far-off music makes it true; and sometimes a look in someone\u2019s eyes.</p><p>Haven felt it then, sitting in the library with the scarred boy who had stolen her heart, his deep green eyes twinkling as the beautiful notes poured from his fingertips.</p><p>Sempre. No matter what happened next, or what went on tomorrow, nothing would ever take that away. Their love existed, despite everything else, and it was that love that would go on forever. The moment was etched in time, transcending the constraints put on them by life.</p><p>For even after they were gone, when life continued on, a part of them would always exist in everything\u2014and everyone\u2014they ever touched.</p><p>She turned back to the journal and opened it. Taking a deep breath, she read the first line:</p><p>Today is my first day as a free woman. </p> </body></html>"]
