The two of them were ganging up on him. Again. \u201cNot the fire,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAye, the fire.\u201d Cormac linked arms with Marjorie, glaring defiantly. \u201cMarjorie wants to.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut we always play the Ogilvy fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have your head,\u201d his twin shouted, ignoring him. \u201cI will claim my revenge!\u201d</p><p>Aidan narrowed his eyes. Lately, when Marjorie was around, Cormac dove heart and soul into their playacting. And somehow Aidan always ended up cast as the bad guy. \u201cWhy do I have to be Campbell again?\u201d</p><p>Marjorie stepped forward to peer at his face. \u201cBecause your nose is bigger than Cormac\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Aidan wanted to punch that nose. \u201cBut we\u2019re twins.\u201d</p> <p>Cormac shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s not my fault we don\u2019t look alike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always play the cursed Campbell.\u201d</p><p>Cormac paid no attention. Instead, he spun and grabbed Marjorie\u2019s hand. \u201cRevenge shall be mine, I say! Fear not, Lady Ogilvy, I\u2019ll save you from the blaze!\u201d</p><p>Aidan threw his wooden sword to the ground. The two of them were annoying him more than usual, and he refused to play along. \u201cWhy do you always get to save Marjorie?\u201d</p><p>Marjorie picked up his sword, thrusting it back to him hilt first. \u201cThat\u2019s just how we play it, Aidan.\u201d</p><p>Marjorie and Cormac looked at each other, all treaclyeyed. It made Aidan want to sick up.</p> <p>She sauntered to the window, swaying her hips as though she were a real woman. Cormac followed right behind, like a starved pup. She stared out, while Cormac just stared at her shoulders. \u201cYou boys should climb the chimney,\u201d she said, \u201clike the sweeps.\u201d</p><p>Aidan scowled at her. Fancy girls like Marj always thought they\u2019d the right to boss menfolk around. And at ten, he and Cormac were definitely almost men. \u201cYou mean up in the chimney? I\u2019m not climbing your uncle\u2019s stinking chimney.\u201d</p><p>His brother swung around, aiming his sword at Aidan\u2019s chest. \u201cYou\u2019ll not speak so to the lady.\u201d</p><p>Cormac was so much more fun when Marjorie wasn\u2019t around. Aidan wanted to stick out his tongue, but knew it wasn\u2019t something an almost-man would do.</p><p>\u201cThose boys do it,\u201d she said, pointing out the window.</p><p>Aidan shook his head. \u201cYou climb the chimney.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do no such thing.\u201d She pulled her shoulders back, making like she was the Queen of England. \u201cI shall wait here for my rescue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAidan.\u201d Cormac gave him a pleading look. \u201cMum will be back soon. And soon we\u2019ll be gone from Aberdeen, and then it\u2019s back to home. Don\u2019t be so contrary.\u201d</p> <p>Wretched. His brother was in love, and it was wretched.</p><p>He strode to the window. A cartload of chimney boys were filing into the neighboring town house. They were a ragtag bunch, younger than he, covered in soot and tar. It occurred to him how to get Marjie back. \u201cShe\u2019s afraid. I should\u2019ve known a lass would be afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOch, she\u2019s not afraid, Aidan. As I recall, she climbed higher than you last time.\u201d</p><p>Aidan crossed his arms. Of course Cormac would leap to her aid. \u201cThat was a tree, not up into some stinkin\u2019 chimney.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I could\u2019ve gone higher if I\u2019d wanted.\u201d</p><p>Sure she could have. He crossed his arms, looking skeptical.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that I tore my dress last time.\u201d She and Cormac flashed looks at each other.</p><p>Aidan thought he might gag. Rich girls like her always got whatever they wanted, no matter the price. \u201cYour family has enough money to buy you twenty new dresses. Your mum is with our mum right now, buying you even more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave it,\u201d Cormac said. \u201cHer family has money, but not so much that she can go about mussing her gowns.\u201d</p><p>Aidan stared at his brother. Gowns? He\u2019d never heard him talk like that before. It was like Cormac had been taken by a spell.</p><p>\u201cAll right, then. We shall all climb the stinking chimney.\u201d Marjorie tilted her chin up, like they were her unruly servants. Girls like her always thought they were better than everyone. \u201cI dare you. Whoever climbs fastest wins. Unless it\u2019s you boys who are afraid.\u201d</p><p>His fool of a brother bristled. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid.\u201d Cormac went to peer up into the chimney. \u201cI fear nothing.\u201d</p><p>Aidan sneered. Marjie might be able to make Cormac do her bidding, but he\u2019d have no part. \u201cYou climb it, then, if you\u2019re so keen to.\u201d</p><p>His brother climbed onto the grate and stood up. His head and shoulders disappeared from view.</p><p>\u201cCormac!\u201d Marjorie gasped like a maiden in a fairy tale. \u201cYou\u2019re truly going to climb it?\u201d</p><p>One would think Cormac had agreed to slay a dragon. The whole business was foolish. \u201cI\u2019m not climbing it,\u201d Aidan said to nobody in particular.</p><p>\u201cHurry now. We\u2019ve not much time before the sweeps come to Uncle\u2019s house.\u201d Marjorie raced to the hearth. \u201cWhat\u2019s it like in there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSticky!\u201d</p><p>Aidan knew a flash of curiosity. He wished he could go and feel for himself, but his pride prevented him. He balled his fists instead.</p><p>\u201cHere goes.\u201d Cormac jumped, clambering up into the small space.</p><p>Aidan laughed. His brother\u2019s feet were scrabbling in the air, and it made him look like an upended crab.</p><p>\u201cShut your trap, Aid!\u201d Cormac shouted, then he was quiet for a time.</p><p>Aidan stole a glance at Marjorie. She gaped at the chimney like Cormac was off fighting the heathen masses, instead of simply climbing up the godforsaken flue.</p><p>He had to look away. No girl ever looked at him like that. Treacly-eyed stares seemed reserved for his brothers alone. But never for Aidan.</p><p>He shouldered past Marjorie, and went to stare blindly up into the chimney. \u201cYou still in there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMove it, stink-breath. I can\u2019t see.\u201d Cormac scuffed his toes along the sides, sending mortar flying into Aidan\u2019s eyes.</p><p>He scrubbed at his face, and then laughed as an idea struck him. \u201cWhen the chimney boys stop their climbing, the master sweep lights a fire to get them going again.\u201d</p><p>Marjorie pinched him, hard. \u201cYou\u2019ll do no such thing!\u201d</p><p>Aidan stumbled backward. \u201cOw! Criminy, Marj, I was only joking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Marjorie, you beast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the way, Ree,\u201d his brother said. Why did Cormac get to call her stupid nicknames, but Aidan never could?</p><p>\u201cNow stop breathing my air. I think it\u2019s getting smaller up here.\u201d Cormac\u2019s voice was growly, like he was trying to sound the man.</p><p>\u201cYou getting scared?\u201d Aidan taunted.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not getting\u2014oh!\u201d There was a loud scuffling inside the chimney.</p><p>Marjorie shrieked. \u201cThat\u2019s enough, Cormac. You win! Now just come back down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI best get a good prize for this, Ree,\u201d Cormac said, and Aidan wondered what that meant. \u201cI\u2019m getting the way of it now. Like a wee monkey I am.\u201d</p><p>Cormac\u2019s laughter stopped abruptly, and he muttered, \u201cOch, hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOch, hell, what?\u201d Marjorie sounded nervous.</p><p>Aidan eyed her. That\u2019d teach her to tease and taunt boys.</p><p>\u201cYou answer me right now, Cormac MacAlpin,\u201d she said sternly. \u201cOch, hell, what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ... I think I\u2019m stuck.\u201d</p><p>Aidan laughed. His twin wasn\u2019t the conquering hero after all. \u201cYou\u2019ve ate too many pasties from the Aberdeen baker!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not funny,\u201d Marjorie snapped.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m stuck,\u201d Cormac said, and Aidan knew his twin was trying to tell him something. Cormac was much loved, but it was Aidan who seemed always to pry his brother out of jams.</p><p>\u201cAye, I hear you.\u201d He propped the grate onto its side like an impromptu ladder, then stepped back to study it. A thick layer of ash blanketed the fireplace. He\u2019d get filthy, and it\u2019d be his hide tanned for Cormac\u2019s folly. He always pried his twin from jams, but did anyone ever appreciate it? No. \u201cOch, Mar-jorie, could your uncle no\u2019 sweep the bloody hearth?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, resigned. There was nothing for it. His brother was stuck, and of course he\u2019d help him. Aidan climbed onto the grate, using hands and feet to scale it like a ladder. He teetered at the top for a moment, then the whole thing toppled sideways. The metal jabbed into his ribs, and it hurt bad, but he\u2019d never show that to Cormac and Marjorie.</p><p>Instead, he got right back up, propping the grate on its side and climbing again. This time he found his balance. The chimney above was pitch-black, but with the ambient light from below, he could make out the silhouette of Cormac\u2019s dangling feet. \u201cYou get to save Marjorie, but it seems you need me to save you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Aid,\u201d Cormac said, his voice tight.</p><p>Aidan realized how scared his brother really was, and it softened him. Because when all was said and done, he loved Cormac more than anything. More than anyone. \u201cEh, don\u2019t fash yourself over it. Though it does mean you lose the dare.\u201d</p><p>Aidan jumped, swiping at his twin\u2019s foot. He fell again, harder this time. The grate clipped him on his chin, and a cloud of ash exploded into his face.</p><p>\u201cMind the grate!\u201d Marjorie shouted.</p><p>Girls. Aidan shot her a look. \u201cThanks. I hadn\u2019t considered that.\u201d</p><p>What did Cormac see in her anyway? His twin was smitten, and it was making him a fool. And now he was a fool stuck in a chimney. \u201cLosh, Cor, how\u2019d you get up that high?\u201d He coughed, slapping at his clothes. \u201cMy breeches are a wreck. Mum will have my hide.\u201d</p><p>Nobody spoke. Everyone was waiting for him to save the conquering hero. Sighing, he climbed the grate and jumped, and then again. His fingertips grazed Cormac\u2019s feet each time, but he didn\u2019t manage to get purchase.</p><p>Aidan stared up. It was impossible. Cormac was wedged up too high. He could try to climb it, but then he\u2019d have his brother\u2019s feet jammed in his face and likely he\u2019d get stuck too. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He needed something higher to stand on. A chair, mayhap. \u201cMarjorie, what say we bring one of your uncle\u2019s chairs to\u2014\u201d</p><p>Hands grabbed him hard from behind. Thoughts tumbled into his head. Why\u2019d Marj grab me? Losh, the girl is strong.</p><p>But then the smell hit him. A foul, man smell. Man\u2019s hands. Her uncle Humphrey home? We\u2019re in for it now.</p> <p>\u201cStill yerself,\u201d a gruff voice whispered in his ear.</p><p>A servant of Humphrey\u2019s? He held still, waiting for his mother\u2019s voice to chime out in a scold.</p><p>Aidan caught a glimpse of burly, hairy arms. Definitely not a servant.</p><p>A sack was shoved over his head. His heart exploded, and with it his limbs, kicking and flailing.</p><p>Someone was dragging him backward. He heard his brother calling out useless, clueless things, and Aidan tried to yell for him, but the bag only got in his mouth. He spit it from his lips. The air inside was hot and smelled of sour cheese, and it turned his stomach.</p> <p>He hammered his heels against the floorboards, but the man was too strong. Aidan had thought himself almost a man, and this proof of his weakness shamed him, terrified him.</p><p>Marjorie screamed. Were they taking her too? Like her or no, what kind of man would he be if he let that happen?</p><p>He struggled wildly, imagining a miracle, willing it to happen. For once, he wanted Cormac to be the one to save him. Aidan cried out to him, and Cormac shouted back.</p><p>Hearing the panic in his brother\u2019s voice made the moment real. This was really happening. Someone was hauling him away. A quivering sensation jittered through his body. He trembled, his every instinct to act, but he was held powerless in the man\u2019s iron grip.</p><p>Cormac cried out, but his voice was growing faint as Aidan was hoisted from the room. The knowledge that he was in real, dire trouble broke him. No longer did he think of manhood bravado. Aidan screamed for Cormac, over and over, tears flooding his cheeks.</p><p>Marjorie\u2019s shriek pealed from the other room, and as much as she\u2019d annoyed him, a bolt of fear for the girl cut him through. He kicked his foot back, clipping his attacker on the knee, and was answered by a satisfying grunt. He bent his knees to kick again. \u201cTake your hands\u2014\u201d</p> <p>Something clouted him hard on the back of the head and stars exploded inside the black bag. He heard his own whimpers as though from a distance, and then Aidan blacked out.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until hours later that he awoke. There\u2019d been a cold splash of water to his head that left the taste of salt in his mouth. Another splash, and the rocking and creaking of a ship cut him through, his body knowing at once he was far from land.</p><p>The bag was peeled from his face, revealing a man staring at him, smiling. \u201cFancy a sail, boy?\u201d</p><p>Aidan blinked at the sudden brightness. His eyes adjusted, and then all he saw was the glare of gray sea all around, and the glimmer of a black pearl earring in a pirate\u2019s ear.</p><p>Chapter 1</p><p>Stonehaven, Aberdeenshire, 1660</p><p>She wasn\u2019t chilled. Her back didn\u2019t ache. She wasn\u2019t in a barn, nor was she seated upon a three-legged stool. She wasn\u2019t in the milking room, and her cheek was most certainly not nestled deep in the thick, musty wool of a sheep\u2019s haunch.</p><p>No, Elspeth Josephina Farquharson was at a country dance.</p> <p>Well, not truly. But she shut her eyes, dreaming what one might be like. There would be laughter, big jugs of ale, and girls with broad smiles walking arm in arm. The pipes would set into a lively reel. She swayed in time.</p><p>The door creaked open. The room stilled. Footsteps sounded. The heavy step was confident, masculine.</p><p>It was him. He approached from across the room, his eyes only for her. He swept her into his arms.</p><p>The reel began again, and he pulled her, steady as the tides, into the middle of the dance floor.</p><p>His breacan feile wrapped about her legs as he swung her. She gazed up, easy laughter on her lips, staring into his ...</p><p>Elspeth\u2019s hands froze on the sheep\u2019s teat.</p><p>Brown? Emerald green? Gray as a storm-choked sky? Nay, blue.</p><p>She sighed, smiling.</p><p>She gazed up, laughter on her lips, at his blue eyes.</p><p>He had a smile just for her. It was wicked.</p><p>\u201cElspeth, I say. Are you deaf, girl? That sheep\u2019s wrung dry.\u201d</p><p>She sighed again, heavily this time. Her eyes fluttered open. It was her father who stood there, not the dream man.</p><p>\u201cFool girl,\u201d he said, shaking his head, \u201calways in your head. Now come up to the house and put that brain to better use. It\u2019s accounting time, and you know you\u2019re the one with the mind for books.\u201d</p><p>Elspeth scooted back from the sheep, clapping her hands clean. \u201cAye, Father.\u201d</p><p>Even though the family farm was small, she the only child, and her mother long dead, her father needed her. And when he needed her, she always went. How he\u2019d managed before her was a marvel.</p><p>\u201cYou know I don\u2019t have a mind for reckoning.\u201d He gave a loving poke to her temple. \u201cNot like my wee Elspeth.\u201d</p><p>She smiled weakly. The day was coming when she\u2019d need to sit her father down and have a serious talk. He\u2019d sold five head of perfectly good cattle to start a woolen business, without consulting her. And now she was the one left to milk the sheep and mind the accounting.</p><p>But the books told a grim story, and it grew grimmer by the day.</p><p>She worried there might not be enough left to buy back even one cow, if it came to that.</p><p>They returned to their two-room cottage, and Elspeth pulled her chair close to the fire. Candles were dear, and the hearth was the only spot bright enough for reading.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re no lad, but still, how would I survive without you?\u201d</p><p>She looked up, and despite the cut in her father\u2019s words, she found a rare smile on his face. Tenderness seized her heart. Her parents had been long married before they\u2019d been blessed with their only child. When her mother died in childbirth, she\u2019d left her newborn babe with a man old enough to be a grandfather. A man who\u2019d wished for a son but gotten Elspeth instead.</p><p>Her father waited expectantly for a reply. His frizz of gray hair erupted from his head like a halo, or a misshapen bird\u2019s nest.</p><p>No, he couldn\u2019t survive without her. Nor would she want him to.</p><p>\u201cGood thing it shan\u2019t come to that,\u201d she said. The words pricked her, and she forced a smile. She\u2019d spoken the truth: living without her would never be in question. Any dowry there\u2019d been in linens and woolen goods had been sold off long ago. And what coin there\u2019d been for making Elspeth\u2019s plain features more attractive to a prospective husband had gone to the beasts instead.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s your things, then.\u201d He pulled her wee worktable by the fire. It bore a sheaf of papers and her precious quill, and the sight of it automatically switched her mind to the business at hand.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said, already engrossed in her work. She fished out that month\u2019s tally, squinting to focus.</p><p>With a tsk, he rose to stoke the fire higher. \u201cStubborn lass. I wish you\u2019d allow yourself a reading glass. I\u2019ve heard talk of a man in Aberdeen who fashions spectacles. They even have a wee ribbon that holds them to the head.\u201d</p><p>She tilted her chin to bring the numbers into focus, skimming her eyes over the lines. They\u2019d had this argument before. \u201cYou know we haven\u2019t the money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we\u2019ve spent less this month. Or it should read so in that book of yours.\u201d He came and hovered over her, and she shifted so as not to lose the light.</p><p>\u201cHow is that possible?\u201d She scanned the rows, and one number caught her eye. Growing stern, she put her finger to mark her place. \u201cDa, how is it we have more left over this month, and yet we\u2019re making less than ever?\u201d</p><p>She craned her neck to stare a challenge at him. He\u2019d sold personal items off before, and Elspeth wouldn\u2019t put it past him to do something foolish like sell off her mother\u2019s wedding band. She frowned, for it wasn\u2019t as though she\u2019d ever have call to wear anyone\u2019s ring.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve begun to trade. With Angus.\u201d He paused, letting the farmer\u2019s name hang.</p><p>\u201cAngus.\u201d Shaking her head, she looked back down. Her father dreamed of marrying her off to the man. \u201cNot that again.\u201d</p><p>Though Angus Gunn was kind enough, and his neighboring farm profitable, he didn\u2019t make her swoon like all the great heroines swooned. And if Elspeth couldn\u2019t have a great love like those she read about in her novels, then she\u2019d rather skip the whole enterprise entirely.</p><p>Besides, she knew of another woman who\u2019d stolen Angus\u2019s heart long ago.</p><p>Elspeth shut her eyes, pinching the bridge of her nose. \u201cWhat, pray, have we to trade with Angus?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur sheep\u2019s milk for his oats.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes flew open. \u201cRaw oats? However will we mill them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re to feed the sheep.\u201d</p><p>She bit her lips to halt the first words that came to her tongue. She\u2019d simply have to talk to Angus herself. Perhaps arrange to trade for milled oats so they could fill their bellies instead of just the sheep\u2019s. \u201cVery well, Father.\u201d</p><p>There was a knock at the door, and he bolted up, a wide grin on his face. \u201cTalk of him, and he doth appear.\u201d</p><p>Elspeth rolled her eyes. When would her father get it through his thick skull that she neither wanted Angus nor he her?</p><p>The farmer stood in the doorway and gave her father a stoic nod. He was so tall and so broad, he had to hunch to fit. \u201cI put the oats by the barn.\u201d</p><p>He shooed Angus in. \u201cCome in, come in. Say hello to Elspeth.\u201d He swept an arm in her direction. \u201cDoesn\u2019t she look lovely by the firelight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Da,\u201d she muttered under her breath. Little did he know that what men likely saw was a shy spinster, with plain features adorning a too-thin frame.</p><p>Spotting her, Angus slipped his bonnet from his head, crumpling it in his hands. \u201cGood day, Miss Elspeth.\u201d</p><p>She put her papers down and gave him a warm smile. She didn\u2019t have feelings for the farmer\u2014he\u2019d been besotted with her best friend, after all. But that didn\u2019t mean she didn\u2019t think him a kind and dependable soul. \u201cGood day, Angus.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>An awkward silence filled the room.</p><p>\u201cVery good, very good,\u201d her father said, looking from one to the other.</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s all, then.\u201d Angus turned as if to leave.</p> <p>Her father shot her a meaningful, wide-eyed look, nodding encouragement.</p><p>Elspeth shrugged. She\u2019d never been good at idle chat-ter. \u201cDo bide a wee, Angus. We... we\u2019ve just stoked the fire, and I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ve had enough of numbers this day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d Angus went to the corner to retrieve another stool.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the word from town?\u201d her father asked jovially. \u201cI hear the oldest MacAlpin girl has returned a widow. Lost her husband to a war wound, or some such.\u201d He looked to Elspeth. \u201cYou two were mates. What was the lassie\u2019s name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnya?\u201d Was it possible her dearest friend had returned? How strange to hear such tidings, as though Anya had been beckoned by Elspeth\u2019s thoughts alone. Though sadness for Anya\u2019s loss pierced her, she couldn\u2019t help but beam. \u201cAnya MacAlpin is back?\u201d</p> <p>She cut her eyes to Angus, feeling instantly guilty. He\u2019d not weather the news so well. Long ago, Anya\u2019s sud-den marriage had struck him hard.</p><p>Sure enough, he still faced the corner, stool in hand, standing frozen. She was certain Anya was the reason Angus had never married.</p><p>Her smile faded. Would that a man felt half for Elspeth what that farmer must\u2019ve held in his heart for the oldest MacAlpin sister.</p><p>Anya hadn\u2019t wanted to marry a stranger, but her father had given her no choice. The day she watched Anya carted away in tears, Elspeth decided she\u2019d either marry for love, or not at all. And now to think her friend was already a widow, while Elspeth seemed destined to remain forever a maiden.</p><p>Her father seemed baffled by the tense silence, and filled it with mindless chatter. \u201cQuite a year for that family. Cormac\u2014and what a strange, dour fellow he is, aye?\u2014he up and marries the prettiest girl. From Aberdeen proper, she is.\u201d He shook his head, marveling. \u201cAnd now there\u2019s a rumor the brother\u2019s back too. The twin. You remember the lad who was stolen? Aidan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone would soon forget that name,\u201d Angus replied, his features once again a stoic mask. He settled his stool before the fire.</p> <p>Elspeth put her hand to her heart. \u201cYoung Aidan lives?\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t known the MacAlpins when the lad was taken. But like every other villager on the outskirts of Aberdeen, she\u2019d heard about the kidnap. Folk said he\u2019d been mistaken for a poor climbing boy. Everyone had presumed him dead or worse, indentured to a faraway plantation.</p><p>Angus shook his head. \u201cNot so young anymore.\u201d</p><p>The mysterious Aidan popped into her head, a shadowy, featureless silhouette. What came of a man after such an ordeal? And what would he look like? If he\u2019d turned out half as handsome as his twin Cormac, he\u2019d be handsome indeed.</p><p>\u201cAye, he\u2019s returned. But the family is keeping a tight lip about it.\u201d Her father leaned in. \u201cHe was a slave in the tropics, I heard. They say he was branded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBranded,\u201d she gasped. Owned like a common slave. And yet he\u2019d escaped. Bearing secrets, no doubt.</p><p>She shivered, letting her mind wander. How on earth had he made his way back to Scotland, sailing all the way from Jamaica, or Barbados, or Hispaniola? Battling pirates, almost certainly.</p><p>Aidan MacAlpin would be dangerous, swaggering. Just like one of the heroes in her books. Would he speak a foreign tongue? Months on the open seas, his skin would be as smooth and brown as a cowry shell.</p> <p>The sun beat down overhead. The timber planks were hot beneath her bare feet. She stood, gazing across the endless sea. The afternoon was sultry. It loosened her muscles. She felt heavy with the heat. Wanton.</p><p>She sensed him, and turned. He was climbing up the ladder, his virile form rising from the cabin below. His sun-kissed skin glowed with the fine sheen of exertion, accentuating his rippling muscles. He called to his sailors, his voice commanding.</p><p>But then he saw her. Their eyes met, and the rest of the ship fell away. He stalked to her, his very being intent on one thing and one thing alone. Her.</p><p>Elspeth\u2019s breath caught. She put her hands in her lap, wringing her skirts. She hoped the men blamed the flush in her cheeks on the heat of the fire.</p><p>She pretended to listen to her father, all the while enjoying the wicked pattering of her heart, as she let herself imagine.</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>Aidan sat, folded into a too-small chair, situated as close as he could to the door without appearing like he wanted to run. Which he did.</p><p>Home. It was a foreign notion. And Dunnottar Castle, no less. How this cavernous pile of rubble would ever be his home, he had no idea.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t intended to return, at least not until he\u2019d found and avenged himself on the mysterious man who\u2019d stolen him so long ago. But chance had reunited him with his twin brother on a dock in Aberdeen. And just as when they were children, Aidan had found himself enmeshed in one of Cormac\u2019s dramas, but this time of a very dire, very adult sort. In the end, he\u2019d decided to remain with his family, hunting for his enemy from the unlikely hideout that was Dunnottar.</p><p>\u201cFirst you, now Anya,\u201d his sister Bridget said.</p><p>He forced himself into the moment and found her peering at him with a frank stare. It\u2019d do no good to rouse his family\u2019s suspicion, and so he cracked his mouth into what he hoped was a smile.</p><p>Bridget swelled. \u201cOh, Aidan, it\u2019s so wonderful to have you back where you belong. The family together again.\u201d</p><p>A bolt of grief sheared him through. Not the whole family. Just the siblings. Their father had died in the Civil Wars, but that wasn\u2019t the loss he felt keenly. It was their mother whom Aidan mourned.</p><p>Apparently, she\u2019d died the year he\u2019d been kidnapped, and though everyone\u2019s grief appeared to have blunted through the years\u2014indeed, Bridget didn\u2019t even have memories of her\u2014Aidan felt the loss as keenly as if it\u2019d just happened.</p><p>Because, to him, it had. He\u2019d endured his captivity by forcing himself to hold on to memories, even though they cut him sharp as any blade, and thoughts of his mother had been especially acute. He\u2019d while away long nights, recalling her trilling laugh, or how she always smelled of rose water. The way she\u2019d tuck his blanket about his shoulders when she thought he was asleep. He\u2019d dreamed of the day he could sweep her into an embrace. She\u2019d have been shocked at how he\u2019d grown. She\u2019d have been wild with joy.</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t to be. Yet another dashed dream for Aidan, his beautiful mother lying cold in her grave, thirteen years past.</p><p>Anya came in, and he scrubbed a hand over his face to clear his thoughts. She crumpled into a chair, looking bled dry. \u201cThe lad\u2019s asleep.\u201d</p><p>Their brother Gregor reached over and gave her hand a squeeze. \u201cAre you certain you want to share a room with the boy? I assure you, we can clear out another room for him that\u2019d suit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m happy to share. Duncan is my son, after all.\u201d</p><p>Anya mustered a smile for Gregor, and it was the first he\u2019d seen on her face since her arrival.</p><p>It was such a small interaction, but it made him feel more of an outsider than ever. Gregor\u2019s charm had always come naturally\u2014it\u2019d been the same when they were young. It was impossible for Aidan to imagine offering such blithe comfort to any woman, even one of his sisters.</p><p>He scanned the room. All of them, they sat with such ease, huddled close to the fire. It was all he could do not to resent the lot of them. But of course he didn\u2019t. And yet, he couldn\u2019t rise above the pained feeling in his chest when he was in their midst.</p><p>\u201cWhat a fine boy you\u2019ve raised,\u201d Marjorie said. She was nestled close by Cormac\u2019s side.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have your own chance to raise one soon enough.\u201d Smiling, Anya nodded to Marjorie\u2019s belly. It was still flat, even though she was already with child.</p><p>Cormac beamed, and Aidan had to look away. Though Aidan couldn\u2019t begrudge his twin\u2019s happiness, it was a gulf between them. It always had been.</p><p>Only now, after his indenture, it was worse. He couldn\u2019t fathom finding such easy joy with a woman. The only women he\u2019d known had been either pretentious plantation wives, or their hard-used servants. Aidan had found physical release with both. But love? Never that. Never had he been the object of anyone\u2019s care or concern. All he\u2019d ever known was the hard heart, cold eye, and sweaty brow to which the Indies reduced a person.</p><p>Bridget shifted, getting a better view of Anya in the firelight, studying her features. \u201cDuncan\u2019s got your eyes, but that\u2019s it. He must\u2019ve been the very likeness of your husband. It\u2019s a shame you could never visit when he was alive.\u201d</p><p>Aidan watched, mesmerized, as Bridget got up and plopped next to Anya, grabbing her hand and stroking it. \u201cIt seems he was a fine man. You must\u2019ve felt the luckiest of all women to have married such a nobly born gentleman. And a fine soldier, no less.\u201d</p><p>Their older sister only nodded. The amber light accentuated the furrow in her brow. Aidan wondered at the look that flickered in her eyes.</p><p>His eyes went from oldest sister to youngest, as different in appearance as they were in attitude. Anya was thin as a willow and quiet as the breeze, with the lighter coloring of their mother. But Bridget\u2019s eyes were almost as dark as her black hair, and they danced with wickedness.</p><p>Despite himself, Aidan felt a kinship with his older sister. Bridget had been just a babe when he\u2019d been taken, and he found himself discomfited with her bold and buoyant ways.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s so much to catch up on,\u201d Bridget said. \u201cAs it is, it\u2019s nearly impossible to pull stories from Aidan.\u201d She shot him a scolding glance. \u201cSo, Anya, it falls on you. You must tell us your story in full. You must be so proud. Your husband died a war hero!\u201d</p><p>Anya\u2019s mouth was tight. \u201cNot a hero, precisely. Donald died a full ten years after battle.\u201d</p><p>Aidan would wager there was more of a story there that she wasn\u2019t telling. He knew how to read people. Being attuned to the secret wants of others had been key to surviving his long years in captivity. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Bridget tucked her feet beneath her, settling in for a grand tale. \u201cBut from wounds suffered on the field. \u2019Tis no less heroic. Come, tell us the story.\u201d</p><p>There was a moment of stilted quiet.</p><p>Marjorie spoke up. \u201cBridget, love, I fear I\u2019m too tired for tales of war. Cormac, do find the Chaucer for us.\u201d She gave her husband a meaningful glance.</p> <p>Cormac rose dutifully, perusing a small stack of books on the side table. It appeared his twin was still doing Marjorie\u2019s bidding, after all these years.</p><p>Anya shot Marjorie a relieved look. It\u2019d been meant for nobody else\u2019s eyes. But Aidan prided himself on seeing what he wasn\u2019t meant to see.</p><p>Bridget slumped. \u201cNot the Chaucer again. Come now, Anya. Don\u2019t you wish to tell us a story? Just one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just very tired is all,\u201d Anya said. She was a widow at twenty-seven, with a nine-year-old son in her care, who\u2019d recently made the long journey all the way from Argyll, across the length and breadth of Scotland. Aidan imagined she must be tired indeed.</p><p>Gregor spoke up, chiding the youngest sibling with his signature easy smile. \u201cShe said no, Bridget. So stop your badgering. And besides, you forget I was a cavalryman.\u201d He shot Anya a wink. \u201cI\u2019m in no mood to hear captains\u2019 tales.\u201d</p> <p>Aidan gave his older brother a thoughtful look. So Gregor had also noted their sister\u2019s exhaustion. For all that easy charm, Gregor saw what others didn\u2019t expect him to see.</p><p>Declan stumbled in, a book in hand. It seemed his younger brother\u2019s nose was always to be found between the pages.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps Deck can read to us,\u201d Gregor said. \u201cWhat\u2019ve you got today?\u201d</p><p>Declan pointed the cover toward him, even though it\u2019d be impossible to read from that distance. \u201cPeloponnesians.\u201d</p><p>Aidan kept his features smooth. Declan had been too young to fight in the Wars, and he longed for battle. Longed to read about it, talk about it, study it. It was all that he\u2019d talked about in the weeks since Aidan\u2019s return. The boy was clearly touched in the head. If he had any real notion of what it was to face his own death, he\u2019d not carry on so about the whole bloody business.</p><p>\u201cOh no, Declan. No.\u201d Bridget flopped backward with a dramatic flourish. \u201cNot the Greeks again. Cormac, get Sir Gawain down. We haven\u2019t heard that in some time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHere it is.\u201d Cormac pulled a yellowed sheaf of papers bound with a leather thong. He tried to hand it to Bridget.</p><p>She shook her head, her face alight with excitement. \u201cOh, no, not me. I\u2019ve just the idea.\u201d She craned her head, catching Aidan\u2019s eye. \u201cYou read it, Aidan! You do have the best voice of any man in the family.\u201d</p><p>She bestowed regally apologetic nods upon the other brothers. Gregor laughed, Cormac rolled his eyes, and Declan didn\u2019t even seem to notice.</p><p>He stiffened. \u201cNo. I\u2019m not in the mood for reading tonight. Someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruly, Aidan. Your voice is so gruff, and so manly. With your tanned skin, you\u2019re just like a pirate. So dashing! I want to hear you read the part of Sir Gawain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not inclined to read just now.\u201d Not able, more like. He forced the stern line of his mouth into a smile. He\u2019d not let his siblings know his shame.</p><p>\u201cAre you shy? You battled, what, smugglers, pirates, privateers ... marauders! And you won\u2019t read us a wee story?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve no time for this.\u201d Aidan stood, and with a stiff nod to his brothers and sisters, he left the room.</p> <p>He didn\u2019t have time for foolishness like reading. He had one goal. One thing alone drove him. He would hunt down the man who\u2019d ruined his life. He was going to find and kill the man with the pearl earring.</p><p>He sat on the bed he\u2019d set up for himself in the old guardhouse, staring at his papers. He\u2019d stolen them from a slaver, from a smuggler he\u2019d helped Cormac take down. He knew in his heart that somewhere in that stack of parchment, there was some clue as to his enemy\u2019s identity. But the letters and numbers swam before his eyes, all meaningless loops and lines and dots.</p><p>The door opened, and he startled. He quickly shoved the papers under his pillow.</p><p>Anya stood there, hovering like a shadow, her pale skin making her seem a ghost of the girl his sister had been. \u201cYou can\u2019t read, can you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMust you ask me that?\u201d He bristled, bracing for a fight. He wouldn\u2019t admit to anything. Since his return, his family had clothed him, fed him, tended him as though he were a child. \u201cHaven\u2019t I already suffered enough shame?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasy, brother. There\u2019s no shame in it.\u201d She came and sat beside him on the bed, the heather-stuffed mattress crackling with the added weight.</p><p>He barked out a laugh. \u201cNo shame in a grown man not being able to write his own name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m your older sister. Don\u2019t forget it was I who sang you songs, I who kissed your scratched knees. Listen to me when I tell you, it\u2019s not your fault. Your childhood was stolen from you, and your education with it.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t bring his eyes to meet hers, but he sensed her stare, until he felt his face burn.</p><p>\u201cAidan, do you want to learn?\u201d</p><p>He thought about the sheaf of papers hidden under his pillow. How would he ever find his enemy if he couldn\u2019t decipher a simple shipping manifest?</p><p>She sighed, realizing he had no reply. \u201cWell, there\u2019s no reason you shan\u2019t learn. Think on it.\u201d</p><p>She rose, silent as a wraith, but paused at the door. \u201cTell me, Aidan. The sweetest wee horse, carved of wood, mysteriously appeared in my Duncan\u2019s things. It brought a smile to his face, and trust me, there\u2019ve not been many smiles of late. Do you know how it might have appeared? Where it might have come from?\u201d</p><p>He kept his head down, raking his fingers through his hair. \u201cWhat do I know of toys?\u201d</p><p>She was quiet for a moment, then said only, \u201cI thought as much.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t look up until he heard her whispered footsteps leave. He stood and closed the door, leaning his forehead against the cool wood. Learn to read?</p><p>Could he suffer further humiliation before his family? Would he confess his ignorance, doing lessons and exercises more suitable for young Duncan? But he knew, if it meant catching the man with the black pearl, he\u2019d stake his very soul.</p><p>Thoughtful, Aidan dropped onto his bed, kicking back. He pulled a small bundle from his sporran, unsheathed his sgian dubh from where he\u2019d tucked it at his calf. And he began to whittle.</p><p>A bit of wood, taking the shape of a knight.</p><p>Chapter 3</p><p>Elspeth stood before the scarred slab of wood that served as the front door to Dunnottar\u2019s living quarters. A featureless silhouette of the mysterious Aidan MacAlpin had kept her up all night. Would he be wandering the grounds wearing sailors slops for trousers, topped by a half-opened shirt with sleeves like great bells? Had his hair been lightened by the sun? Would he have a roguish twinkle in his eyes? Would they twinkle for her?</p><p>She\u2019d simply had to come see for herself.</p><p>She smoothed her skirts, chiding her silly notions. But then, raising her fist to knock, she made the mistake of sweeping her eyes upward, taking in the cavernous ruins the MacAlpins called home, and she snapped her hand back down. Last time she\u2019d visited, her family had had more money. Her dress hadn\u2019t been quite so threadbare. She, not quite so desperate.</p><p>But it was Anya, she assured herself. Anya wouldn\u2019t care about last year\u2019s dress.</p><p>Mustering her courage, she stepped forward to rap on the door just as it flung open. A man bolted out and knocked right into her. His hands grabbed her upper arms to steady her. She met his eyes, and the breath was stolen from her lungs.</p><p>He was tall, broad, tanned. And as dangerously handsome as any rogue she\u2019d conjured for herself in the past twenty-four hours. His features were masculine, with a strong nose, full mouth, and an unruly thatch of dark brown hair. She stared at his blue eyes, willing them to twinkle.</p><p>Aidan? She opened her mouth to ask, but all that came out was a squeak.</p><p>Straightening his arms, he placed her away from him. \u201cWho are you?\u201d His voice was gruff and as rich as island rum.</p><p>His eyes never strayed from her. \u201cWho are you to enchant me so? I\u2019ve been waiting. For you.\u201d</p><p>She gave a seductive laugh. \u201cYou wicked, wicked man. You know I\u2019ve been here all along.\u201d</p><p>She hiccuped in a breath. \u201cI ... I... I\u2019m\u2014\u201d</p><p>He gave her a puzzled look, then turned, and leaning back inside, shouted, \u201cBridget! Someone\u2019s here for you.\u201d He gave her a brusque nod and stormed from the castle and out of view.</p><p>She swallowed hard, her arms tingling where he\u2019d touched her.</p><p>\u201cI must run.\u201d He reached out, the backs of his fingers trailing down her cheek. \u201cBut I shall return for you.</p><p>Our ship sails at dawn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d Bridget stood in the doorway. Her perplexed expression said Elspeth had been standing there, staring into space, for a few seconds longer than was customary. \u201cOh, it\u2019s just you.\u201d</p><p>Anya appeared behind her sister, her eyes going wide. \u201cElspeth!\u201d She turned and held a bucket out to Bridget. \u201cBe a dear, will you? I was off to fill this, but...\u201d</p><p>Bridget let the implication hang for a moment, and then with a grand huff, took the bucket and edged past both of them out the door.</p><p>Anya stood in the doorway, smiling. But Elspeth saw through the surface cheer to her friend\u2019s exhaustion\u2014in the strain of Anya\u2019s posture, in the faint purplish circles beneath her eyes. And yet, despite it all, Anya was even more ethereally pretty than she\u2019d ever been.</p><p>\u201cAnya,\u201d she said, joining her in an embrace, \u201cyou\u2019re as lovely as you ever were.\u201d</p><p>Anya pulled back, taking in Elspeth\u2019s face. \u201cAnd you.\u201d</p><p>She returned Anya\u2019s smile, accepting the lie for what it was. She knew lovely was a word that would never be used to describe her. But she\u2019d long ago told herself that though she might be plain, she wasn\u2019t decidedly ugly, and that was something indeed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Elspeth held out her arm. \u201cI heard you were back. I thought perhaps you wanted to go on one of our sojourns.\u201d</p><p>As girls, they\u2019d whiled away countless hours on their walks, during which Elspeth would spin tales about ships in the distance, or imagine secret tragedies suffered by passersby. Sometimes she\u2019d pretend they were on a dangerous trek across faraway lands.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been some time since our last expedition,\u201d Anya said, linking elbows. \u201cWhere shall we venture today?\u201d</p> <p>They fell into step easily. Despite the playfulness of Anya\u2019s words, Elspeth heard the strain in her voice.</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d Elspeth tapped a finger on her chin, eager to do what she could to see a true smile on her friend\u2019s face. \u201cExotic Afrique? Perhaps a journey to ancient Carthage? Mayhap,\u201d she added in a wicked whisper, \u201cwe\u2019ll espy a Roman soldier on the road.\u201d</p><p>The errant image of Aidan flashed in her mind. Might they run into him on their walk? And how might he look in Roman helmet and breastplate? With that height and resonant voice, his bearing was decidedly gladiatorial.</p><p>There was a moment of quiet, in which their grins faded to contented smiles.</p><p>Anya patted her arm. \u201cHow I\u2019ve longed to see you.\u201d There was a distinct note of melancholy in her voice.</p> <p>\u201cBut you\u2019ve been the one journeying, in truth. Living all the way in Argyll?\u201d Elspeth squeezed her arm in excitement. \u201cThe trip alone must\u2019ve been a grand adventure.\u201d</p><p>Anya shrugged. \u201cWould that life turned out as we\u2019d imagined as girls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happened to make you feel so decrepit?\u201d Elspeth cocked her head, as though if she looked hard enough, she could read Anya\u2019s story on her face. \u201cI see that you\u2019re tired. I can guess that you\u2019re sad. But the rest ...\u201d She shook her head thoughtfully. \u201cThe rest is a mystery.\u201d Her eyes grew playfully sharp. \u201cPerhaps I\u2019d know if you\u2019d written me more faithfully. Your last letter was over a year ago. Uncommunicativeness is an unforgivable defect in any best friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUncommuni ...\u201d Anya patted her arm. \u201cTruly, Elspeth. Where do you come up with these words?\u201d</p><p>Elspeth steered them onto a path leading down to the shoreline. It was a clear day, and she hoped breathing the salt air might be invigorating for her friend. She might even spare a moment to contemplate swashbuckling, seafaring sorts of men. \u201cYou shan\u2019t change the topic,\u201d she said, as much to Anya as to herself. \u201cAnd don\u2019t tell me it\u2019s because young Duncan\u2014who, by the way, I\u2019m desperate to meet\u2014took too much of your time. Tell me truly how you are.\u201d</p><p>Anya sighed. \u201cYou had the right of it. I am tired. And relieved to be home. My husband was ... a difficult patient.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt must be a hardship, though.\u201d Elspeth stopped in her tracks, staring back up at the ruins of Dunnottar Castle, looming high on the mammoth seaside cliff top known as Dunnottar Rock. It\u2019d been ravaged during the Civil Wars and then abandoned. The MacAlpin siblings had claimed it as their own, and thanks to three\u2014now four\u2014strapping sons, the townsfolk hadn\u2019t the heart to challenge them. \u201cYou always loved finery, Anya. But now, to squat with your family in such a place, not knowing from day to day if someone might come and claim the castle from under you?\u201d She sighed. \u201cWhile your husband\u2019s Stewart estates must\u2019ve been grand indeed. It was always your dream to be a lady of such fortunes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDonald was merely a very distant cousin. But yes, our home was grand. Though, I confess, I find myself preferring it here.\u201d Anya paused, studying the jagged coastline. Veins of rich, green grass fanned down the cliffs toward the beach, a reminder of the tenacious farmland that clung to the eastern coast, refusing to be denied. Something in her eyes cleared. \u201cDon\u2019t you know, dear Elspeth, oak wainscoting and one\u2019s own privy don\u2019t make a home. And besides, Dunnottar has...\u201d</p><p>\u201cA peculiar charm?\u201d</p><p>Brightening, Anya pulled them back into a walk. \u201cAye. Just that.\u201d Loosening her arisaid, she led them to a large flat rock, where she spread the wool out like a blanket. \u201cCome bide a wee. All I\u2019ve done since arriving home is answer questions about my son, and my husband, and my husband\u2019s infirmities, and his military career, and his land holdings.\u201d She sat, growing stoic. \u201cAnd my prospects.\u201d Anya set her shoulders, as though those prospects were something to be borne physically. \u201cI\u2019d hear instead how my bosom friend is faring. So tell me, Elspeth. How fare you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m well.\u201d She shrugged, not much interested in talking about her own exceptionally mundane life. To do so would only be an exercise in fabricating some interesting tale where there was none to be found. It was enough of a strain to maintain a pleasant countenance among acquaintances; she had no wish to create such a charade around her oldest friend.</p><p>Anya pursed her lips. \u201cThat\u2019s all you\u2019ve to tell me? You\u2019re well? We\u2019ve known each other since we were girls hoisting our skirts and climbing to steal apples. I know when you\u2019re not telling me something. Begin with your father. How is he?\u201d</p><p>Elspeth settled onto the rock with a sigh. \u201cI fear Da\u2019s head is still in the clouds.\u201d</p><p>Anya\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cYou\u2019re holding something back, I think. Tell me you\u2019re no longer living your life completely in service to him.\u201d</p> <p>The words cut to her heart, though she feared the truth of them. \u201cMy life\u2019s not so dire as all that.\u201d She forced a smile. \u201cFather began a woolen business.\u201d</p><p>Anya sat next to her. \u201cWell that\u2019s a good thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot when he had to sell off everything in order to do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything?\u201d</p><p>Elspeth knew her friend really meant, Even your dowry? \u201cEverything. Cattle, linens. All of it. For twenty head of sheep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you fancy mutton.\u201d</p><p>It was such a serene rendering of such a preposterous situation, Elspeth had to let free a long, hard laugh. It felt good to find humor in the face of her despair. Dabbing tears from her eyes, she said, \u201cWould that we could enjoy a spot of mutton. My father hasn\u2019t yet grasped the concept of \u2018give us this day our daily bread.\u2019 Do you realize he\u2019s</p><p>trading Angus Gunn for raw oats?\u201d</p><p>Anya froze at mention of the farmer.</p><p>Elspeth\u2019s smile vanished. She grabbed Anya\u2019s hand. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I ... I didn\u2019t think\u2014\u201d</p><p>Anya gave her hand a squeeze. \u201cDon\u2019t fash yourself over it. Now that I\u2019m back, I\u2019ll be hearing his name, and I best get used to it. Go on. Finish your story.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated. She knew there was much Anya wasn\u2019t telling her. She wanted to probe and plumb and speculate\u2014 it was what friends did. But they both had a lifelong habit of avoiding talk of their private pains.</p><p>Elspeth wrung her hands in her skirts. Anya was a widow and a mother. Elspeth\u2019s woes were silly nothings compared to what her friend had endured. She shrugged, and putting a fine point on it, said, \u201cWhat more is there to say? My maddening, stubborn, doddering codger of a father is reducing us to paupers.\u201d</p><p>Anya\u2019s spine bolted straight, her face taking on a look Elspeth didn\u2019t recognize.</p><p>Elspeth stiffened. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need money,\u201d Anya said, her eyes bright.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Elspeth shook her head vehemently, thinking she knew what was coming. She wouldn\u2019t stoop to charity, even if it was from her best friend. \u201cI will not accept\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, goose. I\u2019m not trying to give you money. Well, you\u2019ll make money, but ... you\u2019ll see.\u201d Anya sprang from the rock, looking more animated than she had all morning. \u201cI have an idea.\u201d</p><p>Elspeth laughed weakly, not budging. \u201cYou\u2019re frightening me. You\u2019re not going to propose I sell the sheep in favor of a goat-breeding enterprise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing so coarse as that. You\u2019re a smart woman. The smartest I know. The most well read in and around all Aberdeen, I daresay.\u201d Anya waved her hand for Elspeth to take it.</p><p>Elspeth slid from the rock, taking her friend\u2019s arm. \u201cWhich enables me to what? Write novels? Become an essayist? I\u2019d have a better chance of wedding a mysterious foreign duke and ruling with a velvet glove over ... over the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg.\u201d</p><p>They made their way back to the path, Anya steering them back toward home. \u201cNo, no. Not a writer. You\u2019ll be a teacher.\u201d</p><p>Elspeth pondered for a moment. She supposed Anya\u2019s son would need some tutoring. \u201cBut I\u2019ve not much experience with children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot with children,\u201d Anya chided. \u201cYou shall tutor Aidan.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 4</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking, coming to Dunnottar?\u201d Aidan grabbed his hired man, dragging him by the scruff of his jacket away from the castle grounds. \u201cI told you. Nobody can know what I\u2019m about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I assumed they was your family, sir.\u201d</p><p>He thought of his brothers. They\u2019d just meddle, Gregor and Cormac especially. Finding and vanquishing the man with the black pearl was his secret alone to tend, his revenge to savor. \u201cParticularly not my family. Now, what news have you?\u201d</p><p>Aidan began to head down the steep path to the beach, but saw his sister Anya talking with the strange girl who\u2019d appeared on their doorstep that morning. Turning, he led them north instead. He knew of a secluded cove up the coast where they could shelter from spying eyes.</p><p>Aidan walked quickly, and the hired man stumbled, a city man uneasy on such rugged terrain. \u201cYou were very wise, sir,\u201d the man said, clumsily recovering his step. \u201cWise indeed. It\u2019s just as you said it\u2019d be.\u201d</p><p>Aidan clenched his fists, mustering patience. He slowed his stride. \u201cSpare me the bootlicking and say it plain. What did you learn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and your brother done took down the smuggler.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Aidan said, through gritted teeth. It was an episode he\u2019d not soon forget. Cormac\u2019s sentimental folly had almost killed him. Again. \u201cSo I recall. I\u2019m not paying you to restate the obvious.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou cleared the way, you did. For your own slave trade.\u201d The man looked around, his dim face looking muddled. \u201cBut what do you need with slaves out here? Seems you\u2019d rather put that boat of yours to better use. For fishing, like. Less risky.\u201d The man smiled amiably, revealing a mouthful of decaying teeth.</p><p>\u201cYou overstep.\u201d Aidan fought the urge to clout the fellow. Pretending to start his own slaving trade was a tenuous enough ruse; the last thing he required was the unsolicited counsel of hired dock men. \u201cMy business is precisely that. Mine. Now continue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you nabbed the smuggler, but he weren\u2019t the boss, see. There\u2019s another, a fancy broker type. Him\u2019s who ordered the slaves. And there\u2019s another too\u2014a freebooter like\u2014and him\u2019s your man doing the physical work. Sailing the ship, seeing the bodies to and fro.\u201d</p> <p>The bodies. Aidan had been just such a body. A tenyear-old one.</p><p>He channeled his rage toward the hired man. \u201cSo there are two men outstanding. I don\u2019t suppose it occurred to you to get their names? Or to come bearing any useful information beyond him\u2019s this and him\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>The man opened his mouth and snapped it shut again. He gave a tight shake to his head. \u201cI tried, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought as much.\u201d Aidan dug in his sporran and tossed him a shilling. \u201cA bob for now. A full crown if you</p><p>come back with names.\u201d</p> <p>The hired man\u2019s face twitched.</p><p>Aidan stepped closer to the man in a show of dominance. \u201cIf you\u2019re disappointed with the pay, consider it motivation. To return with actual information. As it stands, this meeting was dangerously close to a waste of my time.\u201d</p><p>The man looked at his feet, dejected. \u201cAs you say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why do you still stand before me?\u201d</p><p>With a nod, his hired man turned and jogged back the way they\u2019d come.</p><p>If he wanted information, he\u2019d just have to go back to Aberdeen himself to look for it. He suspected he held clues already, but damned if he was able to read well enough to find out. It was a complication he needed to remedy, and fast.</p> <p>He couldn\u2019t fail now. He\u2019d been fine-tuning his plan for years: he\u2019d act the part of a wealthy businessman starting his own slave trade and hope he presented competition enough to rouse the man with the pearl earring from whatever rock he hid beneath.</p><p>Him, a slaver. The thought was absurd. But lies spilled easily enough from his lips. He wondered grimly, who was Aidan really? His true identity had been stolen from him thirteen years past. If anything, Aidan was the thing that felt foreign. He\u2019d spent his childhood simply called \u201cboy,\u201d and then, when his body far surpassed what one could reasonably consider a boy, that\u2019d evolved into \u201cScot.\u201d He\u2019d been pretending ever since, the past thirteen years naught but lies and half-truths.</p><p>The first of his many lies had been to his purported master. The man\u2014Nash was his name\u2014had been a simpleton. His was an old Barbadian family, what islanders referred to as \u201cBims.\u201d A few years older than Aidan, Nash had been born into a plantation fortune. \u201cSweet</p><p>money,\u201d he\u2019d call it, his \u201csweet sugar money. White gold.\u201d</p><p>Amassed from the labors of stolen souls.</p><p>Aidan sneered, remembering. It\u2019d been simple enough, ingratiating himself with the man. Nash had been eager to speak of Mother Country, and Aidan had dredged as many of his father\u2019s war stories from his memory as he could. His master had lapped up every word, like a starved and stupid pup.</p><p>And then he simply bided his time, slowly working out his plan, dreaming of escape. For years, he waited.</p><p>Until one day he realized how much his half-wit mas-ter had grown to trust him. When he learned Nash was planning a sail to Aberdeen, it didn\u2019t take long to convince him that Aidan could be trusted as part of the crew.</p> <p>A few favors, some thrown fists, and several promises later, Aidan found himself captaining a pretty sloop and her three crewmen out of Bajan Harbor, with the imbecile Nash left hog-tied at the dock. As the idyllic crescent of white sand faded into gray sea, the swell of freedom in his chest had been sweeter than any sugarcane.</p><p>And then came Aidan\u2019s second lie, to his crew: that his sole purpose was to make his fortune in the slave trade.</p><p>He\u2019d regretted the telling of it, but there was no other choice. He had one goal, and one goal only. Not friendship, nor camaraderie. It was to track, to find, and to kill the man who\u2019d abducted him. To do so, he needed to infiltrate the smuggling network.</p><p>It would be an impossible task, tracking down the ghost who\u2019d haunted him all these years. But revenge was all Aidan wanted, vengeance all he was.</p><p>He\u2019d hide out in Dunnottar, using spies, coin, and his own wits and muscle to guide him. He had only two clues to his enemy\u2019s identity. Knowing the man had been in Aberdeen, thirteen long years ago. And a single black pearl.</p><p>The hunt was on.</p><p>The hunt was off\u2014if every soul in Aberdeenshire knew what he was about.</p><p>\u201cI told you, told all of you, to keep my identity close.\u201d Aidan shifted his glare from Anya to Elspeth. He was seated at the great slab of wood that was the dining table, simmering with rage. \u201cAnd now you go and bring this stranger into our home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cElspeth is no stranger.\u201d Anya kept her chin held high. \u201cI trust her more than I trust my own ... my own ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour own sister?\u201d Aidan rolled his eyes, his temper abating. \u201cThat girl Bridget has trilled about my homecoming to whoever might chance to look her way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat girl Bridget is your sister. And we\u2019ve told her she needs to be more ... circumspect. But I still don\u2019t understand why. Are you in trouble? Are you in hiding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He tossed back the last of a tankard of ale. He wasn\u2019t hiding\u2014he just didn\u2019t want folk to uncover the truth of his goals. He studied Anya\u2019s friend, doubtful this mouse of a girl would be able to help him. He glared at her, to make his meaning clear. \u201cI don\u2019t wish every villager from here to Aberdeen to hear about my return.\u201d</p><p>\u201cElspeth will keep your secret,\u201d Anya told him in a calming voice. \u201cThe MacAlpins lost you once. We\u2019ll not lose you again. Until you decide to tell us why you insist on such secrecy, we shall all respect your wishes.\u201d</p><p>Elspeth nodded. Nobody knew better than she how to keep a secret. She had no doubt he had a good one too. She was certain Aidan was embroiled in some private scheme. A thrilling plot, involving mystery and intrigue.</p><p>Aidan was furious, and she secretly rejoiced. Because he wasn\u2019t angry at the thought of reading, or her, or of reading with her. It was simply that he wished to be discreet. Clearly, he only wanted to keep his identity a secret so as not to bring danger upon his family. Or to the friends of his family. That meant her. Ergo, he wanted to keep her safe too. She shivered.</p><p>He tore a hunk from a loaf of bread and pinned her with that blue gaze. \u201cYou\u2019ll keep your mouth shut, aye?\u201d</p><p>Elspeth\u2019s voice was breathy when she replied, \u201cI shall be the very picture of obsession.\u201d She blanched. \u201cDiscretion. I... I ... I shall be the very picture of discretion.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a peculiar look. Her heart pounded, and she was certain it was pumping twenty shades of red into her cheeks.</p><p>She assured herself it could\u2019ve been worse. She might have accidentally misspoken something more embarrassing. Possession, for instance, or affection. Or, God for-fend, erection.</p><p>The thought made her squeak.</p><p>Not taking his eyes from Elspeth, Aidan posed a question to his sister. \u201cYou\u2019re certain this chit has the wits to teach me?\u201d</p><p>His tone broke her spell. \u201cIndeed,\u201d both women said in unison.</p><p>Anya was bristling. \u201cElspeth is the smartest girl you\u2019ll ever meet. She knows Latin and French.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just need English,\u201d he said over a mouthful of bread.</p><p>Elspeth watched, hypnotized, as he swept crumbs from the table into his hand, and then popped them in his mouth.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s quite proficient in that as well,\u201d Anya said. \u201cShe even does her father\u2019s accounting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s more a comment on her father than on her.\u201d He looked at her, speculating. \u201cTell me, girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer name is Elspeth.\u201d Anya\u2019s tone was steady and calm.</p><p>\u201cTell me, Elspeth. Are you to speak to me when you teach, or will my sister have to translate?\u201d A smile, a true smile, cracked his face.</p><p>The sight of it made Elspeth\u2019s heart soar. She spoke slowly and carefully in her response. Just in case. \u201cIndeed, sir. I am perfectly capable of speaking for myself.\u201d</p><p>Aidan tilted his face, considering her. Never before had a man considered her like that. Never had one so handsome ever so much as looked her way.</p><p>Her chest tightened, and she forced it to rise and fall. No good came of fainting from lack of breath.</p><p>Anya cleared her throat. \u201cIt\u2019s settled, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s settled.\u201d His eyes were hooded and intense, and Elspeth thought he might just be able to see through her clear into the next room. \u201cShe can begin our lessons tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 5</p><p>Elspeth stood in the doorway on the following day, mustering her courage. Aidan was sitting alone at the dining table. He hadn\u2019t yet realized she was there, and she seized the opportunity to study him, letting her eyes roam his broad shoulders, that roguish tangle of hair.</p><p>Something held his attention. She angled her head to see. It was a scrap of paper.</p><p>Her heart fell. Was he reading? Her services wouldn\u2019t be needed after all.</p><p>But then she saw how his eyes flicked to and fro, rather than scanning as though reading lines on a page. A smile spread on her face, wide, like he\u2019d just paid her a compliment rather than simply offer proof of his illiteracy.</p><p>She lifted a foot to walk, then put it back down again, wondering how to approach him, what to say. Good day, Master MacAlpin. Good morning. Hello, Aidan. Or perhaps she should simply clear her throat.</p><p>In the end, she blurted, \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He startled, shoving the paper into his sporran. \u201cYou. How long have you been standing there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ... I ... just a moment.\u201d</p><p>He touched a finger to his ear. \u201cWhat? Girl, you\u2019re as quiet as the grave.\u201d He looked around the room as though there might be other spinsters hidden about. \u201cWhat are you doing anyway, lurking around? Come in here.\u201d He scanned the length of her. \u201cI daresay, you\u2019d make a tidy wee spy.\u201d</p> <p>His tone and his gaze had been suspicious, but secretly she rejoiced. Her. A spy. She could be one, she knew it.</p><p>But what did one say to such a statement? It wasn\u2019t exactly a compliment. She walked to him, forcing one foot in front of the other, willing herself not to trip. She could be worldly. She could be mysterious. She formulated a sophisticated reply in her head.</p><p>And then she tripped.</p><p>Quickly, she set her skirts to rights, glaring hard at the ground as if it were to blame for her clumsiness. Maddening tears stung her eyes, and she blinked hard, refusing to let embarrassment get the better of her.</p><p>This was about her father\u2019s debts, not mooning over Aidan MacAlpin.</p> <p>Stiffening her mouth, she risked a glance at her so-called student. She\u2019d borne men\u2019s scorn before and expected she\u2019d find no different with Aidan. But rather than a smothered laugh on his lips, or disdain, he studied her from beneath a furrowed brow.</p><p>\u201cCome on, then,\u201d he said, with unexpected gentleness. He scooted over on the bench, making room for her. \u201cSit just here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she managed. Other men might have mocked her, but not him. Even if she never saw Aidan again, she knew she\u2019d be forever grateful for that single, small kindness.</p><p>She settled next to him, pretending she didn\u2019t feel the heat of his body like an open flame along her side. With a sharp inhale, she focused, shuffling her papers, setting up quill and inkpot for their first lesson. \u201cI thought we\u2019d begin with a simple reading.\u201d Each word tripped over the other as she spoke.</p><p>There. That was simple enough. She could do this.</p><p>\u201cAs you say.\u201d He shifted closer, reaching for the small bound book she\u2019d brought to use as a primer. He riffled through the pages. \u201cIs this what you\u2019ll teach me to read?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s common for\u201d\u2014she paused, wanting to choose her words carefully so as not to offend. Students? Readers? Learners?\u2014\u201cp-people to begin by reading The Book of Common Prayer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t sign on for sermons, luvvie.\u201d</p><p>She girded herself to look at him, but his relaxed smile told her he wasn\u2019t angry. \u201cNor I.\u201d She managed a smile, which seemed to broaden his. \u201cIt\u2019s the most ... the best ... it\u2019s a good book for this sort of endeavor.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d meant, it was easy. Simple, with repetitive words.</p><p>She\u2019d actually fantasized about the other books she might bring, entertaining sinful thoughts of him reading aloud from her translation of Boccaccio\u2019s Decameron. Or, better yet, to hear his rich voice pitched low, reciting from her collection of sonnets.</p><p>He swung his leg to straddle the bench. Hitching his hips closer, he cupped the side of her face. He leaned close and whispered, \u201c \u2018Shall I compare thee to a summer\u2019s day?\u2019 \u201d</p><p>Her skin shivered to gooseflesh.</p><p>\u201cDo you need the fire?\u201d</p> <p>She clicked to. \u201cThe fire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, you seem cold.\u201d He was giving her a quizzical look.</p><p>\u201cCold?\u201d</p><p>Aidan inhaled deeply. \u201cI don\u2019t ken much about tutoring, luvvie, but I do have enough sense to know this would get on more easily if you didn\u2019t repeat my every last word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d She felt silly. Why could she not focus? She was the most focused person she knew.</p><p>He gave her an awkward pat on her shoulder. \u201cDon\u2019t worry yourself over it.\u201d</p><p>He was trying to make her feel better. This piratical rogue of a man was trying to make her feel better, and it only made Elspeth feel more the fool.</p><p>Aidan took the prayer book from her hands. \u201cI need letters and numbers enough to read, say, a simple ship\u2019s manifest. And you say this will help?\u201d</p><p>It sounded as though he had some very specific reading materials in mind. It piqued her curiosity. \u201cWas that what you were looking at? A ship\u2019s manifest?\u201d</p><p>He considered her for a moment, then said, \u201cOf sorts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMight I see it?\u201d</p><p>His face was like stone staring at her.</p><p>She mustered her courage, her curiosity now exceeding any uneasiness. \u201cThat\u2019s the only way I can get an idea. Of what I need to teach you.\u201d</p><p>Another few seconds passed before he finally gave a sharp nod. Reaching into his sporran, he retrieved a small sheaf of papers. He flipped through, hesitating over what to show her.</p><p>She craned her neck, trying to get a peek. Were these his papers? Maybe he really was a pirate, with a grand ship docked in a hidden cove.</p><p>He caught her snooping. and looking annoyed, he selected one sheet and folded the rest. \u201cI think mayhap you really are a spy.\u201d</p><p>She felt a blush spread to the roots of her hair.</p><p>\u201cAll right, then,\u201d he said, tilting it toward her. The name of a ship was written at the top, followed by a list of</p><p>crewmen. It didn\u2019t enlighten her one little bit.</p><p>\u201cYou want to read that?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWell ... mayhap.\u201d He sounded uncertain. \u201cIt\u2019s just a list of names.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure if he\u2019d spoken a question or a statement. Did he truly not read well enough to discern Christian names on a roster? She decided some early praise might go far. \u201cYes, very good. That\u2019s precisely what that is. A list of crew members. Let\u2019s begin today\u2019s work on letters and sounds, and that will help you work out the exact names.\u201d</p><p>Though she couldn\u2019t imagine why he\u2019d need such a thing. Was he in trouble? Running from somebody?</p><p>She reached for the list, but he gave a shake to his head and returned it to his sporran. \u201cNot yet. We\u2019ll start with all that.\u201d He nodded to the materials she\u2019d brought.</p><p>He seemed so serious. She thought he might indeed be in some sort of danger.</p><p>\u201cI ... Of course. First we\u2019ll work on letters, and we can read later.\u201d She extracted a fresh sheet of paper and slid it toward him.</p><p>He gave her a blank look in response.</p><p>\u201cDo you know any letters?\u201d She cringed at how the question had come out. His mouth was set in a tight line, and she cursed her thoughtlessness. \u201cNever mind that,\u201d she said quickly. \u201cI think I should be the one to start.\u201d</p><p>She gasped a nervous laugh, riffling her papers with shaking hands. What would she mess up next? \u201cYou must forgive me, Master Aidan. I\u2019ve never done this before, and I\u2019m afraid you\u2019re the one forced to suffer my inexperience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot \u2018Master Aidan.\u2019 \u201d His voice was deep and commanding. A pirate\u2019s voice.</p><p>She froze. Curse her heart, fluttering away like the wings of a bird, and for what reason? He\u2019d said a simple phrase, and her body reacted as though girding herself for her theatrical debut. \u201cI ... I beg your pardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy name. It\u2019s Aidan. I\u2019ve had a master in my life, and believe me, luvvie, I\u2019ll die before I\u2019m referred to as one. Call me simply Aidan.\u201d</p><p>She looked blindly at her papers, unable to meet his eye. \u201cAidan, then.\u201d</p><p>Her voice was quiet, her pale cheeks flushed red, and Aidan marveled at what a peculiar bird she was. He\u2019d never met her like.</p><p>He watched her quivering hands as she withdrew a blank sheet from her stack. Her discomfort was beginning to unsettle him, and he wondered if the tightness he felt in his chest was annoyance or concern. He fought the urge to capture that hand, pinning it till she stilled.</p><p>She began a neat row of letters, saying the name of each as she wrote, and even her voice seemed to quaver. Her every aspect was like a lone flower in the midst of a windstorm.</p><p>Why was she so nervous? He inspected her profile as though he could read the truth if only he searched hard enough.</p><p>Perhaps she was cold, but too shy to ask for a fire. He let his eyes roam her figure. She was certainly a willowy wisp of a creature, her trembling only making her seem all the more insubstantial. She hadn\u2019t an ounce of flesh to spare, and he wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she spent half her life chilled to the bone.</p><p>She remained focused on her work, and so he let his eyes linger. She raised an arm to her ink jar, and with a shock to his loins, he realized that perhaps this Elspeth did indeed have an ounce or two of flesh to spare. Her breasts were modest, but lovely and well formed, a pair of treasures hidden beneath her layers. He had to shift in his seat to adjust himself, spying that, yes indeed, the woman was cold. Her pert nipples formed two faint shadows along the front of her bodice.</p><p>Just who was she? She seemed so nervous, reciting her letters. What might she be hiding that he wasn\u2019t seeing, and more importantly, what would he have to do to find out? Because, oddly, he found he wanted to know. There\u2019d been many women in his life, and never had one held any mystery for him.</p><p>Most importantly, he needed to discern if she could be trusted as much as his sister had promised. He decided he needed to test matters. See if he could get a rise out of her. If she had deceitful intentions, he\u2019d uncover them.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to whisper on my account,\u201d he said, pitching his voice and curling his mouth in a way that\u2019d gotten a perfect rise out of dozens of women before her. \u201cYou have a fine voice.\u201d</p><p>Her hand hung in midair. Slowly she raised her head to him, her eyes gaping wide as a fish\u2019s. He bit his cheek not to laugh at the sight.</p><p>The girl was innocent as an angel, or he wasn\u2019t the devil\u2019s own. She clearly hadn\u2019t an ounce of deceit in her. It was as Anya had said\u2014Elspeth would be discreet about their meetings and his identity. So what, then, was the source of her discomfort? And who was she to be so book-learned?</p><p>At first sight, he\u2019d assumed she was just another of the mindless, entitled lassies as plentiful in Aberdeen as cured fish. But now he suspected she wasn\u2019t so easily pegged. She\u2019d been reduced to tutoring for pay, after all. And that was in addition to work she did for her father. He\u2019d gathered she didn\u2019t have siblings either. The girl seemed to have even less support than she did prospects. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>By reflex, he gave her one of his smiles, though his mind was racing. \u201cGo on. I didn\u2019t mean to interrupt.\u201d</p><p>Elspeth lowered her face back to the page, looking rattled. It was almost as though she didn\u2019t realize how fine she was. Not that she was pretty. Not exactly.</p><p>He stared hard, taking the opportunity to graze every inch. She was, on the face of it, quite plain. Especially when compared to a rosy-cheeked spitfire like Bridget, or the walking grace that was their eldest sister, Anya.</p> <p>But Elspeth was unassuming and gentle, and those were qualities he hadn\u2019t encountered in... perhaps ever.</p><p>He watched her mouth form each letter. When she concentrated on the page, she looked relaxed. Books appeared her element, putting her at her ease, and oddly that pleased him.</p><p>He studied her lips. They were neither thin nor thick. In fact, there was nothing about her that stood out. Nothing too grossly large, nothing too unusually small.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t unappealing, he decided, which made it surprising that she hadn\u2019t yet married, for she wasn\u2019t a young maid. Rather, she was Anya\u2019s age, and his widowed sister already had a half-grown son.</p><p>He wondered why Elspeth might not be considered pretty. What alchemy made one girl stand out from the rest?</p> <p>Not that he cared for pretty. He knew the saying handsome is that handsome does, and he\u2019d found it borne true in his own experience, time and again. How many plantation women had he seen, with skin like cream and eyes like jewels, wielding their whips so very prettily? It\u2019d been up to the men to discipline the adults, but children had been the women\u2019s domain, and after a beating, a plantation wife\u2019s pretend remorse was very pretty indeed.</p><p>He knew because he\u2019d been one of those children. He had the jagged scars on his back to prove it.</p><p>\u201cAnd zed,\u201d Elspeth said, writing out a perfect Z. She\u2019d finished the alphabet and now held the quill out to him. \u201cNow it\u2019s your turn.\u201d</p><p>He swallowed hard. Scythe, plow, shears, hoe, shovel,</p><p>rake, sword, dagger... These were all tools he\u2019d held in his life. But a quill? Last time he\u2019d held a quill, he\u2019d been a ten-year-old studying at the kirk schoolhouse with the other children.</p><p>But he had no choice. If he was going to present himself as a wealthy lord, he needed to know how to read. How to sign his cursed name. And so, like a child, he had to learn the basics.</p> <p>But it didn\u2019t mean he didn\u2019t hate it, and hate himself for his ignorance.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d he said, grabbing the quill from her. It felt so tiny in his hand, his fingers so awkward and thick. It was his hand that trembled now, and he pressed it onto the table to anchor himself. He slammed his other hand onto a blank page and slid it under the tip of the pen.</p><p>She nudged the inkpot toward him. \u201cDon\u2019t forget, you must dip it first.\u201d</p><p>Of course. He\u2019d known that. With a tight nod, he dipped his quill then brought it to the paper. He pressed too hard, and ink bled from the tip, forming a sloppy puddle.</p><p>\u201cHang it,\u201d he muttered. His life was black luck, a black soul, and now worthless black blots of ink. He moved to crumple the ruined page.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d She touched his hand, and they both grew still.</p><p>He tilted his head to catch her eye. She looked nervous. He wanted her to stop looking so damnably nervous. He wasn\u2019t that terrifying. She hadn\u2019t even seen his scars yet. He raised his brows impatiently, waiting for instruction.</p><p>\u201cYou mustn\u2019t stab it. Hold it sideways.\u201d</p> <p>Her voice was gentle, and it calmed him. Not a wee spy, he thought, perhaps a trainer of wild creatures. He did as she\u2019d told him, and tilted his hand.</p><p>\u201cYes. That\u2019s the way.\u201d He heard the smile in her voice, and a foreign feeling of warmth flickered deep in his icy heart. \u201cNow write your first letter. A, for \u2018Aidan.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>He began the letter, but pressed too hard, and the quill squeaked along the parchment. His muscles flinched, ready to crumple the sheet and quit this nonsense. He couldn\u2019t form a simple, childish letter, and it shamed him. But then he felt the barest touch on his forearm.</p><p>\u201cLightly,\u201d she urged. \u201cYou\u2019re too strong.\u201d</p><p>Too strong. Like a brute was too strong, or an ox. He looked up, a quip ready on his lips, but saw she\u2019d turned nearly purple with embarrassment. Something about her words had made her self-conscious. Such a fascinating, peculiar bird of a girl.</p><p>His own shame vanished, and he brought his attention back to the paper. \u201cLike this?\u201d he asked, wanting to put her at her ease.</p><p>\u201cYes, but don\u2019t press down. Just touch it lightly. A gentle touch for each stroke is what you need.\u201d</p><p>His mind went to a place decidedly more sexual than this bit of book learning warranted, and he suppressed a smile, keeping himself intent on the paper before him.</p><p>Elspeth mistook his silence for confusion. \u201cPerhaps if you held it thusly.\u201d She brought her hand to his to adjust his fingers on the quill, her movements as tentative as a frightened cat.</p><p>He\u2019d have thought her hands would be clammy, but they were warm, their touch soft and light. He felt a bolt of lightning shoot up his spine. A gentle touch from an innocent was something far outside the realm of his experience. He relaxed his hand, letting her mold his grip, savoring the feel of those delicate fingers on his.</p><p>As she positioned his hand, he attuned himself to her utterly. Her breaths came evenly, and he imagined he felt each brush against his skin. The barest scent wafted up to him. Nothing like his mother\u2019s rose water, nor the cloying ambergris of elegant plantation wives. Elspeth smelled sweet and fresh, like freshly turned earth and grass.</p><p>Her long, thin fingers mesmerized him, so pale against his tanned and callused skin. He dared not look higher than her wrist, a peek of it visible at the cuff of her sleeve. She was so fragile, with bones like a graceful seabird.</p><p>He imagined she\u2019d never touched a man so. Perhaps it meant she was no longer nervous. Perhaps he had put her at her ease.</p><p>He needed to say something to fill the quiet, but he found he was speechless. He, whose blithe words had seduced some of the most exotic women in the world, found himself at a loss.</p><p>She sat so close to him, and yet he couldn\u2019t picture her eyes. What color were they? He thought they were blue, but what else would he see there? Flecks of green? Of violet? He needed to find out. He risked a glance, caught her gaze.</p><p>And saw terror there.</p><p>Anger swamped him, sudden and blinding. This Elspeth was as skittish as a calf surrounded by a pack of wolves.</p><p>He knew he was different from other men. He knew he didn\u2019t belong. But was he so coarse? Was he such a threat?</p><p>Aidan snatched his hand away. \u201cWe\u2019re done here.\u201d</p><p>He stormed from the room and didn\u2019t look back.</p><p>Chapter 6</p><p>Wrenching her body upright, Elspeth arched back to ease the knot at the base of her spine. She\u2019d hauled bucket after bucket of Angus\u2019s raw oats to feed the sheep, and the labor was beginning to take its toll.</p><p>She let herself take a moment. Despite the frustration over her father\u2019s lack of business sense, despite the dirt that seemed forever to cling at her skirts and beneath her nails, she found tending the sheep to be a more pleasant chore than she\u2019d have believed. At least as pleasant as minding their few cattle had been, and some bit easier too. They were serene creatures, and more social than the cows, butting their heads against her legs for attention, vying for handfuls of grain.</p><p>She dusted off then grew thoughtful, contemplating her hands, rubbing them, wiping the dirt from her palms. And remembering.</p><p>She\u2019d touched him with those fingers.</p><p>Never had she touched a man\u2019s hand before. Never had she touched a man, period. At least one who wasn\u2019t her father.</p><p>It had only taken a moment to adjust Aidan\u2019s fingers on the quill, but still she\u2019d lingered, lost to thoughts of what those hands might have seen. They\u2019d likely harvested sugarcane, and climbed ship\u2019s rigging. But had they also punched men? Touched women? Touched himself?</p><p>A sultry warmth bloomed in her belly, and she glanced side to side, to ensure that nobody was there to witness such wicked musings.</p><p>Sure enough, Anya was at the top of the hill, walking down to the glen where they kept the sheep penned.</p><p>Elspeth shook out her skirts, gathering herself. With one last rub of her hands, she cleared her mind of these stolen dreams as surely as the dust from her fingers. Then she smiled, happy with any interruption if it meant seeing her friend. Especially now. Even though Anya bore no resemblance to Aidan, Elspeth felt somehow closer to him for sight of his sister.</p><p>\u201cWhat brings you\u2014oh!\u201d Elspeth chirped at the sight of the young boy who raced from behind Anya. She\u2019d brought Duncan. \u201cIt\u2019s your boy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d Anya said, returning her smile. \u201cIf he\u2019d be still for but a moment, I\u2019d introduce you.\u201d</p><p>But apparently nine-year-olds didn\u2019t stand on ceremony, because Duncan simply raced up to Elspeth and, skidding to a halt, asked, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>Elspeth couldn\u2019t help but laugh at his intensity. With freckled cheeks panting for breath and bangs that\u2019d turned reddish brown with sweat, the boy looked nothing like Anya.</p><p>\u201cWhy, I\u2019m feeding the sheep, naturally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are their names?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTheir names.\u201d She put her hands on her hips, con sidering. \u201cLet\u2019s see. Why there\u2019s Juliet, and Imogen, and Miranda is just there ...\u201d</p><p>Elspeth conjured a name for every last one, Duncan hanging on her every word. He frowned when she\u2019d finished. \u201cDon\u2019t you have no boy sheeps?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t we have any male sheep?\u201d she repeated, gently correcting his grammar. She sighed. Didn\u2019t they indeed. Her father hadn\u2019t thought so far as to purchase them a godforsaken ram, so set he\u2019d been on the prospect of milk, cheese, and wool. \u201cWhy no. They\u2019re spinsters, every last one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDuncan, a bhobain!\u201d Anya cried in a breathless gasp.</p><p>But Elspeth only laughed. Nobody knew better than she about her marital status. \u201cOh, it\u2019s fine, Anya, really.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Duncan put his hands on his hips, looking defiant. \u201cWell, that\u2019s what Auntie Bridge called her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell your aunt Bridget best mind her tongue.\u201d</p><p>One of the sheep bleated, calling Duncan\u2019s attention back to the flock. He tore a handful of grass and tried to feed it. \u201cWill they never marry?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe sheep?\u201d Elspeth tilted her head, considering. \u201cWhy, I think not, actually. Particularly not the one you\u2019re feeding. That one\u2019s Artemis. She\u2019s very wise, and brave too. And she\u2019s chosen not to marry just any silly old ram who ambles into her pasture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t she get lonely?\u201d</p><p>She tapped her finger on her mouth in exaggerated contemplation. \u201cI suppose she does. Sometimes. But she has her oats to occupy her. And she enjoys meeting new people, like you.\u201d The sheep nudged Duncan\u2019s hip, smelling the remnants of what she imagined were probably crumbs from a bit of food he\u2019d hidden in his pocket. \u201cBut this way, Artemis has the freedom to graze where she likes. Wander where she likes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes she wander? What if she doesn\u2019t come back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a risk, isn\u2019t it? She\u2019s not wandered off yet. Though I suppose one never knows.\u201d Elspeth smiled widely, and looked at her friend to share in the moment.</p> <p>Her smile froze. Anya\u2019s gaze was restless, scanning the horizon from beneath a furrowed brow.</p><p>\u201cDuncan, would you please do me a favor and get one last bucket of oats from the feed shed?\u201d Elspeth pointed across the glen. \u201cIt\u2019s just over there, near the cottage. Don\u2019t you know, if you feed a sheep from your very own hand, you\u2019ll have a friend for life.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cOh, aye, straightaway,\u201d he said, and raced off.</p><p>Anya was looking uneasily at the trough, now empty of oats. \u201cWere those from ...\u201d</p><p>Elspeth knew her friend was nervous at the prospect of running into the neighboring farmer. \u201cAye, we get our feed from Angus\u2019s farm. But don\u2019t fret.\u201d Stepping closer, she put a soothing hand on Anya\u2019s sleeve. \u201cHe\u2019s nowhere about. The man works harder than a plow horse. Rare is the sight of him setting foot off his own lands.\u201d</p><p>Though Anya sighed and nodded, she still appeared upset.</p> <p>\u201cBut whatever is the matter?\u201d Elspeth asked. \u201cYou mustn\u2019t hold back. I can see the trouble on your face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Elspeth. I have horrible news.\u201d Anya wrung her hands in front of her.</p><p>Elspeth\u2019s stomach heaved. Had Aidan left? Had he said something terrible about her? He\u2019d stormed off after their lesson. Did he say he never wished to see her again? She waited mutely for Anya to explain.</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t the money to pay you,\u201d Anya confessed. \u201cAidan, when he arrived ... I found... please don\u2019t believe me to be rifling through my brother\u2019s effects, but I saw he had a pouch full of gold coins. I\u2019d just assumed ... all that time sailing about ... perhaps I\u2019ve spent too much time with you!\u201d She gave a dismissive, self-deprecating laugh. \u201cI suppose I\u2019d assumed that, on his flight from the Indies, he\u2019d absconded with a chest of treasure. But he tells me that single pouch is all he owns in this world, and so it turns out we haven\u2019t the money to pay you after all.\u201d</p><p>Anya put a fretful hand to her temple, continuing, \u201cI get the impression Gregor has some funds tucked away, but my maddening brother is being uncharacteristically miserly. I suspect he\u2019s waiting to see what Aidan\u2019s truly about, to see if he decides to stay on with the family. So there you have it,\u201d she finished in a rush. \u201cWe require your services and yet find ourselves unable to pay.\u201d</p><p>Elspeth\u2019s shoulders sagged with relief. But a queasy anxiety was quick on its heels. She and her father needed the money. Very much so. And yet, foolishly, she couldn\u2019t bring herself to mind. The only thing she could think was that she must continue to see Aidan, and she\u2019d just have to figure out another way to fill her father\u2019s and her belly, even if it meant opening her own schoolhouse. \u201cDon\u2019t fret over the money. I know your family needs me, and I\u2019ll not quit you.\u201d I\u2019ll not quit him.</p><p>\u201cBut I can\u2019t allow you to do so much for us, when we have nothing to offer in return\u201d\u2014Anya put up a hand to stop Elspeth\u2019s interruption\u2014\u201cbut there is a possible solution.\u201d</p><p>Her friend looked distressed, but Elspeth gave her an encouraging look. \u201cYes?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe could barter. Aidan has much experience. You could trade labor for reading.\u201d</p><p>Elspeth paled. He\u2019d spent life as a slave, how could she ruin his newfound freedom by making him do labor? And for her? \u201cI wouldn\u2019t. I couldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe needs to learn, and you are the most bookish of all of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour brother Declan is quite learned.\u201d</p><p>Anya shook her head, looking beleaguered. \u201cHe insists on you. Don\u2019t argue.\u201d She glanced at the ring of muck at Elspeth\u2019s skirts. \u201cIt seems you need the assistance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut this place ...\u201d Elspeth looked at the meager pasture around her, at the mucky hooves and empty trough. He\u2019d sailed the seven seas, and their paltry situation mortified her. \u201cHe\u2019ll hate it here.\u201d</p><p>Anya waved a hand at the thought. \u201cMy brother will accustom himself to the idea.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to be something this heroic man had to accustom himself to. She found an excuse to turn her back, scraping a bit of mud from the trough. Chagrin twined deep in her belly, nauseating her. The thought of making Aidan labor on her family\u2019s farm was too much to bear.</p><p>But she needed to keep seeing him. Which meant she needed to keep up their lessons. She felt Anya\u2019s gentle hand on her shoulder and turned to face her friend.</p><p>\u201cThe fact is,\u201d Anya said, \u201che has no choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what will he think when he hears the idea?\u201d</p><p>Anya smiled. \u201cElspeth, it was his idea.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 7</p><p>Aidan lay sprawled on his tiny cot, whittling a wee dragon for his nephew. He\u2019d stalled on his plans to set himself up as a slaver, deciding he\u2019d best improve his reading first. It was just too dangerous for him to blunder into this so ignorant. He had to be careful\u2014everything had to be perfect. Now that he was back on Scottish soil and reminded of all he\u2019d lost, he was desperate to find the man with the black pearl.</p><p>He studied his wee carving. Too bad dragons weren\u2019t as easy to slay as they were to whittle.</p><p>Paring a bit of wood from the dragon\u2019s belly, he let his thoughts turn to family. Young Duncan was almost as new to the household as he, but even so, Aidan thought the lad had guessed him to be the source of his mysterious gifts. Perhaps the boy sensed his uncle\u2019s aversion to attention, but he\u2019d kept his mouth shut, and so Aidan kept the figures coming.</p><p>During the long years he\u2019d lived as the property of another man, it\u2019d become a habit not to call attention to himself. Even the quarters he\u2019d chosen at Dunnottar kept him outside the domestic fray of his MacAlpin siblings. The old guardhouse lay apart from the main tower house, and he loved opening his door to the sound and smell of the waves. Long had he lived in\u2014and been choked by\u2014the sweltering heat of the tropics, and he couldn\u2019t get enough of the brisk air off the North Sea.</p><p>\u201cHard at work?\u201d</p><p>The breezy tone told Aidan exactly whom he\u2019d find standing in his doorway. Twilight was upon them, and though the shadows cast Gregor\u2019s light brown hair a darker shade, his brother still bore the unmistakable coloring of their mother. Aidan\u2019s chest clenched.</p><p>\u201cGregor.\u201d He quickly slid the bit of wood he\u2019d been working under his mattress. He was still becoming accustomed to the company of his family. They were a solid unit, complete with their own dramas and woes, harboring conceptions of him that were in utter disharmony from the man he\u2019d become. Aidan found the lot of them made his mood bristle and his head ache. \u201cWhat brings you this far afield?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCormac insists I give this to you.\u201d Gregor bowed his head, touching a sword to his brow.</p><p>Aidan recognized the simple, unadorned steel basket at once. Though he remained sprawled on his cot, his muscles tensed. \u201cDon\u2019t be put out on my account. You should\u2019ve just had Cormac deliver it, if you\u2019re so loath to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo prickly, brother.\u201d Gregor tossed him the sword, and Aidan bolted upright, snatching it from the air. His brother laughed. \u201cAnd nimble too.\u201d</p><p>Aidan had no taste for blithe chatter and ignored the attempt. Instead, he slid his hand into the basket hilt, tilting the broadsword to catch the light of the window.</p><p>\u201cFather\u2019s blade. Why are you bringing this to me? I was never the man\u2019s favorite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you weren\u2019t his chosen son, were you?\u201d Gregor\u2019s lip curled into a sardonic smile. He strolled into the room, eyeing what few objects Aidan claimed as his own. \u201cThat was me, and more\u2019s the pity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d have me pity you?\u201d Aidan tried to view the room through Gregor\u2019s eyes. Candle, table, knife, washbowl, and the plaid Anya had given him that he\u2019d yet to wear. He must seem quite the piteous creature to one like his dashing elder brother. \u201cHow do you figure?\u201d</p><p>Gregor leaned back against the stone wall, arms crossed over his chest. \u201cWhile you had playmates and outings, I was being trained to follow in our father\u2019s illustrious military footsteps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you completely lacking in sense?\u201d Anger was a continual roil in Aidan\u2019s belly, and it erupted now, the bilious taste familiar and\u2014God spare him\u2014reassuring. \u201cYou\u2019ll recall it was on just such an outing when I was stolen from the lot of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye. But you\u2019re home now, and like it or not, we want you here.\u201d Gregor considered him for a moment. \u201cI find I trust you, despite myself.\u201d</p><p>It was Aidan\u2019s turn to laugh. He was certain the thought had crossed Gregor\u2019s mind that he was secretly a hardened pirate come to loot the family and be off again. \u201cWhy should I care whether you trust me or not?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Gregor seemed amused. \u201cTry to have faith in us, because I\u2019m trying to have faith in you.\u201d</p><p>Assuming his place in the purportedly loving arms of his family was a more awkward mantle to bear than he ever would\u2019ve imagined. \u201cWhy bother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause, prodigal brother, if I didn\u2019t, Cormac would beat, Anya harry, Declan battle, and Bridget badger me until I did.\u201d Gregor wandered back to the door, an easy smile softening his words. \u201cNow put on that plaid\u201d\u2014he gestured to the pile of wool dropped haphazardly in the corner\u2014\u201cand act the MacAlpin.\u201d</p> <p>Aidan stared at that stretch of tartan long after Gregor had gone. He\u2019d not worn a plaid since he was taken\u2014they didn\u2019t wear such things in the Indies, of course. And since his return, that simple, foreign scrap of cloth had struck him as so rife with meaning and import, he hadn\u2019t the heart.</p><p>He donned it, finally, and was reluctant to admit just how moving it was to wear a Scotsman\u2019s breacan feile again.</p><p>It took Aidan an hour to walk to the Farquharson farm. He would\u2019ve loved to ride Gregor\u2019s chestnut gelding, but something about his older brother\u2019s manner spoke to a lingering distrust, despite what he might claim otherwise.</p><p>Aidan had been the one kidnapped so many years ago\u2014why the burden would fall on him to prove his loyalty, he couldn\u2019t fathom. But he\u2019d noticed the MacAlpin men postured like roosters at a cockfight, each one angling for dominance, particularly Gregor. So, it seemed until Aidan proved he wasn\u2019t really some criminally minded blackguard come from the tropics to swindle the family, he\u2019d be held in suspicion.</p><p>And now he was to suffer the humiliation of once again laboring for another man\u2019s bread. His dread grew with every step.</p> <p>But he needed to act the aspiring businessman, and businessmen knew how to read simple words on a page. He\u2019d rather indenture himself again before confessing the shame of his illiteracy to his brothers. Anya was the only one who knew, and with her son, she had no time for tutoring.</p><p>He crested a low hill and spotted the humble Farquharson cottage. Modest pastureland spread before him like a knotty green blanket.</p><p>His eyes found Elspeth at once, tripping over her skirts in a mucky paddock, dragging a heavy bucket behind her. Reaching the trough, she hoisted it up to dump the contents, but even leaning it against the edge, she couldn\u2019t get the bucket high enough, and it kept sliding down.</p><p>The scene was preposterous. He jogged down the hill. What was a bookish girl like this doing as a farmhand?</p><p>Aidan watched the bucket slip from her hands, fall, and land on her toe, the contents spilling along the muddy ground. She doubled over to lean on the fence, breathing heavily, her hands fisted.</p><p>He noted her entirely inappropriate footwear. She\u2019d be lucky if she hadn\u2019t broken a toe.</p> <p>Last time he\u2019d seen her, she\u2019d thought he was a brute. He might as well be a brute in truth.</p><p>\u201cEasy, luvvie.\u201d With a hand on the fence, Aidan vaulted into the paddock. He plucked the bucket from the dirt, scooping as much of the oats back in as he could.</p><p>She looked up, stricken. Her blond hair looked yellow in the sunlight, and he wondered if it was his imagination that put matching yellow flecks in her light blue eyes. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>He bit his tongue, wanting instead to snap, Don\u2019t fret, I\u2019ll not sully you with my boorish hands. Instead, he asked, \u201cIs it breeding time?\u201d</p><p>Seeing the girl\u2019s blush, he swallowed a swear. She\u2019d best be a good teacher, because it seemed he was going to have to work hard for these lessons.</p><p>\u201cBreeding?\u201d she asked weakly.</p><p>He spoke through gritted teeth. \u201cYes. I asked, are the sheep currently breeding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, breeding.\u201d Her shoulders relaxed. \u201cNo, we\u2019re not breeding. My father didn\u2019t ...\u201d She turned from him and shrugged. \u201cWe don\u2019t own a ram.\u201d</p> <p>He ran his hand through the oats in the trough. \u201cBut if you\u2019re not breeding, why do they eat this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s their feed.\u201d</p><p>He cursed under his breath. What sort of daftie was this girl\u2019s father? \u201cThey get grain this time of year?\u201d</p><p>Though she wasn\u2019t facing him, he could tell she gave a cursory nod.</p><p>He studied her back. She was a wisp of a thing, her shoulder blades sharp against the linen of her dress. Anger flared, hot and quick. \u201cAnd what have you eaten today?\u201d</p><p>She turned to look at him, and he saw he\u2019d hit close to the mark. But instead of seeing her usual fear of him glimmer in her eyes, Aidan read despair.</p><p>His tone softened. \u201cWhat I mean to say is, unless the beasts are breeding\u2014which, without a ram, they obviously are not\u2014grass is enough for them.\u201d</p><p>He eyed the fence. Why they\u2019d penned the sheep in a muddy paddock rather than put them out to pasture was beyond him. \u201cBut it seems your father didn\u2019t take the time to learn this properly.\u201d</p><p>That kindled a fire in her. \u201cYou\u2019ll not speak so of my father.\u201d</p><p>He felt a grin pop onto his face. The girl had unexpected mettle. She was loyal to her family. He liked that.</p><p>\u201cFair enough.\u201d The flock had come to feed at the trough, and Aidan waded among them, prodding at bellies, peeking in ears. \u201cHe\u2019s started a wool business, you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, we have.\u201d</p><p>We. He grinned at that. If her father captained a sinking ship, Aidan imagined she\u2019d set herself up as first mate. \u201cAnd who will shear them? Come spring?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will, I suppose.\u201d</p><p>His grin faded as renegade anger surged anew. \u201cLuvvie, shearing is hard work. It\u2019s man\u2019s work. Do you even have the proper tools?\u201d</p><p>A muscle in her cheek twitched. \u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>He knew she was lying, but he saw right through it. The woman was guileless, and it was foreign to him.</p><p>Aidan stepped closer, and this time when she shifted away from him, it stoked an entirely different emotion. There was anger, yes, always anger. But at the sight of the flush on her cheeks and her breathlessly parted lips, that anger mingled with something he didn\u2019t recognize. An unfamiliar, wanting spark of a feeling that he found he wanted to stoke to life.</p><p>He stepped even closer, backing her into the fence, close enough to discern the scent of oats that clung to her. On the most preposterous impulse, he raised his hand to brush some dirt from her cheek, then quickly lowered it again. \u201cShearing happens but once per year,\u201d he said, his voice huskier than he\u2019d intended. \u201cHow will you manage between times?\u201d</p><p>\u201cH-how do you know all this?\u201d She glanced away, avoiding his gaze as nervously as she\u2019d avoided his question. \u201cI thought you worked sugarcane.\u201d</p><p>Aidan felt the emotion bleed from his face. The cane. He took a long step back. Was that why she couldn\u2019t look at him? Because she saw him as an indentured servant? Whenever he looked at his scars, at his detested brand, he saw a body that was forfeit. His had been a body owned by another. If he couldn\u2019t see beyond the marks of his slavery, how could he expect her to?</p><p>He turned away, anxious that this perplexing woman not see his temper flare yet again. He took a deep breath before speaking again. \u201cIt was a sugar plantation, yes. One with many hands to feed. We ... they ... they raised sheep. Barbados Blackbellies. For meat.\u201d</p><p>Eager to busy himself and calm his mind, he began to walk along the spindly fence, inspecting as he went. The rails had been poorly cut, and already hung broken in a number of spots. They needed a stone perimeter, not this makeshift thing. He jiggled the gate to test it and then opened it wide.</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d She jogged up behind him. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLetting these beasts roam. The sheep need to graze. And you need to save the oats for your own belly.\u201d</p><p>He scanned the surrounding countryside. \u201cYou\u2019ll want to parcel this off into two pastures. How do you currently herd the beasts to and fro?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ... I do that.\u201d</p><p>A laugh burst from him. \u201cYou chase them about? By your lonesome?\u201d</p><p>She looked abashed, and he cursed himself. Talking to the woman was like walking on eggshells. \u201cWell, we\u2019ll have to amend that. Can\u2019t have you racing around the countryside like a sheepdog.\u201d</p><p>Her brows knit into a frown. \u201cI don\u2019t race about like a dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen how do you herd them?\u201d he asked, trying his damndest to look serious.</p><p>She wrung her hands. Poor chit appeared to be summoning all her dignity, which was a tall order considering the ring of muck about her skirts. \u201cI ... whistle.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t help it any longer. He let free a broad smile. \u201cYou whistle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye. I whistle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuvvie, I\u2019d pay my last bob to hear you whistle.\u201d</p><p>Her answering shrug was meek, but the smile in her eyes wasn\u2019t, and it brightened her, transforming those delicate features into something luminous and deep. She shuttered herself just as quickly, but not before Aidan had spotted it: like him, this Elspeth was more than she pretended to be.</p><p>Days later she found them: a pair of shears, sharp, shining, and new, nestled atop the paddock gate, with only a blue ribbon tied in a neat bow to tell Elspeth they were a gift meant for her.</p><p>Chapter 8</p><p>They\u2019d had nearly a dozen lessons, and each had meant a visit from Aidan to her family farm. Elspeth treasured each one, waking early on days she expected him, getting well on top of her chores so that she could spend more time watching him by the sheep pasture.</p><p>And watch was all she could do, for he truly was doing a man\u2019s work, cordoning off proper pastureland and building a low stone wall to fence it in.</p><p>Their old paddock, originally built for a pair of ponies now long gone, had been a good way to keep their few cattle penned and safe from reivers. But Aidan claimed it wasn\u2019t large enough to accommodate twenty head of sheep. He said if the beasts could roam, they\u2019d give better milk.</p><p>Elspeth didn\u2019t care a whit either way. All she knew was it meant Aidan showed up to haul fence stones, and that she got to watch him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Not that his magnificent physical presence was all she appreciated about him, though his taut, sweaty maleness was a shock indeed to her body. But more than that, more than his roguish appeal, and even more than what she liked to think of as his unexpected moments of thoughtfulness, she\u2019d been taken aback by just how bright Aidan was.</p><p>And it wasn\u2019t just that he knew about farms and could speak with authority on the tending of sheep\u2014though how reassuring it was to have a man speak with confidence on things about which she felt so at sea. It was that he was not merely world-wise, but quick too, with a sharp wit and ready understanding. It was clear in his words, in the way he expressed his thoughts.</p><p>He was a torch that burned brightly, but crudely yet, like a great, unruly blast of flame, his mind ablaze with opinions and questions that, though he didn\u2019t always give them voice, she could read in his eyes.</p> <p>She\u2019d spent the past hour dithering about what excuse she could devise that\u2019d bring her out of the house to see him down at the pasture. As she dabbed a fine sheen of sweat from her brow, it hit her. It was an unusually warm day, with no wind to cool the bright sun, and the man would be thirsty.</p><p>The shade of their tiny cottage had cooled the morning\u2019s milk, and before she could change her mind, she filled their best pewter cup and set out to find him.</p><p>The sight of him stole her breath, as it always did. Stole her breath, and broke her heart. He hauled the heavy rocks with such ease, placing them with the skill of experience, and the overly masculine display set her heart tripping. But it was heartbreaking too, to think how he\u2019d come by that experience, how he\u2019d earned the thick cut of those muscles on his arms and torso.</p><p>He must\u2019ve sensed her there, standing across the glen, because he looked up. Shading his eyes, he gave her a mute nod. Even from the distance, she saw the exertion writ plain on his body.</p><p>The day was uncharacteristically clear, with no clouds to shield the sun. Aidan wore his plaid, which must\u2019ve felt like a blanket around him, and his linen shirt was soaked through with sweat.</p> <p>He nestled a stone into place, and using a sleeve to wipe his brow, he came and met her halfway. She watched his stride, so powerful and sure. Was this how he\u2019d looked aboard ship? She imagined his mouth curling into a cocky grin. He\u2019d call out to his men, and with a nimble leap, would race up the rigging as graceful as a cat.</p><p>She blinked hard to clear the image from her head.</p><p>As he got closer, she saw he really was soaked through with sweat. Even so, he refused to take his shirt off like other farmhands she\u2019d seen.</p><p>The tropics had turned him a burnished brown. She\u2019d tried and not been able to find any end to that tanned skin through the V of his collar. Did that mean he\u2019d shucked his shirt while he worked?</p><p>And yet here he was, the fringe of his brown hair slicked black with sweat, and he hadn\u2019t even pushed up his sleeves. Why would he choose to stay covered in such heat?</p><p>Was it because he was branded? She\u2019d heard rumors he had been, and fretted over where the mark might be and what it might look like. Were they initials? An image? Was it on his buttocks, or chest, or back? The thought of him undergoing such suffering chilled her.</p> <p>The cup was warming in her hand, and she cursed her foolishness. She\u2019d brought him milk when what he really needed was water, and an entire bucketful at that.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019ve come,\u201d he said, reaching her.</p><p>\u201cYou are?\u201d Her heart swooned.</p><p>He greeted her with a kiss. \u201cI can\u2019t make it through the day without you ... the sight of you, like a cool stream, refreshes me.\u201d</p><p>She twined bold fingers through his hair. \u201cAnd yet, you enflame me. You, a fire which cannot be doused.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been mucking through sheep shit all day. The beasts need to spread out more. How far does your pasture reach?\u201d He pointed away from their cottage into the distance. \u201cDoes your father own just the glen, or does he have rights to that hillside beyond?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh ...\u201d She followed his line of sight. \u201cHe ... I ... we maintain the house, down across the glen, just to the base of the hill.\u201d</p><p>He scowled. \u201cIt\u2019s narrow, your valley.\u201d</p> <p>She needed no reminders of how little she claimed in this world. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>He turned to get back to work. Leaving too soon.</p><p>\u201cI have milk,\u201d she blurted. She stepped up behind him, and he almost knocked into her as he spun back around.</p><p>He stared at her cup as though she\u2019d offered a mug of hemlock tea. Her cheeks burned hot, realizing she was a naive fool. A dangerous man like him\u2014he was nearly a pirate, after all\u2014was surely only interested in harder drink, like whiskey or rumbullion.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just I thought you must be thirsty. In this heat.\u201d Backing away from him, she stumbled on a clump of dirt, spilling some of the milk onto her hand.</p><p>Elspeth recovered her footing and masked her clumsiness by spinning and heading straight for the old paddock. It had the side benefit of concealing her furiously blushing face as she wiped spilled milk onto her skirts.</p><p>She felt him follow her, making her intensely conscious of her every move. They kept a barrel of rainwater outside the gate, and she busily retrieved the dipper. \u201cWe also have water. Unless you don\u2019t drink water.\u201d</p><p>He reached beyond her, grabbing the dipper from her hand. \u201cI drink water like any other man.\u201d</p><p>His voice had been brusque. Was he annoyed? Simply thirsty? She had no way to know.</p><p>She watched his throat work as he guzzled the water. It spilled from the corners of his mouth, dripping down his chin and onto his chest. Damp bloomed across his shirt, making it translucent. The fabric stuck to him, and she couldn\u2019t pull her eyes from the carved muscle of his torso and the dark halo of hair leading from his chest down the line of his belly.</p><p>When he came up for air, their gazes caught. He looked like a wild man, a true rogue, dirty and panting, his sweaty hair skewed every which way. She\u2019d never seen a more handsome man. Remembering herself, she closed her mouth and swallowed hard.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s better,\u201d he said.</p><p>For a split second, she thought he referred to the way she\u2019d been gaping like a fish, but then realized he was merely referring to the drink. \u201cYes. It\u2019s water. I mean, rainwater. It\u2019s fresh rainwater.\u201d She cringed.</p><p>Something softened on his face, and pointing at the cup in her hand, he asked, \u201cMight I really try that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Nodding eagerly, she held out her cup. \u201cAye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember the last time I tasted milk. As a boy, I didn\u2019t think of it. Until I couldn\u2019t have it.\u201d As he reached, his sleeve inched up to reveal a wide braid of skin, paler and smoother than the rest, wrapping around his wrist like a bracelet.</p><p>Or a shackle. She stifled her gasp with a fake cough.</p><p>Aidan was scarred. Of course he was. That was why he never pushed up his sleeves. What other atrocities did that thin layer of linen hide?</p><p>He brought the milk to his lips and, shutting his eyes, drank slowly, savoring it like he hadn\u2019t the water. Finishing, his eyes opened, and he met hers with a smile. \u201cAll those years, all those sheep, and never a cup of milk.\u201d</p><p>Elspeth\u2019s heart had been cracking since she\u2019d first laid eyes on him, but those words marked the moment it broke for good. The sight of him relishing such a simple pleasure had her mourning the childhood he\u2019d never known. One like hers, with ladlefuls of fresh milk, and innocently snatched apples, and rare sunny days in the glen, narrow though it may be.</p><p>She vowed to steal him an apple the first chance she got.</p><p>\u201cDo they have apples?\u201d she asked abruptly. \u201cIn the Indies, I mean. Did you eat apples?\u201d</p><p>He gave her a puzzled look, but didn\u2019t seem annoyed, and that struck her as a small triumph. \u201cNo, no apples. Cornmeal boiled with sheep scraps, salt bread, salt meat ... not an apple in sight.\u201d</p><p>She ached for the child he\u2019d been, living on cured meats and scraps. Glimpsing his scar had made her blood run cold. Had he been shackled as a child? Had he been in and out of shackles his whole life?</p><p>She believed Aidan hid other scars, on both body and soul. And she now believed the hideous rumor must be true, that he concealed a brand somewhere on his body. Her eyes inadvertently skimmed his shirt. She knew she\u2019d never be able to discern it through his clothing, but still she couldn\u2019t tear her eyes away, straining to see altered texture or color through the fabric, scanning his chest, down his arms, to the flat sheen of scar at his wrist.</p><p>She looked up and blanched.</p><p>Aidan had noticed her scrutiny and was staring at her through slitted eyes. Stiffening, he tugged his sleeve back over his wrist. \u201cEnough of this,\u201d he snapped. \u201cIt\u2019s time to work.\u201d</p><p>He left her standing there, an empty cup in her hand and an ache in her soul.</p><p>Just when he\u2019d been enjoying himself, enjoying the Scottish air in his lungs and home soil beneath his feet, living the fantasy of an honest day\u2019s work with an honest woman by his side, he\u2019d looked up to find her staring at the cursed scar on his wrist. Staring at him as though he were a monkey in a cage.</p><p>Sitting shrouded in darkness at the edge of his bed, he studied his wrist, the guttering candle casting yellow light on the slick band of skin. Shackles. It was merely one of the many marks that others had carved upon him, like dogs pissing on their territory. He\u2019d been mutilated, swaths of his skin buckled and gnarled into ribbons of scars. From shackles on wrists and ankles. The whip at his back. And the brand on his forearm that would forever announce him the property of Wellcome Plantation.</p><p>Elspeth\u2019s eyes had gone wide when she\u2019d seen his wrist. If she flinched so at that, how would she react to his brand? How she\u2019d pale. It would disgust her, terrify her. Shock her even more than she was already.</p><p>Tugging up his sleeve, he glared at the crudely shaped letters. WP.</p><p>His tutor seemed too good to be true. Meek and nervous, thoughtful and kind. Such a woman would probably be too frightened, too repulsed even to touch him.</p><p>She\u2019d touched him once, with a light hand on his, guiding his quill. But what would it feel like to have her hands on his body? His chest ached to imagine it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He\u2019d only ever been with hardened women, who perceived sex as currency, or pursued it for their self-flattering pleasure alone. But Elspeth was gentle, and innocent still.</p><p>In her darkest, most passionate heart, who was she really? If he touched her, would he find the meek girl she showed to the world, or the woman with the spark in her eyes? Because such a woman would be a wondrous thing\u2014over, under, and beside a man.</p><p>Which was the true Elspeth? He ran his finger over the brand, thinking he had a mind to shock the real woman right out of her.</p> <p>Chapter 9</p><p>Elspeth nearly fainted as she led Imogen back into the paddock after milking. Aidan had showed up shirtless, wearing naught but his plaid, and was galloping down the hillside to the pasture. To her pasture.</p><p>He crested the hill. Hiking her skirts, she ran to meet him halfway.</p><p>Naked chest heaving, he swept her into his arms.</p><p>\u201cI raced the whole way. I couldn\u2019t stay away.\u201d</p> <p>She laughed as he spun her. \u201cAre you come to kiss me?\u201d</p><p>A sheep butted her hip, and she looked down to find a lean black face looking up at her. The creature was a scraggly thing, with a star of white on her forehead. \u201cAye, Athena, and so you\u2019re right. A girl needs to remember what she\u2019s about.\u201d She stole a glance at Aidan setting to work in the distance. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not dashing rogues who don\u2019t care a nit whether or not we\u2019re alive.\u201d</p><p>Digging a handful of oats from her pocket, she lured Athena back inside the gate. \u201cI\u2019m just a tutor, and we best remember that. Aidan only helps us because he owes a debt. I\u2019m not a pirate bride\u2014just a farmer\u2019s daughter, and a decidedly poor one at that.\u201d</p><p>She realized her palm was empty and dusted her hands, seeing the sheep had wandered off again. It happened to be in the direction of Aidan\u2019s fence. Elspeth scurried to follow. \u201cGoing to steal a closer look, are you? Naughty lass.\u201d</p><p>Aidan continued to work, but he ignored them utterly, and so she let her eyes linger. \u201cCan you fancy that? The man is half naked. I\u2019ll bet you thought you were dreaming the sight. He\u2019s magnificent, like an Adonis.\u201d She butted the sheep with her hip. \u201cYou\u2019re a wanton to be staring so. What say you? Has the sun and sweat finally gotten to him? Is that why he\u2019s come only in his plaid?\u201d</p><p>Aidan\u2019s head popped up as though summoned, his eyes landing directly on hers.</p> <p>Cheeks burning, she gave a weak wave, and turned her attention back to the sheep. \u201cNow look how you\u2019ve embarrassed yourself. We need to concentrate\u2014there\u2019s work to be done. Shall we take you to the far hill for a graze?\u201d</p><p>She let the other animals out of the paddock, stealing another look at Aidan as she held open the gate. \u201cLosh, but his body is the same color as his arms. You mark me, ladies: this isn\u2019t the first time the man has labored shirtless and bootless. They say he has a brand, but blast if my cursed eyes can make it out.\u201d</p><p>She squinted. The sun shimmered on his skin, and there seemed to be an uneven glint of light and shadow. A scar? She couldn\u2019t be sure.</p><p>He picked up a stone and hauled it into place.</p><p>\u201cLook how he moves, lifting those rocks as though they were nothing.\u201d The last of her flock had exited, and dragging the gate shut, she stepped closer to him. \u201cI\u2019m afraid we need to walk right by him, so mind your manners. None of you make fools of yourselves.\u201d Herding the animals, she peered his way, and he came into focus as she neared.</p><p>\u201cLosh,\u201d she whispered, \u201che\u2019s powerful indeed.\u201d His was a broad expanse of flesh, and though she\u2019d seen through his shirt how strong he was, it was nothing compared to how he appeared without it. He had muscles in places she\u2019d never before seen\u2014at the slope between neck and shoulder, on the backs of his arms. \u201cLike a Greek marble.\u201d</p><p>He angled toward them. Catching a glimpse of his chiseled chest, Elspeth cut her eyes away with a gasp. Her eyes went to her flock, and she spotted a few sheep toddling off. She scolded herself as she ran to herd them back into place. She dug her hands into her skirts to tempt the sheep with handfuls of grain. \u201cPlease come, girls. I\u2019d sooner eat my bonnet than whistle like a fishwife in front of our pirate hero. So please just follow me, like the docile wee lambs I know you are.\u201d</p><p>She shooed them along, adding, \u201cAnd we must all of us stop spying.\u201d</p> <p>But she felt Aidan\u2019s presence. He was like a grand ship on the horizon, inevitably drawing her gaze once more. He was settling a particularly large stone into place. As he braced it against his thighs, the rock snagged the wool of his breacan feile, hiking it up to reveal a glimpse of carved thigh.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d She glanced away, then back, then away again, her cheeks burning with awareness. But she spotted more of her beasts making a break for it, and her exclamations grew more heated. \u201cOh, pish!\u201d</p><p>She jogged to catch them, circling them back into place. \u201cStay put, you,\u201d she said, digging in her pockets, and was surrounded at once by dull eyes and butting heads. \u201cCrud.</p><p>I\u2019m afraid that\u2019s it for the oats. We must all stay where we belong.\u201d She sighed, knowing her place. It was alone, with only a flock of dull-eyed sheep for company. \u201cAll of us.\u201d</p><p>Reaching the base of the hill, Elspeth did a quick head count and frowned. She was off by one. And so she counted again. \u201cNineteen. Fool chit of a fool lovesick girl,\u201d she grumbled to herself. \u201cWho\u2019s missing?\u201d</p><p>As the sheep began to graze, she scanned them. A runty, wee thing with a jet-black face and white patch at the forehead was notably absent. \u201cWee Athena has given us the slip.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes went from the sheep, all busily eating, to Aidan, hard at work in the middle of the valley. \u201cWhat say you, girls? Do you think our mysterious hero has seen her?\u201d Standing tall, she beat the dust from her skirts. \u201cNo time like the present to ask. And none of you budge,\u201d she ordered, though amid ankle-high grass, she knew none would.</p><p>She walked toward him, imagining confidence, practicing in her head what she might say, but she frowned at the results. Do you know where my sheep is? Has a sheep wandered by? It all sounded ridiculous.</p><p>\u201cHave you seen my sheep?\u201d</p><p>He threw the heavy rock from his hands as though it weighed nothing. \u201cForget the sheep.\u201d</p><p>Stepping close, he wrapped his hand about her neck for a deep kiss. He smelled of earth and sweat.</p><p>Breathless, she parted from him. \u201cWhat sheep?\u201d</p><p>Elspeth clenched her fists, forcing herself not to clap a hand to her mouth. She saw Aidan clearly now, as well as the thick scars that crisscrossed his back, gruesome testament to whippings past.</p><p>She hovered behind him, waiting in silence, but he didn\u2019t look up from his work. No longer able to bear the sight of his back, she finally blurted, \u201cHave you a sheep?\u201d</p><p>He turned to face her, his expression flat. \u201cNo, luvvie. But haven\u2019t you twenty already?\u201d</p><p>She cringed. \u201cI mean ... have you seen my sheep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, and I\u2019ve smelled them too.\u201d He bent, returning to his work.</p><p>\u201cNo ... that is to say ... one went missing. Have you seen her?\u201d</p><p>He gave a brusque shake to his head, this time not even sparing her a glance.</p><p>Elspeth\u2019s gaze lingered on him a moment more. Shirtless and gleaming with sweat, the man truly did look a pirate from the seven seas. Or a boxer. Or a gladiator. She imagined him conquering a bloodthirsty lion with naught but a splintered pike, the wind ruffling his hair. Of course such a man wouldn\u2019t spare a glance for a woman like her. \u201cOh, then,\u201d she said to that scarred back, \u201cwell ... thank you.\u201d</p><p>She was a fool and a ninny.</p><p>She smoothed her skirts, wishing it were as easy to smooth her pride. Looking down, she noticed a bit of sheep muck smeared along her hip. She frowned. What a plain homely-dowdy she was, in last year\u2019s frock of threadbare tan linen, speckled with the ghosts of stains too stubborn to wash out.</p><p>She trudged back to the flock, deep in her despairing thoughts. If only Aidan could see the true Elspeth. If only he could see into her heart, he\u2019d realize what a passionate and deeply feeling soul she was.</p><p>Driving the dull-witted beasts back into the paddock gave her too much time to think. If only she could have more in life. Not more money\u2014though she could certainly do with some of that\u2014but more of things like love, or adventure. It was why her books called to her. They transported her to a life greater than her own.</p><p>But when she put her books down, she was always reminded of her real and dreadfully boring life. Sometimes she wished she were as dim-witted as her livestock, and maybe then her days might be easier to tolerate.</p><p>She thought of Aidan\u2019s world, so mysterious and dangerous and tragic. How he\u2019d managed to escape indentured servitude was surely something worthy of epic poetry.</p><p>If only he could see that she too would never shy from adventure. Never would she turn from his pain. She\u2019d trace her fingers along his scars, and ease his haunted memories.</p><p>They could sail the seven seas together, avenging his stolen youth. She\u2019d wear loose trousers and a scarf tied about her head. There\u2019d be thick ropes of gold looped around her neck, to match the hoops in her ears.</p><p>But she was no pirate bride. Instead she was a supposed sheep farmer, and doing quite the mediocre job at that. And Elspeth knew for a fact that poets weren\u2019t exactly inclined to sing the virtues of shepherdesses in their romantic sonnets.</p><p>She shooed the last of her flock back into the paddock and then turned a circle, scanning the surrounding hills, but it was no good. Athena was long gone.</p><p>They couldn\u2019t afford to lose a single one of those blasted animals. Her eyes snagged on the old dule tree at the top of the hill. She\u2019d climbed it a thousand times and would just have to climb it once more. It afforded a panoramic view of the glen, and if she couldn\u2019t spot Athena from that vantage, then Athena wasn\u2019t to be spotted.</p><p>Dules were good for hanging, and apparently this particular one had seen its share. It was ancient and gnarled, and folk had called it the hanging tree for as long as she could remember. Though she\u2019d never been allowed to witness, Elspeth knew for a fact it\u2019d served as a Covenanter gallows in her own lifetime. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Hiking up her skirts, she strode up the hill, humming an old folk tune.</p><p>Come follow, follow, follow, follow, follow, follow me.</p><p>Whither shall I follow follow follow,</p> <p>Whither shall I follow follow thee.</p><p>To the Gallows</p><p>To the Gallows</p><p>To the Gallows, Gallows Tree.</p><p>Her voice grew louder as she went, and she fancied she was as bold as her voice. She could climb ships\u2019 rigging and sing pirate songs too, if but given the chance.</p> <p>She didn\u2019t pause when she got to the base, didn\u2019t need to think, simply placed hands and feet in the same spots she\u2019d been using her whole life, and so clambered quickly up. Reaching a spot she thought was high enough, she straightened and edged along a branch, steadying her hands on a branch before her. Chewing her lip, she sang to the same tune:</p><p>Athena, Athena, come to me,</p><p>I\u2019m climbing like an ass up the Gallows Tree.</p><p>No sheep to be seen, but he was right in her line of sight. She flicked her eyes away, fearing the merest glimpse of Aidan might call his attention to her. She\u2019d cling to every scrap of dignity she could get, and climbing like a lad up the hanging tree wasn\u2019t the most elegant of pastimes.</p><p>Oh, Aidan, Aidan, Aidan, let me be,</p><p>I can see your broad back from the Gallows Tree,</p> <p>I\u2019d be your pirate bride if you\u2019d agree,</p><p>You could call me luvvie and your wild sweet pea\u2014</p><p>Needing to scan over the far hill, she scampered higher, humming as she went. The greenery grew denser as she climbed, and no longer did she need to watch her step to find decent footing. Focusing only on the branches under her hands, she lost track of how high she went.</p><p>Until her foot slipped. She clamped her lips around a squeal, cursing herself. Pirate brides most definitely neither squealed nor yelped.</p><p>Glancing up, she realized just how dense the leaves had become, and shimmied out along the branch for a clearer look. Again, she purposely avoided looking in Aidan\u2019s direction; she had more pride than to somehow call his eyes to her. Instead, she squinted, scanning past the hilltop to a ridge in the distance. Her vision wasn\u2019t perfect, but she could spy green from white, and thought there might be a woolly body in the distance, though she couldn\u2019t be sure.</p><p>Athena, Athena, Athena, appear to me,</p><p>Appear this instant, or my wrath you\u2019ll see,</p><p>I\u2019ll bet you taste so good and muttony ...</p> <p>Jutting her chin out, Elspeth peered as hard as she could, willing the distance to resolve into focus. If only the angle were just a wee bit better.</p><p>\u201cYou beast!\u201d She knew it. It was a little white beast, she was almost sure of it. She stepped higher, and the movement was answered with a loud creak. This time she did yelp, gripping tight to the branch in front of her. Another crack swiftly followed, and the bough dropped six inches.</p><p>Heart galloping in her throat, Elspeth wrapped both arms around the branches at her chest. \u201cOh, sweet Jesu Domine, fool lass,\u201d she whispered. \u201cWhat\u2019ve you done now?\u201d</p><p>She scanned at her feet. She\u2019d edged too far out from the trunk, teetering on wispy thin branches high above the ground. Too high to survive a fall. As though on cue, there was a groan and a snap, louder than before, and the branch simply dropped away from her feet.</p><p>Elspeth clung tight to the boughs at her chest, feet scrabbling like a beetle on its back. She regained footing, and quickly began her descent, hugging her body close to all the branches, hoping if she spread out elbows and hands and feet, the thinner branches would hold her.</p><p>She grew calmer as she neared the ground, but she grew more cavalier too, and made the mistake of grabbing something too thin to support her weight. As she reached her leg down, searching for her next step, there was a loud, splintering crack, and she toppled forward into the other branches, arms splayed before her, one leg dangling in the air, the other crooked awkwardly high behind her. The branch she held was still attached to the tree, but not for long, and not strongly enough to support her weight. She was paralyzed, feeling absurd, like the statue of some great, ungainly bird, frozen in flight.</p><p>\u201cWhat on earth are you doing?\u201d</p><p>Oh damn, damn, blasted ... Every curse she could muster tripped silently through her lips. He\u2019d come. She peered down through the leaves to see him standing beneath her, greenery casting dappled light on his sweatsheened body. Cripes.</p><p>Of all the people to come witness her folly, it had to be Aidan. Why couldn\u2019t it have been someone else? Her father? Angus even?</p><p>She reached her free leg out, bobbing her ankle, in a blind attempt to find purchase that wasn\u2019t there for the finding. Criminy.</p><p>Clearing her throat, she assumed what she hoped was calm and ladylike composure. \u201cI... I seem to be ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cStuck in a tree? I can see that, luvvie.\u201d Amusement threatened to curl his mouth into a smile, and Elspeth wished the sight elicited anger rather than this hideous mortification she currently felt. \u201cMight I be of some</p><p>assistance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you,\u201d she said primly. \u201cI can manage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClearly.\u201d Humor tinged his voice, and she pretended not to hear it. He strolled a circle beneath her, and she flushed red and hot to realize he must have a perfect line of sight straight up her skirts. \u201cBut,\u201d he added, \u201cbefore I leave you to your... aerie, I must ask what you\u2019re doing up there in the first place? You are a wise and wide-eyed girl ... perhaps you are playing at being an owl?\u201d</p><p>She set her chin, mustering as much dignity as one could when one was stuck in a tree. \u201cAthena scampered off, and I was merely trying to find her.\u201d She stretched her leg all around, and though she finally found a branch on which to rest, she could tell by the give at her foot that it wasn\u2019t strong enough to bear her weight.</p><p>\u201cAthena?\u201d</p><p>She caught his eye, informing him in all seriousness, \u201cMy sheep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour sheep.\u201d That budding smile bloomed full force. \u201cYour sheep has a name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that name is Athena.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s right.\u201d She adjusted her hands. The bark was beginning to cut into her palms, sweating now with her efforts. \u201cIt\u2019s the Greek goddess of wisdom.\u201d</p><p>He nodded sagely. \u201cWisdom ... like climbing onto a too-thin branch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is the patron of Athens,\u201d she explained. Her voice was even, but inside she was crowing, Go away, turn around, leave me be.</p><p>A fine plume of panic was unfurling in her belly. If she had to fall\u2014and she feared she might\u2014she\u2019d just as soon fall in private.</p><p>\u201cOh, well that does change it, doesn\u2019t it? Does this goddess of a sheep come when called?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mock.\u201d Her humiliation gave a snap to her voice.</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cOh, luvvie, I\u2019d not think of it.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d pretend he was being serious, hoping the equanimity in her voice would show him how blind to fear she was. \u201cAs you can see, she most decidedly does not come when called.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr whistled, as the case may be?\u201d He cocked his head. \u201cBecause you told me you whistle to herd them. So I think you meant that this Athena does not come when whistled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you are mocking me.\u201d She clamped her teeth against the quivering of her chin.</p><p>Aidan gave her an earnest half bow. \u201cThere are many things in this world that I mock, and to my surprise I am finding that you, Elspeth, are not among them.\u201d</p><p>The sound of her name on his lips sent a quivering through her limbs. She studied him intently, wondering if this was fresh mockery of a sort.</p><p>\u201cSo then.\u201d Shading his eyes, he scanned the horizon. \u201cAny sight of the missing mutton?\u201d</p><p>The branch creaked again, and she squeaked. Lips pursed, she gave a quick shake of her head. So much for her display of passion, bravery, and spontaneity.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re stuck, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged as well as one could whilst dangling from a tree, but realized it was no good hiding her current situation. She was clearly as stuck as a thief on the gallows. \u201cMayhap.\u201d</p><p>He strolled around the trunk. \u201cMayhap I think you are.\u201d He returned to his original spot, and crossing his hands at his chest, asked, \u201cWhen were you intending on asking for help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not\u2014\u201d</p><p>There was a horrible, shuddering groan as the branch listed dangerously lower. Aidan leaped to beneath where she hung. \u201cJump to me, luvvie. I think this sheep hunt is at an end.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, avoiding his gaze. Surely she\u2019d squash him. Or break his bones. Or land with her skirts up over her head. No, she would find her way out of this. Without him to bear witness. \u201cI\u2019m fine here. Please get on about your work.\u201d</p><p>He laughed outright. \u201cGet on about my work? What if I propose this is my work? A farmer\u2019s daughter in possession of an unbroken neck strikes me as the linchpin of a smoothly running enterprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, truly, I can manage.\u201d</p><p>There was the sound of splintering wood. She reached to a neighboring branch and held firm just as the other finally cracked. Aidan jumped out of its path as the bough slammed through layers of green, coming to rest at a sharp angle, its tip digging into the ground.</p><p>She dangled there, arms wide, feet hanging limply beneath her. She could let go, but she\u2019d follow the same path, slamming through sharp branches on her way to the ground.</p><p>\u201cCome now, Elspeth.\u201d His tone was somber now, standing beneath her, beckoning with open arms. \u201cDrop down to me.\u201d</p><p>She gave a tight shake to her head.</p><p>\u201cDammit, girl. If you herded as other farmers do, you wouldn\u2019t find yourself caught up a tree.\u201d He disappeared from her view, but she heard him rustling at her back.</p><p>His hands grasped her waist from behind, and she choked. Chagrin screwed her face, her eyes shut tight. He must be at eye level with her thighs, or God forfend, her bottom.</p><p>\u201cCome, then.\u201d His voice was tight, and she wondered if he was affected too. \u201cI\u2019ve got you. Just let go.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Aidan\u2019s voice was gentle, and it gave her the courage to look back, dragging her eyes from the strong hands at her waist, along a chiseled arm, to the man standing below her. He stood on a thick branch jutting off the base of the trunk.</p><p>She was fooling herself to think she heard something in his voice. Why would a man like him be affected by her meager bottom? A dashing rogue like Aidan would desire someone more exotic. And more curvaceous, surely.</p><p>She\u2019d heard the stories from Cormac\u2019s wife, Marjorie. How wealthy plantation wives engaged in scandalous liaisons with their fieldworkers. One look at Aidan\u2019s rippling muscles and Elspeth knew: he\u2019d have been irresistible to each and every one of them. He\u2019d be accustomed to grand ladies, flamboyant and worldly, who\u2019d be the pinnacle of fashion.</p> <p>Her eyes went to her ugly old skirts, and she grimaced.</p><p>\u201cAre you afraid I\u2019ll muss you?\u201d he asked, his voice gone steely.</p><p>Was he angry? \u201cWhat?

I ...\u201d</p><p>His fingers curled more tightly into her waist. \u201cOr perhaps it\u2019s that the dirty farmhand isn\u2019t good enough even to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no.\u201d She shook her head frantically. \u201cYou misunderstand.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo I? It appears you\u2019d rather fall and break your neck than let me\u2014\u201d</p><p>Elspeth let go.</p><p>Chapter 10</p><p>She dropped, and he caught her hard about the waist, steadying himself at once, his legs braced wide on the thick branch beneath him. They were in an awkward position, both facing forward. He gave her a quick toss and a spin, and Elspeth found herself cradled in his arms.</p><p>She gazed up into his blue eyes, and they were hard on her, wary and suspicious.</p><p>\u201cYou misunderstood,\u201d she repeated, more quietly this time. Feeling like an unwieldy bundle in his arms, she tentatively wrapped her arms around his neck.</p> <p>To her shock, he let her.</p><p>His naked skin was hot, even through the fabric of her dress. She longed to stroke a finger down what she knew was a glistening expanse of chest, but she dared not even look down, much less touch him. She waited for him to drop her, or shove her aside, but he merely held her, their eyes locked in this strange and wonderful moment.</p><p>Branches creaked and leaves rustled, but those were the only sounds. Feeling emboldened, she shifted and turned into him, twining her fingers snugly together. She hoped he\u2019d mistake it as her holding on for dear life, but really Elspeth just wanted to be as close as possible. She tightened her grip even more.</p><p>\u201cEasy, luvvie. Suddenly now you\u2019re afraid of heights?\u201d He chuckled, but rather than pull her loose, he hugged her closer, cradling her with one arm while he used the other to ease them back to the ground. Ducking, he wended his way between branches and out from under the tree.</p><p>She didn\u2019t let go at first, and neither did he. They simply remained silent, until a quizzical expression wrinkled his brow. \u201cYou\u2019re a peculiar wee thing, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Her face fell, and he added quickly, \u201cNot peculiar bad, mind. Simply... peculiar.\u201d</p><p>Time had suspended for her. He stared, and it felt as though he were searching for something, plumbing her depths for some sign, or signal, or meaning.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know what a man like Aidan might seek. All she knew was that despite his dreadful past, in spite of his enigmatic ways and suspicious motives, she trusted him. He could look in her eyes and see what he would, and she\u2019d let him.</p><p>He spoke again, his voice a tentative rasp. \u201cI\u2019ve not met your like before.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNor I yours,\u201d she managed.</p><p>Aidan eased his grip, and she slowly straightened, sliding down his body, savoring the feel of his hard muscle against her soft flesh, of his heat against her quivering limbs, until her feet touched the ground.</p><p>Rather than pull away, she roved purposeful hands down his arms. Though she sensed knots of scarred flesh at her fingertips, she didn\u2019t dare look. Instead, she closed her eyes, slowing her touch, trying to picture those scars in her mind. Such pain had been carved onto his body, a crude and vivid map of his suffering.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m to go away for a time,\u201d she heard him say, and she opened her eyes, realizing she\u2019d stopped moving. He was looking down at her, that intense gaze appearing more intrigued than skeptical now.</p><p>She swallowed. \u201cAway?\u201d</p><p>He smiled, stating simply, \u201cYes. But I\u2019ll be back.\u201d</p><p>She wanted to ask him where he was going, when he\u2019d be back, but she knew such crass, overeager phrases would never cross the lips of a great heroine. A truly bold heroine would ask her man for a kiss, but Elspeth could barely manage to ask him about sheep, much less attempt saucy banter. Instead, what popped from her mouth was \u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>Aidan\u2019s eyes glinted, watching her.</p><p>Oh Lord. That lone word had sounded desperate\u2014she couldn\u2019t imagine what he must think.</p><p>\u201cI mean... when shall we schedule our next lesson?\u201d The question tumbled nervously from her mouth.</p><p>Shrugging, he began to pull away. She wanted to cling to him, to say don\u2019t go. But then he leaned down, and though his voice was playful, the timbre was a low rasp. \u201cYou\u2019re looking forward to teaching me?\u201d</p><p>Heat flamed from her toes to her cheeks. Had she imagined his tone? Had she instilled her own innuendo into a perfectly innocent question? And had he really been looking at her mouth as he asked it? \u201cI ... oh ... yes, of course.\u201d</p><p>He was staring at her mouth. He looked intense, some unspoken battle waging in his expression.</p><p>Oh God, would he kiss her? She wanted to wrap her fingers around his arms, to lean into him and say something coy or sultry, but all she could do was stand stiff and frozen, wishing, hoping, wanting above all things that he\u2019d kiss her.</p><p>The silence was unbearable, and Elspeth turned, needing to look anywhere but at him. \u201cThe sheep. I must go fetch the sheep.\u201d</p><p>Hiking her skirts, she bolted down the hill. If she were a heroine from a novel, she\u2019d have parted her lips. She\u2019d have made him want to kiss her. He wouldn\u2019t be able to think on anything but kissing her.</p><p>But she wasn\u2019t a heroine from a novel. She knew naught of kisses and seduction. She was a poor sheep farmer\u2019s daughter, running from her hero, wishing for all the world that he\u2019d tutor her.</p><p>Aidan strode to the docks, trying not to dwell on how good Elspeth felt in his arms. He\u2019d mistaken her for a wisp of a thing, but she was substantial, her limbs strong and sure from toiling on the land.</p><p>He\u2019d wanted to leave her farm earlier, but damned if she hadn\u2019t gotten herself caught in a tree. Even after he\u2019d helped her down, he\u2019d found himself staying, all thoughts of slavers and subterfuge fallen away. Working with Elspeth was far more satisfying than his intrigues, and he\u2019d wanted to remain as long as he could in her company.</p><p>He\u2019d never felt tied to the land, to Scottish soil\u2014he\u2019d been too young when he was taken, and such thoughts didn\u2019t enter the minds of lads\u2014yet he was finding it oddly invigorating to be working that land, the master of his own day\u2019s labor. To be consulted, to share the work as an equal. And to be sharing it with a woman.</p><p>She\u2019d looked so forlorn at the mention of his departure, her guileless expression so unlike anything any other woman had ever shown him. It\u2019d flooded him with sensations\u2014yearning, comfort, desire, belonging\u2014each feeling so novel, but familiar too, as though he bore the heart of a regular man, as susceptible as any other, his sentiments merely rusted from disuse.</p><p>For a moment, he\u2019d forgotten his pain and his anger. For a moment, all he\u2019d wanted was to kiss her.</p><p>Shaking the thoughts from his head, he boarded his ship, climbing straight up the rigging. It wasn\u2019t good to be back in Aberdeen\u2014the place held too many memories\u2014 but it was good to be back aboard the Journeyman.</p><p>A few months had passed since he\u2019d commandeered the boat and made his escape, yet he still found it hard to view himself as a free man. But back on the water like this, with one shoulder to the endless horizon, he didn\u2019t feel so hemmed in. The rocking waves promised freedom. Feeling the sea\u2019s lurch and roll, Aidan could actually believe he was his own man, unchained and unfettered.</p><p>He\u2019d fallen in love with the boat the moment he\u2019d laid eyes on her. Aidan was no cheat, but he\u2019d felt no qualms about liberating her from Nash, his fool of a master. Caribbean sailors favored one-mast Jamaican sloops, and this craft was no different. Constructed of cedar not oak, Jamaican sloops rode famously faster and lighter in the water.</p><p>When he\u2019d taken her over, the tub had sailed under the name Providential, and as there\u2019d been naught about his life thus far that he considered particularly blessed, he\u2019d changed it at once. Besides, he couldn\u2019t risk being recognized. Even though Nash had run a tin-pot enterprise, new Caribbean money tended to have deep familial roots in unexpected places, and Aidan couldn\u2019t risk questions upon docking back in Scotland.</p><p>He swung his legs over the edge of the crow\u2019s nest, grateful that he\u2019d worn simple breeches in lieu of the Scots breacan feile that still felt foreign on his body. Opening his coat, he fingered the coin pouch tied at his belt. He hoped it\u2019d be enough for his ruse, for it marked all he owned in the world. A sack of gold jealously saved through the years thanks to the largesse of grateful plantation wives.</p><p>Largesse. He scowled and buttoned back up. Its only cost had been his soul.</p><p>He leaned his head back and thought of Elspeth. Hers was a soul miraculously untouched by the world\u2019s vanity and greed.</p><p>What a strange creature his tutor was, but refreshing too. Sincere and artless, like no other woman he\u2019d ever met. Her gentleness was an unexpected balm to his befouled spirit.</p><p>And though she wasn\u2019t what the world would call beautiful, he couldn\u2019t erase the memory of her eyes. He found he woke thinking about that pale blue gaze, flecked with a yellow to match her long, pin-straight hair. The uncommon combination made her resemble one of the fey, somehow both wary and all-knowing.</p><p>She\u2019d felt so lean in his arms, but with a tensile strength too, like the last of some dying breed of bird, fluttering alone through the world. He wondered if her spirit was as fragile as her body looked\u2014he suspected not. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There was a distant commotion on the quay below, and scrubbing a hand over his face, Aidan remembered himself. He was in Aberdeen for one purpose alone, and it wasn\u2019t to ponder some peculiarly bookish farm girl.</p><p>The yeoman. He needed to find the man with the pearl earring, and with no clues to hand, he\u2019d start at the bot-tom, and at the bottom lurked the yeoman.</p><p>Logically, he knew that it wouldn\u2019t be the same strongarm who\u2019d nabbed him from Humphrey Keith\u2019s home so many years past, but even so, he stifled a shudder when he finally tracked the man down in a seedy tavern off Justice Port.</p> <p>Bluebeard\u2019s Ghost was a hole like any other, with all manner of foulness littering the floor, a smoking chimney, and the reek of ale and bodies within. He\u2019d been told merely that the yeoman was \u201cthe bald one,\u201d and he knew the man at once, beefy arms, fat neck, and a pate as shining as a cue ball.</p><p>\u201cI have a boat,\u201d Aidan said, diving straight to the heart of the matter.</p><p>The yeoman put his tankard down and looked up slowly. \u201cBully for you, laddie. Now you\u2019ll be wanting to move along. This here\u2019s a table for men only. Or are you the new alewife?\u201d His table erupted in laughter.</p><p>Aidan had expected just that sort of a response, and smiled wide. \u201cA merry andrew, I see. I look forward to passing your jest along to your boss.\u201d He put an easy hand on his hip, crooking his thumb in his jacket just enough to reveal the sack of coin at his belt. He wasn\u2019t so foolish as to bring his entire savings, but with the help of a bit of sand and some well-situated coin, the bag was full and clinked enough to catch the attention of any criminal worth his salt. \u201cOr should I tell him instead that you stood in the way of new business?\u201d</p><p>The yeoman\u2019s laughing eyes hardened. \u201cYou\u2019re a braw one, coming in here, flashing your wee purse about. What if I\u2019ve a mind just to take it from you?\u201d</p> <p>A dagger appeared in Aidan\u2019s hand and he plunged it hard and fast, stabbing the yeoman\u2019s sleeve to the table before the man realized what was happening. \u201cAnd what if I\u2019ve a mind just to take your hand from you?\u201d</p><p>The yeoman tugged at his arm, but the knife was planted too deeply in the wood. He rested his hands back on the table as though being affixed to pub furniture were an everyday occurrence. \u201cLeave us,\u201d he snapped to his companions.</p><p>The other men scattered. Retrieving his blade, Aidan plopped onto a stool, kicking his feet out in front of him. \u201cAs I was saying before you so unwisely interrupted, I\u2019ve a ship, and I\u2019ve a mind to fill her hold with able-bodied men and have a sail to the Indies.\u201d</p><p>The yeoman fingered the hole in his sleeve, scowling. \u201cAnd what\u2019s this ship to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t play dim with me.\u201d Aidan\u2019s patience was flagging. He knew in his heart the man with the pearl earring was out there somewhere. Plantations in the Indies and Americas were booming, which meant the slave trade was too, and his enemy wouldn\u2019t walk away from such potential profits.</p><p>Assuming he was still alive. But Aidan had spent thirteen long years living for this moment\u2014he refused to entertain the notion that his enemy had up and died on him.</p> <p>No, he\u2019d tease the man out of hiding, and how better to do so than by applying pressure where his enemy would feel it most: on his purse.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re the muscle who gathers the slaves. But I\u2019m not a patient man. I want a fast start out of the gate, and will raise the stakes if it fills my hold the sooner.\u201d It was a game of economics. He\u2019d pose as a big spender, eager for slaves and ready to pay double the current rate.</p><p>The yeoman sucked on his teeth, looking thoughtful. \u201cIf you want to set up a collection, you\u2019ll need to talk to the boss. He\u2019s our benefactor, like. No business happens without his saying so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s his name?\u201d</p><p>The man shrugged. \u201cOur man\u2019s a respectable fellow, see, who don\u2019t like to give his name. By the docks, we just call him the Bishop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd this Bishop, he\u2019s in charge of the whole business?\u201d Though Aidan knew it wasn\u2019t the man he sought, it was one step closer to the man he did.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in charge of the money, and that\u2019s all I need to know.\u201d The yeoman pulled a greasy wad of papers from his breast pocket and riffled through till he found what he was looking for. \u201cHere,\u201d he said, pinning a scribbled address with his beefy finger. \u201cYou can find him here.\u201d</p><p>Aidan felt the yeoman\u2019s eyes on him as he considered the meaningless scrawl he pretended to read.</p> <p>\u201cYou can find it, aye?\u201d the yeoman asked, a hint of insolent humor in his tone.</p><p>Aidan peeled his lips into a snarl and simply grabbed the paper out of the man\u2019s hand. \u201cI can now.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 11</p><p>Elspeth sat alone in the cavernous Dunnottar dining hall with naught to do but fidget. She knew she should\u2019ve waited for Aidan to come to her, but when Anya casually mentioned that her brother had returned from his trip, she couldn\u2019t wait. She had to seek him out.</p><p>I\u2019ve not met your like before. The words had been a constant hum in her head since he\u2019d left a week past. Her body, a constant hum, as she remembered the look in his eyes as they\u2019d lingered on her mouth.</p><p>He\u2019d had a sort of serious aspect, gazing at her with purpose, like he\u2019d wanted to kiss her. Could such a thing be true? Never had a man studied her in such a manner, but then again, she\u2019d never been kissed. What sort of expression did a man get before kissing a woman?</p><p>She nervously adjusted her quill and ink again, shuffling her pile of papers, again. What would he think of her appearing like this on his doorstep? What madness had overtaken her? It was time for another lesson, certainly, but to show up so shamelessly unsolicited?</p><p>Elspeth replayed their moment once more. I\u2019ve not met your like.</p><p>Why had memory infused such simple words with such pretty meaning? Of course he\u2019d never met her like\u2014 she was the awkward and bookish daughter of a poor farmer. He was used to exotic women, who\u2019d wear richly brocaded gowns, draping ropes of gold along their sunkissed skin, with giant gems nestled in lush d\u00e9colletage.</p><p>When she walked away from that silly hanging tree, she\u2019d felt so close to him, like they were connected. But it wasn\u2019t as though he\u2019d really touched her, like a man touched a woman, so why did it feel as though he must have? Truly, she was the only one who\u2019d been doing the touching, roving her hands down his arms like some Jezebel.</p><p>She looked nervously around the dining hall, feeling like a bird who\u2019d had its wings clipped. She could simply leave, though if Aidan\u2019s siblings found him, then they\u2019d surely embark on a search for her.</p><p>Elspeth heard disembodied voices coming down the hallway.</p><p>She needed to fashion some pretext for coming. Fisting her hands in her skirts, she racked her mind for possible excuses.</p><p>\u201cDid I misunderstand?\u201d She smiled coyly. \u201cDid you not say we should meet today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I didn\u2019t make such a suggestion, then more fool I.\u201d Aidan took the room in three great strides, grasping her hands in his. \u201cIt is lovely to see you again, Elspeth. I\u2019ve thought of little else but this moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know where that girl has got to. Hiding like a church mouse. Such a strange creature! Who\u2019s to understand the ways of ... Ah!\u201d Bridget leaned against the doorjamb, sticking her head through the door. She called back over her shoulder, \u201cHere she is.\u201d</p><p>Elspeth sat tall, imagining refinement, poise. She\u2019d be cool and collected.</p><p>Aidan appeared in the doorway, his magnetic presence eclipsing all else around him. Despite her preparations, she knew a dizzying rush. It was so good\u2014and so terrifying\u2014to see him again.</p><p>She\u2019d begun to wonder if she\u2019d imagined his virtues, if Aidan wasn\u2019t really some boor, shorter or stouter than the man in her fantasies. But he wasn\u2019t. He was better than she\u2019d remembered.</p><p>He was tall and strong, and though the tan of his skin had faded, the sun had left behind fine lines at his eyes and mouth. His eyes narrowed on her, looking much like a dashing buccaneer.</p><p>She opened her mouth to speak, but feared she resembled a gasping fish more than a genteel lady, which had been the effect she\u2019d hoped for. She forced words out. \u201cI\u2019m afraid ... it seems ...\u201d</p><p>Aidan swooped past his sister, his expression dark and dour, storming in like a Viking set on plunder. \u201cJust the woman I\u2019d been wishing to see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I misunderst\u2014\u201d Elspeth froze. \u201cMe? You\u2019d been wishing to see ... me?\u201d</p><p>He held a rolled blanket and adjusted the awkward bundle in his arms. \u201cThere\u2019s no lassies hiding under the table, are there?\u201d Kicking a chair away from the table, he sat next to her. \u201cI feel you at my back, girl. You can leave us now.\u201d</p><p>As Bridget scurried from the doorway, Aidan grumbled, \u201cIf Gregor were ever here, he\u2019d realize the only course is to marry that brat off and make her some other man\u2019s virago.\u201d</p><p>Elspeth half gasped, half laughed. She\u2019d always envied Bridget her beauty and bold sass, and it was a pleasure to hear her criticized, even if had come from her brother.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve something to show you,\u201d he said, looking stern. She prepared herself for the worst.</p><p>His bundle began to wriggle, and Elspeth straightened in her chair.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid,\u201d he ordered.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not ...\u201d She hated how he always assumed she was a shrinking miss of a thing. \u201cI\u2019m not scared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He opened the blanket and a tiny puppy burst out, clambering onto the floor.</p><p>Elspeth yelped in surprise. The creature was a blur of bushy black fur, with white and brown spots, and a long narrow nose. It was the most darling sight she\u2019d ever seen, but Aidan mistook her reaction and snatched the pup back off the floor. \u201cHe\u2019s a bit of a mongrel,\u201d he apologized.</p><p>\u201cNo, no! He\u2019s a wonder!\u201d She leaned forward in her chair, dying to stretch a hand to where Aidan held the dog in his arms, but too shy to. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTruly, you think so?\u201d he asked, betraying an unexpected vulnerability.</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d The notion that she\u2019d been the one called upon to offer reassurance warmed her. \u201cBut why on earth do you need a dog?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot why,\u201d he said, sounding gruff once more. \u201cThe question is who. Who on earth needs such a dog.\u201d He nearly threw the pup into her lap. \u201cYou do.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI do?\u201d The animal exploded into movement, skittering tiny paws and claws over her skirts, and she nestled his chest in one hand, petting and soothing him with the other. \u201cHe\u2019s for me?\u201d</p><p>He tossed off her comment. \u201cAnd who else? I certainly don\u2019t need a sheepdog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut ... me?\u201d Something in her chest clenched. Aidan had thought to give her a gift. Then she remembered the shears, recalling this wasn\u2019t the first present from him. Though why he was so gruff and grudging about it, she couldn\u2019t understand. \u201cYou got him for me?\u201d</p><p>His eyes lit on her for a moment, looking quizzical. \u201cYes. For you. We can\u2019t have you managing your flock from the treetops. This beggar will help you drive them to and fro.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d thought of her enough to bring her such a gift. So many emotions filled her, she thought she might burst. How long had it been since anyone else had given her anything? \u201cWhat\u2019s his name?\u201d</p> <p>He shrugged, looking like he could care less. \u201cYou tell me, luvvie.\u201d The pup had grown calm, and Aidan reached over and scruffed him roughly on the head. \u201cJust please, as someone who spent a lifetime being called \u2018boy,\u2019 I beg you not call him \u2018dog.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d never think it.\u201d She rubbed her hand, burning from where his fingers had brushed hers. \u201cHe\u2019s a grand animal in need of a grand name.\u201d She\u2019d have treasured the dog even if he hadn\u2019t been a gift\u2014though the fact that he\u2019d been from Aidan made him all the more precious. \u201cBut where did you find him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have my sources. It\u2019s a long enough road from here to Aberdeen.\u201d He leaned back in his chair, looking satisfied. \u201cThe pup\u2019s mother was of superlative breeding\u2014a sheepdog all the way from Shetland. Until she had the grave misfortune of having her virtue compromised by a terrier.\u201d</p><p>Elspeth laughed. \u201cA terrier?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, mock gravity setting his features. \u201cA terrier.\u201d</p><p>His gruffness was fading, and she loosened in response. Picturing a regal Shetland bitch in coitus with a wee terrier, she laughed again. \u201cOh my. That must\u2019ve been a sight indeed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy thoughts precisely. The rest of the litter was claimed, but as this fellow was the runt, the owner had no use for him.\u201d</p><p>She clutched the dozing pup to her breast. \u201cWell, I do.\u201d</p><p>This woke the dog, restoring his energy at once, and he leaped from her lap onto the floor. Elspeth patted her leg. \u201cCome back! We must name you.\u201d She patted again, but the dog ignored her, too engrossed in sniffing every inch of the dining hall.</p><p>\u201cOh, bother.\u201d Forgetting her shyness, she simply put two fingers in her mouth and blew. The dog\u2019s ears perked up and he ran straight for her. She scooped him back off the floor, and looked up to find Aidan gaping at her. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour infamous whistle. I\u2019d been hoping to hear it, you know.\u201d</p><p>She blushed to her very toes. Ignoring his comment, she held up her new pet to gaze into his eyes. \u201cI shall call him ... Achilles.\u201d</p><p>A laugh burst from Aidan. \u201cAchilles?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes.\u201d She placed the pup in her lap, but he wriggled madly, and finally Elspeth just shooed him free. \u201cAchilles was famously heroic, you know. And peripatetic, just like this fellow.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPeripa... ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe enjoys moving about.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a skeptical look. \u201cAchilles seems a long name to shout about the glen. How about something simpler?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. A real name. Like Duncan.\u201d</p><p>She bit back a disbelieving smile. \u201cDuncan is the name of your nephew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, then,\u201d he said with a dismissive wave of his hand. \u201cWhy not Fergal, or Alasdair, or ...\u201d</p><p>The dog sniffed his way to the corner, and finding a patch of weeds that\u2019d broken through the masonry, squatted and availed himself.</p><p>Aidan laughed again. \u201cPissing in the bloody dining hall. Bridget will be livid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou see? He is Achilles.\u201d Elspeth turned to face him, and this time she was the one to speak with mock stoicism. \u201cHe\u2019s a warrior.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA warrior? Seems to me pissing in corners is something more suited to drunkards in public houses.\u201d He looked back at the puppy, who was enthusiastically flicking bits of rock and weed over where he\u2019d just let his bladder. \u201cNo, this fellow\u2019s a sheepherder, plain and simple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA sheepherder with a white paw.\u201d She pointed to the white hind paw amid three black ones. \u201cJust like Achilles, with his vulnerable heel. You see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, luvvie, I do not see.\u201d</p><p>She turned to face Aidan, realizing he didn\u2019t get the connection. And of course he didn\u2019t. When would he have had the chance ever even to hear about the Greek myths? She knew a flare of regret, but seeing the open curiosity in his expression, she relaxed.</p><p>\u201cWell, there was this man ...\u201d</p><p>As she began to recount her story, Aidan marveled at how she seemed to forget herself, rapt in her own tale. He tried to listen to her words\u2014it was a rousing story, after all\u2014but he found he kept watching her instead, how those pale eyes lit with emotion, how her delicate hands fluttered with expression.</p><p>But the true revelation was her pretty smile. He realized he\u2019d never seen it, not like this. She\u2019d given him polite ones, nervous ones, self-deprecating ones, but never this broad, easy grin telling him that, for just a moment, she\u2019d forgotten herself.</p><p>It was only a squirming, wee mongrel, but the way Elspeth had looked at Aidan, one would\u2019ve thought she\u2019d never before received such a gift. And who knew? Perhaps she hadn\u2019t.</p><p>She finally seemed comfortable with him. His coarse ways had cowed her at first. That he\u2019d finally put her at her ease was nearly as great a triumph as escaping Barbados.</p><p>The dog came sniffing back to them. Aidan saw how Elspeth longed to hold the creature, but as he bent to get the pup for her, she practically jumped out of his way, and her elbow knocked aside the inkpot she\u2019d put out for the day\u2019s lessons.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She clapped a hand to her mouth, and chagrin bled her face of the joy he\u2019d seen just a moment before. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve naught to be sorry for,\u201d he said, dropping to the floor to grab the rolling inkpot.</p><p>Unfortunately, she\u2019d knelt at the same time, and they knocked heads. \u201cOh,\u201d she said again, with a hand to her temple. \u201cSorry. I am so sorry.\u201d</p><p>Anxiety and embarrassment were seeping into her features, and Aidan would have nothing of it. He refused to surrender the contented rapport they\u2019d attained. He snatched up the inkpot and said, \u201cIt\u2019s all my doing, luvvie. I\u2019ll fetch a rag.\u201d</p><p>He raced from the room, and Elspeth was convinced it was to flee the likes of her.</p><p>She plopped onto her bottom. Her hair had come loose, and she brushed a lock from her eyes. Too late, she noticed the black ink smudged along the side of her hand. \u201cFool,\u201d she said, scrubbing at it, but her efforts only served to spread the blot along her fingertips. She was certain she must have ink spread all over her face, too. \u201cYou\u2019re a fool.\u201d</p><p>She sat in silent shame for a moment, then realized there was an odd stillness in the room. She glanced around. \u201cAchilles?\u201d</p><p>Hearing a muffled whimper, she hopped to her feet, pacing the room, calling gently for the dog. She tamped down a surge of panic. Though Dunnottar Castle was clearly inhabitable, there were areas that\u2019d fallen to ruin, piles of rubble in which a tiny pup could get lost or crushed. A high-pitched whine came from the corner.</p><p>\u201cAchilles? Come on, boy. Where are you?\u201d She heard the sound of settling rocks, and this time when the panic flared, Elspeth let it flood her. She ran to the noise, dropping and scrabbling on hands and knees. \u201cAchilles?\u201d</p><p>Spotting a small hole, she squatted low, putting her cheek to the ground just as a tiny black nose sniffed into view. She began to clear rocks away from the hole, but her dog was either too startled or too curious, and he disappeared from view.</p><p>\u201cWhere have you gotten to?\u201d She worked quickly, plucking rocks away, revealing a narrow burrow, low and dark.</p><p>She thought about the layout of the castle. Such a place would likely feature a pit off the dining area\u2014ogling prisoners had once been considered grand entertainment between courses. Was this a passage to a long-forgotten dungeon? The thought didn\u2019t give her comfort\u2014if the pup fell, they\u2019d never be able to pull him out. \u201cGet back here this instant,\u201d she said, her tone distinctly alarmed.</p><p>Elspeth heaved aside a few of the larger rocks and, sweeping away loose bits of masonry, uncovered a hole large enough to crawl through. She didn\u2019t hesitate, just dove in after him. The tunnel soon shrank around her, and she sank onto her belly, slinking forward on her elbows.</p><p>A mass of fur barreled into her. She yelped, and he scampered away again.</p><p>\u201cBlasted pup.\u201d He thought they were playing at some game. \u201cGet here, you rascal.\u201d She patted the ground, reaching an arm before her in the darkness, and seized a fistful of soft puppy. \u201cGotcha.\u201d</p><p>She crept backward, doing her best to hold on to the dog, alternately nipping and licking her. \u201cI should\u2019ve named you Pan, not Achilles, you wee troublemaker. Don\u2019t you know you could get crushed in here? Or you could\u2019ve dropped down the pit, and then where would you be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne could say the same for you,\u201d a decidedly masculine voice replied.</p><p>Aidan. Elspeth dropped her forehead in defeat. He\u2019d seen her embarrassed, helpless, and stuttering ... he might as well see her covered in dust, engulfed to her waist by a hole in the wall. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her heart gave a hot, shamed pounding in her chest as she realized her skirts were surely up around her knees. She held her breath, and sure enough, felt a cool breeze dancing above the cuff of her half boots.</p><p>\u201cIt appears I find you stuck again.\u201d Restrained laughter vibrated in his voice. \u201cI must know: how did you manage before we met?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not stuck. I am merely ... retrieving Achilles.\u201d But she found she couldn\u2019t continue to worm her way back out while keeping hold of the dog.</p> <p>\u201cYou appear to have stopped moving.\u201d His voice was closer now; probably he was squatting down next to her. \u201cMight I be of assistance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ...\u201d She blinked her eyes tight. Yet another instance of dashed dignity. \u201cYes, please,\u201d she said, deflating.</p><p>He grasped her calves, and a bolt of lightning shot straight from his palms, crackling up through her body. His hands seemed to linger overlong on the skin just above her boots, and she wondered distantly if he might not have accomplished the same thing by simply grabbing her booted feet.</p><p>He tugged as gently as the situation permitted, but her knee scraped along the slate floor, and she flinched. \u201cDamn,\u201d he whispered. \u201cA moment.\u201d</p><p>She sensed him move closer. He loomed there, hesitating, and then a hand slid beneath her knees.</p> <p>A foreign sensation exploded to life, buzzing through her body, settling to a hot pulse between her legs. A cry escaped her, and she lost hold of Achilles. \u201cI ... the ...\u201d Elspeth cleared her throat. \u201cI\u2019ve let go the dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelax.\u201d He gave her knee a squeeze, and her stomach flip-flopped. \u201cHe\u2019ll get hungry and come out. Let\u2019s attend to you first,\u201d Aidan said, freeing her the rest of the way.</p><p>She cringed at how she must look\u2014surely she was covered in dirt and crumbled mortar\u2014and dismay alternated with this new yearning she felt in her breast. She tried to blow the dust and hair from her face.</p><p>He rolled her carefully onto her back and brushed the hair from her brow. \u201cHush,\u201d he murmured, even though she hadn\u2019t said anything.</p><p>Their gazes met, and her mind went blank, silly concerns like dust falling away. His eyes were a crisp blue\u2014 not a pale, washed-out shade, but blue like a summer sky.</p><p>Faint lines were etched around them, from where he\u2019d squinted in the sun. Her eyes traced a path down to the matching lines bracketing his mouth. He\u2019d labored in the sun, but her roguish hero had smiled too.</p> <p>He licked his lips, and she couldn\u2019t help but stare at that mouth. Would his kiss be firm or soft? A gentle peck, or deeper? Because she guessed kisses could go deeper.</p><p>She desperately wanted him to kiss her, wanted to find out for herself what he\u2019d feel like, breathing in the very breath from his lungs. But she hadn\u2019t the slightest idea how to go about making a man kiss her. Surely one didn\u2019t just ask. Great heroines communicated their desires with a glance or a gesture.</p><p>Elspeth looked back up at Aidan with widened eyes, imagining illicit things like kisses and touches, but his expression remained an unreadable mask.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t getting her message.</p><p>And so she blinked, then opened her eyes even wider.</p><p>He tilted his head, studying her. \u201cDid you hurt yourself?\u201d</p><p>She cut her eyes down, shaking her head mutely. Only my pride.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, then?\u201d Touching her chin with his finger, he tilted her face so that she couldn\u2019t help but look at him. His hands and fingers handled her so deftly. He was nothing short of a pirate king\u2014of course he wouldn\u2019t be swayed by a farm girl\u2019s clumsy attempts at seduction.</p> <p>But the expression that met hers was so somber, so gentle, Elspeth found herself confessing, \u201cI feel such a fool sometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA fool?\u201d He smoothed hair from her brow. \u201cSilly Beth. Not a fool. Never a fool.\u201d</p><p>Beth. He\u2019d called her Beth.</p><p>Nobody had ever called her by that name, or by any other name aside from Elspeth, for that matter. But with Aidan, she\u2019d been \u201cluvvie,\u201d and now she was \u201cBeth.\u201d Such a simple little syllable, and yet, in that instant, it\u2019d become the most precious she\u2019d ever known.</p><p>\u201cAye, you\u2019re a fool for books.\u201d He added with a chuckle, \u201cI daresay, you already seem a fool for that ridiculous scrap of a mutt.\u201d He leaned gradually closer as he spoke, voice slowing, eyes growing hooded. \u201cA fool for that flock of idiot sheep, mayhap.\u201d</p><p>She held her breath, wondering what was happening. Her body was in chaos, her every sense attuned to this man, so close she could smell the scent of his person, near enough to see the texture of his skin.</p><p>He paused for a moment, and when he spoke again, there was a hard edge to his voice. \u201cA fool, certainly, to put up with a father who doesn\u2019t appear to recognize your worth.\u201d</p><p>But then, with a sharp inhale, he softened just as quickly. \u201cBut a fool, plain and simple? Not that. Not you.\u201d</p><p>His movements slowed\u2014time slowed\u2014as he leaned even closer. She felt his breath warm on her face. Her lips parted on a gasp. Could this be what she thought it might be? Would he finally kiss her? She\u2019d sacrifice everything just for one kiss from Aidan.</p><p>She shut her eyes, ready, hoping, desperate to be swept away.</p><p>But instead of his touch, there came a loud scrabbling sound, followed quickly by the rollick of paws of an eager and dusty puppy. Aidan rolled away with an amused curse.</p><p>Elspeth fended off the dog\u2019s enthusiastic licks. \u201cAchilles, you beast,\u201d she scolded, thinking ruefully that it was far from the kiss she\u2019d been hoping for.</p><p>Chapter 12</p><p>\u201cAre you certain?\u201d Aidan asked, standing at the threshold of her cottage. When Elspeth proposed that they meet so late in the afternoon, the idea had seemed a fine one. But something had happened the day he gave her that damned puppy, and suddenly this meeting felt entirely improper. He looked back over his shoulder. \u201cDusk will be here soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m certain.\u201d Stepping aside from the door, she invited him in. When Achilles galloped to fill her place, Elspeth laughed, and it speared him. It was the same bright, feminine giggle that\u2019d erupted from her when he\u2019d given her the dog, and he realized he\u2019d been longing to hear it again. It was an open and joyful sound, especially sweet since she was so often such a still and quiet creature.</p><p>His eyes went to her lips, still curved in a careless, artless smile. She was staring at Achilles, and Aidan had the absurd thought that someday she might stare at him with just such a smile.</p><p>Her eyes met his, and they shone with happiness. An impulse seized him, to pull her close into his arms and kiss those gentle lips until her laughter made him forget himself. Until he found himself laughing with her.</p><p>\u201cYou see, I\u2019ve my new dog to protect me.\u201d</p><p>The moment ended as he thought of another of her selfappointed protectors. \u201cWhat of your father?\u201d He stepped inside, looking to the right and left. Aidan had only met him a handful of times, and the man had eyed him with varying degrees of distrust and distaste. Not that it mattered\u2014he\u2019d been predisposed to dislike the old cadger once he got wind of how the man handled his farm, his business, and his daughter.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not here tonight,\u201d she said.</p><p>It seemed Farquharson spent more time enjoying the taverns of Aberdeenshire than he did the company of his only daughter.</p><p>Elspeth was watching him carefully, and he realized he must\u2019ve been scowling. Not wanting to offend, he smoothed his face. Her father was away\u2014again\u2014but he supposed it was just as well. From now on, they\u2019d do their tutoring when Aidan\u2019s workday was through, and it\u2019d be best not to have the old man lurking about all the time anyway. \u201cThere\u2019s no other time,\u201d he said, thinking out loud.</p><p>Her face fell, looking puzzled. \u201cYou don\u2019t have the time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo ... I mean, yes ... I do have the time.\u201d He raked a hand through his hair, starting over. She seemed so nervous all of a sudden, it was making him agitated, too. \u201cWhat I mean to say is, there aren\u2019t enough hours in the day, so doing our lessons after work is a good plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, good, yes.\u201d Her shoulders seemed to slacken in relief. \u201cWe\u2019ll be done long before the sun sets.\u201d</p><p>She said nothing after that, and instead bustled about, fetching him a cup of milk, and so he pulled a stool to their usual spot by the fire. \u201cTell me, teacher,\u201d he said, trying to put her at ease, \u201cwhat\u2019s on the docket?\u201d</p><p>It was a simple question, but the woman seemed to have been struck dumb. For a moment, she stared at him, and his world hung suspended, with only the incessant bleating of the sheep filling the still air. \u201cThe docket?\u201d she asked uncertainly.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t tell me you\u2019ve decided I\u2019m beyond hope, and you\u2019re of a mind to send me away.\u201d He\u2019d tossed off his words playfully, but deep down he feared perhaps she might consider him a hopeless case. It was a strangely disquieting thought.</p><p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d she said quickly. \u201cYou\u2019ve gotten quite good, actually. I was thinking to have you do the reading tonight.\u201d For some reason, this pronouncement had pink blooming in her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cIf you think I have it in me,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOh, you do have it in you.\u201d The pink in her cheeks turned to red. \u201cTo read. You have it in you to read.\u201d</p><p>He studied her, feeling his lips part in a smile. He\u2019d give anything to know the thoughts that danced through her mind to make the woman blush so. \u201cWhat am I to read, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoetry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoetry?\u201d He wondered if their somewhat indecorous interlude on the floor of the Dunnottar dining hall might not just have her feeling a bit daring. \u201cHow ... audacious.\u201d</p><p>Elspeth dropped her jaw, looking short of breath, and a realization floored him. He\u2019d been on the mark: the woman was feeling bold. Why else would she look like a cat caught in the cream?</p><p>Usually, such a revelation would have an easy laugh rolling from him. This time, though, he found himself mute, feeling as uncertain as a lad in leading strings. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDo you not like poetry?\u201d she asked, sounding fretful.</p><p>\u201cI like poetry just fine.\u201d He forced a jaunty smile.</p><p>\u201cThough, generally, the verses one hears aboard ship or in the fields aren\u2019t suitable for a lady.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d be curious to hear those.\u201d A strange tremor energized her voice, but she turned her back to him so quickly, for an instant, he doubted he\u2019d heard correctly.</p><p>Heat shot into his groin, and he adjusted himself, leaning forward, elbows on knees. It seemed this Elspeth might indeed enjoy having a bit of wickedness whispered in her ears. \u201cWhat a strange girl you are.\u201d</p><p>She stilled. \u201cDid I do something wrong?\u201d</p><p>He studied the line of her back, the long neck, straight shoulders, and slender torso that tapered down to a small waist. He\u2019d thought she was a scrawny bird, but given this opportunity to stare unabashedly, he discerned curves hidden under her layers of linen. She was simply taut from her labors, leaner than the plush bodies he\u2019d known in the Indies. \u201cNo, luvvie, I find you do things very right.\u201d</p><p>He watched, mesmerized, as she began to drag a stool beneath a high shelf. Realizing what she was about, he hopped up to assist her.</p> <p>\u201cHave a care.\u201d He came up from behind, catching her around the waist just as she scrambled atop the rickety stool. \u201cIt appears I must remember your penchant for climbing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I do this all the time.\u201d She held still a moment, waiting for the stool\u2019s three legs to steady.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cIf ever I get you on board ship, I\u2019ll have to remain on my guard.\u201d</p><p>She looked down at him, wide-eyed. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI fear you\u2019d catch sight of the crow\u2019s nest, and be up the mast in a jiff.\u201d He laughed, partly because of her innocence, and partly because her waist felt so good in his hands. Standing so close, the scent of her filled him, like grass and soap and bread. Like home.</p><p>\u201cHow I\u2019d adore climbing high into the sails,\u201d she said with a sigh.</p> <p>\u201cI believe you would.\u201d He\u2019d give his last coin to see such a thing.</p><p>She stared dreamily into space, a look of bliss on her face. Was that how she\u2019d look after a kiss?</p><p>His own thought startled him, but then he let himself sit with the notion. His eyes lingered on her mouth. There was a gentle curve to her lips that struck him as eminently kissable. She was so gentle, would she rouse to a man\u2019s touch? Would her awkwardness dissolve in passion?</p><p>She was lean in his hands, but not angular, and there was something pleasant in the feel of her\u2014her figure speaking to work and vitality, rather than the artful layers of skirts and adornment of the plantation women. Surely he wasn\u2019t the only man in Aberdeenshire to see her charms.</p><p>Had Elspeth ever been courted? But she was such a shy piece, and even if she weren\u2019t, what man was in her life even to provide an opportunity? Angus, the neighboring farmer, came to mind.</p><p>At the picture of the brawny, silent bachelor, Aidan bristled. He told himself it wasn\u2019t jealousy that made his chest clench so.</p><p>He cleared his throat, in an effort to clear his mind, and nodded to the shelves. \u201cAre you meaning to fetch something, or shall we do our lessons from here?\u201d Giving her waist a squeeze, he added, \u201cBecause I find I\u2019m enjoying this particular vantage.\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks went pink, and he sidled unnecessarily closer. He was becoming quite fond of those blushes.</p> <p>Reaching high, she plucked a tin from the top shelf. Her body shifted in his hands, and the slide of fabric over firm flesh roused him.</p><p>He swallowed a curse. What kind of base rogue was he that he grew excited over a woman reaching for a tin of flour?</p><p>He guided her as she stepped down from the stool, her tin in hand. \u201cWait,\u201d he said, coming back to himself. \u201cFlour? I thought we were reading.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s where I keep my book.\u201d Something wicked glimmered in her eyes, making him wonder again what sort of thoughts might be dancing through her mind.</p><p>There were, it seemed, many mysteries surrounding the quiet Elspeth. He glanced at the lump of cloth in her hand. \u201cYou store your books in flour?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, just my sonnets.\u201d She patted the fabric, sending a cloud of flour in the air. \u201cIt\u2019d do no good for my father to find them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou provocative little thing,\u201d he said, raising a brow. \u201cPoems that you keep secret from your father? That\u2019s not a book of sailors\u2019 verse, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShakespeare.\u201d She unfolded the cloth, revealing a tiny leather-bound book, trying\u2014and failing\u2014to subdue a proud grin.</p><p>They went to sit in their usual spots, and she opened the book at once, flipping through to a particular spot. \u201cI thought ... this sonnet ... Sonnet 29 ... put me in mind of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf me?\u201d He gave her a wink. \u201cIs it a love poem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d She turned red as a beet, as he knew she would. Teasing color into her cheeks was becoming a most diverting pastime. \u201cThey aren\u2019t love poems. Well, some are love poems, yes. Many. Many are love poems.\u201d She flipped through the pages, looking agitated. \u201cThey\u2019re varied.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe easy, Beth.\u201d He put out his hand. \u201cI\u2019m curious to read it.\u201d</p><p>He began eagerly, but it was slow going, this sonnet, and by its midpoint, his voice had grown cold, his recitation suspicious. This was the poem that reminded her of him? It seemed a cursed ode to misfortune and envy.</p><p>When in disgrace with fortune and men\u2019s eyes,</p><p>I all alone beweep my outcast state,</p><p>And trouble deaf Heaven with my bootless cries,</p><p>And look upon myself, and curse my fate ...</p><p>He glanced up to challenge her choice, but when he did, he saw that she was listening to him with her eyes shut. She held her head canted at a slight angle, as though attuned to some whispering angel only she could hear.</p><p>The picture of her held his stare. Though her skin was luminous and pale as porcelain, that wasn\u2019t what appealed to him. She was always so serene, and now she was doubly so, sitting and savoring her sonnet. After his long years of barbaric captivity, he longed to be near such gentleness, such quiet reserve. It was like entering a warm and tranquil pool after spending an eternity pummeled by hostile tides.</p><p>With Elspeth near, his rage abated, leaving him calm to his very soul. He\u2019d always been restless\u2014even as a young lad\u2014but she was so peaceful, her presence was a balm, soothing him, melting his agitation and resentment, leaving peace in its wake.</p><p>What contentment a man might find, coming home every night to such a woman. What a loving wife she\u2019d make someone, someday. Would she raise her children with such equanimity, such patience?</p><p>She opened her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m sorry ... do you need help? Shall I sound a word?\u201d</p><p>He tensed. He\u2019d almost forgotten\u2014he was the illiterate outsider. Loving wives and contented homes weren\u2019t in the stars for men like him.</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer her, and so she pressed, \u201cAidan, why did you stop?\u201d</p><p>He stopped because it was a damned cruel poem that hit too close to the mark. He stopped because Elspeth had the knack for seeing clear to his blackened heart, when all he\u2019d wanted to do was keep it hidden away forever.</p><p>He skimmed ahead, taking in such lyrical nonsense as larks, and daybreak, and love. Sweet poetry wasn\u2019t for one like him. Sweet girls either. He snapped the book shut. \u201cThis is foolishness. I\u2019m not sentimental.\u201d</p><p>She sat for a time, contemplating him. Just as his discomfort was becoming unbearable, she told him quietly, \u201cOn the contrary. I have the feeling you\u2019re quite sentimental.\u201d</p><p>Her kindness threw him. He shoved the book at her. \u201cBeweep? Good Lord, woman, is this how you understand me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t misunderstand.\u201d She opened the book, flipping back to the page. \u201cMay I?\u201d she asked gently.</p><p>He gave her a brusque shrug.</p><p>She reread the sonnet from the beginning, and he heard with chagrin the poet\u2019s wish that he were like other men, with as much hope, as many friends. As much freedom.</p><p>Only this time, Elspeth read to the end, in which the poet finds somebody to think on, someone to lift him from melancholy. The final line lingered loudly in the stillness of her cottage. \u201cThat then I scorn to change my state with kings.\u201d</p><p>They sat there in the glaring silence, and he watched her, but she stared only at the page before her, as if she dared not glance elsewhere.</p><p>Elspeth. He felt the muscles in his jaw loosen, and knew an ease in his chest. Ever guileless was this Elspeth. He\u2019d misread her skittish nature. Because, in her heart, she was unafraid. And unafraid of him.</p><p>For the first time in his life, he could almost imagine how indeed a man might come to forsake a kingdom for love of another.</p><p>Chapter 13</p><p>A knock on the door startled her. Elspeth blew wisps of hair from her brow, frowning at her rolled-up sleeves and her apron covered in a fine dusting of flour. Visitors were rare, and she glanced from the bread she was kneading to the door, as if that could tell her who stood on the other side.</p><p>Because, though it was early yet, she had a wild hope it might be Aidan.</p><p>\u201cCome in?\u201d she announced, though it came out sounding more like a question than an invitation.</p><p>The door opened, and it was him.</p><p>\u201cAidan,\u201d she said, instantly regretting the oddly chirping sound to her voice. She pasted what she hoped resembled a composed smile on her face.</p><p>He stepped inside, filling the cottage as was his wont, making it seem so small in comparison with his powerful frame. He touched a hand to his brow as if tipping an imaginary hat. \u201cMorning.\u201d</p><p>Nerves seized her. Aidan never came to see her during the day. Had he decided he was done with their arrangement? Had her father found him and said something horrible? \u201cIs there a problem?\u201d</p><p>He scanned the room, and she had the odd thought that he might not know why he was there either. But then he said, \u201cNo problem at all, luvvie. I simply find myself...\u201d He got a peculiar look in his eye. Tilting his head, he walked toward her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She held her breath.</p><p>\u201cI find myself ... in need of a kiss. I find myself ... unable to work a moment longer without seeing you, my dearest darling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI find myself parched, and came to see if you might spare a poor laborer one of those cups of milk you seem always to have at hand. But first\u2014\u201d He stopped just in front of her, a warm smile quirking his lips. \u201cYou have a bit of flour on your ...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh!\u201d Her apron was a frightful mess, so her hair and face must\u2019ve been so too. Horrified, she clapped a hand to her cheek. Unfortunately, the cloud of flour told her she\u2019d just mussed herself up even more.</p><p>\u201cOn your nose,\u201d he finished, with a low chuckle. \u201cHere, I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d He raised a hand just as she did, and they knocked into each other.</p><p>She flinched back. \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got it,\u201d he said definitively, wrapping one firm, warm hand over hers while he used the other to smudge her nose and cheek.</p><p>\u201cTh-thank you.\u201d She stared up at him, and her mind went blank. His skin was weathered from the sun, and it made him seem so masculine. So unlike the pale Aberdeen fops in their velvet waistcoats and polished boots. Aidan might not have been a nobleman, but he was a man.</p> <p>He pinched her chin. \u201cThe milk, luvvie? Hauling stone builds a powerful thirst.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! Milk! Of course.\u201d She clapped the last of the flour from her hands and went to the small pitcher they kept in a shadowy corner. \u201cIt\u2019s fresh, just a couple hours old,\u201d she told him, pouring him a small glass. Doubt froze her. \u201cUnless you might like it warmed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever you worry,\u201d he said easily, taking it from her. \u201cCool is best for a working man.\u201d</p><p>He gulped it down and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. \u201cI came this morning, thinking to check on Achilles, but he found me instead. The pup\u2019s spent the past hour nipping my heels. He\u2019ll be more tired than I by the end of the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s because we\u2019re fond of you.\u201d She smiled, but it froze on her face. What had she just said? \u201cHe. I meant, he\u2019s fond of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you not fond of me too?\u201d He handed the cup back to her with a wink.</p> <p>He\u2019d only been playing, but still, her heart stopped in her chest. Was this what it was to flirt with a man? She floundered for words, fretting about what secrets her blush might be betraying.</p><p>Aidan gave her a peculiar smile, then, to her everlasting gratitude, changed the subject. \u201cWeeks at sea, I\u2019d forgotten how it is to have a dog trailing about.\u201d</p><p>He seemed so comfortable working her farm, she\u2019d forgotten he\u2019d be just as at home on a ship. She\u2019d never been able to muster insipid chat like other women, and found an unusual question spring to her tongue. \u201cWas it grand, the sea?\u201d</p><p>He considered her with an inscrutable look on his face, and she worried she might have offended him somehow. Was it possible that nobody had yet asked him\u2014truly asked him\u2014about his experiences? But considering the other MacAlpins, she saw how that might\u2019ve been the case.</p><p>Bridget wouldn\u2019t have thought of it, Anya wouldn\u2019t have dared, Gregor would\u2019ve been too busy, Declan too preoccupied, and Cormac too caught up in Marjorie\u2019s pregnancy to have thought of much beyond himself and his new wife.</p><p>Aidan surprised her when, his features softening, he pulled up a stool and sat. \u201cAye, Beth,\u201d he said, a faraway look in his eyes. \u201cThe sea was grand indeed. It scares some men. But confinement has always struck me as more frightful than any death.\u201d</p><p>She sucked in a sharp breath. \u201cYour days in captivity must\u2019ve been horrible for you. More than horrible,\u201d she amended, cursing the impotence of her words.</p><p>\u201cAye, horrible.\u201d The word rolled on his tongue, as though he were testing it. The expression on his face said he found it wanting. Even though he shrugged, she could see the ghost of his pain in his tight brow and clenched teeth.</p> <p>\u201cFor years I felt trapped\u2014was trapped.\u201d Putting his elbows on the butcher-block table, he leaned closer, as though anxious for her to understand. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t just that I couldn\u2019t escape. I was ... hemmed in. By day, it was the other workers, and the cane, and the heat, closing in around me till I felt I couldn\u2019t breathe. But nights were the worst. Once my body stopped moving, the thoughts took over ...\u201d</p><p>Anguish swept his features, and he checked it just as quickly, with just a single twitch of his lip speaking to his pain.</p><p>\u201cWhat thoughts you must\u2019ve had,\u201d she said somberly. \u201cYou must\u2019ve been so terribly heartbroken, thinking of your family. And terrified\u2014you were just a boy. How you must have longed for home. And for revenge.\u201d</p><p>His eyes brightened. \u201cAye. All those things. I\u2019d spend my nights in such dark reveries, too exhausted to sleep, surrounded by men who chattered on and on. On through the night, till I believed never would I know silence, never stillness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo have been plunged into such a nightmare as a mere boy. It\u2019s unthinkable.\u201d She imagined how it would be, to spend one\u2019s days laboring, surrounded by men\u2014and among such as those who\u2019d find themselves indentured on a faraway island. Aidan was intelligent and thoughtful. He\u2019d not have found a like-minded soul among them.</p><p>She sighed. Despite the weight of his memories, she\u2019d willingly share every one. \u201cMy own days are spent alone. Well,\u201d she amended with a rueful laugh, \u201calone but for the sheep. And I can\u2019t imagine it differently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, sheep would\u2019ve been preferable.\u201d He caught her eye, and it seemed to her that his brow had smoothed a fraction. \u201cSo you see, I longed for peace ... until I first climbed to the top of my ship\u2019s rigging. There I found naught but the sea for miles all around, the only sound the creak of the lines and the slap of the waves. And me, my own man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow exhilarating.\u201d She gave him a wistful smile, wishing she might one day have her own adventure, knowing at the same time she\u2019d only find it in the pages of a book.</p><p>\u201cAye, Beth.\u201d He looked blindly in the distance, savoring the memory, and then snapped back, with a rakish wink. \u201cThe only thing grander was the escape itself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you tell me of it?\u201d She was desperate to hear how he\u2019d broken free. Desperate to hear all his tales ... were there pirates, and sea monsters, and storms? She snatched at the first detail that flitted across her imagination. \u201cDo men really sing on the open sea?\u201d</p><p>He gave her a startled smile. \u201cDo they sing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean,\u201d she said, feeling her cheeks color, \u201cis it like the books? With pirates singing sea-shanties, and men crying the oars?\u201d</p><p>He stared at her, an unreadable look in his eyes. \u201cA bit, I suppose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do so long for a sail someday.\u201d She drifted for a moment, thinking how she\u2019d stand at the railing, shading her eyes from the sun. Aidan would come stand beside her. He\u2019d wrap his strong arm around her shoulders. The heat of him would warm her, shielding her from the chill winds whipping off the sea.</p><p>\u201cIt would be dangerous for a woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she protested at once, enthusiastically quoting the old proverb \u201cDanger and delight grow on one stalk!\u201d</p><p>Chuckling, he kicked his legs out and relaxed against the table. \u201cI\u2019ve told you before, Beth, you\u2019re an odd one. But I daresay, I like it.\u201d</p><p>She thought she might burst from the joy in her chest. Never would she have thought being called odd would be so distinctly wonderful.</p><p>She wanted to hear more\u2014she could listen all night to that resonant voice, telling swashbuckling tales. \u201cWould you tell me a sea story?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA story of the sea?\u201d Spying Elspeth\u2019s intense attention, he gave a low laugh. \u201cIf you\u2019re longing for tales of serpents, or Arabian pirates bearing silks and scimitars, you\u2019re to be sorely disappointed. Truly, once we got under way, I mostly spent my days wondering what I might find when I arrived.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019d been many years since you\u2019d been home,\u201d she murmured, speaking her thoughts aloud. Acquainted with the MacAlpins, she\u2019d thought of Aidan as a Scots-man. But really, his country and his family would\u2019ve been strange to him. It must\u2019ve been unsettling to sail for home, not knowing what or whom he\u2019d find. \u201cYou must\u2019ve wondered what\u2019d come of your family, of Scotland. I\u2019ve always wished for siblings, but I imagine it must\u2019ve been daunting indeed to return to a castle full of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d he said, his voice tight.</p><p>The sound of it tugged at her heart. Aidan was surely concealing a riot of emotion in that strapping chest of his.</p><p>\u201cWere you afraid what you might find?\u201d</p><p>He seemed amused by the question. \u201cAfraid? I can\u2019t think of a thing I\u2019ve not yet seen, nor yet endured, that might frighten me.\u201d</p><p>She leaned her hip against her worktable, completely enthralled. \u201cWell, surely you were excited.\u201d</p><p>He gave it some thought. \u201cNot excited, precisely. More like there was a fire in my blood. A hunger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA hunger for what?\u201d she asked quietly, risking the question foremost on her mind. \u201cWhat had you missed most?\u201d</p><p>Again, she spied that pained expression. It flickered quickly and then disappeared, replaced by Aidan\u2019s dis-missive good humor.</p><p>\u201cYou ask of hunger. I daresay, that\u2019s what I missed most.\u201d He shot a lighthearted glance toward the ball of dough on the butcher-block table.</p><p>\u201cBread?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes, I suppose that. But I mean ...\u201d He gave a boyish shrug. \u201cI missed food. Real food, good food, the kind my mother would make.\u201d</p><p>She froze, holding utterly still, despite having one hand knuckle-deep in bread dough. Her rogue had been young and happy once. Vulnerable, needful, and joyous. Was that person still to be found somewhere in his heart?</p><p>She didn\u2019t want anything to make him think twice about continuing with this amazing confession, and her voice came out a near whisper. \u201cWhat would she make you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell, I remember one thing.\u201d He chuckled, his gaze looking to someplace faraway. \u201cShe\u2019d call it her Whim-Wham Pudding. I adored it. Lord, how sweet it was, made with sugar and wee currants. But \u2019twas filling too\u2014thick, like a meal.\u201d</p><p>The sound of her father\u2019s shouts brought them back to the moment. Her heart thudded to the floor. All she wanted was to sit there forever, listening to Aidan, knowing him.</p><p>He must\u2019ve read something in her expression, because when their eyes connected, she fantasized that his carried a message. She read an apology, for her situation, and a question too.</p> <p>Aidan\u2019s real question, when voiced, was unexpected. \u201cWhat does he do all day?\u201d</p><p>She stood upright, resuming her kneading. \u201cWho? Da?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here, and I see you doing woman\u2019s work,\u201d he said, with a nod to her bread dough. \u201cYet I see you doing man\u2019s work too, minding the accounts, tending the animals.\u201d</p><p>She wiped a sleeve across her brow, then continued with the bread. \u201cI\u2019m cannier with numbers. And he\u2019s too old to be mucking about in the pasture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p> <p>She could no longer meet his eyes. \u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, what does he do?\u201d He reached across the table and stilled her with a gentle hand on her wrist. \u201cMuch more of that kneading, luvvie, and you\u2019ll be serving hardtack not biscuits for dinner.\u201d</p><p>She pulled her hands free, smudging the excess dough from her fingers. \u201cThere are just the two of us,\u201d she said, bristling. But even as she said it, she wondered why she defended her father so unquestioningly. Trying to convince herself as much as Aidan, she explained, \u201cI\u2019ve had to be responsible for things a woman generally isn\u2019t. But he does things a woman could never do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike traveling to Aberdeen. He does a fair bit of that, setting up the new business. He visits neighboring farms, arranging trade.\u201d</p><p>But the seeds of doubt had been planted. Did he really need to spend that much time on these so-called business relationships? It wasn\u2019t as though his efforts bore great fruit.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve fashed you,\u201d Aidan said, misunderstanding her frown. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sorry for it.\u201d</p><p>She tuned into her father\u2019s voice, growing closer and louder, singing in the way he did after a good mug or three of ale. It\u2019d been just the two of them for so long, it wasn\u2019t until she\u2019d seen their relationship through Aidan\u2019s eyes that she felt there was anything wanting.</p><p>And though she knew her da loved her, she\u2019d never felt truly taken care of. She\u2019d been the one who always cared for him. She\u2019d done all the fretting and the tending, as though their roles were reversed and she were the parent and he the child.</p><p>\u201cYour mind is elsewhere, and I\u2019ve overstayed.\u201d Aidan stood. He hesitated for a moment, and then giving her a gentle smile, he reached across the table to sweep his thumb across her cheekbone. \u201cNext time, put more flour in your bread, and less on your pretty self, aye?\u201d</p><p>She watched his back as he walked to her door, feeling as though her heart had been skewered through. Because somehow, since she\u2019d met Aidan, she\u2019d begun to feel worthy of someone else\u2019s tending. With a single smudge of his thumb on her cheek, she felt cared for.</p><p>Aidan left as her father entered, and the two men exchanged polite but chilly nods.</p><p>Her father strode to the fire, stoking it to life. Glancing at the dough, he asked, \u201cAre we finally to have bread with dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Da.\u201d Elspeth smiled to herself, making a decision. Wiping off her hands, she walked to the cupboard, retrieving a small packet of dried currants. \u201cBread pudding.\u201d</p> <p>She held the spoon, and he took it into his mouth, shutting his eyes with a moan. \u201cHow did you know I longed for pudding?\u201d</p><p>It was a perfect mouth, his full lips framed by a strong jaw. Putting the spoon down, she used her fingertip to dab a bit of pudding from the corner. \u201cI just knew,\u201d she said, her sultry tone implying so much more.</p><p>His eyes met hers, energy snapping between them. And then, turning his face into her hand, he sucked her finger between those perfect lips.</p><p>\u201cOh dear,\u201d she murmured, her hip collapsing against the table.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Her father came over to peer at her workspace. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you used all the flour again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Da, not that.\u201d She bit her lip, feeling wicked. \u201cIt\u2019s simply gotten warm here by the fire.\u201d</p><p>Uninterested in domestic activities, her father found an excuse to leave, and Elspeth welcomed the opportunity to work the rest of the day by herself. By late afternoon, she had a supper plate set for him, and was out the door and on her way to Dunnottar, carrying a bowl of pudding, still warm from the oven.</p><p>By the time she arrived at the old guardhouse Aidan called home, the sky was slate gray with coming twilight. A faint halo of golden light shone in his window, speaking to a lone candle flickering inside. Her arms were tired from holding the awkward delivery during so long a walk, and Elspeth carefully balanced the bowl on her hip to knock.</p><p>The door opened abruptly, and Aidan studied her for a moment, looking baffled. As he fully registered her appearance, his puzzlement turned to concern. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d Stiffening, he asked in a louder voice, \u201cDid he do something to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe?\u201d She shifted the bowl to her other hand, giving a quick shake to her arm. \u201cOh, Da? Losh, no. He\u2019d never hurt me.\u201d Smiling, she proffered the bowl. \u201cI made you something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou made me something?\u201d His anxiety flashed into anger. Placing a hand on the doorjamb, he leaned out over her shoulder, scanning the grounds behind her as though she might have been followed by a mob of angry criminals.</p><p>His eyes flew back to her. \u201cWhat are you thinking, coming here alone? And for this?\u201d He gave her bowl a disparaging glance. \u201cIt\u2019s growing dark. You could\u2019ve fallen on the road. Or worse.\u201d</p><p>She felt a queer churning in her belly as her heart fell and her gorge rose. Summoning a pride she didn\u2019t feel, she said, \u201cI am my own person, Aidan MacAlpin. I went where I would before I met you, and shall go where I will long after you\u2019re gone.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her, his expression hard. He still didn\u2019t move to take the pudding, so she bent and put it on the ground outside his door.</p><p>Swallowing against the ache in her throat, she turned to go. \u201cIt\u2019s bread pudding,\u201d she said from over her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d he called, after she\u2019d gone a few paces.</p><p>Though she stopped, she felt a tear running hot down her cheek, and the shame of it prevented her from turning back to face him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere,\u201d he said.</p><p>What could he have possibly meant by that? There might\u2019ve been an apology in the words, but she was uncertain. She risked a quick scrub of her cheeks with her hand, dreading the thought he might realize she\u2019d let a few tears spill.</p><p>She heard him step closer. \u201cAnd though it may be true that you once gadded about the countryside with no one to say otherwise, the fact is, I am here now, and I\u2019d ask that you cease your gadding, particularly after dark.\u201d She sensed movement at her back, then felt a warm hand on her shoulder. \u201cPuts a man on edge,\u201d he added, with humor in his voice.</p><p>She sniffled, protesting with a weak laugh, \u201cIt\u2019s not dark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it soon will be. I\u2019ll put on my boots and walk you home.\u201d</p><p>Her shoulders slumped. He was going to send her home. \u201cOh,\u201d she said, in a small voice.</p><p>\u201cNo need to fret. I promise you\u2019ll be safe from me in the dark.\u201d</p><p>She raised her head, meeting his gaze to tell him he\u2019d misunderstood, but his eyes held a playful gleam. Her inner heroine wanted to respond, Not too safe, I hope.</p><p>He snatched up the bowl, casting a longing look at its contents. \u201cI\u2019ve not had pudding in... as long as I can remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She remembered her last fantasy of him and nearly choked. Clearing her throat, she said, \u201cAre you certain you won\u2019t ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave a bite?\u201d He stirred it with the spoon she\u2019d brought. \u201cI suppose there\u2019s no harm in having just a bite before we leave.\u201d</p><p>Relaxing at last, she gave him a warm smile.</p><p>He pinched her chin. \u201cWee Beth. Always with a thought for others before yourself, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just thought you might like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou thought correctly.\u201d He went back inside and plopped onto the room\u2019s only stool. When she glanced around nervously, he gestured to the edge of the bed. \u201cNo need to cling to manners here. Sit yourself down.\u201d His anger was gone now, and he nodded enthusiastically at the bowl in his hands. \u201cI can tell by the feel, this will take me but a moment to dispatch.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cShould I have brought more?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, you should have.\u201d He dug in for his first bite and sighed. \u201cDelicious,\u201d he said, swallowing a mouthful. \u201cA man can never have enough pudding.\u201d He grew silent then, polishing the bowl off as quickly as he\u2019d promised.</p><p>She watched his lips, mesmerized, as he savored each bite. He seemed to revel in it, offering an occasional nod or moan, his reaction better than anything she could\u2019ve conjured in her own mind.</p><p>She was more certain than ever that she wanted to kiss that mouth.</p><p>He was at home in his room, paying attention to nothing but that bowl of pudding, and she drank in his every detail. How he casually leaned against the wall, and the way the stones at his back tugged his shirt tight against his body.</p><p>She\u2019d stroke her fingers along his neck, down to the triangle of skin that peeked through the V of his collar. It would be smooth and tanned.</p><p>She\u2019d slip off his shirt. Her arms would wrap around him in an embrace. He\u2019d tense when her fingers touched the scars on his back, but she\u2019d tell him she loved him, and kiss him, and blot those scars from his memory.</p><p>He liked her food, a simple fact that gave her a delight she\u2019d never known before. She\u2019d cook for him all the time. And as she watched him now, it seemed he might let her. More than that, it seemed he might enjoy it. Just the notion had her feeling more confident, and less the stammering, whey-faced ninny she\u2019d thought herself when first they\u2019d met. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She was more confident, maybe. But was she desirable?</p><p>She studied Aidan\u2019s mouth as he licked the last of the pudding from his spoon. Would he relish her kisses as much as he relished a simple spoonful of pudding? Would his lips and tongue be slow and deliberate, luxuriating in every taste? She shivered.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re cold.\u201d He shook his head, scraping the last of the bowl. \u201cAnd look at me, taking my time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not cold.\u201d She realized she\u2019d licked her bottom lip suggestively, and she bit it, wondering when she\u2019d become so wicked. \u201cNot cold at all, I assure you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s late, and you\u2019ve been too kind.\u201d He put down the bowl and stood to fetch his boots. \u201cCome, then, luvvie. I\u2019ll walk you home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Aidan,\u201d she said, her voice clear and bright. She rose, standing tall, her chin lifted. She would be resolute, acting more the heroine than ever.</p><p>Because she had questions about his kisses, and she was determined to get answers.</p><p>Chapter 14</p> <p>\u201cI still don\u2019t understand why that boy is working on our farm.\u201d Elspeth\u2019s father stoked the fire with a vengeance.</p><p>Elspeth prayed he wasn\u2019t imagining Aidan on the other end of the poker. \u201cHe\u2019s not a boy. Aidan\u2019s a man.\u201d The words sent a shiver along her skin.</p><p>Her father grunted in response. \u201cHumph. Man, boy ... whatever he is, why does he have to come here?\u201d</p><p>Refusing to face her father in anger, she squinted at her balance sheet instead. \u201cYou\u2019re blocking my light, Da,\u201d she said, shooing him aside with the sort of distracted patience born of living with someone so vociferously opinionated.</p><p>He paced to stare out the window. \u201cAnd he\u2019s still here. It\u2019s night, Elspeth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s barely evening yet. Aidan\u2019s been working hard fencing off pastureland for us, and this is the only time left available for our lessons. Unless you want that I should somehow spirit myself back and forth to Dunnottar before dawn each day?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLessons.\u201d Her father raked a hand through his wild white hair. \u201cWhy do you insist on this daft business anyway?\u201d</p><p>Her stomach growled as though it would answer the question for her. Putting a hand to her belly, she said, \u201cWe need the money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he\u2019s not paying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need the help, Da,\u201d she said in a weary voice.</p><p>\u201cYou have me.\u201d</p><p>Putting the papers down in her lap, she met his eye. \u201cAnd you\u2019re truly going to haul rock back and forth to build me a new fence? This so-called woolen business was your idea. I am merely the innocent and earnest executor of your wishes.\u201d</p><p>His fuzzy white brows twitched. \u201cWhat will folk think? I\u2019m having a hard enough time of it finding a suit-able match for you, without some knave coming about to sully your reputation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAidan is no knave.\u201d She was tired\u2014beleaguered really\u2014and turned her attention back to her papers, idly shuffling through the month\u2019s accounts. Anything was better than thinking on the third-rate widowers her father had entertained as possible spouses for her. \u201cHe\u2019s simply a good man who\u2019s had the misfortune of a lifetime of bad luck.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand why he needs to bandy his bad luck around our farm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you.\u201d She peered over the top of her papers. \u201cAidan and I are bartering my tutelage\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of man can\u2019t read?\u201d</p><p>She dropped her hands in her lap. \u201cWhat have you against him, anyway? It\u2019s not as though we\u2019re to marry.\u201d A thrill shivered through her. Did Aidan want what other men had? Would he eventually find a wife, raise a son?</p><p>\u201cAgainst him? What haven\u2019t I against him? Angus will never ask for your hand with that gudgeon lurking about.\u201d</p><p>She thought her head might explode from frustration. \u201cFather, would you please listen when I tell you there\u2019s nothing between Angus and me, nor will there ever be.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a pinched look. \u201cWell, there might be others, and I don\u2019t want them getting scared off by that pirate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that so? After all these years, we\u2019re to have an influx of bachelors in want of a bride? And their only requirement, that she\u2019s short on coin and long on books.\u201d She jabbed a triumphant finger in the air. \u201cAh! Not to mention tooth, as in long of.\u201d</p><p>Her father scowled. \u201cIt\u2019s not just finding you a husband. That boy\u2019s spent his life working among heathens, in a heathen land. Who knows what manner of woman he\u2019s bred with? What poisons mayhap course through his blood, what seeds of evil planted in his brain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeeds of evil, Father? Really. You\u2019re being an insular old cadger. Barbados is a British possession.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot till recently it weren\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it is now, and I\u2019m certain it\u2019s perfectly civilized.\u201d She loved her father dearly, but when he was in a mood, there was no talking sense. Making a conscious effort to calm her breathing, she tilted the month\u2019s tally toward the fire. A change of subject was in order. \u201cThe farm did well this month.\u201d Thanks to Aidan, she thought, with a little flush of satisfaction.</p><p>He walked back to the fire, touching a long match to the flames. \u201cIt\u2019s because I arranged to trade with Angus,\u201d he said, sucking his pipe to life.</p><p>\u201cNo, Da.\u201d She narrowed her eyes on him. \u201cIt\u2019s because Aidan arranged with Angus to trade for milled oats instead of raw.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged and spat into the fire. \u201cJust means less oats.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means we have something substantial with which to fill our bellies.\u201d Her mood snapped back to life. Rarely did she talk back to her father, and her tone elicited a sliteyed stare.</p><p>\u201cI told you, I don\u2019t want that slave boy scaring off Angus.\u201d He stormed back to the window, peering in the direction of Angus\u2019s place, even though surrounding hills obstructed the view. \u201cAngus Gunn is a good man, with a profitable farm.\u201d</p><p>She sighed, dropping her papers onto her lap. \u201cEither way, we\u2019ve turned a profit for the first time in months. And you must trust me when I tell you, Aidan has been instrumental.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere comes the devil now.\u201d Her father ducked his head back in and slammed the shutters shut.</p><p>Elspeth\u2019s pulse jumped. \u201cAidan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy does that man need to come here? Folk do call them devils, you know. Those MacAlpin children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re far from children. And they seem to have managed well enough, through the years.\u201d She smoothed her skirts, trying to still the trembling of her hands.</p><p>Her father went to the window on the other side of the door and gripped the shutter edge. He looked like he wished he could slam it right on Aidan\u2019s face. \u201cIt\u2019s not right that he comes here in the evening. It\u2019s bad enough I have to see him at daybreak, shirtless as a pirate, flaunting those shameful scars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush, Father.\u201d Her cheeks burned with rage. \u201cIt\u2019s not his fault he was kidnapped.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, tsking. \u201cMacAlpin blood is sour, girl.\u201d</p><p>She saw Aidan\u2019s silhouette, approaching their doorstep. She frantically put a finger to her lips, trying to silence him. \u201cHush! You hush now, Da.\u201d</p><p>But he only crossed his arms at his chest, no sign of stopping. \u201cThey\u2019ve always run about like a pack of demons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush,\u201d she hissed, feeling the agony of it. Why did her father persist in being so dreadfully opinionated?</p><p>\u201cIt mightn\u2019t have been his fault he was taken,\u201d he continued, \u201cbut it was his mother\u2019s fault, letting those children run about so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a horrible thing to say.\u201d She wished he\u2019d close the shutters. Aidan\u2019s shadow was at the door now. \u201cPlease, Da. He\u2019s a good man. It\u2019s a good family. You just stop now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t shush me, lass. Someone needs to spare my only daughter from blackguards like that MacAlpin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will shush you, so long as you persist with these ridiculous assertions.\u201d Her whispers had turned venomous, shocking for a girl who\u2019d always prided herself on being tractable, obedient, and respectful. \u201cYou\u2019re being prejudiced and narrow-minded.\u201d</p><p>There was a knock at the door, and she froze. Neither of them moved to answer it.</p><p>Her father scowled at her, visibly taken aback. \u201cYou can use all the fancy words in the world, lass, but mark this: if Aidan MacAlpin hadn\u2019t been as filthy and classless as an urchin, he\u2019d never have been mistaken for one.\u201d</p><p>The door opened as her father had spoken the words, revealing Aidan standing there, rigid as a statue. He glared unabashedly at her father and said, \u201cThe urchin has arrived for his lesson.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 15</p><p>Achilles ran to the door, wagging madly, and Aidan bent to give him a distracted pat on his head. Satisfied, the dog went to the fire, turned a few circles, and plopped down, dropping into a sound and instant sleep.</p><p>Aidan looked at Elspeth, his face softening. \u201cSorry to burst in, luvvie. I heard raised voices and was concerned for you.\u201d</p><p>Relief washed over her like a cool wave. He wasn\u2019t scared off by her father\u2019s words. She could handle her father\u2019s parochial ways, so long as she and Aidan were on the same side.</p><p>Her father sneered. \u201cI\u2019d never lay a hand on my daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it seems we\u2019ve something in common after all.\u201d Aidan strode nonchalantly to the fire, making as though to warm his hands, though she could see by the sweat at his neck and arms that he was already warmed through.</p><p>Her father followed, standing behind him at the hearth. \u201cYou\u2019re spending too much time \u2018helping\u2019 my daughter.\u201d</p><p>Aidan turned to face him, towering over the much older man. \u201cAnd you\u2019re not spending enough time helping her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, hush, both of you.\u201d Elspeth sprang from her chair and went to the sideboard, fetching a cup of milk. \u201cHere,\u201d she said, handing it to Aidan. \u201cI\u2019ve been cooling it in the shade.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo he drinks our milk now?\u201d her father asked. \u201cAll you do is harp about money, money, money, and you\u2019re giving him the milk for free?\u201d He glared at Aidan. \u201cThat best be the only thing she\u2019s giving away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDa!\u201d Elspeth was mortified. She knew her father was overprotective, and that he clung to set ideas and old ways, but this was too much. \u201cIt\u2019s time for our lesson. Now, if you\u2019ll please leave us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be doing no such thing.\u201d He kicked a bench against the back wall and sat down defiantly.</p> <p>She sighed. \u201cYou may stay, Da, but please be polite.\u201d</p><p>He only glared in reply, sucking thoughtfully at his pipe. The smoke drifted lazily out the open window.</p><p>She went to retrieve her small worktable from the corner, her face burning. Her father had the habit of putting the lion\u2019s share of responsibility on her shoulders, until it didn\u2019t please him, and then he\u2019d treat her like a girl who didn\u2019t know better.</p><p>Why did he insist on watching them? He was acting as though Aidan might steal something. And what had they to steal anyway? A cup of milk? Some oats?</p><p>Her virtue?</p> <p>She shivered. As if his paternal presence could curb her improper thoughts. Sinful thoughts of Aidan danced in her head every day, throughout the day, no matter the place, no matter the company.</p><p>Discomfited, she tossed out the first rational words that popped into her head. \u201cYou\u2019ll recall, Da, it was you who taught me the importance of being a gracious host.\u201d</p><p>Her father only grunted, but Aidan was at her back in an instant. He brushed a surreptitious hand at her elbow, telling her quietly, \u201cDon\u2019t worry yourself on my account. Your father is welcome to stay. It\u2019s his home after all.\u201d Though he gave her one of his jaunty smiles, it wasn\u2019t in his eyes. Reaching from behind her, he snatched the table and stool from her hands. \u201cI\u2019ll just stoke the fire before we begin. I\u2019ve noticed you see better by the firelight.\u201d</p><p>The heat of him at her back made her skin pull taut. \u201cI ... yes ... that\u2019d be lovely, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, aren\u2019t you two just a couple of maids in the henhouse?\u201d Her father tapped his pipe against the windowsill, then began to refill it from a pouch in his sporran. \u201cIs this a lesson or a tea party?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDa, I told you, you\u2019re welcome to stay, but please hold your tongue.\u201d She stole a glance at Aidan as he tended the fire. She longed to gauge his mood, but it was impossible to read him from just the set of that strong back.</p> <p>Her father was being a horrible curmudgeon, and she was terrified he might frighten Aidan off. She didn\u2019t have much in her life, and getting to spend time with her roguish hero was a precious gift\u2014one that she knew wouldn\u2019t last forever.</p><p>But then Aidan turned, and she read calm on those chiseled features. There was no cowing him, she realized. The man had faced God knew what in his life; a cold shoulder and some harsh words from a country farmer would roll off him like rain from wool.</p><p>Elspeth admired him. She knew the MacAlpins were frustrated by what they thought were his secretive ways, but she knew Aidan was simply his own man, who kept his own counsel.</p><p>He was persistent\u2014learning to read was no easy trick for a man grown\u2014and brave, too, for it was only a courageous man who admitted his weaknesses. In fact, it seemed he\u2019d returned from his last trip to Aberdeen with his passion for learning redoubled. And though it baffled</p><p>her, she didn\u2019t question it.</p><p>So long as he kept coming.</p><p>\u201cDo your worst,\u201d he said, dropping onto the stool next to hers.</p><p>His knee jostled hers as he sat, and she burned with awareness of his body, his proximity. She attempted a breezy smile, hoping to be as charmingly casual as he.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this? Miss Beth with a smile?\u201d Aidan leaned aside to let the firelight hit her full on her face. \u201cI fear I am to be the victim of your cruel intent.\u201d</p><p>The flirtatious banter brought a flush to her cheeks. She worried she might begin at any moment to grin like a baboon with her pleasure, and her lips trembled with the effort to look dignified at all costs. \u201cNot so dire as all that,\u201d she said, pulling a prized manuscript from her lap.</p><p>\u201cA fine thing.\u201d Her father\u2019s voice boomed from the corner, where he sat glowering at both of them. \u201cHaving the lass read at night. Don\u2019t you know it hurts her eyes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she protested, not lifting her eyes from the page. Cutting off the comment she knew might be coming, she quickly added, \u201cA translation of Homer\u2019s Iliad. It\u2019s a bit rough going, but I thought we could both have a try reading from it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d he said, taking it from her hands. \u201cThis is the one you told me about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, with Achilles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMary, Mother of God, preserve me,\u201d her father erupted. \u201cYou\u2019re not with that heathen nonsense again, are ye?\u201d He tapped his pipe hard on the windowsill and then glared regretfully at the empty bowl.</p><p>Elspeth bit back a smile, realizing what would liberate them from her father. \u201cAngus keeps a pipe. I imagine he can refill you.\u201d</p><p>Her father\u2019s eyes flickered bright, but then worries of propriety drooped his shoulders. He looked for all the world like he wanted to flee, his tastes running more toward tales of Cromwell and songs made for singing in the fields.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s truly fine for you to leave,\u201d she pressed. \u201cI\u2019m alone with men all the time, with Angus and with other merchants too, sorting our accounts.\u201d</p><p>He shot a measuring glare at Aidan.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve coin to spare this month.\u201d She nodded toward the door. \u201cNow go refill that wee pouch of yours.\u201d</p><p>That decided it for him. With a brusque nod and dire admonitions for his daughter\u2019s safety, Elspeth\u2019s father left.</p><p>\u201cI apologize for his rudeness,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>Aidan waved it off. \u201cTo the contrary. I\u2019m glad to see he has a care with you. I\u2019d wondered, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did?\u201d she asked, brightening. She\u2019d be sure to replay those words in her head later, mulling every possible implication.</p><p>Rather than answer, Aidan turned his attention to the book. Even though he\u2019d grown gruff, he was leafing through the pages gingerly, and she appreciated his care. \u201cWhere do you keep this one? In the sugar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour brother Declan lent it to me.\u201d When he looked up at her with raised brows, she nodded. \u201cDunnottar has a library, you know. Well, it\u2019s mostly in ruins, but a tidy collection of classics seems to have survived the devastation.\u201d</p><p>A peculiar look furrowed his brow. \u201cYou even talk like a book, you know it?\u201d</p><p>Frowning, she looked down.</p><p>With a fingertip to her chin, he tilted her face back up. \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, what of you?\u201d she asked defensively. \u201cYou speak very well yourself, despite the... for a ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor a man who\u2019s spent much time in shackles?\u201d He gave her a careless shrug, seeming to sense how she regretted her words. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, you can speak of it. It\u2019s not as though it ever slips my mind.\u201d</p><p>She tried to keep her face a blank, though she wanted to cringe. How would Aidan ever forget his past, how could he ever forget the outcast he\u2019d become, when men like her father were quick with their suspicions to remind him?</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cYou speak well, especially for one who\u2019s led a life of such privation and cruelty.\u201d</p><p>But even as she said it, she knew. She\u2019d seen for herself just how smart Aidan was. Unlike most men, who postured arrogance and pretended to know it all, he was ever ready with another question on his tongue, as if he could make up for his lost years of refinement and education in their evening lessons alone.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you where I got all my pretty turns of phrase, luvvie. Though you may not like to hear it. You see, early on, I learned the true currency of the Indies. Husbands are never about, and that leaves the wives, and they\u2019ve a taste for parlor talk around rough-looking men with gently bred voices.\u201d He sneered. \u201cI spent my mornings chesthigh in the cane, and my evenings serving rumbullion and fruit to rooms full of rich plantation women, bored of the heat and their entitlement.\u201d</p><p>Her mind spun with the hideous image. What else might bored plantation wives have wanted of their indentured servants? She opened her mouth to speak, but no words came to her.</p><p>Aidan\u2019s laugh was self-deprecating. He shoved The Iliad back in her hands. \u201cI\u2019m certain Achilles makes a better story.\u201d</p><p>He leaned forward, resting elbows on knees, watching her. He tried to look casual, but Elspeth saw his shoulders were flexed taut. \u201cSo you and Declan, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeclan?\u201d The odd question threw her, making her forget her earlier discomfort.</p><p>He nodded slowly. \u201cAye, Declan. Do you have a fancy for my brother or don\u2019t you? He\u2019d be able to talk bookish things with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeclan?\u201d she repeated. Was she misunderstanding the implication? Aidan had sounded wary\u2014was he just a little vulnerable too? \u201cNo, not Declan,\u201d she said, more slowly this time, and smiled at the relief she thought she saw along his brow. \u201cHe\u2019s merely the self-proclaimed guardian of your family library.\u201d</p><p>He barked a quick laugh. \u201cSelf-proclaimed? Uncontested, more like. Can you truly imagine someone else caring two whits about a library? Bridget? Gregor, mayhap?\u201d</p><p>She allowed herself a giggle. \u201cNo, I suppose not.\u201d</p><p>He nodded to the book forgotten in her hands. \u201cWell, shall we get on with Sir Achilles? You say he was a warrior.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d She smiled, thinking the man next to her no less heroic than any of the Greek gods. \u201cHe was away for many years. So the story went, he could have either homecoming, or glory, but not both.\u201d</p><p>Aidan curled his lip. \u201cI feel a kinship already.\u201d</p><p>She paused, realizing she needed to tread carefully. Her intent hadn\u2019t been to draw any parallels between the real man and the literary one. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But then he told her, \u201cGo on.\u201d When she raised questioning eyes to his, he added with a wink, \u201cI like when you read.\u201d</p><p>That single wink had a catastrophic effect on her composure. Deciding the best course would be simply to let Homer speak for her, Elspeth went to the first page, and tilting it toward the fire, squinted to make out the words. It was growing dark, and it was always harder to read at night. She began, \u201c \u2018Sing, Goddess, of the rage of Peleus\u2019 son Achilles, murderous, doomed\u2014\u2019 \u201d</p><p>Aidan startled her with a loud laugh. \u201cSuch drama already.\u201d</p> <p>She smiled back, and their gazes caught again, sending a ripple of pleasure across her skin. This time she let herself enjoy the connection for a breathtaking moment.</p><p>\u201cI suppose you could say the Greeks had their histrionic proclivities, yes. Our Achilles was no different.\u201d</p><p>He gave her one of those peculiar looks she was beginning to recognize, looking something between warm and baffled. \u201cRage, eh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes, he was a gloomy fellow. Consumed by anger, wanting only vengeance against those who\u2019d wronged him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you I sensed a kinship.\u201d Aidan\u2019s words were light, but his eyes were grave.</p> <p>Chagrin choked her. She\u2019d been right\u2014though they talked of Achilles, they were somehow speaking of Aidan, too. \u201cBut he was so much more than just his anger,\u201d she insisted. \u201cHe was tremendously brave too. A true hero.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed?\u201d Aidan glanced at the dog asleep by the fire. \u201cSuch a complicated name with which to saddle a poor, innocent pup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...\u201d Her mind raced, this banter more than she could handle. Night was falling, and the firelight cast one side of Aidan\u2019s face in shadow. He was so handsome, her dark rogue, and she was struggling to put two thoughts together. \u201cIt was an arrow. That killed him. Achilles, I mean. He was killed by an arrow to his heel, and that Achilles,\u201d she said, pointing to her dog, \u201chas a white heel, and so you see ...\u201d</p><p>Her voice tapered off, but Aidan was quick to pick up the thread. \u201cI do see, clearly.\u201d He pinned his gaze back on her, so intense it was as though he\u2019d touched her. \u201cYou say he was away from home for many years. What happened when he returned? Did he have his vengeance?\u201d</p><p>Were they just speaking of Achilles, or was there some deeper meaning at work again? She fluttered through the pages, as though she might be able to flip to the answer.</p><p>\u201cDid he return a hero?\u201d he pressed. \u201cDoes he die a hero?\u201d</p> <p>With a nervous laugh, she quipped, \u201cSome say he died because of his ill-advised marriage to a Trojan princess.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d hoped to change the topic to more swimmable waters, but that bit of trivia kindled something sinful to life in his gaze. \u201cAn ill-advised affair, was it? Was there nobody to counsel our hero against such an ill-fated love?\u201d He leaned closer, his voice growing huskier. \u201cOr was it simply lust that felled our great Achilles?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ... I\u2019m uncertain ...\u201d Lust. He spoke to her of lust. Liquid heat flooded her body, making her cheeks hot, her chest tight, her nothing more than a creature of acute desire. She rubbed her forehead\u2014between the evening\u2019s reading and repartee, she was becoming undone. \u201cWe\u2019ll simply have to read till the end,\u201d she finally managed, her tone overly bright.</p><p>\u201cShame on me.\u201d He leaned away, and the moment ended, leaving her wondering if there even had been a moment. \u201cI\u2019m making you read, and it clearly pains you.\u201d He reached out his hand. \u201cI daresay it\u2019s time for me to give it a go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake me.\u201d Her eyes widened, and she foisted the book at him. \u201cIt! Take it. Perhaps ... I think it\u2019s your turn. To read.\u201d</p><p>As Aidan grasped it, their fingers brushed. He stilled, and for a moment, both of their hands held the book, fingertips touching.</p><p>The door swung open, and Elspeth flinched away, mentally flaying her father with every curse she\u2019d ever read. Why did he have to choose just then to return?</p><p>The man stood in the doorway, glowering at the pair of them. Seeming to find everything to his satisfaction, he strode to the fire to stoke it. \u201cThat fool farmer\u2019s not around. And now I\u2019ve spent legs and a spent pipe.\u201d</p> <p>Elspeth glanced from her father to Aidan. Should they continue? Surely he wouldn\u2019t want to read in front of anyone else. Tentatively, she reached out her hand. \u201cShshall I?\u201d</p><p>Her father was restless, strolling about the cottage, seemingly everywhere at once, making her feel hemmed in. \u201cThe boy\u2019s not reading for himself yet?\u201d</p><p>She felt Aidan tense, and shame choked her. She knew her father didn\u2019t like Aidan, but couldn\u2019t see why he had to be so rude. \u201cHe\u2019s a man, father.\u201d</p><p>Aidan raised the book in the air. \u201cA man about to read for himself.\u201d His smile was jaunty, but his eyes were cold flint.</p><p>\u201cRemember,\u201d she told him quietly, hating that her father was watching, \u201cscan the words before you begin. I think it helps to have a picture of the page in your head before you dive in.\u201d</p><p>He did as she instructed, shaking his head. \u201c \u2018Death ... bodies ... feasts for dogs and birds ... \u2019 \u201d He glanced up, warmth in his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019ve truly read this? Seems unsuitable for a gentle lady.\u201d</p><p>Gentle lady. She swelled. Not farmer\u2019s daughter, nor rustic, nor unrefined. He\u2019d called her \u201cgentle,\u201d and a \u201clady.\u201d \u201cOh, I am. I mean, I have.\u201d She took a breath and tried again. \u201cI have read it. I adore tales of battle. Swashbuckling tales. Adventure.\u201d Would that Aidan would tell her more of his tales. Would that she were brave enough to ask.</p><p>He began to read, and though he was slow, his pace was steady. \u201cYou\u2019re a quick study,\u201d she told him between sentences. \u201cI daresay, whatever you knew as a child has mostly come back to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the quick wit of my teacher I\u2019m to thank,\u201d he said, and she gave him a blushing smile in response.</p><p>Her father\u2019s voice boomed from behind them. \u201cAre you learning or courting, lad?\u201d</p><p>She tensed, but refused to grace her father with a response. \u201cGo ahead,\u201d she told Aidan. \u201cPlease continue.\u201d</p><p>He did, until he reached a word that stumped him. \u201cAg ... Agam ... Agamem ...\u201d</p><p>Her father laughed. \u201cJust sound it out, boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just fine coming from someone who\u2019s not read a book in his life,\u201d she muttered. Then, in as quiet a voice, she whispered the correct pronunciation.</p><p>Aidan was the only one to hear, and he met Elspeth\u2019s eyes over the book. His quick nod and smile made her feel like his co-conspirator.</p><p>He read on, eventually stumbling once more. \u201c \u2018Dish ... dish\u2014\u2019 \u201d</p><p>Brows raised, he pointed out the passage, but the cottage had grown too dark. As she adjusted the page for a better look, their hands touched. Wildfire razed her senses. She thought he drew in a sharp breath, but she refused to look, fearful she\u2019d just imagined it.</p><p>She thought she saw him glance to her mouth. The most peculiar light was in his eyes, and he looked at her with purpose, as he had before, and as before, she wondered if he might kiss her someday.</p><p>What would it feel like? Would he open his mouth to nibble her like a sweet? Would she taste him on her tongue? Perhaps, someday, before he sailed away again, called by distant shores, she might ask if he would kiss her. Just one, just once.</p><p>She\u2019d ask as a favor. For surely she wasn\u2019t Aidan\u2019s type. Aidan\u2019s type of woman would be dark and voluptuous, not pale and reed thin. His type would have full, red lips. She\u2019d know when a kiss was imminent, and she\u2019d lick those lips, sending her man a telling, lingering gaze.</p><p>Something overcame Elspeth\u2014a bolt of courage, of desperation\u2014and she flicked her tongue out ever so slightly, to graze her bottom lip.</p><p>Aidan sucked in a breath, and this time she saw it to be true. This time she saw that gaze alight on her mouth. She felt suddenly too hot by the fire, too trapped by her own skin pulling taut over her breasts, at her belly.</p><p>She heard her father\u2019s footsteps shuffle across the room, and it was a splash of cold water. He was watching, and she refused to give him any more reason to mistrust. She cleared her throat. \u201cIt\u2019s dis\u2014dishonoured.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs in, what a man feels when forced to pay his debts in labor not coin,\u201d her father grumbled, oblivious to the moment occurring by the fire. He\u2019d been puttering about the cottage, in and out, fetching wood, stoking the fire, rifling through the cupboard. \u201cYou best get supper on soon, or we\u2019ll be up till midnight.\u201d</p><p>She felt Aidan tense again, and knew a surge of anger. The last thing she wanted was for him to storm off, disgruntled, or worse, discouraged. She whispered, \u201cIt\u2019s not as though he has a coin to spare.\u201d</p><p>Aidan\u2019s laugh was a low rumble in his chest. Though she was too nervous to do anything but swallow her own laugh, she hoped her smile told him how much she was on his side.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s dark, Elspeth,\u201d her father said sternly. He spoke from over their shoulders, and she startled. \u201cAnd though I don\u2019t know the man who\u2019d choose you for his seduction, it\u2019s improper. You\u2019d not be alone with the parson himself after dark.\u201d</p><p>She knew her anger could have no vent, and it tightened her lungs and set her pulse throbbing in her temples. When she answered, her voice was tight. \u201cAye, Da.\u201d</p><p>Aidan shut the book and shifted in his seat, and she wondered if she only imagined the feel of him bristling beside her. His knee touched hers for a pregnant moment. \u201cThe fence is almost done.\u201d</p><p>She felt the blood drain from her cheeks. If he was almost done with her fence, did it mean he was almost done with her too?</p><p>\u201cSo, I was thinking,\u201d he began slowly, watching her father begin his puttering again, until finally the man stormed out the door, water bucket in hand. \u201cPerhaps we should have our next meeting in daylight.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh!\u201d A little gasp escaped her lips. Aidan wasn\u2019t done with her, after all. One more meeting\u2014and perhaps she could devise a way to ensure one more after that. \u201cYes, that sounds lovely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d He mimicked her, with a rakish grin. \u201cYou see, I\u2019ve a ... document I can\u2019t quite puzzle out.\u201d</p><p>She kept a smile on her face, even as the fire in her heart dimmed just a little. He wanted to meet with her, not because he wanted to see her, but because he needed her to read something for him. She told herself it was just as well\u2014so long as it meant she\u2019d get to see him. \u201cBut of course.\u201d</p> <p>Did he mean those mysterious papers she\u2019d glimpsed once before? He\u2019d guarded them jealously.</p><p>Her mood spiked as she considered the possibilities. He was likely involved in some sort of swashbuckling pirate business\u2014a treasure hunt, perhaps. \u201cI\u2019d love to read your documents,\u201d she said with enthusiasm.</p><p>A veil dropped over his face, making him seem grim and shuttered. \u201cNo, no, luvvie. You won\u2019t be reading all of them.\u201d</p><p>Elspeth pursed her lips. He\u2019d be thinking those thoughts again\u2014that she was too weak, or too frightened. Or perhaps it was worse than that. Perhaps he simply didn\u2019t trust her.</p><p>Whatever his reasoning, whatever his business, she had to find out what he was about. \u201cWhere shall we meet, then?\u201d she asked, even as her mind raced with possible ways she could uncover his secrets, perhaps help him.</p> <p>\u201cCome see us at Dunnottar. Tomorrow.\u201d His grave expression vanished, and her handsome rogue appeared once more. He gave her a wink. \u201cYou can show me the library.\u201d</p><p>Aidan knew he should keep his distance from her. Elspeth was too smart by half, and she\u2019d figure out his business in a trice.</p><p>And he was growing impatient besides. He\u2019d taken too long with his studies, and had begun to fear the man with the pearl earring might slip through his grasp. Though he\u2019d never breathe a word of concern to Elspeth\u2014never would he want her to think herself a failure.</p><p>He knew he should stay away from her, should keep his mind on his goal, but he found he couldn\u2019t stop from visiting, couldn\u2019t help but invite her to Dunnottar. Each time he told himself would be the last time.</p><p>The thing of it was, he liked her. He liked being by her side. He found he relished an honest day\u2019s work, tied to the land, and with a woman by his side. Days when he saw Elspeth were good ones, even if they did often mean he had to endure her father in the bargain.</p><p>He liked how she carried herself\u2014she was reserved, but she stood tall. She seemed a good person, a person who knew herself, knew what she was about. He liked the little things about her too, like the way she held her books, and her look of wide-eyed appreciation as she read them, the way she bit her lower lip in concentration. She\u2019d finish and look up at him, meeting him with a face of open pleasure, lacking artifice, or judgment, or pity.</p> <p>It was as though Elspeth saw him simply as a man whose company she enjoyed. With Beth, he was neither servant nor victim. He was only Aidan. And he found he\u2019d begun to crave the feeling.</p><p>He realized with a shock that he\u2019d begun to crave her too, in ways that made him wish their collaboration lasted longer than dawn till dusk. Because Aidan had decided he might like to keep her close the whole night through.</p><p>Chapter 16</p><p>Elspeth set out that morning, using her walk as an opportunity to replay Aidan\u2019s each and every wink in her mind. She relived every brush of his hand, every twinkle in his eye, thinking if she could only but inure herself to his charms, she\u2019d be able to face him with more composure.</p><p>However, she refused to be distracted by that charm. Surely Aidan knew how much his rakish ways devastated women, and she suspected that husky voice and those sparks in his eyes had only been tools with which to dis-tract her from documents he wished to keep secret. But she wouldn\u2019t be dissuaded. She was too curious.</p><p>Not to mention too concerned for his safety.</p><p>She arrived at Dunnottar earlier than the agreed-upon time, her heart set on a little snooping. There was risk in her plan, but she was sure Aidan wasn\u2019t the sort to linger about the house. She knocked repeatedly on the tower house door, and was relieved to find nobody around. She promptly turned and strode straight for the old guardhouse that he\u2019d taken for his lodgings.</p><p>Elspeth listened at the door. Silence. Then, not allowing herself a chance to doubt, she darted inside, quickly shutting the door behind her. Bracing the door at her back, she gave her eyes a moment to adjust. Though light filtered in through a row of musket holes and the lone window, the room was dim.</p> <p>Her heart pounded from the thrill. She was sneaking around as though she were the one on a secret and dangerous mission. Like a pirate bride helping her man. Or some mysteriously seductive lady spy.</p><p>As Elspeth\u2019s sight adjusted and his few belongings came into view, she began to tremble for an entirely different reason. This was his room, and though she\u2019d been in it before, it was a different experience getting to study everything so unabashedly.</p><p>She stepped farther inside, taking in every sight, every scent. She sat on his narrow cot. It was neatly made, and the crunch of dried heather was so loud in the silence she promptly stood again, careful to smooth the wool blanket back into place.</p><p>There was a small side table, upon which stood a child\u2019s toy knight, whittled from a bit of wood. She picked it up, marveling at the detail. Marveling at the strange, unknown layers to his personality that Aidan kept hidden. Carefully, she set the knight back in its place by the washbowl, then dipped her fingers in the water and smiled\u2014he\u2019d probably used this to wash, just this morning.</p><p>\u201cFool,\u201d she whispered to herself. Smiling and shaking her head, she dried her hand on her skirts. \u201cSilly fool.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d come to find his secret papers. So where were they? She paced the tiny room, nudging the slate flooring with the toes of her boots\u2014she\u2019d read that wee cracks and chinks made excellent hiding places\u2014but no luck.</p><p>Aidan appeared to live a spartan life. No desk, no drawers, no wardrobe ... no possible hiding places. There was just an extra blanket and a few items of clothing, folded and stacked in a tidy pile under the table. She carefully sifted through all of it, but again, no luck.</p><p>She sat again on the bed, this time heedless of the groan of the frame and the crunch of the mattress. She smoothed her fingers over the blanket and, not really expecting to find anything, slid her hand under his pillow. And that\u2019s where she felt it: the crisp give of paper at her fingertips. \u201cHere you are.\u201d</p><p>She dared not risk any rumpling or ripping, and moved the pillow aside to read his papers where they lay. Riffling through, she paused at a peculiar-looking receipt of sorts. Squinting, she made sense of the words.</p><p>WARRANT OF ENTRY</p><p>BRIDGETOWN PORT, BARBADOS</p><p>CAPTAIN WM. DERBY-PHIPPS</p><p>THE ENDEAVOR (ORIG. LE\u00d3N DE ORO)</p><p>TYPE: XEBEC, 160 TONNES BURTHEN, 18 GUNS</p><p>CREW: 95</p><p>GUARANTOR: DOUGAL FRASER, KING\u2019S QUAY, ABERDEEN</p><p>It appeared to be a Barbadian port-of-entry clearance. But whose? She recognized Aidan\u2019s handwriting by now, and these elegant loops looked nothing like his cramped scrawl. Who was Captain Derby-Phipps? And why would this hold such seemingly great importance to Aidan?</p><p>She lay on her stomach, propped up on her elbows. She adored a mystery\u2014particularly a swashbuckling one\u2014 and scanned the document for clues.</p><p>She began to hum, distractedly at first, not even realizing that something had tripped a tune in the back of her mind. It was an old war song her father sang around the farm. Soon her humming became a low whisper of lyrics.</p><p>I sailed a great frigate by the name Nonesuch,</p><p>But I\u2019d turn my coat for a four-bit groat,</p><p>And so I turned against the Dutch.</p><p>Yes, I turned against the Dutch, the Dutch,</p><p>I turned against the Dutch.</p><p>And what was a xebec? The name alone sent a shiver of excitement up her spine\u2014it sounded so exotic, like something that might have a great, painted lady carved at its bow, or an army of swarthy men working its oars. It looked like the original name had been Le\u00f3n de Oro, so maybe it was a sort of Spanish galleon, so laden with chests of gold and silver bullion, it rode low in the water. Le\u00f3n de Oro, she mused with a smile, and sang another snippet.</p><p>But from Spain I stole their Lion of Gold,</p><p>And became the King\u2019s man again, again.</p><p>Became the King\u2019s man again.</p><p>William Derby-Phipps\u2014why did the name sound so familiar? Captain William Derby-Phipps. The beginning of the song popped into her head, and her excitement turned to dread.</p><p>My name is Captain Will, oh Will,</p><p>I turned pirate when I killed good men,</p><p>Their worthy blood did spill.</p><p>Their worthy blood did spill, did spill,</p><p>Their worthy blood did spill.</p><p>Could this paper have belonged to the Captain Will? She racked her memory\u2014was Derby-Phipps the name of the notorious traitor, or was her imagination running away with her yet again?</p><p>The Captain Will she knew had sailed in a small British fleet against Spain in the Thirty Years War. Facing resounding defeat, he\u2019d infamously convinced his crew to go pirate, slaughtering what British sailors wouldn\u2019t turn, and splitting from their Dutch allies.</p><p>But he\u2019d reappeared weeks later, having repossessed a ship bursting with purloined gold from the Spaniards. Captain Will comported himself quite prettily, delivering a vast bounty to the Crown\u2019s coffers. King Charles saw only a fine line between pirate and privateer\u2014particularly when the privateer in question had such a knack for acquiring riches\u2014and so with a slap for one cheek and a kiss for the other, he sent the captain off with a pardon and the gift of a strange, sleek Spanish ship.</p><p>A chill shot to her bones.</p><p>Was it possible this Captain Derby-Phipps was the pirate? Was the man even alive still? And if it was possible, and if he was indeed the pirate, what would Aidan have to do with such a man?</p><p>There was another name on the warrant, one Dougal Fraser, King\u2019s Quay, Aberdeen. Did that mean the pirate had business in Aberdeen? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Surely her imagination was running amok. But she reread it, and the evidence was there, written clearly in front of her.</p><p>What sort of dangerous business was Aidan dealing in? Was he in trouble? He didn\u2019t seem to value himself overmuch; she was frightened he might blithely place himself in harm\u2019s way.</p><p>She\u2019d read such things in stories. Men like him embraced danger, thrived on it. He was so secretive\u2014did it mean he was involved in some sort of high-risk plot?</p> <p>\u201cYou wicked chit.\u201d</p><p>Elspeth yelped in surprise and looked up.</p><p>Aidan glowered at her, his broad shoulders filling the doorway, looking like he was deciding between ravishing her or delivering a sound thrashing. He glanced at his papers, and then back to her, lying prostrate on his bed.</p><p>His gaze raked a slow path down her body, inflaming her as it dragged along her back, over her rump, down her legs, and back up again. \u201cI knew there\u2019d be perils lurking beneath still waters.\u201d</p><p>His words implied perils beyond her wildest imaginings. She fumbled to respond. \u201cI\u2014I\u2014I came early, and you weren\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThree hours early?\u201d</p><p>Painfully aware of the papers under her fingertips, she gave them a quick shuffle, but there was no hiding them completely. She could only explain them away. \u201cI wanted to help you ... you said you needed help deciphering.\u201d</p><p>He slammed the door. The room had felt small before, but now that his presence filled it, the sense of large, vibrant male closed in all around. \u201cA lesser man might think you\u2019re spying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, it\u2019s not like that.\u201d She turned to get up, but he loomed so close over the bed, and her skirts were in such a tangle, that her movements were awkward. She spotted the flicker of his eyes over the front her body, and she froze, half on her side, half on her back, the breath caught in her chest. She felt exposed, splayed in such a vulnerable position, keenly aware that she was lying on his bed.</p><p>Again, he swept his eyes over her body, and when he spoke again, his voice was a husky rasp. \u201cThen how\u2019s it like, luvvie?\u201d</p><p>Sensation flooded her. Every rumple on the bedding was an agony beneath her, her skin too hot, too tight. Her bottom, her breasts, the backs of her legs\u2014all a mass of nerves too sensitive to bear. \u201cI only want to help.\u201d</p> <p>Muttering a curse, he turned his back on her.</p><p>She smoothed the papers into a neat stack. It took every ounce of her spirit to keep her voice composed. She was determined to show Aidan how helpful she could be, how intrepid. \u201cWhere did you get these? What\u2019s the meaning of them?\u201d</p><p>He sat next to her on the bed, and his weight drew her close. \u201cI stole them.\u201d</p><p>Rather than inching away, she shamelessly let herself roll toward him. Though it was merely a fraction of an inch, it was enough for her to sense his warmth, his scent. The heat of his hip and thigh transferred directly to her, becoming an inferno in her belly. She managed to ask, \u201cFrom whom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a determined wee spy.\u201d He glared at her, and just when she thought he\u2019d ignore her question, he gave a defeated shake to his head and said, \u201cFrom a smuggler. I found a stash of papers on his ship and stole the lot of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you speaking of the smuggler you and Cormac took down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe very one.\u201d He snatched the papers from her hands. \u201cAnd though they may not be mine, they\u2019re not yours either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why take them?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m tracking a man. A man I\u2019m going to kill.\u201d</p><p>Gooseflesh crept along her skin. \u201cI can help you,\u201d she said gravely.</p><p>Aidan burst into laughter. \u201cYou\u2019ll do no such thing.\u201d</p><p>Of course she was going to help him. He was right to think she couldn\u2019t help him kill a man, but she could be valuable in other ways. \u201cI can help you decipher these. Who is it you\u2019re tracking?\u201d</p><p>He gave her a long, raw stare, and she glimpsed some bleak thing haunting his soul. \u201cA pirate with a black pearl earring. The man who kidnapped me as a child.\u201d</p><p>She shivered. She\u2019d been right all along. He was her intrepid hero, tracking down evil pirates. She riffled through his papers, so full of danger and potential adventure. \u201cPerhaps we can find a clue.\u201d</p><p>He snatched them away. \u201cPerhaps you should go home where you belong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I belong here.\u201d She reached for them again.</p><p>But he held them out of her reach, his expression shuttered once again behind his usual nonchalance. \u201cIn my bed, luvvie? How can I say no to that?\u201d</p><p>Her breath caught, and she cursed her weakness for him. He\u2019d tried to distract her with his rakish wink, and it\u2019d almost worked.</p><p>Strengthening her resolve, she came up with the one excuse she knew would keep her there. \u201cIt\u2019s our day for lessons, remember? After all, if you won\u2019t let me read the complicated bits for you, you\u2019ll need to learn to read for yourself.\u201d</p><p>That gave him pause, and he relaxed his guard for a moment.</p><p>Because she had to try again, she darted a hand out for the papers.</p><p>Startled, he laughed, and this time there was warmth in it. He put a hand at her shoulder to restrain her. \u201cYou\u2019re a wily wee fox.\u201d</p><p>She wriggled. \u201cAnd you\u2019re an exasperatingly large ... bull.\u201d</p><p>Tossing all the papers aside, he gripped her other shoulder too. \u201cA bull, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, and stubborn as one too.\u201d As she felt herself being eased back onto the bed, her mouth went dry. \u201cBut ... but ... what of our ... lessons?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll teach you a lesson.\u201d</p><p>Excitement jolted her, and it made her feel as brazen as the pluckiest of heroines. \u201cOne I\u2019ll not soon forget?\u201d</p><p>A true, hearty laugh erupted from him, and though it faded, the ghost of it lingered in his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re a strange bird, Beth. Do you know that?\u201d</p><p>Beth. That name again. She swallowed hard. \u201cSo you\u2019ve informed me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe you truly do think you\u2019re helping me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d she said earnestly. \u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing sparing a care for a man like me?\u201d She was on her back now, his hand heavy and gentle at her shoulder. He gave her a squeeze. \u201cDon\u2019t you know I\u2019m beyond help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNobody is beyond help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are. Just now, just here.\u201d He drew a tentative finger down her cheek, outlining her eyebrow, her cheekbone. \u201cLook, for example, at how vulnerable you are right now. One could easily call your predicament beyond help.\u201d</p><p>Her pulse pounded, her face burning from his touch. \u201cMine is not a predicament. That... that would imply ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cImply what? That you won\u2019t come to harm at my hand?\u201d He cupped her cheek, his movements bolder now. \u201cHow do you know that? After all, we\u2019ve really only just met. My own family barely knows me.\u201d Keeping her cradled in his hand, he leaned close to brush his cheek along the other side of her face. \u201cHow are you to know I won\u2019t ... take advantage?\u201d</p><p>The rasp of his voice, the faint graze of stubble on her skin, the pure immediacy of him sent a shock of wanting between her legs.</p><p>\u201cOr perhaps,\u201d he whispered in her ear, \u201cyou meant to imply that your current situation is a desirable one?\u201d He brushed his lips over her skin. \u201cHave I the right of it? Do you desire this situation?\u201d</p><p>He was so close, the heat of his chest imprinted itself on her breasts. His hands were strong and sure, and their touch made her feel delicate and fine.</p><p>Was this how a seduction began? Was she supposed to give him a sign? Her mind was a tumult\u2014she wanted to act, but had no idea how.</p><p>Someone shouted from far away, and Elspeth stiffened.</p><p>Aidan stilled, hovering at her cheek for what felt an eternity, his breath coming in warm, exhilarating puffs along her cheek. Dismissing the outside sounds as one of his brothers, she wondered if he\u2019d kiss her when it grew quiet again, impatient to see how he might go about it.</p><p>But when he pulled away, his eyes had gone cold. \u201cPerhaps not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait\u2014\u201d What happened? Had she done something wrong? Why had he not kissed her? I do desire it, she wanted to cry. She\u2019d thought he had too, but he\u2019d turned to stone.</p><p>Aidan bolted up from the bed, snatching his papers from where they\u2019d drifted onto the floor. \u201cI\u2019ve business to attend to.\u201d He opened the door, and standing with his back to her, added, \u201cI presume you\u2019ll see yourself out.\u201d</p><p>Chagrin, confusion, and embarrassment burned her from within. Like the greatest of heroines, she wouldn\u2019t be daunted. She would be resolved.</p><p>And then Elspeth sat up, secreting into her bodice the single, rumpled page that she\u2019d managed to steal from Aidan\u2019s pile.</p><p>Chapter 17</p><p>Aidan stormed from his room, searching for someone to throttle. Preferably the half-wits who\u2019d been making noise so near to his door. If his ears had the right of it, said half-wits had been Aidan\u2019s hired man and Gregor, who\u2019d probably detained the stranger he\u2019d found skulking about, likely with as much subtlety as a barn afire. He wanted to strangle both of them, even though their shouts had saved him from himself.</p><p>Or rather, it\u2019d been Elspeth who\u2019d been saved, from the likes of him. He\u2019d almost kissed her. He\u2019d wanted to, and badly. And if he ever kissed her, he didn\u2019t know if he\u2019d be able to stop.</p><p>Aidan stopped in his tracks, scrubbing a hand roughly over his face, willing the cold sea wind to whip the memory away. But it was no good. The picture of her lounging so carelessly on his bed was etched in his mind.</p><p>He\u2019d walked into his room, and for a joyful moment\u2014 an exquisitely painful moment\u2014he\u2019d imagined himself a man who might have a woman like her, sprawled there for him, waiting to share her smiles, just for him. To come home each night to such a sight would be heaven indeed.</p><p>But instead he\u2019d entered, and panic had jolted her, and the eyes that\u2019d greeted him were guilty, not smiling. At first he thought she\u2019d been spying on him as though he were a circus curiosity. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She was guileless, though. He always forgot just how guileless she was. He still couldn\u2019t fathom that there were people in the world decent enough to be motivated by cares for folk other than themselves. But she was such a person, and that innocence had lured him in, ever closer, until he\u2019d lain over her, wondering at the brief flickers of lightness and happiness he\u2019d begun to feel in his heart when she was near.</p><p>God save him, but she\u2019d seemed to want him. She\u2019d been a dream beneath him, responding to his every word, his every touch, as though a woman starved.</p><p>He\u2019d never met her like. He\u2019d never touched a creature so fine, so delicate, unsullied by guile, greed, or any of the cheap tools of seduction with which he was familiar. No fans, or perfumes, or coy laughter for Elspeth. She was all that was right and true and good.</p> <p>And he\u2019d wanted to ravish her.</p><p>Until they\u2019d heard a noise, and she\u2019d stiffened beneath him, and he was reminded who he was: coarse and uncivilized, a dangerous man on dangerous business, with no right to endanger an innocent like her.</p><p>He\u2019d perched near the edge of Dunnottar Rock, hundreds of feet above the roiling water. His hired man came into view, and though the man was far from the ledge, he shuffled toward Aidan, looking terrified he might somehow slip and tumble to his death.</p><p>Naturally, Gregor had to appear too, close on his heels. \u201cIs everything all right here?\u201d</p><p>Aidan knew his oldest brother couldn\u2019t resist throwing himself into the fray. The man had probably been lurking outside the guardhouse, waiting for Aidan to misstep. So much for familial trust. \u201cJust because I got kidnapped once doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t take care of myself.\u201d</p> <p>Gregor put his hands up in surrender. \u201cNo need to take umbrage. Simply trying to do the brotherly thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen go brother one of our other siblings.\u201d</p><p>Most men would bristle, but Gregor only laughed. \u201cAs you will, Aid.\u201d</p><p>He watched his brother head back the way he came, thinking it was time to remember himself. The farm he toiled on wasn\u2019t his own. The woman he toiled with not his wife. He needed to stop acting the morose and heartsick fool and get back to the business at hand. Revenge.</p><p>He turned to his hired hand. \u201cYou\u2019d best have the names.\u201d</p><p>The man held a rumpled sheet of paper, and Aidan snatched it and began to read.</p> <p>Dougal Fraser, Knitted Goodes</p><p>Aberdeen Burgess of Guild</p><p>sacke wool: 11</p><p>wool in cloth: 7</p><p>There was a signature and wax seal at the bottom of the page, with the words Weighted and Approved, Dean and Assessors of Guild.</p><p>It appeared to be a trade receipt, and though Aidan couldn\u2019t make sense of every single word, he managed most of it. He found himself once more pushing thoughts of Elspeth from his mind. That he could read anything at all was thanks to her skill and patience.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this to me?\u201d he asked, his voice gruff. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the man I asked you to find. This is some merchant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d the man replied nervously, \u201cbut a merchant, I\u2019m told, who sends his goods away on some verra peculiar ships.\u201d</p> <p>There was a rustling in the bushes behind the man. He didn\u2019t notice it, but Aidan did and sighed. If he peered hard enough, he imagined he\u2019d be able to make out a head of blond hair among the leaves. He folded the paper and shoved it into his sporran. \u201cYou can go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you says if I bring back a name ...\u201d The man looked encouragingly at the sporran.</p><p>\u201cSo I did.\u201d Aidan plucked out half a crown and tossed it to him. \u201cThe name best have some merit, or I\u2019ll find you and take my coin back with interest.\u201d</p><p>The man nodded with gusto, and with an anxious survey of the rocks around him, he began to edge away.</p><p>\u201cHo,\u201d Aidan said, stopping him. \u201cI\u2019ll throw in a tanner next time, if you can manage to get your daft head in and out of here without raising such a ruckus.\u201d</p><p>Once his hired man was out of sight, he said, \u201cYou can come out now.\u201d He waited in silence, then added, \u201cI know you\u2019re there, so don\u2019t think to hide from me.\u201d</p><p>Elspeth\u2019s head popped up over a low rise.</p><p>\u201cAnd so you should look abashed.\u201d He crossed his arms and tried to look stern, but it was difficult in the face of her endearing blush. \u201cMy business is just that, luvvie. Mine.\u201d</p><p>She clambered over the rocks she\u2019d hidden behind. \u201cWho was that man?\u201d she asked, ignoring his order.</p><p>He reached up to hand her down to his side. \u201cI hear something in that pretty voice of yours, and I don\u2019t like it. This isn\u2019t some countrified dance carouse I\u2019m planning. It\u2019s business I\u2019m about here. Business that has naught to do with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I can help.\u201d Her eyes went to his sporran. \u201cI want to help.\u201d</p><p>He knew it was just his paper she was after, but when he felt her gaze rake the area of his groin, it was hard to keep his thoughts from wandering to a decidedly baser place. He settled the sporran low on his hips. \u201cYou can help by keeping your nose safely out of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I can help you decipher it.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. The girl had more backbone than folk gave her credit for. \u201cYour job is to help me decipher books, and your wee poems, and those hero tales you\u2019ve such a fancy for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, Aidan,\u201d she begged sweetly. The wind gusted, whipping a bit of hair loose from her braid, and she tucked the fine, pale strands behind her ear. The movement pulled her bodice tight, its threadbare fabric molding to her modest curves.</p><p>She glanced again to a place between his legs. This focus of hers unsettled him. It\u2019d been months since he\u2019d had a woman. As for having a sweet innocent like Elspeth, that had happened only in his dreams. Add to that the fact that he\u2019d not fully recovered from the sight of her sprawled on his bed, or the feel of her beneath him, and the cursed sporran had begun to chafe on his hardening cock.</p><p>She pointed to his groin. \u201cJust let me relieve you of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMary and Joseph,\u201d he muttered. He loped ahead to adjust himself surreptitiously, leading them on a path away from Dunnottar. \u201cDamned fiendish woman. You have no idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could have an idea,\u201d she said, completely misunderstanding. She jogged to catch up to him, slipping along the slick terrain.</p><p>He steadied her with a hand to her elbow. \u201cMind the mud, Beth. This bloody home of ours seems rarely to dry.\u201d</p><p>Though she nodded acknowledgment, her argument didn\u2019t pause a beat. \u201cIf you\u2019d but hear me out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou spoke, I heard you, and now our wee chat is over.\u201d Aidan strode ahead once more, unsure how he\u2019d found himself in this conversation. He\u2019d never consider involving Elspeth. He was tracking the man who\u2019d kidnapped him, for God\u2019s sake. It was far too dangerous. \u201cYou\u2019ve had a peek at my papers, and it stops there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I have a canny head for business,\u201d she protested.</p><p>\u201cThere is one thing I know on this earth, Beth, and it\u2019s that I\u2019ll not allow you to entangle yourself in this particular business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I am very capable. I\u2019m very clever with numbers and tallies, and I can help\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelp?\u201d He spun to face her. She\u2019d been at his heels, and he had to grab her by the shoulders to stop her from running into him. \u201cYou can barely take care of yourself, how do you propose to help me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d The color on her cheeks was high, and her eyes were bright with defiance. \u201cCan\u2019t take care of myself? What can you possibly mean? I run the farm!\u201d</p><p>Aidan forced himself to keep his thoughts on track, but it was difficult. He\u2019d sensed Elspeth\u2019s spirit, but to see it now so unfettered, to hear her words so uninhibited, made him want to grab her, pull her close, and see what other surprises she\u2019d kept hidden.</p><p>Measuring his breath, he gathered his thoughts. \u201cYes,\u201d he said calmly, \u201cyou run the farm, but you don\u2019t have a care for yourself.\u201d</p><p>She opened her mouth to protest, but raising a hand, he cut her off. He\u2019d thought long and hard about this particular topic, and he could tick off any number of examples. \u201cSpectacles, for a start. You have trouble reading at night\u2014don\u2019t tell me you don\u2019t\u2014and you could use a pair of spectacles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I just have our priorities in order. I put my family first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFamily?\u201d The word stung. Aidan was so alienated from the other MacAlpins, barely did he feel like he had any family at all. Someday this lovely woman would pledge herself to another, become some other man\u2019s family. \u201cDon\u2019t speak to me of your family when your father ambles about as he pleases, in and out, leaving you to do work meant for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s an old man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhom you spoil as though he were a child. Do you have him hide away his pipe? No. The man can smoke all he likes. He can have all the bread he likes, and all the meat he can eat, and all the ale he can drink. But you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be such a mule, Aidan. I eat, I drink. I take care of myself.\u201d</p><p>She was riled now. Forgetting her shyness, the woman she was in her heart blazed through like a glorious beacon. And damn his soul, all he could think was that she needed a thorough ravishing.</p><p>\u201cA mule, am I?\u201d The notion brought a wide grin to his face. But it faded quickly. Never could he take her. He couldn\u2019t\u2014wouldn\u2019t\u2014sully her.</p><p>Elspeth deserved some farmer, with a safely predictable life. Not that her father would ever let her go. He doubted the man would be able\u2014or willing\u2014to fend for himself. She\u2019d spend her days caring for her father, then, upon his death, she\u2019d marry herself and her land to someone like their neighbor Angus.</p><p>A hot brew of envy, anger, and frustration coursed through his veins. He could see himself as her farmer husband. He could envision himself as the man sharing her life, protecting her, buying her wee comforts. \u201cA fine thing, this caretaking of yours. Your father has his wee luxuries, while you, Beth, you don\u2019t seem to have anything.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJust because I don\u2019t have spectacles!

When was the last time you had yourself a new dress?\u201d</p> <p>Looking suddenly forlorn, she glanced down at her muddied hem. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with my dress?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should be in finest satin, but your father has you pinching every penny.\u201d</p><p>He regretted the dismay on her face\u2014he was the last man to care about a silly frock\u2014and altered course. \u201cAll I\u2019m saying is, you seem always to put your father first. But you\u2019re not a child anymore. You\u2019re old enough to deserve the things that you want, that you need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOld enough? Are you calling me a spinster?\u201d</p><p>Spinster indeed. With the sparks in her eyes and the blood in her cheeks, Elspeth was beautiful. Like a doe who\u2019d stood frozen only to spring to glorious life. \u201cSpinster is the last word I\u2019d use to describe you, luvvie,\u201d he said with cold laughter in his voice.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare laugh.\u201d She swatted his arm, but slipped on the slick terrain. She had to grab his shirtsleeves to steady herself, looking the angrier for it. \u201cFolk have laughed, discounted, misunderstood, overlooked, and disregarded me quite enough.\u201d Clenching her fingers, she gave his arms a shove. \u201cQuite enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never discounted you, Beth.\u201d He nodded at one of her hands. \u201cYour strength, however, leaves much to be desired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou maddening, maddening ...\u201d She shoved again, and this time when she slipped, he caught her about her waist.</p><p>He cocked a brow. \u201cMule?\u201d</p><p>She held still, and when she spoke again, her voice was small. \u201cI know you\u2019re used to well-to-do women. Women who wear rich silks and feathers in their hair. I know I\u2019m not as fancy, or as well spoken\u2014\u201d</p><p>He gave her waist a squeeze. \u201cYou don\u2019t seem to be having any trouble speaking now. And trust me,\u201d he said, with an exaggerated shudder. \u201cAs for those other women, I\u2019ve little use for fancy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut I can\u2019t believe you ... you ...\u201d Her shoulders fell. \u201cAidan, you disparaged my clothing.\u201d</p><p>He laughed outright, teasing a reluctant smile from her.</p><p>She gave him one last good-natured shove. \u201cI told you not to\u2014oh!\u201d She lost her footing and tumbled into him.</p><p>Aidan caught her in an embrace, but the weight of her body propelled against him was too much. He fell backward, landing on the mucky path with a dull splat, Elspeth lying atop him belly to belly.</p><p>His laughter was unchecked now, and he wiped drops of mud from her cheek while he gathered himself. \u201cAre you happy, Beth? My clothes are now muddier than yours.\u201d</p><p>She tried to roll off. \u201cOh, good heavens. I am so sorry.\u201d</p><p>He only hugged her closer. \u201cNonsense. This serves my purposes quite nicely, because I\u2019ll not free you until I believe that you\u2019ve listened. Elspeth Farquharson, you\u2019re more well spoken, more thoughtful, gentler, and lovelier by far than any of those damned plantation women. So please tell me I\u2019ve heard the last of them from out of that mouth.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at her lips to underscore his point, but it was a mistake. Those lips were gently parted, looking long overdue for a kiss. Not to mention that the most charming mud spatter had graced her chin.</p> <p>Aidan nestled her higher along his body, and the softness of her breasts on his chest was sweet torture. It was all he could do not to roll her and take her innocence there in the mud.</p><p>Not surprisingly, Elspeth remained unaware of her predicament. \u201cI know you tire of it,\u201d she said, \u201cbut it\u2019s just ...\u201d Finally, his words seemed to register. Tilting her head, she gave Aidan a quizzical look. \u201cDid you say lovelier?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I said \u2018lovelier by far.\u2019 \u201d He could no longer fight it. The feel of her body on his held a promise too sweet to deny. Elspeth was guileless and pure, and the devil curse him, but he wanted a taste. He swept his hands down her back, resting just above the slope of her bottom. \u201cThough I can think of one way in which you\u2019re deficient.\u201d</p><p>Eyes wide, she asked, \u201cYou can?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, Beth. I daresay, you\u2019ve never been kissed.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 18</p><p>Elspeth could only stare, not trusting her ears.</p><p>Aidan shifted, his fingers splaying over the uppermost curve of her rump. She felt them through the too-thin fabric of her skirts, and then felt an answering hum between her legs.</p><p>He studied her from beneath a furrowing brow. \u201cMight I?\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t believe this was happening. She\u2019d fallen on him like a clumsy oaf, but when she\u2019d tried to get back up, he\u2019d only hugged her closer. And now her heart was pounding too loudly in her chest to make sense of it all. \u201cMight you what?\u201d</p><p>She waited for him to toss it all off with a laugh and a wink. But instead his voice became a husky whisper. \u201cKiss you, Beth.\u201d</p><p>Longing burst through her with a wild intensity. She wanted only to hear that voice in her ear, whispering dark things, his secret wishes conveyed on hot breath along her skin. \u201cYes, I wish you woul\u2014\u201d</p><p>He touched his lips to hers. They were soft, barely pressed on her closed mouth.</p><p>She breathed Aidan in and held the scent of him in her lungs, wishing he might never separate from her. But he did. Too soon he pulled away.</p><p>She opened her eyes to find him staring at her with a look so tender it filled her with a rush of feelings, all strangely new. For the first time, she felt seen, and known, and safe, and wanted.</p><p>But most of all, Elspeth felt bold.</p><p>She let go her hand from where she\u2019d gripped his shirt. He stiffened for a moment, but when she laid it back down on his face, cupping his cheek, she sensed the muscles in his neck and shoulders relax.</p><p>Did it mean he was as unsure as she? Aidan was so confident, such an exhilarating rogue of a man, she couldn\u2019t fathom that he might be as uncertain of her feelings as she was of his.</p><p>She stroked his jaw, savoring the strange, rough feel of beard stubble under her thumb, thinking of all the places she\u2019d longed to touch him. And now here she was, over him, able to touch him where she would. His jaw, his brow, down his cheek, to the corner of his mouth.</p><p>He didn\u2019t stop her. He only watched with an avid attention that deepened her pulse until it became a dull throb throughout her body.</p><p>Looking at her as he did, Aidan made her feel precious. In his arms, she was a goddess, like Aphrodite. Or Hera, the queen of them all.</p><p>\u201cMight I?\u201d she asked, in the barest whisper.</p><p>His blue eyes were intent on her. \u201cMight you what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMight I take a turn kissing you?\u201d She traced his lower lip with her finger, and his answering groan made her feel like a woman in a way she\u2019d never known before.</p><p>They came together, hard this time, each leading the kiss as much as the other. His breath changed, quickening, and it stirred her to a hunger so profound she thought she might burst from it.</p><p>They kissed, lying in the mud, with hungry mouths and questing hands, and she felt the rightness of all the books, and all the poems, that claimed that anger and passion were two sides of the same coin. For he\u2019d made her so angry, yet now she thought she might not rest until she could consume him utterly.</p><p>She\u2019d thought she wanted just one kiss\u2014had hoped that her first kiss might suffice as her last. But she knew differently now. Elspeth wanted Aidan, wanted more, wanted it all.</p><p>Eventually they separated, and cupping her face close, he stared. \u201cBeth, I ... you...\u201d A laugh escaped him. \u201cIt appears now I\u2019m the one left speechless.\u201d He traced a languorous finger down her throat to a spot just above her d\u00e9colletage. \u201cWhat other secrets do you keep tucked in that silent breast?\u201d</p><p>Knowing she\u2019d tell him everything, give him anything, she placed an earnest hand over his. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t keep a secret from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Elspeth.\u201d He gave her a quiet smile. \u201cI don\u2019t imagine you would.\u201d</p><p>After a moment, he squeezed her hand then let go. Bringing his hand to her face, he dragged his thumb along her lips, all traces of amusement gone. \u201cDefinitely beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked, not understanding.</p><p>He searched her eyes. \u201cBefore, I couldn\u2019t decide what sort of pretty you were. But you\u2019re not merely pretty, you\u2019re beautiful. I see that now. How is it everyone doesn\u2019t see?\u201d</p><p>Self-conscious, she tried to look away, but with a finger, he turned her face back to his. \u201cI think it\u2019s because you stay so quiet, hiding yourself away.\u201d He gently traced a thumb over her brow. \u201cBut these eyes, they see everything. Did you know they\u2019re flecked with gold?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, mesmerized by his words. She\u2019d never thought overmuch about her eyes.</p><p>\u201cWell, they are,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen the like. They\u2019re light but not pale, as though you\u2019ve a fairy\u2019s eyes, able to see into the hearts of men.\u201d</p><p>It was almost too much, this attention. Her deepest fantasies come true, and yet nearly unbearable, a pleasure so piquant as to demand respite. She broke the moment with a smile. \u201cNow will you let me read your papers?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled, quick with his answer. \u201cNow, especially, I won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She contemplated this man beneath her. He posed as a loner. Cold and detached, he kept himself a stranger to all, and yet she felt she knew his heart. \u201cYou don\u2019t scare me, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m afraid of.\u201d His trademark light good humor replaced the gravity in his expression. Aidan\u2019s hands roved along her back, thumbs edging recklessly inward, until his palms cradled the sides of her torso. \u201cThough hopefully there are other feelings I rouse.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her breasts pulled taut at the daring touch, until Elspeth couldn\u2019t help but lean close to take a kiss that made her forget papers and pirates.</p><p>For now.</p><p>Not even hauling water for young Bridget could wipe the smile from Aidan\u2019s face. In fact, he\u2019d volunteered for the duty, stunning his sister, but he couldn\u2019t help how expansive he\u2019d felt since seeing Elspeth the day before.</p> <p>Since kissing her.</p><p>Elspeth was sweet and untried, yet so very unabashed, with a passion that\u2019d nearly undone him. Twice in the night he\u2019d been forced to seek his own release, so vivid was the memory of her, lovely and pure.</p><p>Lovely, with fey, yellow-flecked eyes, and a mouth shaped like a delicate bud, equal parts tender and hungry. And yet it was Elspeth\u2019s spirit that\u2019d redoubled his desire. She saw him for who he was, for who he wanted to be. Saw straight through his facade to his very heart, and rather than turn away, she\u2019d embraced him, had made him feel all the more complete.</p><p>With Elspeth he felt like a man\u2014his own man\u2014more than any fight or fisticuffs or hard labor had ever made him feel. She was a gift, this strange tutor of his, and the bachelors of Aberdeenshire were fools not to have noticed before he.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d the girl threaten you with?\u201d a voice asked from behind him.</p> <p>Aidan\u2019s smile flickered, but he\u2019d not let his twin put a damper on his mood. He finished drawing the bucket from the massive well before he looked over his shoulder to face him. \u201cGirl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBridge.\u201d Cormac nodded at the bucket. \u201cWhat\u2019d she say to get you on water duty?\u201d</p><p>Bridget\u2014not Elspeth. Aidan breathed a sigh he didn\u2019t realize he was holding. \u201cOh, her. The chit has enough on her plate, and this is easy enough for me.\u201d He stood, lifting the bucket from the ground as though it weighed nothing, proving his point.</p><p>Though his little sister\u2019s brash ways still irritated, watching Elspeth\u2019s struggles had made Aidan more sympathetic to the vast amounts of work required to run a home.</p><p>Cormac lifted a questioning brow. \u201cHelping her like you\u2019re helping that Elspeth?\u201d</p><p>Aidan bristled, wondering if that was a smirk he read on his brother\u2019s face. Choosing to ignore it, he walked past him, headed across the courtyard and back toward the kitchens. He was a proud man, particularly in front of his twin, and so had underplayed how much Elspeth was tutoring him. No surprise, then, that Cormac might misunderstand Aidan\u2019s work on the Farquharson farm.</p> <p>He felt Cormac walk up behind him to ask, \u201cWhat are your motives with that girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you think I have motives?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen you on the road to her farm. A lot.\u201d Cormac reached out, stopping him with a hand on his arm. \u201cShe\u2019s no doxy to be toyed with.\u201d</p><p>Aidan shook off his brother\u2019s grip. \u201cI\u2019d never think to toy with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why?\u201d Cormac asked, but Aidan just stared blankly in reply, and so he repeated, \u201cWhy go to her so much?\u201d</p><p>Aidan sensed his brother wasn\u2019t going to let it go, and so he put the bucket down. \u201cWhy not go to her? She\u2019s a good woman in need of help.\u201d When Cormac had something to say, he was as tenacious as a dog with a bone\u2014 best to give him the chance to say his piece and be done with it.</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s been years since you\u2019ve been around Scottish women,\u201d his brother said in an aggravatingly deliberate tone. \u201cBut Elspeth Farquharson is a homely sort of girl. A spinster who probably\u2014\u201d</p><p>Resentment, frustration, and envy drove his fist, and his right hook connected with his brother\u2019s face before he knew what he was about. It was something he\u2019d wanted to do for some time.</p> <p>Cormac reeled backward, and caught off guard, he tripped on the uneven turf, falling to the ground. He sat up at once, rubbing his jaw, the look in his eyes more disbelief than pain. \u201cWhat the devil was that for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t speak so of her,\u201d Aidan said, his voice flat and hard as steel.</p><p>Cormac studied him for a time, until finally he said, \u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>Aidan watched his brother\u2019s brow soften in understanding, and it made his own furrow all the more. \u201cYou see nothing.\u201d</p><p>Cormac only rolled his shoulders, proffering his hand for a boost up, but Aidan didn\u2019t reach out to grab it.</p><p>\u201cGive it a rest, Aid,\u201d Cormac said, his voice tired. \u201cWe may not know you, but we certainly remember how much we loved you. You\u2019ve got to meet us in the middle sometime.\u201d</p><p>Aidan glared at Cormac. The brother whom he\u2019d once loved more than anyone. More than anything. He tried to recall the boy who\u2019d insisted on climbing the chimney. The boy who\u2019d vexed him beyond measure. Who\u2019d squabbled with him, and bugged him.</p><p>And who\u2019d always stood by his side when nobody else did.</p><p>He\u2019d seen the joy in Cormac\u2019s eyes when they\u2019d met again, for the first time in more than a decade, on that grim Aberdeen dock. He\u2019d pushed his brother away, and had been pushing them all away ever since.</p><p>Except for Elspeth. She\u2019d penetrated his defenses, and he\u2019d let her, and it\u2019d felt so good. Like a breath of sea air after weeks in the ship\u2019s hold.</p><p>It would take all his pride, all his courage, to do the same with his family. Though he didn\u2019t know why it should. They\u2019d grieved him, but Highland life was hard, and thirteen years were long, and life went on.</p><p>He\u2019d take a chance. It was what Elspeth would advise him to do.</p><p>He reached down, clasping Cormac\u2019s hand, and pulled him to standing. Aidan stepped back quickly, though, putting space between them. He needed this reunion to happen one step at a time. And the next step was making sure Cormac understood one thing. \u201cI have your word you\u2019ll not disparage Elspeth again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t think of it,\u201d he replied quickly. Cormac bent to pick up the bucket, adding, \u201cTruly, I wasn\u2019t dis</p><p>paraging Elspeth. I like the girl.\u201d</p><p>Aidan glowered daggers at him.</p><p>\u201cNot like that, you half-wit.\u201d Cormac rolled his eyes.</p><p>As they set off for the kitchen, Aidan knocked his shoulder hard into his twin. \u201cWho\u2019s the half-wit?\u201d</p><p>They walked on, their pace slow, unanimously agreeing to prolong the moment, though neither would ever confess to it.</p><p>When Cormac spoke again, his tone was grave. \u201cI knew, Aidan. I felt that you were out there. Alive, somewhere. We\u2019d been inseparable for years. We bickered, yes, but always we were together. Always we were one. We were even born at the same time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I was first, you\u2019ll recall.\u201d Aidan tossed off the jest, needing to break the intensity of his brother\u2019s words.</p><p>Cormac gave him a playful slug on the arm. \u201cThen act it.\u201d</p><p>Aidan relented, saying in a low voice, \u201cI knew too. I knew you lived.\u201d He smirked. \u201cJust as I knew I\u2019d someday come back to find you and Marj married.\u201d</p><p>Their laughter broke out at once. \u201cMar-jorie,\u201d they said in unison.</p><p>\u201cCrivvens, man.\u201d Aidan shook his head, pretending exasperation. \u201cYou and that girl. From the start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy wife, you mean,\u201d Cormac said with mock severity.</p><p>\u201cYour wife,\u201d he said drily. \u201cBetter you than me.\u201d He had to sidestep to avoid Cormac\u2019s thrown elbow. With a laugh, Aidan added, \u201cSo, what do you get from her anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell that\u2019s an easy one to answer,\u201d Cormac said with a wink and a nudge.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious,\u201d he said, realizing it was true. The feelings growing in his heart for Elspeth were overpowering\u2014 sharp, and hot, and terrifying too. It was hard to imagine they weren\u2019t the rarest of all emotions. But perhaps the sensation was normal, perhaps it was what men felt for their wives. Perhaps his wife was precisely what Aidan wanted Elspeth to be.</p><p>They\u2019d reached the castle, their sisters\u2019 voices echoing off the stone corridor. Cormac handed the bucket back to Aidan, nodding toward the sound. \u201cBridge\u2019ll be wanting her water. Five minutes ago, if I know our sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d Aidan replied with a knowing smile. It seemed he wasn\u2019t the only MacAlpin of the opinion that the girl could stand to be taken down a peg.</p><p>Cormac\u2019s expression grew serious. \u201cHave a care, Aid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d The words came quickly, dismissively.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Cormac put a hand on his shoulder. \u201cTruly, Aidan. Have a care. It was my fault we lost you once, and I\u2019ll not see it happen again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t your\u2014\u201d</p><p>Cormac punched his shoulder. \u201cJust shut up and promise if you need help you\u2019ll tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d Aidan said. He met his twin\u2019s eyes with a smile. \u201cI will. I promise.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 19</p><p>Elspeth lay in bed. The sun had yet to rise, but she couldn\u2019t sleep for thoughts of Aidan. And his kiss.</p><p>Restless, she rolled onto her side, thinking of his mouth. It had been gentle at first, and then harder, and hungrier. Blood thrummed through her body at the memory.</p><p>Nestling deep under her covers, she grazed a slow hand along her torso and cupped her breast. Her skin tingled at the memory of his hands on her sides, of his thumbs roving that perilous line where rib meets bosom. She thumbed her nipple, and it stiffened, she imagining what he might do with his fingers.</p><p>She played the scene over in her mind, and this time Aidan didn\u2019t end the kiss. He didn\u2019t insist on propriety, didn\u2019t act like the most seemly of gentlemen and lift her to her feet.</p><p>Instead, in her fantasy, he rolled her onto her back. The mud would\u2019ve been warm, still holding the heat of his body. But the air on her legs would be cool, her skirts rucked high on her hips ...</p><p>\u201cYou, in there!\u201d Her father\u2019s voice shattered her reverie, calling to her from the other room.</p><p>Her eyes shot open, her heart leaped to her throat, and her hand flew from her breast. Even though her father was in the other room, even though he never entered hers, Elspeth\u2019s heart pounded. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cComing,\u201d she said, even as she nestled deeper in the sheets. Dawn had finally come, sliding gray fingers through the shutters. Rolling onto her back, she came to terms with the reality of her day.</p><p>Though it was set in a corner in the main room, she heard the creak of her father\u2019s cot. Heard him shuffling along the stone floor, followed by the pop and crackle of a nascent fire. \u201cFool girl,\u201d he was grumbling to himself, \u201clays abed, and there\u2019s work to be done.\u201d</p><p>Elspeth sighed, baring linen-clad shoulders and then arms to the chill air. Like every other morning, she swung her legs out of bed, bracing for the shock of cold stone underneath sleep-warmed feet.</p> <p>\u201cTime to wake up and feed the sheep,\u201d he called.</p><p>\u201cAye, I\u2019m coming, I\u2019m coming,\u201d she called back. But, unlike every other morning, this time she\u2019d awakened with a smile on her face. Because she\u2019d finally realized how she could help Aidan. And today was the day she\u2019d take action.</p><p>They\u2019d kissed, which meant the responsibility she\u2019d felt for his well-being was justified. He was a roguish sort, and danger followed such men. She sensed trouble, and knew she needed to see just what sort of people he was involved with. She\u2019d stolen just a single sheet from his papers, but it bore the name of a man in Aberdeen, and a name was a start.</p><p>Dougal Fraser.</p><p>She had to do all she could to ensure Aidan\u2019s safety, because she was fairly certain she loved him. Unfortunately, she was also fairly certain he\u2019d likely never love her back the same way. But he was her romantic hero, and she\u2019d give anything to be his heroine, even if it was just this once.</p> <p>And what did the heroines do in all the great stories?</p><p>They intervened in the affairs of their men.</p><p>Dougal Fraser was nervous, but not such a fool as to show it. Few men clawed their way free of the Aberdeen gutters, but Dougal had, and he knew that more than hard work, he owed his success to a talent for bluffing. His hair had gone gray, and his knees had begun to ache, but still it was upon this skill alone that he most relied.</p><p>He leaned back in his chair, affecting calm confidence. \u201cTell me ... Francis ... your captain guarantees I\u2019ll receive my payment in raw cotton?\u201d</p><p>The beefy man who sat across from him flinched. Urchins on the street knew the fellow only as \u201cthe yeoman,\u201d and use of his Christian name had the unsettling effect Dougal sought. \u201cAye,\u201d he said, shifting uncomfortably, \u201cthem\u2019s the terms of our agreement, like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, let\u2019s talk of our terms. I\u2019ve staked the ship, I\u2019ve filled your bellies.\u201d Dougal pointed with distaste at the man\u2019s overlarge girth. \u201cBut now I want guarantees.\u201d</p> <p>The yeoman bristled. \u201cEvery docksman in Aberdeen kens Captain Will is as good as his word. If the man says a thing, it\u2019s because he means it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCaptain this, Captain that.\u201d Something about this infamous captain rankled him. The man\u2019s past was shrouded in mystery, and Dougal wondered what he might be hiding. \u201cIt\u2019s not what your captain says or does in Aberdeen that concerns me. It\u2019s what happens once he sets sail, with my goods.\u201d Referring to their cargo as \u201cgoods\u201d felt so much more civilized than calling them bodies, or slaves, or servants, or hides, or whatever distasteful nomenclature people bandied about.</p><p>The yeoman worried the cap in his hands, thinking hard, looking as though steam might come out his ears from the effort. \u201cIf you\u2019ll be begging my pardon, it takes a lot to keep \u2019em souls alive. I don\u2019t ken why you just don\u2019t trade with money like other folk do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese far-flung plantations need labor, which sur-rounds me in abundance.\u201d Dougal\u2019s lingering glare said he included the yeoman in the distasteful category. \u201cAnd here I am, in need of cotton. Which\u2014in addition to savages and the putrid fever\u2014it appears these godforsaken tropical locales are choking upon. Meanwhile, the Crown wants taxes, taxes, taxes when goods are bought and sold, yet you might imagine I am loath to pay a farthing of my hard-earned income.\u201d Resting his elbows on his desk, Dougal steepled his fingers, smiling triumphantly. He was as impressed with his scheme as he\u2019d been on the day he hatched it.</p><p>But the man only stared dumbly, not getting the connection.</p><p>Dougal spelled it out in an insultingly slow pace. \u201cI fund and fill a ship with able-bodied men. Your captain sails it away. But then he sails it back. Filled with cotton. Voil\u00e0! I\u2019ve made a trade, but the Crown is none the wiser.\u201d</p><p>The man continued to gape, and Dougal was forced to ask after a moment, \u201cDo you see what I\u2019m about here?\u201d He gestured impatiently behind him. \u201cKnit goods. Cotton from the tropics expands my offerings. Cotton I get by trading for men, not money. No money means no taxes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems a terrible lot of confusion to my mind.\u201d</p> <p>Not confusing, brilliant. And he was convinced the scheme was only slightly illegal. The slave trade was loosely sanctioned by Parliament, after all. And with this elusive captain as his go-between, Dougal remained unexposed, and his reputation unsullied.</p><p>\u201cThen it\u2019s a good thing it\u2019s not up to you to wrap your mind around it.\u201d Dougal sat upright and began to shuffle papers on his desk. He had no patience for dimwits and was eager for this particular interview to reach an end. \u201cNow stop flapping your jaw and tell me what you\u2019ve come to tell me. Have you finished gathering our cargo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, the ship\u2019s full, but captain\u2019s coffers isn\u2019t. He wants that\u2014\u201d</p><p>They were interrupted by a faint knocking on his door.</p><p>The yeoman stiffened, instantly on alert, vicious intent lighting his face.</p><p>Dougal rolled his eyes. \u201cCalm yourself. This is my place of business, not a Cornish wrestling hall.\u201d</p><p>He stood and went to the door, meaning to crack it open himself. It\u2019d be well if whoever had come calling didn\u2019t see him with one such as \u201cFrancis the yeoman.\u201d</p><p>But instead the door opened on Dougal, nearly striking him in the face. He rubbed his nose at the near miss, but his outrage faded when he laid eyes on his visitor.</p><p>It was a girl. Though she wasn\u2019t precisely pretty, neither was she rough on the eyes. She was a pale creature, with a delicate nose, lips that were curved but not full, and a chest that was sadly meager.</p><p>\u201cDougal Fraser?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Her voice was meek, and it made her seem all the more fragile. All in all, he doubted she\u2019d be able to stand up in a strong gust of wind, for all that she\u2019d nearly swung the door in his face.</p><p>But who in holy hell was she?</p><p>\u201cAt your service,\u201d he said, knowing the charming words didn\u2019t match the tightness of his tone.</p><p>He stepped in front of the doorway to block her view, but it was too late. She\u2019d seen the yeoman and her eyes widened. Though she recovered quickly, he spied the mental machinations that\u2019d begun in that eerily pale gaze.</p><p>Whoever the chit was, she was canny.</p><p>His only choice was to control the damage. Dougal gave the man a pointed look. \u201cTake your leave now.\u201d</p><p>The yeoman\u2019s ruddy cheek twitched. Looking illpleased, he rose and sidled past them out the door. \u201cVerra well then.\u201d</p><p>The dock riffraff momentarily dispensed with, Dougal took the girl\u2019s elbow and, feigning graciousness, led her to a seat. \u201cWhom do I have the pleasure of entertaining here in my humble office?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWoolen goods ...\u201d she mused, craning her head to read the sign on his door. \u201cWoolen goods. Woolen goods!\u201d</p><p>Those strange eyes met his. They\u2019d gone bright, and he saw up close the unusual yellow flecks that streaked from her pupils like sunbursts.</p><p>Daft or deft, that was the question. The girl was a conundrum, and conundrums put Dougal on his guard. Her quavering voice bespoke a ninny-headed lass. But she\u2019d clearly been braw enough to venture into the heart of Aberdeen alone. Was hers the trembling confusion of an innocent, or an act?</p><p>\u201cYes, my business is woolen goods.\u201d He sat at his desk, across from her. \u201cBut what is your business, Miss ... ?\u201d</p><p>Something in her eyes snapped to attention. \u201cFarquharson. Elspeth Farquharson.\u201d</p><p>Her name nagged him. \u201cFarquharson ... Ah,\u201d he said, recognition dawning. \u201cJust so. A Farquharson contacted me not too long ago. Said he was in the sheep business. A bit old, but ... your father perhaps?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s so.\u201d She sat tall, looking guarded.</p><p>He remembered all of it now. The man had been a bit doddering, striking Dougal as an addle-brained but unthreatening sort of fellow. Feeling the daughter\u2019s unsettling gaze on him now, he wondered if he hadn\u2019t underestimated the situation. If the man\u2019s purpose was to do business, why had he sent this girl in his stead? \u201cI recall, he said he\u2019d just one child. A daughter. So you\u2019re she.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Elspeth replied, looking distinctly uncomfortable. \u201cI am she.\u201d</p><p>Was she surprised she\u2019d been recognized? Had her father sent her to spy?</p><p>Dougal\u2019s mind raced. \u201cYour father is new to the sheep business, as I recall. He brought some papers here, outlining his vast enterprise.\u201d</p><p>The lass looked shocked to hear it. He smirked, thinking he\u2019d been right\u2014the man Farquharson was simply a doddering old grump.</p><p>But his smile faded when another detail popped into memory. \u201cI recall seeing the initials EF on those papers. Yet your father\u2019s name is Albert.\u201d</p><p>Perhaps he was being overly suspicious, but his new slaves-for-cotton venture was just taking off. He was on the brink of making a great fortune, and it was not the time for young misses to be nosing around.</p><p>She lifted her chin. \u201cYou read correctly.\u201d</p><p>Dougal registered her every movement, realizing he\u2019d misjudged. A shy and plain-faced creature she may be, but the chit wasn\u2019t meek. \u201cI suppose EF stands for \u2018Elspeth Farquharson\u2019?\u201d</p><p>She gave a tight nod.</p><p>So she was in charge of the accounts, not the father. \u201cGood on you, girl. You\u2019re brighter than I took you for. I\u2019ll wager many folk underestimate your like.\u201d He narrowed his eyes. The only thing worse than a scheming woman was a scheming, impoverished woman. \u201cWhy are you here? And don\u2019t insist you were in the neighborhood.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The girl was silent, measuring. Was she at a loss, or was this part of her ruse?</p><p>\u201cYour father has a peculiar way of broaching a potential business relationship,\u201d he said, filling the silence.</p><p>\u201cMy father doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIndeed?\u201d He was genuinely taken aback at this latest wrinkle. He suspected she played a deep game, but he\u2019d been swimming in deep waters long before she was born.</p><p>He found himself smiling. To his surprise, he was not unamused. It\u2019d been years since he\u2019d been in the company of a young female. Moreover, he loved a lively discussion, and intelligent debate was something sorely lacking in his dockside venture. He suspected if he plumbed deeper, this Elspeth would hold up admirably in a mental crossing of swords.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to hear what I think?\u201d he asked. \u201cYour father told me about his business. I worry how profitable such a harebrained venture might be. I think you worry too.\u201d</p><p>He could see in her pursed lips just how on the mark he\u2019d been.</p><p>But then she shocked him by snapping, \u201cYou should worry more about your own presumptions.\u201d</p> <p>Dougal laughed outright. \u201cWhat a singularly puzzling thing you are.\u201d</p><p>The lass might look green enough to be his granddaughter, but she was a clever one. And, he realized, not unpretty at all. Quite fair, in fact.</p><p>He wondered if the girl could be brought to heel. He\u2019d never married\u2014business had always taken precedence\u2014 but he saw now that a man might go far with a partner of pleasant countenance and bright mind by his side. Even better that her family was in the woolen business.</p><p>A sheep farm could be just the thing to explain away his new profits. Elspeth\u2019s father was in desperate financial straits. Time for Dougal to see just how desperate.</p><p>He reached across the table and patted her pretty little hand. \u201cPerhaps we should settle on an alliance, you and I?\u201d</p><p>Chapter 20</p> <p>Elspeth studied Aidan\u2019s profile and felt a pang. She\u2019d been working distractedly on her tallies when he arrived, and when he\u2019d asked to see them, she\u2019d been happy to oblige. But now he was poring over the account book in such earnest, doing his level best to help her.</p><p>As she was doing her best to help him.</p><p>\u201cTwenty head isn\u2019t many of the cursed beasts,\u201d he was saying, pointing to a figure. He tilted the book toward the window to aid her, even though the day wasn\u2019t dark enough yet to hamper her vision. \u201cBut they\u2019ll account for more wool than this at shearing time.\u201d</p><p>She stared blindly at the number, wondering who Dougal Fraser really was. The strongman he\u2019d been entertaining when she arrived had done nothing to put her mind at ease. He\u2019d seemed a shadowy, criminal sort.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not just shearing it into sacks. If you grade it\u201d\u2014he met her eyes, mistaking her silence for confusion\u2014\u201cgrade it ... meaning ... to open up the fleece, aye? Tear out the hard bits, clean it up. It increases its worth in a higher proportion to the labor it requires.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, not caring. Why would Dougal Fraser\u2019s name appear on one of Aidan\u2019s papers? What would an aging wool merchant have to do with the pirate who\u2019d kidnapped him?</p><p>And what was her father doing meeting with the likes of Fraser, anyway? Surely it just had something to do with wool, but Da was pitifully lacking in good sense, and she hoped he wouldn\u2019t get both of them in trouble.</p><p>\u201cThis word, though ... this is shoulder?\u201d</p> <p>She glanced to where Aidan pointed. \u201cYes. Very good. Shoulder.\u201d</p><p>How on earth might a knit export business be connected to the man who\u2019d kidnapped Aidan? Had it something to do with ships? She thought of the paper she\u2019d stolen. Was it a dead end? Or did it hold a pertinent clue? She wondered if she shouldn\u2019t just sneak it back among Aidan\u2019s papers.</p><p>\u201cSo then, regarding this figure here,\u201d he said, pointing to a number. \u201cYou should account for it differently. Shoulder wool is finer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She glanced at the tally. \u201cFiner.\u201d</p><p>When she went to Fraser\u2019s office, she didn\u2019t know who he was or what she\u2019d find. And she certainly hadn\u2019t wanted to betray her identity. Her plan had been simply to feign innocence, get a sense of what he was about, and scuttle home again.</p><p>But he\u2019d recognized her name, and now she seemed to find herself in a fix she didn\u2019t quite understand. At the end of their interview, he\u2019d patted her hand, and his touch had made her flesh creep. Its implication had made her deeply uneasy. Not to mention, she hadn\u2019t uncovered any clues as to Aidan\u2019s predicament, leaving her more confused than ever.</p><p>She realized Aidan hadn\u2019t spoken for a time, and she looked at him.</p><p>He raised a brow. \u201cAre you paying attention?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeg pardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re distracted, Beth. I\u2019ve just pointed out a way you can double your profits, yet you seem to be off gathering wool of a different sort.\u201d</p><p>She stared back at him, utterly baffled.</p><p>\u201cWoolgathering. As in daydreaming.\u201d He put her account book down. He\u2019d been so excited to see her, wondering how he might steal another kiss. Yet she seemed to be a thousand leagues away.</p><p>Had he frightened her with his kiss? Put her off? But he knew those fears were unfounded. She\u2019d kissed him back with the enthusiasm of a wanton\u2014just the memory of it drove him wild.</p><p>She was likely preoccupied with troubles of her own. He knew she had them in droves, and he was trying hard to help her. His reading had improved enough to double-check her tallies, but not so much that he could be the man he wanted to be. A learned man, who could handle all the accounting, all of the bills and correspondence required of a responsible gentleman.</p><p>He stole a look at her. She was deep in concentration, her lips pursed into the most unintentionally sexy little pout. It was all he could do not to toss her papers to the ground and simply claim that mouth with his.</p><p>No, he decided, feeling more determined than ever, he needed to be a learned man, an erudite man. A man able to read her sonnets as they lay beneath a tangle of sheets, their bodies entwined.</p><p>She looked to him, catching his stare. He gave her a smile, and for once it didn\u2019t smooth the furrow from her brow.</p><p>\u201cNever you mind it,\u201d he said, shutting the book. He\u2019d just have to work harder so he could shoulder more of her burdens. She thought the work was tedious, but he found himself dreaming of such duties. He\u2019d enjoy things like minding the monthly accounts, would enjoy a farm to call his own, and a wife like her to share it with.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I suppose I am woolgathering.\u201d She gave an absentminded half smile. \u201cIt\u2019s just ... do you think your pirate is in Aberdeen? If you\u2019d let me read your papers, I could help you search for clues.\u201d</p><p>He stiffened. He\u2019d known when he found her that day in his room that trouble lay on the horizon. \u201cI\u2019ve told you. My papers are private.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you trust me?\u201d</p><p>Her delicate brow was furrowed, and he was sorry to have been the one to put the worry there. \u201cOn the contrary, I trust you more than I trust any other soul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what is this business you\u2019re about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy business is to keep you safe,\u201d he answered without thinking.</p><p>\u201cTruly, Aidan?\u201d Light snapped to life in her eyes, dancing clear and bright. She smiled at him\u2014for him\u2014 and he felt his heart swell. \u201cTruly you want to keep me safe?\u201d</p><p>He stared at her a moment, taking in those all-seeing eyes, her gentle countenance, and her face, fine as porcelain. She was kind and good, sweet thoughtfulness and artless honesty. She was all that had been taken from him so long ago\u2014and all that he desired now. He realized how true his words had been. He did want to care for her.</p><p>And it unsettled him.</p><p>More than any revenge or intrigue, it was this genteel, bookish woman who\u2019d managed to unnerve him. A mere few moments of her uncharacteristic lack of attention, and he\u2019d fretted and frowned like a schoolboy. But then, when he\u2019d shown the simplest consideration, she\u2019d come to life, looking at him with such warmth, and not an ounce of artifice. He fantasized what it would be to let her in. To tell her his secrets, feeling that gaze focused only on him, her responses ever transparent and true. Truly to keep her safe.</p><p>To keep her.</p><p>\u201cWant to? Aye, Beth. I find I do.\u201d</p><p>But even as he said it, he knew he couldn\u2019t share a bed with a treasure like her while his nights were spent dreaming of revenge. In a distant future, when he was a respectable man, a man of books and accomplished in a trade, he would court her in earnest. But first, he needed to exorcise his past.</p><p>He\u2019d spent most of his life wanting one thing: to find and kill the man who\u2019d kidnapped him so long ago. But now Aidan found he had a second dream, a fragile one, only now blooming to life in his chest.</p><p>To be worthy of Elspeth Farquharson.</p><p>But first, he\u2019d need to settle his business. He\u2019d track down and kill the man with the black pearl. He\u2019d put his past forever behind him. Because, for the first time, he could envision a future.</p><p>\u201cSomeday,\u201d he said quietly, \u201csomeday I\u2019ll be worthy of it.\u201d</p><p>She bolted straight in her chair and grabbed his hands in hers, sending papers fluttering to the floor. \u201cYou\u2019re worthy now.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d been bought and sold. He knew his worth. It was six pounds two shillings sterling.</p><p>\u201cNo, not of you, of this.\u201d He turned her hand over in his. It was so small, the fingers delicately tapering to clean, finely rounded nails. He traced her palm and then ran a thumb along a thin line of callus. She worked hard on the farm\u2014harder than she ought.</p><p>She snatched her hand back with a rueful frown that cracked his heart. \u201cMy hands aren\u2019t fine like a lady\u2019s hands should be.\u201d</p><p>Grabbing it back, he kissed her palm. \u201cYou\u2019re wrong.\u201d</p><p>Tenderly, he turned it over, kissing her knuckles like the most dashing of courtiers. \u201cYours are the finest of all. You, everything a lady aspires to be.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Not letting go, he met her eyes. Her look of dumbfounded wonderment was so endearing, a little laugh escaped him. \u201cSweet Beth. I would like to care for you someday. If you wished it.\u201d</p><p>The door swung open, and they sprang apart.</p><p>Her father scowled at him. \u201cTime for you to leave.\u201d</p> <p>Aidan gritted his teeth. One day he\u2019d have his own cottage, and he\u2019d sit with Elspeth by the fire for as long as he cared to.</p><p>\u201cBut he just got here,\u201d Elspeth said, and the plea in her voice firmed Aidan\u2019s resolve. \u201cHe\u2019s helping me with my accounts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re off to see a businessman who knows accounts better even than you, girl.\u201d Farquharson grabbed her shawl from a peg and strode to her, gesturing impatiently. \u201cUp, up you go. I\u2019ve a message from the greatest knit merchant in all Aberdeen.\u201d</p><p>Aidan curled his fingers into his knees, determined not to leap from his seat to coerce a more respectful tone from the old man\u2019s mouth.</p><p>She stood warily. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m talking about none other than Dougal Fraser, and he\u2019s a fancy to meet you.\u201d</p><p>Aidan\u2019s feet shuffled abruptly beneath him, his body very nearly springing to throttle the man\u2019s throat before he could think better of it. He\u2019d seen the name Dougal Fraser before, on a slip of paper given to him by an Aberdeen hired man.</p><p>The movement had drawn her father\u2019s eyes, and while he spoke to his daughter, he continued to glare at Aidan. \u201cFraser asked if you were promised to anyone. I\u2019m happy to tell him you\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>She flinched back. \u201cBut he\u2019s an old man.\u201d</p><p>Aidan shot her a look. What did Elspeth know of Fraser?</p><p>Her father stepped close, tossing the shawl haphazardly around her shoulders. \u201cWhat do you know of Lord Fraser?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI ... I\u2019ve heard of him,\u201d she said, adjusting herself. \u201cI simply assumed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he said some things, put me in mind of an alliance of sorts. Our brains run along the same track. Both business-minded men, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat sort of alliance?\u201d Aidan demanded in a hard voice. But he didn\u2019t need to hear her father spell it out to know: the man wanted to marry Elspeth. The need to protect her, to possess her, seethed in his belly.</p><p>Farquharson ignored him, his face splitting into a grin that mocked Aidan. \u201cI\u2019m assuming he wants to see you to ask for your hand, fool girl. He spoke of the potential of this very farm.\u201d He nudged her. \u201cI told you sheep was a grand idea. Lord Fraser thinks our wool production\u2014regular and high quality\u2014would be just the thing for his business.\u201d</p><p>Aidan managed to calm himself enough to speak. \u201cFraser\u2019s business is thriving, and on a much grander scale. I don\u2019t believe he\u2019d have an honest interest in a farm this size.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA farm this size,\u201d her father mimicked, glaring at him. \u201cAnd what have you got, boy? Nothing, that\u2019s what.\u201d He crossed his arms, puffing with pride. \u201cIf you must know, Fraser said he\u2019s been long without a woman. He heard my Elspeth was fine.\u201d</p><p>Long without a woman. Fury roiled hot in his belly. She was more than a mere commodity\u2014she was precious.</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t love him.\u201d She cast a quick and plaintive glance at Aidan. There was a message in her eyes that he dared not hope was true\u2014that her affections might already be claimed, and by him.</p> <p>\u201cLove? Girl, you don\u2019t have two farthings to rub together. Why do you want love when you can be a lady?\u201d</p><p>Aidan bolted to his feet. \u201cElspeth is a lady. She doesn\u2019t need a rich old husband to prove that to the world.\u201d</p><p>Her father scoffed. \u201cWell, now she\u2019ll be set up like one. And for the rest of her days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSet you up is more like it,\u201d Aidan said, his voice dangerously low.</p><p>Sneering, her father looked him up and down like a piece of rubbish. \u201cWhat business is it of yours?\u201d</p><p>Aidan scowled silently back, thinking the man was right. It wasn\u2019t his business. Would that it were. Would that Elspeth were his responsibility\u2014he\u2019d care for her better than the wealthiest of merchants could.</p><p>\u201cAye, that\u2019s right,\u201d her father mumbled triumphantly.</p><p>Aidan stepped forward, and Elspeth stopped him with an outstretched arm. \u201cBut we\u2019re getting by, Da. The farm is starting to turn around. I don\u2019t need to marry when I\u2019m happy and needed here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to make house, respectable-like. Have a place of your own, a few bairns.\u201d He walked to the door, gesturing for her to follow, as though she should start that very moment. \u201cA man like Fraser will do much for our respectability.\u201d</p><p>Elspeth held her ground and didn\u2019t follow. \u201cI\u2019m perfectly respectable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d her father said with a shrug, \u201cthat\u2019s as may be, but our coffers aren\u2019t so.\u201d</p><p>Aidan watched as her confusion turned to anger, and a matching fury blazed in his chest. If only he had hard proof, rather than a hunch and a crumpled receipt from his hired man. \u201cAnyone but him,\u201d he said, trying to keep his voice level. \u201cThink twice about this. This Fraser is a stranger. And ... I think he\u2019s tied up in a dangerous game.\u201d</p><p>Elspeth gasped. \u201cWho is he? I must know. I\u2019ve been desperate to know.\u201d</p><p>Her eager response gave Aidan pause. The question wasn\u2019t what did he know, rather what did she?</p><p>Ignoring his daughter, the old man glared at Aidan, demanding, \u201cHow do you know aught about him?\u201d</p><p>How to explain that it was just a hunch? \u201cI simply ... know.\u201d</p><p>Her father laughed. \u201cYou simply ... know? His dangerous games? Here\u2019s a dangerous game,\u201d he said, growing serious. \u201cYou sitting unchaperoned with my daughter. I see how you look at her. You just don\u2019t want another man to have her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat might be true. But trust me when I tell you, Fraser isn\u2019t what he seems.\u201d Even a vague link between this merchant and the man with the black pearl was too much. \u201cI have reason to believe he\u2019s tied to the pirate who kidnapped me as a child.\u201d</p><p>Elspeth drew in a sharp breath.</p><p>\u201cPish!\u201d Her father scoffed. \u201cWhat nonsense. You were just a child. An ... an ...\u201d</p><p>Aidan felt Elspeth sidle close behind to give his arm a quick, convulsive squeeze. \u201cAn urchin?\u201d he finished, his voice dangerously calm.</p><p>Her father only sneered. \u201cAye. Your accusation is tripe. All of it, tripe.\u201d</p><p>Elspeth stepped forward. \u201cWe have proof.\u201d</p><p>Aidan shot her a speaking look. She\u2019d seen his papers that day. He didn\u2019t know what she\u2019d read, but he\u2019d rather she told him before getting her father involved. \u201cI\u2019ll find proof,\u201d he said definitively, cutting her off.</p><p>Her father\u2019s placid expression spoke volumes about just whom he did and did not deem trustworthy. \u201cYou won\u2019t find any proof, because I ken a respectable man when I see one.\u201d</p><p>Aidan didn\u2019t care about the slight. He cared that this daft old man, who equated a pricey waistcoat with respectability, was going to sacrifice his only child for financial gain.</p><p>He stepped into the older man\u2019s face. \u201cSo you\u2019re simply going to throw your daughter to a stranger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAidan,\u201d Elspeth whispered, \u201cdon\u2019t fash yourself. I\u2019m sure Da and I will discuss this.\u201d</p><p>He heard the plea in her voice, but couldn\u2019t help it. A great weight was pressing upon his chest. Fury, frustration, disbelief all crushing down, making his lungs tight.</p><p>\u201cYou see? I\u2019m not throwing her. All Elspeth has always wanted was to help out her family.\u201d Her father gave her a careless wink. \u201cIsn\u2019t that right, girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, and you know so well what she wants?\u201d Aidan clenched his fists, wishing for an outlet for his rage.</p><p>\u201cAidan, please.\u201d Elspeth placed a gentle hand at his back, and his tensed muscles flinched at her touch.</p><p>He\u2019d treasured those tender hands, and now they were being stolen from him. Like everything else in his life he\u2019d ever cherished. \u201cYou\u2019re the only family she has,\u201d he said, stabbing a finger toward her father. His jaws were clenched, each breath a labor now. \u201cAnd by now you should know better how to take care of your own self, old man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI care for myself and for her,\u201d her father said, indignant. \u201cHave all these long years, and all by myself, too.\u201d</p><p>Disbelief and outrage roiled in Aidan\u2019s belly. \u201cYou call what you do taking care of her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s been well tended. She has what she needs. The lass even has her own room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruly?\u201d Aidan exploded. \u201cAnd that\u2019s proof that you know her heart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you know of her heart?\u201d her father snapped. \u201cWhat can you know of anything? You\u2019re naught but an indentured, fresh off the boat. Of course your head is turned by the first skirt you see,\u201d he said, waving a dis-missive hand in Elspeth\u2019s direction.</p><p>Aidan\u2019s vision turned red and black. He sprang at the man, punching him squarely on the chin.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Elspeth shrieked as her da fell hard to the ground.</p><p>Her father rubbed his face, working his mouth open and closed. \u201cDamn you. You\u2019ll pay for this.\u201d</p><p>Elspeth\u2019s eyes were wide with shock, and Aidan stared at her, wallowing in his own shame and frustration. Perhaps her father was right. Perhaps he was, and ever would be, nothing more than another man\u2019s servant. Perhaps he\u2019d never be good enough for something\u2014for someone\u2014so fine. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Beth,\u201d he said, his voice hoarse with feeling. \u201cBut you deserve more than that. You are more than that.\u201d</p><p>Eyes narrowing, he turned to glare at her father. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand Elspeth. You may think you do. But really you\u2019re not worthy to call her your daughter.\u201d</p><p>Rubbing his hand, Aidan stormed from the cottage.</p><p>Chapter 21</p><p>He\u2019d lost his head. He\u2019d punched Elspeth\u2019s father. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Aidan scrubbed a hand over his face, trying to clear the memory, but it was no use. It\u2019d hounded him all night. His mind brimmed with episodes he\u2019d rather forget, and this was one more to add to the lot.</p><p>First he\u2019d punched Cormac, and now this. Perhaps Farquharson\u2019s accusations had been right\u2014he was naught but a common laborer, unschooled, violent, and not to be trusted.</p><p>He upped his pace, walking the docks as briskly as he could without breaking into an actual run. The wind whipped off Aberdeen harbor, chilling him to the bone, but he embraced it. Though the weather was turning, he\u2019d fled Dunnottar without a cloak, happy to freeze to death if it meant his mind would finally know peace.</p> <p>He stopped abruptly. He\u2019d reached King\u2019s Quay, marking the general vicinity of the offices of Dougal Fraser and his much-lauded \u201cKnitted Goodes\u201d enterprise. He scowled, thinking how Elspeth\u2019s father had raved about the man\u2019s brilliance, his wealth.</p><p>But a fat purse didn\u2019t make someone a man. And it certainly didn\u2019t entitle this Fraser to Elspeth.</p><p>He stormed up one of the roads that spiked from the harbor, in search of Fraser\u2019s offices, but slowed his pace as a flicker of doubt seized him. Perhaps this knit mer-chant was worthy. Perhaps he\u2019d love and care for Elspeth in a way that Aidan was unable to.</p><p>Aidan made much about a man\u2019s worth, but how could he rate when the mere blatherings of an old man had the capacity to plunge him into a rage?</p><p>He rubbed his knuckles, regretting for the thousandth time how he\u2019d struck Elspeth\u2019s own flesh and blood. Aidan might have spent long years away from civilization, but even he knew that this was not precisely the way to endear himself to a family. Far from it. How her father had glared, as if Aidan were the devil come calling.</p> <p>But Elspeth was so refined, so good. Before they\u2019d been interrupted, he\u2019d come close to imagining himself as someone deserving of such gentility. So close to thinking he would someday be that man.</p><p>Then her father had come in, and with a word, he\u2019d stolen her from Aidan forever. The man wanted her to marry an old merchant, and Aidan could see it. It was the way of the world. Rich men chose their lives and their wives, while men like Aidan served them.</p><p>He\u2019d had enough. This Dougal Fraser might be rich, but as far as Aidan was concerned, Elspeth wasn\u2019t for sale.</p><p>But she was a sweet and gentle creature who\u2019d do as her father bid. So he\u2019d simply do the fighting for her. He\u2019d find some way to discredit the man in the eyes of her father.</p><p>Aidan might not deserve her, but he could ensure that no other unworthy man claimed her either. He\u2019d certainly not stand idly by as she sacrificed her innocence to someone he suspected was old enough to be her grandfather.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t get past the faint nagging suspicion that this particular merchant wasn\u2019t who he pretended to be. Why was he connected with smugglers? And why would he choose Elspeth over a bevy of wealthy, young chits eager to be married into new money? Aidan was determined to find proof of some ill-doing.</p> <p>He looked up at the sign. Dougal Fraser, Knitted Goodes. The building was modest, but it was clean, and located in a relatively upscale area of Aberdeen harbor. On the surface, it was perfectly respectable. But Aidan knew better than most how things weren\u2019t always as they appeared.</p><p>He strode in, determined to get to the bottom of his suspicions. But he\u2019d be discreet. There was no sense in alerting Fraser that he was under suspicion. Aidan would save Elspeth from this absurd alliance. And if he happened upon some clue about his enemy\u2019s whereabouts in the process, all the better.</p><p>The door shut behind him, and he was taken aback by the great rustle and click of sound that engulfed him. He strode down the narrow corridor, peeking in the handful of rooms that sprouted along one side like petals on a half-torn flower. With the exception of a couple of young men whom Aidan assumed were apprentices, the rooms were filled with women and girls, all knitting.</p><p>\u201cIs there something I can help you with?\u201d</p><p>Aidan turned, guessing at once it was none other than Dougal Fraser who\u2019d greeted him. The man was well dressed, with graying hair and a pinched expression. Aidan estimated that he was in his early fifties\u2014 old enough that he should\u2019ve been married already, yet still young enough to be vital. Young enough to father children.</p><p>Aidan clenched his fists. He wanted to snarl at the man, but instead he forced himself to smile his easiest smile, bowing his most cavalier bow. \u201cAye, I suppose you can.\u201d</p><p>Elspeth had recognized this Fraser\u2019s name. She must\u2019ve taken something when she\u2019d riffled through his papers. The woman was clever and cunning, with far more daring than was betrayed by her innocent appearance.</p><p>Aidan put his mind back into the moment, realizing how to approach the answer to Fraser\u2019s question. Gesturing at all the workers, he said, \u201cI see you\u2019ve got labor at the ready. Where do you find it?\u201d He strolled down the hall, trying to look thoughtful. \u201cI\u2019m eager for slaves, you see, and ready to double the current rate.\u201d</p> <p>Though Fraser smiled politely, his eyes remained cold. \u201cWhat business are you in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of yours,\u201d Aidan replied, and upon seeing Fraser\u2019s scowl, he affected a nonchalant laugh. \u201cLook, my only concern is setting up a collection. Of workers,\u201d he added, reading the other man\u2019s confusion. \u201cOr did you think I was eager to get into the stockings business?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorsted stockings are my bread and butter. I\u2019d not mock them.\u201d Fraser\u2019s lips pursed and his expression became chilly. \u201cPray tell, why on earth did you think I of all people might be able to help in your quest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw this address written on a sheet of paper. Next to a name. It was an odd one. What was it?\u201d Aidan snapped his fingers as if trying to summon the memory. \u201cAh yes. The Bishop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome.\u201d Alarm lit Fraser\u2019s features, and he spun on his heel, striding straight for his office. He turned on Aidan the moment the door shut. \u201cYou expect me to help a man I don\u2019t even know?\u201d</p><p>Aidan remained silent. He had no desire to have his name bandied about Aberdeen harbor.</p><p>Red splotches mottled Fraser\u2019s cheeks, betraying his frustration. \u201cNow you become suddenly discreet? Who are you, anyway, and why should I trust you? How can I even know you\u2019re serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious enough.\u201d Aidan shook his sporran, and the clink of coin was so heavy it could be heard through the thick skin of the pouch. Though he jostled it offhandedly, it represented all he owned in the world. He\u2019d hoped to use it to find his enemy, but wouldn\u2019t think twice to spend it helping Elspeth. If his suspicions were borne out, the two goals were one and the same. \u201cNow tell me, where\u2019s this Bishop?\u201d</p><p>The merchant didn\u2019t take his eyes from the pouch. \u201cYou don\u2019t waste time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTime isn\u2019t a luxury I have,\u201d Aidan retorted, feeling for the first time during their meeting that he spoke the truth. \u201cNow, what I\u2019d like to know is why all the secrecy?\u201d He gestured to the four walls of Fraser\u2019s office. \u201cKnowing where to find affordable ... help ... isn\u2019t merely sanctioned, it\u2019s encouraged. And yet, according to my man, you hold clandestine meetings here, under the auspices of dealing in knit goods. Makes a person wonder what you\u2019re really about.\u201d</p><p>Fraser narrowed his eyes, looking dangerously close to snapping.</p><p>Aidan forced himself to calm. It\u2019d do no good to make an enemy of this man. Pasting a stiff smile on his face, he added, \u201cNot I, of course. I prefer subtlety in all things.\u201d</p><p>He needed to help Elspeth by discrediting Fraser to her father, and that meant getting to the bottom of his business. He would not succumb to his temper.</p><p>The merchant considered him for a long while, and Aidan affected his trademark easy nonchalance. He jangled his sporran again for good measure.</p><p>Inhaling deeply, Fraser appeared to come to a decision. He took and dipped his quill, carefully writing something on a sheet of paper. \u201cLet\u2019s say I know where to find laborers. And, say they were held in a ship in Aberdeen harbor.</p><p>You\u2019ll need\u201d\u2014he proffered the paper to Aidan\u2014\u201cword from me.\u201d</p><p>Aidan stared at the sheet. He made out the words Justice Port and a ship\u2019s name\u2014the Endeavor.</p><p>Fraser scoffed. \u201cYou can read this, right?\u201d</p><p>He stared for one furious moment at the merchant\u2019s hands. They were trembling\u2014weak, spotted, and pale. Aidan would die before he let those hands touch Elspeth. He snatched the paper. \u201cAye, I can read your damned scrawl.\u201d He folded it and slipped it into his sporran, forcing a peremptory thank you from between his clenched teeth.</p><p>Fraser raised his brows. \u201cAnd now I think you owe me something.\u201d</p><p>Aidan took his hand from his sporran. \u201cYou won\u2019t see coin until I see laborers.\u201d</p><p>The merchant surprised him by laughing. \u201cA man after my own inclinations. Now go to the harbor. It\u2019s a new ship, with a new captain.\u201d He shook his head in disgust. \u201cMy last contact sank before he\u2019d even left Aberdeen harbor. Man was naught but a careless pirate.\u201d</p><p>He could only be referring to one boat: the one he and Cormac had sunk. Aidan forced a cold smile. \u201cPirates might be skilled, but they\u2019re not always smart.\u201d</p><p>Fraser appeared to like that assessment, and he nodded amiably. \u201cTrue, true. This one got caught up with a woman, and there\u2019s no good ever to come from such an arrangement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yet I hear I\u2019m to offer you felicitations on a recent engagement.\u201d The words were out of Aidan\u2019s mouth before he had a chance to think them through.</p><p>The merchant looked puzzled for a moment, and then pleased. \u201cHeard the news already, eh?\u201d</p><p>The self-satisfied prig made Aidan long to punch something. \u201cAn eligible bachelor like yourself taken off the market? It\u2019s no surprise word got around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, it\u2019s true.\u201d Fraser leaned back in his chair. \u201cI\u2019m to be married. At first, I thought her a plain-faced creature. But something about her appealed.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPlain?\u201d Aidan fisted his hands. There was an unassuming simplicity to Elspeth\u2019s beauty, but she was hardly plain\u2014Aidan just called it natural.</p><p>\u201cWell, that was what I\u2019d thought at first.\u201d He leaned on his desk, confiding, \u201cI\u2019d never marry an ugly girl, you see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do see.\u201d Aidan nodded, barely seeing the man through the film of red that\u2019d dropped before his eyes. He imagined the dozen different ways in which he could beat this swine to a pulp.</p> <p>\u201cBut she struck me as a bright sort of girl,\u201d Fraser continued in an annoyingly musing sort of tone. \u201cThough very quiet. I imagine it indicates a biddable nature.\u201d</p><p>Aidan gritted his teeth in a smile. Biddable was the last word he\u2019d used to describe Elspeth. \u201cFound yourself a tractable girl, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed. Or so she\u2019ll be, once I get her out from her father\u2019s thumb and under mine. The man\u2019s a doddering old fellow.\u201d Fraser tapped his head. \u201cBit dim in the upper works too, if you ask me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s remarkable how dim-witted some folk can be.\u201d Aidan forced his voice to be light, adopting his blithe mask to conceal what felt like a giant fist crushing his chest.</p><p>\u201cJust so!\u201d Fraser smiled, looking at ease now, nodding jovially. \u201cYou seem a bright lad. A man after my own heart.\u201d He began to turn his attention to the papers on his desk. Shooing Aidan toward the door, he said, \u201cNow get yourself to the docks.\u201d He paused, giving Aidan an avuncular wink. \u201cTell them the Bishop sent you.\u201d</p> <p>The Bishop. Aggravation fueled Aidan\u2019s stride. Wealthy men and their ridiculous flights of fancy.</p><p>He smelled Aberdeen harbor before he saw it, the stench summoning a churn of emotions. The heavy scent of salt, oil casks, and decaying fish would forever remind him how it had felt to dock as a free man, returned to Scotland once more.</p><p>But it also recalled a darker, more distant time, when he\u2019d been a young boy, torn from his homeland for what he thought would be forever. His captors had pulled the sack from his head, putting him face-to-face with the man he\u2019d sworn as his enemy above all others.</p><p>As a lad, he\u2019d heard stories of pirates, but never had he pictured them like that man. He\u2019d always imagined they might be dashing, or handsome, or perhaps even grotesquely ugly. But the man who\u2019d ordered his capture had been decidedly average, neither tall nor short, with only a black pearl in his ear to mark him as anything other than ordinary. And somehow it was his unremarkable looks that\u2019d made him seem all the crueler.</p><p>Aidan turned onto one of the larger streets leading down to the harbor. He girded himself for the inevitable onslaught of memories. Forever, he\u2019d carry a picture of the docks as they\u2019d receded from his young view. Forever the sight of them would invoke the old heartbreak and terror as the spires of Aberdeen, and then the coast of Scotland itself, had faded into a vast gray nothing.</p><p>He\u2019d girded himself, but there was nothing to prepare him for what he saw docked at King\u2019s Quay. A wave of horror crippled him.</p> <p>It was the ship, the one captained by the man with the pearl earring.</p><p>He shook his head, scrubbing a hand roughly along his jaw. Not the ship. This one bore a different name\u2014 Endeavor, painted in a cheery red script\u2014not Le\u00f3n de Oro. He was staring at an exact replica of the boat that\u2019d stolen him thirteen long years past.</p><p>Sailors rarely changed the names of their ships. Pirates were a particularly superstitious lot, and the man with the black pearl had been no different. Aidan recalled the rules: no whistling, no cutting of hair or nails. No pigs, nor rabbit, nor salmon. With ice in his belly, he recalled the chimney boy who\u2019d been tossed overboard to drown, his crime that he\u2019d been born with red hair.</p><p>Despite the resemblance, Aidan told himself he was jumping to conclusions, that the two ships weren\u2019t the same. Endeavor was a rare craft, an exotic Spanish beauty known as a xebec, and she was fast, her foremast raking forward as though the ship itself were eager to slice through the wind. She bore a sleekly pointing bow, a hefty stern, and a wide hull exactly like the one in which he\u2019d been imprisoned, laboring for weeks in a grim darkness that\u2019d reeked of mildew and tar. But it seemed more than a coincidence.</p><p>Recovering from his shock, he realized he was striding straight for it, his hand braced on the hilt of his sword. He tempered his impulses, forcing himself to halt. He\u2019d need to bide his time\u2014his ghost wasn\u2019t aboard this ship.</p><p>His mind raced. The Endeavor was well guarded, sailors swarming on the deck and in the ratlines like flies over a mound of dung. She may not have been his ship, but she was so very like it that a deep foreboding crept through his gut. Elspeth was being wed to a man involved with this.</p><p>He just needed to prove hers was a bad match to a bad man.</p><p>Seeing a shadow, he stiffened. Someone was approaching. The day was hazy and overcast, but still, he could make out a gray shadow wavering along the rotting timbers of the dock.</p> <p>He put his hand on his hilt and canted his elbow out hard. There\u2019d be no mistaking the threat in his posture.</p><p>The shadow made straight for him, its amorphous shape speaking to a short, cloaked figure. He peered out the corners of his eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat have you discovered?\u201d asked a familiar voice. The sound aroused much ire, a goodly dose of anxiety, plus a maddening pleasure, all melding together into a blade that cut straight to his heart.</p><p>Elspeth.</p><p>Chapter 22</p><p>He grabbed her arm. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>She flinched away, startled at the rough grip. \u201cI followed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he said, smoothing her arm where he\u2019d grabbed her. He visibly tried to clear the anger from his face, which left him looking pinched. \u201cWhat were you\u2014?\u201d</p><p>A commotion got their attention\u2014a handful of sailors riled up for what was looking like a brawl\u2014and he swept her away, heading down the harbor and up the first alleyway. It was a dead end, and he ducked them into a shadowy corner. \u201cWhat were you thinking?\u201d he repeated in a low hiss. \u201cYou could get hurt.\u201d</p><p>She ignored his concerns, her voice vibrating with excitement. \u201cYou saw him, didn\u2019t you? Dougal Fraser?\u201d Aidan would help her, she knew. He would save her from this ridiculous marriage.</p><p>\u201cI saw him,\u201d he answered in a tight voice. \u201cAnd you\u2019re lucky he didn\u2019t see you, though I\u2019d like to know how you even heard of the man.\u201d He paused, taking in her outfit, and made a face that was half amused, half exasperated. \u201cWhat are you thinking, skulking about, and in this ridiculous old cloak?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else am I to do? My father is unrelenting. He doesn\u2019t believe that Fraser is a bad man.\u201d She clutched at his shirtsleeves. \u201cIs he? What do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do I know?\u201d Aidan\u2019s narrowing eyes alarmed her a little. But the sight was exhilarating too. She\u2019d glimpsed Aidan vulnerable, yet now, the way he was taking charge, she saw just how powerful he was.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, a bit breathless. They stood hidden in a corner, and the darkness etched black shadows along his cheeks, under his jaw. His chest was solid, and his heat radiated to her, and she felt she might be lost, consumed by his burning energy. Aidan was a force\u2014knowing he was intent on safeguarding her over all other women was a thrill beyond measure. \u201cWhen Da told us about him, it seemed you knew something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat of you?\u201d he demanded. \u201cI think you\u2019re the one who knows something. And I think it has to do with a little something you stole from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStole... something?\u201d Her voice sounded weak to her ears. Stolen something indeed. A sheet of paper that was currently chafing inside her bodice.</p><p>He took her chin and gently tipped it to the right and left, studying her. \u201cVery pretty, Beth. But it won\u2019t work on me.\u201d He gave it a gentle pinch. \u201cNow tell. Where is it? This Dougal Fraser is up to no good, and I need to find proof. I\u2019ll start by looking at whatever it is you took from my papers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll find proof.\u201d If Aidan thought to embark alone on an intrigue\u2014one intended for her own good, no less\u2014 he had another thing coming. \u201cAnd your paper is safe with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if your father reads it?\u201d He let go her chin and stepped closer. \u201cIt\u2019s not safe if he can find it in the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not in the house.\u201d</p><p>He stepped closer still, and something in her belly sparked in response. \u201cThe paper is on your person?\u201d</p><p>She imagined his intention had been to make a threatening impression, but his proximity was having quite the opposite effect. \u201cPerhaps,\u201d she said, not budging her eyes from his. She felt something inside her smolder, and willed it to burn clear in her gaze.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d he mimicked. \u201cYou little fox, you\u2019re more than folk take you for, do you know that?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged, her lip trembling in a coy smile.</p><p>He took one last step forward, till his stomach was pressed against hers. \u201cShall I frisk you, then?\u201d</p><p>He was a solid wall of hot muscle pressed along her thighs, against her breasts, inflaming her till she thought she might come apart from her trembling. \u201cIf you must.\u201d</p><p>He raised a hand to stroke up the side of her torso, and she answered instinctively by lifting her arms to rest on his shoulders. His eyes grew dark, his voice ragged. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with me? You\u2019re being wed to a criminal. I feel in my gut that the man whose face has haunted me for years is in reach. Yet all I can think is that I want to kiss you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKiss me?\u201d Her voice cracked as he began to nuzzle her neck.</p><p>His hand roved her torso eagerly now, drifting thrillingly close to the swell of her breast. \u201cI\u2019ll stop, if you wish it,\u201d he said, his voice a low rasp.</p><p>She opened her mouth to speak, but nothing came out. His mouth slowed, hovering hot over her throat. Oh God, did he think she wanted him to stop? How to show him she wanted very much for him to kiss her once more? She did as she imagined any romantic heroine would do, and pulling apart from him, she tilted up her face and shut her eyes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He stroked her cheek. \u201cI want you, and you want me too, don\u2019t you? Sweet Beth. There\u2019s naught you seem to fear.\u201d</p><p>She risked a peek from beneath her lashes. \u201cWhat I fear is that ... that you might not kiss me again after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that,\u201d he said in a hoarse whisper. \u201cNever that.\u201d He swooped in, taking her mouth in a hot-blooded kiss.</p> <p>Elspeth\u2019s world exploded. She opened herself to him, melting into him, welcoming him, exploring with mouth and teeth and tongue, like a woman starved. Like a wanton.</p><p>The thought that she might be a wanton aroused her all the more.</p><p>A dam broke deep inside her, letting free every passion she\u2019d ever harbored. Twining her fingers in his hair, she crushed her body as close as she could against his. She felt his startled laugh turn to a groan in her mouth, and it inflamed her desire to a fever pitch.</p><p>He gradually began to slow the kiss, gradually and regretfully pulling away. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She opened her mouth to protest, and he laughed low, interrupting her by saying, \u201cRather, we should. Just not here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh,\u201d she said, relieved.</p><p>Leaning her weight into him, she gazed up, a smile in her eyes for this man who seemed to soften for none but her. One needed only to see his scars, testifying to a lifetime of beatings, or imagine his escape, or his adventures across the sea, to know Aidan was the most dangerous of rogues. And yet she felt protected in his arms.</p><p>She\u2019d felt such dread when her father had first spoken the name Dougal Fraser. She knew she should summon that dread now. She should, even now, be jumping into action, searching for clues, fighting for her freedom. Yet she and Aidan both stood, mesmerized by this happy dream from which they dared not wake.</p><p>She reached to cup his cheek for a moment, and as she stroked back down, she felt a strange, hard ridge in his breast pocket. She canted her head, giving him a quizzical look. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>His eyes had been hazy from the kiss, and she watched as they cleared. He gave her a lazy smile and kissed the tip of her nose. \u201cI got you something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d She became woozy with panicked selfconsciousness. Aidan was the first man\u2014the first person, really\u2014to give her gifts so freely. The thought that he\u2019d bought her something else had her feeling embarrassed. \u201cSomething?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMost women receive such news with some degree of pleasure.\u201d He stroked the side of her hotly blushing cheek. \u201cLook at you, flying your colors. I can see your blush, even in the shadows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to get me anything,\u201d she said stiffly.</p><p>\u201cI know it. But surprise is the nature of the whole enterprise, isn\u2019t it?\u201d With a finger he tipped her face to his. \u201cDo you not generally get gifts?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNot generally, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we\u2019re a pair,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause I don\u2019t generally give them.\u201d Not publicly, at least.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to get me anything,\u201d she repeated.</p><p>He stared at her a moment, dumbfounded. Why did the woman feel so blasted uncomfortable? It was such a simple damned gift he\u2019d gotten her.</p><p>He looked over his shoulder, but there wasn\u2019t a soul to be seen in their alleyway, and so he turned his attention back to her. \u201cShut your eyes,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard me.\u201d Her eyelids fluttered nervously shut, and he pulled the thin, velvet-wrapped package from his pocket. Brushing wisps of hair from her face, he gently placed a pair of spectacles on her nose.</p><p>Gasping, her hands flew up to her face, fingering the frames. \u201cWhat have you\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush. And keep your eyes shut for the full effect.\u201d He reached around, tying the thin ribbon that secured them to her head. \u201cThere. You may open them.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, warmed by her look of wide-eyed amazement.</p><p>\u201cOh, Aidan.\u201d She studied him up and down, outlining with her finger the path of her gaze. \u201cOh,\u201d she said again, \u201cOh, Aidan!\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d given gifts before in his life, but he\u2019d always been careful to remain anonymous. When he was enslaved, he\u2019d always found a way to help the younger, more innocent lads. But such gestures could be misconstrued as weakness, and so his help had always come in secret. He\u2019d never been there to see the moment of surprise, the realization of pleasure. \u201cDo you like them?\u201d</p><p>She fingered his shirt. \u201cDid you know, there are the tiniest wee threads that make up the weave of this fabric? I see them, even in these shadows.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, gratified to see her so animated. His heart soared to think this happiness of hers had been his doing. \u201cAye, I knew it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThough I think they\u2019re just for reading,\u201d she said, looking beyond him, to the mouth of the alley. \u201cThey appear to\u201d\u2014she alternately peered up over, then through, the lenses\u2014\u201cdistort things that are far away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDear Beth.\u201d He took his index finger and gently pushed the spectacles all the way up the bridge of her nose. \u201cI asked if you like them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I do,\u201d she said, meeting his gaze in utter earnest. He noted the telltale uncertainty that generally preceded one of her blushes. \u201cBut I\u2019m afraid\u201d\u2014she touched a finger to one edge of the spectacles\u2014\u201cI\u2019m afraid I must look a sight.\u201d</p><p>He studied her, a smile broad on his face. Her eyes were a bit magnified, those mysterious yellow flecks enhanced, leaving her looking more than ever as though she could see all, understand all. \u201cYou do look a bit owlish,\u201d he added with a laugh. \u201cBut a very pretty owl indeed.\u201d</p><p>She smiled back at him, and he was pleased to see her self-consciousness beginning to ebb. \u201cI\u2019m tempted to give you a gift every day of the week,\u201d he told her. \u201cJust to get you in the habit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, Aidan.\u201d She shook her head vehemently. \u201cThese are too much as it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSilly woman.\u201d Reaching around, he gently untied the ribbon. \u201cIt was long past time you got a decent pair of spectacles. I see you, straining to do your tallies by firelight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are a wonder.\u201d Taking them from his hand, she held them out of the shadows, catching the light, tilting them this way and that. \u201cThis ... this is more than I ever could have imagined.\u201d</p><p>Her sweet smile had him fantasizing that the this she referred to wasn\u2019t the pair of spectacles, but rather the two of them.</p><p>\u201cBut promise you won\u2019t buy me anything more,\u201d she said, earnestness drawing a faint line between her brows. \u201cI don\u2019t need anything more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d He\u2019d spotted a dress in Aberdeen with pretty blue and yellow stitching about the neck that he thought might bring out the color of her eyes. \u201cOn the contrary. I think there\u2019s much indeed that you need.\u201d</p><p>She raised a saucy brow, and a laugh exploded from him, surprised by the flash of heat in her eyes. \u201cYou wicked, wee minx,\u201d he muttered, placing a kiss on the top of her head. \u201cClear that look from your face, or you\u2019ll find me kissing you again.\u201d</p><p>She laughed with him, and the carefree sound of it loosened something in his chest.</p><p>\u201cI need to hear more of that.\u201d At her inquisitive look, he said, \u201cYour laughter. I don\u2019t hear enough of it.\u201d</p><p>The joy drained from her face, and he regretted his words. It appeared he\u2019d only reminded Elspeth of her current worries.</p><p>\u201cAye, you nearly made me forget my troubles. What did you find out about Fraser?\u201d She gave him a hard look. \u201cBut you\u2019ve got troubles too. Why won\u2019t you tell me of them? I can help you find your man. And where, pray tell, did you ever find the money to buy me such a lavish gift?\u201d</p><p>He stiffened. \u201cNot lavish.\u201d But she spoke the truth: the money he\u2019d spared for her gift would\u2019ve been better spent tracking his enemy.</p><p>Money. It seemed always to come down to money. She was being married off to some aging blackguard, because of money.</p><p>\u201cMy finances are not your concern, Beth.\u201d As if he had any finances to speak of. All he had to show for his life was a jealously guarded pouch, filled with hard-earned coin intended to create the illusion that he was a man of worth.</p><p>Again, it came down to worth, to worthiness.</p><p>He needed to remember what he was about, and that was tracking the man with the black pearl. Until he found and bested the man who\u2019d stolen him, his life wouldn\u2019t be truly restored.</p><p>But once he destroyed his enemy, he could get on with the rest of it, starting over, making a real life as a real man would. He\u2019d start by saving Elspeth from this suspicious match. Then he\u2019d make his own money, set himself up with a good living so he could care for his woman.</p><p>And none of that would happen with him mooning like a love-struck idiot. She\u2019d distracted him, but it was time to get down to business. He narrowed his eyes.</p><p>\u201cNow there\u2019s a little matter of something I think you\u2019re hiding on your person.\u201d</p><p>She looked like a startled doe, and he forced himself to keep a straight face. It\u2019d do no good to scare her. Though, he thought with a grin, he might enjoy a little fun.</p><p>The hard years had honed his instincts, and those instincts told him the papers she\u2019d stolen were hidden somewhere on her person. \u201cYou\u2019re wicked,\u201d he told her. \u201cAnd do you know why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He\u2019d expected her to look shocked, but mostly she looked amazed.</p><p>It spurred him on. Staring at her parted lips, he said, \u201cYou distracted me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did,\u201d he said, chuckling at the disbelief in her voice. He couldn\u2019t help it, he had to touch her again. Had to kiss her, and smell her, and taste her. He leaned in to nuzzle her, and pointing his fingertip onto the side of her throat, he whispered along her skin, \u201cYou had me looking here.\u201d</p><p>She made a gratifying little gasping sound, and he swept his hands down to clutch her firmly about her waist, tugging her closer. His cock stiffened at once, and he pressed into her, his flesh chafing against the wool of his plaid, straining to press through the layers of her skirts, to the soft, innocent flesh hidden beneath. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd here,\u201d he said, kissing along her collarbone.</p><p>He had the distant thought that he should have a care. They stood in the open, in a seedy alley off Aberdeen harbor, him pressing her into a darkened corner, his desire precipitous, quickly spinning to a point of no return.</p><p>But he couldn\u2019t summon a care. All he knew was her precious body, yielding against his. It took the full force of his will not to succumb to the lust that pounded through him and simply ruck her skirts up above her waist and take her there, hidden in the shadows.</p> <p>He stroked a hand up her torso, running his thumb along the soft flesh of her breast. \u201cAnd here.\u201d</p><p>She drew in a sharp breath, but didn\u2019t stop him, and so he kept tracing his thumb up and down, his pressure growing just a bit firmer, his touch approaching just a bit closer to the tip of her breast.</p><p>\u201cYou ... you were looking there too?\u201d she asked, her voice breathy and shallow.</p><p>\u201cOh, most definitely.\u201d</p><p>She gave a little self-conscious wriggle. \u201cB-but, there\u2019s not ... I\u2019m not ... I\u2019m so...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAh,\u201d he said, guessing her fears. He brought his other hand up to caress her other side, calming her nervous body. Kissing up her throat to her ear, he whispered, \u201cIs it you think you\u2019re too thin?\u201d</p><p>He heard her breathing change, felt her reluctant nod.</p><p>\u201cSilly, perfect, foolish woman.\u201d He kissed his way along her jaw to her mouth, where he hovered over her lips. \u201cYou see, Beth, you aren\u2019t the only wicked one. I\u2019ve been looking here\u201d\u2014he cupped one breast\u2014\u201cand here\u201d\u2014then the other\u2014\u201csince first we met.\u201d</p><p>He touched his lips to hers just as he gave a gentle squeeze to her breasts. They nestled in his palms as though they\u2019d been made just for him. \u201cPerfect, I told you.\u201d</p><p>He could feel her hardened nipples through the fabric of her bodice, and rubbed his open palms over them, then closed his hands to squeeze again.</p><p>There was a faint answering crinkle. His stolen paper. And regretfully, he remembered his purpose. It was perhaps the only excuse strong enough to bring him to his senses, recalling where they were, pulling him from this lusty haze.</p> <p>Aidan chuckled. \u201cPerfect for my hands, but not perfect enough to conceal my papers.\u201d</p><p>She pulled away, and her face was an endearing tangle of emotions: humor on her lips, embarrassment in her cheeks, and lust in her eyes. \u201cYou cheated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted my paper back.\u201d His gaze was heavy on her as she reached in her bodice to pull it out. He vowed, someday he\u2019d have the right to reach his hand under that bodice. To strip it off himself, if that was his desire. He knew Beth would have him\u2014he saw it in those allknowing eyes, felt it in her kisses. He just needed to finish what he\u2019d set out to do, and then he would make her his. \u201cI\u2019ve gone long years without getting what I want. But no longer.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 23</p><p>Elspeth shivered. He\u2019d spoken such dark, such rousing, such thrillingly sinful words. Had he meant he wanted her? Might he want more than just stolen kisses?</p><p>Putting a hand on Aidan\u2019s arm, she peeked past him. There were distant shouts and the faraway clopping of the occasional horse, but otherwise they were unseen in their dark corner.</p><p>Looking up at him, she slowly hooked a finger in the front of her bodice. She felt apart from her body, as though she were watching the actions of another woman. This other, sensual Elspeth moved lazily, her eyelids heavy, her wanting smoldering in her gaze.</p><p>She tugged at her bodice, pulling it a little away from her skin, freeing her naked breasts from their tight cocoon of linen. She wasn\u2019t bared to the world, yet cool air kissed her flesh, and a ripple of pleasure skimmed her body, leaving her skin buzzing and hot.</p> <p>This sultry Elspeth reached in and grasped the edge of Aidan\u2019s paper. She\u2019d hidden it tucked against her bare flesh, and as she slowly pulled it free, it brushed along her nipple, until every inch of her skin became hotter, tighter, the ache for his touch unbearable.</p><p>Aidan swallowed hard. He adjusted his plaid, and though she was desperate to steal a peek at what she\u2019d felt pressed against her body, she found she wasn\u2019t yet that daring.</p><p>He cleared his throat, asking in a gratifyingly disconcerted voice, \u201cWhich of your books taught you how to do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s from my own imagination.\u201d She gave him a slow sinner\u2019s smile that would\u2019ve made the sauciest of literary heroines proud.</p><p>They froze, the sound of approaching chatter a splash of cold water on them both. Aidan cursed under his breath as a group of men\u2014fresh from the tavern, by the smell of them\u2014wandered into their alley.</p><p>She clamped the paper to her breast, but not before one of them spotted it.</p><p>\u201cOi, lads! The pretty lady\u2019s goin\u2019 tae read to us.\u201d Drunken laughter echoed in the cramped space.</p><p>Aidan spun, concealing her neatly behind his back, and like a mythical beast from a folktale, he transformed into something larger and infinitely more powerful. He pitched his voice loud and low, and it echoed off the dank stone, shrinking the alleyway into something smaller and more perilous. \u201cIf you value your hides, you\u2019ll keep moving.\u201d</p><p>It was the voice he\u2019d have used on board ship. It shocked her, amazed her, took her breath away.</p><p>The men scattered like rats.</p><p>\u201cCome,\u201d he said, speaking once more in the gentle tone reserved for her. \u201cLet\u2019s away from here.\u201d He took the paper, and tucking her hand in the crook of his elbow, he quoted the old adage, \u201c \u2018The day has eyes, but the night has ears,\u2019 and right now we find ourselves somewhere twixt the two. Best to talk as we walk.\u201d</p><p>He guided her from the alleyway, his stride confident, but not so swift as to draw attention. She trembled, her nerves still jangling from unspent lust, still shaken from the sudden appearance of the men, and he pulled her closer to steady her.</p><p>She knew he was leading her home, and her spirits plummeted. It would mean they\u2019d soon have to part.</p><p>With their shared kisses, the dream of one day sharing a home with Aidan had come to life in her breast. But today, she and Aidan would say good-bye instead, and she\u2019d have to face her father and the specter of her betrothal to Fraser.</p><p>She desperately hoped they\u2019d find solid proof that the old merchant wasn\u2019t as reputable as he seemed. Because if they didn\u2019t, her father would insist on proceeding with her wedding. And she had no choice but to do as her father made her\u2014it was the way of the world. If they found nothing to damn Fraser, she\u2019d have no choice but to marry the man.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s study this as we walk,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cI\u2019m afraid we won\u2019t have a chance to read it when I reach home.\u201d</p><p>With a tight nod, he navigated out from the shadows, and they traveled in silence till the buildings became sparser, gradually replaced by rolling countryside. When nobody but distant cattle were there to overhear, Aidan unfolded the paper she\u2019d stolen from him.</p><p>WARRANT OF ENTRY</p><p>BRIDGETOWN PORT, BARBADOS</p><p>CAPTAIN WM. DERBY-PHIPPS</p><p>THE ENDEAVOR (ORIG. LE\u00d3N DE ORO)</p><p>TYPE: XEBEC, 160 TONNES BURTHEN, 18 GUNS</p><p>CREW: 95</p><p>GUARANTOR: DOUGAL FRASER, KING\u2019S QUAY, ABERDEEN</p><p>She\u2019d read it a thousand times, but it was just as meaningless to her as it\u2019d been on the first. She mused quietly, \u201cWhatever could it mean that Fraser is in league with a British traitor?\u201d</p><p>He stopped abruptly, and their arms tugged against each other. \u201cYou know this man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I do,\u201d she said, wondering at his intensity. \u201cWho doesn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d He spoke through gritted teeth, intense focus in his eyes.</p><p>She put a hand to her heart. He\u2019d spent over half his life out of the country\u2014there was no way he\u2019d have heard the songs, known the tale. \u201cOh, Aidan, of course you don\u2019t know. Captain William Derby-Phipps was a famous traitor.\u201d She peered into his eyes. \u201cBut why do you care? What does the connection mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s the man who took me. He\u2019s my man with the black pearl.\u201d</p><p>Her heart hammered with excitement. Might they find their proof of Fraser\u2019s dishonesty and Aidan\u2019s revenge on this one sheet of paper? \u201cHow can you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis.\u201d He pointed to a single word. \u201cThis is my proof.\u201d</p><p>Xebec. She stared at the strange, foreign word, perplexed. \u201cIs that a man\u2019s name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, and she could hear the anticipation growing in his voice. \u201cIt\u2019s a type of ship. A rare Spanish ship. There\u2019s one currently docked in Aberdeen harbor, and though it sails under a different name\u201d\u2014he pointed to the names, the Endeavor, the Le\u00f3n de Oro\u2014\u201cI think it\u2019s the same one that took me.\u201d</p><p>Though loath to interrupt, she had to ask the question on her tongue. \u201cIs it common to change a ship\u2019s name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHardly,\u201d he said, with a baffled shake of his head. \u201cHe\u2019d have been hard-pressed to change the name. Sailors are quite superstitious about such things. He must\u2019ve had some good reason\u2014avoiding the authorities, evading his enemies.\u201d He gave a brittle laugh. \u201cI imagine he made</p><p>quite a number of enemies in his time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, like me. Because I\u2019m going to kill him.\u201d A deadly calm stole over his face. \u201cTell me about this Cap-tain Derby-Phipps.\u201d</p><p>She pursed her lips, summoning the old tale to mind. \u201cDerby-Phipps captained an English ship, during the Thirty Years War,\u201d she began. \u201cSailing alongside a small Dutch fleet, he encountered a sea of Spanish galleons and certain defeat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd, let me guess, our good captain simply turned tail?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrecisely. Those of his crew he couldn\u2019t convince to turn pirate, he simply killed. But he later stole a Spanish ship and inexplicably delivered the bounty to the British.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot inexplicable at all,\u201d Aidan said, interrupting her. His eyes danced with an excitement she felt swell in her own breast. \u201cWhat else to do with so great a prize? The Dutch wouldn\u2019t have touched it, and the Spaniards would\u2019ve killed him. That left bonny old England.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIndeed,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd bonny old England gave him the Spanish ship and a pardon for his trouble. There\u2019s even a song about him,\u201d she said, and sang a few bars of the old marching tune.</p><p>My name is Captain Will, oh Will,</p><p>I turned pirate when I killed good men,</p> <p>Their worthy blood did spill.</p><p>Their worthy blood did spill, did spill,</p><p>Their worthy blood did spill.</p><p>He laughed, and she felt they were both intoxicated by their discovery. \u201cI said you looked like an owl with your spectacles, but I didn\u2019t know you sang like one too.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a swat. \u201cI don\u2019t know that that\u2019s a compliment.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAlways, luvvie.\u201d He swatted her right back, on her bottom. He shook his head, retreating into his thoughts. \u201cAnd that\u2019s my man with the black pearl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow odd,\u201d she said, her musing tone a match to his. \u201cA man wearing jewelry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. Sailors are a superstitious lot, fearing shipwreck above all things. They think the only way to ensure a Christian burial is to wear the cost of their coffin on their person. Gold, silver, gems ... all worn in earrings, mostly. I\u2019m sure this man\u2014and much of his crew\u2014is no different. His was a black pearl, though, and I\u2019ve not seen its like since.\u201d</p><p>She took the paper from his hand. \u201cThis is it,\u201d she said somberly. \u201cThis will be our proof. We\u2019re so close now. We only need evidence of the captain\u2019s piracy, and my father will be sure to cancel the engagement.\u201d</p><p>They crested the final hill on the path to her house. She slowed her pace, until her feet gradually came to a stop. Reaching home meant bidding farewell to Aidan.</p><p>She stared down into the glen, looking blindly at the stone fence he\u2019d built for them. She\u2019d never again be able to look at that square of pastureland without thinking of him.</p> <p>\u201cMy fence work is done,\u201d he said, as though reading her mind.</p><p>Their tutoring work was at an end, as was his work on their farm. Would he be done with her too? Aidan\u2019s enemy was within his reach. Would he find and kill the man, only to disappear from her life forever?</p><p>Unable to look him in the eye, she stared instead at her flock of dull-eyed beasts, feeding in the distance. \u201cDoes that mean I\u2019ll no longer see you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I might come back,\u201d he said casually.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t bring herself to look at him, and he laughed, and her cheeks broiled with embarrassment.</p><p>\u201cSilly woman, look at me.\u201d He cupped the side of her face, and when she met his eyes, he told her, \u201cHere\u2019s a secret, luvvie. I despise milk.\u201d</p><p>She thought of all the cups she\u2019d brought him, and all the times he\u2019d come to visit, asking for more. She saw her amazed realization reflected in his smile.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy else do you think I\u2019ve been coming around? It\u2019s because I want to see you. Why else find a way to break from Fraser, but to be with you.\u201d</p> <p>It was her turn to give a rueful laugh, and he placed a quick kiss on her smiling lips.</p><p>He pulled away, glancing around. \u201cYour father is surely about somewhere. Now, are we of a mind, or do you need me to promise to build you another fence? I don\u2019t know that my back can take it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she answered sheepishly. \u201cWe\u2019re of a mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Because we\u2019ve yet to figure why he\u201d\u2014he shook his piece of paper\u2014\u201cis in league with Fraser. I can\u2019t simply storm the Endeavor and kill this Captain Will. If we discover the nature of their business together, perhaps we\u2019ll find your evidence and my opportunity, in one fell swoop.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t need to think. Only one obvious path unfolded ahead of her.</p><p>Heroines stood by their men, and she\u2019d stand by hers. \u201cWith this betrothal, I have an entr\u00e9e into Fraser\u2019s inner circle. I can discover the nature of their business, find out when and how you can gain access to the man with the black pearl. Unquestionably, I must proceed with my father\u2019s plan.\u201d</p><p>Aidan looked taken aback. \u201cUnquestionably, you\u2019ll do nothing of the sort. God\u2019s bones, Beth, the sooner we put a stop to that nonsense the better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t you see?\u201d It was all so clear, coming to her in a flash. \u201cFor now, I must proceed with the engagement. Would you like to hear my plan?\u201d</p><p>He took a step backward, as if staggering from a blow. \u201cYou can\u2019t actually tell me you\u2019ll encourage his pursuit of your hand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the only way to find out more.\u201d</p><p>Aidan\u2019s expression was stark. \u201cHow can you agree to marry him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t actually be marrying him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t actually accept this engagement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need clues as to how to infiltrate Captain Will\u2019s network,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is the best way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI admire your courage,\u201d he said, his voice tight. \u201cYou have an unusual habit of not showing fear. But this is too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have nothing to fear with you by my side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be by your side if Fraser takes you to the marriage bed.\u201d He shot her a bitter look, and it was like looking into the face of pain.</p><p>\u201cGood heavens, but it won\u2019t come to that.\u201d It was just like a man not to listen to her plan, focusing instead on a rival for her virtue. \u201cThis is merely a ruse,\u201d she explained slowly. \u201cOne that will end when we discover hard evidence.\u201d</p><p>She began to walk down the hill toward her cottage. She had a plan to enact, whether Aidan liked it or not.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t one of your books,\u201d he said, catching up to her. \u201cNot every tale has a happy ending. If you agree to this, who\u2019s to say you\u2019ll find proof of anything beyond what\u2019s apparent to the eye\u2014what if Fraser really is just an old merchant, inadvertently caught up in something over his head, and in possession of a fat bank account he\u2019ll use to pay your father\u2019s debts? What then? Or, who\u2019s to say the man won\u2019t simply ignore the engagement, and come and steal you away instead?\u201d</p><p>She stopped on the hillside. \u201cThis may not be one of my books, but neither is it a page from your story. Not everyone is stolen away,\u201d she said gently. \u201cI shall be perfectly safe. Steal me away? Really, Aidan. My father would never allow such a thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would never allow it,\u201d he grumbled. \u201cI won\u2019t allow any of it.\u201d</p><p>Determined, she took a different tack. \u201cThis is all idle speculation. My father has set my course. Until we find evidence of any wrongdoing, there is no way he\u2019ll break the betrothal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t I have a say?\u201d</p><p>She bristled. He had a say, and more than a say\u2014his thoughts and actions affected her more than he could ever know. But she saw the way of it clearly, and he didn\u2019t seem to understand.</p><p>She could act as bravely as he, and with as much success. She could solve both their problems at once, if only he\u2019d trust her.</p><p>She stuck with the argument that, sadly, was closest to the truth. \u201cMy father has made his decision. I\u2019m afraid you don\u2019t have a choice. I have no choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s always a choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, of all men, know that\u2019s not true.\u201d She sighed, tired of arguing. She knew her plan was their only option. If he disagreed, she\u2019d have to proceed on her own\u2014he\u2019d see the wisdom of her actions later. \u201cI know my father. Whatever your feelings for me, you have no claim. There can be no claim.\u201d</p><p>She turned and was continuing down the hill when she felt him grab her. He spun her, the look on his face dangerous. He held her shoulders in his hands, and she couldn\u2019t look away.</p><p>\u201cIf you think I\u2019ll stand idly by while you put yourself in harm\u2019s way. Beth ...\u201d Fury made his words come haltingly. \u201cDammit, Beth, if you think I can watch as you give yourself ... to another man\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs everything all right here?\u201d</p><p>She recognized Angus\u2019s slow baritone. Aidan\u2019s grip eased, and though he reluctantly let her go, anger sparked in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d she said, looking up to face the farmer. \u201cI have the situation well in hand.\u201d</p><p>Aidan gave a bitter laugh. \u201cSo you think.\u201d</p><p>Angus loomed on the hilltop, and though he only held a spade, the burly man somehow managed to make the thing look like the most intimidating of weapons. He pinned Aidan with an unwavering glare. \u201cIs the MacAlpin bothering you? Never before have I heard you shout so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is bothering me.\u201d She met and held Aidan\u2019s eye. \u201cOr rather, his closed mind is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not bothering her,\u201d Aidan said angrily. \u201cI\u2019m talking sense into her.\u201d</p><p>She raised her brows. \u201cAnd you\u2019re just about done?\u201d</p><p>Aidan reached out to touch her, but after a glance up at the farmer stayed his hand. \u201cThis is far from done.\u201d He met her eyes, and the expression on his face chilled her. \u201cYou\u2019re diving into deep waters. Deeper than you know. You must listen to me, listen to sense. Let me keep you safe.\u201d</p><p>He was being overprotective, but she knew, only she had the power to find the information they needed. \u201cSense? I\u2019m the most sensible woman I know. You\u2019ll see. I\u2019m stronger and cleverer than you take me for. I don\u2019t need you or any man to keep me safe, when I am perfectly capable of handling matters on my own.\u201d</p><p>She hated hurting him, hated arguing, but he\u2019d forgive her the moment he saw her plan triumph. Keeping her face brave, she told him, \u201cGo, Aidan. This is my business now.\u201d</p><p>Elspeth stormed to the bottom of the hill, knowing he hadn\u2019t followed. It seemed, where Aidan was concerned, she\u2019d only just found her voice and her confidence, and it broke her heart to have to use both just to squabble. But she would have her way, because she knew, it was in her power to help both of them.</p><p>She would prove Dougal an unfit mate. And she\u2019d lead Aidan to his enemy in the bargain. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Aidan spent the night tossing on his cruelly tiny cot, the same thoughts running a deep rut in his mind. If he were a better man, he could simply claim Elspeth. He would be the one marrying her. But he had nothing, was nothing.</p><p>He thought of his enemy, and a familiar fury crackled to life in his belly. The Endeavor. It was his ship\u2014the man with the black pearl. This Captain Will was there for the taking. Aidan could feel him\u2014he just knew he was on board\u2014and lightning crackled through his bones, making him ache for a fight, eager for vengeance. He just needed to find a way. Then he would have peace.</p><p>Then he would have Elspeth.</p> <p>He\u2019d walked down to the sea before dawn, and sat there still, his mind churning, damn it all. But he couldn\u2019t stop the negative thoughts from flooding him, cracking the dam that\u2019d held his resentment at bay.</p><p>Elspeth wasn\u2019t going to fight her engagement. She thought if she insinuated herself into Fraser\u2019s circle, she might find hard evidence, might even find a way for him to get to Captain Will. But she was naive, and she was wrong.</p><p>Dread was a constant churning in his belly. His enemy was so close, his future with Elspeth within reach. And yet both eluded him. Both, so far away.</p><p>Sweet, strange, gentle Elspeth. Finally, he\u2019d found a bit of solace in this world. Finally, he felt a sense of belonging, of home, and with such a simple woman. It was humble, his desire: a modest life with her, she naught but a farmer\u2019s daughter, lovely and natural and pure, who, God spare her, had somehow found love for him in her soul.</p><p>But he feared that, yet again, what he wanted would be torn from him. He\u2019d forever be denied even the simplest of pleasures.</p> <p>\u201cLook at you, brooding like an Irishman.\u201d His twin stood over him, eclipsing the early-morning sun.</p><p>\u201cCormac.\u201d Aidan shaded his eyes to look up at him. \u201cDon\u2019t you have fish to catch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOho.\u201d Cormac studied him intently and then chuckled. \u201cI\u2019ve seen you run wild. I\u2019ve seen you play the imp. I\u2019ve seen you nettled, needled, and angry. But I daresay, I\u2019ve never seen you like this. Aidan MacAlpin, stymied by a lass.\u201d</p><p>Aidan scowled, casting an angry glance past his brother and toward the horizon.</p><p>His brother laughed outright then. \u201cAh, I see I have the right of it then. Young Miss Elspeth is the cause, I imagine?\u201d He drew in a contemplative breath at Aidan\u2019s answering silence. \u201cWell, brother, if it\u2019s a woman troubling you, I\u2019m not your man. You\u2019d best seek Gregor\u2019s advice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGregor. What does Gregor know of someone like Elspeth? She\u2019s not like the others.\u201d She was different from any woman\u2014any person\u2014he\u2019d ever known. Unsullied and genuine, and he intended to keep her that way. Which meant keeping her away from his damned rake of a brother. \u201cShe\u2019d not have patience for a man like him anyhow.\u201d</p> <p>Cormac shrugged. \u201cAll I know is that our older brother manages women as easily as a drover his cattle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cElspeth\u2019s no cow,\u201d he grumbled. He\u2019d definitely need to keep her from Gregor. On top of protecting her from Captain Will and his damned black pearl. And Fraser too, certainly.</p><p>Cormac laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re worse off than I\u2019d imagined, Aid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea.\u201d He couldn\u2019t be any worse off than he was now, his mind churning with thoughts for none but Elspeth. Her eyes. Her mouth. Her gentleness, her innocence.</p><p>She was too innocent. She\u2019d not be able to protect herself, if it came to that. Just considering all the possible threats to her well-being tightened his chest till his temper felt close to erupting. Elspeth underestimated real men, and how jealously they guarded their money and their women. He knew, because he was a real man, with the bone-deep need to guard her. \u201cHow do you keep Marj safe?\u201d he asked suddenly.</p><p>Cormac cursed under his breath. \u201cI see I need to put my nets down for this one.\u201d He tossed down his fishing gear and plopped by Aidan\u2019s side. \u201cListen, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s troubling you, or what you and that girl are caught up in ...\u201d He took a meaningful pause, then added, \u201cAnd I see you\u2019re not going to be forthcoming, are you?\u201d</p><p>Aidan gave a tight shake to his head. Vengeance would be his and his alone. The pirate with the black pearl was his to kill. Trust was growing once more between himself and his brothers, but this was something he needed to do on his own. \u201cNot yet, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you think Elspeth might be in danger?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think she\u2019s putting herself in danger because she\u2019s got the damned fool notion she\u2019s helping me.\u201d He tasted the familiar rage on his tongue. He savored it, like a fine wine, steeling himself to what might come. Because even if she were ultimately to be denied him, he\u2019d risk all he was to keep her safe. \u201cI\u2019ll kill to keep her from harm. Even if it means getting shipped back to the Indies for the crime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t let it come to that.\u201d Cormac\u2019s voice was grave, and the effect of his words on Aidan was like a bridge across a previously impassable gulf.</p><p>Something loosened in Aidan\u2019s chest, and his words followed in a rush. \u201cShe\u2019s such an innocent. She thinks she can control the situation she\u2019s in. I told her to let me handle it. But the girl is green, with too many bookish fancies dancing through her head.\u201d He remembered how Angus had appeared, neatly putting a stop to their argument. The farmer had glared down at them, making him feel like some dockside brawler. And maybe he had been a boor, gripping Elspeth\u2019s arm in anger as he had, but her stubbornness was infuriating. \u201cShe believes all will work out in the end. Like her stories.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you know better?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye. I know better.\u201d He knew better than all of them that not every story had a happy ending.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s she up to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething dangerous she read in a damned book, if I know Elspeth.\u201d She\u2019d stormed from him, and there was no way he could\u2019ve followed. No way for him to win. She would\u2019ve known what she said about choice, about his claim to her, would\u2019ve cut him. But if there was one thing he knew about her, it was that she wasn\u2019t hurtful by nature. That alone told him she was up to no good. He dared meet his brother\u2019s eyes. \u201cDamned lass won\u2019t listen to reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey never do,\u201d said Cormac.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see how can I keep her from danger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, there\u2019s something I know a little about,\u201d Cormac said ruefully. \u201cI\u2019ve but one piece of wisdom to offer. These women are willful, and they\u2019ll do as they wish, no matter what a man says.\u201d He chuckled. \u201cRee dressed like a man, no matter that I told her it was too dangerous, and damned if the lass didn\u2019t stroll down to Aberdeen harbor like she hadn\u2019t a care in the world.\u201d</p><p>Aidan laughed at the image of the elegant, upright Marjorie in men\u2019s trews. But he sobered with a sudden realization. \u201cSo what you\u2019re saying is, I can\u2019t keep her safe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, brother. I\u2019m not saying that at all.\u201d Cormac clapped him on the back. \u201cI\u2019m saying, don\u2019t let Elspeth know what it is you\u2019re about.\u201d</p><p>His twin gave him a smile, which he mirrored, every bit as heartfelt. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnytime.\u201d Cormac stood, gathering his gear. \u201cNow I\u2019d best be off, or I\u2019ll be hearing it from all the females of the household.\u201d</p><p>He watched Cormac pick his way across the rocks to the shoreline, thinking back to Elspeth\u2019s last words. She\u2019d spoken of choice, and it\u2019d been too much. He\u2019d spent a lifetime without options, and still he had none.</p><p>Well, he\u2019d claim his choice now.</p><p>He stood and strode back up the hill to Dunnottar Rock. It was up to him to right this wrong. The only sense her father would ever see was that conferred by a fivepound piece. It would be up to Aidan to expose Dougal\u2019s villainy before it was too late.</p><p>His brother was right\u2014Elspeth wouldn\u2019t listen to reason. But there was one way to make sure she didn\u2019t get into trouble. He might not have reason to return to her farm, but that didn\u2019t mean he had to stay away.</p><p>It just meant he couldn\u2019t be seen.</p><p>Chapter 24</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll need something finer than that when you\u2019re a merchant\u2019s wife.\u201d Elspeth\u2019s father eyed her threadbare dress with disapproval. \u201cYou\u2019ll want to polish the brass if you\u2019re to curry favor with the man,\u201d he added with a wink.</p><p>Elspeth clenched her teeth with annoyance. But though her mind reeled with thoughts\u2014I\u2019ll only be Aidan\u2019s wife; Fraser\u2019s a nasty old sot; I\u2019d have money for a dress if you didn\u2019t waste it all\u2014her mouth stayed shut.</p><p>He wandered closer, hovering over her. \u201cWhat are you writing? Is that how much we produced last month? We should make cheese\u2014we could turn a tidy profit.\u201d</p><p>We? She wondered at the term, but kept her mouth shut, blatantly focusing on the month\u2019s profits.</p><p>\u201cThe wee beasties are happy,\u201d her father said. \u201cThey\u2019re used to you, and seem to be fattening right up.\u201d</p><p>She sniffed. \u201cIt\u2019s only because Aidan taught me how to fix their diet.\u201d</p><p>He harrumphed. \u201cIt\u2019s a surprise how much we have, considering all he drank.\u201d</p><p>The milk. Though he hated it, Aidan had guzzled buckets of the stuff, apparently just for an excuse to come calling.</p><p>She felt as though she\u2019d swallowed a stone in her belly. Clearing her throat, she forced her voice not to quaver. \u201cWe\u2019d have far less profits, and I daresay, a lost sheep or two, had he not built us such fine fences.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFences. Pish. Hard labor is all the man is good for.\u201d</p><p>She pressed her pen too hard to the paper, and a splotch of ink bloomed thick and black on the page. She had to get out of this house. She had to enforce her own will. She would be the authoress of her own destiny.</p><p>She shot up to standing and dusted her skirts. \u201cI\u2019m off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019ve you got to go to?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She tucked the tally book back where she stored it under a loose hearthstone. She needed to get out from under her father\u2019s thumb. The man was perfectly capable of managing his own accounts, and it was time he was forced to do so.</p><p>That meant she needed to put an end to this foolish business with Fraser. \u201cI\u2019ve decided to pay a visit to my intended.\u201d She fought not to curl her lips into a sneer. \u201cIs it not time to begin currying favor?\u201d</p><p>Her father seemed to struggle with this a moment, but there was nothing he could say to stop her. \u201cJust don\u2019t ... don\u2019t muck it up. Don\u2019t say those odd things you do. If you\u2019ve naught to say, girl, don\u2019t say naught at all. And wear the blue dress\u2014that green makes you too pale.\u201d</p> <p>Though she\u2019d hoped a long, brisk walk to the city would\u2019ve had her legs spent and her anger blunted, Elspeth was as riled as ever when she arrived at Dougal\u2019s offices a couple hours later. She hadn\u2019t changed her dress.</p><p>She was through with being underestimated, and was ready to unleash her newly discovered sharp tongue on someone of the male sex. Unfortunately, her intended wasn\u2019t there to provide an outlet.</p><p>She\u2019d stormed into his offices as though she were already Lady Fraser, but was cut off at once.</p><p>\u201cYou there!\u201d a young man shouted nervously. He scurried in front of her, but she summoned her inner heroine, sizing him up with as haughty a demeanor as she could muster without feeling silly. Ink-stained fingers and last year\u2019s coat proclaimed him to be someone more than hired labor, but less than a partner.</p><p>\u201cYou are his apprentice?\u201d she asked in a voice of authority.</p> <p>He nodded, clearly not knowing what to make of a lone woman bursting onto the scene. \u201cI\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll need to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve come to see Lord Fraser.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou cannot ... I mean ... that is, he\u2019s away.\u201d</p><p>She crossed her arms at her chest. Though she wasn\u2019t clear about precisely what her plan was, she was eager to get it under way. \u201cWhat do you mean he\u2019s away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBusiness at the docks. You\u2019ll have to return later. And who might I say\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wait for him in his office.\u201d</p> <p>They engaged in a silent stare-off, until finally she raised her brows. \u201cWill you show me to his office, or would you be the one to make Dougal\u2019s fianc\u00e9e stand waiting?\u201d She dabbed at her damp forehead. \u201cAnd with me, so weary from my journey.\u201d</p><p>The man looked stricken. With a quick flurry of bows, he backed up, saying, \u201cApologies, mum. This way, if you please.\u201d He led her down the hall and into a room whose large oak desk and panel of windows told her it was indeed the office of a man in charge of things.</p><p>Her dismay at not finding Dougal disappeared. An excuse to sit unwatched in his office was an unexpected coup.</p><p>The assistant left her, and she went behind Fraser\u2019s desk. She beamed, feeling her chest swell. There were piles and piles of important-looking papers, and her fingers itched to shuffle through them. She\u2019d find her evidence in no time, and then she\u2019d be done with this ridiculous betrothal.</p><p>Hadn\u2019t she proved in her management of the farm that she didn\u2019t need a man\u2019s help? She\u2019d be the deftest of spies\u2014courageous, a warrior heroine, like Joan of Arc. Finding hard proof of Fraser\u2019s villainy would be easier than even she had imagined.</p><p>The beleaguered young man appeared again, his head popping through the doorway, and she snatched her hands to her chest.</p><p>\u201cI came to offer you a refreshment, but\u201d\u2014his eyes flicked to the papers, and when they came back to her face, they were suspicious\u2014\u201cmight I help you find something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, I was simply ...\u201d Spinning, she gestured grandly at the bank of windows. They were grimy and looked out onto an alley, but she hoped her enthusiasm was convincing. \u201cI\u2019d walked back here to enjoy Dougal\u2019s tremendous view. And, well\u201d\u2014she spun back to give a slow and loving sweep of her hands along his desk\u2014\u201cthe feel of this desk at my back, I simply had to look at it. What a powerful man is my intended.\u201d</p> <p>Throwing herself into the role, she\u2019d tried to purr that last bit, and had to suppress a satisfied smile. She\u2019d make a most excellent pirate bride.</p><p>\u201cLord Fraser\u2019s got his hands in many pots,\u201d he said, appearing to breathe more easily. \u201cIf that\u2019s all, then, I\u2019ve much work to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that will more than do it.\u201d She rested a hand on the table, knowing the exact stack of papers she\u2019d begin with first.</p><p>He left, and she dove right in, cursing that she hadn\u2019t brought her spectacles. Aidan had just gotten them for her, but already she\u2019d become accustomed to not having to squint when she read.</p><p>The first stack of documents seemed nothing more than invoices and earnings pertaining to his knitted goods business. She knew better than most how to read an account book, and she scanned the different prices for different items. It appeared Fraser dealt mostly in hosiery, but his register reflected a growing number of textiles in the form of plaids and arisaids. There were varying fabrics listed too\u2014wool, cotton, worsted crepe.</p><p>\u201cTedious,\u201d she muttered, taking in page after page of tallies. \u201cWhat a miserably ... boring ... business,\u201d she said, riffling through the bottom of the stack, clearly more of the same.</p><p>This man wasn\u2019t nearly so exciting as her swashbuckling Aidan.</p><p>She dug deeper, more certain than ever that somewhere in his office some evidence of wrongdoing was sure to be found. She got to the bottom of all his stacks, though, had opened and sifted through drawers, but there was nothing villainous in sight.</p><p>Putting her hands on her hips, she turned in a circle, taking in the room. \u201cWhere are you?\u201d</p><p>She plopped into his desk chair, idly opening and closing each drawer once more for good measure. As she closed the last drawer, her eyes lit on a strange seam along the bottom.</p><p>\u201cAnd what are you?\u201d She dug her fingers along the edge. Fitting her thumb inside the seam, she pried up a small panel. She pulled out a small leather-bound folio and chuckled. \u201cDougal Fraser, you sneaky old cadger.\u201d</p><p>She opened it and flipped through, and though she didn\u2019t understand exactly what she was looking at, she could tell that it was something out of the ordinary. And one name recurred over and over.</p><p>\u201cVirginia Company,\u201d she whispered. She scanned pages of names written on what looked like a passenger manifest. What was an exporter of knit goods doing transporting passengers?</p><p>She flipped through some more pages, and the blood froze in her veins. The Endeavor\u2014the ship on which young Aidan had been held prisoner. She read on. It appeared as though Fraser had commissioned cargo for the Endeavor. Were these the same sort of \u201cpassengers\u201d as Aidan had been? She shivered.</p><p>If she could just tear out the page, it might be enough to prove that her fianc\u00e9 was involved in shady dealings. Or enough for her father to postpone the betrothal, at least. She needed to rip it from the seam, and in such a way that Fraser wouldn\u2019t notice. She cracked the folio all the way open and ran a finger along the binding.</p><p>\u201cFind what you\u2019re looking for?\u201d</p><p>Her heart exploded in her chest. Dougal Fraser stood in the doorway.</p><p>Though he was an older gentleman with thinning, graying hair, he wasn\u2019t precisely old. Nor, with a set of well-balanced features and an aquiline nose, was he unattractive. But hovering there, his already pinched eyes narrowed tightly in anger, he struck Elspeth as a very ugly sort indeed. \u201cMaking yourself at home, I see.\u201d</p><p>She was caught elbow-deep in his papers. The only strategy available to her was to lie, and blatantly. \u201cI longed for another visit with you,\u201d she said, pasting an amiable smile on her face. \u201cI am to be your bride, after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed. And a lucky man I am.\u201d As he strolled toward her, his eyes danced over his belongings as though scanning for anything else that might be amiss. \u201cAnd how lucky too, that I finished early at the docks. To think I might\u2019ve missed a visit with my intended.\u201d</p><p>He loomed over where she sat in his chair. \u201cWhen my apprentice told me you awaited me in my offices, well, you can imagine I came back here in an instant. To see your lovely face once more, of course.\u201d He stroked the backs of his fingers along her cheek, and she tried to conceal her shudder. \u201cEven lovelier than I remembered.\u201d</p><p>His hand stilled, and he took and cupped her jaw more firmly than was comfortable. \u201cBut tell me, is it that you plan to get to know me by reading my private papers?\u201d</p><p>More than he knew. Face stiff from her fake smile, she said, \u201cI thought it\u2019d be a good idea to get a better notion of what sort of business yours is. It seems grand indeed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do have an ... unnatural interest in business.\u201d Abruptly, he let go her face and his eyes flicked to his open drawer. \u201cI see I\u2019ve found myself a thorough bride. You must tell me if you have any questions.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at the book trembling in her hands. It was still opened to the passenger list. \u201cThat, for instance. What do you make of it?\u201d</p><p>She closed it, placing it primly in her lap. \u201cIt ... I ... I can\u2019t say I know what it is.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a patronizing smile. \u201cSurely a clever businesswoman like you has some theory. Tell me,\u201d he said more firmly. \u201cWhat does it look like?\u201d</p><p>She was uncertain how to answer. He had a sharp mind, and she could tell he thought hers sharp too. A bald-faced lie would be foolish, so she chose to massage the truth. \u201cIt looked as though you\u2019re transporting passengers, not knitted goods.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid it?\u201d The sound of his falsetto laughter filled the room. \u201cHow odd!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d She matched her false laugh to his, her teeth gritted with forced cheer. \u201cIndeed! Imagine that.\u201d</p><p>Fraser\u2019s mood took a sudden turn. He strode to the door, shutting it hard. Shutting them in together.</p><p>Her heart thudded in her chest, but she made herself be brave. She\u2019d told Aidan she could handle this herself, and blast it, she would. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He stalked back and sat on the edge of his desk so that she was forced to crane her neck up to look at him. He took his book from her lap, letting his hand graze lustfully along her thigh as he did so. \u201cI don\u2019t think I like you snooping about. You must ask me next time. I\u2019d be happy to show you whatever you\u2019d like to see.\u201d</p><p>Nestling the folio back in its hiding spot, he added, \u201cIn fact, I should take you on a tour of the docks.\u201d</p><p>The prospect gave her a chill. \u201cThat sounds ... delightful.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut sadly, it\u2019s time for me to get back to work. I must make money to buy us a honeymoon you\u2019ll never forget.\u201d Giving her an oily smile, he stood, taking her hands and pulling her up with him. \u201cBut first, a kiss for your husband-to-be.\u201d</p><p>Her facade cracked, and she instinctively recoiled.</p><p>Fraser\u2019s grip tightened on her fingers. Eyes narrowed, he said, \u201cElspeth, dear heart. You don\u2019t strike me as the most eager of brides. Is it that you\u2019re afraid of me?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo, of course not. I simply ...\u201d</p><p>Simply what? I\u2019m simply repulsed?</p> <p>His eyes seemed to pierce her. \u201cYou are simply ... overwhelmed, perhaps, at how quickly we are proceeding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, relieved at being given an out. \u201cPerhaps that is it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you don\u2019t want to carry this engagement forward just yet,\u201d he suggested gently.</p><p>She hesitated. Could it be that Fraser wanted out of the betrothal too? Had it all just been something her father had concocted?</p><p>She felt a glimmer of hope. This arrangement might be easier to back out of than she\u2019d thought. \u201cPerhaps you are right, Lord Fraser.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d he said, taking his hands from hers. He added in a clipped voice, \u201cI had the right of it.\u201d</p> <p>She told herself that his peculiar tone wasn\u2019t chilly, that Fraser was merely acting formally. She gave him a broad smile. \u201cI\u2019m grateful for your understanding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I understand. I understand quite well. You don\u2019t think you need to make this marriage.\u201d</p><p>It sounded like an accusation, and the shift in tone confused her. She shrugged nervously. \u201cI suppose I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I tell you that you do,\u201d he said sharply.</p><p>Her confusion turned to panic. He\u2019d tricked her into confessing her aversion to their marriage. \u201cBut I thought you didn\u2019t want it either ... ?\u201d</p><p>But instead of responding, he only stared coldly, and so she prattled on. \u201cI\u2019m happy, you see. Our farm is thriving. And I\u2019m very busy\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFool girl. You have no idea how deeply in debt your father has fallen.\u201d</p><p>She bristled. There was nothing that nettled her more than being called foolish. She was smart and clever, yet it seemed the men of the world were blind to it. \u201cOn the contrary. I know my father\u2019s debts well. And they are not so great as to force me into wedlock.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cForced, are you?\u201d There was a sneer in his narrow eyes.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t so impetuous as to take the bait, and took their argument in a different direction. \u201cWe\u2019ve made improvements recently, and have begun to turn a profit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA grand success, is it? Your precious wee farm?\u201d His voice and expression were flat, and she didn\u2019t know how to read him.</p><p>\u201cI believe it will be a success,\u201d she replied, sounding more confident than she felt.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d thought you might want a man like me to help. But perhaps not.\u201d He stood stiffly at the door, holding it open for her. He\u2019d been difficult to read, but this hint couldn\u2019t have been more blatant.</p><p>She scurried out. \u201cGood day, then.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a curt nod. \u201cGood luck to you, Miss Farquharson. And to your farm.\u201d</p><p>Fraser shut the door on Elspeth\u2019s back. Whatever he\u2019d expected her reaction to their betrothal to be, it hadn\u2019t been that.</p><p>She was a queer little creature, but curious and clever in a way that made him feel awake and alive. It was an unexpected pleasure to encounter such a mind, and in a woman, of all creatures.</p><p>He went back to his chair, retrieved his folio, and idly flipped through its pages. What had she been looking for? Had she found it?</p><p>Scooting back, he kicked his feet up on his desk. The chit was sneaky and willful. Not unlike himself, he thought with amusement. Though he\u2019d yet to figure out what her game was, he found himself enjoying it very much indeed.</p><p>Leaning back, he rested his hands atop his head and smiled. He was enjoying this little game, but not as much as he was going to enjoy watching that pretty porcelain face submit to his will. Never before had he considered taking a wife, but he decided he\u2019d quite like having this one. And he would have her.</p><p>Because, contrary to her thoughts on the matter, Elspeth would find herself needing him. And he knew exactly what manner of help he could provide.</p><p>Chapter 25</p><p>Aidan caught up with Elspeth just as she was dashing from Fraser\u2019s offices. He ducked into a shadowy doorway, hiding just in time. Damned if the woman wasn\u2019t exactly where he feared she\u2019d be.</p><p>Had she met with Fraser? And might she actually have discovered something? She was the brightest person he knew\u2014man or woman\u2014and nothing she did would surprise him.</p><p>She stormed down the alley, turning onto a larger street, and Aidan sprang out, quick to catch up before she got away. She was headed toward the water, without a pause in her step, or even a cowl to conceal her face. Rather, there was purpose in her stride, rushing to the docks as though she were a captain with a ship on fire.</p><p>What was the woman up to? She had such fanciful notions, come from reading too many books. She was clearly on some sort of mission, which meant she was bound for some sort of trouble.</p><p>Had she no fear? She was utterly dauntless. It was maddening. And, he had to admit, he couldn\u2019t help but admire her for it.</p><p>They reached the harbor, and as she slowed her pace, he let more space grow between them. Shadowing her was proving fascinating, and he wasn\u2019t yet ready to be discovered.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until she stopped that he fully realized where they were. He ducked behind a pillar, leaning against it, his heart in his throat, when he saw what it was she was staring at.</p><p>The Endeavor.</p><p>He looked from the ship back to Elspeth, and found he couldn\u2019t tear his eyes from her. He knew how to read people\u2014it was what\u2019d helped him survive captivity\u2014and he knew that she was thinking of him.</p><p>And what she felt was sympathy. It was in the tightness of her shoulders, and the way she didn\u2019t seem to breathe. In the tears she suppressed behind pinched lips. But rather than anger him, for once in his life, he found he welcomed the compassion. Rather than making him feel pitied or pathetic, Elspeth\u2019s consideration warmed him.</p><p>He stepped closer in order to read her more deeply, sensing there was another emotion she held in check. In the way she held a hand to her heart, in the sadness in her eyes, he read something more powerful, more abiding.</p><p>He was humbled. Unmanned. Because he realized it was love that he read on her face.</p><p>Elspeth was aggravatingly fearless. But she was also clever and kind. Gentle, loving, and tender. And his chest swelled, knowing he couldn\u2019t help but love her too.</p><p>She spun on her heel and walked on, and he was startled into movement, jogging to catch up. He found that he was smiling. His Elspeth was so many things, but mostly she was utterly, shockingly unpredictable.</p><p>She marched down the docks, pausing at the head of each quay to peer at the names of all the ships. Noticing that she lingered at the smaller boats, he chuckled, knowledge of her destination dawning on him.</p><p>Finally, she came to his boat, and only then did her step become hesitant. He shook his head, marveling at this sweetly shy woman. She appeared to check and double-check the name, Journeyman, painted in crimson on the burnished brown timber.</p><p>Was she coming to tell him something she\u2019d learned at Fraser\u2019s? Had she found evidence, or did she have other news for him?</p><p>Or was she simply coming for him?</p><p>She stood, her hand poised on the rope ladder that dangled down the side of the sloop, and glanced around to see if any would stop her. He\u2019d let go his three crewmen to save some coin, but he\u2019d hired a pair of dock rats to guard the boat. He spotted them, and catching their attention, he silently shooed them away. Nobody would interrupt her.</p><p>He bit his cheek not to laugh at the sight of her grabbing both hands to that ladder and stepping on, easy as you please. He waited for her to make her way up and over, giving her an extra few moments for good measure, then followed.</p><p>For a while, he stood on the top rungs, peering over, simply watching her. She walked the deck as though in a trance, running her fingers along its varnished surfaces, tracing fingertips along polished bronze cleats and rings.</p><p>The sloop had been in fine shape when he\u2019d taken it over, and he took pride that it was in even better shape now. He kept it polished and fine, and the sight of her touching it with such loving appreciation kindled a fierce pleasure to life in his chest.</p><p>If he ever took Elspeth for a sail, he\u2019d let her steer.</p><p>She wrapped her hands around the wheel, and her lips parted in a sort of thrall. Another, fiercer heat crackled to life in his veins. Elspeth was such a sensual creature. He wanted to experience her caresses along his body. To see her eyes go hazy at the feel of him under her fingertips.</p><p>A madness overtook him, the only thought in his mind that he must go to her. He made the final climb up and over, landing stealthily on deck.</p><p>But she disappeared from sight, reappearing at the head of the companionway steps, where she stood contemplating the deck below. She emanated such grave dignity one would\u2019ve thought it the gallows and she Mary, Queen of Scots.</p><p>A feeling of such great affection swamped him, he stopped still in his tracks. She was as intrepid a woman as those found in any book. Sweeter and more innocent than any he\u2019d ever known. His lust altered, and the raging torrent that\u2019d swept him deepened to a bottomless, hot spring. Him, immersed but not adrift.</p><p>She ventured below, and then her head popped up again, looking much like an adorable wee gopher. He burst into a grin, wanting to sneak after her and surprise her. To chase her up and down those steps until he teased from her the laughter he so loved, the sound of Elspeth, joyous and free. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He wanted to catch her, and kiss her senseless.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t surprised when she ducked back below. His quarters were down there, and he was certain his pretty little spy would find much in the place to entertain her.</p><p>Grinning, he pulled in the dock lines, hauled anchor, and got the Journeyman under way. As he steered out of Aberdeen harbor, Aidan\u2019s smile turned wicked. He\u2019d show his Elspeth what happened to stowaways.</p> <p>Elspeth looked around at what she deduced was Aidan\u2019s cabin. It was tiny, but tidy, with a narrow bunk, lantern, and nautical instruments and maps stowed in neat compartments on a small table.</p><p>She pulled out one of the maps, fascinated by this glimpse of a sailor\u2019s life. Smoothing it carefully on the table, she thought of her heroic pirate rogue. When he\u2019d sailed from the Indies to Scotland, he hadn\u2019t been able to read, and yet he\u2019d navigated his way, in spite of it all. He might not have been able to decipher letters on a page, but he knew how to read the stars in the sky.</p><p>Her breath caught, feeling a pang in her heart. Aidan was all alone in the world, and yet, standing in his orderly captain\u2019s cabin, she saw how he\u2019d carved a place for himself. He\u2019d endured such pain, rising like a phoenix from the nightmarish ashes of his childhood.</p><p>She sat on the hard bunk, and the echoes of him, all around her, were a comfort.</p><p>The events at Fraser\u2019s office had confused her. Despite her understanding that they\u2019d agreed to end their engagement, at the conclusion of their meeting, the old merchant had gotten a strange, suspicious look in those slitted eyes. But a veil had quickly dropped over them, concealing whatever machinations he might\u2019ve been entertaining. Wondering what thoughts he hid, she\u2019d left his offices feeling deeply unsettled.</p> <p>Their ridiculous betrothal would be broken\u2014she\u2019d will it thus, if need be. She\u2019d be Aidan\u2019s wife, or nobody\u2019s.</p><p>Using thoughts of Aidan to summon strength, she\u2019d gone to the docks, soon finding herself searching for the ship in which he\u2019d been stolen away so long ago. The sight of it had seared her, her heart breaking all over again for the boy he\u2019d been.</p><p>She\u2019d always battled self-pity for her own situation\u2014a lone daughter set up as the de facto head of an impoverished household\u2014but her childhood had been the lap of luxury compared to the horrors he\u2019d experienced.</p><p>There was a clattering and the boat heaved, and she gripped the edge of the bunk to steady herself, panic seizing her chest. Were they leaving the dock? Was she to find herself indentured to some distant tropical isle?</p><p>Forcing her breath to steady, she made her way back up the ladder, her skirts an awkward tangle around her legs. With a calming inhale, she peeked onto the deck.</p><p>Aidan. Her pulse leaped at the sight of him, jauntily perched on a rail, one hand resting on the helm. His easy smile met her.</p> <p>\u201cAfternoon, luvvie. You\u2019ve always said you wanted a sail.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 26</p><p>\u201cA sail? Truly, Aidan, you\u2019re taking me for a sail?\u201d Elspeth spun in a circle on deck, taking it all in. A gray-and-white plume of water trailed them as Aberdeen harbor receded into the distance. It was breathtaking. A sharp gust snapped life into the sails, and she studied them, regretful concern stabbing her. \u201cBut don\u2019t you need men to help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA sloop this small, one man can handle her.\u201d He stood and, tying a rope over the wheel to steady it, stalked toward her. The look in his eyes sent a shiver across her skin. \u201cBut you.\u201d He swept his knuckles along her cheek. \u201cHow readily I can handle you is another matter entirely.\u201d</p><p>Her wind-chilled cheeks turned hot. She, an unmanageable sort of woman? Never had she been paid a higher compliment. \u201cAre you saying I require management?\u201d She was proud of the coy lilt she heard in her own voice.</p><p>He seemed to give her question honest consideration. \u201cI think that is precisely what I\u2019m saying.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, but was interrupted by a loud racket as the largest of the three sails began to snap and clang in the wind.</p><p>He ran to it, hauling on the winch to tighten the sheet. His shirt strained over his broad back and arms as he spun the handle as easily as she might stir a pot.</p> <p>\u201cShe needed a bit of luffing,\u201d he said, cuffing his sleeves as he strode back to her. His hair was a windwhipped tangle, and he raked it from his face.</p><p>Her breath caught. Aidan truly was a rogue, a man alone in the world. Like a hero on a quest, he could go anywhere, be anyone. And with him, she\u2019d finally become the pirate bride she\u2019d always dreamed of being.</p><p>\u201cNow where were we?\u201d he asked, studying her.</p><p>The smile in his eyes emboldened her, and feeling mischievous, she pointed up the mast to the crow\u2019s nest. \u201cI think you were readying to take me up there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas I?\u201d He looked up, shielding his eyes from the glare. \u201cThat was a fool thing of me to consider.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d She raised her brows. If she were to live out one dream, she might as well realize every last one. And she\u2019d always dreamed of climbing the rigging, soaring over the waves like a bird in flight. \u201cWill you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill I take you up to the lookout?\u201d Widened eyes spoke to his amused disbelief.</p><p>She nodded gravely. She\u2019d show him she was not an object of amusement.</p><p>His eyes grazed up the thin rope ladder to the rickety perch situated high in the air. \u201cIt\u2019s just a barrel, Beth. Lashed to the mast with a bit of line.\u201d</p><p>But she was determined to climb as high as any pirate. Sensing that pride might be Aidan\u2019s weakness, she asked, \u201cAre you saying your ship isn\u2019t secure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I\u2019m not,\u201d he said, his eyes narrowed.</p><p>\u201cThen why not take me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it won\u2019t fit the two of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it\u2019s a good thing you don\u2019t seem to want to go up there.\u201d She smiled, proud of her logic.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not letting you climb that alone,\u201d he said quickly, disbelief in his voice.</p><p>\u201cGood, then we\u2019ll climb it together.\u201d She hiked her skirts. \u201cShall we?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head at her. Gritting his teeth, finally he said, \u201cIf you must.\u201d</p><p>She beamed. \u201cI must.\u201d</p><p>Instinctively, she knew not to look down and kept her eyes trained on the rungs as she climbed. Before she knew it, she was clambering into the barrel, Aidan holding on to the ladder with one hand and guiding her over with the other.</p><p>It truly was just a barrel sawed in half, with alternate slats removed, and she arranged herself as best she could, slipping her legs through the narrow gaps.</p><p>She realized Aidan was laughing. \u201cWhat?\u201d she demanded, summoning as much dignity as one could with one\u2019s skirts bunched about one\u2019s knees. But he only shook his head, so she pressed: \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only that you flew up the rigging like a ... like</p><p>a ...\u201d \u201cA what?\u201d \u201cWell, like no overeager cabin boy I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d \u201cAre you saying you think of me as a boy?\u201d She\u2019d spo</p><p>ken playfully. But then she caught his eyes devouring her bare legs, and she blushed.</p><p>\u201cCertainly not,\u201d he said in a husky voice. Clearing his throat, he tore his gaze from her pale skin. His eyes were hooded when they met hers.</p><p>He looked so dangerous, clinging to the rigging with that look in his eyes. Shyness struck her, paralyzing her tongue in her mouth.</p><p>His expression softened. \u201cDon\u2019t be shy on my account,\u201d he told her quietly, sensing her discomfort. And of course he sensed it. Aidan seemed always to understand. Even when she\u2019d not been able to string two words together without stuttering, he\u2019d looked past her self-consciousness to see her true self.</p><p>He unleashed his most rakish smile. \u201cYou have lovely knees\u2014it\u2019s only right that you bare them to Neptune himself. And besides, they say a naked woman on board ship brings good luck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAidan!\u201d she shrieked, shocked and delighted in equal parts.</p><p>\u201cI speak truly.\u201d With an innocence she knew was feigned, he added gravely, \u201cThat is why so many ships bear a carved lady as a figurehead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it indeed?\u201d She didn\u2019t know how they\u2019d found themselves discussing such a thing as naked ladies carved upon ships\u2019 bows. It made her skin feel taut and uncomfortable, as though it were stretched too tight over her bones.</p><p>A sharp gust tore her hair loose, and the wind lashed every which way over her bared calves. She couldn\u2019t help but inhale deeply, taking a great gulp of that fresh air. It smelled extraordinary, so brisk and clean, she had to wonder if she were perhaps the first ever even to breathe it. It was so unlike the air of Aberdeen\u2014the oily, fishy rot of its harbor, or the scent of mildew and dung that clung to their small cottage.</p><p>Clutching her wind-whipped hair to the side of her head, she eagerly devoured the vast gray swath of nothingness yawning before her. The open sea. So much water all around, it was incomprehensible.</p><p>For a moment, seated upon her glorious perch, she felt as if time had been suspended. Somewhere people were being born, living their lives, and dying, all in the space of her musings.</p><p>The wind gusted again, and she trembled.</p><p>\u201cAre you afraid?\u201d Aidan\u2019s low, masculine voice cut through the keening sea air.</p><p>She looked down at him and shivered again, for an entirely different reason. He clung to the rope ladder, trying his best not to glance at her naked knees, his roguish eyes wrinkling in a smile meant only for her.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cNot afraid.\u201d</p><p>Shaking his head, he grinned. \u201cNo, of course you\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMerely cold.\u201d She gave him a rueful smile.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll simply have to amend that.\u201d He gripped a broad hand around her knee, tucking warm fingers in the crook of it.</p><p>Her breath caught, his hand on her naked skin throwing her back in time, making her as heart-wrenchingly tongue-tied as she\u2019d ever been when they first met.</p><p>The boat hit a wave and lurched, and Aidan swayed into her, his hand sliding higher up her skirts. The warmth of his touch turned into a scorching heat, searing up between her legs and inflaming her belly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She gasped. Uncertain what to say or do, she filled the air with mindless chatter. \u201cIt\u2019s so wide open out here.\u201d</p><p>He tore his eyes from her to gaze off into the distance. \u201cAye, so it is. Open and clean and sure. So much bigger than any plantation, or slave owner, or any of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd perilous too.\u201d She followed his gaze, straining to make sense of the horizon. She imagined the hazy line where the earth itself curved out of sight. \u201cThere\u2019s so much water\u2014it\u2019s overwhelming. Almost a little frightening. Do you ever worry about shipwrecks, or drowning?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cElspeth, afraid of something? I never thought I\u2019d see the day.\u201d He smiled and gave her leg a squeeze, and then, with a shrug, looked back to the horizon. \u201cIt\u2019s not the sea that scares me. The sea will kill a man, but that\u2019s who she is. She casts no judgment, sees no difference between a man with money and one with none. Even the storms have a kind of resolve\u2014as though only nature herself knows what she\u2019s truly about. You speak of all this water, but I didn\u2019t know peace until I was on the water, headed back to Scotland.\u201d</p><p>She inhaled deeply, thinking how shocking it must\u2019ve been, the sea so clean and wide open compared with the oppressive life of an indentured slave. \u201cIt must\u2019ve been so different for you, after you escaped. Did you not simply want to stay on the water, sailing forever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had to sail back to find you.\u201d He\u2019d said it playfully, but the words hung in the air, charged.</p><p>She knew in that moment how deeply she loved him.</p><p>She\u2019d sensed it before, but this was a revelation that sheared her through, a bone-deep knowledge striking her like a thunderclap. Not only did she love Aidan, she could have no other man but him. She\u2019d be incomplete without him. Unrealized without him.</p> <p>His hand on her leg burned. She wanted it to move higher, wanted him to move closer. Her body ached with the wanting.</p><p>She wanted him to kiss her again, and more than kiss her, she wanted him to take her. She sensed she\u2019d never fully be a woman until he did. She\u2019d be trapped in some eternal limbo between girl and woman until she felt his body over her, in her.</p><p>She\u2019d thought him handsome and strong. Dangerous for all but her. But Aidan was so much more than that. He was the other, unrealized part of herself.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She knew he meant to ask only if she were ready to descend. But when she spoke, she answered quite a different question. \u201cYes, Aidan,\u201d she said steadily. \u201cI\u2019m ready.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 27</p> <p>When they\u2019d first met, Aidan thought Elspeth a skittish sort of girl, sheltered and easily frightened. How wrong he\u2019d been. She was simply shy, and he was quickly finding out how large was the gulf that lay between fearful and bashful.</p><p>\u201cBefore we climb down, you must kiss me,\u201d she said, as brazen as any wanton. She leaned down, tangling her fingers in his hair. They were cool, her touch gentle, but rather than soothe him, she inflamed him.</p><p>No, she didn\u2019t have a scared bone in her body.</p><p>He was shocked, and he was grateful. Grateful to be in this woman\u2019s life, grateful she found him worthy. And grateful too for all the damned books that\u2019d put the thought into this innocent maiden\u2019s head that she might climb a ship\u2019s rigging and kiss its captain, despite his being in possession of a soul cursed by the devil.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll kiss you,\u201d he said, his words sounding rougher than he\u2019d intended, and he took control, pulling her down to him, seizing her in a kiss he\u2019d been saving for years. His lips met hers, and he gave her the kiss he\u2019d dreamed of, a kiss worthy of taming such a fanciful woman. Their tongues twined, and he gave her a kiss to show the world that he would take what he wanted, that he\u2019d possess as any other man possessed.</p><p>But rather than tame her, his rough taking of her mouth had only inflamed Elspeth, and she writhed at his touch, pulling away to gasp for air only to come back down to him, her hands tangling in his shirt, her legs wrapping about his body.</p><p>The ship hit a wave and jounced. His hand slipped farther up her thigh, and he realized how close his fingers were to the thatch of hair between her legs that he so longed to touch.</p><p>The muscles of his legs, normally so strong, flinched with the effort of balancing so precariously high in the rigging. As much as he wanted to find a way to take Elspeth then and there, he summoned his resolve. \u201cWe mustn\u2019t do this. We need to go back down on deck.\u201d</p> <p>She pulled from him, and she was a glorious sight, her cheeks red from the wind, her eyes bright with lust. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Joy crackled through his chest at the feel of her in his hands. She had no idea the danger he posed to her innocence. \u201cYou want that I should steal your maidenhead, here in the crow\u2019s nest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said seriously. \u201cWe can go back to your cabin and you can take it there.\u201d</p><p>A loud laugh burst from him. \u201cCome, Beth. We\u2019ll discuss this on deck, where I\u2019m not in danger of being unmanned whilst balancing sixty feet in the air.\u201d</p><p>They made their way back down the ladder, and the sight of her rump cradled between his arms, nestled just in front of his face, did nothing for his hardened cock, now standing at merry attention as though it were a bizarre extension of the rigging.</p><p>Reaching the bottom, she leaped into his arms, and he stumbled back a step as he caught her. She was a spitfire in his arms, with unschooled but eager kisses. If she didn\u2019t watch herself, he\u2019d take her virginity there on the varnished cedar of his ship\u2019s deck.</p><p>He kissed her, but fought to keep his head. Elspeth deserved much in this world, and though he could dream of a hundred different things he\u2019d do to her body, taking her virginity before she wed was not one of them.</p><p>She pulled away, those beautiful lips parted and gently panting. \u201cAidan? Is aught the matter? Do you not want me?\u201d</p><p>Reminding himself of his resolve, he set her apart to stand before him on the deck. \u201cHow could you doubt it?\u201d</p><p>She had no idea of the battle that waged inside him. But he\u2019d not take Elspeth\u2019s virginity like an unruly ship\u2019s hand.</p><p>She smoothed her skirts, explaining in a tone a politician might use to present a bill before Parliament, \u201cI don\u2019t see the trouble. I want you. Very much. Right now, in fact. There\u2019s no better opportunity. And you know what folk say: \u2018Fools look to tomorrow, wise men use tonight.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cI don\u2019t think that was their intent.\u201d Some might call Elspeth quirky or strange, but he\u2019d never tire of the unexpected delight that found purchase in his heart whenever she was near. \u201cI can\u2019t take your innocence, not like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if you despoil me, then I\u2019ll get to marry you, not Fraser.\u201d</p><p>His jaw dropped\u2014she was too much. She was lovely and artless, and he wanted her more than he\u2019d ever wanted anything in his life. Very much. Right now, in fact. \u201cBelieve me, as much as I\u2019d enjoy a thorough despoiling, we\u2019ve the not-so-minor matter of Fraser to sort out, remember? I\u2019ll remind you, you\u2019re betrothed to the man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for long,\u201d she announced, striding across the deck in the direction of the companionway steps. Hiking her skirts, she began to descend belowdecks.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo your cabin, of course.\u201d</p><p>Her words finally hit him. \u201cWait, Beth. What do you mean \u2018not for long\u2019?\u201d</p><p>She froze, looking over her shoulder at him. She was halfway down the stairs already, visible only from her chest up. He\u2019d yet to understand how it was that a landloving maiden in full skirts could be so damned fast at moving hither and yon aboard a moving ship.</p><p>He caught up to her, looking down from the head of the stairs. \u201cWhat happened in Fraser\u2019s offices?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe talked.\u201d</p><p>He heaved a sigh. \u201cThough I greatly appreciate that there are other pressing goals at the moment\u201d\u2014he shifted the seat of his trews in proof of his point\u2014\u201cI must know, what did you talk about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith Fraser?\u201d</p><p>He only narrowed his eyes in answer. She was clearly not going to make this easy.</p><p>\u201cOh, fine.\u201d She squared her shoulders. \u201cI told him I felt forced.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told Fraser you felt forced into marrying him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like that, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBloody hell, woman. How do you think someone like Fraser would react to that? Those are fighting words to such a man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were neither intended as fighting words, nor do I think they were received thusly.\u201d She stood below him on the stairs, but even from that vantage point, he noted her chin lift defensively. \u201cI simply explained how the farm has begun to succeed, and so I no longer require a husband.\u201d</p><p>She no longer required a husband. Did that apply to him as well? Brooding, he stared down at her. It appeared his Elspeth had found her voice and her confidence.</p><p>He forced it from his mind, focusing instead on the issue at hand. \u201cI don\u2019t see how that offers a way out of the betrothal.\u201d His words came out harshly, the thought of any man laying claim to Elspeth too infuriating to bear.</p><p>\u201cIt does, if it means my father no longer needs financial assistance.\u201d She walked up a step, standing closer on the stairs. \u201cPlease, Aidan, can we put this aside for now? Fraser isn\u2019t here.\u201d She reached one of her delicate hands up, hesitantly touching his leg. \u201cBut I am.\u201d</p><p>No words escaped his clenched jaw. Fraser might not be there, but the specter of him was, a barrier between them.</p><p>She climbed up another step, stroking him now. The fabric of his trews was thick, but he felt her touch as keenly as if it\u2019d been on his bare skin. \u201cPlease just kiss me. Kiss me like you were kissing me up there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand,\u201d he said through gritted teeth. Wealthy men inhabited a far different world from the one she was used to. Wealthy men could simply choose people, and have them. He\u2019d experienced the phenomenon firsthand, for the past thirteen years.

What he needed was to grab her questing hands, haul her over his shoulder, and take her and rob her maidenhead on his damned bunk.</p><p>She tilted her head, studying him. Was it lust she saw on his face? Did she see his agony too? His dark despair?</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m offering myself to you,\u201d she said with a tender innocence that shattered his blackened heart. \u201cI\u2019ll have you as my husband. And if we consummate our union here, now, nobody can come between us.\u201d</p><p>Her na\u00efvet\u00e9 gutted him. \u201cI know a whole world that could come between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you want to consummate our union?\u201d Her gaze flicked to his breeches. The question in her eyes was so trusting, curse him but he got harder for it. He saw she\u2019d noticed by the rising blush on her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cWant to?\u201d Emotion made his voice ragged. Always there\u2019d been something to come between him and his heart\u2019s desire. Never would he get what he wanted, what he needed. Never would he know satisfaction. \u201cChrist, woman, of course I want to.\u201d</p><p>Her hand on his leg stilled. \u201cIs it that you don\u2019t want me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course I want you.\u201d As if that was all this was about. He wanted her spread naked and writhing on his cot, laid bare for the taking. And the pain of it was, he knew she\u2019d let him. He wanted her in a new wedding dress, with pretty laces and ribbons, and eyes only for him. He wanted her, and wanted the world to recognize her place by his side as right and true. \u201cBut I want all of you. And some rich pig has decided he\u2019d have you instead, and I know better than to hope for anything of the sort.\u201d</p><p>Her hands burst into movement again, roving recklessly along his legs. \u201cBut I said\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat you said tells me you don\u2019t understand.\u201d He had to get away from her touch. He couldn\u2019t have her, and the fury of it was beyond bearing.</p><p>Fearing his lust might turn cruel, he stormed down, shouldering past her on the steps. \u201cI can\u2019t have you as my own. I can\u2019t even lie with you. You\u2019re to marry Fraser, and it\u2019s a virgin he\u2019s paid for.\u201d</p><p>He heard her sharp intake of breath, but remained staring out the tiny porthole, refusing to look at her. He\u2019d been deceiving himself. He\u2019d lost Elspeth the day Fraser first set eyes on her, and it was only a matter of time before he lost her for good. He didn\u2019t know how he was to survive it.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t bear this pain, but he could make her burden easier to shoulder. \u201cYou could accept the man,\u201d he said, cursing the defeat in his voice. \u201cYou\u2019d be wealthy, Beth. He\u2019s older\u2014he might leave you a young widow. You\u2019d have money and books, and everything you\u2019ve ever wanted.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you think I want to marry him?\u201d Snapping, she stormed to him, pummeling hard on his back. \u201cYou\u2019re everything I ever wanted. You stupid, stupid man. I don\u2019t want wealth. Never have I wanted wealth. I don\u2019t want to marry Fraser. I want to be with you.\u201d</p><p>He spun to face her. \u201cWhat you want. You think a person always gets what they want? No, I\u2019ll not take what doesn\u2019t belong to me. And clearly your father thinks you belong to another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut don\u2019t you see? I won\u2019t go to Fraser.\u201d She planted hands on hips. \u201cI cannot. I will not. So we needn\u2019t wait because I won\u2019t marry anyone. But you. Ever.\u201d</p><p>It took her shouts, but finally he heard her. Finally he believed her. She wanted him. And not just for one stolen afternoon on a ship. She\u2019d fight to be with him for a lifetime. The prospect amazed and humbled him.</p><p>He took her in his arms, but she continued to rave, an overwrought bundle in his embrace. His gentle Beth was hollering up at him, and he marveled at the sound of it, and at the miracle that he\u2019d been the one to rouse her.</p><p>She clawed her fingers into his shirt. \u201cWhat do I want with riches? Never would I want that. You\u2019re all I want.\u201d</p><p>Her passion matched his own, and it seared the last doubts from his mind. Dared he hope for what he wanted? Could it be that together they\u2019d find a way?</p><p>She went limp against him, whispering, \u201cBut it seems you don\u2019t want me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong,\u201d he said, his voice taut with focus. \u201cI want you, Beth. And I\u2019ll have you.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 28</p><p>Elspeth went from despair to delight in one dizzying moment. She\u2019d thought Aidan didn\u2019t want her. She\u2019d been wrong.</p><p>He scooped her up, and she let loose a delighted yelp. She wrapped her arms around his neck, holding on as he made his way along the narrow corridor to his cabin. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she asked, even though she had some idea.</p><p>Without putting her down, he stood before his bunk, nuzzling at her neck and throat. \u201cI think you proposed.\u201d</p><p>His kisses were wet and his breath was hot, and a pure, animal lust barreled through her, surging from deep in her womb, shimmering along the surface of her skin in delicious waves, until her breasts pulled taut and a pulse throbbed through her, sounding her want. \u201cProposed?\u201d she managed, her voice weak. \u201cYes, I think you\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>He threw her onto the bed, and the savage possession in his gaze turned her desire sharp. He shucked off his breeches, not tearing his hooded eyes from hers. \u201cAnd you said something about consummation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d She trembled, breathless to see what he\u2019d do, how he\u2019d look. She\u2019d imagined how Aidan\u2019s strong body might appear without clothes, but until this moment, her imaginings had been only vague. But now, even though his shirt fell almost to his knees, she spied something ominous straining from the shadows between his legs.</p><p>She was about to see all of him. To feel his naked skin touch hers. A fresh bolt of longing speared her, till her body felt wet and hot and needy.</p><p>He sat on the bed, and she wasn\u2019t sure where to look, so much did she want to see every inch of him, all at once.</p><p>He pushed the arisaid from her shoulders, revealing the vest and skirt she wore over her petticoat. \u201cYou\u2019re mine, Beth.\u201d He made quick work of her buttons. \u201cNot Fraser\u2019s,\u201d he said, tugging at her laces. \u201cThe only man who\u2019ll tell you who you can and can\u2019t marry is me.\u201d</p><p>Her clothes loosened, freeing her breasts, and the sensation stole her breath. She felt wild and free. \u201cAnd what if I don\u2019t listen?\u201d</p><p>Aidan leaned close. The stubble on his jaw scraped against her cheek as he whispered in her ear, \u201cThen I\u2019ll make you listen.\u201d He claimed a breast in his hand and kneaded it, thumbing her nipple.</p><p>Flinching from the shock of pleasure, she gripped his arms, curling her fingers tightly into the muscle of his biceps. \u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>He moved her hands aside, and she heard the pop of threads as he tugged her clothes down and off her body. \u201cI\u2019ll devise some torture.\u201d</p><p>Her heart was hammering, pounding her blood agonizingly close to the surface of her skin. She felt flushed, barely able to speak. \u201cIndeed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d He took her breast again, quickly replacing his hand with his mouth, and she cried out. The feel of him suckling her was too much, too exquisite a pleasure to bear. It felt wanton and sinful, and her body quivered, feeling on the verge of some precipice.</p><p>He pulled away, leaving her wet skin chilled in his absence. \u201cBecause the only man you\u2019ll be marrying is me.\u201d</p><p>She was panting now, an alarming heat thrumming through her body, and she felt as though she were enduring some frightful transformation, like a butterfly emerging from a chrysalis. She looked down at her body. But seeing her meager breast shining damp, hardened to a sharp, aching point, she blushed. She was nude before him, and sudden shyness made her cringe inside.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re magnificent,\u201d he said.</p><p>Clamping her eyes shut, she blindly reached for the blanket to pull it over her body. \u201cI\u2019m thin as a post, pale as a ghost ...\u201d</p><p>Warm fingers gently pinched her chin, and she opened her eyes to his affectionate smile. \u201cAnd silly as a loon.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her again, tenderly this time, until her shyness ebbed and she felt herself relax and kiss him back. He laved kisses down her neck, between her breasts, over and below them, murmuring, \u201cFool woman. Yours is the most beautiful, the finest of bodies.\u201d</p><p>She looked away, feeling fresh chagrin crumple her brow. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen many, I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>He was quiet for a moment, and her heart broke with it. But then he tipped her face back to his and said, \u201cAye, I\u2019ve seen women, Beth. And all of them pale compared to you. You\u2019re the only one. The finest and the loveliest of them all.\u201d</p><p>His mouth found hers again, and she found herself believing that she was glorious and luscious and kissable, and those tender kisses quickly turned hungry and deep. The whole of her responded to him, and she wrapped her hands around his back, roved them eagerly up his arms, frantic to touch him.</p><p>The linen of his shirt kept getting in her way, and she bucked her body up to him, tugging at the fabric. She tore her mouth from his. \u201cGet this off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAllow me.\u201d Aidan pulled away and did the work for her, ripping the shirt up over his head in one violent motion, then dove under the blanket to lie beside her.</p><p>Elspeth glimpsed his naked body, and she gasped, her muzzy gaze turning sharp. He was covered in scars.</p><p>He froze, uncertainty shuttering his features.</p><p>Inching the cover down, she gingerly touched a fingertip to the worst of his marks, the jagged, rippling brand that covered his left forearm. Though she wanted to look away, wanted his marks not to exist, she took in every last one, a map of his pain carved forever on his body. Broad swaths where shackles had rubbed him raw, thin bites of the whip, and the shining WP that named him property of some other man. \u201cOh, Aidan,\u201d was all she could manage, her voice tight with unshed tears. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Shifting onto his side, he scooted as far from her as the narrow bunk allowed. \u201cIt\u2019s who I am, Beth.\u201d</p><p>There was something foreign in his voice\u2014some vulnerability, some trepidation\u2014and her courage soared. Her dangerous rogue was just a man, and he needed her. She wrapped a steady hand around his forearm. \u201cYou\u2019re more than this.\u201d</p><p>She looked at the scars again, facing them full on, her fear gone. She smudged her thumb over the rippling skin of his brand. To mark a man as though he were cattle\u2014it was unthinkable. \u201cHow did you ever bear the pain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPain.\u201d He pulled his arm from her, and fisting his hand, studied it. \u201cSome say it lights a fire within.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd is that what you say?\u201d Though too timid to press her body to his, she was eager to maintain contact, and slid her arm beneath the blanket, idly feathering her fingers up and down his side.</p><p>\u201cIt certainly fueled my rage. My anger.\u201d He inhaled deeply, as though that alone could clear the memories, then cupped her face in his warm, broad hand. \u201cBut no, Beth. You\u2019re what\u2019s kindled me to life.\u201d</p><p>She continued to stroke her hand up and down his body, and he grew still. She could tell by the wicked flash in his eyes that he\u2019d become focused on her touch. \u201cAnd you\u2019re kindling more than that, I daresay,\u201d he said.</p><p>Abruptly, he shifted his hand to her back and pulled her close. It was a shock to feel the naked stretch of him, pressed against her, scorching her with his heat. With a firm and confident touch, he shifted her into a position he liked, and his mastery sent a sensual shiver rippling up from her very toes. Leaning close, he nipped her ear. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing to me.\u201d</p><p>His member was hard, pressing into her thigh. For a moment, for her, it was the only thing in the room, this mysterious evidence of his maleness, of his want for her, and she tried to picture him in her mind. \u201cNor you to me,\u201d she said breathlessly.</p><p>\u201cI see I\u2019ve shocked you.\u201d He chuckled, a low, seductive sound. Cupping her bottom, he pulled her closer still, until he was nestled in her cleft.</p><p>Her eyes grew wide. How that would ever fit inside her, she knew not.</p><p>He stilled, his every muscle taut and hard as sunwarmed granite against her. \u201cAre you certain you want this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuite,\u201d she said quickly, and his body eased. But then she hesitated. \u201cIt\u2019s just that...\u201d</p><p>He kissed one cheek and then the other. \u201cThat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it appears you\u2019re quite large and ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d he asked, with a kiss to each temple.</p><p>\u201cWell, tumescent.\u201d</p><p>He pulled from her with a laugh. \u201cTumescent, am I?\u201d</p><p>She grew shy again, uncertain. \u201cI\u2019ve not offended you, have I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in the least. Seeing as I\u2019m the one forced to bear up under it, I\u2019d be the first to agree upon my own ... tumescence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it quite heavy, then?\u201d she asked, genuinely curious.</p><p>Though he schooled his face to seriousness, she saw the humor in his eyes. \u201cNo, not heavy. But a ... a bit of a burden, nonetheless.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA burden?\u201d</p><p>He considered it. \u201cAye, one that tends to put all other thoughts from one\u2019s mind, you might say.\u201d</p><p>She glanced down to where he was hidden beneath the covers. \u201cMight I touch it?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled again, nuzzling her. \u201cI was hoping you might.\u201d</p><p>She found him under the covers and wrapped her hand around him. He was thick, and infinitely smoother than she\u2019d have guessed. \u201cOh, I quite like the feel of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad,\u201d he rasped, tilting his pelvis to her. \u201cNow show me how much.\u201d</p><p>Unsure of how to proceed, she drew her hand up along his length. The skin dragged in her palm, and it fascinated her, like steel beneath silk, but then she stroked him more and forgot her fascination, the knowledge that she was about to take this most intimate part of him into her body inflaming her beyond reason.</p><p>\u201cI want this.\u201d She cupped the head of him, rubbing the sticky wetness. \u201cGet closer to me, Aidan.\u201d</p><p>With a groan, he snatched her wrists and rolled her onto her back. His movements were quick and sure, and the desire simmering in his eyes brought hers to a fever pitch.</p><p>Twining their fingers, he pinned her hands over her head, his body hot and hard atop hers. Bearing most of his weight on his elbows, he kissed along the length of her arms, her breasts, he kissed her all over, chafing his cock in her wetness all the while.</p><p>She\u2019d lost all sense\u2014no longer a logical being, she\u2019d become pure feeling. Her mind, usually a clamor of thoughts, was reduced only to impulse and sensation. She knew only him, a hard wall of muscle, the rasp of his whiskers, the coarse hairs on his body. The sound of his breathing and his intermittent groans. The scent of salt air and their musk. The ship gently rolling, rocking their bodies closer, grinding his hardness so unbearably close to her, yet not close enough, in a teasing suggestion of what was to come.</p><p>She whimpered, her wanting of him become unbearable. \u201cNow, Aidan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt you. We need to\u2014\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t bear it any longer. Tearing her hands from his, she grabbed his ass. \u201cNow,\u201d she cried, pulling him into her.</p><p>There was a sharp pain, but his shout of pleasure blacked it from her mind, and he pumped into her until the pain was gone and all that was left was this joining. The feeling of their bodies connected. All she knew was the slide of their sweating bodies, the sweet ache of her breasts, and the acute want growing between her legs, the need for release, to fall spiraling with him into ecstasy.</p><p>She became aware that he was whispering in her ear. \u201cMine,\u201d he was telling her. \u201cYou\u2019re mine.\u201d</p><p>Her body seized, stilled, and for a breathless moment she floated in blackness, and then the blackness shattered, and she was filled with light. She felt her head rise from the bed, her body curling into his, like a puppet lost to herself, Aidan\u2019s body her master.</p><p>With a last, hard thrust, he shouted his climax, and collapsed over her. For a while, they simply lay there, panting, she unable to speak, unable even to close her slackened jaw.</p><p>And then they laughed. His was deep and unfettered, and she couldn\u2019t stop her giggles, so joyful she was, transformed. Her pleasure was too much, it had to bubble from her.</p><p>\u201cSweet heavens above.\u201d Aidan rolled off of her, still clutching her close. His laughter faded and he grew serious. \u201cElspeth Josephina Farquharson, I\u2019d sell my soul to the devil, I\u2019d call myself the devil\u2019s own, if only you\u2019d let me do that once more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes,\u201d she said, beaming up at him. \u201cMore, and more again.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 29</p><p>Aidan couldn\u2019t believe his ears. Or his eyes, or his body, for that matter.</p><p>\u201cAm I truly to have more of you?\u201d He smoothed the hair from her damp brow. Goose bumps shivered her skin, and he pulled the covers over her shoulders and hugged her closer. She was cool against his body, he like a furnace, on fire with a craving for her he\u2019d only begun to explore. \u201cI dare not believe it.\u201d</p><p>He molded her breast through the blanket, and her nipple hardened at his touch. He gently pinched her, and her instant reaction had his cock stiffening. She\u2019d feared she was too small for him, but really she was perfect. He\u2019d spent years around women who foisted their lush curves upon the world, propping their goods atop the shelves of velvet bodices, dazzling with silks, feathers, and threads of gold. \u201cYou were fashioned just for me, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it so too,\u201d she said, giving him a shy smile.</p><p>How the woman could be a sexual wanton one moment and a sweetly uncertain miss the next had won him.</p><p>She\u2019d given herself so freely. And the honor of lying with her would\u2019ve been gift enough, but Elspeth contained a fiery ardor that\u2019d staggered him. Her selflessness was humbling, but it was the memory of her consuming ardor that had him fantasizing already about when he might take her again.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t imagine a woman better suited to him. She was kindness and sweetness, yet with a passion that matched his own, she didn\u2019t fear the tempest broiling within him. Fashioned for him, indeed.</p><p>\u201cShall we test the theory?\u201d He tugged the covers down, and her skin pebbled in the cool air. He\u2019d not allow a moment for her shyness to return and took her breast in his mouth, nibbling and sucking, until he felt her body loosen and melt beneath him.</p><p>Hoisting himself up onto his hands, he shifted over her to lie propped against the wall on her other side. It was a new angle, and he took a moment to appreciate it. \u201cI could spend the day just staring at you.\u201d Tilting his head, he peered closer. \u201cBut what\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>He lifted her left arm above her head, momentarily transfixed to watch the mound of her breast rise with the motion. Then, cradling her arm in his, he studied a small birthmark at the juncture of her breast and rib. \u201cHow could I have missed this beauty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a heart,\u201d she said proudly.</p><p>Squinting, he saw that, surely enough, there was a tan spot shaped like a little heart beneath her breast. \u201cSo it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always thought it meant I was marked by love.\u201d She traced the mark, her fingers knowing where to go without her looking. She watched him, as if she expected he might challenge her assertion. \u201cIn Hindustan they read folks\u2019 palms. Some people read tea leaves. It seemed reasonable to infer some meaning in such a shape, and on my breast no less.\u201d</p><p>He, who\u2019d spent over half his life wearing a scowl, couldn\u2019t help but smile down at her. The woman was as fanciful as a poet, and he loved her for it. \u201cDestined to find true love, were you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I always knew I\u2019d feel love. It\u2019s been a surprise that I\u2019ve actually found it.\u201d</p><p>His heart soared. \u201cHave you indeed?\u201d He\u2019d not felt loved, not been loved, in many long years. He placed his hand over the mark, barely touching her skin. \u201cAnd this wee spot foretold all that?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, looking down to study her body. With a giggle, she tugged the blanket lower, revealing a fresh mark blooming on the uppermost curve of her other breast. \u201cAnd in case the universe missed it, it looks as though I\u2019ve been marked elsewhere too.\u201d</p><p>He brushed the spot with a tentative finger, cursing himself. \u201cOch, I\u2019ve kissed you too hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou kissed me just right.\u201d She snatched his finger in her hand.</p> <p>The tease in her voice did nothing to ease his worry. She was so delicate, and he so brutish, the thought that his body might be too much for her was appalling. \u201cDid I hurt you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Aidan\u201d\u2014she cupped his cheek, turning earnest\u2014\u201cnot at all. I didn\u2019t feel it.\u201d A naughty gleam lit her eyes. \u201cRather, I might have felt it, but I certainly didn\u2019t mind it.\u201d</p><p>Relief flooded him, and happiness too. He lay naked in bed with his Elspeth, and for this one stolen moment, the world felt right.</p><p>It was heaven, but time marched on, and too soon he\u2019d have to pay the devil his due. With a sigh, he craned his head to glance at the porthole. \u201cI curse that we\u2019ll lose the light soon. I must take you home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t let you.\u201d She tucked the blanket up over them with a snap. \u201cI won\u2019t go back there. I belong with you now.\u201d</p> <p>He shook his head, marveling at her conviction. He prayed that the force of her will was enough to bring truth to her words. \u201cYou do belong with me. And you shall stay with me, and soon. But not tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said yourself that you wanted to look at me all day. Here\u2019s your opportunity.\u201d</p><p>It was an opportunity they couldn\u2019t risk. It wasn\u2019t just that they needed to find her way out of this betrothal. It wasn\u2019t just her narrow-minded, tightfisted old father. He\u2019d not allow Elspeth to be ruined.</p><p>\u201cThink on it,\u201d he said. \u201cYour father will realize you\u2019re gone and scour Aberdeen looking for you. There\u2019ll be a scandal.\u201d</p><p>She waved her hand dismissively. \u201cMy father won\u2019t notice I\u2019m gone till the morning.\u201d</p><p>What she said couldn\u2019t possibly be true. He tried to think of another excuse, daring not to hope. \u201cThen the scandal will come tomorrow morning.\u201d</p> <p>She rolled onto her belly, nestling deeper under the covers, as though putting the issue to rest. \u201cWe\u2019ll simply have to come up with a plan by then.\u201d</p><p>Her appeal was undeniable. She was adorable, lying there with her chin cradled in her hands.</p><p>\u201cWhat sort of plan?\u201d he asked, beginning to waver.</p><p>\u201cWe need something worthy of the greatest of plots.\u201d She kicked her feet up in thought, not appearing to notice that the movement yanked the covers down, exposing her back. \u201cSomething more clever than the Trojan horse. Something more dastardly than Iago with Desdemona\u2019s handkerchief.\u201d</p><p>She was so precious and lovely and full of life, she sparkled with it. How nobody else noticed, he couldn\u2019t figure. Damned Fraser saw it, but Aidan had already decided he\u2019d simply have to blind the man.</p><p>The tip of her tongue peeked out from the corner of her mouth as she looked at him, great intent furrowing her brow. \u201cSurely we can think of something original.\u201d</p><p>Plotting was suddenly the furthest thing from his mind. \u201cI have nothing original in me, excepting original sin,\u201d he said with a wink.</p><p>\u201cAidan!\u201d She nudged him with her elbow. \u201cBut we need a plan.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have a plan.\u201d He ran his hand down her elegant back, pushing the blanket down as he went, revealing her pale and perfect bottom.</p><p>Might she really stay the night? Would he really get to hold her as she slept in his arms? Would he wake, and she\u2019d still be by his side? All the women he\u2019d been with, and he\u2019d never slept\u2014actually slept\u2014with a one of them. The notion was oddly exhilarating.</p><p>\u201cBut don\u2019t we need to figure out what to tell everyone?\u201d</p><p>The vision of her shoulders and back spread before him like supper on the table was more than he could bear. \u201cI have other needs right about now.\u201d</p><p>They had all night to figure out plots and explanations. He wanted to take her again. And once or twice more after that. Wrapping an arm around her slender waist, he kissed the back of her neck. \u201cAnd I find you\u2019re thinking too much for my tastes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have much on my mind,\u201d she said playfully.</p><p>But he could see by the growing heat in her eyes that she\u2019d be easy to convince. \u201cThen I\u2019ll kiss every last thought from your head.\u201d He sidled her into him, kissing and rubbing her shoulders and the back of her neck. When she nestled a hip nearer, he knew she was coming around.</p><p>He caressed a hand along that beautiful back, then down farther to slide his fingers home between her legs. He inched his body closer still, leaning down to nip a shoulder blade. He was hard and ready, and pressed his cock into her, but it was no relief.</p><p>\u201cBeth,\u201d he whispered. He wanted her under him, over him, wanted her every which way. \u201cI want you again.\u201d</p><p>She began to roll over, but he clutched her bottom, stopping her. \u201cNot yet. I\u2019m not done looking at your back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt my back?\u201d She turned all the way onto her belly, cradling her head in her arms, the pose languorous and sultry. She hitched her hip toward him in question. \u201cWhat do you propose to do with my back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could do many things.\u201d He shifted, settling closer over her, and wrapped his hand around her hip, his fingers nestled in the soft flesh of her belly. He imagined how easy it\u2019d be to pull her to him, to drive himself into her, and how deep.</p><p>\u201cI could do this.\u201d He tilted her, reaching around to knead her breast, then slid his hand lower, finding the source of her pleasure in the damp tangle between her legs. \u201cOr this.\u201d</p><p>She gasped and lifted her hips to him. Catching his cock on her ass, she shifted, and he slipped between her legs. \u201cWhat else could you do?\u201d</p><p>He rolled on top of her, bracing himself on elbows planted on either side of her. \u201cI could take you on your stomach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes,\u201d she purred, grinding against him. \u201cThat sounds lovely.\u201d</p><p>Though the lust that clouded his brain was dark, he laughed. Who was this strange and glorious woman beneath him? He should\u2019ve guessed she\u2019d be eager to try it all. \u201cWhat did I do to deserve you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe question is\u201d\u2014she took his hand from her breast to suck his finger into her mouth\u2014\u201cwhat will you do to keep me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll show you,\u201d he growled, and they were the last words spoken before he took her, claiming her as he told her he would.</p><p>And then they slept, and Aidan held Elspeth the whole night through.</p><p>Chapter 30</p><p>After enduring fifteen minutes of pounding on his office door, Fraser finally relented and answered, only to find his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s father standing in the doorway. Moonlight backlit the old man, casting his face in darkness and turning his frizzy hair ghostly white. The fellow looked as though he\u2019d just escaped Bedlam.</p><p>Fraser wondered if he might be making a mistake marrying into such a peculiar family. \u201cAre you drunk, sirrah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is she?\u201d Elspeth\u2019s father demanded, standing on his tiptoes to scan the darkened hallway.</p><p>Fraser stepped forward to block his view. Not that there was anything to hide\u2014he\u2019d deny the man simply on principle. The dinner hour had come and gone, and what sort of man went banging about Aberdeen at such a time? \u201cWhat brings you here at this hour?\u201d</p><p>Farquharson met his eyes. \u201cElspeth never came home. Girl said she was coming here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Fraser\u2019s mind raced, remembering their earlier meeting. They\u2019d fought, the chit claiming she didn\u2019t want their marriage. Could she have run away?</p><p>He stepped back to indicate that although the man wasn\u2019t entirely welcomed, he\u2019d be allowed inside.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d The old man stayed his ground, and his challenging tone raised him incrementally in Fraser\u2019s estimation. He\u2019d not have figured her father to have spine. \u201cWas she here or wasn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was here,\u201d Fraser said, wondering all the while if the girl had found herself another man. What else but an illicit dalliance would send her running into the night? Who else but a man would give her the courage? Rage surged in his gut like acid, but he tempered his words. \u201cWe had a bit of a disagreement. And she left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA disagreement?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, she\u2019s a silent thing, but willful,\u201d Fraser said tightly. Was she even still a virgin? He refused to be manipulated by an impoverished old man and his wheyfaced offspring. \u201cI\u2019ll certainly not take credit for her disappearance. She obviously needs a shorter rein.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInconstant creature,\u201d her father grumbled. \u201cI wanted a son, you know. A lad wouldn\u2019t go gadding about Aberdeen, going God knows where. A lad would know how to take care of business.\u201d</p><p>Business. He mustn\u2019t forget this all came down to business. Though he had to admit he\u2019d been swept up in the thrill of the chase. She wasn\u2019t as timid as he\u2019d first thought, and the challenge was more exhilarating than he\u2019d expected.</p><p>Fraser clapped her father\u2019s shoulder, adopting an easy attitude. \u201cCome in and we\u2019ll discuss this as men. She seems a bit skittish about being wed. No more than that.\u201d</p><p>Farquharson nodded, seeming to jump to some conclusion. \u201cShe\u2019s not much experienced with men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClearly.\u201d Though he begged to differ on that account.</p><p>Elspeth was a clever slip of a thing who clearly understood what their betrothal meant for her family\u2019s finances. He\u2019d wager it was an entirely different enticement that gave her cold feet\u2014likely she\u2019d met herself some strapping buck. But he chose to offer her father a different excuse, saying simply, \u201cShe\u2019s young yet.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, growing easy. \u201cShe is, at that.\u201d</p><p>Turning his back on the man, Fraser hid a smile as he shut the door. Listening to Farquharson speak, one would think his daughter still bore the first blush of youth. In truth, the girl could\u2019ve been married off ten years past, if only her father had two merks to rub together for a dowry. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt was a foolish argument,\u201d Fraser assured him. \u201cNothing to fash yourself over. These young girls can be unpredictable when it comes to men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot my Elspeth. She\u2019s a quiet one, as you\u2019ve seen for yourself. Men have never bothered with her.\u201d</p><p>Fraser shot him a look. \u201cYou can\u2019t tell me I\u2019m the first to engage her attentions.\u201d She was a meek sort of creature, but not without her appeal. He wondered what the family might be hiding. \u201cSurely she\u2019s expressed an inter-est in marriage before this?\u201d</p> <p>Unless it\u2019d been money, not a husband, the father had been waiting for. Fraser scowled, thinking the old man had cast a line, and he\u2019d bitten.</p><p>Her father shrugged. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t seem to pay men much mind.\u201d</p><p>Nor men her, Fraser reckoned. And this was the girl who\u2019d decided she didn\u2019t need an alliance with him? Little did she know he was doing her a great honor.</p><p>\u201cShe just has an eye for her books and her studies,\u201d the old man added.</p><p>Fraser grunted his agreement, but his thoughts were elsewhere. She\u2019d fooled her father. He\u2019d wager the girl had her eyes on something\u2014or someone\u2014other than books and studies. He\u2019d give her this: the little doxy was sharp. He\u2019d enjoy bringing her to heel.</p> <p>He endeavored to keep the studied joviality in his tone. \u201cEither way, these girls can be as silly as peahens, thinking a quarrel and a tease will kindle a man\u2019s ardor. I\u2019m sure her protests were no more than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSilly... aye.\u201d Farquharson\u2019s head bobbed in a relieved nod. Eyes snapping wide, he quickly added, \u201cBut she\u2019s clever too.\u201d</p><p>So the old man saw financial relief on the horizon and wasn\u2019t about to let it go. He wanted to sell his daughter to the highest bidder, even though she probably was no longer even a virgin.</p><p>Fraser thought of her eerily pale, all-seeing eyes and that lovely mouth, like the bud of a tea rose yet to bloom, and he still accounted her worth the price. Still, although the lass may have struck his fancy, nobody made a fool of him. He would have Elspeth, and fast, before some other man\u2019s seed quickened in her belly.</p><p>He altered course. \u201cActually\u201d\u2014he slapped a hand to his brow\u2014\u201cElspeth did say something. About visiting a friend. That\u2019s it ... foolish me ... I recall it now.\u201d</p><p>The Farquharsons would learn not to cross him at the bargaining table. So too would they realize just how deeply their need for his assistance ran.</p> <p>\u201cA friend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Fraser said. \u201cShe was off to visit a friend after she left here. You\u2019re certain you didn\u2019t see her at home? Might you have missed her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d her father said uncertainly.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s likely home already, safe abed for the night.\u201d Putting an amiable arm about the man\u2019s shoulders, Fraser opened the door and steered him out. \u201cAnd you, all the way here in Aberdeen. Why, while you\u2019re on my side of town, I insist you pay a visit to my favorite tavern.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think so?\u201d</p><p>Fraser tugged him down the alley. \u201cI know so. I\u2019m sure your Elspeth is sound asleep, and under the circumstances, I think a dram or two would be perfectly fine. Advisable, even. Seeing as I\u2019m to be your son-in-law, eh? Come now, I\u2019ll walk you there myself.\u201d</p><p>Hours later, Fraser sneaked from the pub, leaving the old man swinging a tankard of ale and singing a lusty tune. He was headed for a farm he knew he\u2019d find empty, a purloined bottle of whiskey in one pocket and a tinderbox in the other.</p><p>Chapter 31</p> <p>Elspeth woke as she had through the night, savoring the feel of Aidan\u2019s strong arm wrapped around her, his hand cupping her breast. They lay on their sides, and she nestled her rump more firmly into his lap, even though they were already as close as two people could be.</p><p>The boat rocked gently, and she waited to be lulled back to sleep by Aidan\u2019s heavy, rhythmic breathing. He seemed at peace, and she could only hope that the last embers of rage she\u2019d seen in his eyes were banked for good.</p><p>She\u2019d woken throughout the night to touch him, to inhale deeply the scent of him. Of them.</p><p>She brushed light fingers over his arm, the tickle of wiry hairs a revelation, a delight. He was warm and sure at her back, his strong arm holding her, and she felt safe and loved.</p><p>It was like a dream, and she still couldn\u2019t fathom how it was that she was the woman who lay by his side. She, no longer merely a dreamer, but one who realized dreams.</p><p>She waited to slide back into sleep, but this time it didn\u2019t come. Her body was awake, sensing sunrise was imminent, and thoughts clearing from their slumber, she was of a mind to see dawn warm the sky. And besides, her body had begun to register needs apart from Aidan that wanted tending.</p><p>She shifted away from him and shivered from the wash of cold air where his body had been. She stilled, grieving over their parting, and though she knew it had to come, she knew too that it would be brief. One day very soon she\u2019d be his bride, and then she\u2019d get to wake every day in Aidan\u2019s arms.</p><p>She gently shifted his arm to her hip, holding her breath, hoping not to wake him. Before he saw her, she wanted to comb fingers through her hair, wash the sleep from her face, and generally gather herself. Gradually, she edged from beneath the weight of his arm. His breathing changed, became shallower, and she waited until it grew regular again.</p><p>She slipped her feet from beneath the covers and began to sit up. An arm grabbed her tight around her belly. \u201cNo you don\u2019t,\u201d he said, his voice hoarse with sleep. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>Pressing his hand over her belly, she looked over her shoulder at him. It was dark in the cabin, but ambient moonlight shone through the porthole, and she could make out his bare shoulders above the covers. His hair was a dark tangle sprouting over his head, and tenderness swept her at the boyish look of it. \u201cI want to see the sun rise over the sea.\u201d</p><p>With a nod, he sat up.</p><p>She put a hand on his shoulder. \u201cYou needn\u2019t get up too. It\u2019s early yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I want to watch you watch the sun rise,\u201d he said, giving her bottom a tweak.</p><p>Their banter was easy and affectionate, and she knew a sharp twinge in her chest. It was acute, this feeling, of being seen and being loved. \u201cI\u2019d like that,\u201d she told him quietly.</p><p>He stood, and she couldn\u2019t tear her eyes from his naked form. Blades of silver moonlight shimmered over a body carved from stone. But then he turned, and she bit back a gasp as she saw that same light and shadow play along the marks on his back. Though she\u2019d felt the whip scars with her fingers, seeing them was a shock. Would always be a shock.</p><p>Turning, he caught her scrutiny, and she braced to watch shame or anger shutter his features. But instead, he walked to her, and with a gentle kiss on her forehead, said, \u201cIt\u2019s all right, Beth. It was years ago. I\u2019ve got you, and it\u2019s all all right now.\u201d</p><p>He extracted their clothes from the tangle of blankets, continuing as though nothing was amiss and the subject was closed. \u201cIt\u2019s just as well to be awake so early. I\u2019d have you arrive home before the sun gets too high in the sky.\u201d</p><p>She followed his lead and began to sort out her clothes. \u201cI\u2019ll be surprised if my father has even noticed my absence.\u201d</p><p>He shot her a look that, even in the dim cabin, she could see was doubtful. \u201cI don\u2019t want you compromised. There\u2019s no better time than first light to dock in Aberdeen harbor. The sailors are still drunk, and it\u2019ll be just fishermen roaming about, and they\u2019re not the ones who have me worried.\u201d Pulling his shirt over his head, he added, \u201cI don\u2019t trust Fraser, and I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll be taking this change in your wedding plans as well as you believe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think he\u2019ll have men at the docks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m certain of it,\u201d he said, stepping into his trews. \u201cI\u2019d like us to avoid the lot of them. He\u2019ll suspect something is at the root of your decision, and he\u2019ll have men sniffing around for some clue about what caused your change of heart. Which means you especially must stay away from him\u2014no more visits to the erstwhile fianc\u00e9.\u201d He helped her shrug into her vest. \u201cHave I your word?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve my word.\u201d She smiled.</p><p>Turning her to face him, he finished tying the laces of her bodice. \u201cNow,\u201d he said, placing his hands on her shoulders, \u201cI imagine you have needs to attend to.\u201d</p><p>She darted her eyes down. How mortifying to be discussing one\u2019s bodily needs with one\u2019s... pirate rogue.</p><p>Aidan chucked her chin. \u201cI\u2019ve spent the last hours studying ... nay, Beth, tasting every last inch of you. No need to be shy on account of this.\u201d</p><p>He led her up the stairs, pointing her to the side of the ship. \u201cJust beyond the sail, luvvie, and over the gunnel you go.\u201d</p><p>She was to relieve herself over the side of the ship? Dawn had begun to turn the sky gray, and she eyed the monochrome silhouettes of railings and hatches. \u201cSurely you don\u2019t mean that I should just ... hang there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, and you shall.\u201d With a pat on her rump, he sent her on her way. \u201cYou\u2019ll need to hold on, mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously.\u201d She headed toward the gunwale, considering. He\u2019d set the sails, heaving to for the night, and the water was calm beneath them, the boat bobbing gently. She looked over her shoulder to ask, \u201cAnd it\u2019s safe?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Tis,\u201d he said, but his back was already to her, busying himself on deck, and, she imagined, about to take care of his own needs.</p><p>She needed to go, and there was nothing for it. Hoisting her skirts, she set about her business, and couldn\u2019t help a quick giggle at the exhilarating freedom of it. \u201cWhat can you do with a drunken sailor,\u201d she belted out in her best singing voice, \u201cwhat can you do with a drunken sailor, errr-lie in the morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a wee daftie,\u201d he called out, laughing.</p><p>Ducking back from behind the sail, she returned to him, smoothing her skirts in an exaggeratedly ladylike fashion. \u201cI am no daftie. I\u2019m a pirate wench.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAre you?\u201d He put his arm around her and nestled her close, startling her as he stole a deep kiss. With it came a rush of sensation\u2014his morning beard scraping against her skin, the familiar stab of longing in her belly\u2014her body\u2019s response to him immediate.</p><p>He finally pulled from her, leaving her breathless. He wiped the damp from her bottom lip with a sensual sweep of his thumb. \u201cPirate wench, is it? Aye, I think you speak truly.\u201d</p><p>She beamed, pleased beyond reason.</p> <p>He opened a hatch to retrieve a woolen blanket then led her to the rear of the ship. \u201cIf you\u2019re a pirate wench, that would make me a pirate. And you know what pirates are known for.\u201d</p><p>She watched as he made a cozy nest of the stern. \u201cRavaging?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, ravaging, ravishment. All those.\u201d He lay down, patting the space beside him, beckoning.</p><p>She joined him on the blanket. \u201cHow very treacherous it all sounds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA menace, I am. Particularly to fair maidens.\u201d He cupped her head, leaning them back to watch as night turned to day. \u201cSo, beware. You\u2019ve requested a sunrise, but I cannot guarantee your subsequent safety.\u201d</p> <p>With a hand on his chest and a leg twined between his, she cuddled close. \u201cI wish we could just stay here, like this.\u201d</p><p>He sighed, stroking her hair. \u201cSoon, Beth.\u201d</p><p>They lay in silence for a time, watching as the sky faded from slate to indigo, to blue, and the rising sun cast strangely vivid slashes of light on soft rolling clouds overhead.</p><p>He took her hand in his, idly threading their fingers. \u201cIt\u2019s like we\u2019re floating away.\u201d</p><p>There was such romance in his voice, she fancied her chest might expand with her light heart, and it made her playful. \u201cAnd you call me the daftie?\u201d</p><p>Barking out a laugh, he grabbed her and pulled her roughly atop him. \u201cNot a daftie. \u2019Tis merely the musings of a pirate poet.\u201d He settled her more snugly over him, and she felt his hardness through her skirts. Clamping her in place with a firm hand on her buttocks, he warned, \u201cYou best not tease, luvvie. I\u2019ll make you walk the plank, or worse.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWorse?\u201d She ducked down to nip at his ear. She wriggled her hips suggestively, able to think of a thousand sweet tortures she\u2019d happily suffer at his hands. \u201cWhat worse could there be than walking the plank?\u201d</p><p>He became suddenly serious. \u201cYou could marry me. Be my pirate bride in truth. Forever.\u201d</p><p>She raised her brows. \u201cHave we not agreed to that already?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we did. But I have a plan. I\u2019ll marry you,\u201d he said earnestly, \u201cand I\u2019ll run your farm for you. With you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d be a sheep farmer?\u201d Her face fell, thinking of her tiresome existence. \u201cI can\u2019t ask you to choose such a life. You\u2019ve got your boat. You could have such grand adventures.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdventure?\u201d He gave a disdainful roll of his eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t you understand? I\u2019ve had my fill of adventure for a lifetime. We can still do this\u201d\u2014he gestured around them\u2014\u201cbut we\u2019ll sail after the workday is done. We can watch the sun set. We\u2019ll watch every sunrise, if that\u2019s your fancy. I\u2019ll teach our son to sail. Daughters too,\u201d he added, smile flashing. \u201cBut you and I, we\u2019ll manage the farm together. It\u2019s been doing better since I began to help, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter than ever,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>\u201cI want roots, Beth. I\u2019ve been long years without them, and I\u2019m finding I like the feel of being on Scottish soil again. I can contribute something of good. I can build something, we can build something, together. We\u2019ll make enough, and then set your father up someplace comfortable. In his own cottage, or even in Aberdeen town, if that\u2019s what he wishes. He doesn\u2019t need coin from some old merchant when you and I will get by just fine.\u201d</p> <p>She stared at him in dazed silence. He didn\u2019t want to sail off into the sunset, abandoning her\u2014and her many responsibilities\u2014for grand adventures. He\u2019d leave all that behind, to live with her, tending sheep on a modest slice of land.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d he asked, sounding uncertain. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>In her eyes, he\u2019d been a hero, but now he was her hero. She traced a light finger along his brow, saying simply, \u201cI think it\u2019s a grand plan.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, tangling fingers in her hair, pulling her down for a joyful kiss.</p><p>They parted, and her thoughts began to race. Her father would be difficult to convince. With next to no worldly goods to call his own, Aidan brought nothing to this union. But if they tread carefully, she knew she\u2019d find a way.</p><p>\u201cYou and I will need to part,\u201d she told him, her mind working. \u201cBut just long enough for me to talk sense to my father. When we dock today, can it be near Dunnottar? If I walk home from there and am seen, I can devise some believable subterfuge as to how I\u2019d been away visiting Anya.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSubterfuge.\u201d A dark shadow flickered on his face. \u201cYou mean you\u2019ll lie. I hate making you lie.\u201d</p><p>She propped onto an elbow, speaking in earnest. \u201cYou\u2019ll make an honest woman of me yet, Aidan MacAlpin. All we need to do is persuade my father.\u201d</p><p>They locked eyes. She watched as he grew convinced, his gaze transforming from somber to mischievous.</p><p>He hiked her skirts up. \u201cThat can\u2019t be all we need to do ...\u201d</p><p>She knelt over him. The air on her legs was brisk, but the feel of the sun warming her naked skin was a revelation. Dangerous and delicious, just like Aidan. And just as with him, there was nothing that felt righter in the world.</p><p>Chapter 32</p><p>It\u2019d taken Elspeth the entire sail back to convince Aidan to let her walk home on her own. In the end, it was his boat that decided it. The coast off Dunnottar Rock offered good mooring for the likes of Cormac\u2019s fishing boat, but the Journeyman was a big enough sloop to require docking in Aberdeen harbor.</p><p>She happily meandered along the path, heading home, her mind skipping hither and yon, thinking about Aidan, replaying their time together, remembering all he\u2019d done and said. Might they truly have a son or daughter someday for him to sail with, for her to read to? It was enough to make her chest expand so that she thought she might float up to the sky with her happiness.</p><p>A plume of smoke drifted faintly on the horizon, and her mind began to wander further afield, wondering who was burning what and why. But the smoke grew darker the closer she got to her cottage, its smell more acrid. Her heart began to hammer in her chest.</p><p>As she crested the hill, her world stopped, and she was plunged into a nightmare. Their cottage was a blackened ruin. \u201cDa! Oh God, Da!\u201d Elspeth galloped down the hill, shrieking for her father, trying in vain to scream herself awake. But it was no dream.</p><p>She got as close as she could to the cottage before the scorched earth became too unbearably hot through the leather of her shoes, and peered in, making sense through the smoke and shadows. Despite the heat, her skin prickled, cold and clammy. There was not much inside but ashes and charred stone. A few blackened pages from her books were littered across the floor. A cast-iron pot sat on the hearth, looking eerily untouched by the devastation.</p><p>Other than that, there was nothing. She had nothing.</p><p>The stench, the sight, she took it all in, but her brain couldn\u2019t comprehend. Shock made her gasp for air, but she sucked in too much smoke and coughs racked her. Backing away, she scrubbed the tears from her face, breathing into the crook of her elbow.</p><p>While she was gone, a fire had raged. While she\u2019d floated away with Aidan, her world had burned. She\u2019d been thinking only of herself while flames blazed with a life of their own, razing everything then petering out, leaving naught but singed stone ringed by a halo of blackened earth.</p><p>If she\u2019d been paying mind to her family, to their needs, if she\u2019d only been home, this wouldn\u2019t have happened.</p><p>But what of her father? Had he been here? \u201cDa!\u201d she screamed again, hoping\u2014praying\u2014he was sleeping off the night somewhere in an Aberdeen tavern.</p><p>Fresh dread prickled through her, choking her with nausea, as she realized who had been home. Home, and quite likely helpless. Achilles.</p><p>\u201cNo, God,\u201d she cried, wondering how she could have forgotten her puppy. She bolted from the cottage, scanning all around her. \u201cAchilles!\u201d she called, racing across the glen, shouting over and over for her dog, but she was greeted only by silence.</p><p>The silence grew louder. It was unsettling and surreal, and only then did it strike her that the farm had never been silent. Always there\u2019d been sound, always the incessant bleating of sheep that\u2019d driven her mad. But now there was nothing.</p><p>Girding her courage, she made her way to the paddock.</p><p>A gruesome scene slowly came into focus. She saw the sheep, and her gorge rose. They lay slaughtered, littering their pen. Someone had tried to burn them alive. But wool didn\u2019t burn, and their bodies stank of charred fleece and butchered flesh.</p><p>She clapped a hand to her mouth, swallowing convulsively, refusing to be sick. She\u2019d bear this. She\u2019d been the cause of it, and she\u2019d bear it.</p><p>This was no accident. Somebody had done this, somebody had intentionally destroyed their farm.</p><p>Forcing herself to cling to reason, she took in the scene, trying to make sense of it. The scorch marks ended several feet from the cottage, then began again near the paddock. And though nothing had burned in the field, the fence had been toppled in places.</p><p>Who would do such a thing? Who had they angered? Who did they even know outside their small community?</p><p>Fraser. Her blood froze in her veins. The answer was Fraser.</p><p>It was her fault. She\u2019d enraged the old merchant, and he\u2019d retaliated by destroying her home.</p><p>\u201cYou hussy,\u201d a familiar voice shouted.</p><p>She turned to see her father stumbling toward her. Relief surged through her, seeing him alive. And then dread mingled with her relief, seeing the fury in his eyes.</p><p>He stood before her, swaying, and the sour smell of ale amid the acrid cinders sickened her. The morning light was unforgiving, and he looked like he\u2019d aged twenty years in one night. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou dare come back here,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cThis is your fault. If you\u2019d been here, I\u2019d have been here. But instead I had to search all over Aberdeen for your fool hide. If we\u2019d been here, the farm would\u2019ve been fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ... I was at Dunnottar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t lie to me,\u201d he spat. \u201cYou were with him. And now we\u2019ve nothing left because of it.\u201d</p> <p>She glanced behind her to the cottage, fueled by desperation. \u201cWe can rebuild\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t build nothing from nothing.\u201d He shook his head, disgust curling his lip. \u201cHe sullied you, didn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s none of your business,\u201d she snapped, grateful to feel ire replacing her despair.</p><p>He looked incredulous. \u201cDon\u2019t you get it, girl? It is my business. You\u2019d best hope Fraser will still take you, because if he don\u2019t marry you, both of us is off to the poorhouse.\u201d</p><p>The thought of marrying Fraser was a worse nightmare even than the sight of their smoldering farm. Her father had the right to force her into wedlock, but she was a pirate wench now and she would dig in her heels. \u201cI can\u2019t marry him,\u201d she cried. \u201cI will not.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYe can and will.\u201d He stalked toward her, for a moment looking like a younger man again, and it sent a shiver of foreboding up her spine.</p><p>She took a step back. \u201cI won\u2019t. I\u2019m to marry Aidan. He\u2019s strong and able. He\u2019ll help us rebuild.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan Aidan repay our debts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour debts,\u201d she snapped. \u201cYour choices, your vices. These are your debts I\u2019m paying for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be a fool. They\u2019re yours too. That money filled your belly too. Put a roof over your head. If you\u2019d been a lad, you could\u2019ve helped more\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could I have helped more?\u201d Sadness swamped her, a dull ache in her chest. Her father was eager to throw her to the wolves in order to save his own hide, sacrificing her for financial gain.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you how you can help,\u201d he said, his chin trembling with temper kept barely in check. \u201cYou marry that man Fraser, or our debts will see us both sent to the poorhouse.\u201d</p><p>The horrific truth was dawning. Her father was in debt and they hadn\u2019t the money to pay. But he\u2019d been wrong on one count: they\u2019d be lucky if they were only sent to the poorhouse. Idle, able-bodied poor were as likely to be shipped off to the Indies or America.</p><p>She had no choice. They were destitute. It was marriage for her, or some worse fate for the two of them.</p><p>She became frantic. Her world was spinning out of control, and she was powerless to stop it. \u201cPlease, Da,\u201d she pleaded. \u201cDon\u2019t you see? It\u2019s Fraser who\u2019s behind this. He\u2019s the one who destroyed the farm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then he did a tidy job of it, because now you have no choice. You just pray he\u2019ll still take you. God willing, he\u2019ll still keep you even though you\u2019re no maiden. Now stop that caterwauling. It\u2019s no\u2019 like you, and I don\u2019t like it.\u201d He grabbed her arm and began to drag her up the hill.</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d She jerked her arm away. \u201cWhat of the farm? What are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaft girl, what do you think I\u2019m doing? I\u2019m taking you to him.\u201d</p><p>It was all happening too fast. Fraser had held the last card, and he\u2019d played it perfectly. She and her father had bills to pay, and no means to pay them. Aidan had no money either, and if he saddled himself with her, he\u2019d be in line for the workhouse, too. She couldn\u2019t bear the thought of him being held captive again.</p> <p>She had no choice but to marry Fraser. Life as she knew it was ending.</p><p>She planted her feet, making her father stumble. \u201cCan I at least say good-bye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo that devil MacAlpin? And let the blackguard steal you away? I think not, girl.\u201d He tugged her onward. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky I don\u2019t let Fraser\u2019s men deal with him.\u201d</p><p>Another fact dawned, and the shock of it impaled her. If Fraser had done all this simply to have her as a bride, what would he do to Aidan if he were to discover him?</p><p>Her heart choked her throat until it was difficult to breathe, impossible to swallow.</p><p>Aidan sought the man with the black pearl, a man connected to Fraser, and it was only a matter of time before he found both men. If Fraser realized she loved Aidan, he\u2019d surely kill him. And with a fleet of dockside thugs on his payroll, she didn\u2019t doubt his ability.</p><p>She thought of those butchered sheep. What tortures might Fraser devise if he discovered Aidan had been the one to deny him the pleasure of her maidenhead? Aidan, who\u2019d already suffered torments enough for one lifetime.</p><p>She had to keep him safe. And the only way to do that was to go to Fraser. To marry him.</p><p>By sacrificing herself, her very life, she\u2019d keep Aidan free. The image of his scarred wrists and back was seared into her memory\u2014she\u2019d never want to inflict such pain on him again.</p><p>Fraser heard voices at the door and felt his mouth curl into a smile. Albert and Elspeth Farquharson, he\u2019d wager, and right on time.</p><p>The whole fire episode had been so unlike him\u2014it\u2019d taken him a full hour to wash the stink of smoke from his body\u2014but he wasn\u2019t one to suffer a plan going awry. He\u2019d gotten it into his head that a bit of sheep pasturage in the guise of a wool farm would be just the thing to explain away his not entirely legal profits in the slave trade.</p><p>Besides, he hadn\u2019t been about to sit idly by as the girl took it in her head to spurn him. Even less would he endure being jilted for some other fool\u2014likely some sodding farmer, or whatever sort of man it was who struck the fancies of young girls.</p><p>Though using alcohol as an incendiary had been inspired, torching their farm to the ground had been an ordeal. Yet the moment Elspeth and her father entered his office, he knew at once it\u2019d been worth it.</p><p>She was lovely, pale and fragile, with the bloom of exertion on her cheeks. Or perhaps it was anger he saw in her blush, and he thought he might just prefer that even more. He\u2019d want this girl beneath him even if she hadn\u2019t come with a strip of land he could claim for profit.</p><p>\u201cWell, good day to the both of you.\u201d He stood and gestured for them to take a seat. \u201cPlease join me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExpecting us, were you?\u201d She looked at him with a spark in her eyes. There was anger in her gaze, but something else too. Fear.</p><p>It sent a bolt of heat to his loins.</p><p>He knew the sheep had put the fear there\u2014or rather, what he\u2019d done to them. He could see the horror of his butchery in her eyes. The cursed beasts had as much wool between their ears as they had on their backs, and slaughtering the lot of them had been more chore than challenge. But it\u2019d been the crowning touch, and just the thing to show Elspeth what came to pass when people crossed him.</p><p>\u201cOn the contrary. After our last conversation, I understood we were to break our engagement.\u201d He adjusted the chair as she sat, thinking there was but one thing to be broken, and it was she. He\u2019d break her like a horse, and what a pleasure it would be. \u201cBut I see a new light dancing in your eyes. Have I reason to hope?\u201d</p><p>She scowled at him, and it took all his control not to smirk. Underneath the shy exterior, this one was a firebrand.</p><p>A thousand times smarter than her dimwit father, and a pleasure to spar with. Her pretty lips thinned. \u201cHope? You\u2019d better hope\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is,\u201d her father said, quickly cutting her off, \u201cwe\u2019re of the hope that you took your last interview with Elspeth to be no more than it was: the silly games of a maiden.\u201d</p><p>Fraser smirked. Maiden indeed.</p><p>\u201cI enjoy games.\u201d He pinned Elspeth with a look. She squirmed, and he relished the power he had over her. Smart and willful maybe, and not as timid as he\u2019d first thought, but she\u2019d acquiesce to his whims within the year. He\u2019d relish making her yield to him. It was invigorating, like what he imagined a man felt when breaking a wild animal\u2014bringing that spirit to heel, proving that you were its master.</p><p>It was exhilarating, better than any hunt. He\u2019d forgotten what it was to feel young, yet here he was, feeling a man of twenty again. Was that how marriage would be? He found himself looking forward to it.</p><p>She had a keen mind and sharp, all-seeing eyes, unlike all the other simpering misses he\u2019d ever met. She\u2019d eventually realize he and she were mental matches. She\u2019d grow to appreciate his wisdom.</p><p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t realized just how staid my life had become,\u201d he told her, finding himself gratifyingly moved by his own honesty. He puffed up, believing himself a very great good man. It was indeed time to take a wife\u2014all the brilliant men in powerful circles had them. \u201cUntil I met you, my dear. You\u2019ve added a bit of sauce to the stock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThem\u2019s welcome words,\u201d her father said. \u201cBecause we\u2019re of a mind to step up the wedding a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo hasten our nuptials?\u201d He shot her a pointed look\u2014 he wanted to hear her say the words. Wanted to hear her beg him. \u201cCould that be true, Elspeth? Do you wish to marry me so very badly?\u201d</p><p>It gave him great satisfaction to watch the fire kindle in those pale blue-and-yellow eyes.</p><p>She gave him a tight nod, and it was all he could do not to laugh outright.</p><p>He was a veritable god of planning, he thought, concealing his surge of triumph. First, there\u2019d been his scheme to trade workers for cotton, avoiding the Crown and her taxes. Then came his masterful handling of the Farquharsons. And now he\u2019d be the savior who\u2019d come in and rebuild her idiot father\u2019s farm, setting in place a sham enterprise with which to explain away his profits.</p><p>And he\u2019d win himself a young wife in the bargain.</p><p>What a welcome diversion this was proving. He decided to prolong it a bit more. \u201cWhat, pray, has brought about such a welcome change of heart?\u201d</p><p>Though he\u2019d posed the question to Elspeth, it was her father who answered. \u201cThere\u2019s been an accident, see. And ... we were hoping ...\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He let her father flail for a moment, then broke in. \u201cOh my. An accident? I hope nothing untoward has come to pass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you know very well what\u2019s come to pass,\u201d Elspeth said in a tight voice.</p><p>\u201cMind yourself,\u201d her father scolded from the corner of his mouth. The old man shifted in his seat, looking uncomfortable. \u201cThere\u2019s been an accident at the farm. A fire.\u201d</p> <p>Fraser steepled his fingers, watching Elspeth\u2019s reaction. How wrong his first impressions of her had been. Initially, he\u2019d thought her a quiet, plain wisp of a thing, but now such a whirl of emotions animated her face. He decided it was that which turned her pretty.</p><p>Would she fight him this much in the marriage bed? Would he feel as much triumph when she finally submitted? She\u2019d be a treat indeed.</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019ll need a place to stay,\u201d he said, gratified by his own magnanimous tone. He\u2019d spent many years clawing his way from the gutters\u2014to play the role of wealthy benefactor was pleasing. \u201cSome coin to get you by.\u201d</p><p>Her father\u2019s eyes brightened. \u201cThat\u2019s it precisely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we can certainly step up our wedding plans.\u201d He gave his intended a warm look, amused to watch her bridle in response. \u201cIt takes two weeks to proclaim the banns, but I\u2019ve a minister in my pocket at my estate in Arbroath who\u2019ll wed us as soon as I say.\u201d</p> <p>Though he doubted she was a virgin, he deemed it just as well. As long as bastard seed hadn\u2019t taken root, he\u2019d be happy to have young Elspeth come to him a woman primed. She was a frail thing, looking as though she might break, and he\u2019d rather not have maiden tears flowing on his wedding night.</p><p>And besides, he\u2019d enjoy accustoming her to his ways. He\u2019d make her rue the day she\u2019d allowed some other man to touch her.</p><p>Fraser grew thoughtful. That would be his next adventure\u2014finding the identity of the man who\u2019d deflowered her. \u201cI\u2019ll take you to Arbroath. In fact, we\u2019ll leave today.\u201d</p><p>A trap, to tempt her wayward suitor from the woodworks.</p><p>Chapter 33</p><p>Never before had Aidan known such lightness in his heart. He\u2019d dropped Elspeth at Dunnottar as she\u2019d asked, then turned the Journeyman back around to dock at his hired slip in Aberdeen, tasting the salt air in his broad grin all the while.</p> <p>He was a man transformed, and he had Elspeth to thank for it. Her guileless ways were refreshing, renewing. And when she laughed, she shined warmth and light on the dark corners of his soul, chasing away his rage and leaving joy in its place. Her delight in the little things\u2014in a story well told, in a fresh-picked apple\u2014had reminded him how it was to feel happiness once more.</p><p>She still didn\u2019t understand just how much she\u2019d changed him. She\u2019d been succor to his tortured body and soul, yet she still didn\u2019t seem to see how much he needed her. It was no matter, he thought as he strode from Dunnottar to her farm. He\u2019d be only too pleased to spend the rest of his life proving his devotion.</p><p>She\u2019d seemed dumbfounded to hear that he\u2019d marry her and run her farm. Little did she know, the idea of a modest slice of farmland and a run-down crofter\u2019s cottage was heaven, particularly if it meant he\u2019d have Elspeth by his side. He was a free man now, but freedom was nothing without pride. Yet with her as his wife, he\u2019d be a man standing tall.</p><p>His mind went to her father, and he shoved the thoughts away, not yet willing to address his lingering doubts. He\u2019d never felt this light, this joyful, and he\u2019d savor it just a bit longer before facing the details of reality.</p><p>Besides, Elspeth seemed certain she could convince her father, and so he\u2019d be certain too, for her sake. And so, instead of entertaining the dark thoughts that were his wont, his long strides quickly cut the distance to their farm, imagining she\u2019d already explained everything to the man.</p><p>Perhaps they\u2019d both be waiting in the fields to greet him. Perhaps Albert Farquharson had agreed already to their union. Surely the man saw what good Aidan had done for the farm, what more he could do.</p><p>He crested the hill, and his heart seized in his chest. The stench of ashes choked his lungs. Bodies of sheep baked in the sun. Her farm was a smoldering rubble.</p><p>Elspeth.</p> <p>He wanted to scream her name, to cry out, but couldn\u2019t make a sound, could barely breathe. Anguish flooded him. He\u2019d banked it behind a dam, but seeing the devastation, the dam crumbled, and despair swamped him once more, so agonizingly familiar.</p><p>He was cursed. He was as charred a ruin as her cottage, and the drifting smoke was his soul dispersing, inconsequential, up to the heavens.</p><p>Gritting his teeth, he forced breath in and out of his lungs. He forced his mind to reason. Forced his legs to work beneath him, taking him to her farm nestled in the glen below.</p><p>As he neared, the sight made his blood run cold, but he assured himself that Elspeth was safe. The ashes were cooling, the smoke thinning. It was an old fire. It\u2019d raged when she was aboard the Journeyman, safe by his side.</p><p>He shouldn\u2019t have let her go. He should\u2019ve kept her close, kept her safe until they were wed.</p><p>Safe, he made himself believe. Surely she was safe.</p><p>But what if she weren\u2019t? A chill crept along his flesh. Because this was no accident.</p><p>He went to the paddock, taking in the carnage. This was the work of man\u2019s hands, and he knew whose.</p><p>But where was his Beth? Perhaps she\u2019d taken shelter with Angus, the neighboring farmer. Even as it occurred to him, his legs were racing there. Perhaps she was at the neighboring farm, even now, waiting for him.</p><p>Her blasted puppy bowled him over as he neared Angus\u2019s homestead, and damned if Aidan wasn\u2019t glad to see the scamp. He bent to pat the dog, praying that when he stood, he\u2019d look up to find Elspeth walking toward him. \u201cAchilles, lad. Where\u2019s your mistress?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not here,\u201d he heard a voice call from behind him.</p><p>His last thread of hope snapped. He stood and stared Angus down. \u201cWhere\u2019s Elspeth?\u201d The farmer gave him a slow and considering look, and the man\u2019s stoicism infuriated Aidan. \u201cWhy do you just stand there? Where is she? What\u2019s happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe came with her father. He said he needed to deliver her to her fianc\u00e9 in Aberdeen. I lent him my cart.\u201d</p><p>Her fianc\u00e9? Cold dread prickled through his chest. That could only mean one thing: her marriage to Fraser was on. \u201cWhy would you do such a thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I not?\u201d Angus went about his business, leaning his chaff fork along the side of his barn. \u201cFarquharson said it was where she needed to be. She\u2019s to be married, and soon.\u201d</p><p>Aidan felt a body approach and turned to find Cormac standing at his side. The sight stunned him.</p><p>\u201cI saw the smoke from my boat,\u201d Cormac said, glancing from one man to the other. His body was tensed, with a hand on the dagger at his hip. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened here?\u201d</p><p>Cormac looked as though he were ready to throttle Angus first and ask questions later. Aidan wondered briefly, would Cormac truly stand by his side, without question or hesitation? In that instant, he thought his twin just might.</p><p>He greeted Cormac with a meaningful bob of his head. \u201cElspeth\u2019s cursed drunk of a father took her. She\u2019s to marry some merchant, whom\u201d\u2014he glared pointedly at Angus\u2014\u201cshe doesn\u2019t want.\u201d</p><p>Angus shrugged. \u201cThat\u2019s no concern of mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t you see the woman was upset?\u201d She\u2019d surely been upset, hadn\u2019t she?</p><p>He felt Cormac\u2019s hand at his shoulder. Could his brother read his thoughts so well, or was it simply that he sensed how dangerously close to violence Aidan was getting?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t ken the lass\u2019s mind,\u201d Angus said. \u201cShe was silent as a mouse. But then she usually is.\u201d</p><p>He bristled at the comment, but Cormac was quick to switch focus, asking, \u201cWho is this merchant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamned blackguard is no good,\u201d Aidan said. \u201cElspeth would never marry him of her own choice.\u201d</p><p>The brothers\u2019 eyes met, and Cormac must\u2019ve seen the truth of the situation in Aidan\u2019s expression because he gave a sharp, knowing nod. \u201cThen there\u2019s something else afoot.\u201d</p><p>Angus pondered this as he coiled a stretch of rope and hung it from a nail on the side of his barn. \u201cHer father said the man was going to help them.\u201d</p><p>The farmer\u2019s offhand reporting of events was bringing Aidan\u2019s blood to a boil. \u201cI don\u2019t care what her father thinks,\u201d he said, his jaw tight. He tossed off a cold, mocking laugh. \u201cHelp them ... He\u2019s delivering her into the hands of the man who destroyed their farm.\u201d</p><p>That seemed to get Angus\u2019s attention. His attitude went from cool to guarded. \u201cBut Farquharson said the man\u2019s a pillar of the community, or some such.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho comes into his wealth illegally.\u201d</p><p>Angus rubbed his chin, deep in thought, and Aidan wanted to slug him. While they deliberated, his Elspeth was probably already in Fraser\u2019s clutches.</p><p>Cormac\u2019s hand was once again on his shoulder with a tempering grip, and Aidan wondered if his fury was that obvious. \u201cDo you have proof?\u201d his brother asked.</p><p>\u201cI have papers, but they\u2019re back at Dunnottar. They raise doubt enough.\u201d He gave his brother a weighty look. \u201cHe\u2019s linked to the pirate who took me.\u201d</p><p>Cormac tensed. \u201cDoes the lass know it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, there\u2019s not much that slips by Beth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she went with her father with nary a fuss,\u201d Angus said.</p><p>Aidan stared, his voice, his heart, a blank. He was grateful when Cormac challenged the farmer, saying, \u201cYou\u2019re saying she went willingly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeemed like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019d never willingly agree to marry him.\u201d Aidan began to pace, the need for action exploding through him. Elspeth would never have chosen to go, which meant the men had done something to coerce her. He\u2019d kill Fraser. Even if Elspeth had gone willingly. He\u2019d kill the man with the black pearl too. He\u2019d kill them all. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNor I,\u201d Cormac said.</p><p>Aidan\u2019s nod for his twin was brusque, but a powerful wash of relief drove it. He had Cormac\u2019s support as much as he ever did.</p><p>Though Aidan read suspicion in Angus\u2019s eyes, the farmer only shrugged, saying, \u201cThat\u2019s what happens to women. They get carted away to husbands not of their choosing.\u201d</p> <p>Aidan could bear it no longer\u2014his rage finally erupted. \u201cGood God, man. Maybe that\u2019s what happened to your woman. Not to mine.\u201d</p><p>Icy fury stole across Angus\u2019s features. He stood, staring at Aidan with dead eyes.</p><p>Aidan knew he\u2019d spoken out of turn, and part of him hoped the farmer might fight him because of it. He\u2019d welcome a good bout of fisticuffs\u2014anything was preferable to this inaction. But the man only stared in frozen silence, and so Aidan spun, heading in the direction of Aberdeen.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take you.\u201d Cormac stopped him, his voice demanding.</p><p>Aidan looked over his shoulder. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll take you,\u201d Cormac repeated. \u201cAberdeen is miles from here. It\u2019d be hours on foot.\u201d He nodded toward the water. \u201cMy fishing boat\u2019s docked just yonder. I\u2019ll take you to Justice Port.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ll go with you,\u201d Angus said in a quiet baritone. The MacAlpin men gaped at the farmer in disbelief, but Angus only dusted off his hands, dismay and irritation settling on his usually stoic features. \u201cI don\u2019t ken what\u2019s afoot, but I do know Miss Elspeth. She\u2019s a good egg, and if her sot of a father has put her in harm\u2019s way, then I\u2019d be happy to come to her aid.\u201d</p><p>If the offer hadn\u2019t changed his opinion of Angus, the way the man snatched up his farm tools would have. He grabbed what looked like a reaping hook and a shepherd\u2019s crook, wielding one in each hand with as much ardor as another might wield weapons.</p><p>Aidan raised a brow in question, and Angus nodded to Aidan\u2019s sword. \u201cBetter than your blade.\u201d</p><p>Cormac laughed low. \u201cWhen you make your mind up about a thing, you really commit, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>The farmer only shrugged in answer, already headed down the path to the shore.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a quick sail,\u201d Cormac said as they caught up to him. \u201cShe\u2019s slower than your sloop\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut all the better to navigate the harbor,\u201d Aidan finished, knowing how tight the Aberdeen slips were. \u201cYou\u2019ll just drop us. Even if you did have warrant to dock, since the trouble you caused\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe caused,\u201d Cormac corrected.</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d Aidan shot him a grin. \u201cSince the trouble we caused, I think you\u2019d best make haste away from port before we\u2019re recognized.\u201d</p><p>As they neared their destination, Aidan\u2019s heart went to his throat. There was a gaping stretch where the Endeavor had been docked. \u201cThey\u2019re gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know that,\u201d Cormac said, rowing to an empty patch of harbor.</p><p>Angus scowled. \u201cHe\u2019s a sailor too? I thought this Fraser was a knit merchant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have a boat.\u201d Aidan leaped onto the pier, followed by Angus. \u201cHis partner does. A ship.\u201d</p> <p>The ship that\u2019d stolen him away, so many years ago. And now it was out there somewhere, stealing his Elspeth away. He shook off the feeling, thinking he needed to gather himself, battening down emotion as he\u2019d furl a boat\u2019s sail.</p><p>\u201cGood luck,\u201d Cormac told him. \u201cWhoever this pirate is, I couldn\u2019t save you from him. But I know you can save Elspeth now.\u201d</p><p>Aidan reached down to clasp Cormac\u2019s hand. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>When he turned to Angus, the man was watching him with startlingly sharp eyes. It gave him the unsettling sensation that the farmer could read him like a book. Aidan had completely mistaken him\u2014he was no dullard at all. He gave him a grim smile, eyeing the man\u2019s farm tools. \u201cYour weapons?\u201d</p><p>Hefting the awkward tools in his hands, Angus headed up the pier, an answering grin spreading slowly across his face. \u201cThere are weapons all around. The best are the ones least likely.\u201d</p><p>Aidan shook his head with a quick laugh. \u201cSo it is, farmer.\u201d</p><p>As Angus\u2019s smile faded, it struck Aidan how that\u2019d been the first glimpse of humor he\u2019d ever seen on the man\u2019s face. He wondered if it would be the last. Trying to get a bead on him, Aidan watched as he tucked the reaping hook in the belt of his breacan feile and strolled on, using the shepherd\u2019s crook as a walking stick.</p><p>An errant thought struck him, carried on a surge of irrational jealousy. \u201cWhat\u2019s an oat farmer doing with a tool suited for sheep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want your woman, MacAlpin.\u201d Angus didn\u2019t break his stride. \u201cDon\u2019t be a fool. She doesn\u2019t want me, or my gifts. Never has. I was going to find something to trade her for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he asked, skeptical. Lately, he was of the mind that all men would surely fall in love with Elspeth, if they\u2019d but open their eyes to her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen how Farquharson treats the lass, as I\u2019m sure you have. And, like you, I don\u2019t much like it.\u201d</p><p>Elspeth had told him of Angus and Anya\u2019s thwarted affair, and remembering it, he gave the farmer a grudging nod. The man had known Elspeth for years before Aidan had even met her.</p><p>Somebody stood at the head of the pier, leaning casually against one of its rotted wooden piles. Though his back was to them, Aidan could tell by his broad shoulders and soiled overcoat that he was the sort of lowlife who knew the goings-on dockside.</p><p>\u201cWhen\u2019d the Endeavor cast off?\u201d Too late Aidan recognized him as the yeoman with the shining bald head he\u2019d met in a tavern weeks ago. He was Fraser\u2019s man, and the one who\u2019d led Aidan to the merchant in the first place. \u201cI\u2019m looking for the Bishop,\u201d he added, hoping the casual use of Fraser\u2019s dockside identity would win him the information he wanted.</p><p>\u201cThe Bishop\u2019s off to Arbroath,\u201d the yeoman said, turning around. \u201cAnd what business is it of yours?\u201d He pinned Aidan with a squint. \u201cDo I know you?\u201d</p><p>Aidan felt bodies gathering behind him. He was grateful to sense Angus too, coming to stand at his shoulder.</p><p>Recognition dawned, and the yeoman\u2019s squint turned to a glare. \u201cI do know you. We was told to keep an eye out for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor me?\u201d Though Aidan pretended bemused innocence, his hand migrated closer to his sword hilt. How would Fraser know to look out for him?</p><p>\u201cAye, we was told a man would come round, chasing after Bishop\u2019s ship like a fox on a rabbit\u2019s tail. So, chasing the Bishop\u2019s rabbit, are ye?\u201d</p><p>The men behind him laughed, sidling closer.</p><p>There was no more pretending. Standing tall, Aidan wrapped his hand around his sword hilt, wondering what the farmer planned to do with a damned shepherd\u2019s crook and hoping it\u2019d be a better weapon than it looked. \u201cMaybe I am. Did he leave with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, \u2019twas his bride. And we was told to stop any who tried to interfere.\u201d The yeoman popped his knuckles. His fingers were fat, like sausages, to match his thick neck.</p><p>Aidan dared not glance back to determine how many stood behind them, but he estimated there were three additional men, at least. He could easily take down two, if nobody carried a musket. He hoped Angus could handle himself, relying on his brawn alone if that\u2019s what it took. He had no idea how the man fought, but Angus was a farmer, and Aidan had to assume he\u2019d no experience in a brawl.</p><p>But as Aidan was strategizing, damned if Angus didn\u2019t shock him by taking action, his face as stoic as ever.</p><p>The farmer snagged the yeoman\u2019s thick neck in his shepherd\u2019s crook and snapped it in, knocking the yeoman to his knees. Angus cracked him over the head, then blindly thrust back, jabbing a man behind him in the belly. He spun and jabbed again, getting the second man in the throat. A flurry of sure and rapid movements, and no more than five seconds later, Angus was standing over two downed men.</p><p>Aidan laughed, and the sound of it sent another, younger man running.</p><p>He and Angus joined back-to-back to face the other two men. \u201cWhere\u2019d you learn to fight like that, farmer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReaping oats is hard work.\u201d</p><p>Aidan chuckled. He was going to like having this Angus as a neighbor. \u201cSo I see.\u201d</p><p>Uncertainty was a needle in his heart. Would they be neighbors, or was he too late? Was Elspeth bound to another man already? The reminder of what was at stake focused him, and he and Angus easily dispatched the remaining two men.</p><p>Aidan\u2019s senses were attuned, and movement on the harbor above caught his eye. He strained, making out a familiar figure. The person seemed to want to move both briskly and unnoticed, which only served to make him all the more conspicuous.</p><p>\u201cI see him too,\u201d Angus said. Both men broke into an easy lope up the harbor, headed for Elspeth\u2019s father.</p><p>Aidan resheathed his sword. \u201cCurious, no?\u201d The old man looked back, and seeing that they followed, broke into a doddering run. \u201cAlmost like he feels guilty about something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll hear the man out before I jump to any conclusions,\u201d Angus said.</p><p>Aidan shot him a wry look. \u201cThat\u2019s right. Just an innocent farmer, you are.\u201d</p><p>They easily caught up to Farquharson, and Aidan hopped in front of him, barring his path. \u201cLeave something behind? Your daughter perhaps?\u201d</p><p>The old man\u2019s lip twitched. \u201cGive it up, boy. She\u2019s good as married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo a criminal,\u201d Aidan said.</p><p>\u201cTo a man of means.\u201d Elspeth\u2019s father spotted Angus and glanced nervously from him to Aidan. He took a step back, settling his sneer on Aidan. \u201cMy girl went on a grand ship, and without you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour girl was taken, and on the same tub that stole me as a child. Tell me, where\u2019s the honor in that?\u201d</p><p>Farquharson spat. \u201cWhat do you know of honor, slave boy?\u201d</p><p>Aidan felt a half smile curl his lips. The man could fling every insult imaginable, but he was impervious. \u201cI know Elspeth has more honor in her little finger than you ever will in your entire body.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cA lucky thing, that. Seeing as you did your all to sully her virtue. The girl\u2019s lucky Fraser took her\u2014\u201d</p><p>Aidan punched him. He stopped the man\u2019s words with his fist, marking the second time he\u2019d struck Elspeth\u2019s father. He\u2019d strike him again, and again if need be, if that was what it took to school him about his daughter\u2019s worth.</p><p>He shook out his fist. \u201cDon\u2019t you realize? You just sent Elspeth off with a pirate, a kidnapper. I know the Endeavor well. Pray your daughter isn\u2019t shackled as I was on my introductory voyage.\u201d</p> <p>Something flashed in her father\u2019s eyes. Aidan hoped it was a flicker of humanity finally dawning.</p><p>Aidan offered his hand, pulling Farquharson to standing. Keeping his voice calm and slow, he asked, \u201cWhere did he take her?\u201d</p><p>The old man didn\u2019t answer, and Angus stepped forward, until the two of them loomed tall over him. It seemed Elspeth\u2019s father was trying the farmer\u2019s patience too.</p><p>\u201cTell me, old man,\u201d Aidan demanded. \u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>Farquharson shook his head in defeat. \u201cTo his estate in Arbroath. They\u2019ll be wed by nightfall.\u201d Then he pursed his lips, looking away into the distance.</p> <p>Aidan hoped her father was praying for forgiveness. Because at that moment, forgiveness wasn\u2019t something Aidan had in his heart to give. \u201cThe man you chose for your daughter could as easily hang from a gibbet as make his fortune.\u201d He turned to Angus. \u201cYou see this one home, before he does any more damage.\u201d</p><p>Aidan strode away, headed north up the harbor, to where he\u2019d docked his sloop.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Farquharson shouted after him.</p><p>\u201cTo stop a wedding.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 34</p><p>The reality of Elspeth\u2019s situation was upon her. Traveling by boat was a horrid affair, nothing like what she\u2019d experienced with Aidan on his sloop.</p> <p>At least the mystery of the man with the black pearl was finally solved. She stared at Captain Will. She\u2019d expected the most fearsome of pirates, but he was average. Neither tall nor short. Not particularly hideous, nor was he so very well formed. The only thing that stood out was the black pearl dangling from his right ear.</p><p>And somehow it was this lack of exceptionality that was the root of his menace. His eyes were cold but his smile came easy, and she had the disturbing sensation that a horrible secret lay cloaked behind that placid mien. If she found him so unsettling, what must a young boy like Aidan have felt?</p><p>A howl echoed from the ship\u2019s hold, and she flinched. Even seated in the captain\u2019s quarters, she smelled the Endeavor\u2019s stink of pitch and mildew, and the cries of men locked below carried clearly to her ears, making her blood run cold.</p><p>Even more chilling was the knowledge that she was traveling on the very ship that\u2019d stolen Aidan away, so many years ago.</p><p>Aidan. He\u2019d come for her. She knew it. He\u2019d arrive, greater than any hero from any book. Sailing alongside, he\u2019d toss grappling hooks into their rigging and swoop on deck like the most fearsome of Barbadian raiders. He\u2019d create choices where there were none, revealing some pirate treasure he\u2019d buried away.</p><p>Captain Will had been staring at her and apparently saw something in her expression that he found distasteful.</p><p>\u201cDamnable situation,\u201d the captain muttered. He stood and closed the distance to where Fraser sat. He approached too closely, towering over the merchant, forcing him to crane his neck upward. \u201cYou\u2019ll pay for this little detour. I\u2019m not in business to take you out for a honeymoon sail.\u201d He cast a thoughtful look at Fraser\u2019s heavy suitcase, stroking the pearl in his ear all the while. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t like having a woman aboard. The men fear naught but ill fortune can come of it.\u201d</p><p>Fraser leaned back, affecting amiability. \u201cNot superstitious, are you?\u201d</p> <p>The captain glared, freezing Fraser\u2019s easy laugh in his throat.</p><p>Elspeth watched the captain carefully. The way he tightened his jaw ever so slightly, set his shoulders ever so stiffly, showed him in a new light. She\u2019d wager he was superstitious indeed. Very much so.</p><p>\u201cNo good comes of a woman on board.\u201d Again, he absentmindedly rubbed his earring, and she wondered if the strange trinket weren\u2019t actually some sort of talisman. His good-luck charm. \u201cAnd it\u2019s Friday. One never begins a voyage on a Friday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re almost there, and no evil has come to pass,\u201d Fraser assured him. \u201cYour superstitions are for naught. Such are merely the misguided notions of fishwives and aging sailors.\u201d</p><p>Will\u2019s expression cleared, and though he once again made himself unreadable, Elspeth fancied it was only a ruse. He gave a cool nod. \u201cAs you say. You are the man with the money, are you not?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t believe his acquiescence for one moment and studied him, looking for more clues. He was well kempt, but not a dandy, and she imagined that his innocuous mask made it as easy for him to wend his way through the wealthiest drawing rooms as to skulk into the grittiest of dockside pubs.</p><p>\u201cYou stare,\u201d he said, walking toward her.</p><p>She startled, caught in the act, and quickly looked away. \u201cDo I?\u201d She had the wild hope that some shipboard emergency might call him back above deck. He might appear utterly average, but she was more afraid of him than of any man she\u2019d ever met. \u201cI apologize.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need for apology, I assure you. But I wonder. Is it that I\u2019ve caught your fancy?\u201d He took her chin in his fingers, tilting her face to the light. It had the effect of illuminating him too, highlighting a clean overcoat of decent fabric and a full head of combed but graying hair. \u201cFor I find you\u2019ve caught mine.\u201d</p><p>He grew silent, studying her. \u201cHow unusual\u2014you\u2019ve yellow in your eyes. But of course you already knew that.\u201d Their eyes connected, and gooseflesh crawled across her skin. He seemed to look deeply into her soul. \u201cYellow eyes ... I wonder, what could that augur?\u201d</p><p>So he was superstitious. She prayed that yellow eyes signaled something lucky, because she didn\u2019t want to find herself walking the plank. Her eyes flashed again to the pearl in his ear. She imagined he\u2019d be lost without it.</p><p>He smiled, and for an instant, he looked no more menacing than a benign uncle. But then his eyes went flat, like a snake\u2019s. \u201cPity you\u2019re to be wed to my partner.\u201d He raised a brow. \u201cUnless you\u2019d change your mind?\u201d</p><p>She gave a shy shake to her head. Captain Will was infinitely more frightening than Fraser ever could be.</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cNot interested in becoming a pirate bride?\u201d</p><p>Just not your pirate bride. For once, she had the words ready on her tongue, but chose not to speak them.</p><p>But then a wild notion struck her. Her gaze skittered over that shining pearl, and she gave a coy shrug.</p><p>\u201cCould it be? Our maiden is uncertain?\u201d The captain leaned closer, his eyes locked with hers. \u201cYellow,\u201d he murmured, the whispered word hot on her mouth. \u201cPerhaps for the blue and yellow of fair skies ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d Fraser sputtered. She felt his presence from across the room, vibrating with anger.</p><p>Captain Will smiled. \u201cThis is your bride having second thoughts.\u201d</p><p>Time seemed to stop as she summoned every last shred of her courage. Holding her breath, she reached a tentative hand out. Her heart thudded so, she thought surely he\u2019d be able to spy the pulse in her neck. She grazed a finger along the captain\u2019s cheek, and then touched him again with her whole hand. She stroked his face, keeping her eyes wide on his so he might not forget their strange yellow flecks.</p><p>Her fingers were close, so close. She would be courageous. She\u2019d strike at the very heart of the evil pirate. She raked her hands through his hair. He chuckled, a husky sound, so she dared it again. And this time she lingered over his ears. She stroked some more, and with each pass, grazed his black pearl. \u201cMy da always said sunlight followed in my wake.\u201d</p><p>She was close to her goal, but needed to push herself further, to leap from the precipice. She parted her lips on a sigh, and his mouth closed in. His teeth knocked into hers, and she clamped her eyes shut tight, fighting the urge to shudder with revulsion.</p><p>Feigning passion, she made herself return the kiss, writhing in his arms, all the while raking her fingers through his hair, stroking his cheeks.</p><p>A commotion on deck distracted him. He pulled away, and she refrained from smearing the back of her hand along her mouth. \u201cYou\u2019re a peculiar wee minx,\u201d he said, cupping her jaw. \u201cThey say women aboard ship are bad luck, unless naked. What say you, minx? Are you ready to be naked? Because I think I might like to keep you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I might not let you.\u201d She\u2019d tried to adopt a saucy tone, but her voice trembled, and she hoped he\u2019d take it for excitement, not fear. For in her palm was nestled a single, black pearl.</p><p>Barking a laugh, he pushed her chin from his hand.</p><p>Men shouted on deck\u2014words sounding like \u201cland, ho!\u201d\u2014and Captain Will went to peer out the porthole.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll excuse me,\u201d he said. Giving her a regal bow, he added, \u201cI regret I\u2019ll not have more time to convince you. I didn\u2019t believe Fraser when he told me. But I see now, it is the still waters which flow the deepest.\u201d</p><p>As he left, Elspeth\u2019s chest shuddered with a quiet sigh of relief.</p><p>Fraser glared at her, clearly uncertain what to make of her little scene with the captain, and then he rose to peer out the porthole for himself. \u201cI see by your salacious behavior that you\u2019re familiar with a man\u2019s touch.\u201d He kept his back to her as he spoke, staring out at the water. \u201cI\u2019ve not asked where you spent last night\u2014I thought I\u2019d spare you the discomfort. For now. Your paramour\u2019s identity will be discovered in time.\u201d</p><p>He stepped aside, pinning her with a flat stare, but all she saw was the hazy silhouette of land in the distance.</p><p>They were about to dock in Arbroath, and yet there was still no sign of Aidan. No grappling hooks, no shots off the starboard bow.</p><p>Where was he? She was spinning a wild tale, casting herself as heroine, and needed her hero now more than ever. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>What if he thought she wanted this wedding? Even she\u2019d convinced herself that marrying Fraser was her only option, that he\u2019d provide financial salvation for her and her father, saving them from the poorhouse.</p><p>Even so, Aidan would still come for her. He\u2019d sweep her into his arms, and steal her away, telling her with a kiss that she belonged to none but him.</p><p>But they disembarked, and they were whisked into a carriage, and they were taken to Fraser\u2019s property, yet there was no Aidan.</p> <p>\u201cThe minister will be here soon,\u201d Fraser said. He\u2019d set her up in a dismal salon in his so-called grand Arbroath estate, which was naught but a dank, drafty seaside manor.</p><p>She pulled her arisaid tight around her shoulders. \u201cYou\u2019ve never seen reason to take a bride before. Of all women, why me?\u201d</p><p>He gave her an oily smile. \u201cYou\u2019ve the mind of a man, but the body of a woman.\u201d</p><p>She recoiled. \u201cYou don\u2019t seem to think much of the female sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen the need for a wife before, no. But despite your plain ways, you strike me as brighter than the others. Over time, you\u2019ll come to see how like-minded we are.\u201d His gaze slithered down her body, then back up again. \u201cI imagine we\u2019ll be well matched in other ways too.\u201d</p> <p>She\u2019d agreed to this union to save herself and her father from the poorhouse. But surely there was no worse fate than the one she faced now. \u201cDo you expect me to take your words for a compliment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, and to be grateful for it.\u201d</p><p>She no longer took pains to hide her disgust. She\u2019d spent a lifetime being grateful for scraps, now she was expected to be thankful for casual indignities as well? This man was a louse, a scoundrel. She\u2019d not marry him, even if it meant she\u2019d have to end her days as a charwoman on a faraway plantation.</p><p>She needed Aidan. Surely he\u2019d come to stop this madness, to save her. She only hoped he\u2019d forgive her. What she\u2019d done was dreadful. In thinking this union was the only way to get free of debt, she\u2019d sold Aidan short. Because they could figure anything out, if only they were together.</p><p>But her life would end the moment the minister arrived. He would perform the ceremony, even though the banns hadn\u2019t been proclaimed. And then she\u2019d be wed for good.</p><p>She\u2019d not make a second mistake\u2014she wouldn\u2019t let it happen. She\u2019d trust Aidan was coming for her, and she\u2019d hold on until he did. She\u2019d be a worthy pirate bride and help save herself.</p> <p>Stall him. She racked her brain for an excuse to keep Fraser talking. \u201cWhat if I\u2019ve changed my mind? What if I don\u2019t want to marry you after all?\u201d</p><p>Fraser laughed. Looking bored, he stood to take a turn around the room. \u201cYou\u2019ve no choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I do?\u201d As long as Aidan was alive, she had a choice. They could sail away, live off the fruits of the sea, docking in uninhabited isles and charmingly exotic ports.</p><p>\u201cAre you thinking of someone else?\u201d He stopped his pacing to give her a pointed look. \u201cI assure you, I am the only man with means enough to save your family.\u201d</p><p>Fraser spoke the truth, and she hated him for it. In destroying her home, he\u2019d taken her options. He stepped closer, putting words to her thoughts. \u201cOnly through our marriage will your father be spared the poorhouse.\u201d</p><p>She shot upright in her seat. \u201cA poorhouse you put him in yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA man does as he must,\u201d he said with a rueful shrug. \u201cBut now I am ready to pull you from the ashes, as it were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes as he must?\u201d Her eyes widened. \u201cSo you confess it? You set the fire?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI am capable of many things. Think of it as a lesson. And I\u2019ve another one to teach you tonight, after we\u2019re wed.\u201d Fraser stroked a finger down her cheek.</p><p>She shuddered and looked away, unable to bear the sight of him.</p><p>He thought she had no choice, but she did, and she would make it. The greatest of heroines endured tragedy and overcame. And so would she.</p><p>\u201cThinking of our wedding night?\u201d</p><p>Standing, she strode around him to the window. \u201cYou could say that.\u201d</p><p>Keeping her back to him, she dug her fingers down the front of her bodice, tying a few extra knots into her laces. And a little insurance never hurt.</p><p>He came to stand at her back, and she gripped the sill, staring blindly out the window. He traced a finger down her spine, making her flesh crawl. \u201cYou must relax yourself, settle into the notion. I always get what I want, Elspeth.\u201d</p><p>Not everything he wanted. Not this time.</p><p>Her eyes snapped into focus. There was a boat on the horizon. Could it be Aidan? She just needed to hold on.</p><p>A bell rang on the floor below, and voices carried up to them.</p><p>\u201cThe minister,\u201d he said with a smile. Fraser proffered his arm. \u201cAre you ready to become the Lady Fraser?\u201d</p><p>Her heart thundered in her chest. The moment was upon her. She strained, looking back out the window, but saw nothing but a white-and-gray haze.</p><p>What if that were Aidan, coming for her on his sloop? She needed to wait for him. Needed to delay, for him.</p><p>She sidled away from Fraser. \u201cYou won\u2019t get everything you want, you know.\u201d</p><p>His expression narrowed. \u201cAnd what is it I\u2019m to be denied, Elspeth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy maidenhead.\u201d She swooped behind an armchair, bracing herself on its back as if it might guard her. \u201cI\u2019m no longer a virgin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019ve gathered.\u201d He shook his head, looking amused. \u201cI\u2019m no fool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven now, I might carry his child.\u201d</p><p>Anger hardened his features. He stalked toward her. \u201cThen we\u2019ll find a way to slip the babe.\u201d</p><p>She dashed to the door, leaping for the knob. \u201cI\u2019ll escape.\u201d</p><p>He cut her off, slamming and bolting it shut. \u201cDo I need to teach you your lesson before we\u2019re wed? I can be quite an unforgiving teacher, ready to school you all the day long.\u201d</p><p>A gunshot rang out. Aidan. It had to be him. He\u2019d arrived. He was coming for her.</p><p>She heard voices raised in the hallway. She hadn\u2019t been the only one to hear the shot.</p><p>\u201cYou think he\u2019s coming, don\u2019t you?\u201d Fraser prowled closer, reaching out to grab her arm. \u201cBut he can\u2019t save you now.\u201d</p><p>She ran to the hearth, but the only tool at hand was a bellows. She snatched it up, holding it before her like a shield. \u201cI\u2019ll fight you.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cLittle fool. The time has come. There\u2019s no avoiding it.\u201d</p><p>She felt like a caged animal. Her eyes flicked to the locked door. \u201cThe moment you open those doors, I\u2019ll run.\u201d</p><p>Slowly, he began to remove his overcoat. \u201cThen I\u2019ll simply have to restrain you,\u201d he said, his voice gone steely. \u201cI\u2019d feared this, and so borrowed a little something from our good captain.\u201d</p><p>He picked up the heavy suitcase he\u2019d been carrying and opened it. Dull metal glimmered within.</p><p>Shackles? \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I do is up to you. Will you succumb willingly, or must I bind you to make you say the words I do?\u201d</p><p>There was another gunshot. The voices in the hallway grew louder. Someone jiggled the doorknob. Fraser glanced from his suitcase to the door, weighing his next move.</p><p>Her body trembled with desperate energy. There was nothing left to her but extreme measures. It seemed Fraser wanted her to bow to him, so bow she must.</p><p>She let the bellows slip from her fingers and fluttered a hand over her brow as she slumped against the back of the sofa. Inhaling deeply, she lent a dramatic quaver to her voice. \u201cYou win. I shall yield.\u201d</p><p>Growing eerily still, Fraser gaped at her, looking as though he didn\u2019t trust his ears. \u201cYou surrender to me?\u201d</p><p>Her face flushed hot. Never. But she had a charade to maintain, and so forced herself to speak the words. \u201cYes, you may begin your ... lesson, if you must.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 35</p><p>Aidan steered into Arbroath harbor, and though it was far smaller than Aberdeen\u2019s, navigating the waterway was simple. Since it was not nearly as thriving a port, dockage was easily had\u2014found just next to a ship he\u2019d recognize better than his own face in the mirror.</p><p>The Endeavor.</p><p>He tied up his sloop, feeling eyes upon him. Rather than glance up, he prolonged the moment, letting the gaze bore into him, steadily going about his work. Because he knew whom he\u2019d find when he looked up.</p><p>He\u2019d felt the gaze as a child, and recognized its stillness now. Dead eyes that\u2019d bored into him, raking his soul. But now he was a man, and he knew who he was and what he was about.</p><p>Aidan glanced up, finally, his work finished. The man with the black pearl stood at the bow of his ship, docked not twenty feet away, silent as a sphinx and just as unreadable. They stared at each other.</p><p>It was his one chance. Captain Will\u2019s crew bustled about, readying to cast off. Aidan needed to kill his enemy now\u2014it was what he\u2019d dreamed of doing for most his life. He could lure him away, take him in a sword fight. Aidan had spent the past thirteen years growing bigger, stronger, faster\u2014he knew he\u2019d best the man. Or he could watch him sail away forever, bound for God knew where, never to be seen again.</p><p>He could kill his enemy, or he could have Elspeth.</p><p>He waited to feel the familiar thirst for vengeance, but found the rage had burned through him. All he wanted now was his Beth.</p><p>His choice was clear. Exhilaratingly simple. He\u2019d regret not killing his enemy. But even more would he regret losing her. There was only one thing for him to do. He needed to stop her wedding, before it was too late.</p><p>Because he refused to lose her.</p><p>Captain Will touched a finger to his head in a mockery of a salute. Only then did their gazes unlock.</p><p>Aidan jogged up the harbor, scanning for a likely source of information. He needed to find Fraser\u2019s home, and quickly. It was while a dock rat was pointing him in the right direction that he sensed the Endeavor get under way at his back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just have to avenge you in hell,\u201d he murmured, and then raced to find Elspeth. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Fraser leaped for her like a starving man spotting a heel of bread.</p><p>\u201cSo eager you are.\u201d She slipped from under his grasp, darting to the window. She stole a peek through the glass, but the ship had sailed past, and though Fraser\u2019s house fronted the sea, the view didn\u2019t encompass the harbor.</p><p>She prayed Aidan was out there. She\u2019d brought this on herself, and regretted it deeply. Why hadn\u2019t she waited for him? He\u2019d have helped her find a way clear of her problems without having to marry Fraser.</p> <p>\u201cIf I didn\u2019t know better, I\u2019d say you were watching for someone.\u201d He approached her from behind, spinning her roughly to face him. \u201cBut it\u2019s time to attend to me.\u201d</p><p>She sputtered, struggling to formulate yet another excuse. Where was Aidan? In her mind, she urged him to come faster. She was running out of ruses, and didn\u2019t know how much longer she could put Fraser off. As it was, her skin crawled and her stomach lurched to be in such close contact. \u201cNo ... I ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember, Elspeth. Will you come to me willingly?\u201d He nodded to his leather satchel, lying open on the floor, revealing the dull metal cuffs. \u201cOr must I make you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am willing, of course, sir.\u201d She held her chin high, as though naught were amiss. \u201cBut I find\u201d\u2014once more she slid from his clutches\u2014\u201cyou move much too quickly.\u201d</p><p>He raked an impatient hand through his hair, leaving him looking like an aging madman. \u201cWhat\u2019s the delay?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo delay.\u201d She watched as his eyes narrowed in suspicion, and quickly added, \u201cIt\u2019s simply that a woman likes her man ... to take his time about it.\u201d She swallowed hard, feeling revulsion at her own words.</p><p>\u201cTake my time?\u201d He snatched her back, his fingers curling painfully into her arms. \u201cYou\u2019ve made me wait long enough.\u201d</p><p>He dove in to kiss her, but she tipped her chin at the last moment, and his mouth landed on her jaw. Undaunted, he ravaged her neck instead, then, kissing lower, he brought a hand to her breast, cupping her roughly.</p><p>He lifted his head to tug at her bodice, and soon discovered the laces were tightly knotted. He pawed and fumbled, demanding, \u201cWhat have you done? You wretched girl.\u201d</p><p>She tried to duck away, but this time he wouldn\u2019t let her go. Panic consumed her. Never had it dawned on her how weak she really was. He was too strong\u2014she couldn\u2019t get away.</p><p>Taking both hands to her bodice, he tugged hard, and the front of it began to rip apart. She used the opportunity to wriggle free, and ran to the hearth.</p> <p>He stalked after her. \u201cYou postpone the inevitable, girl.\u201d</p><p>Her heart was exploding in her chest. She couldn\u2019t dash about all night\u2014he\u2019d eventually catch her. And what would happen then?</p><p>No, Aidan would come. She knew it. She just needed to keep her wits about her until then. Fight until then.</p><p>\u201cInevitable perhaps.\u201d She hopped behind a sofa, putting it between them, and nodded to the window at his back. She forced a coy smile, and it felt like a rictus on her face. \u201cBut must we proceed before an open window?\u201d</p><p>She could tell by his shifting expression that this mollified him. But there was only so much more stalling she could do before she\u2019d be unable to stop him. He was a man, and just too strong.</p><p>\u201cThen I shall take you on the settee,\u201d he said.</p><p>She pulled her hands from its upholstered back as though they\u2019d been burned. She was light-headed, now, her breath coming in frantic pants.</p><p>How would an epic heroine act? What would a heroine do? Calm. Her thoughts had grown hysterical, and she forced her mind to calm. Surely, there was a way to overcome. Surely there was a story like this one, a tale of weak triumphing over strong. Like David and Goliath. Or ...</p> <p>Her eyes went bright, flicking from settee to side table. And the fat candlestick burning there.</p><p>Like David and Goliath. Or Odysseus and Polyphemus. She looked back at the candle, her mind spinning furiously. Odysseus had blinded the giant Cyclops with a flaming stick. She swallowed hard, flexing her hands. She was no Greek hero, but the candle burned brightly, with a thick puddle of hot wax beneath the wick.</p><p>Fraser edged around the couch, closing in. But this time, instead of dashing away, she stood her ground.</p><p>He jumped for her, and she braced her legs against the back of the sofa, leaning and snatching the candlestick. Molten wax splashed on her thumb, and it burned her, focused her.</p><p>She swung for his face. The flame shrank but it didn\u2019t go out, making a whip-whip sound like a candle in the wind.</p><p>She connected, stabbing him in the eye, and he screamed. Hunching into himself, he staggered backward, clutching his face in his hands.</p><p>She sprang back, shocked by the contact. Terrified he\u2019d recover, she flung away the candle and grabbed the bellows. She dove for him, swinging it with both hands, slamming the back of his head, a hollow wooden blow that knocked him to the floor.</p><p>She stood over his limp body, breathing hard, her heart kicking furiously against her chest. She had overcome him.</p><p>There was a loud commotion in the hallway, and her eyes flew to the door. She still gripped the bellows in both hands, as though poised for battle. She heard a man\u2019s step, flying up the stairs, and then there was pounding at the door.</p><p>\u201cBeth, Beth! Are you in there?\u201d</p><p>Aidan.</p><p>She raced to unbolt the lock, and Aidan burst into the room. He stood there, sword extended, looking ready to storm the gates of hell. In a split second, his eyes went from her to Fraser\u2019s limp body and back again, a broad smile splitting his face. \u201cI told them naught can slip by my Beth.\u201d</p><p>Relief flooded her, crumpling her legs, and he caught her, snatching her in his arms. He pulled back to kiss her hard, and then clutched her even closer, running his hands along her body, as though to reassure himself that she was safe.</p><p>He was there, and she was safe, and suddenly she trembled so violently, feeling cold, like all the blood had drained from her body. She wrapped her arms tightly around him, clinging to his chest. \u201cWhat took you so long?\u201d</p><p>He laughed and tilted her chin up to face him. \u201cMe? Could you not have waited for me? Just an hour, Beth?\u201d</p><p>It seemed an easy thing, now, to have waited for Aidan. But she\u2019d been so distraught by the scene at her farm, so frightened.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I ... I didn\u2019t know what to do. My father had me so confused.\u201d Her foolishness had almost ruined everything. She should\u2019ve trusted that Aidan could take care of things. She should\u2019ve stood up to her father. \u201cI thought if I didn\u2019t marry him, he might come after you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re only allowed to marry one man, and that\u2019s me.\u201d He shot a disdainful look at Fraser lying in a heap on the floor. \u201cAnd besides, you thought I couldn\u2019t stand up to that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has all the dock men in his pocket, and so much wealth, and, well ...\u201d She slumped against him. \u201cI just always make such a mess of things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMess? I don\u2019t know about any mess.\u201d He cupped her chin, sweeping his thumb along her cheek. \u201cI will grant you one thing. You appear to have made a mess of me.\u201d</p><p>He leaned down for a kiss. It was slow and gentle, spreading warmth in a gentle pulse through her body. With Aidan holding her, no longer was she shaking and cold. She felt instinctively that everything would work out\u2014the farm, her father, all would be sorted to rights. She wrapped her hand around the strong column of his neck, feeling how safe, how right it was to have her pirate rogue by her side.</p><p>Her muscles seized. She pulled away on a gasp, remembering. \u201cBut what of your pirate with the black pearl? I met him\u2014he was docked here. Did you see him, get him?\u201d</p><p>He gave a rueful shrug. \u201cIt was you or him, Beth. I chose you.\u201d</p><p>She pushed away, not believing her ears. \u201cBut you\u2019ve always dreamed of besting him, of having your revenge.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed her, pulling her close with a light thump against his chest. \u201cDon\u2019t you see how happy you\u2019ve made me? No, Captain Will shall live to see another day, and I\u2019ve made my peace with it. You see, I had a wedding to stop.\u201d He kissed her gently on the forehead, and with a wink, added, \u201cAnd now I\u2019ve one to attend.\u201d</p><p>He glanced toward the door, but none of the servants were brave enough to show their faces. With a squeeze he let her go. \u201cI hear there\u2019s a minister about. We need to fetch him. There\u2019s only going to be one marriage today and it\u2019ll be yours and mine.\u201d</p><p>She grabbed his arm to stop him, and he paused, looking down at her, his brow raised in question.</p><p>\u201cI have a wedding gift for you first.\u201d She rustled through her skirts, then proffered her open hand, where a luminous black pearl lay nestled in her palm.</p><p>He gave her a puzzled look, then touched it with a tentative fingertip. \u201cI don\u2019t understand. Is it ... ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said proudly, pursing her lips so as not to smile too widely. \u201cI pried it from his ear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did no such thing!\u201d He laughed and shook his head. \u201cTruly? You just ... took it? How?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was forced to kiss him, but it was not,\u201d she interjected quickly, seeing the rage cloud his face, \u201cnot so very long a kiss. And it was in front of Fraser.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm-hm.\u201d He nodded, seeming unsure what to make of it.</p><p>\u201cIt was an old thing, you see. And ill made. It slid easily from his ear.\u201d</p><p>Awe replaced the anger in his eyes. \u201cYou clever girl.\u201d</p><p>She gave a shy shrug, even though his words made her proud beyond reckoning. She held the pearl up to the window to study it. It was shiny and irregularly shaped, with a greenish cast in the light. \u201cHe seems a superstitious sort. He kept rubbing it, which led me to think ... I believe he thought this held off evil spirits. A talisman of sorts.\u201d</p><p>Aidan laughed hard then, alternately clutching her close and pushing apart to admire the pearl. The noise roused Fraser, who was beginning to stir and moan on the floor.</p><p>Aidan wrapped his broad hand around hers, closing it in a fist around the pearl. He nodded to the merchant. \u201cWe need to tie up that one.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI know just the thing,\u201d she said brightly, heading straight for Fraser\u2019s suitcase and his grim cargo. She pulled out a pair of steel cuffs, dangling them. \u201cShall we throw away the key?\u201d</p><p>He laughed again. \u201cYou\u2019re full of surprises. I only regret that the Endeavor has left port.\u201d He knelt to shackle Fraser\u2019s hands. \u201cI\u2019ve half a mind to put this one in the hold so he can spend the rest of his days laboring on some other man\u2019s plantation.\u201d</p><p>She sighed, regretful of one thing. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you couldn\u2019t get Captain Will.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll get your chance,\u201d a voice announced from the doorway.</p><p>She startled, but Aidan only froze, as though turned to stone. Standing in the doorway was the man with the black pearl, and he was seething.</p><p>Above that normal body, those normal clothes, his face was distorted into a mask of rage. Elspeth\u2019s eyes were drawn downward, and her flesh crawled to see the weapon dangling from his hand. He held a large ax\u2014a sailor\u2019s boarding ax\u2014its flat head tapering into a lethally sharp spike. She knew such a thing was used as both tool and weapon, to hack through rigging, to hook and drag timber across deck, to climb and board another ship. And, of course, to slaughter men.</p><p>\u201cSo happy you could join us,\u201d Aidan said. He rose, unsheathing his sword. \u201cI\u2019ve been dreaming of this for thirteen long years.\u201d</p><p>But the captain ignored him, glaring only at Elspeth. \u201cI believe you took something of mine. I\u2019ll not leave without it.\u201d He strolled toward her, swinging that gruesome weapon. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve had second thoughts. I think I might take you with me after all.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d Aidan stepped in front of her. \u201cYou won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>The captain peered at him, as though seeing him for the first time. His lips peeled into a slow smile. \u201cI see the little chimney rat has grown up.\u201d He scanned up and down Aidan\u2019s body, sneering at the sword in his hand. \u201cYou overreach, boy.\u201d</p><p>With a feral growl, Aidan attacked, slashing his sword down hard, but the captain grabbed his ax in both hands\u2014one gripping the base, one the head\u2014stopping the blade with its handle.</p><p>Aidan pressed forward, feinting and thrusting. \u201cAnd you\u2019re overmatched,\u201d he said, slashing diagonally again and again.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t beat me, chimney boy.\u201d The captain bobbed back, blocking the onslaught with the handle of his weapon. \u201cYou\u2019re naught but chattel to sell at market.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re naught but an aging cur.\u201d Aidan had him pinned in the corner, and Elspeth inched as close as possible to watch.</p> <p>\u201cWell suited, we are. Both men without homes.\u201d The captain edged along the wall, and spun free of the trap. Suddenly it was Aidan who found himself in the corner, his sword useless at so close a range. \u201cThe difference is, you\u2019re a man without options.\u201d</p><p>Elspeth gasped then clamped her hand over her mouth. She dared not create a distraction. Her eyes flitted across the room, looking for some weapon, some way to help. Her head buzzed with energy, her body quivering with the need to act.</p><p>The captain switched his ax to one hand and hauled back for the kill. \u201cBut now it\u2019s time for you to die.\u201d</p><p>Captain Will swung, and though the ax was lethal, it was clumsy, too, and Aidan managed to duck out of its path. The captain swung again, and again Aidan managed to dodge him.</p><p>But with no shield for blocking, Aidan would soon tire of hopping to and fro. Soon the blow would come that he\u2019d be unable to evade.</p><p>She scanned the room again, and this time her eyes lit on the bellows. Not a shield, but better than nothing. \u201cHere,\u201d she called, tossing it to him.</p><p>The captain laughed, swatting the ax leisurely in the flat of his palm. \u201cA bellows? Think you to gust and puff me to death?\u201d Face freezing into a grimace, he exploded to action, and this time when he swung, the bellows stopped his blow.</p><p>\u201cTo death? You misunderstand me.\u201d Aidan pried his impromptu shield free and darted around the captain. A quick glance showed that though it was edged in metal, the bellows had been hacked halfway through. \u201cI won\u2019t kill you. I\u2019ll see you suffer as I have.\u201d</p> <p>Aidan prowled toward the captain, a cold smile on his face, and at the last minute, threw the bellows at him. The pirate was momentarily distracted, and Aidan slashed his sword deeply across the man\u2019s torso.</p><p>Captain Will looked in disbelieving horror at his belly.</p><p>\u201cGutted like a fish,\u201d he said with eerie calm. He raised his ax to strike, but his swing was awkward.</p><p>Aidan blocked, then knocked the ax from the pirate\u2019s hand. He shoved the man to his knees. \u201cAnd caught like one.\u201d</p><p>Aidan glanced at Fraser\u2019s suitcase, and Elspeth understood at once. She retrieved a second pair of shackles, this one more elaborate, with four cuffs connected by long lengths of chain suited for hands and feet. \u201cBut don\u2019t you want to kill him?\u201d she asked quietly.</p><p>\u201cAnd spare others the pleasure of watching him swing from the gallows?\u201d He used the butt of his sword to knock the man onto his haunches. \u201cNor would I rob him of the many pleasures he has in store. First, I\u2019m going to sell that pretty pearl, and rather than use it to pay for his burial, I\u2019ve a mind to split the money among the men in his hold.\u201d</p><p>The captain\u2019s head was lolling now, and he looked ready to topple.</p><p>Aidan clicked the first metal cuff around the man\u2019s wrist. \u201cExtra tight, aye? Don\u2019t fret\u2014the bleeding will stop in a few weeks\u2019 time, and the skin will toughen nicely. Trust me. Eventually, you won\u2019t feel pain through the scars. If you evade the noose for that long.\u201d</p><p>As Aidan opened the second cuff, Captain Will sprang up.</p><p>Elspeth shrieked.</p><p>Despite his bloody belly, there was fire in the captain\u2019s eyes, and he leaped onto Aidan, winding the metal chain about his neck. \u201cI\u2019ll teach you pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve already taught me.\u201d He kneed the pirate in the gut, and his breeches came back bloodied. \u201cIt\u2019s a lesson I\u2019ve mastered,\u201d he managed to say through gritted teeth.</p><p>Aidan kneed again, and again, but the man remained standing, his face flushed crimson with the effort of keeping the chain coiled tightly around Aidan\u2019s neck.</p><p>Elspeth watched in horror as the captain merely stood there, clinging to the chain, refusing to fall. Aidan\u2019s lips were a ghastly shade of blue, his skin mottled white and red. There was something strange about his body, and she realized he wasn\u2019t breathing.</p><p>Fight. She willed him to fight, and knew she needed to fight too. She ran for the damaged bellows, but Aidan took action before she could.</p><p>He butted his head forward, slamming his forehead into the pirate\u2019s nose. The man\u2019s grip on the chain slackened, and Aidan pounced toward him. He snatched the captain\u2019s head at the jaw and forehead, and with a quick yank, snapped his neck. Captain Will\u2019s body crashed to the floor, its deadweight making an ungainly, thundering sound, like firewood tumbling from a stack.</p><p>Aidan unwound the chain from his throat, coughing and gasping for air. He nudged the man\u2019s body with his foot. \u201cI\u2019ve mastered the lesson, but now it\u2019s time for me to move on.\u201d</p><p>His eyes sought hers, and seeing Elspeth\u2019s trauma, he ran to her, cradling her in his arms. He swallowed hard, and it looked painful. \u201cI\u2019m all right. I\u2019ve suffered far worse.\u201d</p><p>She chafed freezing hands along his arms. \u201cYou must lie down,\u201d she insisted, tugging him to the settee.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do no such thing.\u201d His hoarse chuckle turned into another round of coughing. \u201cI told you, luvvie, the only place I\u2019m going is to fetch the minister.\u201d</p><p>He spun her to face him, his eyes glittering with intensity. \u201cYour father can hunt me, he can challenge me all he dares. But I will claim you, Beth. I\u2019ve voice enough to speak vows, and I will wed you before the sun goes down.\u201d</p><p>The words were more exhilarating than any she could\u2019ve imagined from any storybook. His eyes sparked with intent, his desire only for her. All she could do was manage a nod in answer.</p><p>He swept her into his arms, pulling her from her feet in a kiss. She tasted salt on his lips, and for a moment, she was his pirate bride, and the sea their kingdom.</p><p>Too soon he pulled from her. \u201cI will make you mine. But first, I must go and do one more thing.\u201d</p><p>She knew instantly what he was about. \u201cYou\u2019re going to free the slaves.\u201d At his nod, she told him, \u201cI\u2019m coming with you. We\u2019ll do it together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hoped you\u2019d say that,\u201d he said, taking her hand in his. His grip was warm and sure.</p><p>She began to speak. \u201cBecause from now on\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe do everything together,\u201d Aidan said, completing her thought as surely as he\u2019d completed her.</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>Aidan sat with Elspeth, nestled cozily on a bed of hay, in the makeshift barn Angus had helped him build.</p><p>Elspeth. His wife.</p><p>When he returned from the Indies, he thought he\u2019d suffered all a man could suffer. Had lost all there was a man could lose. Until he\u2019d met and almost lost her.</p><p>She held a baby lamb in her lap, carefully clearing the animal\u2019s eyes. \u201cIt seems a peculiar flaw to be born with one\u2019s eyelashes poking into one\u2019s eyes.\u201d</p><p>The creatures were tiny and helpless, but like many lambs, they\u2019d been born with their lashes in their eyes. And, piteous as it was, Aidan adored watching her care for them.</p><p>He brushed a hand along its downy white wool. \u201cThey don\u2019t seem to suffer for it. And besides, what creature wouldn\u2019t want your kindly ministrations?\u201d</p><p>Elspeth looked up at him with a smile. She\u2019d donned her spectacles, and they were slipping down the bridge of her nose. The sight of her rumpled and bookish appearance stabbed his heart through with tenderness.</p><p>He gently pushed her glasses up for her and cleared the hair from her brow. \u201cIf only we had a real barn for such work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe new place will be finished soon enough,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ve been working so hard\u2014too hard. I regret that my father can\u2019t find it in his heart to share any of his newfound riches.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cRiches indeed. Who knew the Crown gave such hearty rewards?\u201d</p><p>After Aidan left him at the dock, her father had had second thoughts and reported Fraser to the constable. And though the law hadn\u2019t given two figs for the safety of some farmer\u2019s daughter, they were quite interested in the tale of someone trading men for goods so as to avoid the Crown\u2019s taxes.</p><p>\u201cWell, he\u2019s out of my hair,\u201d she said, \u201cand finally managing on his own.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd in a flat close to his favorite Aberdeen tavern.\u201d He saw a shadow cross her brow\u2014guilt? melancholy?\u2014 and he chucked her chin. \u201cDon\u2019t worry for your father. Nor for us. What we got was reward enough,\u201d he said, referring to the bounty both he and Angus had received for their part in stopping Fraser and Captain Will.</p><p>Angus had felt guilty about the whole matter\u2014Aidan got the impression the man liked to keep a low profile\u2014 and so had given Elspeth a half-dozen sheep, two of which were breeding, in addition to pledging his help with their rebuilding.</p><p>\u201cAnd besides,\u201d he added, cupping her cheek, \u201call this bounty means I can be alone with you. Until a bairn comes.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, knowing as well as he with what diligence they\u2019d been working on that matter. She placed her hand over his. \u201cOh, husband, how glad I am that you came home, to Scotland, and not some other, more distant shore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my home.\u201d He removed the lamb from her lap, pulling Elspeth onto his instead. \u201cAnd we have so much to start anew.\u201d</p> <p>The lamb cried, standing unsteadily on spindly legs. Elspeth cooed and petted it, a smile in her voice.</p><p>But when Aidan eyed the creature, he saw something else, and said with a sniff, \u201cI don\u2019t like Angus giving you all these sheep. The man gives you too many gifts.\u201d</p><p>She shot him a startled look. \u201cNever before has Angus thought to give me a thing in his life!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm-hm.\u201d He grabbed her hand and kissed her wrist. His wife had no idea just how appealing she could be to a man. Especially now with a bloom in her cheeks, and in her fetching new gown. But it was time for her to pay attention to him. He began to kiss up her arm.</p><p>She gave him a playful squeeze, her mind clearly still on the sheep. \u201cWe need to name them all. Aphrodite perhaps,\u201d she said, studying the wee lamb, now looking amusingly bereft. Elspeth giggled. \u201cShe does have such very long lashes. Very comely.\u201d</p><p>Nuzzling her neck, he seated her more firmly in his lap. His intentions were unmistakable. \u201cYou\u2019re the only Aphrodite,\u201d he told her, kissing up her throat, along her cheeks.</p> <p>Their eyes caught, and he saw his intent matched in her gaze. The rest of the world\u2014their farm, their cares\u2014 everything fell away, until it was just the two of them. Aidan reached around to untie her spectacles. Pulling them off, he marveled at how lovely her eyes were. How wise, and sweet, and all-seeing. \u201cYou\u2019re the only goddess here. And you\u2019re mine.\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
