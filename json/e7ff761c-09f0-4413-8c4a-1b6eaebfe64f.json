Watched her in turmoil as a child, then transformed into the tenacious, alluring woman I crave today. Riley is in my mind constantly, and my need for her is excruciating. Sometimes, I can taste her, smell her; I close my eyes and I...feel her. I love her. She belongs with me. And I\u2019ll do anything\u2014anything\u2014to make her mine forever.</p><p>\u2014Victorian Arcos</p> <p>I can still hear the human screams inside my head. Demented, painful screams of pure torture and desperation. Behind my closed eyes, the slaughter at the Tunnel 9 Club rages red with human blood. It\u2019ll stay with me forever. All of this will.</p><p>With my strength weakened\u2014even the tendencies I\u2019ve acquired from being bitten by vampires aren\u2019t enough right now\u2014I can do little more than open my eyes and rest my forehead against the window of Victorian Arcos\u2019s Jag. Pitch blackness stares back at me. We\u2019re on I-16, heading north out of Savannah to Atlanta. A sign that says DUBLIN, NEXT THREE EXITS flashes by, so I know we\u2019ve been on the road for about two hours. Is that all? Seems like a lot longer. There\u2019s nothing to look at except billboards, so I stare blankly into the night. My other tendencies are still present, like my sense of smell, and I can detect the burnt grease from a truck-stop grill permeating the air. The pungent musk of perfume wafts on the wind. And it must have recently rained because the scent of hot wet tar rises to a choking pitch. I concentrate and turn my high sense of smell off. It irritates me. Right now, everything irritates me. Victorian has me under his control. I\u2019ve been taken against my will. So I do nothing but stare mindlessly into oblivion. It seems to help.</p><p>Time passes. Everything becomes a blur. I want to throw open the door and jump, but my limbs are numb, limp, lifeless, as if I\u2019ve sat in one position for too long and they\u2019ve fallen asleep. He\u2019s incapacitated me with his freaky vampiric mind control, and it royally pisses me off. There isn\u2019t a damn thing I can do about it, despite my own powers. I still try to move other parts of my body; nothing works except my head, my eyes, and eyelids. Involuntary muscles, like the ones for breathing, work to keep me alive. I am totally paralyzed. And not at all surprised.</p><p>Victorian\u2019s knuckles brush my jaw, and his hand lingers against my skin in a caress. I want to slap it away. But strangely, it comforts me. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he says, and his voice is so heavy with regret, I almost believe him. \u201cI don\u2019t like holding you against your will, Riley.\u201d I look at him, and he glances at me as the headlights of an oncoming vehicle flash across his beautiful young face. \u201cTruly. Nothing would please me more than for you to come willingly. To trust me. But you\u2019re as predictable as you are beautiful, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d He smiles, and his teeth radiate an inhuman whiteness in the shadows of the Jag. Only the fluorescent glare of the stereo illuminates his features. \u201cBesides. I have to drive.\u201d</p><p>Victorian Arcos. Moving my eyes in his direction, I stare at him. Sharp, aristocratic features and long black hair pulled back into a queue remind me of someone who\u2019d once dueled with pistols long ago. I want to hate his guts. A centuries-old Romanian strigoi vampire, he and his brother, Valerian, were once entombed in a grave by my Gullah grandfather\u2019s ancestors. Now they\u2019re free, thanks to my brother, Seth, and his rowdy friends, who inadvertently set loose the dangerous vampire brothers. Valerian is pure evil, and he\u2019s taken Savannah and Charleston by murderous, bloodlust-fueled storm.</p> <p>Vic, though...He\u2019s a bit different. I don\u2019t particularly trust him, but he\u2019s not a psychotic killer like his brother. And for some reason, even though Victorian has used his strigoi mind powers to force me to leave with him, I can\u2019t hate him. I know that he\u2019s trying to protect me.</p><p>I left behind pure carnage at the club. If Victorian hadn\u2019t come for me, I would have stayed and fought. I left behind a lot of loved ones, left them to fight without my help, and I feel like shit about it. I should\u2019ve been there. Period. But Victorian wouldn\u2019t hear of it.</p><p>Why would Victorian want to protect me, you ask? I still don\u2019t know the answer. There is a connection between us, live and palpable, and he knows it as much as I do. I think it goes beyond the DNA we share. He and Valerian bit me and injected me with their toxins, connecting me to both of them. It\u2019s what gave me these tendencies. Their rare strigoi vampire bloodline makes me even more unpredictable than your average human with tendencies. Don\u2019t ask me to explain it any more than that. All I know is that I now have crazy superhuman powers, which Preacher, my Gullah surrogate grandfather, says will evolve over time.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you get a Jag, much less learn to drive?\u201d I ask, curious.</p><p>\u201cI taught myself. Not much to it really. As for the car, I obtained it the same way that I got you to sit so polite and still,\u201d he answers. \u201cPower of suggestion.\u201d</p><p>I glare at him. \u201cYou stole it.\u201d</p> <p>Victorian sighs and gives a single nod. \u201cI stole it.\u201d</p><p>A few moments pass in silence. I try to move my hand toward the door handle. I summon all of my strength, so much that I shake inside, but it\u2019s no use. Still paralyzed. The thought crosses my mind that Victorian could totally take advantage of me in my motionless state. He could touch me, rape me. No, wait. He possesses the power of suggestion. He could make me want to have crazy nasty sex with him, and I\u2019d do it. He could even drain my blood. Yet, he doesn\u2019t. Why is that? Why is he taking me away? And more to the point\u2014where? I\u2019d asked him earlier, and he\u2019d simply said, \u201cWhen the time is right, I\u2019ll tell you.\u201d Those questions and more pull at my brain as weariness overcomes me. The world fades away as my lids close over my eyes. For a while, I rest. As I drift off, I feel Victorian smoothing back the hair from my face.</p><p>I don\u2019t know how long I sleep before the visions take over, but they, too, trap me just as easily as Victorian\u2019s mind control. Behind my closed lids I lie awake, once again envisioning the macabre bloodbath we\u2019d left behind hours ago at Tunnel 9. With a forceful jab, my senses kick in, and in my dream state I slip under just enough to return to that place of horror. Just outside of my dream state, I can hear \u201c24\u201d by Jem filtering faintly from Victorian\u2019s stereo through my auditory senses. Soon the music shifts within my dream state, my body seems to float, and I know the music now comes from the surround sound at Tunnel 9. It\u2019s sifting through the hazy room filled with humans. They dance, moving to the music, rubbing their bodies seductively against each other. Invisible, I look around. Most are high as a frickin\u2019 kite. Some are just sex-crazed, hormonal twenty-something-year-olds trying to get laid. Others are partying, drinking. All are being hunted. I am nothing more than an invisible bystander. Watching.</p><p>The first drop of blood is shed as a newling attacks a human. Newlings are nasty, out of control, brand-new vampires with a voracious appetite. They have no decision-making skills and zero self-control. With an involuntary inhalation, I smell it. Taste it on my tongue. I even lick my lips. A scream breaks through the music, and I turn to see the owner of that first drop of blood. A not-so-young guy, maybe thirty. Pale skin, black eyeliner. That\u2019s as far as I get in my inspection because his head is now literally hanging on by a flap of skin at the side of his neck. He just stands there, teetering, alive but not, his body in shock after a newling chewed through his throat, spinal cord, and bone to get to his artery. That\u2019s the thing about newlings. Inexperienced. Starved. Fucking messy. They haven\u2019t learned yet to go straight for the heart.</p><p>All hell breaks loose then; newlings filter through the crowd of partiers. The humans try to fight at first. More blood is shed. Newlings rip into their victims. The heavy metallic scent hangs in the air like fog, thick with fear and hunger. The humans scream, run. There\u2019s so much blood; arterial spray on the walls, on the humans, pooling on the floor. Deep within me, a pang takes me by surprise. I feel all warm inside, then scorching hot. The sensation fires from my core, down both arms to my fingertips, down my torso, legs\u2014to my toes. It claws at me. It is need. It\u2019s so fierce, so vicious, I cry out.</p><p>Why am I reacting like this? I\u2019m not a vampire. I\u2019m not a newling. I\u2019m a human with tendencies. I may have taken on some of the traits of vampires when Victorian and Valerian bit me, but I\u2019m not like them. This sensation, or whatever it is, scares the hell out of me. Yet something pulls at me. Unfamiliar. Desperate. Horrifying.</p><p>My eyes fix on a human; I don\u2019t see male or female. I smell only the warm blood coursing through their veins. As I breathe in, I can taste it on my tongue. I want it. Need it. Will do anything to get it.</p><p>I lunge.</p> <p>In reality, my body begins seizing. I shake, shudder, convulse. Slowly, the screams fade; the metallic scent weakens. My need is still strong though, and I struggle to bring the scent of blood back. In the darkness, I can no longer see the humans; the club has disappeared. I\u2019m on my back on a firm yet soft surface. I now smell pine, fresh cut grass. Slowly, I open my eyes.</p><p>The sounds and smells around me bring me back to the present. I\u2019m no longer in Victorian\u2019s Jag. I\u2019m lying on the ground next to a parking lot; cars and semitrucks whiz by on the highway, unevenly, at various speeds. A can dispenses through a soft-drink machine. Laughter echoes in the distance. A stereo system blasts Twisted Sister, one speaker blown in the back. My vision clears as I fixate on what\u2019s before me. Victorian is straddling me. He has my arms pinned above my head. Holding me still. My eyes scan past him. We\u2019re at an interstate rest stop. Concrete buildings with restrooms and drink machines.</p><p>I find my voice, and I struggle against him. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>Victorian studies me. His grip on me tightens and he frowns. \u201cYou don\u2019t remember?\u201d</p><p>For a second, my brain races. I don\u2019t remember, and I don\u2019t lie still enough to try to make myself remember. I buck\u2014hard. Victorian\u2019s grip breaks, I leap up, and take off. My legs are weak, though, and no sooner do I make it ten feet than I\u2019m down again. Struggling, I manage to find my footing and take off. Slices of light from several tall lamps illuminate the side of the concrete building of the rest area; I avoid it and run straight for the shadows and the trees beyond. My body jerks, and my knees give out. Once more, I force myself up and try to run. Strength floods my body so intensely, I can feel it, as though strength itself is a liquid and someone has poured it straight into me. With arms and legs pumping, I fly through the darkness. Speed is one of my tendencies, and I\u2019m fast as hell. I don\u2019t care who sees me. It\u2019s not like there are a lot of people out at the rest stop at two a.m. In seconds I\u2019m sifting through dense pines, and because I\u2019m still wearing the same gauzy skirt, tank, and Vans I had on at Tunnel 9 hours before, brambles grab my bare legs and scratch the holy hell out of them. I don\u2019t care. I have to get away. Ease the craving now gnawing at my insides\u2014 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I jerk to a sudden stop. Confusion webs through my mind, and my memories race wildly. Craving? I crave only Krystal burgers and Krispy Kremes. Sugar. Greasy food. Those are my cravings. So what the hell is\u2014</p><p>A body rushes mine and I am once again flung to the ground. Without looking I know it\u2019s Victorian. Sharp pine needles and cones littering the wood dig into my skin as his weight presses against me. My face is smashed into the damp leaves and moss.</p><p>Quickly, my hands are tethered together.</p> <p>\u201cSorry, love,\u201d Victorian apologizes. He binds my ankles together, too. \u201cYou can\u2019t imagine how I hate this, but somehow\u201d\u2014he helps me stand, then looks at me\u2014\u201cyou broke free of my suggestion.\u201d His head cocks to the side as he studies me, and the moonlight shooting a slender beam through the trees glances off his face. \u201cIntriguing. I\u2019ve never met another who can break free of my suggestion.\u201d</p><p>Rage fills behind my eyes, pounds in my chest. \u201cWell, now you have. So now what? What are you gonna do now, Vic? Throw me over your shoulder like a sack of dog food and haul me to the car?\u201d</p><p>The slightest of smiles tips his sensual lips upward. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m going to do.\u201d In one move, Victorian bends his knees, and in the next instant, over his shoulder I go. He keeps his hands secured around my calves. God only knows my skirt is probably up around my waist, booty to the wind. We move out of the woods and start across the lawn of the rest stop, past the concrete picnic tables and restrooms. No one is around. Only a few semitrucks, their drivers more than likely sleeping. It wouldn\u2019t do any good for me to scream; Victorian would simply suggest to anyone who heard that I was really okay, and they\u2019d believe. So I keep quiet.</p><p>Until I hear the lock click and the Jag\u2019s trunk open.</p><p>\u201cNo way,\u201d I say, my voice only a little uneven, unsure. \u201cVictorian, do not put me in there.\u201d</p> <p>He puts me in there. Lays me gently on a soft, down comforter. Had he expected to have to use his trunk to contain me? Warm brown eyes look down at me with obvious regret. Almost makes me forget what he is. \u201cI apologize. I truly hate this. But for you to break free from my suggestion?\u201d He shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019re stronger than I thought\u2014than you even think you are. You\u2019re a danger to yourself, Riley. I can\u2019t let anything happen to you.\u201d His stare bores into mine. \u201cI couldn\u2019t live with it.\u201d The trunk starts to close.</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d I say frantically. He waits. \u201cWhere are you taking me?\u201d</p><p>Lowering his hand, Vic grazes my jaw with his knuckles. \u201cSomewhere safe. Somewhere I can help you.\u201d</p><p>Without another word, he closes me in. The moment he does, I hear another voice rise.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck are you doing, man?\u201d a deep voice says, full of shock and anger. \u201cI saw you put that woman in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you\u2019d be better off minding your own business,\u201d Victorian warns evenly, gentlemanly.</p> <p>A heavy thump hits the back of the car. \u201cPerhaps you\u2019d be better off shutting the fuck up and opening the motherfucking trunk,\u201d the stranger says. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>I have a bad feeling. Why isn\u2019t Victorian using his suggestive powers to make the man walk away?</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck\u2014\u201d</p><p>The only noise I hear is a choked gurgle.</p><p>The car door slams, and in seconds, the purr of the Jag\u2019s engine rumbles around me. I know without having seen what just happened. Victorian fed. In his defense, he tried to warn the guy. In the guy\u2019s defense, he was trying to save me. It\u2019s all so messed up. Victorian shifts gears and roars up the interstate. We\u2019re on the move. To where, I have no clue.</p><p>The one question I have right now is where the hell did a centuries-old vampire get friggin\u2019 tie-wraps? I jerk my ankles and wrists\u2014no go. That thick, hard plastic won\u2019t budge even a fraction. In fact, they tighten. So I relax and try to forget I\u2019m in the back of a trunk, bound. And that back at the rest stop, a man lay dead in the parking lot, his blood drained. I close my eyes, the sound of the road and the Jag\u2019s engine a respite. Everything seems so messed up now.</p><p>I think of the one thing in my life that calms me right now: Eligius Dupr\u00e9. An ancient vampire from Paris, he and the Dupr\u00e9 family have been Savannah\u2019s guardians since the 1700s. After making a pact with Preacher\u2019s Gullah ancestors, who inhabited the isles off Georgia\u2019s coast, they became the city\u2019s protectors from rogue vampires.</p> <p>Never did I think I\u2019d fall for a creature of the night. Or that he\u2019d fall for me. I\u2019m not cutting myself down, but seriously. I\u2019m not everyone\u2019s type. I\u2019m taller than most women. My back and arms are covered in wicked dragon tattoos, along with a dark angel wing inked at the corner of my left eye. I have pink highlights. And my past is far from stellar. As a teen, I got into everything a kid could. Drugs. Gangs. Ditching school. Luckily, with the help of Preacher and his wife, Estelle, I cleaned up my act. Went to school, became a successful tattoo artist with a shop in the historic district called Inksomnia. Still, I\u2019m damaged goods. Eli overlooked my past, though, and only sees me now. Shocking, to say the least.</p><p>Eli is different. Actually, his whole family is different. They\u2019re...real. They love one another, like humans. I can\u2019t put it any other way. I\u2019ve grown to care for Eli\u2019s papa, Gilles Dupr\u00e9; his mom, Elise; his brothers, S\u00e9raphin and Jean-Luc; and his baby sister, Josephine. In all honesty, they helped save my life.</p><p>As I drift between sleep and awareness, a vision of Eli crowds my mind; his face, his jaw, his eyes. Ebony hair against alabaster skin. Blue eyes so clear, it almost hurts to look at them. Protective nearly to a fault, Eli is always conscious of my surroundings and cautious of any outsiders. The way he touches me; his lips against my skin. The sex is incredible. Mind-blowing doesn\u2019t fully describe it. More than the sex, though, is how he makes me feel. If Jerry Maguire hadn\u2019t said it first, I\u2019d tell Eli, \u201cYou complete me\u201d and sincerely mean it. Yet I can\u2019t admit even to myself, much less to him, that I love him. How screwed up is that? The last words Eli spoke to me as Victorian drove me away from Tunnel 9 resonate inside my memory.</p><p>I will come for you.</p><p>I believe Eli. But how will he know where we are headed? The look on his face as I drove off with Victorian had been one of anguish\u2014betrayal\u2014then determination. All in about five seconds. It\u2019s not in Eli\u2019s nature to give up. I think he probably was that way, even as a human. Before vampirism. It\u2019s definitely a quality I like.</p><p>Time flies by. I drift in and out of slumber. So much has happened since the night my baby brother, Seth, and his pals inadvertently released Victorian and Valerian Arcos from their entombed graves. It was then that I learned that Preacher and his mystical Gullah ancestry were responsible for putting the Arcos brothers away in the first place. The Gullah are direct descendants of the African slaves brought to the Americas. They grew to be a proud, strong culture as they gained their freedom and claimed the outer islands of Georgia and South Carolina. Preacher\u2019s forefathers had bound their families with the Dupr\u00e9s in an effort to protect Savannah and its surroundings by, well, taking the savagery out of them. The Gullah supplied the blood Eli and his family needed in a humane and safe way. No lives were lost, no newlings created.</p><p>The biggest vampiric threat to Savannah and the Gullah had been Victorian and Valerian Arcos. They raided the city and countryside in the eighteenth century. All those who supposedly died from yellow fever in Savannah\u2019s history? It wasn\u2019t the fever that took them all. But you won\u2019t find that in any book.</p><p>Vic was more or less forced on this rampage by his overbearing brother. But once they were entombed, the city fell quiet. Peaceful. Until they were released. Seems like a long, long time ago. Now I\u2019m in the middle of it all. The same vampire who ravaged the city centuries ago wants my ass.</p><p>I\u2019d be a liar if I said Valerian Arcos didn\u2019t scare me. He does. Truly.</p><p>The back of my legs and back are sweaty atop the down comforter, and quills are poking through the material and sticking into my skin. I wish I could get a small breath of fresh air. I don\u2019t know how long we\u2019ve been driving, but I\u2019ve reached my limit. With the flat of my Vans, I start kicking the side of the Jag\u2019s trunk interior. I kick for maybe five minutes before the car comes to a stop. Victorian\u2019s door opens and closes; the trunk pops. The scents of rubber tires and motor oil fill the cool air. I look around. We\u2019re in a large underground area\u2014one that echoes. Concrete walls and pillars fill my vision. Vehicles are sparsely parked. There\u2019s an exit sign with an arrow pointing to the right a few yards away. It hits me. \u201cWhy are we in a parking garage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d he asks, ignoring my question and pushing my long choppy bangs from my face. He traces my sooty angel wing ink on my cheek. Concern is etched in his face.</p><p>\u201cYou mean besides not having any air to breathe and being hot as hell? Not to mention I\u2019ve had to pee for the last hour. Sure. I\u2019m great, Vic.\u201d I glower at him. \u201cGet me out of here.\u201d</p><p>The corner of Victorian\u2019s mouth lifts in a slight grin, which quickly disappears. His face hardens; he glances around. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to hurry.\u201d Easily, he lifts me from the trunk and sets me on my feet. \u201cAre you going to make me carry you again?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d I say. \u201cBut as soon as we get to where we\u2019re going, you\u2019re telling me everything.\u201d</p><p>He nods, and produces a pair of wire cutters from his pocket. In a few quick snaps, my ankles and wrists are free.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d he says, slamming the trunk and grasping my elbow. He leads me through the parking garage that is slightly lit and mostly empty. A sign catches my eye: WELCOME TO HARTFIELD-JACKSON ATLANTA INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT. My stomach plummets. \u201cVic, where are you taking me?\u201d He\u2019s putting me on a plane? To where? I don\u2019t have a good feeling about this. Not at all. And I have to pee. Bad. \u201cVic. Bathroom?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Again, he is silent. But we walk toward the stairs, and thankfully, a set of restrooms are there. \u201cMake it fast, Riley,\u201d Vic says. \u201cAnd please don\u2019t try to run.\u201d</p><p>The bathroom is empty. I duck into a stall and make hasty business out of girly business. Flushing the toilet with my foot, because public bathrooms are just the grossest of gross, I step to the sink and turn the water on.</p><p>\u201cRiley, come on,\u201d Victorian says. Impatience edges his voice.</p> <p>\u201cGive me a sec, okay?\u201d I answer. I suds my hands and rinse. The paper towel dispenser is empty, so I dry my hands on my shirt and head out. Victorian is staring at me. \u201cSee? No running,\u201d I say. Silently, he takes me by the elbow and leads me onward.</p><p>We make it to the elevator, and Victorian pulls me inside. I know he\u2019s using all of his suggestion to keep me restrained because I try to break free. This time, I can\u2019t. He presses the button for the main floor. Just as the doors begin to slide together, I catch a scent. A familiar scent. I can hardly believe it. Eli\u2019s here.</p><p>Suddenly a hand appears in the narrow divide between the doors, and with my next breath I am literally snatched out of the elevator by my arm and flung to the ground. I land with a grunt on the concrete floor of the parking garage, ten, twelve feet away, on my side. Eli\u2019s brother, S\u00e9raphin\u2014Phin for short\u2014is there when I stand. Confusion and surprise squeeze my insides. He helps me up. Rather, he yanks me up.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d he asks. His hands are everywhere, checking me for injury. As I knock him away, my eyes search for Eli. The moment I see him, I leap for the elevator.</p><p>\u201cRiley, stop!\u201d Phin yells, as he makes a grab for me but misses.</p> <p>I don\u2019t listen. I can\u2019t listen. Because I know Eli.</p><p>He\u2019ll kill Victorian.</p><p>Not only does Vic represent a heinous order of vampires from Romania, he is also in love with me, and Eli knows it. Bad combination, despite the fact that he isn\u2019t an evil bloodsucker and I definitely don\u2019t return the passion. Vic and I do share a connection of sorts, but it\u2019s not love on my part. Eli doesn\u2019t care. In his eyes, Victorian needs to die. Especially since Vic\u2019s DNA is now bound with mine. To Eli, Victorian Arcos is a deadly threat, through and through. I don\u2019t blame Eli. But I have to defend Vic.</p><p>Just as I hurl myself at the elevator, Eli and Victorian fall out of it. In a mass of growls, grunts, Eli\u2019s French expletives, and Victorian\u2019s Romanian curses, we all hit the ground. Eli morphs into his vampiric state\u2014fangs dropped, face contorted, eyes white with a pinpoint scarlet pupil. It\u2019s a frightening sight. Victorian\u2019s appearance also changes; even now, it\u2019s unlike anything I\u2019ve seen. His skin is ashen, almost...dead looking. Not just white. His eyes are bloodred, his fangs long and jagged. With one hand, Eli shoves me away and I hit the ground again. With a violent curse, I jump up, but Eli and Victorian are already thirty feet away. They\u2019re tangled, snarling, throwing one another to the ground. I run as Phin tries to grab me. Just as I reach them, I stop. With one hand around Victorian\u2019s throat, Eli takes his other hand and tries to fling me again. I slap his hand away.</p><p>\u201cEli! Stop it!\u201d I yell, and throw myself between them. It\u2019s like being in the middle of a pair of fighting pit bulls. \u201cNow!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMove, Riley,\u201d Eli growls, his voice inhuman, nearly inaudible. He once more tries to hurl me.</p> <p>I cling to Victorian, but my eyes are fastened onto Eli\u2019s. \u201cNo, damn it! Stop and listen to me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhin!\u201d Eli shouts. \u201cGet her the fuck out of here!\u201d</p><p>With as much emotion as I can summon, I hold Eli\u2019s gaze. \u201cPlease, Eli. Don\u2019t kill him.\u201d I\u2019m not used to begging, and it doesn\u2019t sit well with me. As a matter of fact, it sort of sounds stupid. But in this, I have no choice. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>Phin\u2019s hand is on my shoulder, and he pulls. I resist.</p><p>Eli\u2019s inhuman white glare freezes onto mine. \u201cWhy?\u201d he asks, his voice deadly smooth, even, quiet. I can tell he is confused\u2014hurt. Angry is a given. I don\u2019t blame him.</p><p>Behind me, Victorian\u2019s body shudders, but I keep my eyes trained on Eli\u2019s. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I answer honestly. \u201cIt...just doesn\u2019t feel right.\u201d</p><p>Eli\u2019s sharp gaze flicks to Victorian. It\u2019s filled with hate. \u201cDoesn\u2019t feel right, Riley? He abducted you.\u201d His grip tightens on Victorian\u2019s throat. \u201cHe almost killed you.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, I already know all that. It doesn\u2019t matter. \u201cHe isn\u2019t the monster his brother is,\u201d I say. \u201cPlease. Trust me.\u201d</p> <p>Eli literally shakes with rage. The scarlet pupils widen, like a cat\u2019s eyes adjusting to darkness. He knows Victorian\u2019s brother wants me dead. Valerian is, in every sense of the word, a monster. There\u2019s no telling how many he has either killed or turned. He\u2019s the most feared of predators. A serial killer who cannot die. At least, not easily. And he\u2019s got a personal grudge against me. Why, I don\u2019t know. Maybe because I\u2019m the one who got away. I beat him, and he hates that. Maybe because his own brother cares for me. But I know Victorian isn\u2019t like Valerian. And I don\u2019t want him dead.</p><p>\u201cEligius,\u201d I say calmly, and he looks at me. \u201cMove.\u201d</p><p>Pure white eyes stare at me in silent debate for what seems forever. Without looking at Victorian, he manages to say, \u201cNot until he tells me what the fuck is going on.\u201d</p><p>Moving from between them, I turn to Victorian. Bloodred eyes seek mine. I keep my hand on Eli\u2019s arm for support and give Victorian a nod. My stomach churns with anticipation.</p><p>Victorian simply breathes for several seconds, head bowed, collecting himself. His shoulders, broad but slim, rise and fall with air I\u2019m certain does not circulate within his lungs. When he lifts his head, the only remnants of his vampiric morphing are his eyes. They remain crimson and fixed on me. \u201cRiley has too much of my brother\u2019s strigoi DNA. It\u2019s...changing her.\u201d He glances at Eli. \u201cChanging her in ways even her dark brethren cannot cure.\u201d His Romanian accent is heavier at times, like now. \u201cShe is beginning to crave. I\u2019ve seen it.\u201d His voice lowers. \u201cShe will kill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will what?\u201d I ask, shocked, staring back at Vic. \u201cAre you friggin\u2019 crazy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit,\u201d Phin says, and his angry voice echoes off the concrete walls of the parking garage. \u201cShe went through weeks of cleansing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou underestimate the power of a strigoi,\u201d Victorian replies.</p><p>\u201cFuck you,\u201d Phin returns.</p><p>\u201cWe underestimate nothing,\u201d Eli says quietly, deadly. Threatening. \u201cYou\u2019re wrong, Arcos.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe broke my power of suggestion,\u201d Victorian argues, flashing me a glimpse. \u201cStarted growling, convulsing.\u201d He glances at me, then to Eli. \u201cNearly jumped from my car going eighty-five. I had to pull over and restrain her physically, and even then she briefly overpowered me. I had to chase her down as she tried to escape.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo where were you taking her?\u201d Phin asks. His voice does not sound like his own; he is getting impatient. Out of character for S\u00e9raphin Dupr\u00e9.</p><p>Then again, the flashes I\u2019d had while running through the woods behind the rest stop had been out of character for me. Those weird cravings. What the hell was that? I convince myself it was nothing more than a residual effect from the trauma at Tunnel 9.</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d Eli states. His patience is going fast, too.</p><p>Victorian\u2019s unholy gaze settles on mine. \u201cTo my family home in Kudzsir in Romania. To my father.\u201d</p><p>I blink, and Eli\u2019s body flies in front of me. By the time my vision finds them, Eli has Victorian crushed against a wall. \u201cSo you can turn her? Have her for yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEli!\u201d I yell.</p><p>With his face close to Victorian\u2019s, Eli growls, \u201cI\u2019ll fucking tear your limbs from your body and burn them myself before I let that happen. And I\u2019ll start with your goddamn head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I run now, because Eli\u2019s looking like he\u2019s about to dismember Victorian right where they stand. Someone grabs my arm and I jerk to a jolting halt. I turn and glare at Phin. \u201cYou\u2019d better turn me loose.\u201d</p><p>Phin just looks at me. Tightens his grip.</p><p>Just then, a beam of light arcs over the gray concrete walls of the garage; an SUV pulls in.</p><p>\u201cEli, let\u2019s go,\u201d I plead. \u201cNow. Just forget about this. I\u2019m all right. I\u2019m with you.\u201d</p><p>At first, he ignores me\u2014nothing new there. Then he flings Victorian across the parking lot, storms toward me and grabs my hand without breaking stride. He doesn\u2019t say a word. Electricity seems to sizzle around him. If anger causes that, he\u2019s got an aura of it.</p><p>Victorian has more balls than I credit him for. In the blink of an eye, he is standing directly in Eli\u2019s path. \u201cKnow this, Eligius Dupr\u00e9. Only a powerful strigoi like my father can cast out the evil growing inside Riley. And you will soon see\u2014it is definitely there. You\u2019ll not like it, I promise you that.\u201d</p><p>Eli stares at Victorian for a split second, then takes his hand and shoves him out of the way. We continue on through the parking garage. I turn and watch Victorian.</p><p>\u201cYou will soon see,\u201d he says, standing in place. He speaks to Eli, but his eyes are on me. \u201cYou\u2019ll bring her back to me. I will be here, waiting.\u201d</p><p>We round a corner, and Victorian is no longer in sight. I find it strange to think of how Victorian, a vampire himself, considers vampirism evil. Maybe he dislikes what he is as much as the Dupr\u00e9s do. He has a good heart, despite the fact that it no longer resides in his body.</p><p>We reach Phin\u2019s black Ford F-150 in tense silence. In the distance, I hear a door slam and an engine start up. I guess it\u2019s Victorian\u2019s Jag. Phin hits the lock release button on his keychain and Eli opens my door. As I put my foot on the side step to climb in, he stops me.</p><p>With both hands on my face, he kisses me\u2014long, ungentle, desperate. I breathe in his scent and return the kiss. Unlike most members of the undead, Eli\u2019s lips aren\u2019t icy cold, but lukewarm, full and sensual as they devour mine. Then, he pulls back. With startling blue eyes, he inspects me from head to toe. At my exposed thigh he lingers, lowers his hand, and grazes a large scrape. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMust\u2019ve gotten that at the rest area,\u201d I say, and although his features are cast in shadow, I know he studies me with ferocious intensity.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go home,\u201d he says, and climbs in beside me. No smile. Eli is still angry.</p><p>Phin starts up the truck and exits the parking garage. It\u2019s not until we hit Peachtree Street that I realize Victorian and I had made it all the way to Atlanta.</p> <p>According to the digital clock in Phin\u2019s truck, it\u2019s close to four a.m. Traffic is nonexistent as we weave through the tall buildings and intertwining interstate dissections of downtown and make our way back to Savannah. Before we hit the interstate, Phin pulls into a BP and fuels up. I run inside and grab some drinks and a bag of Chic-O-Stix. Eli\u2019s gaze is locked onto me the entire time. We settle in for the drive home.</p><p>Even with Eli\u2019s body crowding mine in the cab of Phin\u2019s truck, his hand protectively on my thigh, one thought pounds through my brain; one thing needles me and doesn\u2019t let go.</p><p>Am I truly turning evil? Am I going to kill?</p><p>Will I crave blood?</p><p>Goddamn, I hope to hell not.</p> <p>I\u2019m sleepy again\u2014why, I don\u2019t know, but I feel like I haven\u2019t slept in days. I close my eyes, and slumber soon takes over.</p><p>Part Two</p><p>TURMOIL</p><p>Dat girl ain\u2019t right. I noticed time dey brought her back home. She got a mean look in her eye dat don match her face, or her mouth. I\u2019ve seen it before, on odders, a long, long time ago. I know what it is, too. It\u2019s evil, dat\u2019s right. Pure dead evil. I don know if I can save her dis time, but I\u2019ll die tryin\u2019.</p><p>\u2014Preacher</p><p>I feel different. Ever since I returned home from my wild ride to Atlanta in Victorian\u2019s trunk, I can feel it. And that was over a week ago. It could be nothing more than my own imagination messing with me; it could be something else entirely.</p> <p>Victorian\u2019s shocking words that night rattled me. I may not have shown it, but they did. And Eli hardly leaves my side now, even less than before. As a matter of fact, right now is the very first time since we\u2019ve returned that he\u2019s left me alone for more than an hour. Eli did not go easy. But Preacher needed his and Seth\u2019s help next door repairing a leak in the attic, so I\u2019m taking full advantage of the situation and chillin\u2019 in a hot bath. It\u2019s Sunday evening, there\u2019s finally a chilly bite to the mid-October air, and the shop\u2019s closed. I\u2019m relishing this time alone. Need this time to myself. Desperately.</p><p>Resting my head back against the air pillow, I sink deeper into the hot suds and close my eyes. How long ago it seems since Seth and I discovered everything Preacher had tried to shield us from. After our encounter with the Arcos brothers, sweet Seth\u2019s personality totally changed. He wore stupid shades over his eyes all the time, slept all day long, and stopped eating. We didn\u2019t know what was happening until we saw Seth hurling himself out of his top-story window, only to hit the ground running. The image will be emblazoned in my memory forever.</p><p>He\u2019d nearly turned. But Preacher and his Gullah brethren, skilled in the cleansing of vampirism passed down by their ancestors, saved Seth. Saved his pal Riggs. Saved me, too. I know I wouldn\u2019t be in the bathtub right now had it not been for Preacher and Estelle.</p><p>Like me, Seth and Riggs have tendencies. Mine are the strongest of all. Preacher warned me that my powers would change constantly, but the feeling growing inside me is unexpected. It leaves a bad taste in my mouth. I just hope Seth isn\u2019t going through the same thing. I\u2019ll tell you now: I\u2019d die if something happened to my brother.</p><p>My thoughts return to Victorian\u2019s words. Eli\u2019s actions. Ever since our encounter with Vic, Eli\u2019s been more intense. The fact that he won\u2019t leave me alone is a definite sign that he thinks something really bad is up, too. He knows I can handle myself, but lately he treats me like I have zero abilities. He\u2019s everywhere. Being protective is one thing. Not giving me space to breathe is another. But I have to be sympathetic. I know, long ago, that Eli accidentally killed a young woman he\u2019d fallen in love with. He\u2019ll never forgive himself for it, and I\u2019m pretty positive he\u2019s scared the same thing will happen to me. It won\u2019t. But there\u2019s no consoling him. Eli still worries he\u2019ll lose control with me. So he\u2019s careful. Extremely careful.</p><p>His image comes easily to my mind; his chiseled face, full, firm lips, clenched jaw. His disturbing blue eyes are always locked on me. And his expression? Painful. Like he\u2019s in absolute physical agony. Kind of like when we first met.</p><p>Eli\u2019s siblings are around a lot more, too, always in the shop. Phin, intense and always so deep in thought. With his short-clipped dark blond hair and crazy-clear Dupr\u00e9 eyes, he\u2019s an attention getter to be sure. And he\u2019s on my ass just as much as Eli lately. Eli\u2019s other brother, Luc? He and Phin could pass for twins, but Luc\u2019s hair is longer, with wild curls. He\u2019s definitely the clown of the three brothers, although I\u2019ve seen him turn pretty stinking mean in a vamp fight.</p><p>My best human friend and business partner, Nyxinnia Foster, has claimed Luc\u2019s attentions of late. I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d like it, their coupling, but I do. Nyx is totally crazy about Luc, and he is just as into her. Nyx, with her sweet, loving, and annoyingly trusting behavior, is an easy target for Valerian and his gang of newlings. She\u2019s a Goth princess and sticks out like a sore thumb. Luc protects Nyx. I feel comforted knowing that. I love Nyx like a sister.</p> <p>Speaking of sisters, there\u2019s Eli\u2019s youngest sister, Josie. She looks like your average teen, with skinny jeans, Converses, and long, light brown hair nearly to her waist. She wears it parted in the middle with her bangs pinned to the side. Sweet as peaches, you might think. I know better, though. She can fight like her brothers. Trust me when I say it\u2019s weird as hell to watch her kill. But she\u2019s free-spirited and a kind soul. Unfortunately, she\u2019s forever trapped in her fifteen-year-old body and is crazy about Seth. He\u2019ll age. She won\u2019t.</p><p>I\u2019m surrounded by people I love, so I\u2019m usually on my best behavior. But these days, I have to think about my next words, my next move, my next interaction with anyone I come in contact with. My fuse is shorter. Even when dealing with clients, I catch myself before saying something awful. It doesn\u2019t take much to set me off. It\u2019s like there\u2019s this shade of irritability that lies just beneath the surface, ready to unleash. Luckily, I can sense it. It\u2019s like...I can feel this thing clawing at the lining of my insides, trying to escape\u2014digging, scratching, whispering. Almost like an entity, living inside of me, separate from my own self. I have no idea what keeps it locked up, other than my own will. But it wants out. I can tell. Weird. Just...weird.</p><p>Sometimes I wonder if Eli detects it, too. The way he stares at me? It\u2019s beyond intense. His eyes go deep into mine, searching, perusing. I swear I can feel him inside of me. He can read my thoughts and is constantly in my head now, yet he still can\u2019t pick up Victorian\u2019s voice in my head. I wonder if he can sense this other thing? Because I swear, I feel like it\u2019s alive inside of me. It\u2019s like Eli...knows it\u2019s there but just waits. Watches. I guess he trusts me to let him know when I can\u2019t control it anymore. I hope to hell and back that day never comes.</p><p>The clicking of paws through my room alerts me to my dog Chaz\u2019s arrival. He pushes the door open with his nose and peers in at me. He whines.</p><p>\u201cHey, boy,\u201d I croon. \u201cWanna go for a walk?\u201d</p><p>His back end wags, just before he lets out a single bark. And I swear, he smiles.</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay, I\u2019m coming,\u201d I say, and climb from the tub. Quickly drying off, glad I\u2019d pinned my hair up instead of washing it, I change into a pair of sweats, long-sleeved Inksomnia T-shirt, and my black Adidas sneaks, pull my hair into a ponytail, and head downstairs with Chaz. He lets out an excited yelp as I grab his leash and hook it to his collar. We head outside.</p><p>The chilly bite sinks into my skin and we take off up the merchant\u2019s drive. As Chaz inspects every little thing, I scan our surroundings. We\u2019re all alone. I allow my hearing to open full blast. At first chaotic, with sounds and voices and music all overlapping, soon it filters, becomes selective as Eli has taught me. I listen for anyone who signals distress\u2014a tinge of panic in their voice, or excited talking, pleading. All I hear is swearing, ice clinking in glasses, idle chatter, a fight between angry guys. Drawing in a lungful of air, I taste the inhalation. Allow it to settle against my tongue. Newlings, I\u2019ve discovered, have a unique scent. Slight though it may be, if I concentrate, I can detect it. It\u2019s not smelly, or pungent, but it\u2019s definitely different from anything else. Tonight, I smell nothing. So far, anyway. I have no idea of the distance my wolflike capabilities and senses are able to travel. Guess I\u2019ll eventually find out.</p><p>Chaz takes care of his doggy business, but I\u2019m in no mood to head back inside. Something pulls me, something inside of me. The crisp night and unusual tranquility of the city lure me, and we cross Bay Street and head into the squares. There are scattered tourists on benches or strolling along the walk, a few locals. Time slips by\u2014how much, I don\u2019t know. It has become unimportant. Along with the crispness of October, there is dampness in the air that suggests an approaching storm. Soon, the crowds thin. Loud, drunken laughter spills from The Boar\u2019s Head on River Street. Although I\u2019m on Broughton, it sounds as though I\u2019m right in the bar. I can feel the heat from the patrons\u2019 bodies. Smell their cigarette smoke, their breath, their sweat. Almost taste the alcohol they\u2019ve consumed emanating from their pores on my tongue. Irritation and disgust consume me, and I try to tune those senses out. It doesn\u2019t work. The sounds of the city, the scent of humans, suffocate me. Wait, I\u2019m still human. Aren\u2019t I? Hell if I know what I am anymore. All I know is that I\u2019m unsettled. Confusion makes my brain hurt. I begin to run. To escape.</p><p>For a block or two, it\u2019s a slow run, and I\u2019m still vaguely aware of Chaz on the other end of the leash I\u2019m still gripping. At some point, though, I drop it. He follows for a while, but soon he can\u2019t keep up, and I feel glad to be alone. As his single bark echoes off the brick buildings surrounding me, I slip farther into the shadows, away from Broughton Street, away from people. The night envelops me, swallows me up like some ravaged beast, and for a brief second the Eagles\u2019 \u201cHotel California\u201d plays in my mind. They stab it with their steely knives, but they just can\u2019t kill the beast. For some reason, that line has always freaked me out. I like it. It\u2019s my favorite verse. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The sharp blast of a car\u2019s horn sounds to my left, and for a second I jolt out of the weird subconscious state that I\u2019m in. A Ford Explorer has slammed on its brakes to keep from hitting me. I can\u2019t make out the driver\u2019s words. He flips me off. I make eye contact with him and keep on running. Soon, in the shadows of tall live oaks and wispy moss, I slow to a jog, then a walk. The sounds that plagued me earlier are now a dull hum, and within minutes fade to nothing. Have I run so far that I\u2019ve escaped the city? People? Am I finally alone?</p><p>Then, a heartbeat. Not mine. Someone else\u2019s. Steady. Strong. Ahead of me.</p><p>I follow.</p> <p>The small town of Thunderbolt. That\u2019s where I am. As I move beneath the sparsely spaced streetlamps, I watch ahead of me. Male. Young. Early twenties. His tall, lanky figure casts a long shadow as he jogs. A rain begins to fall. Light at first, then more steady. It lifts the jogger\u2019s scent and wafts it to me. I inhale deeply. Sweat. Soap. I inhale again.</p><p>Blood.</p><p>I grow closer. Twenty feet. Ten feet.</p><p>A strong hand encircles my arm and jerks me to a stop. I\u2019m aware of very little around me, save the jogger getting farther away. Rain slides down my cheeks, drips off my nose, plasters my hair to my scalp. My eyes remain fixed on the jogger.</p><p>His scent remains fixed in my nostrils.</p> <p>\u201cRiley!\u201d an angry voice growls in my ear. The grip tightens on my arm. Shakes. \u201cRiley! Look at me!\u201d</p><p>When I don\u2019t, the hand belonging to the voice grips my chin and physically turns my head. Large hands grasp both sides of my face, tilts it up. Uses his thumbs to brush the water from my eyes. He\u2019s standing close, intimate. I\u2019m staring, but not seeing. All I can hear is the sound of a heartbeat growing farther and farther away. It fades to nothing, and for a split second, my mind goes totally blank.</p><p>Slowly, the sounds of the city, the scents surrounding me, filter in. The blankness lifts. A horn blasts. A door slams. Somewhere, someone is whistling. I blink several times. These sounds are familiar.</p><p>\u201cRiley?\u201d</p><p>Eli\u2019s face comes into focus. Dark brows pulled together, the streetlamp\u2019s shine winking off the silver hoop. His face has hardened in anger. Or is it worry? His hands caress my face, so I guess it\u2019s worry. Why he\u2019s in that state, I haven\u2019t a clue.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d I ask.</p> <p>Eli\u2019s look is...invasive. I know he\u2019s probing my mind. Yet it seems he struggles this time. \u201cWhat are you doing out here, Riley?\u201d he asks. \u201cChaz showed up at Inksomnia alone.\u201d</p><p>I glance around. How\u2019d he get away from me? I shrug. \u201cWent off chasing a squirrel. Yanked the leash right out of my hand. He\u2019s done it before.\u201d I give Eli a reassuring smile. \u201cSee what a smart boy he is? Went straight home.\u201d</p><p>Eli\u2019s frown deepens. \u201cYou\u2019re out in the rain,\u201d he says, \u201cyour mind is blank and you\u2019re stalking some jogger.\u201d He peers down at me and a wet hank of shaggy midnight hair falls across his eyes. \u201cYou weren\u2019t aware of your surroundings, Ri. Or of me walking right up on you.\u201d</p><p>Again, I shrug. And chuckle. \u201cSo now I\u2019m a stalker? That\u2019s just crazy, Dupr\u00e9.\u201d I sigh and give him a long look. \u201cI\u2019m fine, Eli. I was just lost in my thoughts is all.\u201d I play-punch him in the arm. \u201cYou worry like an old lady.\u201d</p><p>Eli\u2019s eyes don\u2019t leave mine. Even as we both stand in the rain, he studies me. \u201cDid you know that guy?\u201d he asks.</p><p>I glance around, my eyes seeking the dim streets beneath the lamps. I see no one. \u201cWhat guy, Eli? I was just out for a run. Nothing more. Nothing less. Can we get out of the rain now?\u201d</p><p>Eyes on fire search mine. The black T-shirt Eli\u2019s wearing clings to his body from the rain, and every muscle there is perfectly etched beneath the thin cotton material. I look at him. He looks at me. His eyes narrow.</p><p>Finally, he drops his hands, lets my face go. \u201cHome. Now.\u201d</p> <p>Home. Eli has pretty much moved in, and it\u2019s worked out so far. We take off at a jog in the now steady drizzle, Eli purposely one step behind me. Within minutes we\u2019re crossing Bay and easing over the cobbles to the merchant\u2019s lane, then to Inksomnia. As I move to open the door, Eli stops me. I look up at him.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I ask.</p><p>After several silent moments, he shakes his head. \u201cI\u2019m having trouble reading you,\u201d he says. A frown still tugs at his mouth.</p><p>I smile. \u201cAnd that\u2019s a bad thing? Hmm. I get my private thoughts back. How...ordinary.\u201d</p><p>With his knuckles, he skims my jaw. \u201cI don\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>I grab his hand and lace our fingers together. His are, as always, lukewarm, steely-strong. \u201cTough.\u201d I open the door and pull him inside. Chaz is there and immediately barks. Next, Seth and Josie are in the foyer, right behind him.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to you?\u201d Seth asks. \u201cWhy\u2019d Chaz come home without you?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cYou too? What is this?\u201d I glance from Eli to Josie, then back to Seth. \u201cTwenty questions? I went for a freakin\u2019 run is all. Chaz yanked the leash out of my hand. I knew he\u2019d come back here. Jesus.\u201d I said that last bit under my breath. I was irritated. Tired of being drilled. \u201cLast time I checked I didn\u2019t have to wear an ankle bracelet.\u201d</p><p>The look on Seth\u2019s face caught me right in the gut. Hurt. Surprise. And I wasn\u2019t used to it. But damn\u2014I couldn\u2019t help it. I was tired of being interrogated. \u201cChaz got away from me. That\u2019s all. Now can I go take a shower please?\u201d I don\u2019t wait for an answer from anyone. I push past Seth and Josie and head upstairs. In my room, I kick off my sneakers, pull my shirt over my head and fling it onto the floor. I peel off the wet pants I\u2019m wearing and go straight into the bathroom. After a moment of nothing but hot water, the room fills with steam. The water pelts my back and shoulders as I stand there, thinking.</p><p>That was what happened, right? I had Chaz on the leash, and then...he wasn\u2019t there anymore. We were jogging. He...pulled loose. I decided to finish my run because I knew he\u2019d head on home. Then Eli appeared and freaked out. We came home. End of story.</p><p>They, I decide quickly, are all fucking nuts.</p><p>It\u2019s slowly happening, isn\u2019t it, love? The changes? I warned that barbarian you keep company with, but he wouldn\u2019t listen. Please, Riley. You must leave. Come back to me. I vow, I\u2019ll do everything in my power to help you.</p><p>I rub the water from my eyes. Victorian still has the ability to communicate with me through my mind; it\u2019s annoying and comforting at the same time. Can\u2019t explain it, not at all. It is what it is. Leave me alone, Vic. There\u2019s nothing wrong with me. And holy hell, you too? I just got reamed by my brother and Eli. I don\u2019t need it from you, too. Get out of my head and let me shower in peace.</p><p>Christ, woman. You\u2019re naked? In the shower? Why do you torment me so? Never mind. I can still see remnants of tonight\u2019s events in your mind. You\u2019re getting confused, aren\u2019t you, love? It will only get worse. Trust me.</p><p>I am not confused, damn it. Now go away.</p><p>I continue to bathe\u2014wash my hair, scrub my skin, rinse. I can still feel Victorian\u2019s presence. How, I don\u2019t know. But I do. What are you doing, Victorian?</p><p>After several seconds, he answers. You don\u2019t want to know.</p><p>Yes I do. Why are you still here?</p><p>I can\u2019t stop thinking of you naked; your skin wet, slick with soap. It easily places...images into my head. I can\u2019t help myself when that happens, Riley. I\u2014</p><p>Yeah, yeah, never mind Loverboy. Don\u2019t wanna know. Later, Vic.</p><p>For a certainty, my love...</p><p>After drying off and pulling on a pair of soft sleep pants and a tank, I brush my teeth, hit the lights and climb into bed. Exhaustion makes my bones heavy, my skin ache, and just as I slip into sleep, Eli\u2019s strong arms pull me against him.</p><p>\u201cRest,\u201d he whispers against my temple, and despite my sleepiness, the feel of his lips moving across my skin makes me shiver. \u201cI\u2019ll be here when you wake up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d I mumble, sliding my arm over Eli\u2019s chest and snuggling close. \u201cHave we become that old couple that doesn\u2019t have sex anymore?\u201d</p><p>Eli\u2019s chuckle rumbles against my ear. \u201cWe had sex this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I say, already being pulled into slumber. \u201cSorry if I was a bitch earlier. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with me.\u201d</p><p>Again, Eli\u2019s lips brush my skin as he kisses me, and his arms tighten around me. \u201cEverything\u2019s going to be okay, Riley. I swear to God, it will be.\u201d</p><p>That last part I barely hear, but it slips into my subconscious, where I keep it safe. Keep it all safe\u2014Eli\u2019s arms, his strength, the brush of his lips across my skin. Somehow, I know that I\u2019ll need those reassuring words, those memories. Later. For now, I sleep.</p><p>It\u2019s raining. Still dark outside. Streetlamps throw an amber hue over the wet cobbles. Close by, a tire hits a pothole and water splashes against the fender. Footsteps slap the sidewalk. A heartbeat echoes off the brick walls. Human. I blink and listen, then I look around. Why am I outside? Didn\u2019t I just fall asleep, warm in my bed with Eli\u2019s arms wrapped around me? I know I did. So why am I here? How did I manage to get away from Eli?</p><p>I look around, but see only a long shadow at the end of the lane. The shadow\u2019s moving and it matches the footsteps I hear. They\u2019re quick, sure\u2014not like those of a stumbling drunk. More like...someone who is frightened. I hurry toward the sound, the long-moving shadow. The heartbeat grows louder, faster, and the pungent scent of fear clings to the brine of the Savannah River that perpetually hangs in the air. I am closer now, the heartbeat reverberating off the damp stone around me. Now, only that taunting beat sounds in my head. Nothing else. The human senses me. Hides. The scent of blood hovers like mist in the air.</p><p>A craving quickens inside me.</p><p>Silently, I edge along the shadows toward the hiding place. Closer. A whimper reaches me, then a strangled cry. Just as I ease around the corner of the alley, I see them. There are two. They\u2019re young\u2014one male, one female. Newlings. Suddenly, I\u2019m confused. I react. I leap. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGet her,\u201d the male says. His voice is calm, hateful, determined.</p><p>The female newling lunges at me just as I leap at her, and with a growl, we clash and drop to the cobbles. I grab her by the throat and slam her into the wall. Immediately, she\u2019s up and lunging at me again. I duck. She hits the opposite wall and I follow her. I have her arm jacked upward behind her. I have the strength to tear it from her body, and I almost do. Until I hear a cry, and I glance down.</p><p>\u201cHelp me, Riley!\u201d</p> <p>My blood runs cold at the familiar Filipino Dagala dialect.</p><p>The male, fangs dropped, is biting the human. Only then do I notice the short black bob, small stature, wide, frightened brown eyes rimmed by a pair of glasses. It\u2019s my neighbor, Bhing, who owns a chic clothing boutique next door to Inksomnia called SoHo. I throw the female newling several feet away and she crashes against the steps. I lunge at the male and yank him off of Bhing. She scrambles backward.</p><p>\u201cBitch,\u201d he grinds out, and with more strength than I credited him for, grabs my throat and lifts me. Eyes opaque, one small red pupil in each center, he glares. No mercy. No pity. Only rage and hunger. \u201cDon\u2019t fuck with my kills, freak,\u201d he says. The streetlamp light shines off his jagged fangs.</p><p>With lightning reflexes, I wrap my legs around his waist and jam the heel of my palm into his throat. He turns me loose, and as he drops to the ground, I crawl toward him, yank the silver blade strapped to my lower back, and plunge it into his heart. He seizes, and I jump off him. I glance up; the female is running toward me. In one fluid motion I pull the blade from his heart and fling it at the female. It embeds to the hilt. She drops and begins to seize.</p><p>The craving returns. I turn for the human.</p> <p>But the alley is empty now; Bhing has disappeared. Out in the street, I search. Empty, all except for a stray cat perusing the trash cans. Bhing\u2019s gone. It\u2019s only then that I realize why I killed the newlings.</p><p>I wanted their hunt. Their prey.</p><p>I wanted Bhing\u2019s blood.</p><p>With both hands, I grasp my head and stumble back into the alley. What\u2019s happening to me? Dizziness swamps me, and I drop to my knees, gulping in large breaths. Nausea crashes over me, and I fight to keep whatever was trying to come up down. With hazy vision, I notice two piles of ash on the ground. The only thing that can kill vampires is pure silver. Or another vampire.</p><p>I\u2019d killed them with my silver blade. But had I done so to get to Bhing\u2014or to save her? My head spins, and I push myself against the wall. Confusion grabs me by the throat, squeezes, chokes. Blackness crashes over me, and I see nothing, hear nothing, smell nothing...</p><p>\u201cHey, sleepyhead,\u201d a graveled, slightly French accent whispers in my ear. \u201cWake up.\u201d</p> <p>My eyes flutter open. Uncertainty and disorder web their way through my memory. Where am I? The room is hazy, with the barely there early-morning light filtering in through the gauzy curtains. My bedroom. I fix my gaze on the figure leaning over me, weight supported by one elbow, chiseled face staring down at me. Eli. I\u2019m in my room, with Eli.</p><p>His eyes bespeak volumes. I know he immediately senses my confusion. He frowns. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>Pushing up on my elbows, I sit up. \u201cHad a bad dream,\u201d I said, trying to recount how I\u2019d gotten from the alley to my bed without Eli or Seth knowing I\u2019d left the apartment\u2014if I\u2019d left at all. Suddenly I wasn\u2019t so sure. I look at Eli. \u201cHave I been here all night?\u201d</p><p>Eli\u2019s eyes narrow. \u201cWhy would you ask that?\u201d</p><p>Frustrated, I jump out of bed. \u201cDamn it Eli, stop answering my questions with more questions.\u201d Pulling the curtains back, I stare out over River Street. \u201cHave I been in bed with you all night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he says, and moves behind me. Wrapping his arms around me, he pulls me against him. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>I relax. \u201cDamn, it was so realistic. I...was out in the street, at night, and I saw Bhing from next door getting attacked by two newlings. I killed them. Bhing got away.\u201d I turn and stare up at his concerned expression. \u201cThen I felt, I don\u2019t know. Sick. Dizzy.\u201d I shrug. \u201cNext thing I know, you\u2019re waking me up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant me to go check on Bhing?\u201d he asks.</p> <p>I sigh and move out of Eli\u2019s arms. \u201cNo. I will. If it really happened last night I\u2019m sure I freaked her out. Besides, I want to go visit Preacher and Estelle before I get ready for work anyway.\u201d Preacher and Estelle keep a store, Da Plat Eye\u2014a Gullah herbs and concoctions parlor\u2014right next door. They live upstairs, just like I live above Inksomnia.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not there,\u201d Eli says. \u201cRi, they left Monday morning to go visit Estelle\u2019s sister in Charleston. Don\u2019t you remember?\u201d</p><p>Slowly, I turn and look at Eli. My insides turn cold. \u201cToday is Monday.\u201d</p><p>Eli\u2019s face is drawn, worried. \u201cToday is Wednesday.\u201d</p><p>I close my eyes, push my fingertips against the sockets. What\u2019s happening to me? I\u2019m now losing chunks of time? I scramble in my memory, trying to remember. I recall going to bed, then suddenly being outside, fighting two newlings over Bhing\u2019s blood. The last thing I want to do though is freak Eli out. The very last thing. I chuckle, shake my head. \u201cGod, I\u2019m getting old. Dream must\u2019ve sucked the life out of me.\u201d I glance at Eli. \u201cNo pun intended.\u201d Glancing at the clock on my bedside table, I stretch. \u201cI\u2019m starved. Think I\u2019ll go grab some Kremes and coffee. Wanna go with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Eli says.</p><p>I don\u2019t think he plans on letting me out of his sight anytime soon. It already pisses him off to no end that he can\u2019t read my mind like he used to. The Arcoses really did a number on my DNA. Since it keeps changing, I have no idea where I\u2019ll end up. Me. Riley Poe. What\u2019s left of me, anyway. I can\u2019t bullshit Eli for long about my loss of time. Don\u2019t want to. It scares the shit out of me, truth be told. I\u2019ll try to handle it first. See what Victorian can tell me. Maybe I can learn to control it like I have my other tendencies? I hope to God so.</p><p>\u201cHey, bro, running to KK,\u201d I say. \u201cWant anything?\u201d</p><p>Seth glances at me, his usually bright expression dull. \u201cNo thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething wrong?\u201d I ask, perplexed.</p><p>Seth\u2019s gaze lingers on mine for a second or two, almost as if he\u2019s waiting on me to guess. \u201cNo,\u201d he finally answers, and pulls on his jacket. \u201cNothing\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019re you going?\u201d It\u2019s not like Seth to be so sullen with me, but lately, we\u2019ve both been through so much crap, we\u2019ve learned to give each other a little space.</p><p>\u201cSchool, Ri,\u201d he answers. \u201cMrs. Dupr\u00e9 likes me there early.\u201d Elise home-schools Seth and Josie.</p><p>I nod. \u201cOkay. Later.\u201d</p><p>Seth, silent, walks past me and out the door. I try to ignore the hurt I feel and look at Eli. I\u2019m pretty sure the smile I paste on my face looks fake as hell. \u201cReady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe just worries about you, you know?\u201d he says quietly.</p><p>I grab the Jeep keys from the hook and head out. \u201cYeah. I know.\u201d</p><p>The moment I step outside, I see Bhing at the Dumpster. She is heading back into her store and she spares me a single look and a wave. Her silky black hair, cut in a shoulder-length bob, swings with her every movement. She stares at me through her glasses. I wave back. So, she\u2019s safe after all. I wonder what she\u2019s thinking?</p><p>We make it to Krispy Kreme and back in thirty minutes. I eat four glazed doughnuts and sip my sugar-and-cream-loaded coffee while going over a few ink designs I have scheduled for the day. I can tell my head isn\u2019t in the game, or in the food, and both tick me off. What\u2019s more frustrating is that I don\u2019t know what to do about it. Sometimes it\u2019s worse than others. These feelings are relatively new. Eli knows my irritation; he watches intently as I dress for work in a pair of ripped, faded low-rider jeans, a black Inksomnia long-sleeved tee and a pair of worn boots. Pulling my hair into a high ponytail, I brush my teeth and head downstairs to open shop. I feel anxious. Unsettled. Maybe it\u2019s because I haven\u2019t seen Preacher and Estelle. I just can\u2019t figure it all out.</p><p>I hear Nyx a full three minutes before she enters the shop.</p><p>Rather, I hear her heart beating.</p><p>For a split second, just before Nyx opens the front door, my vision blurs. The sound of Nyx\u2019s heart thumping inside its cage reverberates inside of me. Her blood whooshes through the vessels as it races to and from the organ. I can friggin\u2019 hear its resonance. I shake my head a few times, take some breaths, close my eyes, clear my head. Rid my brain of it. Goddamn it! What the hell?</p><p>\u201cRiley.\u201d Eli stands next to me, his hand on my shoulder, his voice stern, steady. Almost as if he knows my inner turmoil. I glance briefly at him. My mind begins to clear.</p><p>\u201cRiley! Good morning!\u201d Nyx greets as she steps inside, and I turn my attention to her. Luc is right behind her. Gene, the Welcome Raven\u2014appropriately named after Gene Simmons\u2014crows above the door. For some reason, both sounds annoy me. Nyx drops her oversized pink handbag with black skull and crossbones at her station and crosses over to me. She pulls me into a tight hug. In the span of a few seconds, she assesses me. \u201cYou didn\u2019t get much sleep, huh? Poor thing. You look tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGee, thanks,\u201d I say, and move to the iPod station. \u201cIsn\u2019t that the same thing as saying I look like shit?\u201d</p><p>Nyx yanked my ponytail. \u201cYeah, pretty much. So get some more sleep. I know you don\u2019t need as much anymore, but a little more couldn\u2019t hurt. You have dark circles under your eyes, Ri. You\u2019ve lost all the color that you got from Da Island when you were rehabilitating and between your pale skin and dark circle eyes, you actually look like a, um. You know.\u201d</p><p>I glance over my shoulder at Nyx, who passes a single look to first Eli, then Luc.</p><p>\u201cWhat? You mean a vampire?\u201d I ask. I almost laugh.</p><p>\u201cYes! But more like a Hollywood version. Dracula. You know?\u201d she replies. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Luc approaches and grasps my chin with his hand, turning my face left and right. His eyes, the same shade of cerulean blue as all the Dupr\u00e9s, study me with intensity. \u201cDamn, Poe. You do look like shit.\u201d</p><p>I jerk away. \u201cI gotta get busy.\u201d Feeling like some Freddie Mercury, I select \u201cKiller Queen\u201d and start work. I tune out Eli, Luc, and Nyx, as well as my own bad mood as I sift through my designs. Without looking up, I feel all of their eyes on me. Eli\u2019s gaze is burning into me like a branding iron. This morning I simply don\u2019t care.</p><p>My first appointment arrives. I\u2019m freehand outlining a fairly large spider over the ribcage of a lanky young dude. Not an ounce of body fat on him. \u201cTake off your shirt and get comfortable,\u201d I say, and point in the direction of my table. \u201cYou okay with an audience?\u201d</p><p>The guy shrugs. \u201cSure, no prob.\u201d</p> <p>I nod and flip the switch to the Widow, my beloved tattooing machine. Or, as Estelle calls it, the Black Engine. As I\u2019m setting up the ink pots, I glance at him. \u201cHow\u2019s your pain tolerance?\u201d</p><p>Again, he shrugs. \u201cI\u2019m good.\u201d</p><p>I again nod. \u201cIf you need a break just let me know.\u201d I thumped his ribs. He didn\u2019t even budge, which was a good sign. \u201cYou have zero body fat. It\u2019s not gonna feel great over those bones, dude. Promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m cool, I\u2019m cool,\u201d he assures. \u201cI can take it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right then,\u201d I say, shaking my head. I\u2019m not in any mood for a crybaby today. I scrub his side with antiseptic. \u201cLie with your arm resting above your head on the pillow and let\u2019s get going.\u201d</p> <p>The kid\u2019s good. He doesn\u2019t even flinch as my needle moves over his bumpy ribs. The hum of the Widow mixes with Freddie Mercury\u2019s unique pitch and blessedly pulls me into the zone. All is going pretty well for a handful of minutes. I feel like my old self. I sense my old life, before vampires, newlings, and tendencies. Before the Arcoses. I\u2019m in there, barely hanging on by a thread.</p><p>I lean close over the kid\u2019s ribs, freehand sketching the body of the spider that is approximately eight inches in length, six inches in width. I move with my needle, wiping the blood with a four-by-four-inch piece of gauze. I wipe. Blood. Wipe. Blood.</p><p>Blood.</p><p>Queen\u2019s \u201cAnother One Bites the Dust\u201d is now fading away in the background, and becomes muffled until it is nothing more than a soft hum. Nyx\u2019s happy chatter fades. Luc\u2019s constant flirting fades. Eli\u2019s totally silent. Only one thing remains.</p><p>This kid\u2019s heartbeat.</p><p>Thump-thump. Thump-thump.</p> <p>I take a deep breath, shake my head, and continue.</p><p>The needle penetrates the skin in rapid-fire shots as I move along, creating the outline of the spider. My gaze fixes on the beads of blood, and I wipe with the gauze. I continue. More blood. Not a lot. Just beads. But there are a lot of them. The more I stare, the more I concentrate. What was a line of ink with whelps of blood turns into filleted skin as my needle plunges three inches into the kid\u2019s side. Blood pours out. I jerk back in horror.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d the kid says. His voice is shallow, as though it\u2019s calling from a deep tunnel. He peers over his ribs at where I\u2019m working.</p><p>I glance at him, and his face is concerned, but nothing more. When I look back at his side, it\u2019s perfectly normal. I blink, shake my head. Sweat breaks out across my forehead and I wipe it with my forearm. \u201cNothing. My needle jammed is all,\u201d I lie. \u201cI\u2019ll change it fast. Just relax.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo prob,\u201d he says, and lies back.</p><p>I turn to change the perfectly good needle, and Eli\u2019s at my ear. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d he asks quietly. Even his voice sounds muffled, and I know he\u2019s mostly speaking inside my head. He sounds far, far away.</p><p>The whole while, I hear that kid\u2019s heart beating.</p><p>I draw another deep breath. \u201cNeedle jammed,\u201d I say. \u201cEverything\u2019s fine.\u201d</p> <p>I glance at Eli\u2019s face to reassure him. He\u2019s not reassured at all. His face is pulled into lines and sharp planes of worry. He says nothing. Only watches. Behind him, Luc does the same. Both irritate me. But Eli\u2019s constant presence seriously annoys me. I try to block him out.</p><p>I continue with the spider and the kid.</p><p>Focusing on my work, I try to block the thumping of his heart. It takes such strength to manipulate the sounds around me that sweat again breaks out across my forehead. It\u2019s almost what drug or alcohol withdrawals feel like, and I can speak from experience on that one. Your body craves, and turns itself inside out to fight off that craving. It feels like a thousand ants are crawling inside your skin, trying to break free. I try to ignore the feeling, try not to rush, take my time, making the legs of the spider design angled, defined, and structured. I\u2019m almost finished. Thank God. Just a little more.</p><p>Thump-thump. Thump-thump.</p><p>I glance at the kid\u2019s face, and I gasp and stumble back. His eyes are missing, sockets are deep and black, and his face and skin have a bluish-white hue. The area over his heart is filleted open, and the organ beats before my eyes. Beckons.</p><p>My mouth goes dry.</p><p>\u201cRiley.\u201d</p><p>A hand tightens around my upper arm, squeezes hard. I blink and wipe my sweaty brow. When I look at the kid, he\u2019s okay. Normal. Staring at me.</p><p>I force a smile. \u201cOkay. All done.\u201d I set my needle on the stainless steel tray. \u201cYou did good. Didn\u2019t even flinch going over all that bone.\u201d</p><p>The kid, thankfully, is oblivious to my turmoil. He smiles proudly. \u201cThanks.\u201d Cocking his head, he stretches and looks at my work. \u201cAh, freak! That\u2019s sick!\u201d</p><p>My insides are still shaking, and his heart is still slamming in my ear. \u201cGlad you like it. Let\u2019s cover it up now.\u201d</p><p>He lies back, and it\u2019s all I can do to apply the antibiotic ointment and cover the area with nonstick gauze. I tape the edges. \u201cYou\u2019re good to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweet,\u201d he replies, and hops off the table. \u201cWhen can I come back for the color?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt has to be completely healed,\u201d I say, and I wipe my brow again. \u201cNo scabs, no raw places. Let\u2019s set you up for four weeks and see how it looks.\u201d</p><p>The kid nods. \u201cCool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d Luc says. \u201cMeet me up front and I\u2019ll give you instructions and ointment samples.\u201d He glances at me, and I give a half smile. He inclines his head and leads the kid up front.</p><p>Only now do I realize the crowd that has gathered in Inksomnia. It\u2019s not an unusual crowd. It\u2019s not at all strange for a large group to gather at the picture window and watch us work, or a group to stand inside and look through the design books. Inksomnia is sort of well-known, especially in the tattoo world, and I\u2019ve made quite a name for myself as an artist. People have traveled far just to have me ink their design. People who\u2019ve never even heard of me gather at the window to watch the tattooing process. It\u2019s not weird to have a crowd nearly every day. It\u2019s not strange to have people ask to take pictures with me.</p><p>It\u2019s strange that I didn\u2019t know they were here in the first place.</p><p>I feel sick. Nauseated. Out of control. Adrenaline soars. Heart sluggish. Sweaty.</p><p>\u201cMs. Poe, can we get a pic with you?\u201d someone in the group asks.</p><p>\u201cJust a sec,\u201d I say, nausea choking me. I head to the back before I toss Krispy Kremes everywhere. When I glance at the crowd, their faces are all gruesome: eye sockets black, white-blue skin, and the hearts are all beating so hard I see it through their shirts. I stumble. What\u2019s going on?</p><p>Eli catches me just before I fall and eases me onto the steps of the staircase. I sit, elbows on knees, head hanging between. I gulp in air.</p><p>Kneeling in front of me, Eli pushes my escaped bangs from my face and holds them to my head with one hand. \u201cRiley,\u201d he says, and I hear the urgency in his voice. \u201cWhat is wrong?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe I\u2019m coming down with the flu?\u201d That\u2019s such a damn lie and I know it. Eli probably knows it too. I don\u2019t know what else to say. The truth? Human heartbeats are consuming my thoughts. I smell their blood. I\u2019m starting to crave.</p><p>No friggin\u2019 way can I tell him that. Victorian already did and Eli didn\u2019t believe him. Thank God he can\u2019t hear it in my head, nor does he recall his own torturous turning. I breathe deeply and give myself a pep talk. Get a grip, Poe. It\u2019s just your wacky DNA morphing again. Gilles said this would happen. Don\u2019t be a baby! Talk to Vic. He can help. It\u2019s part of him inside you anyway. You can handle this. Breathe...</p><p>The slow, rhythmic strokes of Eli\u2019s fingers over the back of my neck, along with my slow, controlled breaths, ease the cravings, lessen the noise, dissipate the nausea. I don\u2019t know how long I sit there on the steps, but I start feeling better. Finally, I raise my head and meet Eli\u2019s worried gaze.</p><p>Worried and angry gaze, I should say.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I graze his jaw with my fingertips. \u201cI feel better now.\u201d</p><p>The penetrating stare tells me Eli doesn\u2019t believe it. Not one word.</p><p>\u201cPromise,\u201d I say, and stand. \u201cCome on. I have a pic to take.\u201d</p><p>Eli says nothing as I pass by and head back to the front of the shop. His brother is equally grim; Luc studies me as I make my way to the crowd of guys gathered for the pic, and I slide him a quick look and then fasten my attention to the ink fans. Someone pulls out a digital camera, I stand in the middle of the crowd, and several pics are taken.</p><p>\u201cCan we see the dragon?\u201d one younger guy asks.</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d I say, \u201cyou caught me on an off day. Nothing underneath here this time,\u201d I say, pointing to my shirt. \u201cSummer is the best time to catch that.\u201d People who know or have heard of me always want to see the dragon inked on my back, courtesy of Nyx. In the summer, I wear clothes that easily show most of it, or I wear a bikini top underneath my shirt so I can take off whatever I\u2019m wearing and show off for the onlookers. It\u2019s become sort of my trademark. Today, though, I\u2019m not into it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A few groans go through the crowd, and Nyx waves to them. \u201cHey! We have a few postcards over here with Riley and me. You can see the dragon perfectly!\u201d</p><p>Everyone moves to the sales counter, and Nyx shows the rack of postcards. She glances at me, and I mouth thanks.</p><p>I don\u2019t understand it, but the rest of the day passes smoothly. I have no further episodes. No further cravings. Heartbeats recede. Only normalcy.</p> <p>I don\u2019t break for lunch but work through instead. By six p.m. I am wrapping up my last client: a Savannah College of Art and Design, better known as SCAD, student with a dainty black butterfly arm cuff. Her arm is as big around as a pipe cleaner, so it doesn\u2019t take me long. I apply her ointment, cover with gauze, and give her instructions. In the fading light falling on Savannah, she walks down the sidewalk, happily chatting on her cell, stretching her arm out and admiring her art through its gauzy cover.</p><p>My memory skips back to the past, when Nyx inked my dragons. I remember not being able to stay away from mirrors, I wanted to look at them all the time. To me they meant struggle, conquering demons, strength. Empowerment. I was so proud of them. I am proud of them.</p><p>A ping of envy hits me. I used to have a normal life, where a little body art made my day, made me happy beyond belief. I enjoyed Sundays with Seth, with Preacher and Estelle, and chillin\u2019 on the floor of my living room with Nyx, sketching designs. Cramming slice after slice of pizza in our mouths. Taking Chaz for walks. I want it all back. I want it all the hell back.</p><p>I\u2019ll never have it back.</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d Eli asks. His hands move to my shoulders and he squeezes gently.</p> <p>Moving out of his grasp, I start cleaning up my station. \u201cBetter. Are we heading out tonight?\u201d Meaning, are we tracking newlings.</p><p>\u201cAre you up for it?\u201d he asks.</p><p>I glance at him. The lines of worry mean he really doesn\u2019t want me to go. But I\u2019m going anyway. \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>Nyx\u2019s client leaves and she shuts and locks up the shop behind him. My friend, dressed in the style of a street mime from the fifties with black skinny jeans, black loafers, and a white and black striped shirt, minus the white painted face, turns to face me. Her high ponytails on either side of her head swing with the movement. \u201cRiley, are you sure? I don\u2019t think you\u2019re well. You could\u201d\u2014she waves her hand in the air as if trying to imagine something\u2014\u201cfall from a building or something if you have an episode.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have episodes, Nyx,\u201d I say, and move to the back and head upstairs. \u201cI\u2019ll be okay. Promise. See ya in the morning,\u201d I call down.</p><p>\u201cBye,\u201d she returns, but I\u2019m already in my room changing.</p> <p>In nothing but my bra and panties, I stand before the floor-length mirror and start fitting the blade sheaths to my waist, thighs, ankles. In the next second, and so fast that I didn\u2019t even see him enter the room, Eli stands next to me, my shoulder harness in hand. He helps me into it, adjusts the straps, and secures it in the front. One by one, he fills the sheaths with pure silver blades. His eyes are on mine the entire time.</p><p>The fact that he\u2019s so close to them makes me pause. \u201cI can do that,\u201d I say, but Eli continues anyway. I let him. When the last blade is secure, he pulls my face to his and kisses me. For a moment, I lose myself in his possessive seduction. His tongue on mine. Teeth grazing and tugging my lips. Strong hands drag across my abdomen, my hips. Then, he envelops me in his embrace. My blades press tightly against my skin at his weight. Everything he does, I realize, proves his love for me. Proves his possessiveness for me. And I can\u2019t even return the verbal sentiment? Worse yet, his over-protectiveness is starting to really grate on my nerves. God, I\u2019m such a bitch. A messed up one at that. Damaged goods to the nth degree.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll run with me tonight,\u201d he whispers against my temple. \u201cUntil I\u2019m sure you\u2019re okay, the only thing you\u2019ll do alone is pee.\u201d</p><p>I laugh, because Eli knows how I love my bathroom privacy. \u201cI\u2019ll run with whomever I want to, and you bet your ass I\u2019ll pee alone. Goddamn, Eli, give me a freaking break, will ya? I\u2019m fine. I can handle myself. Your own parents have taught me how. So, seriously. Step off a bit. Okay?\u201d</p><p>Eli pulls back, holds my face in his hands, and studies me for several long moments. His eyes search mine. \u201cI won\u2019t lose you, ch\u00e8re,\u201d he says, his French accent thicker. Demeanor determined. \u201cI won\u2019t. But you can have your space. As long as everything goes smoothly.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not that kind of girl who enjoys being the victim. I don\u2019t need the stereotypical knight in armor to rescue me. I am a strong, independent woman who has no problem handling her own goddamn self. But, I admit\u2014this feels...nice. Eli is the epitome of strength, and I trust him completely. I revel in his embrace for a few more moments because somehow, I have another feeling, boring deep into the pit of my stomach, that this won\u2019t last.</p><p>Or at the very least, I won\u2019t remember it.</p><p>My annoyance dissipates momentarily, and I thread my hands through Eli\u2019s crazy, sexy hair, pull his mouth down to mine and kiss him thoroughly. He sighs against me, a deep groan inside his chest letting me know precisely what the gesture does to him. I end the kiss, smile, and move to my closet to get dressed. Eli watches in silence as I pull on a pair of low-waist khaki cargo pants, a snug black long-sleeved spandex shirt, and my worn Vans. Strapping on my holsters around my thigh, hips, and shoulder, I slide the sharp silver blades into place. The night will hide my weapons, so no need to wear a coat over them. I redo my ponytail, pulling the band snug, and I\u2019m ready to go. When I get downstairs, Luc is just coming inside with Chaz. Nyx is sitting in the foyer, staring at me.</p> <p>\u201cI thought you were headed home,\u201d I say. I can tell by Nyx\u2019s expression that I\u2019ve hurt her feelings.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s going to stay with Mama and Papa,\u201d Luc says. \u201cI don\u2019t trust Valerian not to seek her out again, despite the Gullah charms protecting her place.\u201d</p><p>I simply nod. \u201cGood idea.\u201d</p><p>Nyx jumps up and faces me. \u201cBe careful tonight, okay?\u201d she says, and pulls me into a hug. I hug her in return, but only briefly. I fear what happened earlier might repeat itself. I sense my lucidity is slipping. I really hate that.</p><p>I look at my best friend and smile. \u201cI will. And I love ya for caring so much.\u201d</p><p>Nyx beams. \u201cLove you too.\u201d</p><p>I hate that my confidence and assuredness seem so fake and put-on to me, but right now, it does. I know this other thing exists inside of me, and it grows stronger. I fear losing my loved ones. I fear losing myself.</p><p>I have no choice but to fight it.</p><p>Fight it, and fucking win.</p><p>Nyx and Luc take off on Luc\u2019s bike. Eli and I take the Jeep. Within minutes we hit Monterey Square. I pull into the Dupr\u00e9s\u2019 drive and park. Zetty and Riggs get out of Zetty\u2019s truck. The Tibetan one-time bouncer for the Panic Room club had nearly become a newling but was also cleansed by Preacher, along with me, Seth, and Riggs. Now he\u2019s a human with wicked tendencies. We exchange greetings and head inside.</p><p>Zetty\u2019s eyes are on me the whole time. He\u2019s hard not to stare at, with his unique Shiva patterns tattooed across his forehead. At the advice of Gilles, Zetty had decided to wear less attention-grabbing clothes. Out with the traditional Tibetan wear, in with pretty much all black attire. Blend in with the shadows, so to speak. His long single braid down his back still gives him that unique and exotic look. Zetty is a badass. With or without tendencies. With them, though, he\u2019s a lethal badass. I\u2019m glad he\u2019s on our side.</p><p>We don\u2019t speak. Simply bump fists as we enter the Dupr\u00e9 house.</p><p>I catch Riggs\u2019s eye as I pass. He smiles. I\u2019m surprised the prepubescent little perv doesn\u2019t slap my ass.</p><p>He chuckles behind me. If I didn\u2019t know any better I would swear Riggs could read my mind.</p><p>Philippe Moreau, the Dupr\u00e9s\u2019 butler and all around trusted man, meets me at the door. His gaze lights over me and he gives a slight nod. \u201cMs. Poe. Ever so nice to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhil, same to ya,\u201d I say, and it draws the slightest of grins on his usually serious mouth.</p><p>Inside, I follow the others upstairs. It\u2019s become sort of our meeting room, along with our training room. Gilles, dressed casually in pressed khaki trousers and a white button-up shirt, stands next to Elise, in classic she-loafers, black dress pants, and a plum silk blouse that accentuates her flawless pale skin. Both bespeak old Southern charm.</p><p>\u201cRiley, sweetheart,\u201d Elise says, and grasps my shoulder with her petite hand. \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>I shoot a look at Eli. He must\u2019ve told her. With a sigh, I nod. \u201cMuch better, thanks.\u201d</p><p>While Elise Dupr\u00e9 looks sweet and demure, trust me\u2014it\u2019s totally deceptive. She can kick serious, serious ass.</p><p>Elise\u2019s brow pinches together. \u201cSomething\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p><p>I shrug, because I know she\u2019s trying to read my mind and is unable. \u201cIt\u2019s a new development I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere, love,\u201d Gilles says, and moves closer to me. \u201cLet me try.\u201d</p><p>I almost laugh as Gilles concentrates, staring into my eyes. The only thing he doesn\u2019t do is the hypnotic hand wiggle thing Dracula does. After a few seconds, he huffs. \u201cI cannot believe it, ma ch\u00e8re,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m positive I don\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither do I,\u201d mumbles Eli.</p><p>I say nothing but I keep my gaze locked with Gilles\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cVery well,\u201d he finally says, and addresses us all. \u201cNed tells me several rogues have moved into the area, unrelated to the Arcoses. A body was found this morning. Ravaged, with no control whatsoever. The work of a mindless newling.\u201d</p><p>My heart leaps, thinking of Bhing. But I\u2019d seen her earlier, so it had to be another innocent. Or had any of it even happened? God, it hurt my head to think of it. Bhing hadn\u2019t acted any different toward me. Maybe it\u2019s all in my mind.</p><p>\u201cI suggest we split up into threes,\u201d says Phin, perched on the windowsill. \u201cEli, Riley, and Riggs. Me, Seth, and Josie. Luc and Zetty, you\u2019re on your own.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They both nod.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s split the city up,\u201d Eli says. \u201cAnd meet back at the historic district and take that section together.\u201d He glances around. \u201cPreferences?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll take Tybee Island, Skidaway Island, and Isle of Hope,\u201d says Phin.</p> <p>Luc nods. \u201cWe got the South side up to Victory Drive, east and west.\u201d</p><p>Eli nods. \u201cAll right, we\u2019ll take Garden City and work our way through the industrial area and meet up at Forsyth Park. You know the routine. Clubs. Businesses. Dimly lit areas. Hangouts. These newlings aren\u2019t breaking into homes. Too much work for them. And they\u2019re looking for more youths.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Noah?\u201d Luc asks.</p><p>Noah Miles is a vampire, also bound by Gullah pact to protect Savannah\u2019s sister city, Charleston. He\u2019s probably one of the most beautiful beings I\u2019ve ever laid eyes on, with his unique dreadlocks and flawless pale skin and mercury-colored eyes. He knows it, too. When we\u2019d fought against Valerian\u2019s newling army in Charleston, Noah had been right there with Eli. Only Noah eggs me on. He wants to see me fight and trusts me to handle myself. Unlike Eli.</p><p>\u201cThey have their hands full right now,\u201d Eli says. \u201cThere are just as many newlings running in Charleston and surrounding areas as there are here.\u201d He glances at his father. \u201cTo break this, we have to break Valerian Arcos.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd that seems impossible since he can shift bodies,\u201d Phin says.</p><p>And if what Vic says is true, Valerian can\u2019t be killed anyway.</p><p>\u201cOkay, let\u2019s get going,\u201d Eli says. \u201cMama, Papa\u201d\u2014he heads to the door\u2014\u201cbe good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways,\u201d Gilles answers.</p><p>At the door, I stop Seth. \u201cHey,\u201d I begin. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, okay?\u201d</p><p>My brother looks at me with those big, expressive green eyes, and right now they\u2019re filled with hurt. He hugs me. My heart melts, and I hug him back. I want to keep him in my arms forever. Safe. Alive. Sweet. \u201cI\u2019m just not myself, Seth. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening.\u201d I pull back and look at him. \u201cMy DNA, I suppose. It\u2019s acting all crazy and I can\u2019t control it. I\u2019m having wicked dreams that seem so realistic, and I guess it\u2019s putting me in a terrible mood.\u201d I shake my head and knock Seth on the jaw lightly with my knuckles.</p> <p>Seth studies me for several seconds, and he pulls me into one last embrace. He kisses the top of my head. \u201cI love you, Sis,\u201d he mumbles, sounding like the much more grown-up sibling. \u201cBe careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will, and love you, too,\u201d I say. \u201cAnd you be careful.\u201d</p><p>Riggs is leaning against my Jeep when I walk out. Ankles crossed, arms over chest, looking way too cocky for his own good. \u201cWhat say I ride up front with you, babe?\u201d he drawls and glances at Eli. \u201cYou won\u2019t mind, will ya bro?\u201d</p><p>Eli smacks him on the back of the head as he gives him a shove. \u201cIn the back, Squirt.\u201d</p><p>Riggs shrugs and gives me a sympathetic look. \u201cSorry sweetheart. Maybe next time.\u201d</p><p>I can do nothing more than roll my eyes and shake my head. What a goober Riggs is. \u201cMaybe so,\u201d I respond. He smiles. I climb in the front seat, and Eli drives. We take off for Garden City.</p><p>Even though the October night air is cool, we keep the Jeep\u2019s top off for easy access in and out of it. Besides, Riggs and I both handle temperatures a lot differently now, so it has to be really cold for us to be bothered, or really hot. This night, my long-sleeved shirt is all I need. The temp is about sixty-two degrees.</p><p>Eli downshifts as we hit the squares, the night air cool as it brushes my cheeks. I close my eyes against the wind and inhale the brine of the salt marsh. Unfortunately, the closer we get to Garden City, which is just outside of Savannah, the brine turns into a stinky sulfur smell. Paper mill. It\u2019s enough to make you gag sometimes. Thankfully this night, it\u2019s not too bad.</p> <p>Eli\u2019s hand slips over my thigh and rests there as we drive, and the sounds of the night, the wind, lure me into a calm rest. I\u2019m not asleep; I still hear Riggs\u2019s iPod blasting in his ear. But I\u2019m lulled. Yeah, that\u2019s what I am.</p><p>A flash of light illuminates a face hidden in a dark hoodie. Jaw unhinged. Fangs dropped. Eyes white, pupil pinpoint red. He lunges at me\u2014but the face isn\u2019t a newling. It\u2019s me. I scream\u2014</p><p>\u201cRiley?\u201d Eli says, his hand wrapped around my arm, shaking me. \u201cWake up, we\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>My eyes flutter open, and the moment they focus on Eli, he shifts, his jaw unhinges, his fangs drop, and he lunges for me.</p><p>Part Three</p><p>MALEVOLENCE</p><p>This is all new to me. I mean, I know it\u2019s not old shoe to Ri and Seth, but they\u2019ve been involved a lot longer than I have. They\u2019ve had time to adjust. They have powers. Almost like...they\u2019re not all the way human anymore. I am. One hundred percent. Which means vulnerability to the nth degree, and it scares me. I\u2019m scared of losing Ri and Seth, and I\u2019m scared of...monsters. Of what they\u2019ll do to me. Luc promises to keep me safe, and I believe him. But who\u2019s going to keep Riley safe? She\u2019s not herself lately. Not at all. She\u2019s...mean-spirited. And there\u2019s a look in her eye that seems, I don\u2019t know, predatory to me. I don\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on with her, but I hope to God this is all over with soon. I know our lives will never return to normal, but as close to normal as possible is okay by me.</p><p>\u2014Nyxinnia Foster</p><p>\u201cRiley?\u201d</p><p>I blink, and Eli\u2019s face returns to normal. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>He studies me longer. Scrutinizing. \u201cWe\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>The night air surrounds us, a blanket of darkness void of streetlights. I blink. We\u2019re at the Amtrak station just off of 516. These hallucinations are beginning to be a pain in my friggin\u2019 ass. \u201cOkay, let\u2019s do it.\u201d I unbuckle and swing out of the Jeep. Riggs is already standing at the hood.</p><p>He draws a deep breath, then jumps onto the hood. He glances first at Eli, then me. \u201cI can smell \u2019em.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell let\u2019s go then,\u201d I say with way more enthusiasm than I really feel. I\u2019m getting used to hiding my true feelings again now that Eli can\u2019t read my thoughts. Dangerous. Seriously dangerous.</p><p>I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re thinking anymore, but I can certainly interject my thoughts into your mind. Just as you can. So if you need me, Riley, for God\u2019s sake, call me.</p><p>Startled by his sudden mind infiltration, I look at Eli over my shoulder. Is it a coincidence, my thinking of his inability to read my mind and his weird interjections? \u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>I mean it.</p><p>So do I.</p><p>\u201cBetter,\u201d Eli says. \u201cNow come on.\u201d</p><p>The three of us head out into the night. It\u2019s about nine p.m. With the Jeep stashed down an unused maintenance lane, we cover the mass of metal as we search the yard, old train cars, unused track, toolsheds. In the distance, the main Amtrak station depot has a faint glow as the lights burn. I can hear the people inside, what few there seemed to be. Some wait to catch a train. Some to pick up a passenger. All going about their ordinary lives.</p><p>None privy to the extraordinary creatures that slip through the night.</p><p>The train yard is full of shadows, and Eli leads us to a row of empty cars. In unison, we swing and bound up the side of the car closest to us until we land on top. The wind blows and I catch a whiff of something dead. A rabbit maybe? It\u2019s been dead a while, I can tell that. The stench is nauseating. I almost gag.</p><p>Eli stands, a silhouette. He turns his head, inclines it, and without words, Riggs and I follow as the eldest Dupr\u00e9 begins to leap the train cars. Eli\u2019s eyesight is nocturnal\u2014he can see just about anything, at any distance. His hearing is acute, but not as severely as mine. Nor is his scenting as specific as mine.</p><p>I sense them. They\u2019re here. Three of them. I sniff the air. They\u2019ve just fed.</p><p>Across the yard to the left, behind the maintenance sheds.</p><p>Eli doesn\u2019t question me; he doesn\u2019t even look at me or acknowledge the words I slipped into his mind. Instead he leaps off the train car and moves in the direction I say, then cuts left behind the sheds. I head right. Riggs is two steps behind me. We silently bound over stacks of railroad ties, steel beams, cargo trailers. In seconds we\u2019re in a maze of metal and wood. In the distance, the nine-thirty overnight train to Chicago blows its whistle. No, I can\u2019t tell the destination by the whistle. I Googled the train schedule on my iPhone.</p><p>Ahead of us, between two cargo trailers, are the newlings. On the ground, a motionless heap that had no doubt been a live heap not too long ago. The scent wafting off the dead human sickens me, and I suddenly realize it isn\u2019t rotting flesh or decay. The trace of remaining blood is stale. Stagnant. Dead. It all but chokes me.</p><p>I wonder how I can even detect it. Or worse\u2014why it bothers me so much.</p><p>All at once, Eli, Riggs, and I surround the newlings. The first one notices us and instantly morphs. He lunges straight for Eli. I take my eyes off of them and find the other two. Behind me, I hear the newling gurgle as Eli twists off his head. I\u2019ve learned that sound and know it anywhere. Both remaining newlings have turned, fangs dropped, and they bound for Riggs and me. Briefly, I keep my eye on Riggs. I forget how talented the little prick is. He sweeps a leg out and knocks one newling to the ground and is on him immediately, plunging a silver dirk into his heart. I turn and almost get coldcocked by the newling attacking me. He\u2019s big, out of control, and as rabid as a new vamp comes. I know he will not go down easily.</p><p>This newling is fast. Fucking fast. In the blink of an eye he\u2019s on me, has me by my throat and is lifting me up. My hearing picks up Eli\u2019s voice. He\u2019s swearing. Now he\u2019s running. Unlike a newling, I have to have air to breathe, and this idiot is squeezing so hard I can barely draw in a breath. I can feel my larynx crushing under the weight of his fingers. But before Eli reaches me, I\u2019ve got my legs wrapped around the newling\u2019s neck. He\u2019s strong as hell, but so am I. With one hand I reach for the silver sheathed at my waist, grab it, and jack it upward. It plunges into the newling\u2019s eye and, as I thought, he turns me loose. I yank out the blade and bury it in his chest. He stands there, stunned, and begins to convulse. I deliver a single kick. Down he goes. Standing there in the train yard, surrounded by shadows, I bend over at the waist and breathe. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNicely done if I do say so myself, Poe,\u201d says Riggs. He casually leans an elbow against my shoulder. \u201cCouldn\u2019t have done a better job. That blade in the eye thing\u2014\u201d He produced an exaggerated shudder. \u201cSick, Poe. Truly sick.\u201d</p><p>I slide a glance sideways. \u201cGlad to amuse,\u201d I say, and am at least glad he\u2019s stopped calling me babe. Then I shoot a quick look beside me. Eli stands, wordlessly. Scowling. I\u2019m pretty sure that translates into Are you okay but he doesn\u2019t say it. Instead, he inclines his head. \u201cLet\u2019s get out of here.\u201d I know Eli battles within himself to keep from overprotecting me. It\u2019s a good move on his part. He shows his faith by allowing me to round the train cars alone. I\u2019d probably just get pissed off if he nagged me, and he knows I\u2019m getting fed up with the overprotection. Maybe he\u2019s chilling after all.</p><p>We comb the rest of the train yard and find nothing out of the ordinary. Of course, newlings aren\u2019t going to be traipsing around with their fangs out and pupils all red and freaky. They\u2019re hiding. Waiting. Watching from the shadows.</p> <p>And in the dark corners of Savannah, there are plenty of pickings for the newlings.</p><p>Through the back streets of Garden City we run. Garden City, in all its stinky sulfur-from-the-paper-mill glory, is an industrial town just outside of Savannah. It\u2019s still in Chatham County, but honestly\u2014it ain\u2019t purty. Okay, I take that back. The nature reserve just outside the city limits is pretty cool. Lots of alligators and low-country wildlife. I haven\u2019t been back there in a while, though. No telling what you might find now.</p><p>Even the gators might be in hiding.</p><p>The night air, salty with a tinge of sulfur, washes over my face as I run. My muscles stretch, my lungs expand, and for a split second I feel invigorated. Alive.</p><p>Then that nagging weird feeling comes over me and that split-second euphoria evaporates. I\u2019m just running on instinct now, half-ass following Eli. Like a robot. A vampire-slaying robot.</p> <p>Eli runs just ahead of me and he darts down an alley in a dark subdivision behind Piggly Wiggly. Kinda difficult to speak of something dangerous and hideous as a bloodsucking newling and say the words Piggly Wiggly at the same time. Oxymoron, almost. Still. It is what it is.</p><p>\u201cLook there,\u201d Riggs says, and points over my shoulder. \u201cAt three in the morning it\u2019s never a good thing to see a group of kids huddled against a wall down a dead-end street.\u201d</p><p>I glance at him. He merely lifts his dark brows.</p><p>\u201cYou got anything, Riley?\u201d Eli asks without looking at me. I know what he wants from me. His eyesight kicks ass, but my other senses are better.</p><p>Closing my eyes, I draw in a deep inhalation and let the particles settle against my tongue. I do it again. My eyes pop open and search the canopy of oaks lining the old street a few blocks ahead. \u201cUp there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many?\u201d Riggs asks.</p> <p>\u201cFour,\u201d I respond. I can detect each separate scent of the newlings. I can even tell their sex. \u201cThree males, one female.\u201d They\u2019re hunting the humans on the street below.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s split,\u201d I say, and glance at Eli. I can immediately tell he hates that idea. Again. \u201cLess chance of one of them slipping through and getting to the humans,\u201d I add. \u201cYou know it\u2019s the only way.\u201d I quickly check myself. I say humans as if I\u2019m no longer part of the species. Weird.</p><p>Eli mutters something under his breath\u2014in French\u2014and gives a short nod. The thing about Eligius Dupr\u00e9 when searching for newlings? He\u2019s all business until the business is done. He knows what we have to do and will do it, even if he hates it. Like now.</p><p>\u201cRiggs, you take the ledge,\u201d Eli says, and points to the rooftop adjacent to the huddled humans. \u201cRiley, you get the house next door,\u201d he inclines his head, \u201cand I\u2019ll take the rooftop behind them. Wait for my signal. We don\u2019t want to have to fight the humans and the newlings at once.\u201d</p><p>I wait no longer. I nod and slip into the shadows and in three effortless leaps am on top of the roof next to where the humans stand against the wall. I glance over and notice Riggs is already in place. I can\u2019t see Eli but I am sure he\u2019s exactly where he said he would be. The night is stony still. Not a single breeze blowing now and the heartbeats of five humans resonate in my ears. The humans\u2019 low, muttered mumbling sounds like a clan of monks chanting. The thumping begins to jumble in my head, run together, confuses me. I have to shut my eyes for a moment, breathe. Concentrate and push the sporadic beats aside and focus on what\u2019s in front of me. I\u2019m having trouble, though. Almost as if something is already inside my head, taking up all the extra room I have. I shake my head to clear my thoughts, and try harder to focus again.</p><p>A moment later, Eli is bounding off his rooftop. Despite the confusion in my head, I keep my eyes on Eli. He\u2019s crouching now. He lunges. I follow. Out of the corner of my eye, I see Riggs do the same.</p><p>We are now all together in the canopy of live oaks. I never was a tree climber but damn if I\u2019m one now. I\u2019m closest to the female so I take her first. She has short spiky black hair with red tips. Her eyes narrow to slits when she sees me, the pinpoint red pupils all but glow.</p><p>\u201cLook what\u2019s come to visit,\u201d the female says out loud. Through the darkness I see the other pairs of eyes staring at me. Good. They\u2019re so fixated on me that they don\u2019t see Eli and Riggs.</p> <p>\u201cBack off, Seline,\u201d one of the males says. \u201cI\u2019d like a little piece of that fine ass before you rip her heart out.\u201d</p><p>Seline hisses. I roll my eyes.</p><p>Take the female down and get out of here, Eli says inside my head. I don\u2019t hesitate\u2014he and Riggs have my back. I simply wait my turn. It comes pretty damn fast.</p><p>The female\u2019s quick\u2014and goddamn strong. She grabs my throat and pins me against the rough bark. I\u2019m distracted by something. Sounds. A particular sound, and I hear it all around me.</p><p>It\u2019s blood rushing through veins.</p><p>\u201cYou look scared, bitch,\u201d the female said, close to my face. \u201cI like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I bet you do,\u201d I say, my fingers wrapping around the hilt of my silver. Quickly, I bury the blade into her heart. Her eyes widen and she begins to convulse. Problem is, she still has me by the throat. She falls to the ground. I go down with her. After slamming against the spindly branches of the oak, the she-vamp\u2019s body hits the sidewalk. Mine hits right beside her. Unable to help it, I let out an umph.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>The low murmurings of the humans totally cease for several seconds, then picks back up, grows louder, frantic, and as I stand, I glance over. They\u2019ve, of course, spotted us, although I\u2019m pretty sure they have no clue what\u2019s actually going on. But since they\u2019re up to something illegal anyway, they take one look at the body shaking on the cracked pavement beside me and strut right on over. A string of swear words floats through the crisp, still air, accompanied by idiotic laughter and the heady scent of Mary Jane. They haul ass in different directions. Damn, if they only knew that their high, pot-smoking butts have just been spared. Freaking idiots.</p><p>A body is thrown to the ground not four feet away. A male, convulsing. My eyes fix on his face, contorted, his jaw unhinged, fangs jagged and long. Nothing elegant about these guys\u2014at least not in the Hollywood sense. His limbs contract, his body pulls into itself and for a moment\u2014a solid split second\u2014he looks at me. Those red pupils fix on mine. Pleading, almost. I look away, sickened. By what, I\u2019m not sure. By what he\u2019d become? Or by what I do to them now? Eli appears behind me, and Riggs drops from the tree.</p><p>Eli grabs my arm. \u201cYou okay?\u201d he asks, and doesn\u2019t wait for an answer. He checks me over, his eyes studying my body intensely.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I answer, pulling my arm back. \u201cI\u2019m fine, Eli. Seriously.\u201d I\u2019m not, though, and it\u2019s anything but the few feet I fell from the tree. That\u2019s nothing. Didn\u2019t even hurt.</p><p>I\u2019m distracted, though. Something\u2019s pulling me in all directions and I\u2019m having a helluva time ignoring it. Part of it\u2019s the constant killing. Yeah, I know they\u2019re bloodsucking vamps. But they weren\u2019t always and it bothers me. Go figure. Riley Poe with a conscience. For some reason, I keep it all to myself. I don\u2019t want anyone knowing of my weaknesses, I guess. Besides, I can handle it. I can handle me.</p><p>Eli\u2019s glare tells me he knows I\u2019m bullshitting him. But I know he can\u2019t dig in my mind anymore and I let him stew. \u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d I say, and begin to move up the sidewalk. \u201cWe still have to hit the industry park before we meet the others.\u201d I adjust my blades and continue on. There\u2019s hesitancy, but Eli follows. Riggs falls in behind us.</p><p>The industrial park is tall concrete pillars and steel buildings. All is quiet; happy to report not a single drop of blood or vampire dust is shed. Riggs is a little miffed about it, and I\u2019m starting to think he digs the slaying a little too much. It takes us all of eight minutes to split up and scour the park. I use my senses to lead me, and thankfully they lead me nowhere. As I slip through the shadows, I inhale. Listen. Still, nothing unusual.</p><p>It\u2019s close to four a.m. I\u2019m making the last turn before I circle back to meet the others when the feeling hits me. Almost...a sensation, and one that begins to crawl up my spine and spread through my arms, fingers, and over my face. A muffled thump-thump resonates within me. It sounds far off, almost as if in a tunnel. I feel myself moving toward it. The sound pulls me, and the faster I move, the stronger the beat.</p><p>The heartbeat.</p><p>Then, I see her.</p><p>I stop in my tracks and ease against a brick wall, pressing my back against its scratchy surface until I blend in with the shadows and overhanging moss. With each beat that resounds within me, another sensation stirs. A craving. A desire so strong it makes my jaws ache, my stomach ping, and my breathing slow way down. Through hooded eyes I watch her. With the streetlamp casting a glow against her skin I see her perfectly. She has a slight build and shoulder-length red hair, and wears glasses. She sits on a bench, alone, crying. I pause. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Go to her, Riley. She has what you desire. What you need. You can see she no longer wants life. She weeps because her heart\u2019s been shattered. You can comfort her. Do it...</p><p>I turn my head to the left, then right. No one there. The voice, I realize, is in my head. Urging me. I want it to stop so badly, I cup my ears with my hands. It doesn\u2019t work though. The voice continues.</p><p>Go to her. Do not hesitate or she\u2019ll get away. This is your chance, Riley Poe. Listen with not your ears but your being. Her life force rushing through her with each beat. You know you want it. Soon you\u2019ll realize you need it. It will satisfy that unquenchable thirst. You have it, don\u2019t you Riley? A thirst that no drink can quench. A hunger no food can satisfy. She can help you. It will tame the darkness growing inside of you. Do it now, Riley Poe...</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d I whisper out loud, but it\u2019s a weak whisper. The girl\u2019s heartbeat becomes louder, my senses homing in on everything that creates it. With each thump-thump that echoes through my body, desperation builds within me until it reaches such a pitch, I brace myself against the wall to keep from sliding to the sidewalk. I...want it. Need it. Something pulses inside of me, driving me forward.</p><p>Yes, that\u2019s right. You\u2019re weakening, aren\u2019t you, Riley Poe? Save yourself. Go to her...</p><p>My insides are on fire now\u2014a burning that feels as though no amount of water will extinguish the flames. With my stare fixed on the girl, I move slowly forward and silently toward her....</p><p>\u201cThere you are,\u201d Riggs says. \u201cBeen looking for you. Eli\u2019s on fire, so heads up.\u201d</p><p>My eyes focus on Riggs. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I ask.</p> <p>Riggs shrugs, and the light from a nearby post gleams off his dark hair. \u201cHe\u2019s run around the industrial park twice looking for you.\u201d</p><p>Shooting a quick glance left and right, I turn my gaze back to Riggs. Confusion muddles my brain. \u201cI...was right here all along.\u201d</p><p>Riggs walks closer and peers at me with a questioning look. \u201cYou okay, babe?\u201d he says, ducking his head and inspecting my face. \u201cYou look kinda funny.\u201d</p><p>I feel a little spacey, light-headed, but I don\u2019t confess it. \u201cYeah, you always look kinda funny. Where\u2019s Eli?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019ve you been?\u201d Eli says, suddenly beside me.</p><p>I look up into his penetrating stare. In the darkness his eyes all but glow. \u201cThought I saw something. I came right back here.\u201d</p> <p>As if weighing my words, Eli studies me. Concern pinches his brows together and it\u2019s a look that happens more frequently now. \u201cYou didn\u2019t see anything then?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I don\u2019t know what I saw. Everything is a blur to me now.</p><p>Eli pulls me against him with one arm and presses his lips to my temple. \u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d he says quietly. \u201cIt\u2019ll be dawn soon.\u201d His cell vibrates, and he pulls it out of his pocket and lifts it to his ear. \u201cYeah. We were just leaving. Be there in fifteen.\u201d</p><p>With a quick glance at Riggs, then me, Eli takes off. We both fall in behind him. Crossing Highway 21 at the side exit of the industrial park, we slip behind an old run-down oil and lube and hit the woods behind it. We reach the train yard within minutes, find the Jeep and climb in. Eli drives. From my peripheral vision, I can see he silently watches me. I know he\u2019s worried\u2014I am too. I feel like something\u2019s missing, as if I fell asleep and woke up hours later. As we pull onto the service road, I rest my head and stare at the scenery as it flashes by. Quickly, we make our way to Bay Street, then hit Whitaker and take the squares slowly. We see nothing out of the ordinary. When Eli pulls into a parking space next to Forsyth Park, the others are there, waiting. The sun is a thin golden crack, edging through the clouds overhead, and the light surrounding us is hazy. A slight mist hangs low to the ground. Riggs leaps from the back seat over the edge of the Jeep. I use the door.</p><p>Seth immediately comes to me. \u201cYou okay?\u201d he asks, carefully watching me, inspecting my face, my eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, bro,\u201d I lie. \u201cGlad the night\u2019s over though. I\u2019m exhausted.\u201d</p><p>He nods and drapes an arm over my shoulder. \u201cI think I could eat fifty Krystals by myself.\u201d</p><p>I glance sideways at him. \u201cThat has nothing to do with your tendencies, Seth Poe. You could manage that before.\u201d</p> <p>My brother grins at me, and just seeing his warm, smiling face settles me somewhat.</p><p>\u201cAnything unusual?\u201d Phin asks. He\u2019s talking to Eli, but looking at me.</p><p>\u201cJust your average cocky newlings,\u201d Eli responds. \u201cMostly male, a few females. All youth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame with us,\u201d Luc says, and moves to stand next to me. \u201cZetty nearly got his ass beaten by a female.\u201d</p><p>I glance at Zetty. He merely growls.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a place down on the Vernon,\u201d Josie says, leaning against Phin\u2019s truck. She has her hair pulled back into a single braid. \u201cDon\u2019t forget about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Phin says. The hazy early-morning light blends with the porcelain smoothness of his perfect features, which stand in contrast to the darkened area on his jaw that would be a beard, if he let it grow out. \u201cAn old dock house. Pretty big. Looks like several have been staying there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could smell them,\u201d Josie says, and squinches her nose. \u201cNewlings stink.\u201d She regards me silently, her mouth tilts into a grin.</p><p>\u201cYou should\u2019ve seen Riley,\u201d Riggs brags. \u201cShe pulls this wicked-sick leg lock around this newling\u2019s neck.\u201d He throws a proud smile at me. \u201cKick ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you should watch it, worm,\u201d warns Luc, who gives me a wink.</p><p>Traffic begins to move more frequently past the park, and Eli walks over to me. \u201cReady to go?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I say, and I mean it. \u201cI\u2019m tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLater, guys,\u201d Eli says, and we get into the Jeep. Seth walks me around to my side.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see ya later, okay?\u201d he says, and gives me a quick hug. \u201cI\u2019m not too tired and we\u2019re going to work on our project for a while.\u201d Seth inclines his head to Josie.</p><p>Josie shrugs. \u201cMy mother loves to give us school projects. You know, like for science. I think she has us making a volcano soon. And a constellation mobile. I\u2019ve made too many to count in the past but she loves them, even if they sound a little young. I\u2019ve even asked if we can do something cool, like dissect a cow\u2019s eyeball or something. No go. But we\u2019ll study several things with the microscope.\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cSounds good. Catch you guys later,\u201d I say.</p><p>We all part ways; Eli and I head back to Inksomnia.</p><p>As we drive through Savannah\u2019s squares, even the annoying sounds of traffic\u2014horns blowing, people shouting, and somewhere close by, a jackhammer\u2014none of it is able to keep my eyes open. My lids feel heavy, and they drift shut. The sounds around me, even the wind, extinguish. I vaguely recall my body being lifted and carried indoors. Next thing I know, the world around me is pitch black, and I\u2019m dead to everything except the sound of my sluggish heartbeat.</p><p>It\u2019s nighttime, and darkness envelops me. Not just the physical lack of sun, but inside of me is dark, also. As I walk along the sidewalk, it consumes me. I\u2019m like a cat, always on alert to catch something unsuspecting off guard. Play with it for a while. Sink my teeth into it. Kill it.</p><p>What? What the hell was that? I stop in midtracks and look around. The street is empty except for the Savannah Yellow Cab that is parked a few blocks away. The oaks loom overhead; the Spanish moss hangs like wispy gray hair, matted and knotty. Shadows surge from the corners of yards and aged brick homes. I like the darkness, and I like the shadows even more. Menace. That\u2019s what I feel. But why?</p><p>I begin to move again, slowly up the sidewalk toward the cab. I have no intentions at first; I\u2019m just there, a form of life moving through shadows, trying to find my way...somewhere. I guess I have no purpose. But the very instant my eyes lock on the red ember of a lit cigarette flame inside the cab, I know. I am fixated on it now. On what\u2019s inside the cab.</p><p>The regular thump of the heartbeat of the cab driver resonates in my ears. Thump-thump. Thump-thump.</p><p>I have purpose. I have intention.</p><p>A craving roars inside of me. It takes on a life of its own and I am powerless to stop it. Or, I simply don\u2019t want to. The lines are blurred now. I\u2019m confused. This thing inside of me? It pulses. Breathes.</p><p>Possesses.</p><p>I move through the shadows now, closer to the parked cab. Closer to the heartbeat. As I sidle up to the passenger side door, I tap on the window with my index finger.</p><p>The window rolls down.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on a break,\u201d the cab driver says with the cigarette clenched in his lips.</p><p>I smile and lean down to look at him through the window. My hair falls over my shoulder. \u201cFor how long?\u201d</p><p>The cab driver\u2019s eyes dart directly to my low-cut shirt, where his gaze lingers on the swell of my breasts. I allow it. Encourage it by taking a few exaggerated deep breaths. Then, he looks at me and grins. \u201cTill now. Hop in.\u201d</p><p>I grasp the door handle to the backseat and climb in.</p><p>\u201cWhere to?\u201d he asks, looking at me through his rearview mirror. A panel of plastic glass separates us.</p><p>I shrug casually, lean back against the seat, and lock my eyes with his through the mirror. \u201cTybee. North Beach.\u201d</p><p>Again, he grins. \u201cYou got it.\u201d Only now does he flick the cigarette out the window. Then he puts the cab in drive and pulls out onto the street. At Victory, we take a left. We\u2019re both silent until well onto the Island\u2019s Expressway, nearly to North Beach. Silent, but the cab driver\u2019s eyes continuously flicker to the rearview mirror to watch me. Although I\u2019ve looked at him, I can\u2019t tell you what he looks like. I don\u2019t know the color of his eyes, or his skin. I don\u2019t know how old he is. I know only that despite his cigarette smoking, his heart is strong. Damn strong.</p><p>We are just cresting the last bridge. The roads are empty, the night moonless. The tide is high, and the pungent scent of brine lingers heavy in the air. I see a side street edging the marsh. \u201cTake a right,\u201d I say. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The cab driver does as I ask. Along the narrow side street he creeps. The road winds around, hugging the marsh and salt water. We\u2019re now at the back of a few rental houses on stilts. They appear to be empty.</p><p>\u201cStop here,\u201d I say as we near one of the stilt houses overlooking the salt water.</p><p>\u201cNineteen sixty-five,\u201d he says, and half turns in his seat to stare at me. \u201cLong drive from Victory.\u201d Again, his eyes drift to my breasts and linger.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve got it right here,\u201d I say, and then use the power of seduction. I scoot back against the seat, my chest heaving out of my shirt and the cab driver\u2019s eyes glued to it as though he\u2019d never laid eyes on boobs before. Slowly, I ease my fingers to the opening of my shirt, the cabbie all but slobbering on himself. So engrossed with my fingers fumbling so close to my breasts to retrieve what he thinks is cab fare that he doesn\u2019t see what\u2019s really coming. The panel of plastic glass that separates us shatters as I lift my leg and slam my heel against it. The cabbie stares at me in shock, mouth open. With one arm I grab him by his shirt collar and yank him over the seat, right through the remaining shards of plastic glass. In the backseat I straddle him, and for a split second, his eyes lock onto mine and smolder. His cock hardens beneath me, and I almost laugh. The fucker thinks he\u2019s gonna get laid.</p><p>That thing inside of me is free now. My eyes close, my body convulses, but only for a couple of seconds. When next I open my eyes, I see nothing, I feel nothing. I hear only the heartbeat. The sound of blood coursing through veins. It beckons me, unleashes my craving. In one fluid motion I tear away the thin layer of his shirt, and I lunge at his chest. My teeth break through skin, bone, muscle, until I feel a pop, and warm liquid settles against my tongue. I\u2019m in a feeding frenzy now, and the man\u2019s high-pitched screams barely break through my focus.</p><p>Those screams are quickly extinguished.</p><p>My thirst is finally quenched.</p><p>Grabbing his discarded and shredded shirt, I wipe my mouth, my face, and climb off of him. Easing out of the cab, I leave the door open and begin to jog up the winding street hugging the marsh. At the bridge, I break into a run. The briny air whips at my face and hair as my speed picks up to an inhuman pace. That suits me. I\u2019m no longer human anyway, so why fuck with human qualities? I can run like the fucking wind. And I do.</p> <p>As I grow close to Victory Drive, I slow to a boring human pace. My insides soar; a strength I never knew could exist trembles within me. I feel good! Alive! With a quick glance at the oncoming traffic\u2014minimal at this hour but there is a small trail of cars\u2014I hurry across the street and slow to a walk on the sidewalk. Just as I reach the next block, I\u2019m grabbed. A hand encircles my upper arm and I\u2019m yanked to a halt...</p><p>\u201cRiley. Wake up.\u201d A hand on my upper arm shakes me.</p><p>The voice is muffled, and far, far away. I ignore it, shrug off the hand. Exhaustion tugs me under and away from the voice. Am I asleep or walking along a sidewalk? Either way, I want to stay where I am. Not...with this voice.</p><p>\u201cRiley!\u201d This time, the voice and hand speak and shake more violently.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I say grumpily, and crack my eyes open. It takes a few seconds for my vision and mind to clear. I focus on Eli\u2019s face. My eyes scan the room. My room. At Inksomnia. Slowly, I push up onto my elbows, then I sit up.</p><p>Eli lowers himself onto the edge of the bed. With one hand, he pushes the hair from my face and presses his lips to my forehead. When he pulls back and stares at me, I see concern in his eyes.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d I ask. I feel...dirty. Grungy-dirty, like I need a shower.</p><p>Eli\u2019s cerulean blue eyes search mine. \u201cYou can\u2019t know how much I hate not being able to read your thoughts,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat were you just dreaming about? Can you remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know I was dreaming?\u201d I ask, and let my brain settle on before. While I was asleep.</p><p>\u201cYou were thrashing around, mumbling,\u201d he says, and laces his fingers with mine. \u201cYour voice\u2014it didn\u2019t even sound like yours, Ri.\u201d</p><p>I look at Eli, and we study each other for several seconds. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll ever get over how beautiful Eli is. Dark wavy hair sweeps over his forehead, and those blue eyes lock with mine. A strong jaw dusted with dark shade against flawless skin. Perfect facial structure. Perfect period. I exhale, and lean my head back. \u201cAll I can remember is walking along a sidewalk. It was dark outside, and I was alone. Then\u201d\u2014I look at him again\u2014\u201csomeone grabs me from the darkness, and I wake up. Here, with you. Grabbing me.\u201d</p><p>Eli\u2019s stare is intense and bores into me. His gaze drifts to the black angel wings at the corner of my cheek bone. Tracing it lightly with his fingertip, he watches his own movement. Involuntarily, I shiver at the intimacy. Then his eyes return to mine. \u201cI\u2019m worried about you.\u201d</p><p>Unable to break his stare, I nod. \u201cYeah. I know. But honestly, Eli. I\u2019m fine. I can handle myself and you know it.\u201d I glance at my arms, and at the dragon scales inked there. \u201cI\u201d\u2014pasting on a comforting smile, I glance up at him\u2014\u201chave the DNA of not one but two strigoi vampires, plus my own crazy blood. I\u2019m good. Damaged though I might be, I can handle myself perfectly fine, Dupr\u00e9, so stop worrying so much.\u201d I punch his arm. \u201cYou know, not to brag or anything, but I was a bad little ass before I met you. Before all of\u201d\u2014I wave my hand in the air\u2014\u201cthis. So chill.\u201d I lean over and give him a quick peck on the lips. \u201cI mean it.\u201d I move to leave.</p><p>Eli\u2019s fast, and his arm binds my body against him. His profound blue stare nearly makes my heart stop. He studies me, searches my eyes as if trying to see inside my head, my soul. Pulling me to him, he presses his lips against mine, urges them to part and kisses me. Thoroughly. I pull away first.</p> <p>\u201cWhere do you think you\u2019re going, ch\u00e8re,\u201d Eli says, his French accent thick and heavy with lust.</p><p>\u201cI need a shower in a bad, mean way,\u201d I reply, and indulge in a little more of Eli\u2019s kiss before escaping the bed. \u201cHold that thought,\u201d I whisper against his jaw. \u201cBe back in a few.\u201d</p><p>As I leap from the bed, Eli playfully slaps my rump. I shoot him a saucy look and hurry into the shower. As the hot water steams the bathroom and runs down my back, over my face, soaks my hair, a small, teeny slice of normalcy washes over me. When I say small and teeny, I mean just that. Most of the time, I don\u2019t even feel like the same person I was two months ago. Only like now, when I can somehow force myself to forget all the crap, can I feel slightly normal. So, I indulge. I use extra liquid soap with moisturizers that fill the steamy bathroom with the scent of jasmine and honey. I stand beneath the rainfall and close my eyes. Moments pass; how many, I don\u2019t even know or care. My body relaxes, the tense muscles ease.</p><p>Join me, Riley Poe. Although I cannot see you, I can feel you within me. Just as I know you feel me within you. We are one, you and I. While you fight who you truly are...what you\u2019re becoming...I can show you how to embrace it instead. The feeding is only one aspect of our existence, you know. Everything is heightened thereafter. Our scent, our beauty, our lust. We have eternal life, Riley, and the world is at our fingertips. You no longer belong amongst the ordinary. You belong...with me. I know that now...</p><p>\u201cRiley! Damn it, what are you doing?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m cold\u2014frigidly cold. Every bone and muscle in my body aches. I\u2019m shaking, quivering, and it\u2019s unstoppable. That frantic familiar voice sounds far away, and although I feel someone lifting me, carrying me, it doesn\u2019t seem...real. I don\u2019t actually feel skin to skin. It\u2019s more of a numb pressure. Like I\u2019m lacking nerve endings. I can\u2019t even open my eyes. I\u2019m so freaking cold, I just want to sleep...</p><p>A sharp sting spreads across my cheek, and my body viciously shakes.</p><p>\u201cRiley, goddamn it! Wake up!\u201d</p><p>Another sting, more shaking.</p><p>Slowly, I crack my eyes open. Again, I focus on Eli\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re freezing, Riley,\u201d he says, and it\u2019s only then that I notice I\u2019m wet and naked beneath the large bath towel he\u2019s wrapped me in. Vigorously, Eli rubs my arms and legs and abdomen. My teeth chatter.</p><p>Finally, after he all but rubs the first two layers of skin off, Eli tucks me beneath the covers. He\u2019s sitting beside me now, the weight of his body tipping me toward him. With one hand, he grasps my face and tilts it upward.</p><p>\u201cWhere were you?\u201d he asks. \u201cI\u2019m not being overprotective. I\u2019m not being nosy or obsessive. I\u2019m genuinely worried about you, and something\u2019s not right, Riley. So, please\u2014where did you go?\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s a weird question. Even weirder that I don\u2019t have the answer. \u201cI was here, with you,\u201d I respond.</p><p>\u201cAnd then?\u201d Eli continues.</p><p>I think a moment. \u201cI went to take a shower.\u201d</p><p>Eli studies me. \u201cYou don\u2019t remember going outside?\u201d</p><p>I concentrate. Hard. Then I look at Eli. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s where I found you, Ri,\u201d he said, pushing my damp hair off my face. \u201cIn the alley between Inksomnia and Bhing\u2019s store. What were you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaked?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cYes, like you\u2019d walked straight out of the shower and out the door. You were huddled against the wall. Mumbling. Eyes wide open.\u201d</p><p>Slowly, I shake my head. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t even make sense.\u201d</p><p>With both hands, Eli rubs my arms. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk about it later. Warming up?\u201d he asks.</p><p>I look at him. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine. Where,\u201d I say, and search his eyes, \u201cwere you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d fallen asleep, Riley,\u201d he answers. \u201cYou were gone when I woke up.\u201d His eyes are grave. \u201cThree hours, Ri.\u201d</p><p>I stare off across the room. How can that be? \u201cHow can I lose that much time, Eli?\u201d I say. Something has to give, and I mean now. What the freak is happening to me?</p><p>Eli leans over and kisses my forehead. Pulling back, his eyes search mine. \u201cI don\u2019t know, but I\u2019m going to figure it out, Ri.\u201d He strokes my hair. \u201cYour behavior is different. Your demeanor. It\u2019s why I always seem to be so in-your-face. I\u2019m worried. We\u2019ll go to my father. He\u2019ll know what to do. Meanwhile, you need some nutrients. Want something to eat?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I say, and climb from the covers, pull on sweats and a black long-sleeved Inksomnia T-shirt and a pair of thick wooly socks, and walk to the living room. I\u2019m really not all that hungry now. I\u2019m losing chunks of time, and that scares the hell out of me. I hope Gilles can help. What if I\u2019m killing innocents? Who\u2019s going to stop me? Vic said he could help. But can he? Or is he just trying to change me? Make me his forever. I wouldn\u2019t put it past him. What did I do all that time? Outside, naked. Freaking naked! Goddamn almighty. I start for the kitchen, and Eli stops me.</p><p>\u201cNon,\u201d he says, slipping into French. \u201cI got this. You chill on the sofa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEli, really,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019m not a baby. Or an invalid. As a matter of fact I can almost kick your ass.\u201d</p> <p>He says nothing. The look, though, speaks volumes.</p><p>I sigh. \u201cWhatever.\u201d I move to the sofa, plop down, and grab the remote. \u201cThank you,\u201d I say. I don\u2019t like to be pampered and he knows it.</p><p>Eli simply grins.</p><p>Flipping on the TV, I turn to the local channel to check out the news. It\u2019s noon and something should be on.</p><p>Then, suddenly, there is. The news.</p> <p>\u201c...the driver\u2019s mutilated body was found in his cab along the marsh on North Beach, at Tybee. It appears to be unrelated to the string of burglaries in the area. Tybee police have no leads as of now,\u201d the news affiliate said.</p><p>My insides grow cold. Hadn\u2019t I dreamed that? Oh freaking hell, had I actually been there? It seems too familiar, too...close. I stand and walk to the window, move the drapes and look out over River Street. No way could I have attacked someone. Mutilated someone.</p><p>\u201cRi.\u201d</p><p>Eli is behind me. So quiet, I hadn\u2019t even heard him move. I should be used to it by now, but I\u2019m not. Maybe I never will be.</p><p>His arms go around my waist and pull me against his body, and his mouth nuzzles my neck. Funny how that doesn\u2019t even remotely frighten me. \u201cI know you\u2019re tired of it all,\u201d Eli says in a low, crooning French accent. \u201cThe killing. The death. Hopefully soon, it\u2019ll all be over. You can\u2019t let it get to you, though.\u201d He pulls me tightly against him. \u201cYou\u2019re strong, Riley. One of the strongest humans I\u2019ve ever known. So\u201d\u2014he kissed my throat\u2014\u201cfight it.\u201d</p><p>I relax against Eli\u2019s strong embrace, but inside, I\u2019m cold. Numb. And I almost take pride that I hide it so well now. Before, I couldn\u2019t hide a damn thing. Eli could read my every thought. Now? With the DNA of two strigoi mixed with my own? Eli\u2019s oblivious. He has no clue that it isn\u2019t the fighting of vampires and finding of dead bodies that torments me now.</p> <p>It\u2019s the fact that I may be the one hunting them.</p><p>Stranger still, I find that tormented isn\u2019t exactly the right way to describe my feelings about possibly being a killer.</p><p>It\u2019s more like...</p><p>Aroused...</p><p>Part Four</p><p>UNHINGED</p><p>I\u2019m starting to seriously dig this feeling I have inside of me. Makes me feel alive. Mysterious. Kick-ass. I crave something, and it\u2019s strong, powerful, and pulls at me with a force I never knew existed. I don\u2019t even know what the hell it is, but I want it. Bad. Don\u2019t forget\u2014I\u2019ve had these cravings before. I used to be an addict, and this feels the same. Sometimes I feel like my insides are turning outside, every nerve ending is on fire, and that if I don\u2019t get whatever it is I\u2019m craving, I will go totally insane. But you know what\u2019s starting to piss me off? Everything. And everyone. Eli. Luc. Phin. Josie. Seth. Zetty. Preacher. Estelle. Nyx. Irritating as shit, every one of them. Constantly watching me\u2014especially Eli. I can barely have any time to my freaking self. You know what I want? I want everyone to leave me the fuck alone.</p><p>\u2014Riley Poe</p> <p>Everything\u2019s changed. Me. Them. All that\u2019s around me. Complete chaos. And I don\u2019t even think they can see it. At least, they don\u2019t see what I see.</p><p>And that\u2019s fine by me.</p><p>They all look at me funny, and that\u2019s something I don\u2019t like. I\u2019m trying not to make a big deal about it, but it\u2019s starting to grate on my last everfucking nerve. I don\u2019t know how much more I can stand. Always watching. Always talking. Planning shit behind my back. Someone\u2019s always with me. Acting like I don\u2019t have a fucking brain in my head to make decisions with.</p><p>And Eli\u2019s eyes are constantly locked on to me.</p><p>Sometimes I feel like I\u2019m losing my goddamn mind.</p><p>I\u2019ve gotten good at hiding it though, and trust me when I say that\u2019s a plus. If they all knew what really went on inside my head they\u2019d lock me away. But I didn\u2019t make it through drug rehab and vamp rehab to break down now. No, hell-sir no. I got it. I\u2019m cool.</p><p>I\u2019m blankly staring at images as I sift through the pile of sketches Nyx handed me an hour ago. Dragons. Japanese symbols. Japanese symbols with dragons. Japanese symbols with flowers. Skull with a Ranger\u2019s beret.</p><p>\u201cHey, Riley,\u201d Nyx says from her station.</p><p>I glance at her and she\u2019s smiling ear to ear. It irritates me. \u201cYeah?\u201d I answer.</p><p>\u201cYour ten-thirty appointment just called. They\u2019re running a few minutes late.\u201d</p><p>Damn. I hadn\u2019t even heard the phone ring. \u201cThanks,\u201d I say.</p><p>Just then the front door opens, and that raven above the jamb caws loudly. Swear to God, I\u2019m going to yankthat fucker off the wall and throw it in the river next time I get the chance.</p><p>\u201cRiley? This guy wants to talk to you,\u201d Nyx says. She gives me another smile, all bright and cheery. Like nothing\u2019s wrong with the world.</p><p>I set the sketches aside and walk over to the man waiting for me. He\u2019s young, military, and gives me a nod and a wide smile. \u201cMa\u2019am,\u201d he offers politely as a greeting. \u201cI was told I could get inked by no one other than you.\u201d</p><p>Thump, thump.</p><p>The soldier\u2019s young, vibrant heartbeat echoed inside my head.</p><p>I smile up at him. \u201cYou got something in mind?\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s warm enough inside the shop that I\u2019m wearing a black Inksomnia tank, a pair of jeans and combat boots. The soldier checks out the dragons inked on my arms and smiles. \u201cSweet,\u201d he says, continuing to admire the work. Or me. \u201cI was thinking of a snake wrapped around my arm,\u201d he says, \u201cfrom here to here.\u201d He points at his shoulder and elbow. \u201cWith my infantry number in the body.\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cI\u2019m booked today, but check out the album over there\u201d\u2014I nod toward the image album on the coffee table\u2014\u201cand see if there\u2019s anything in there you like. I\u2019ll do a fast mock sketch and see what you think. Then we\u2019ll set you up with an appointment.\u201d</p><p>Soldier nods. \u201cCool.\u201d He turns, finds the album, and plants himself on the sofa and begins his search.</p><p>I return to my station and pick up the sketches. In the back, I notice Eli leaning against the wall. Watching.</p><p>I ignore him and continue on with my meaningless task. I can\u2019t believe I sit around and draw such stupid shit. God, the things people think they want inked forever into their skin. They are fucking clueless. Then, I\u2019m interrupted.</p><p>Vic: It\u2019s getting worse for you, isn\u2019t it, love?</p><p>Me: Get out of my head, Victorian. I don\u2019t want to hear it.</p><p>Vic: A piece of me lives inside of you, Riley. You cannot fool me. I can sense the mayhem. What else is happening?</p><p>Me: Nothing I can\u2019t handle.</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Vic: Has my brother been contacting you?</p><p>Me: Maybe. Not really sure who it is. Or if they\u2019re real. Like I said, I can handle it. Doin\u2019 a fan-fucking-tastic time of it so far.</p><p>Vic: Riley.</p><p>Me: I\u2019m losing chunks of time. They feel like dreams really, but then I physically realize I have lost time. Can\u2019t remember what I\u2019ve done, yet some things seem familiar.</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Vic: Christ, Riley. Let me help you before it\u2019s too late. Please. I will take such good care of you. You\u2019ll want or desire nothing, I vow it. I can give you such love, such pleasures, if you\u2019ll only allow me to take you away.</p><p>Me: (laughing) Vic, you know I can\u2019t allow that. No way am I leaving.</p><p>Vic: It\u2019s taking you over, love. It will overpower you and there will be nothing left of the Riley Poe you know. It\u2019s very close to succeeding even now. Please. Come with me. I am begging you.</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Me: Good-bye, Victorian. Leave me alone.</p><p>Vic: I will never leave you alone, Riley. Never. At least allow me a decent good-bye.</p><p>Me: What do you mean by that?</p><p>Vic: Meet me. Tonight. I won\u2019t ask for another thing from you. I vow it.</p><p>Me: You do realize your mind whammy doesn\u2019t work on me anymore, right?</p><p>Vic: Unfortunately, yes. I do realize. I only want to say good-bye.</p><p>Me: Yeah, right. Where do you want to meet?</p><p>Vic: I\u2019m just across the river from you, love. At the Westin. Tower Suite.</p><p>Me: (laughing) Of course the tower suite. I\u2019ll be there.</p><p>Vic: What time?</p><p>Me: When I get there.</p><p>\u201cMa\u2019am?\u201d</p><p>My eyes focus on the young soldier who is now standing in front of me, grinning.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d I say.</p><p>His face falls slightly, but he clears his throat and continues. He holds open a page in the sketches album. \u201cI found the one.\u201d Leaning closer, he shows me.</p><p>A winding serpent. I\u2019d sketched it in under ten minutes. \u201cYou sure?\u201d I say.</p><p>The soldier nods and answers without hesitation. \u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I answer, get up and move to the computer up front. I click on the appointments screen and scroll down. \u201cI can fit you in on Friday at five p.m.\u201d</p><p>The soldier smiles. \u201cSounds great. I\u2019ll be here.\u201d</p><p>I click in his appointment, calling him \u201csoldier/snake,\u201d and close the screen. Then without another glance or thought, I get up and walk to my station.</p><p>I\u2019d forgotten Eli was even in the shop. But he was. Hadn\u2019t even moved from where I last saw him. I ignore him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My clients come and go throughout the day. I don\u2019t make much conversation. I do the art, and get done quickly. The sound of heartbeats rush through my head with such vigor, I have to really concentrate to block them out. Which, in turn, blocks everything else out and that\u2019s fine by me, too. None of it\u2019s easy though. Along with the thumping of heartbeats comes a thrill I can\u2019t explain, and it shakes my whole body on the inside. I\u2019m on edge, and I want to be alone. Vaguely do I recall inking a set of broken skeletal wings on the back of a very bony girl in her mid-twenties. That took a couple of hours. Staring at her back lined with drops of blood didn\u2019t do much for my mood. But some small slice of my pride must still exist because in the end, despite all of the frustrations and distractions, my work still kicks ass. Call it vanity. Call it whatever the fuck you want.</p><p>I am just finishing up a Japanese verse on the flank of a young guy when Preacher walks in through the front door, followed by Eli\u2019s brothers, sister, and Seth. My insides twinge; I haven\u2019t seen Preacher and Estelle in a week maybe? I\u2019ve lost track. My surrogate grandfather, wearing his signature plaid button-up long-sleeved shirt and jeans, catches my glance and holds it. I feel cold all of a sudden, and the hairs rise on my arms. Preacher\u2019s eyes lock on to mine for several seconds, as if digging in my brain to find something. I feel like he\u2019s busting me for smoking weed. He turns, and I can tell something\u2019s up.</p><p>\u201cEligius?\u201d Preacher calls.</p> <p>Eli emerges from the back of the shop. \u201cYes, sir?\u201d He slides me a glance as he passes. His presence takes up the entire area. I forget he has that ability sometimes. Power. He reeks of it.</p><p>The old Gullah merely stares at Eli for several seconds; Eli returns the look. Without saying a word out loud, both leave Inksomnia, Luc and Phin following. Their expressions are unreadable.</p><p>I guess there\u2019s enough of the old pathetic me left to actually care to ask, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>Josie and Seth walk toward me. Josie watches me with depth. Precision. Weighs me. Large, cerulean blue eyes unblinking. But keeps silent.</p><p>Seth stops in front of me. His green eyes are solemn. \u201cOne of Capote\u2019s nieces was killed last night.\u201d Capote is an old Gullah, and Preacher\u2019s cousin. Plays a wicked saxophone, too.</p> <p>\u201cKilled?\u201d I ask. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>Seth and Josie simply stare at me. No words. No explanation. Then, I know. I realize it means only one thing.</p><p>Vampires.</p><p>I meet their stare for several seconds, then return to what I\u2019d been doing in silence.</p><p>\u201cOh, gosh,\u201d Nyx says quietly. I glance at her. Now she\u2019s wringing her hands and pacing, her face pinched in worry. The beat of her heart increases. \u201cHow awful. Poor Capote.\u201d I think for a second Nyx is going to burst into tears.</p><p>Of course, Capote and Preacher are cousins, so the girl is related to Preacher as well.</p> <p>A vampire killed a Gullah. This hasn\u2019t happened in centuries, save Eli\u2019s accident. The Dupr\u00e9s have always kept Savannah and Preacher\u2019s kin safe. Valerian\u2019s army is growing. Now, a young Gullah girl has been murdered.</p><p>What if I did it?</p><p>I continue cleaning my station until I feel a hand on my shoulder. When I glance up, it\u2019s Seth\u2019s eyes I\u2019m staring into. \u201cWhat?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cCan we talk?\u201d he replies. \u201cAlone.\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cFine by me. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Seth\u2019s eyes lock on to mine for several seconds, then he turns and heads to the back of the shop. Nyx must be on a retro kick because she changes the tunes and The Monkees\u2019 \u201cDaydream Believer\u201d blasts through Inksomnia and follows me upstairs.</p><p>I walk straight to the fridge, open the door, and grab a beer. I\u2019ve got half the bottle drained by the time Seth speaks.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d he asks, and he doesn\u2019t ask it nicely.</p> <p>I stare at him as I drain the rest of the bottle. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>Seth rakes both hands through his hair and then grasps his neck. For a moment, he closes his eyes. When he reopens them, his stare is hard. Hurtful. To him, not me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not the same, Ri,\u201d he begins. \u201cYou\u2019re...different. Hateful. Mean.\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cNo shit, bro. I\u2019ve got two fucking sets of strigoi DNA inside me.\u201d I shake my head. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d I\u2019m irritated now. He called me up here for this?</p><p>\u201cI watched your face when I told you about Capote\u2019s niece,\u201d he says angrily. \u201cYour expression didn\u2019t even flinch, Ri. It\u2019s like you don\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still a kid, Seth. What do you know? Grow up and have some responsibilities and then tell me about my lack of care and expression, okay?\u201d I answer.</p><p>Just then the door swings open and Eli walks in. His gaze sweeps over me and Seth. \u201cAm I interrupting?\u201d he asks.</p><p>Seth shakes his head and keeps his eyes on me. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>The silence inside the apartment is a live, palpable entity.</p><p>Eli walks to me and grasps my shoulders. \u201cI have to go with Preacher and my brothers to Da Island,\u201d he says quietly, evenly. \u201cI hate leaving you, but this is unavoidable. Did Seth tell you what happened?\u201d</p><p>I simply nod.</p><p>Eli grasps my chin and tilts my face to look up into his. \u201cI hate leaving. I hate that Phin, Luc, and my father have to go, too, but we do. This is big. And it has to stop.\u201d</p><p>Again, I nod and remain silent.</p><p>\u201cMy mother and Josie will be here. Seth, Zetty, and Riggs, as well.\u201d He lowers his mouth to mine and kisses me. When he lifts his head, those cerulean blue eyes almost take my breath away with their intensity. They nearly pierce the anger subtly bubbling below the surface of my being. \u201cFor now, the night runs stop, and I mean that, Riley. It\u2019s too dangerous to go out alone. You\u2019re strong but not against a dozen newlings. Wait for us to return.\u201d He kisses me again. \u201cThey\u2019re waiting for me. I\u2019ll be back soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye,\u201d I say, and with a final glance, he leaves. Fast. I follow him to the door but he\u2019s already gone.</p><p>\u201cListen to him, Ri,\u201d Seth says, and he\u2019s closer to me now. Like right behind me, crowding my space. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s up with you lately, but please.\u201d He grabs my arm. \u201cListen for once.\u201d</p><p>I snatch my arm from Seth\u2019s grasp and glare at him. His sluggish heartbeat resonates in my head. \u201cI don\u2019t need you telling me what to do, Seth. So chill the hell out and stop talking to me like I\u2019m a kid.\u201d</p><p>Seth\u2019s face falls. Blanches, even. Suddenly, he\u2019s seven years old again and looking at me as I trip and fall up the steps to our apartment. Drunk. I vaguely remember those days. But I totally remember his expression. I\u2019m not sure why it doesn\u2019t affect me, but it doesn\u2019t. I turn and head for my room.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019re you going?\u201d Seth calls after me.</p><p>I don\u2019t look at him. \u201cI need to work out,\u201d I say, step into my room, and shut the door.</p><p>Minutes later, I hear the apartment door open and close. Finally, alone.</p><p>Nervous energy simmers under my skin, and for a split second I feel as though I\u2019m on fire. I claw and peel out of all my clothes except my bra and panties. Without bothering with a warm-up, I start kicking the bag suspended from the corner ceiling of my bedroom. I kick. I punch the bag, and I don\u2019t know how long I go at it, but it\u2019s a while. I don\u2019t even break a sweat. The exertion only helps a little. My thoughts are running ninety to nothing, my brain suddenly unable to filter out the constant rumbling of human noises outside the apartment. My head begins to throb. Mercilessly. Voices. Heartbeats. Crying. Traffic. The pain is so bad it sends shards of light shooting behind my eyelids. I gotta run. Gotta get out.</p><p>No, first watch this. Watch what you could be...</p><p>I jerk my head around and scan the room. I\u2019m alone. The voice. It\u2019s familiar. Frightening. I sit on the floor and cradle my head in my hands, and only then does the vision appear behind my eyes. It\u2019s dark. I\u2019m running away. No, I\u2019m chasing. Someone. Wait, not chasing. Stalking. They\u2019re unaware of me. I slip through the shadows silently, yet I run. I want to get closer. I can already smell their scent. Hear their heartbeat. Almost feel the rush of their blood through their veins. I\u2019m on Savannah\u2019s dark side, away from the tourists, away from the history, the moss, the charm. I\u2019m where most people wouldn\u2019t dare go alone. Up ahead, the figure turns the corner. I\u2019m right behind them. The moment I turn the corner I\u2019m coldcocked by a heavy fist, and I land square on my ass. Warm liquid spills over my lip and onto my chin.</p><p>\u201cDamn, bitch,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat the fuck\u2019s your problem? You a cop?\u201d</p><p>I stare up at the guy in silence. I\u2019m seething.</p><p>\u201cDeke, man,\u201d another guy says as he steps out of the building\u2019s front door. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis bitch was followin\u2019 me,\u201d he says. \u201cI think she\u2019s a cop.\u201d</p><p>The other one lets the screen door slam and walks over to me. He studies me for a moment. Looks at my ink. \u201cNaw, man,\u201d he says. \u201cThat bitch ain\u2019t nothin\u2019 but that. A bitch. She ain\u2019t no cop.\u201d He shoves me with his foot. \u201cYou ain\u2019t no coppy, are ya, bitch?\u201d</p><p>He lifts his foot to shove me again. It never touches me. I grab it, midair, and with very little effort, send him flying backward into the shadows beside the duplex. I\u2019m so fast that the other guy doesn\u2019t have time to react before I\u2019m in the shadows with the first guy. In the darkness, I have his body pinned to the ground. I see only the whites of his eyes, the flare of fear in his nostrils. His mouth opens to shout for help, out of surprise, whatever. The words die on his tongue. Because he dies on my tongue.</p><p>My fangs sink deep into his throat. His body thrashes, then slows to erratic jerks as his nervous system detects failure.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck!\u201d his friend calls from behind me.</p><p>I leap upward, grab his shoulder, and swing onto his back, my legs wrapped around his waist, my arms tightening around his neck. His strength gives out and we tumble to the damp mossy ground. Before a single word escapes him, my fangs are buried in his heart. A deep, sadistic laugh reverberates off the trees and dingy buildings around me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Just as fast as the vision appeared, it vanishes. I lose my breath for a second, and I choke. The sensation I\u2019d had moments earlier seems so real. I blink, look around. I\u2019m back in my room, in my apartment above Inksomnia. Why am I being tormented? Rising from the floor, I breathe. What was that? Was it real? I\u2019m so confused, and the pounding inside my head returns. Quickly, I grab a pair of discarded jeans thrown across the back of a chair, a long-sleeved T-shirt, and boots and hurry out of my bedroom. I pass by Chaz, lying on his bed close to the hearth. He stares at me, lowers his head, and growls low in his throat.</p><p>I spare him the slightest of glares and leave the apartment. In seconds I am just another body slipping through the streets of Savannah.</p><p>The night air is chillier than it has been. I\u2019ve been on the streets for hours, and I find myself in a half-packed parking lot of some random club. I don\u2019t recognize it, but that\u2019s nothing new. Clubs pop up all over Savannah, and they close just as fast. In some weird extraterrestrial font, the bar sign reads AREA 51.</p> <p>The club is just a plain gray building with no windows, and from the smell of extreme marsh and brine hanging on the breeze, I guess it\u2019s close to the river. The scent is nauseating today, and I choke back a gag. I feel like I\u2019m chewing on mucky saw grass. I make my way to the front door. Just as I reach it, a couple steps out. Chick. Dude. I don\u2019t see faces, features. Only silhouettes. I step inside.</p><p>Bodies. Heartbeats. Laughter. Some cosmic weird tunes echoing off the walls\u2014almost like the sounds a supposed spaceship would make. Some dude pushes by me. His T-shirt says THEY ARE OUT THERE.</p><p>\u201cHey gorgeous,\u201d some guy says beside me. \u201cYou look lost. Want a drink?\u201d</p><p>I glance at him wordlessly.</p><p>The guy chuckles, and his eyes divert to the ink on my cheek. His gaze travels down to my hands, where only the tail of my dragon wraps around my fingers, then back to my face. \u201cSweet tats.\u201d He glances at my shirt. \u201cSo what does Inksomnia mean?\u201d</p> <p>I lean in close, and his nostrils flare with male hormones. \u201cIt means fuck off,\u201d I say sweetly, blink, and move back. My gaze locks on to his. The thump of his fast-paced heart resonates inside my head. I can almost feel the blood rushing through his veins. My mouth waters. Maybe I shouldn\u2019t rush him away.</p><p>\u201cHey Aaron, come on,\u201d another guy says behind him, grabbing his arm. \u201cWe\u2019re late, man.\u201d The guy flashes me a shy smile. I think I scare him.</p><p>Aaron is transfixed. He can\u2019t move and his stare is locked on to mine in fascination. I lick my lips, and I watch his pupils dilate. Goddamn. I don\u2019t even have to say anything. Ole Aaron is ready to screw my brains out right here and now. It wouldn\u2019t take much, and this game is just too...invigorating. Powerful. I haven\u2019t even been in the club for fifteen friggin\u2019 minutes.</p><p>\u201cAaron, man,\u201d his friend urges, avoiding my glare. \u201cCome on.\u201d</p><p>I lean in very close to Aaron, and my lips brush the shell of his ear. \u201cYour loss,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>Aaron\u2019s eyes widen as his friend pulls him through the crowd and away from me.</p> <p>My eyes immediately scan the crowd. Searching. Seeking...something.</p><p>\u201cIs that what you\u2019re into?\u201d a voice says close to me. \u201cGeeks?\u201d</p><p>I turn and look up. Brown hair. Brown eyes. Lean build. Sluggish heartbeat.</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d I answer, and lean closer. \u201cI\u2019m into a lot of things.\u201d</p><p>The stranger\u2019s pupils dilate, just a fraction.</p><p>Just then, a siren goes off overhead, followed by an announcement over a loudspeaker. When I search the room, I notice some guy wearing a THE TRUTH IS OUT THERE T-shirt and a big goofy-ass grin standing at the mic. \u201cWe\u2019ve had another sighting! This one near Mobile, Alabama, and more than twelve people saw the lights!\u201d</p><p>A huge roar went through the crowd as they cheer. I can\u2019t help but glance around at the people packed into the club.</p><p>\u201cAre you fucking kidding me?\u201d I mutter.</p> <p>A large hand skims my hip. \u201cYou wanna leave?\u201d the guy says against my ear. \u201cWith me?\u201d</p><p>I brush his stomach with my fingertips. Not an ounce of fat. Nothing but rigid muscle. \u201cHell, yeah,\u201d I say in a low voice. \u201cAnd don\u2019t make me beg.\u201d</p><p>The stranger stares at me for a moment, grins, then grasps my hand. I allow him to lead me through the crowd of X-Files dorks and to the front door. We push out into the night, and I only vaguely notice it\u2019s warmer than usual. Warm and muggy, as though rain is close, hanging in the air. Threatening.</p><p>I like threatening.</p><p>The swoosh of his blood through his veins echoes inside my head. I hear it. Feel it.</p><p>Taste it.</p><p>And goddamn, I want it.</p><p>We\u2019re walking beneath the shadows of the overhanging oaks now, and in midstride the stranger stops, turns, and slides his hands over my hips, pulling me against him. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d he asks seductively. His fingers trail up my ribs. In the darkness, I can\u2019t see anything but his silhouette.</p><p>As I stare at him, a blank, hollow feeling washes over me. Forcing my brain to concentrate, I think. It\u2019s no use. I\u2019m empty. Tapped out. In other words, I have no fucking clue who I am. Why can\u2019t I remember my own name? I look around me as if I expect my name to be written on something, like the trunk of a tree, the side of a building. I see nothing. I know even less.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d the guy says, leaning his head close to mine. I am still staring at him, but blankly. After a few moments, his features focus. \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d He begins to walk backward, pulling me along. \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter.\u201d He stops, turns, and backs me against a moss-covered brick wall. It\u2019s dark. No lights. A few sparse drops of rain fall through the canopy of oak. The scent of brine and wet vegetation permeates the air. The stranger lowers his head and kisses me.</p><p>I kiss him back.</p><p>Unfamiliar hands slide up my stomach and over my breasts, and I moan and push into him. We kiss, grope, touch until we\u2019re both breathless. He rests his forehead against mine. \u201cWanna go for a ride?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know who I am. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing. I want something. And it\u2019s something he\u2019s not going to want to freely give. I\u2019ll have to take it.</p><p>I will take it.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I say breathily. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>I see a white flash in the darkness, and it\u2019s the stranger\u2019s smile. Without words, he pulls me away from the wall and leads me down the sidewalk, around the corner to a row of historic townhomes. On the street, a motorcycle is parked. He pulls me toward it and hands me the spare helmet strapped to the back.</p><p>As I pull the helmet onto my head, a vague familiarity washes over me. I\u2019ve done this before. With this guy? Another? Whatever, I\u2019ve done it enough that I don\u2019t even hesitate. The stranger eases onto the bike, I slide on behind him and wrap my arms around his waist. In moments we are on some street, heading in some direction or another. I don\u2019t really know or care.</p><p>In the end, what I want will be waiting there. Away from the crowd. In private.</p><p>I lean against the stranger\u2019s back as we ride, and I feel his heart beating against me. A craving gnaws at me, stirs something feral within me that is almost uncontrollable. I slowly lower my hands from his waist to his crotch, and the hard bulge I find lets me know he\u2019s ready for me.</p><p>Only, he\u2019s not. He\u2019s so fucking not.</p><p>His hand leaves one handlebar and covers mine, pressing mine hard against his cock. I can feel anticipation, smell his pheromones, and hear his heart rate increase.</p><p>I wait. We continue.</p><p>Down a winding two-lane road we travel, and I\u2019ve no idea where we are. Huge mossy oaks drape the street, and we\u2019re hugging tight curves and the river as we go. The bike speeds up, dangerous, reckless, and I find myself liking the feeling.</p><p>After one more curve the bike slows and veers right; we pull into a long oyster-shell drive. A small, older concrete house on the river sits beneath several trees, and a long front porch lies open to air. All is dark, save the single yard light high on a power pole. It casts shadows that dance and play with the slight breeze rolling in off the marsh.</p><p>The sexual energy literally rolls off of the stranger. I have to wonder if he would be as turned on if he knew I could snap his head off like a dandelion bloom.</p><p>I dismount the bike, and he does the same. Immediately, he pulls me to him. Hungrily, his mouth takes mine, his hands move over my ass, up my spine, and the whole while he\u2019s touching me, kissing me, I notice\u2014feel\u2014one thing: his heart. I smell one thing: his blood.</p><p>The more frantic he becomes, the more ravenous I grow.</p><p>He\u2019s groping me now, through my jeans, pressing his hard cock against me. Somehow, we\u2019re on the porch, and the only sounds are the rush of air through the trees, his heartbeat, and his excited, breathless groans as I press my hand against his stiff ridge. It\u2019s all a game. To me, anyway. It\u2019s the only way I can get what I want. What I need.</p><p>But I can\u2019t take any more. Not one more fucking second. His blood rushes with each pump of his heart, and it\u2019s so intense it resonates literally inside my head. Taunting me. Begging me. My head begins to pound, my mouth waters. Shards of light intrude behind my eyes as the pain intensifies, and suddenly, I no longer feel his hands on me. I see him though, barely, and through my fog of delirium, I lunge. We struggle. He screams. All is silent.</p><p>A suffocating black shadow of agony swallows me whole.</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Riley, wake up!\u201d</p><p>Hands on me. Loud voices. I jerk my eyes open and stare, pissed off and confused. In one fluid motion I leap, shove the hands off me, and dart to the corner of the room. So fast is the movement that I barely feel my feet hit the floor. Only now, at the far end of the room, does my vision clear and I see the kid standing beside the bed.</p><p>A boy. Dark hair. Lean. Tall. Looks familiar. My brain strains, trying to remember.</p><p>My brother.</p><p>\u201cRi, what\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d he asks. Worry laces each word.</p><p>Slowly, I take in the room. It\u2019s my bedroom. I\u2019m in my apartment. Confusion webs my brain like a cocoon. Bits and pieces of memory filter in. \u201cI, uh,\u201d I stutter. \u201cHad a bad dream, bro. That\u2019s all. You scared the hell out of me.\u201d I want to be alone, want him to go away. But there he stands, looking at me. His brows pinch together in concern. I\u2019m sick of him worrying about me so much. It\u2019s starting to get on my last fucking nerve. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Seth moves toward me. \u201cYou\u2019ve been knocked out for almost twenty-four hours,\u201d he says.</p><p>I glance around the room. How did I lose that much time? \u201cI must be coming down with something,\u201d I say. \u201cProbably the flu. I feel like shit.\u201d I blink. \u201cIs Eli still gone?\u201d</p><p>Seth\u2019s eyes rake over me. Weighing me. Considering my words. \u201cYeah, they\u2019re still on Da Island with Preacher. Maybe you\u2019d better see a doctor, sis. You\u2019re scaring me.\u201d</p> <p>A cynical laugh escapes me. \u201cYeah, right. A doctor. That\u2019s what normal people do, Seth.\u201d I give him a hard look and push away from the wall. \u201cWe\u2019re not that anymore. Never will be, either. I\u2019ll just sleep it off.\u201d I throw myself back onto the bed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got clients waiting,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cLater,\u201d I mumble into my pillow. \u201cTired.\u201d</p><p>A few seconds go by. I feel Seth\u2019s hand on my head, stroking my hair. \u201cCome on, Ri. Get up. Please\u2014\u201d</p><p>In less than a half second, I turn over and shove him away. Hard. \u201cGet away from me, Seth,\u201d I say angrily. \u201cI fucking mean it. Leave me alone.\u201d My vision is fogging again, and I feel myself being pulled into blackness. I fight it, though, and keep my stare trained on my brother.</p> <p>Hurt and anger crowd Seth\u2019s young features. \u201cI\u2019ll never leave you alone,\u201d he says with ferocity, then does exactly that and storms out of my room. In seconds I hear the apartment door downstairs slam shut.</p><p>Without another thought I turn over and fall right back to sleep. Or, into the pit of darkness. What the fuck ever. Doesn\u2019t matter anymore. Shadows claim me, my thoughts, my memory. I\u2019m aware of my own life force, the echo of my sluggish heart beating, but of nothing around me. Once more, I\u2019m starkly oblivious. I like it like that.</p><p>I\u2019m at a party. A ball? A charity? Everyone\u2019s in tuxes and evening gowns, me included. Must be something big. Can\u2019t imagine why I\u2019m here. With a furtive glance, I check out my dress in the mirror I\u2019m standing next to. Long, form fitting, garnet, thin jeweled straps and a plunging neckline. Backless. Slit from the floor to my thigh. Black peep-toe heels. The only jewelry I wear is a garnet velvet choker with a black stone inset. My hair is pulled up into a loose sort of sexy something, and someone curled my hair leaving long, spiraling hanks of midnight and fuchsia. The makeup is a little heavy, with my lips as garnet as my dress. I barely even look like me, except for the ink. My dual dragons running the length of my arms look wickedly out of place here. I like that.</p><p>A man appears beside me in the mirror, and I stare as he glides close to me. I\u2019ve no idea who he is. Hell. I have no idea who I am.</p><p>\u201cYou came,\u201d he says excitedly.</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d I say, and I check him out from head to toe. A little young, but gorgeous all the same. Tall. Dark hair. Dark eyes. Perfectly structured face. \u201cBut that could change.\u201d</p> <p>He blinks in surprise, then gives me a seductive smile and offers me his arm. \u201cLet\u2019s dance.\u201d Inclining his head, his grin widens.</p><p>I shrug and accept. \u201cLead the way.\u201d</p><p>He does, and we make our way through a crowd of tuxes and gowns twirling around the dance floor to the music of a live orchestra. Once in the middle, he slows, turns, pulls me close, and immediately and with more grace than I credit him for, begins an unhurried, intimate dance. I let him lead, and I meet his gaze. His brown eyes sear into mine and he studies me with a burning, curious intensity.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know who I am, do you?\u201d he inquires. The hand resting modestly against my back moves lower, urges me closer with the slightest of nudges. His fingers interlace with mine. His whole presence exudes seduction. He\u2019s very male. Very determined. And very, very horny.</p><p>\u201cNot a clue,\u201d I finally answer. \u201cBut you seem to know who I am.\u201d</p><p>Brown eyes soften as he looks at me, and he smiles wide. \u201cLet\u2019s pretend neither of us knows the other,\u201d he suggests. His accent is...I can\u2019t place it. But it\u2019s unusual, and sexy as hell. \u201cTo make it even. Yes?\u201d</p><p>I give him a slight nod. \u201cWhy not.\u201d</p><p>The orchestra plays some old tune I don\u2019t recognize, and my dance partner lowers his head to my ear. Soft, firm lips brush the shell.</p> <p>\u201cSince we don\u2019t know one another,\u201d he whispers, \u201clet\u2019s go for a walk and get some air.\u201d His lips brush the skin right below my ear. \u201cBecome acquainted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d I respond. \u201cLet\u2019s go become...acquainted, then.\u201d</p><p>Wordlessly, he slips his hand to my lower back and leads me through the throng of partiers, to a set of French double doors near the back of the hall. Flanked by giant urns of green leafy ferns and marble statues, I can\u2019t for the life of me figure out where I am. Cotillions and soirees aren\u2019t exactly my thing. At least, I don\u2019t think they are. I make eye contact with very few, but it\u2019s because no one wants to look at my eyes. Instead they are fascinated by my dragons. I do notice that although the setting and music are both old-fashioned, most of the dancers are younger. Mid-twenties, maybe?</p><p>In the next breath we\u2019re outside. It\u2019s almost as though I somehow changed scenes in a movie. Literally. One second I\u2019m standing inside. The next second, I\u2019m beneath a canopy of moss and oaks, on a stone path through the garden. I glance up and around. The night is dark, starry, and moonless. A marble fountain spurts delicate sprays of water, pink from the lamp beneath the surface. A couple sits on a stone bench close by, their words whispered, muffled. My unknown date leads me past them, and as I glance down I see the woman\u2019s hand grope the man\u2019s crotch. His barely restrained moan reaches my ears. I notice he\u2019s looking dead at me. I also notice his eyes have a sort of...glow.</p><p>Soon, we leave the horny couple behind and I find myself completely alone with a total stranger. The slight strains from the orchestra carry along the breeze until it seems we\u2019re miles away from the ball. Shadows fall longer, the wood around the path grows denser.</p><p>\u201cAre you afraid?\u201d he asks. We stop. He rounds on me, facing me.</p><p>\u201cOf what?\u201d I return.</p><p>His hands ease to my hips, skim my bare back, and pull me close. I feel weird, as if I can\u2019t really help my reaction to him. Even when his head lowers, I\u2019m unable to pull away.</p><p>\u201cOf loving me more than you love him,\u201d he answers, his lips brushing close to mine, yet not touching them. \u201cI think you are.\u201d</p><p>Of him? Who? I can\u2019t seem to help myself. I turn my mouth to his, and immediately he groans and covers my lips with his. The kiss is slow, erotic, and he takes his time to explore my mouth thoroughly, as if this is the only chance he\u2019ll have. It feels like he\u2019s waited for this moment a long, long time. I find myself kissing him back, and my hands thread around his neck and hold him tightly. Again he groans, and his kiss heightens. His hands slide down my bare back, over my ass, until he finds the slit in the dress and grazes the exposed skin of my thigh.</p><p>Then, he stills. For a moment, we\u2019re both suspended there, in the dense wood, on a stone path. His hand leaves my thigh and cups my face. With a gentleness that surprises me, he strokes my lips with his thumb, then brushes a kiss there.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve no idea how long I\u2019ve waited for this,\u201d he says, his accent thicker. He kisses me again, then moves his mouth to my ear. He says something in a language I don\u2019t understand. \u201cForever,\u201d he whispers. \u201cAnd it\u2019s exactly how I imagined.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m looking at him, his face half cast in shadow, and I can\u2019t remember who he is. Familiar? Yes. Attractive? Totally. But there\u2019s something missing here. Something absolutely not right...</p><p>\u201cRiley, didn\u2019t you hear what I said?\u201d</p><p>I jerk, and again, my vision is blurry. Slowly, I focus. I\u2019m confused. I\u2019m pissed. And I don\u2019t like either.</p><p>Woman staring at me. Auburn hair pulled into high pigtails. Bright red lipstick. Who the hell is she? Her eyes are wide and frightened as she stares hard at me. Her lips are moving but I don\u2019t know what the hell she\u2019s saying. There is no sound coming out.</p><p>All I can hear is her heart beating. Fast. Maybe I feel it more than hear it.</p><p>I turn to leave, to escape, and I then feel a hand close around my arm. I react. I turn and jack the woman up against the wall, holding her there by her throat. Although I\u2019m staring dead at her face, I don\u2019t really see her. Her features are a fuzzy blur. Her body begins to jerk, and she\u2019s gasping for air, clawing at my hand with pale white fingers. Long legs clad in ridiculous-looking striped stockings kick the wall. I smile at her.</p><p>All at once I\u2019m tackled and I hit the floor. Frantic voices, swearing, shouting surround me, and I start to struggle. A weight, almost unbearable, pins me down. Not for long, though, because I find my strength.</p><p>\u201cGoddamn, Riley, hold still!\u201d the voice warns, and straddles me in a way that I can\u2019t move my arms or legs. I don\u2019t recognize the voice, but it\u2019s deep, accented, and threatening. All I want to do is escape. Get away. But I can barely breathe, much less run away. Whoever is on top of me is one strong fuck.</p><p>\u201cNyx, call Mrs. Dupr\u00e9,\u201d the same voice yells. \u201cNow! And get Ms. Estelle over here, too.\u201d</p><p>I thrash some more. \u201cGet the fuck off me!\u201d I growl. I buck, begin to pull one of my knees up under me. The body atop me grunts, mutters something in a foreign language, and holds me tighter.</p><p>\u201cHold her, Zetty,\u201d a female voice warns. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to get a better grip on her legs or she\u2019ll kick right out from under you. I\u2019ve seen her do it.\u201d</p><p>More weight, distributed over my legs and arms, and no matter how hard I pitch, I\u2019m stuck. My face is pushed into the floor. I don\u2019t know who Zetty is, or Nyx, but they\u2019re both dead when I get free.</p><p>\u201cCall, Nyx,\u201d the Zetty person says. \u201cI can\u2019t hold her forever.\u201d</p><p>I hear the Nyx person speaking in an excited voice to someone, then she moves into my line of sight. Same stupid stockings. Must be the heartbeat I had by the throat. She comes closer, bends down, and looks at me. I\u2019m so filled with rage I want to gnash out with my teeth and grab her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cRiley, it\u2019s going to be okay,\u201d she says. Her eyes are wide and fearful, but there\u2019s pity in her voice. \u201cI promise, it will be. And I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>I do nothing but stare at her and growl.</p><p>Her hand goes to her throat and she quickly backs away.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, stay back, Nyx,\u201d the male says. \u201cShe\u2019s strong.\u201d</p><p>In the next instant, a small dark woman is suddenly there. She bends over at the waist and looks at me, the crinkles at the corners of her eyes deeply engrained into her skin. I try to lunge, but I\u2019m trapped beneath the human. Her ebony face frowns at me, unafraid.</p><p>\u201cGirl, we gonna git you right,\u201d she says, shakes a bony finger at me, then looks at the male. \u201cYou stay put on her dere, boy. She git loose an\u2019 we\u2019ll be in trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d the male says. He holds me tighter still.</p><p>I gather all of my strength, buck hard and scream.</p> <p>The male, Zetty, has a tight enough hold that I barely move an inch.</p><p>The dark woman smiles and nods. \u201cGood. I\u2019ll be back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRiley!\u201d another male yells. \u201cZetty, what\u2019s happening?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Seth,\u201d another says, this time a small, petite woman. No, not a woman. She\u2019s pulseless. There are two without pulses in this room. With my vision cloudy, I seek them out. Short, compact, eyes aglow.</p><p>\u201cGet away from me,\u201d I growl, squinting to make my vision clear. The younger male, human, edges closer.</p><p>\u201cRiley, no,\u201d he says quietly. His face is pinched in pain, and I can\u2019t understand why.</p> <p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t recognize you, Seth,\u201d the young pulseless female says. \u201cYou\u2019d better step back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he says, unbending. \u201cShe\u2019s my sister.\u201d This he says so soft only I can hear.</p><p>Not that I understand it.</p><p>The dark woman returns, and everything spins out of control at that point. I\u2019m lost, suffocating, drowning, fighting. I feel like I\u2019m dying, like I\u2019m more thirsty than I\u2019ve ever been in my entire life. No, not thirsty. It\u2019s hunger. Hunger and thirst combined. I need...something. A light-headed feeling comes over me, and now I\u2019m dizzy. Something is forced down my throat, and although I thrash back and forth, I\u2019m overpowered. Someone with very small but strong hands holds my head, and something disgusting is jammed past my lips. I cough, spit, but those same steely hands now grip my jaw closed. I have to swallow. I hear yells, cries, and what I can only assume is my own voice moaning in agony. My body goes limp. Feet shuffle around me. I hear the sounds, and the whispers, but nothing more. I can\u2019t understand any words. I can\u2019t see faces. I see only darkness, hear only whispers. They\u2019re frightening me now, the whispers, and I try to hide but my body won\u2019t move. They\u2019re after me. They want to kill me.</p><p>They want to eat me.</p><p>Soon, though, the voices, whispers, shuffling feet, all become muffled. Then, they disappear.</p><p>I am now in total silent darkness.</p><p>Part Five</p> <p>CARPATHIANS</p><p>I\u2019ve never seen Riley like this. I was so little when she was messed up before, I remember almost nothing. I do remember my mom crying a lot, and Riley stumbling in at four in the morning, high as a kite. What I recall most is how she changed her life. Now? To see her like this again? It makes my stomach hurt to watch her. She\u2019s like a wild animal, and she recognizes none of us. And to know it\u2019s nothing as simple as crack or cocaine scares the hell out of me. She\u2019s turning. My big sister, who\u2019s always taken care of me, is in the throes of a dual-venomed quickening. I might not be so worried if Preacher and Mr. Dupr\u00e9 weren\u2019t so worried. But they are. So, I am. I can only pray what we\u2019re doing to her works. It\u2019s tortuous to watch\u2014way worse than Da Isle and Gullah cleansing. I feel helpless. I...love my sister more than anything. I want her back. And I\u2019ll do anything to get that.</p><p>\u2014Seth Poe</p><p>The voices. They\u2019re back. So I\u2019m not dead after all. Or, maybe I am and this is what Hell is like at first. A load of weird scary shit to make you really think hard about what you did to land yourself a place here. That\u2019s the thing. I don\u2019t know.</p><p>I try to move; my arms and legs are tethered. I try to crack open my eyes, but still I see nothing but darkness. Yet...I feel movement. Hear whispers. Air brushes my cheek and I feel a presence close.</p><p>\u201cRiley,\u201d a deep, slightly accented voice says in my ear. \u201cCan you hear me?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m who they think I am, but I try to respond. My mouth is frozen, lips won\u2019t move. I try to scream. Nothing comes out.</p><p>\u201cShhh, ch\u00e8re,\u201d the voice says, and I feel a lukewarm hand brush my forehead. \u201cBe still. It won\u2019t be long. I\u2019m right here and I\u2019m not leaving.\u201d</p><p>The surrounding noises infiltrate my brain, and I detect a low, constant humming. Almost a whistle at times. I stop fighting, stop trying to see, and just fall back into the shadows.</p><p>I awaken to a jerking motion. This time, even for only a few seconds, I can see. I\u2019m riding in something. A car? A train? Feels more like a train, and I can hear that constant clack-clack of the tracks. Where the hell am I? I stretch my eyes open farther, and I can barely see out of the window next to me. It\u2019s light outside. Foggy. And just as I look, we disappear into a tunnel bored straight into the mountain. Then, it\u2019s dark again, exhaustion overwhelms me, and I drift back to sleep with the clack-clack of the train as a lullaby.</p><p>When next I awaken, I know nothing except pain. Pain and starvation. Why won\u2019t someone feed me? I want to cry, and no tears will come. Fury overcomes me, and I gather what little energy I have to thrash against bonds still holding me prisoner. I don\u2019t know how long I fight, but it feels like a long damn time. Hands hold me down. Then, a scent washes over me. Exotic. Sensual. Seductive. I feel the fight leave me in hopes of replacing it with whatever accompanies the intoxicating scent. Eventually, though, I tire. I give up. The scent disappears as fast as it came upon me.</p><p>More whispers. One voice in particular whispers close to my ear in a language I don\u2019t understand. This one, whoever he is, is pulseless. And he never leaves my side. Always there, always touching. Then, as suddenly as I had awakened, I fall back into a deep, deep sleep.</p><p>\u201cJake, hold her steady,\u201d the accented voice commands.</p><p>\u201cDamn me, but I am,\u201d someone responds. \u201cShe\u2019s like a rabid fecking dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEli, move over,\u201d another male voice says. \u201cI got this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell no, Miles,\u201d the accented voice says. \u201cYou keep that shit to yourself.\u201d</p><p>Male laughter. \u201cIt\u2019s either me or Victorian. Which do you prefer, Eli?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither,\u201d he responds.</p><p>More male laughter.</p><p>\u201cYou boys mustn\u2019t horse around so,\u201d an elderly voice, also accented, commands. \u201cThat\u2019s the only bit of Preacher\u2019s herbs we have left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, she needed more than I thought she would, Papa,\u201d another replies.</p><p>\u201cMy father has called,\u201d yet another voice offers. \u201cHe wishes us to gather in the library.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have a padded room or something?\u201d another adds. \u201cShe\u2019s going to go buck-fuck wild when we turn her loose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see about that,\u201d another says. \u201cShe can\u2019t be all that strong.\u201d</p><p>More male laughter.</p><p>Energy courses through me now, and I\u2019m angry. Pissed. Three males, all pulseless, surround me in some room I don\u2019t recognize. I\u2019ve got to get out. Get away.</p><p>I lunge at the one closest to me and wrap my legs around his neck. We fall to the floor.</p><p>\u201cGoddamn!\u201d he mutters, and I twist around his body. In a half second I have him pinned, and just as I\u2019m ready to strike, I\u2019m knocked backward. I land on my feet, dazed for only a second. I lower, crouch, and eye my next target. He\u2019s closest to the window.</p><p>I\u2019ll go out of it if I have to.</p><p>\u201cEli, she\u2019s going for the window,\u201d one wisely notices.</p><p>I\u2019m already moving. I fake left, bound off first a wooden bench, then the wall, use one male\u2019s chest as leverage and I push off, landing square on the sill in a crouch. I turn, glaring at my captors, daring them to come near me. The one I just pushed off of is just now picking himself up off the floor. I\u2019m barely out of breath. One is moving toward me slowly.</p><p>\u201cNoah,\u201d one says. \u201cWatch your back. She\u2019s ready to pounce.\u201d</p><p>I seek him out. He grins. \u201cI\u2019m ready for it,\u201d he says. Cocky bastard.</p><p>Oh, hell no, he isn\u2019t. In one jerky motion I\u2019m at him, legs wrapped around his waist, his neck in a choke hold.</p><p>\u201cFuck!\u201d he yells, and tries to shake me off. I hold tighter. His arm reaches up to grab me, and I land two punches on his jaw. One more in his eye. All under three seconds. So fast he doesn\u2019t have time to react until I\u2019m already finished. I pull my strength and use his body to push off of. I\u2019m back on the window sill, glaring. Daring.</p><p>\u201cLook at her eyes,\u201d another says. \u201cAlmost white.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBad juju right there,\u201d the grinning one says. \u201cI mean bad. She\u2019s strong as shit.\u201d He\u2019s rubbing his jaw, smiling at me.</p><p>\u201cShe needs to be fed,\u201d one replies, and his gaze hasn\u2019t left mine the whole time. \u201cArcos? You taking care of that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlready done,\u201d he answers. \u201cHurry.\u201d</p><p>I wait no longer. In the next breath I leap upward with all my strength, grasping one long rafter with my fingertips. It\u2019s enough. I pull myself up, then crouch and ease to the far corner of the room, high above all the others.</p><p>\u201cOh, shit,\u201d one says. \u201cI told you this was a bad idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow the hell are we going to get her down?\u201d another asks.</p><p>\u201cWe wait,\u201d the one who constantly stares says. \u201cShe\u2019ll tire. She\u2019ll get hungry. She\u2019ll come down.\u201d</p><p>I peer at all of them from my corner rafter, high above the floor. I\u2019m in the dark, swamped by shadows, but they all can see me perfectly clear. I grasp my beam and hold tight. I sit. I stare. I wait. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHere. Sit up and drink this. You\u2019ll feel better.\u201d</p><p>My eyes crack open, and light pours in. Someone must have pulled me off the rafters. My body aches, and I feel beaten. I squint, blink rapidly, and allow the pulseless male to cradle my head. Something firm nudges my lips, the scent of nutrients stings my nostrils and I open my mouth like a baby bird awaiting a worm. Warm liquid drizzles down my throat. In seconds, I do feel better. No energy, but at least that roaring, fiery pain has disappeared. I drink for a while. Minutes. Finally finished, I drift. Again, I sleep.</p><p>\u201cWake her, Noah,\u201d an elderly accented voice commands.</p> <p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he drawls. \u201cSomeone hold this for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate this,\u201d a now familiar voice mutters.</p><p>I am awake. I\u2019m just so drowsy I keep my eyes closed. I hear the voices around me. Suddenly, though, I get a whiff of...something. Then, it disappears. Then...an erotic feeling crashes over me and my eyes pop wide open. I stare into the painfully beautiful face of the same man whose ass I whipped the last time. Now, though, I don\u2019t want to fight. I grasp him around the neck, pull his mouth to mine, and kiss him. Hard. He kisses me back, but I barely notice because my fingers are searching for an edge of cloth\u2014his clothes\u2014to yank off. I can\u2019t get enough of him. I find skin. Stomach. Rigid muscles. I grope. He moans. I moan\u2014</p><p>\u201cNoah!\u201d the familiar voice warns. I barely hear him, so engaged in disrobing whoever was driving me sexually insane. Just the feel of his tongue against mine nearly makes me orgasm.</p><p>\u201cBind her now,\u201d an elderly voice says. \u201cBring her to me.\u201d</p> <p>With my mouth still latched on to my new obsession, my hands are pulled behind me and tethered. My feet are bound. I don\u2019t care. Only when the male I\u2019m sucking on is pulled from me do I become alert. I blink several times, shake my head, and look around. I am put in a straight-backed chair. I watch closely.</p><p>I\u2019m in a room. A strange, large, empty room. Windowless. And in it are six males. All pulseless. There\u2019s only one heartbeat within, and it\u2019s mine. So sluggish, it barely thumps five times per minute.</p><p>Two elderly males stand close, facing one another.</p><p>\u201cGilles Dupr\u00e9,\u201d one says. \u201cWe\u2019ve but one choice to right this matter.\u201d</p><p>The one called Gilles nods. \u201cOui, Julian. You are unfortunately correct.\u201d He glances at me. \u201cThere is no other way?\u201d</p><p>The one called Julian shakes his head. He has long, straight silver hair pulled into a silver clip. \u201cNo. A force stronger than Valerian\u2019s must enter her, and the only force stronger than his venom is mine.\u201d His gaze passes over me, then over the others before returning to the one called Gilles. \u201cIn return for my aid, I require the return of my eldest son, Valerian.\u201d He looks at one of the males in particular. \u201cUnharmed and intact.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe needs to be punished for his actions,\u201d that one called Eli demands vehemently. \u201cHe cannot simply go free.\u201d</p><p>Julian nods. \u201cOf course. And we shall see justice served. Through our counsel, punishment will occur.\u201d He again looks at Gilles. \u201cAgreed?\u201d</p><p>Gilles glances at the others, then back to Julian. \u201cNo harm will come to this girl?\u201d</p><p>Julian gives a slight nod. \u201cI vow it.\u201d</p><p>Gilles nods. \u201cVery well, then.\u201d</p><p>Julian meets the gaze of one of the males\u2014dark, tall, young. \u201cVictorian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Father,\u201d he answers.</p><p>In my next breath I am leapt upon by the male Julian. His face is clear before me, contorted, gruesome, his eyes white, the pupils red and pinpoint. Long, jagged fangs drop from his top jaw, and immediately he sinks them into my throat. Cradling my head so I can\u2019t move, he sucks. Fire shoots through my arteries, travels my body and jumps track, then courses through my veins. I thrash against him, but it\u2019s useless. Inside, I\u2019m on fire. Literally.</p> <p>\u201cNon!\u201d the familiar accented voice belonging to the one called Eli shouts, and his voice is angered now, almost a growl. I see nothing. I hear commotion.</p><p>\u201cHold him,\u201d the one called Gilles orders. \u201cHold him tightly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet her go!\u201d Eli shouts. \u201cI will kill you right here!\u201d</p><p>Pain tears through me as needle-sharp fangs remain buried deep into my throat, suckling my life force. I\u2019m hot, on fire, and my body begins to seize.</p><p>Then it\u2019s over. The fangs are withdrawn. My head is now free and falls forward as the one called Julian releases me. I am weakened now, and haven\u2019t the strength to raise my head. I gasp for air as intense agony courses through me. Tears spill over my lids and run down my cheeks. I watch them splatter onto the wood floor beneath me.</p><p>\u201cAndorra, Miles,\u201d a growl says menacingly, evenly. It\u2019s the one called Eli again. \u201cLet me go. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJake, Noah, free him,\u201d another says.</p><p>Then, in less than a second, he\u2019s here, beside me. The familiar one. Holding my head up and cradling it in a much different way from the other one. I feel his body shaking as he holds me to him. I want to thrash out, fight him, but I can\u2019t. Part of me doesn\u2019t want to anyway, and I don\u2019t understand why. I\u2019m motionless, with no energy. Helpless. That, I hate. Loathe.</p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d he whispers. Then, with his mouth to my ear, \u201cSoyez toujours. Ce sera pas mal, l\u2019amour.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve no idea what he\u2019s said to me, but it\u2019s soothing, and somehow it calms me.</p><p>Even if only for a moment.</p><p>The commotion that follows is too much for my comprehension. The familiar one moves, lightning-fast, and lunges toward the one that bit me. Before he reaches him, though, three others jump him. He struggles. Swears violently. Thrashes.</p><p>Then, he changes.</p><p>I\u2019m beginning to blank out, my vision is blurry, but yet I can see him. He\u2019s as frightening as the old one, with long jagged fangs and a distorted face.</p><p>\u201cWhy, Arcos?\u201d he yells at the old one. \u201cWhy!\u201d He continues to push against the three holding him secure.</p><p>The old one shrugs. \u201c\u2019Twas faster,\u201d he says. \u201cAll is well and done. The only way she\u2019ll ever be able to maintain control of her indistinct DNA and to ward off my elder son\u2019s venom is to add mine. It is done. But,\u201d he continues, \u201cyou must all remain here, at Castle Arcos, until the time of the quickening passes for her. She will be in a most weakened and vulnerable state, followed by\u201d\u2014he chuckles\u2014\u201clet us just say she will be very difficult to handle while her DNA is changing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can handle her,\u201d the familiar one named Eli says with ferocity.</p><p>Again, the old one laughs. \u201cOh, my fierce Dupr\u00e9,\u201d he says. \u201cI think not. Whilst she will not become vampiric, she will in fact have the venom of three powerful strigoi brethren circulating within her body. She\u2019ll be as close to being a vampire as a human can be. Yet, in the end, it will be her only rescue. She\u2019ll need it to ward off the cravings placed there by Valerian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are other ways!\u201d the familiar one shouts. He tries to lunge once more but is restrained. He is so enraged, his voice doesn\u2019t sound like his own.</p><p>\u201cMon fils,\u201d the other elder says, his voice stern, calm. He lays a hand on his son\u2019s forearm. \u201cLet us leave for now. Julian,\u201d he addresses the old one, \u201cmerci beaucoup.\u201d</p><p>The old one gives a slight nod, accompanied by a chilling smile. He looks dead at me, wipes a drop of my blood from his lip, and licks it off. \u201cMy pleasure, Monsieur Dupr\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>Then, another is beside me. This one familiar also, yet still, unknown. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Riley,\u201d he whispers. \u201cTruly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet away from her,\u201d the other, Eli, demands. The warning is clear, even to me as I begin to drift.</p><p>All at once, my body shudders, the angered familiar one is there, suddenly, holding me close, and I succumb to blessed darkness once more.</p><p>\u201cRiley, Riley, shh...\u201d a voice soothes, consoles. Is it that one called Eli? It sounds like him. Why is he so concerned about me? \u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d he says.</p><p>A cold, wet cloth mops my forehead, my cheeks, my throat. A fiery fever ravages my body from the inside out, and I can\u2019t stop the violent tremors. My skin is so hot, it burns like the worst case of sun poisoning. Baked, white skin on a cloudless, treeless, windless August dog day of summer in the South. Water. I want water.</p><p>No. I want something else.</p><p>\u201cHere, here, ch\u00e8re,\u201d he croons, and places something to my lips. At first, just a drizzle slips down my throat. But the moment my taste buds register to my brain what it is, I guzzle. Gorge. With my arms, I\u2019m reaching, clutching out to him and holding on while he feeds me. It\u2019s warm, thick, and it soothes my burn like some internal balm. I don\u2019t know what it is, but my body likes it, demands more of it.</p><p>But after a few minutes, he takes it away. I scramble and grab, but he\u2019s fast. I know his name is Eli, and his voice continues to feel familiar to me, but I don\u2019t know who he is. Yet I\u2019m getting used to him. He may be the one keeping me restrained, but he\u2019s also the one who gives me what I need.</p><p>\u201cMore later. For now, rest,\u201d he says.</p><p>I rest. Until, the pain awakes me. Fire. Scalding lava instead of blood coursing my veins and arteries. It feels like my skin is peeling off, and I writhe in agony. My voice, screaming in anguish, sounds disembodied. I scratch, claw at what skin I can reach. My hands, my arms are bound, and I feel like my muscles are coming apart.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you do anything for her?\u201d he yells. I feel his hands, a cold, wet cloth, on my body. \u201cPapa? Please!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNon,\u201d an elder voice says calmly. \u201cIt must run its course, as you know. She is strong and will survive.\u201d</p><p>A wave of convulsions shakes me until blackness engulfs my mind.</p><p>I awaken, huddled in a darkened corner. I\u2019ve no idea where I am, how much time has passed since that pulseless elder sank his fangs into my throat. I only know that this place surrounding me is cold, damp, and pitch black. There\u2019s a musty odor hanging in the air. I sense...beings close by. They\u2019re calling out Riley! Riley! That\u2019s not me. Riley is a human name. I\u2019m...something different. I\u2019ve got to escape. Get away. Run. Waiting for silence, it arrives. I slip from my hiding place, check the corridor to find it empty, and ease out. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It\u2019s a long hall. Wall sconces adorn the stone walls, and amber light falls over a narrow strip of carpeted walkway. I follow it to the end, where a winding iron staircase leads upward. I can mount the steps and take the twirling stairs two at a time. If I can make it outside, I\u2019m gone. Almost there...</p><p>No sooner do my feet hit the first step than a body crashes into me, then pulls me back. We land on the corridor floor. Finding my footing, I\u2019m up, turning, backing away, and my vision falls on another. Pulseless. Beautiful. And a wicked gleam lights up a mercury pair of eyes. His mouth tips up at the corner. Challenging.</p><p>Steeling myself, I lunge, slide, sweeping his legs out from under him. He falls onto his back. Just as fast, he\u2019s up and springing at me. I leap and fall onto his back, my legs locked around his waist, my arm forcing his head into a choke hold. He backs and plows me against the stone wall. Back, back, he slams me, over and over, but I hold tightly. I\u2019m trying to rip his head off. The goddamned thing won\u2019t budge.</p> <p>\u201cRiley, it\u2019s Noah. Get off me!\u201d he yells.</p><p>Voices fill the corridor and I turn and glimpse three others running toward us. I turn Noah loose and land in a run, heading for the spiral steps. I\u2019m up them in five seconds and onto the roof.</p><p>\u201cShe nearly took my fucking head,\u201d I hear one say.</p><p>\u201cGoddamn, Noah,\u201d another exclaims. \u201cGoddamn.\u201d</p><p>Outside, I\u2019m free. There is a multitude of reddish steeples and turret roofs. This place...it\u2019s on a rocky hilltop, surrounded by thick forest. A soupy mist hangs over the estate, slips through the trees. That\u2019s where I have to go. The woods. There, I can escape. Disappear into the fog. I run along a narrow path with a short wall that barely comes to my waist. They\u2019re behind me. All of them.</p> <p>Reaching the far corner, I don\u2019t hesitate. I clear the edge, slipping over and down the sun-bleached white stone and mortar. Digging my fingers into the surface, I find pigeonholes that keep me from falling. The last thirty feet or so, I drop, land in a crouch, scan my surroundings, then take off. Already, the mist envelops me. They\u2019ll not find me\u2014</p><p>My body hurls through the air and lands with another atop me.</p><p>\u201cRiley, \u2019tis Victorian,\u201d he says. \u201cStop fighting!\u201d He holds me still, tries to pull my arms behind my back but I buck him off. I blindly leap and hit a rough, wooden base. A tree. I don\u2019t even look; I begin to climb.</p><p>\u201cRiley, come down from there!\u201d he calls after me.</p><p>I ignore. I don\u2019t look down until I\u2019m far up. Clinging to a thick branch, I glance to the ground. Tall, beautiful, with long brown hair pulled back, the pulseless one stares up at me. Then, he shakes his head, mutters something unintelligible, and throws himself at the tree. He\u2019s climbing. Toward me. Fast.</p><p>I leap several trees before dropping to the ground at a dead-run. The mist is thicker now, and I can barely see my hand in front of me. The voices behind me are growing faint; I\u2019m getting away. Free at last. I run faster, weaving through the dense wood. It\u2019s a blind run now as the fog is so soupy, I can only see the almost-black trunks of trees as I move. My insides are buzzing; adrenaline fires through my bloodstream and I\u2019m almost hyper. The noises and sounds of the wood increase in pitch and all at once. It\u2019s so discombobulated, it makes me dizzy. I try to tune it out, but it doesn\u2019t work. Only gets louder\u2014</p> <p>A body slams into me and we both go down. He\u2019s strong, this pulseless one, and he holds his hand over my mouth. His entire body covers mine, holding me with his legs like a vise. \u201cBe still if you want your freedom,\u201d he warns. \u201cAnd do as I say.\u201d</p><p>I go dead-still. I don\u2019t trust him. I buck\u2014hard. His body shifts and it\u2019s just enough for me to writhe out from beneath him. He\u2019s strong, but so am I.</p><p>Just as I escape, my ankle is grabbed and down I go. I scramble, arms and fingers clawing and digging into the bracken of the forest floor. I see nothing but white as the mist slips between us, and frantically I try to pry the hand grasping my ankle loose. I kick with my other foot. I\u2019m released for about a half second, and again I scramble. Grabbed again and dragged across the damp leaves and dirt. My arms are yanked behind me and bound. As I\u2019m forced to stand, I growl. My skin feels flushed with fire as I\u2019m jerked around to face my captor.</p><p>It\u2019s him. The familiar one. The glare I give him almost hurts my face, it\u2019s so severe.</p><p>\u201cYou can give me da plat-eye later, Poe,\u201d he grumbles, then ducks, dumps me over his shoulder, and puts one arm across the back of my calves. The other is firmly holding my ass. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s the voice of the one called Eli, but what\u2019s da plat-eye? He\u2019d said it in a strange accent, not his own. What the hell is going on?</p><p>He runs with me. I struggle, but it\u2019s no use. Deeper into the misty wood we go, until the trees and fog blur together. Suddenly, I feel queasy, and it\u2019s then he stops running. We\u2019re at a building of sorts, and we enter through a door. Inside it\u2019s dark and old smelling. The door slams shut and is locked.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be safe here,\u201d he says, and sets me down. The moment my feet hit the floor, the pain starts. I crumple. Fire shoots through me, and my body seizes.</p> <p>\u201cRiley, shhh,\u201d he says in a low voice. \u201cIt will soon pass.\u201d</p><p>Nothing\u2019s passing. Pain rips through me, setting my insides writhing in agony. The scream I hear is mine, but I barely recognize it. Soon, blackness washes over me.</p><p>Even though my body is relaxed now, I\u2019m not in control. I\u2019m drained again, listless. I\u2019ve no energy, not even to weep. I can barely open my eyes, even a fraction, but I force myself to. He\u2019s beside me. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s never left. The room is hazy, cavernous, and cool. A soft, yellowish light falls over a hearth, a wardrobe, a single chair, a chest of sorts.</p><p>\u201cRiley,\u201d he says softly.</p><p>He calls me that frequently. I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s just what he\u2019s named me, or if it really is my name. I can\u2019t remember. All I know is I can\u2019t even move my head to look at him.</p><p>His hands move over my body\u2014my wrists, my ankles\u2014and his fingers move over the skin where tethers once bound me. I want to lunge, escape, but I can\u2019t move. I\u2019m barely breathing. Somehow, in my distorted thoughts, I find that better than the pain. Perhaps I\u2019m slowly dying? Might be best.</p><p>He grows near, gathers my body to his. I feel his embrace encircle me, and for the first time I notice his scent. Intoxicating. It hurts to breathe in deeply, so I allow my shallow breath to take it in. I close my eyes.</p><p>In the next instant, his mouth is at my ear.</p><p>\u201cJe suis d\u00e9sol\u00e9, mon amour.\u201d I don\u2019t understand the words, but his tone is...regretful. Saddened, perhaps. His breath fans over my throat, his lips caressing my skin. \u201cMais il n\u2019y a nulle autre voie. Il fera seulement mal un moment...\u201d</p><p>The sound of his voice, the tone of his unusual accent, comforts me. I relax, draw in a breath\u2014then it catches in my throat as something razor sharp pierces my throat. My artery is punctured. I know this because I feel it pop. His mouth is against me there.</p><p>I\u2019m paralyzed at first; my body stretches, arcs, then goes completely rigid. The pain is so intense, nausea again sweeps me, and then the uncontrollable shaking begins. I feel tethered once more, unable to move. My breathing is fast, shallow. Soon, I pass out.</p><p>\u201cRiley?\u201d</p><p>The feel of knuckles caressing my cheek, along with the voice, awakens me. My eyes flutter open, and I turn toward the one sitting beside me. At first, my vision is blurry. Blinking furiously, it clears. I see him.</p><p>\u201cEli?\u201d I say. My voice is cracked, deep, and gravelly. \u201cWhat happened? I feel like I\u2019ve been hit by a truck.\u201d</p><p>With one hand, Eli smoothes the hair back from my face and caresses my cheek with his knuckles. Cerulean blue eyes fasten on to mine, and he smiles. \u201cMa ch\u00e8re,\u201d he says softly. Somehow, it sounds different than usual. It has more...feeling.</p><p>With effort, I turn my head and glance around the room. The walls are stone. I\u2019m in a large bed; a hearth sits on the far wall across from me. There is one window. Dark beamed rafters are overhead. \u201cWhere are we?\u201d I say, then reaching up, I touch my neck. It feels stiff, as though I\u2019d been craning, or straining. No, it hurts deeper than muscle. \u201cDamn, my throat hurts.\u201d</p><p>Eli reaches, grasps my hand, and laces our fingers together. He leans closer. \u201cRiley,\u201d he says, his expression grave. \u201cWhat\u2019s the last thing you remember?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t like his intensity. Not now. Something\u2019s up. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head. \u201cDon\u2019t try to analyze anything right now. Not this time, Riley. Just tell me,\u201d he says again, and squeezes my hand. His lukewarm skin comforts me. \u201cThe very last thing you remember.\u201d</p><p>Despite my irritation at Eli\u2019s odd demand, I search my brain, and I think really, really hard. What in hell is the last thing I remember? I stare at some random point on the wall across the room. \u201cI remember feeling...angry,\u201d I say. \u201cI don\u2019t know why, but I was. Angry at everyone.\u201d I turn my head to him. \u201cIncluding you.\u201d</p><p>He stares at me. \u201cWhat else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy does it matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else, Riley?\u201d he insists.</p><p>I take a deep breath and think some more. Then I remember. I push myself up by my elbows, fear gripping me. \u201cOh my God. Bhing, from next door.\u201d I look at Eli. \u201cShe was attacked by a vampire, I\u2019m pretty sure. I...fought it. She ran off.\u201d</p><p>Eli\u2019s eyes watch me closely. He doesn\u2019t blink. He doesn\u2019t move. \u201cRiley,\u201d he says slowly. \u201cThat happened weeks ago.\u201d</p><p>Ice grips my insides. I look at him like he\u2019s lost his mind. \u201cThat\u2019s impossible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know it\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>My mind rushes in furious circles as I try my best to recall something. I squeeze my eyes tightly shut. Nothing comes. Only that of Bhing in the alley.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been experiencing a quickening. You\u2019ve been\u201d\u2014his gaze doesn\u2019t waver\u2014\u201cchanging.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Even opening my eyes and looking into Eli\u2019s doesn\u2019t soothe me. I don\u2019t even have to ask what into. I immediately know.</p><p>\u201cMy quickening. Was it worse than my cleansing at Da Island?\u201d I ask. That had been pretty intense. I remember most of it, and it included Preacher\u2019s root doctor herb and potions, being tied down, night sweats, and a lot of pain.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>I lie back down and stare at the ceiling. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d I ask out loud.</p><p>\u201cThe strigoi venom\u2014Valerian\u2019s in particular\u2014was taking over you,\u201d Eli explains. \u201cIt began...morphing. Changing. I didn\u2019t realize how severe.\u201d</p><p>I turn my gaze to him. \u201cHow severe?\u201d It now dawns on me, and my insides freeze. \u201cOh, Christ\u2014did I kill someone? How\u2019s Seth? Nyxinnia? Preacher and Estelle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re all fine, Riley.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t like the unanswered tone in his voice. \u201cWho isn\u2019t fine, Eli?\u201d</p> <p>He only stares at me.</p><p>\u201cEli!\u201d I yell. \u201cPlease!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re unsure,\u201d he answers, just as calm as I am anxious. \u201cA young Gullah girl was killed. But we\u2019ll worry about that later. We knew we couldn\u2019t risk any more time.\u201d</p><p>As his words settle uncomfortably into my brain, my gaze scans the room. Where am I? Old. Stone. Not Inksomnia, not Preacher\u2019s, and not the House of Dupr\u00e9. I look at him. \u201cWhat did you do, Eli?\u201d</p><p>His hard stare fixes to mine. \u201cThe only thing I could do, Riley.\u201d He goes through the motion of taking a deep breath. \u201cWe brought you to Castle Arcos. We\u2019re in Kudszir, Romania, Riley, with Victorian\u2019s father, Julian. You\u2019ve been here almost three weeks. My father, myself, Noah, Jake Andorra, and Victorian have been here as well.\u201d</p><p>Jake Andorra? Why would he be here? I\u2019ve never even met the guy. I only stayed at his house in Charleston when we fought Valerian\u2019s vampire fight clubs a little while back. I lay my palm against my forehead. \u201cThis can\u2019t be happening.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s more.\u201d</p><p>With my hand still fused to my head, I look at him. A bad feeling pits my stomach. \u201cWhat? What else can there be? Where\u2019s my brother?\u201d</p><p>Eli edges closer. \u201cSeth is safe. He\u2019s at home with my mother and sister. Listen, Riley. Look at me.\u201d I do. \u201cIn order to balance the strigoi DNA in your system, Julian had to inject his venom. It was the only way to give you control over Valerian\u2019s urges.\u201d</p><p>I blink. \u201cHow did Julian...inject his venom?\u201d</p><p>Rising from the bed, Eli walks to the fireless hearth. He runs his hand over the back of his neck. \u201cThe same way I did.\u201d</p><p>The moment the words are out of his mouth, I freeze. My insides grow numb, and mindlessly, my hand reaches for my throat. No freaking wonder it\u2019s so sore. \u201cYou bit me, Eli?\u201d I ask. Shock beats through me. Confusion makes my head spin.</p><p>In the next breath, he stands beside me, and he lifts my chin, forcing me to look at him. His gaze, harsh and desperate at the same time, may have at one time scared me. \u201cIt was the only way,\u201d he says, his voice low, unsteady, as though he were about to totally lose it. \u201cI couldn\u2019t stand the thought of all those Arcoses binding with your DNA.\u201d He drops his hands from my face, squeezes his eyes shut, lowers his head, and gathers his control. When he lifts his head, and those blue eyes stare into mine, I can plainly see he has gained it again. \u201cI wanted you to have my DNA, Riley. Dupr\u00e9. Not just Arcos.\u201d His French accent thickens with his last words.</p><p>A mixture of emotions crowd me at once, and I slowly stand. Part of me\u2014a big part\u2014understands Eli\u2019s actions. He didn\u2019t want three powerful and deadly strigois\u2019 DNA binding with mine. I get it. But the other part of me is pissed off. I know I was incapacitated, unable to make rational decisions. I know that. But still. Somehow, I feel...violated. Like I am nothing more than a beat-up doll thrown into the midst of four vampires who all take turns at me. Each trying to claim me. Well, I\u2019m not anyone\u2019s bitch. I\u2019m not available to be claimed. \u201cWhat part of me left is actually me, Eli?\u201d I ask, and I look at him. \u201cAny of it?\u201d I thump my chest. \u201cIs there anything left of Riley Poe inside? Or am I just some fucked-up mutated human with vampire tendencies?\u201d Anxiety and irritation claw at me. I pace. The need to run takes over. Eli senses it.</p> <p>\u201cRiley,\u201d he says, stilling me with one hand against my shoulder. \u201cStop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I reply. I\u2019m angry. Hurt. Confused. \u201cI need to talk to Seth. To Nyx. I...gotta be alone for a while, Eli. Think things through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNon.\u201d</p><p>I meet his look with silence. \u201cDon\u2019t follow me. You know I will outrun you.\u201d</p><p>Eli\u2019s eyes are hard, face determined. His grip tightens around my forearm. \u201cDon\u2019t do this, Riley. You\u2019re not in Savannah.\u201d</p><p>I give Eli one last look that hopefully conveys the message that I need to be alone. After several seconds, his hand drops from me. I turn, search the floor for shoes that look like mine, find a pair of worn brown hikers and pull them onto my bare feet. I head for the door in a house unfamiliar to me, and run.</p><p>Far into the wood I go, beneath a misty canopy of tall aged trees and atop thick bracken. Twice I look over my shoulder. Eli hasn\u2019t followed. Finally, I slow to a trot, then, I walk.</p><p>For the first time, I notice what I\u2019m wearing: jeans, a tank covered by a long-sleeved button-up shirt. I\u2019m hardly ever cold anymore, but Romania seems a little different from home. I notice a biting cold wind whipping through the trees. It rustles an array of various colors above me. Some fall to the ground. Is it October? November? I don\u2019t even know anymore. So consumed am I with the new knowledge of just what I have become, I barely notice my unique surroundings. The cold. The leaves. I don\u2019t care.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re deep in the Carpathians, love,\u201d Victorian\u2019s voice pushes through my mind. \u201cMy home.\u201d</p><p>I quickly look around, my gaze darting through the brush, along the beaten path through the bracken. No sign of Vic. \u201cYeah, I can see that,\u201d I say. \u201cDid you help bring me here?\u201d</p><p>He sighs. \u201cYes. \u2018Twas for your own good, I\u2019m afraid. Like I said in Atlanta\u2014my father is the only one strong enough to overpower Valerian\u2019s forces growing inside of you. Had he not intervened, you would have surely turned. Already you were experiencing a fierce quickening, Riley Poe. You nearly ripped the jet apart. Dupr\u00e9 had a difficult time containing you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so,\u201d I answer, and continue to walk. Past a large boulder, with several scattered rocks beside it, I meander along a path well worn by others before me. \u201cWhere are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>Startled, I jerk my head behind me. Victorian Arcos steps from behind an aged fir tree. I don\u2019t know why, but for some reason, the sight of him comforts me. Yeah, it bothers me that I feel that way\u2014that I ran from Eli, but am comforted by the sight of Victorian. I can\u2019t explain, so I won\u2019t even try. Not even to myself. Not now.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I say, and move toward him.</p><p>He gives a slight nod. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see you...sane.\u201d He smiles.</p><p>I give a slight chuckle. \u201cNot so sure about that, Vic.\u201d I look at him. \u201cYou following me?\u201d</p><p>His smile lingers. \u201cOf course.\u201d He cocks his head and studies me. \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>Turning, I shrug and begin to wander down the path. Something, and I don\u2019t know what, warned me not to tell Victorian about the newly added Dupr\u00e9 ingredient to my DNA. \u201cHow would you feel?\u201d I respond.</p><p>With a long stare, he finally nods. \u201cSo right, so right. My father...he can be quite, well, abrupt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d I say, and continue on. \u201cI can hardly wait to meet him.\u201d</p><p>In the next natural blink of my eyes, Victorian closes the distance between us and rounds on me. His hand on my shoulder stills me. \u201cI would have never let him harm you,\u201d he says, determination tightening his words. \u201cNever.\u201d</p><p>As I look into his unusual chocolate eyes, I see it. \u201cI know that.\u201d</p><p>With a single nod, he turns me loose. We continue on in silence.</p><p>After a while, the dense wood thins, and a small, ancient-looking village lies ahead in the mist.</p><p>\u201cThe belfry at the citadel has the most stunning view of all Transylvania over the village and back up to Castle Arcos. Would you like to see?\u201d</p><p>Sliding Victorian a gaze, I smile. Then I laugh. \u201cAre you freaking kidding me?\u201d</p><p>Victorian stares, confusion making his eyes question.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in Transylvania. A family of vampires?\u201d I encourage.</p><p>Victorian grins.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re my tour guide now?\u201d I say.</p><p>If a vampire could blush, it\u2019d be Victorian Arcos who could pull it off. He smiles. \u201cOf course. And, of course.\u201d</p><p>Now that I take a closer look at everything around me\u2014the ancient medieval village, the cobbled streets, the colorful buildings, the old-as-dirt-church and the castle? It totally reminds me of a scene out of Van Helsing. Any minute I expect Drac\u2019s brides to come flying over the belfry to swoop down and nab some dinner from a hapless villager.</p><p>\u201cWe never feed from our own villagers,\u201d Victorian offers.</p><p>I snap my head toward him. \u201cI thought you couldn\u2019t hear my thoughts.\u201d</p><p>He blinks, stares at me, and smiles. \u201cWell, I just heard you clear as a bell. It must be your new metabolic changes that have given me the communication back. Sweet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweet?\u201d I ask at his use of modern slang. Then I chuckle. Vic makes me laugh.</p><p>Just then, the bell in the church tower tolls. It sounds positively spooky.</p><p>As we descend from the forest and onto the path leading into the village, I notice my surroundings. Breathtaking hardly describes them.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d Victorian offers. \u201cOur land is second to no other.\u201d With an elegant sweep of his arm, he describes the view. \u201cWe\u2019re surrounded on three sides by the Carpathians,\u201d he says in his unique accent, and as I look, I see it\u2019s true. Rigid pikes, most with snowcaps, form an almost complete circle in the distance. \u201cReminds me a little of the Rockies,\u201d I answer. When I notice Victorian looking at me, I explain. \u201cBig ink conference in Denver.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell, very much like your Rockies, there are large animals in the wood,\u201d he says. \u201cYou need to take caution, Riley, when taking off alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of animals?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cBear. Lynx\u201d\u2014he meets my gaze\u2014\u201cwolf.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWarning heeded,\u201d I respond. Suddenly, my brother crosses my mind. Then I look at him. \u201cI need a pay phone.\u201d</p><p>Victorian immediately withdraws a mobile phone from his pocket. As we walk toward the church, he punches in a few numbers, then hands me the cell and guides me to sit on a little stone bench facing the cobbled streets. \u201cJust dial your area code and number. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t even think. I grab the phone and dial Seth\u2019s cell. It rings three times before my brother answers.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d Seth says.</p><p>A whoosh of relief rushes through me at hearing his voice. \u201cHey, bro. It\u2019s Ri.\u201d</p> <p>After a moment of silence, he answers. \u201cRiley?\u201d</p><p>I smile. \u201cYeah. How ya doin\u2019, squirt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRiley!\u201d he says excitedly. \u201cI miss you! How\u2014what\u2019s going on? Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>I laugh at the excitement in my brother\u2019s voice. I feel like I\u2019m smiling on the inside. \u201cGod, I miss you, little brother. Yes, I\u2019m okay. A little weird, but okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWeirder than before?\u201d he jokes.</p><p>\u201cA lot more,\u201d I answer. \u201cHow\u2019s Nyx\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you mean, a lot more?\u201d he asks. Worry now laces his words.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing, Seth,\u201d I say, not wanting to stress out my fifteen-year-old worrywart brother. \u201cNothing I can\u2019t handle. Seriously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI miss you, Ri,\u201d he says, and for a second, sounds like my old baby brother. Before vampires. \u201cWhen ya comin\u2019 home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure, but soon,\u201d I say. \u201cNyx?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s fine,\u201d he answers. \u201cLuc pretty much stays at the shop with her during the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. What else is going on?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s...been busy,\u201d he answers. \u201cA lot of activity between here and Charleston. Valerian\u2019s gang has been on the move. We\u2019ve managed to intercept several kills. They\u2019re random and unorganized, almost as if some of the newlings have split from Valerian. Noah\u2019s guys have been here twice. We\u2019ve been there three times and headed back tonight.\u201d</p><p>If Noah\u2019s little clan of humans with tendencies have been helping Seth and the others, then Valerian must be out of control.</p> <p>\u201cHow\u2019s Preach and Estelle?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d he sighs, then continues. \u201cEver since the Gullah killing, things have been tense. I repapered the entire upstairs of Preacher and Estelle\u2019s apartment, and just started on the kitchen. Fresh coat of haint blue on the door and ceiling. And Estelle\u2019s been making some stuff that stinks like crazy.\u201d</p><p>Haint blue paint is a Gullah belief; they use it on doors and ceilings to keep the bad spirits out. Estelle is a superb brewer of root potions, but they stink like hell. And work like hell, too.</p><p>I close my eyes briefly. \u201cThe killing. Tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEli didn\u2019t tell you?\u201d</p><p>I sigh. \u201cI didn\u2019t give him a chance. I ran out as soon as I woke up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWoke up from what?\u201d he pushes.</p><p>I give up. My baby brother deserved to know. \u201cI had two quickenings to get through. They\u2019re all done now, so no worries. Got it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Another Arcos. And a Dupr\u00e9. I\u2019ll explain that one later, so don\u2019t ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid they hurt you, Ri?\u201d he says solemnly.</p><p>\u201cNo, Seth. I\u2019m fine. Honest.\u201d I see Victorian heading toward me with something in his hand. \u201cAbout the killing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been kept quiet, but I overheard Mrs. D. talking to Mr. D. on the phone about it. We didn\u2019t know her, but she was one of the nieces. Seventeen years old. Preacher knows it wasn\u2019t the Dupr\u00e9s. Feels sure it wasn\u2019t you either, Riley. The attacks haven\u2019t stopped though. Seems like someone turns up dead every day, no matter that we run the streets each night. It\u2019s almost like the ones we\u2019ve saved haven\u2019t mattered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve mattered, bro. Every single one matters. And Seth, you guys have to check on Bhing,\u201d I say. \u201cI think she was attacked. She could be in the quickening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll see about it.\u201d</p><p>Victorian hands me something wrapped in a thick brown paper. \u201cI\u2019ve gotta go, bro. I love you. Be home soon. And stay safe, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will, and I love you, Ri,\u201d he answers. \u201cBe careful. And don\u2019t fully put your trust in Victorian. I know he\u2019s there, and that he has helped you. But, I don\u2019t know. Something about him. I\u2019m not sure I like it.\u201d</p><p>I smile. \u201cOkay, okay. Got it. Watch your back. And I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove you, too.\u201d</p><p>The click on the line lets me know my little brother has ended the call. I give Vic back his cell.</p><p>\u201cIs all well there?\u201d he asks, then sits beside me.</p><p>I shrug and peek inside the paper. A fried dough pie of sorts, and it smells like pot roast inside. \u201cWell, my brother\u2019s okay.\u201d I lift the pie to my nose and sniff, then look at Vic. \u201cBut there\u2019s a lot of shit going on. Your brother is on a rampage and doesn\u2019t seem to have his army under control.\u201d My teeth sink into the meat pie, and the moment the spicy flavors hit my tongue, my stomach growls in answer. I had no idea how long it\u2019d been since I\u2019d eaten anything. Normal people food, that is.</p><p>Victorian\u2019s chocolate brown eyes stay locked on me. \u201cYes, it\u2019s a bad situation there. My brother\u201d\u2014he looks away\u2014\u201cis out of control.\u201d He stares off, toward the jagged mountains. \u201cDespite my father\u2019s crassness, he is still very much a believer in following the codes of vampires.\u201d He looks at me then, eyes hardened. \u201cIf caught, Valerian will suffer in ways you can\u2019t fathom.\u201d</p><p>I continue eating, almost to the point of cramming larger bites into my mouth to feed my starving stomach.</p><p>\u201cGood, yes?\u201d Vic asks. He nods in the direction he walked from. \u201cBest baker within a hundred miles.\u201d</p><p>I nod in agreement, thinking he has to be right, and continue devouring. As I chew, I glance out over the small village, and the people moving about the cobbled streets. An old woman\u2014red scarf tied over her hair, a brown dress and brightly colored apron tied over the front, and a woolen sweater, with sturdy, shin-high black boots\u2014hustles across the street with surprising agility. As she passes us, she glances first at me, then at Victorian, and then mumbles under her breath.</p><p>\u201cMay God walk with me through this dark place, to my house of prayer,\u201d she says, quietly but audible. Then she moves fast into the little church and disappears behind a thick wooden door that looks as though it has been around since King Arthur.</p><p>\u201cDo many people here speak English?\u201d I ask, and finish my pie.</p><p>\u201cShe wasn\u2019t speaking English.\u201d</p><p>I swallow and wipe my mouth. \u201cWhat was she speaking then?\u201d</p><p>Victorian grins. \u201cRomanian. Seems like you\u2019ve picked up a little trait from my father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d I answer. \u201cCan\u2019t wait to see what else pops up.\u201d I stand and look around. \u201cAll right, Vic. I\u2019m gonna head out.\u201d I give him a quick look. \u201cI need a little time alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d Victorian says, and leans close. He lays a hand against my shoulder. \u201cThere\u2019s something else I should warn you about.\u201d</p><p>I give him a skeptical look. \u201cWhat else could there be? That I now have three powerful strigoi bloodlines converging with my own? Yes, I know. Yes, I\u2019ll be careful\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou may experience things,\u201d Victorian says, ignoring my rant. \u201cOut-of-body type of things. You will see more than just through another\u2019s eyes,\u201d he says seriously. \u201cYou\u2019ll actually be there. Or so it will seem.\u201d</p><p>My mind doesn\u2019t grasp this at once. \u201cYou mean...like becoming two people? Me and someone else?\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head. \u201cNo. Almost like...converging with another\u2019s soul. You\u2019ll be inside of them, hearing, seeing, feeling everything that they do. Only they won\u2019t know you\u2019re there.\u201d</p><p>I rub first my eyes, then my forehead. \u201cThat\u2019s...sick. Any way I can avoid it?\u201d</p><p>A small smile tips the corner of Victorian\u2019s mouth. \u201cHardly. But you can learn, over time, how to control it. You\u2019ll have to. Because although the soul and body you\u2019re visiting can\u2019t hear or see you, they feel your emotions. Whatever you experience, they experience.\u201d He shrugs. \u201cIf you\u2019re frightened, they\u2019re frightened. Heart rate speeds up, breathlessness, adrenaline.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Again, he smiles, and it\u2019s more of a regretful type of smile than anything else. \u201cBecause it\u2019s what the strongest of the strigoi are capable of. They do it on purpose to gain control of their victims.\u201d</p><p>I think on that for a moment, and then look at Victorian. \u201cThanks for the heads-up.\u201d</p><p>He nods. \u201cI will see you later, love. Be careful. And watch for the bears and wolves.\u201d</p><p>The feeling that I need to heed way more than Romanian carnivores strikes me full force as I take off at a slight jog along the path out of the village.</p><p>I run toward the ridgeline of the Carpathians in a hurry.</p><p>To what end? I have no freaking idea.</p><p>Part Six</p><p>NEWBLOOD</p><p>I thought Miles was bullshitting me when he told me about Riley Poe. Damn if he wasn\u2019t right. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve ever met as strong a woman\u2014human or otherwise\u2014like her. Good thing, too, since most experienced humans with tendencies would have a hard fucking time handling three strigoi bloodlines. Bad thing, though, is she has no idea what\u2019s coming. Eli says she can handle it. Noah Miles swears I\u2019ll enjoy watching her handle it. Little does Riley Poe know that she\u2019s about to merge more into my world than she ever dreamed. I\u2019d be a liar if I said I wasn\u2019t looking forward to it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2014Jake Andorra</p><p>The one thing that I severely notice as I run is that my heart maybe beats about ten times per minute. I\u2019m pretty sure any cardiologist would love to see that in action. I guess I\u2019m lucky the damn thing beats at all.</p><p>As I slip into the forest on another worn path leading up and through the dense wood, Victorian\u2019s words echo in my head. \u201c...although the soul and body you\u2019re visiting can\u2019t hear or see you, they feel your emotions. Whatever you experience, they experience.\u201d I\u2019ve sort of had that already. Valerian\u2019s thoughts and actions were ones I could see, and feel, right after he was released from his tomb and started preying on innocents. I could feel what they felt, see what they saw, but I was me. I tried to warn them, to run, but they couldn\u2019t hear anything. I couldn\u2019t control them, either. I was an invisible bystander, but I couldn\u2019t stay out of the situation. Hopefully, with this, I\u2019ll learn. I can\u2019t imagine just...falling into someone\u2019s body. Into their psyche. That\u2019s utterly weird.</p> <p>The dark bracken crackles beneath my booted feet as I run through the wood. I pick up speed\u2014which seems to grow faster than ever with each step. I mean, ridiculously fast. So much that the trees and bushes and rocks blur. My reflexes are lightning fast, and I impress myself by not slamming into even one low-lying limb. I bound off trees and rock, and leap over anything within my path. I feel strong. I feel good. Fucking good.</p><p>I don\u2019t know how long I run, but it\u2019s a damn long time. What little light filters through the trees begins to fade; the mist grows thicker. I slow my pace. I\u2019m completely lost and I don\u2019t even care because somehow, I\u2019m fearless, even here. I can find my way back. I glance upward, through the canopy of leaves, and watch a crescent moon begin its ascent.</p><p>I feel his presence before I see him, so I slow, then stop.</p><p>Eli emerges from behind the trunk of an aged fir tree and I feel the adrenaline surge through me. Just seeing him does that to me, and I can\u2019t explain it other than that he makes me feel. It seems so long since we\u2019ve been together, and to myself, I admit: I miss him. Miss the hell out of him, actually. I know that what he did, he did for me. For my benefit alone, not for him or anyone else. No way could I ever stay angry at that, and I\u2019m not so sure why I was so pissed to begin with. No, that\u2019s a fat lie. I do know why. Because he freaking bit me. I do understand why, though. I know he did it because he loves me. Deeply. I get that.</p><p>As Eli stands, he says nothing. Only stares. And waits. The wood surrounding us is wildly alive, yet acutely silent. Suddenly, his presence overwhelms me. It almost...crowds me.</p> <p>His eyes say everything.</p><p>Instinctively, I go to him. As if I\u2019m just laying eyes on him for the very first time, I\u2019m drawn to his scent, his eyes, the shape of his jaw, the fall of his hair. He mesmerizes me, and yet now, I know him. I know his behavior. I know what\u2019s in the heart he swears he doesn\u2019t even have. I know his soul that he swears is hell bound. He\u2019s wrong about that. Never have I met a more caring soul. I crave him even more than before.</p><p>The moon, rising higher, bathes Eli in a silvery hue, making him look like the surreal, mystical, cryptic vampire he is.</p><p>Every bit the fierce and loyal vampire he truly is.</p><p>Magnificent.</p><p>It makes my heart race.</p> <p>A biting wind whips through the air, stirring the canopy above, and carrying with it anticipation, excitement, as though the wild Carpathians knew what was up, what was about to occur, and waved their encouragement.</p><p>An ancient feel accompanies that wind, and it makes a tingle cross my spine, wrap around each vertebra, and nip. I\u2019ve gone too long without Eli, without feeling like myself, and although I don\u2019t even know who myself is anymore, there is one constant now that feels right. Him. I shiver, and Eli grasps my fingers as though he knows, without words, without being able to read my mind, what I feel. He probably does. Silently, we walk. I\u2019m not sure how long we walk like that, fingers laced, shoulders brushing, but it\u2019s a while. How Eli knows where he\u2019s going is a mystery to me. I simply trust him and soon, a small stone lodge appears. Smoke trails from a single chimney. It\u2019s not the same place he\u2019d taken me to before. Without a word, he leads me up the walk and through the front door. Inside, all is dark except the embers burning red in the hearth.</p><p>He retrieves a large quilt thrown over the back of a sofa, and he lays it on the floor in front of the fire. Kneeling there, he grabs a poker and stokes the embers, adds a log until the flame grows. I stand silently, watching the play of light lick his face, his jaw, and throw his eyes in shadow. To me he is the most breathtaking soul I\u2019ve ever laid eyes on. Then Eli rises and turns. His eyes lock on to mine. We say nothing. Only stare.</p><p>Everything freezes in that moment as Eli stands, staring, the light from the fire glinting off his hungry eyes. Ancient eyes that know secrets, have powers, have seen so many things. He could have anything and anyone in the world that he wanted. A rich, high society, untarnished young woman, maybe.</p><p>Yet, he chooses to be here, with me. With me and all of my tarnishes.</p><p>My pulse quickens, as fast as it will anyway, and blood rushes on powerful thrusts in my veins as I lock eyes with his. Eli\u2019s muscular chest rises and falls in a rapid, irregular rhythm, his jaw flexing, making the shadows jump on his face.</p><p>\u201cTake off your boots and socks.\u201d</p><p>I blink. Before, my first reaction to the blatant, male command would have been go fuck yourself. Only Eli all but quivers with forced restraint, and he doesn\u2019t command me as a domineering barbarian or a mind-controlling vampire, but as a wild, hungry Alpha who\u2019s just found a delectable morsel he wishes to savor, make last, instead of gobbling it up.</p> <p>Without a word, I toe off my boots. Since I have no socks, I now stand with bare feet on the smooth wood floor.</p><p>\u201cYour jeans.\u201d</p><p>Heat pools in my lower stomach as I unclasp each button, keeping my eyes on Eli\u2019s. So erotic a feeling, him watching my fingers work the buttons loose, that when my thumb brushes my panties, just inside the fly, it makes me shudder. I stifle a gasp, and wish it was Eli\u2019s hand there instead. Now. Not later.</p><p>Eli\u2019s nostrils flare.</p><p>The last button undone, I ease the material over my hips, the feel of soft worn denim scraping my permanently smooth legs, giving me goose bumps. I drop the jeans to the floor, then step out of them.</p><p>\u201cKick them aside.\u201d</p><p>I kick them.</p><p>\u201cTake off your shirt. Slowly.\u201d</p><p>With a ragged breath, I unsnap my long-sleeved shirt, pull my arms out, and drop it. Grasping the hem of my tank top I lift it, one inch at a time, over my stomach, ribs, then over my head. I drop it atop my pile of clothes.</p><p>For a moment, Eli simply stares. He licks those full, sensual lips, catches the bottom one between his teeth, then swallows.</p><p>\u201cYour bra. Don\u2019t take it all the way off. Just unclasp it.\u201d</p><p>I glance down and reach for the clasp.</p><p>\u201cLook at me.\u201d</p><p>Lifting my head, I keep my gaze on Eli\u2019s as I finger the small metal clasp between my breasts. My breathing becomes more rapid, watching him stare at me like a ravaged animal, his sexy French accent deepening to a primal, barely controlled tone each time he speaks a command.</p><p>Wetness dampens my panties, so turned on am I by Eli\u2019s blatant display of desire and control. I throb with need, just below the very thin surface of the silk material covering me. I wait, watch, anticipate. I want.</p><p>Eli steps closer, then slowly circles me, the air stirring from his body\u2019s movement the only part of him touching me. His alluring scent envelops me, drugs me, and I fight to keep my eyes from rolling back in my head with desire. God, I want him yesterday.</p><p>He leans close and smells me, but keeps moving in a slow, predatory ring, almost as though he was staking his claim, marking his territory, stalking his prey. Then, in a deep, purred whisper, tinged with French, he brushes my ear with his lips.</p><p>\u201cAre you wet for me, Riley?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I answer, my breath ragged.</p><p>He keeps moving, his boyish fall of dark hair brushing my bare shoulder as he leans close, making me shiver. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time, Ri. This time, no interruptions.\u201d He stops behind me, his head close to my ear, his whisper a deep purr. Yet we\u2019re still not touching, and it sends vibrations of pleasure across my skin. \u201cI\u2019m going to bury myself deep inside of your tight wetness, feel your muscles grip my hard length as you take all of me in,\u201d he whispers erotically and licks my lobe, his breath caressing my cheek. \u201cMake me come. But first,\u201d he says, his raspy words vibrating against my throat, making me shiver with excitement, \u201cI\u2019m going to make you lose control right where you stand.\u201d</p><p>Never have I been so worked up, so turned on. Every nerve ending hums with power, ready to unleash the energy simmering in my veins. So erotic are his words, his voice, his promise, that sexy accent, I have to clench my female muscles to keep from coming right then. I reach for him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch me, Riley. Just feel.\u201d</p><p>He moves behind me, still fully clothed, and brushes my hair to the side. His mouth hovers over my skin, his breath coming in light puffs, and then the wet velvet of his tongue strokes me where his breath has just been. He trails my spine with his lips, his teeth, his tongue making small circles against each vertebra, and I clench my fists, aching to touch him, but I manage control and keep them by my side. Fiery liquid pools between my legs, making me pulsate with desire. \u201cEli, please...\u201d</p><p>Finally, he touches me. His hands skim my calves, up my outer thighs, over my hips, inches up my ribs. Not the place I want to be touched. I\u2019m nearing the breaking point, and at any second am going to use whatever powers I have to throw his ass on the floor.</p><p>\u201cChrist, you\u2019re beautiful,\u201d he whispers close to my ear, sending another wave of shivers through my taut body. His hands move to my shoulders and push my bra straps down, the soft silk cups catching on my breasts. Slowly, he slides them over the tightened peaks.</p><p>His sharp intake of air is a small victory.</p><p>I don\u2019t know how much more I can take. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I want it to go on forever.</p><p>Eli\u2019s large hands close over my breasts as his mouth claims that portion where my neck meets my shoulder. His thumbs brush the hardened, sensitive tips, and my head drops back to rest against his chest. A moan escapes me.</p><p>He moves his leg between mine. \u201cSettle back against me, Riley.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m out of my mind with need right now, and I do exactly what he asks, and the full erection pressing into the small of my back makes me moan again.</p><p>His lips scrape my jaw, the rough scruff of his stubbled cheek grazing my skin; then he moves his mouth to my ear. \u201cI want to see how ready you are for me. Can you stand it?\u201d</p><p>Between breaths, I shiver and whisper, \u201cCan you?\u201d</p><p>A low growl rumbles deep in Eli\u2019s throat. \u201cBe still.\u201d</p><p>Keeping one hand possessively cupped over my breast, Eli slides his other hand over the flat of my stomach, over one hip, then slips under the low waist of my silk panties.</p> <p>The moment he touches me, an uncontrolled growl of desire tears from my throat.</p><p>\u201cChrist, Riley,\u201d he says, holding his hand still against my wetness. His whisper turns hoarse. \u201cNow.\u201d He dips inside of me with one finger, holding me tight against him, and his lips press and suckle against my throat. I suck in a raw breath and hold it, squeeze my eyes shut, and struggle not to explode against Eli\u2019s hand.</p><p>It doesn\u2019t work.</p><p>A gradual climax, one pulse at a time, increases with each beat, with each movement of his hand against me, until I turn and press my face against his shoulder as the orgasm claims me. Slowly, it subsides.</p><p>Without another word, Eli lifts me and lays me on the quilt before the fire.</p><p>Damn it, I didn\u2019t want to lose control. I couldn\u2019t help it. I wanted the moment to go on forever.</p> <p>The erotic fire quickly rekindles as I watch Eli strip his clothes away.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t tease, doesn\u2019t do it slow, doesn\u2019t put on a show. Centuries-old vampire or not, he\u2019s still one hundred percent male, and he yanks his shirt over his head, toes off his boots and socks, unbuttons his jeans, and kicks them off. He\u2019s totally bare under the worn denim. My heart leaps.</p><p>Bathed in the amber glow of the fire, Eli stands tall, thick, muscular and powerful, worthy of his ancient heritage, of what Fate led him to be, and volts of energy shimmer off his body in sizzling waves. His hair hangs loose and disheveled, making him seem wild, untamed, and I easily drum up a vision of him two hundred years ago, in a white linen shirt with laces at the throat, tight breeches, and high black boots. The beauty of the vision sucks the air from my lungs.</p><p>Eli eases down beside me, pulls me close.</p><p>\u201cCome here, ch\u00e8re.\u201d</p><p>I inch closer, eyes locked, something more than lust propelling me. Inexplicable. I push it to the far corners of my brain and just accept Eli, the man.</p><p>\u201cLook at me.\u201d</p><p>I do.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t offer you normalcy, Riley Poe.\u201d He brushes my cheek with his knuckle. \u201cThings will never be normal for us. But I can offer you whatever soul I have left in me. It\u2019s yours. Forever.\u201d</p><p>I watch the firelight flicker in the depths of his blue eyes. \u201cI know,\u201d I answer, and I did know. There was nothing else that could be said. Somehow, we understand each other, and that\u2019s all that matters. Now, anyway.</p><p>With the pad of his thumb, he traces my lips, hooking the corner, then lowering his mouth to mine, urging it open. Our tongues meet, slow, exploring at first, and then he breaks the kiss, angles my head, and moves his mouth over my throat. Sensations ripple through me. The lack of fear that a vampire hovers over my artery doesn\u2019t faze me. Eli\u2019s unique taste settles on my tongue, making me crave more.</p><p>Eli gives it. He rolls over me, bracing his weight on his elbows. His eyes sear into mine.</p><p>\u201cHold on to me, Riley. Lock your legs around my waist.\u201d</p><p>As I slide my legs around his waist, he eases into my slick wetness with one swift push, burying himself all the way inside. I gasp, moaning as my feminine muscles stretch and accommodate. I almost come again.</p><p>\u201cPut your arms around my neck,\u201d he whispers.</p><p>When I do, his mouth claims mine, devours me, his tongue tasting every corner. He moves his hips, pulling himself almost all the way out, then thrusting back deep inside. His motions mimic his tongue, both making love, and I hook my ankles around his waist and move with him.</p><p>He thrusts faster, once, twice, a third time and I close my eyes as darts of heat flash my skin, and behind my eyes light erupts. Waves of powerful orgasm break over me, my muscles contract, pulse, and squeeze in an unstoppable rush. A moan rips from my throat on a ragged breath.</p><p>Eli\u2019s body jerks as his own climax convulses him, the muscles in his stomach flexing with each thrust, the vein in his neck thick and protruding. His movements finally slowly ease, and he wraps his arms around me tightly. He kisses my mouth in a slow, erotic movement of possession. He kisses my throat, makes my head tilt back, and he gently licks the small hollow where my pulse beats.</p><p>With one hand, Eli palms the back of my head, bringing our mouths a whisper apart. He stares, the firelight licking his skin, and he kisses me deeply, then brushes whispered words against my ear from a language I don\u2019t know, words I had no understanding of. I didn\u2019t dare ask their meaning.</p><p>Suddenly, they register.</p><p>I will love you forever.</p><p>Slowly, I wrap my arms around Eli and press my body as close to his as I can. I feel every inch of him against me, and there\u2019s not an ounce of flesh not claimed by him. Grasping his jaw with my fingers, I pull his head close, my lips to his ear.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll love you forever, too,\u201d I whisper back.</p><p>When Eli pulls away and looks at me, surprise first fills his cerulean blue eyes. It\u2019s quickly followed by more love than I\u2019d ever hoped to find. One corner of his mouth lifts in the sexiest grin I\u2019ve ever seen.</p><p>Then, he kisses me. I feel every ounce of love in that kiss.</p><p>If nothing else stays with me for all of my days, I hope this moment in time does. This kiss. The look in Eli\u2019s eyes. God almighty, I pray it does.</p><p>For the first time in...Jesus, I can\u2019t even remember, I fall asleep in Eli\u2019s arms.</p><p>There is blood. A lot of it. There are screams filled with terror. I feel him, I know who it is without even looking, or without seeing his face. And I know it\u2019s me he wants. Somehow, he knows what\u2019s inside of me now. Not just his DNA, or his brother\u2019s, but...more. His desire for me feels sexual, but I know it\u2019s way more than that. He not only wants my sex, he wants my soul. Wants my blood. Wants my life.</p><p>I remain...wherever this place is, and I can feel the pain and terror of those around me. Valerian is torturing them to torture me. He won\u2019t stop. He\u2019ll never stop.</p><p>Unless I stop him.</p><p>\u201cAre you awake, ch\u00e8re?\u201d</p><p>My eyes flutter open. I feel the adrenaline pushing through my veins and the deathly slow beat of my heart.</p><p>Then, Eli\u2019s face, hovering above mine. Safety. Contentment. Desire. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m awake.\u201d Lifting a hand, I stroke his dark stubble-dusted jaw with my knuckle. \u201cWhy? You want something, Dupr\u00e9?\u201d I smile.</p><p>Settling his lips over mine, Eli nudges my mouth with his and kisses me slowly. \u201cHell yeah, I want something. But so does Julian Arcos.\u201d He kisses my nose. \u201cAnd my father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know why,\u201d I say, and move from the quilt. The embers from the night\u2019s fire smolder in the hearth. \u201cValerian. He knows about me. We need to get back home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s go,\u201d Eli says, and pulls his jeans on.</p><p>We hurry, dress, Eli smothers the embers in the fireplace, and we leave the cottage.</p><p>\u201cDupr\u00e9, Poe,\u201d Noah Miles says with his cocky grin and strange mercury eyes. \u201cNice you could make it.\u201d</p><p>Eli ignores his friend and moves by him. As I follow to do the same, Noah\u2019s eyes lock with mine. The corner of his mouth lifts. \u201cMiss me?\u201d he says.</p><p>I jam my elbow in his ribs. \u201cHardly.\u201d</p><p>Noah laughs and puts a hand over his heart. \u201cYou wound me, Poe.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head and follow Eli into the foyer. Suddenly he turns, stops, and slips my hand into his. \u201cI forget you were out of it most of the time you were here,\u201d he says, glancing down at me. \u201cStay with me. Closely. And try not to start any fights.\u201d</p><p>I just stare at him, and he grins and leads me into what is hands down the epitome of what Hollywood would consider Dracula\u2019s castle. Dark. Gothic. Ominous. Brass sconces embedded into the stone walls hiss and flicker as we pass, and large tapestries stretch from floor to ceiling. Long beam wooden rafters crisscross overhead, and ornate chandeliers cast a low amber light over the massive room. The fireplace, large enough for three people to stand upright in, takes up one whole wall. A group of people stand there, four men and two women, none of whom I\u2019ve ever met. We move toward them.</p><p>As we near, a big man who seems to be addressing the group turns and faces us. He wears his nearly waist-long black hair straight and pulled into a ponytail. Green eyes meet mine and fasten. I can tell he\u2019s weighing me. Probably trying his damnedest to read my freaking mind. Good luck with that, Tonto.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve missed a button,\u201d he says to me, and inclines his head toward my shirt. I ignore him and meet his stare wordlessly.</p><p>He smiles, and I\u2019ll admit right here and now: the man is ridiculously sexy.</p><p>\u201cRiley, this is Jake Andorra,\u201d Eli introduces. \u201cJake, stop being an ass.\u201d</p><p>Jake inclines his head. \u201cMy apologies,\u201d he says without breaking his stare, and I notice he has an odd accent. Not Romanian. Not French. Something else. Something old.</p><p>\u201cPict,\u201d he whispers close to my ear. \u201cAnd Tonto would\u2019ve never made it out of here alive.\u201d</p><p>I lift a brow. \u201cNice. Now stay out of my head.\u201d</p><p>Chuckles break the silence of the others.</p><p>\u201cJake runs WUP\u2014Worldwide Unexplained Phenomena,\u201d Eli explains. \u201cHe\u2019s not used to being one-upped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not yet still,\u201d Jake corrects. \u201cNice to finally meet you, Riley Poe.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got a great house,\u201d I say, remembering the beautiful manor home on Charleston\u2019s battery. \u201cSo what do you want with me?\u201d I ask bluntly.

Eleven Celtae druids lay dead, their bodies entangled within their black robes.</p><p>\u201cWhat we had to do,\u201d Darius answered. He rose and met the questioning eyes of the younger Druthan. \u201cThe dark magick within the Dubh Seiagh is unimaginable. The Celtae used it, Ronan. To allow them to live would mean destruction for us all.\u201d</p> <p>Ronan nodded and wiped a streak of blood from his cheek.</p><p>Just then, a sharp gust of wind swept over the moor, stirring the robes of the dead, and a blanket of mist settled over the browned and bloodstained heather. The twilight\u2019s dim glow made the desolate moor hazy, and thunder crackled in the distance. Darius glanced up. \u201cWe havena much time.\u201d</p><p>As the wind grew fiercer, the other Druthan warriors gathered, making their way through the fallen Celtae to stand at Darius\u2019s side.</p><p>Darius met each of his brethren\u2019s gazes. \u201cYou know what must be done. Four of our future kinsmen will become the immortal Arbitrators. I sacrifice my own bloodline. Who else?\u201d</p><p>Three more Druthans raised their hands without hesitation.</p><p>\u201cWell done,\u201d Darius said.</p> <p>\u201cWhat of the Archivist? Whose bloodline will he come from?\u201d asked Ronan.</p><p>\u201cNone of ours.\u201d</p><p>The wind screamed then, and Darius quickly muttered the ancient Pict verse that would name the Arbitrators twelve hundred years into the future. And, the Archivist, centuries beyond. By that time, the language of the Dubh Seiagh would be dead and forgotten. Only the Archivist would have the ability to read it. Thus, destroy it. Until then, it would stay forever hidden.</p><p>When the last word was spoken, a deathly silence fell over the moor.</p><p>It was done.</p><p>As the Drutha glanced around, gasps filled the still night air. Darius hurried to the first Celtae body and knelt down.</p><p>\u2018Twas as though every ounce of bone and muscle and matter had been sucked out of the Celtae\u2019s skin, leaving it a flat and empty sack of cauterized flesh.</p><p>Just then a scream, high-pitched and chilling to the bone, ripped over the moor, followed by another, and another, over and over. The wind picked up once again and roared through the air with gale force.</p> <p>\u201cDarius!\u201d Ronan yelled. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d</p><p>Darius closed his eyes.</p><p>They\u2019d killed the Celtae.</p><p>But their souls had escaped...</p><p>Quickly, he mouthed another verse, unrehearsed, unplanned. Desperate.</p><p>And prayed with fervor that it worked.</p><p>As fast as it occurs, it stops. Only now do I realize the scene lasted only a few seconds\u2014as long as it takes Darius to shake my hand. The second he releases me, the vision disappears. My head is spinning as vertigo grabs me. A small wave of nausea washes over me, and for a minute I think I\u2019m going to barf all over the guy. Surprisingly, after a few deep breaths, it subsides.</p><p>I look at him wordlessly. He\u2019s tall, muscular, with dark auburn hair pulled back much like Jake\u2019s, and disturbing, ancient amber eyes. The vision I\u2019d witnessed was from a long time ago. I\u2019d been nothing more than a fly on the wall, watching.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you see?\u201d he asks quietly.</p><p>I look at him. \u201cEverything. You, others, on a windy moor, blood,\u201d I say. \u201cYou killed the others. You instructed them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t understand.\u201d A woman I hadn\u2019t noticed before moves closer to me. \u201cThere\u2019s more to it,\u201d she insists.</p><p>\u201cMs. Maspeth,\u201d another big guy warns.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Sydney,\u201d she says, looking at me with an almost desperate look. She\u2019s blond, pretty, yet...harsh at the same time. Sort of like me, I guess. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>Then, she places her hand on my shoulder.</p><p>And the whole goddamn thing starts over again.</p><p>This time, though, it\u2019s different.</p><p>I feel myself waver, as though I\u2019m going to fall, but instead of falling straight onto the floor, I just keep falling, falling, until I suddenly stop. A faint light, starting as a pinpoint in the distance and growing larger as it moves toward me, makes my vision go from blurry to clear. When I blink, I\u2019m still me. But I\u2019m somewhere else. I feel...enclosed. Trapped. And I\u2019m looking through eyes not my own...</p><p>Niddry\u2019s in Old Town, Edinburgh, has always felt safe to me. Small, dark, and nondescript, it\u2019s a pub very few tourists ever venture into. Low-lit alcoves line the ancient stone walls of the building, and Victorian-era lamps, emitting a soft glow, perch on tabletops. It allows me to blend in with the local working class of the city, drink a few pints, to feel somewhat normal for a short period of time.</p><p>It allows me, even for just a few moments, to forget.</p><p>The glass feels cool against my palms as I lift it to my mouth, and the dark lager slips smoothly down my throat. Draining the glass, I set it down on the chipped mahogany table and glance at the other Niddry\u2019s patrons from my alcove. Most I recognize, like the three off-duty cops\u2014two of them brothers\u2014 the owner of the chip shop just up the street, and a handful of students from the university. A cab driver\u2014this one I recognize because I\u2019ve used his service before\u2014sits at the bar nursing his third whiskey. Two women who work at the Safeway up the street sit together at a table close to the bar, giggling and sharing some inside joke. Normal, everyday folk living their normal, everyday lives.</p><p>I stare down at my empty glass, at the impression my lips leave on the rim, and then out the window to the rain-dampened sidewalk. A streetlamp blinks and then turns on. It will be dark soon. The gray will become black.</p><p>And these people have no fucking clue what\u2019s really out there...</p><p>\u201cAnother pint, miss?\u201d</p><p>The bartender, Seth, stands there with a white cloth thrown over his shoulder, smiling. His grin is welcoming, friendly, the dimple in his left cheek giving him a boyish look. He wags his reddish brown brows and widens his smile.</p><p>I smile back. \u201cOne more, thanks.\u201d</p><p>He gives a nod, makes his way back to the bar, retrieves another lager, and brings it back. \u201cHere then, lass.\u201d</p><p>As he makes his way back to his station behind the long, polished mahogany bar, I find myself thinking how lucky the guy is, how lucky they all are, to be so oblivious to what lies beyond the doors of the pub.</p><p>Sometimes, I wish I were oblivious, too.</p><p>Taking a long pull on the lager, I continue to stare through the window. Despite the cold October rain, passersby scurry up and down the sidewalk, their overcoats swishing around their legs, on their way home from work, probably, or headed to their favorite meeting place with friends to have a few drinks.</p><p>I remember similar carefree evenings, when I would meet with friends, or go to my parents\u2019 house with my fianc\u00e9 for dinner, or simply stop by the mall to shop for a new outfit. I never even thought for a second how my life could change so drastically. How I would never see my family again, rely on my mother\u2019s comforting hug, fall into my fianc\u00e9\u2019s easy embrace.</p><p>But that sounds selfish, doesn\u2019t it? Selfish and childish. Me, me, me.</p><p>Strangely enough, I\u2019m really not so bitter anymore. But in the beginning? When everything first happened? Jesus, I was a hateful bitch. I didn\u2019t want to accept what had happened to me, or what I was to become.</p><p>What I am now.</p><p>With my fingertip, I wipe a streak through the moisture gathered on the glass, then I lift it up to drink. Over the rim I see one of the cops looking at me. He gives a smile and a brief nod. He\u2019s cute, and there once was a time when I would have indulged in an innocent flirtation. Not anymore. So I meet his gaze for a moment, then look away, back to the outside. The constant drizzle is falling harder now. I think it rains every damn day here.</p><p>It\u2019s been nearly a year since I came to Edinburgh. God, when I think of who I was before, such a short time ago, it nearly makes me laugh. I am so different now. Before, I was innocent, na\u00efve. Sweet. Fun-loving. Carefree. I baked cakes, for Christ\u2019s sake. I don\u2019t bake anymore.</p><p>Not even a shadow of who I used to be is present now.</p><p>I drain my glass and wipe my mouth. It\u2019s funny\u2014I can sit here all night and drink as much as I want, and never get drunk. I can smoke two packs of cigarettes a day and I\u2019ll never get cancer. I don\u2019t gain weight, nor do I lose it. I don\u2019t get wrinkles. My hair doesn\u2019t grow. I can\u2019t catch a cold, the flu, tuberculosis, Ebola\u2014I\u2019m immune to all of it.</p><p>Thanks to my destiny, I\u2019m immune to death.</p><p>My fate is unchangeable. But mankind\u2019s is\u2014and it\u2019s up to me to make it happen. So when I have moments of self-pity, like the one I\u2019m having now, I slip over to Niddry\u2019s and steal a few moments alone, before Gabriel, my mentor, seeks me out. I...reflect. I give myself a scant few moments to mourn my old life, to miss my mom and dad, my sisters, my granny and grandpa. It helps somewhat. Time, Gabriel says, will ease the pain.</p><p>I finally stopped crying over my fianc\u00e9. For some reason, his love was easier to let go of than it should have been. We were only two months shy of marriage, yet...I mourned him very little. I suppose that\u2019s a good thing for me. I try not to dwell on that too much, though. I\u2019ve come to realize that dwelling on the past serves absolutely no useful purpose anyway. I do what I have to do now so that my loved ones can survive. So everyone can survive. It\u2019s up to me. Only me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Well, me and the other four Druthans.</p><p>My vision blurs as I stare at the lamppost outside, and at the torrent of rain pouring down. A few more minutes and then I\u2019ll go. Until then, I\u2019ll catch you up to speed on things, to where my life is now. Maybe, you\u2019ll understand.</p><p>I\u2019ll spare you a long, boring history of me before Scotland. Suffice it to say I was your average American girl. I was born twenty-five years ago to James and Lucinda Maspeth. They named me Sydney Jane, after my mom\u2019s grandparents. I grew up on the Outer Banks of North Carolina. I went to UNC, graduated with a B.S. in education, and started teaching first grade in Kitty Hawk. I frequented the spa. I got my nails done every other week.</p> <p>All that changed one May afternoon when Gabriel\u2014an imposing wall of sheer muscle clothed in head-to-toe black\u2014walked easily into my empty classroom, right up to the desk where I sat grading papers, pulled me out of my chair, looked me dead in the eye, and with a sincere apology, slipped a silver blade into my heart.</p><p>I died in his arms.</p><p>I awakened sometime later\u2014weeks later, actually\u2014in his bed. He sat in a dark alcove, watching me with those silvery eyes. I\u2019ll never forget that first brooding, profound stare. To me it sums up his entire character. Silent power barely checked.</p><p>In a matter-of-fact tone, and with a mesmerizing accent, he told me my old life was gone, and that I was now immortal, like him. He told me to rest, that I was still going through the transformation and was very weak. Then he stood, tossed a newspaper on the bed beside me, and left the room without another word.</p><p>One thing I learned pretty fast about Gabriel\u2014he speaks very little, but when he does, it\u2019s potent.</p> <p>The newspaper proved to be one from back home in Kitty Hawk. It was the Obituary page, and as I thumbed through it I found my own smiling face staring back at me.</p><p>Fishing a few pounds from the pocket above my knee, I put down a tip, nod to Seth who smiles in return, and make my way through the small crowd. The rain is only a drizzle now, and Gabriel is probably waiting for me. At the doorway, I slip my arms into my black trench coat, button it up, and put on a black skully and scarf. Funny. I go from sandals, French manicures, and flowery sundresses to black fatigues, boots, and a trench coat. I look like goddamn Mission: Impossible. My sisters would die laughing.</p><p>My granny would wash my mouth out with soap.</p><p>I\u2019d give anything to let her.</p><p>I step out into the cool night air and start down the sidewalk, and before I can walk ten feet, someone behind me grabs my arm.</p><p>\u201cJust a minute, miss.\u201d</p> <p>I turn to find the cute cop. He\u2019s medium height and build, with dark, close-clipped hair and wide blue eyes. He gives me a crooked grin. \u201cSorry. I, uh, well, was wonderin\u2019 if you, ya know?\u201d He glances at his feet and mutters, \u201cShite.\u201d He looks me in the eye and smiles again. \u201cI tried to get your attention back there.\u201d He inclines his head toward Niddry\u2019s. \u201cI\u2019m Sean. I, eh, don\u2019t mean to sound so forward, but I noticed\u201d\u2014he gathered courage and met my gaze fully\u2014\u201cwell you looked nice to talk to, is all.\u201d</p><p>I meet his wide blue eyes with my own stare. I never can quite get over how charming the Scottish accent is. Even now, it sucks me right in. Sean\u2019s is a bit thicker than the Edinburgh burr. Glasgow, maybe? Nice.</p><p>In another life, I would be grinning like a fool and batting my eyelashes. Sean\u2019s a good-looking guy, confident, charming. And blessedly ordinary. But I\u2019m no ordinary girl.</p><p>Sean can\u2019t handle me.</p><p>But instead of blowing him off, I stick out my hand. I can\u2019t date him, but a friendly face every now and then in Niddry\u2019s can\u2019t hurt. I smile. \u201cSydney, and it\u2019s nice to meet you.\u201d</p><p>He smiles and shakes my hand. \u201cOch, an American.\u201d He nods toward Niddry\u2019s. \u201cDo you care to step back in? I would have come up to you earlier, but I\u2019m a wee bit shy\u2014\u201d</p><p>Powerful fingers close around my arm and I immediately know who is there. Sean\u2019s gaze rises above my head, directly behind me.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s with me,\u201d Gabriel\u2019s deep voice vibrates above me.</p> <p>Sean glances at me, almost as if looking for an approval of the possessive grasp the newcomer has on me. I give him a slight smile, he shrugs, and returns the smile. Defeat dims his blue gaze. \u201cRight. See ya then, Sydney.\u201d He turns and walks back to Niddry\u2019s.</p><p>Gabriel turns me around, pulls me close and lowers his mouth to my ear. \u201cYou\u2019re late.\u201d The words brush against my ear and I shiver. He has that ability\u2014to unhinge me\u2014but I\u2019ll never let him know it.</p><p>With deft fingers he opens my trench coat and eases my blade from his to my hip. Those mercury eyes never leave mine as he fastens the small scabbard holding the Druthan silver to the loops on my pants and closes my coat. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>He turns and heads up the sidewalk, and I\u2019m right behind him. Gabriel\u2019s posture is guarded, although no one notices but me. I\u2019ve spent nearly an entire year in his daily company. I know his gestures, his habits, and I know when he is on high alert, when his body is on edge. Like now.</p><p>We wind our way through the streets of Old Town. The castle is lit and stands formidable on the rock it was built on. During my training, when I was learning every street, every close, every pub, club, business, and landmark, the castle stood as a focal point, a guide, a beacon. It still does.</p><p>And I now know the streets of Edinburgh like the back of my hand.</p><p>The Druthan blade brushes against my thigh with each step, and I button just the top of my coat, leaving the last two undone. If I need to withdraw my weapon, it has to be fast. I have to be ready. Always ready...</p><p>We\u2019re on the outskirts of Old Town now, and Gabriel takes a turn left and eases down a set of cracked stone steps, between the tight-knit quarters of Pippin\u2019s Close. It\u2019s cold, gray, and deserted. Not derelict, just empty. No one lives here now.</p><p>No one, except the dead.</p><p>I fight a smile as I walk behind Gabriel\u2019s big self. He takes up every inch of the close, and has to turn slightly sideways to fit properly. I know that irritates him, too. It makes him feel vulnerable, as if he can\u2019t protect me fully, if the need arises. But only I know that.</p><p>I hug the wall and continue to follow, through the narrow close and down one more set of steps before coming to a lone door. The thump of a nearby nightclub vibrates on the air, and laughter rings out. But that\u2019s coming from several streets over. No one knows I\u2019m here except Gabriel. And no one knows what is about to happen except us. Briefly, I think of Sean, that cute cop from Niddry\u2019s. I can\u2019t help but wonder what he\u2019d think if he knew.</p><p>Gabriel stops just before the door and looks down at me with that ever-present profound stare. His long hair, nearly black, is pulled back at the nape of his neck and damp from rain. A long strand is caught on his cheek, but he ignores it. The light from a streetlamp finds an opening through the close and falls on part of his face, casting the other part in shadow. He is magnificent and immortal, lethal, and so sexually charged that the air hums with it.</p><p>No, I\u2019m not used to it yet. Even after a year, I have to check myself. But those are the mannerisms of a Druthan warrior, and it has nothing to do with him being a man and me a woman. He cares for me only because of what I am. He is from a secret sect of ancient Pict druids. There are only three others besides Gabriel.</p><p>And they\u2019re nearly five hundred years old.</p><p>So when I say Gabriel is looking at me with an ancient gleam in his eyes, I really mean it.</p><p>His dark brows pull together into a frown. \u201cFinished?\u201d</p><p>I shrug. Yeah, he can read thoughts. He doesn\u2019t stay in my head twenty-four/seven, but when he thinks I\u2019m straying from task, he\u2019ll do it in a heartbeat. Anything to keep me safe. I suppose I should appreciate that. \u201cYes. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t even have to ask what\u2019s going on. Standing here, beneath the eave of Pippin\u2019s Close and by the door of an empty flat, with rain spitting and sputtering against my already damp cheeks, and the cold October air freezing my skin, I know. And if I hadn\u2019t known, the nauseating stench from behind the door would be all the warning I\u2019d need.</p><p>One of them is in there. And it\u2019s feeding.</p><p>I slide in front of Gabriel and press my back to his front, and his body goes rigid, still, with just the smallest movement of lung expansion as he breathes. Goddamn, it\u2019s hard to concentrate in such an intimate position\u2014</p><p>\u201cSteady, lass,\u201d he whispers against my ear.</p><p>As if that helps the situation.</p><p>\u201cI willna be far behind. Now go,\u201d he commands.</p><p>I take a deep breath, withdraw my sword, and I go.</p><p>The door is slightly ajar, so I place my fingertips to the wood and push a space big enough for Gabriel and me to fit through, and I slip inside the dark interior. A tinge of must mingles with the foul smell and nearly makes me gag, but I swallow several times to fight off the urge.</p><p>Reaching into my thigh pocket, I withdraw a small torch. I can hear the familiar gurgling noise, coming from another room near the back, so I feel pretty sure nothing is right before me. My heart slams against my ribs as I sweep the beam of light across the bare floor.</p><p>It falls across a woman\u2019s shoe.</p><p>Jesus Christ.</p><p>As I move toward the back, I feel somewhat comforted that Gabriel is right behind me. Knowing he is there won\u2019t erase from memory what I\u2019m about to witness. That vivid scene, along with the odor, will stay forever emblazoned in my mind.</p><p>My fingers tighten around the sword hilt, and my body tenses as I prepare. I ease toward what I\u2019m pretty sure is the kitchen. The chewing and gurgling sounds grow louder, more intense.</p><p>And then, it stops. Silence.</p><p>It knows I\u2019m here.</p><p>I wait, because I have to have it in full view before I make a move. One wrong step and it\u2019s my shoe on the floor.</p><p>In the next breath, it leaps, landing just a few feet away. It doesn\u2019t see me yet, but I\u2019m pretty sure it can smell me. I can definitely smell it. Vile. There\u2019s no other word for it.</p><p>With the torch off, the room is once again cast into darkness. I can judge where it is, though, and I can hear it, allowing to my vision almost a full outline of its body. Amazing, the senses that have heightened since my death\u2014 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A cold, wet hand closes over my throat, pinching off my air. Its body is close to me now, too close to poke my blade into, too close to punch. So I pull back my leg and shove my knee into its groin, I do it once more, and it finally howls, turns my throat loose, and stumbles back.</p><p>A powerful swoosh slices through the air, followed by a heavy thump. Something bumps the toe of my boot.</p><p>\u201cTorch on, Ms. Maspeth,\u201d Gabriel says directly over my shoulder. \u201cNow.\u201d</p> <p>Immediately, I flip on my torch and point it down.</p><p>The head of a Jodis lies at my feet, a nasty, white ooze spilling from its neck cavity.</p><p>Gabriel pushes past me and steps over the Jodis\u2019s body, which is still twitching. He stops at the kitchen, looks in, and crosses himself, and in ancient Pict, gives what once was an innocent woman her last rites.</p><p>I know the verse by heart now. I\u2019ve heard it scores of times over the last year.</p><p>With God, find peace hereafter.</p> <p>I can do little but breathe. I feel my knees weaken and I stumble back, rest my head against the wall and swear.</p><p>Gabriel holds my chin and lifts it up. I squeeze my eyes shut, out of embarrassment and to hold in the goddamn tears. Even after a year of training, the monster beats me.</p><p>\u201cOpen your eyes, Ms. Maspeth,\u201d he says quietly. \u201cWe have bodies to dispose of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRiley? Wake up.\u201d</p><p>I feel a tight grasp around my shoulder. I\u2019m being shaken. I toss my head a few times, blink, and glance around. I\u2019m back in Castle Arcos. Everyone is staring at me. Sydney Maspeth is standing a foot away. All eyes are on me.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is this?\u201d I say, and back away from them. \u201cDon\u2019t fucking touch me again. Any of you.\u201d I sling my arms as though shaking off water. \u201cDamn it!\u201d I try to clear my head. All I see is Edinburgh, Scotland. That apartment. Sydney. That...thing.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Sydney says. \u201cI honestly didn\u2019t think...I didn\u2019t believe it could happen.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cWell it did. But don\u2019t worry about it,\u201d I say, feeling like someone who has just told a kid there\u2019s no Santa Claus. \u201cNo problem. Just...warn me next time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo \u2019tis true,\u201d the third big guy of the group, whom I recognize as Gabriel, says. \u201cYour blood survived three strigoi?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have normal blood to begin with,\u201d I offer. \u201cAnd if you touch me I will throw your ass through that window,\u201d I say, and incline my head.</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s smile isn\u2019t very noticeable, but it\u2019s there. He simply nods. \u201cAnother time, mayhap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d I answer.</p><p>I slip a quick glance at Eli. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy name\u2019s Ginger Slater,\u201d the other young woman says. She maintains her distance, which I sincerely appreciate. I\u2019m in no mood to slip into anyone else\u2019s body just right now. \u201cWe\u201d\u2014she glances at the man beside her\u2014\u201cwe need your help.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAll of us,\u201d Sydney adds.</p><p>I exhale and glance at Eli. \u201cAgain. What\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>Eli inclines his head to the sofa near the hearth. \u201cSit.\u201d</p><p>With a quick glance at the small group gathered, I concede. I sit.</p><p>And wait.</p><p>Part Seven</p><p>REJUVENATION</p><p>There is something incredibly different about Ginger Slater and Sydney Maspeth. I\u2019m still so busy trying to let my brain wrap around the fact that Victorian was right\u2014one little touch put me directly into Sydney\u2019s body. I saw what she saw. But she felt what I felt. Weird.</p><p>Ginger I\u2019ll keep at arm\u2019s length. Haven\u2019t touched her. I can tell, though, that she is dying to get her little fingers on me. I\u2019m ready for it. I still have processing to do.</p><p>Darius is definitely a different story. He\u2019s old as dirt, although he looks around thirty, and has some sort of magical powers. That much I can tell. Not a vampire. Neither is Gabriel or the one who has done nothing but stare at me. Lucian. There\u2019s something\u2014I don\u2019t know\u2014feral about him. Unpredictable. Frightening, even. Unlike a vampire. This whole thing is strange. And I\u2019m ready to get the hell out of Romania.</p><p>\u201cThese are two of WUP\u2019s most crucial cases right now,\u201d Jake Andorra says. \u201cGinger just lost her partner.\u201d Jake flashes a warning look at Lucian. \u201cAnd inadvertently gained another.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cLost her partner?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a field agent, presently stationed near the village of Dunmorag in the northwest Highlands,\u201d Ginger offers. \u201cRelatively new to WUP, but I\u2019ve been studying shifters ever since high school. We\u2019ve\u201d\u2014she inclines her head toward Lucian\u2014\u201cchased our unsub to the Carpathians.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShifters? Unsub?\u201d I ask.</p><p>Ginger grins. \u201cShape-shifters. Those who can morph from one being to another. Say, from a man into a wolf.\u201d She slides a glance at Lucian. \u201cAnd unsub\u2014that\u2019s the term we give the bad guys.\u201d</p><p>I simply nod.</p><p>\u201cSydney and Gabriel are knee-deep in shit over in Edinburgh,\u201d Jake adds.</p><p>\u201cSo I see,\u201d I answer. I slide a glance to Sydney and Gabriel. She looks like she can handle her own. I admire that.</p><p>Jake chuckles. \u201cAh, so you have. They have their hands full of the Jod\u00eds in Edinburgh. Along with a mortal group who call themselves the Gemini. There seems to be a band of Black Fallens taking over the city.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlack Fallens?\u201d I dare ask.</p><p>Jake nods. \u201cFallen angels. Bad ones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll threatened by nine malevolent spirits Darius there tried to take care of centuries ago,\u201d Sydney adds. \u201cThey were a little smarter than he anticipated.\u201d</p><p>Darius remains silent.</p><p>Rising from my place on the sofa, I pinch the bridge of my nose, shake my head, then meet Jake Andorra\u2019s gaze. \u201cFascinating. Really. All of it.\u201d I step closer, tilt my head, and look up at him. \u201cBut what\u2019s any of this got to do with me?\u201d</p><p>Out of the corner of my eye, I see Eli lean closer to me.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Jake continues, and his green eyes all but glow as they stare down at me. \u201cI was hoping to offer you employment once all of your present matters are handled.\u201d</p><p>I gape. I glance at Eli, who shrugs. Then I move my gaze back to Jake. \u201cI\u2019m a tattoo artist. I own an ink shop. I\u2019m raising my little brother. That\u2019s what I do.\u201d</p><p>Jake merely smiles. \u201cYou\u2019ve too many...capabilities, Riley. Way too many to waste. You\u2019d be the perfect addition to our team.\u201d</p><p>I open my mouth to retort, but Jake holds up his hand. \u201cJust...think about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve thought about it. No.\u201d I move away from him, because, really, I don\u2019t trust him.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d Ginger says, and steps toward me. \u201cSeriously, Riley, think about it.\u201d</p><p>Then goddamn it all, she does it. She grasps my arm before I can snatch it back. The room spins, my eyes cross, and everything goes blurry once again....</p><p>\u201cSo, you think you can handle this one, huh, newbie?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d glanced at Paxton Tarragon, the arrogant senior field agent I\u2019d been training with for the past three months. He had been in his mid-thirties, had worn white, spiked hair, and had looked like Billy Idol. I\u2019d narrowed my gaze, sick to death of being called newbie. The only thing I\u2019d hated worse than that was being called blondie. Typical straight blond hair and blue eyes had been roadblocks in my career. No guy took a blonde seriously. Then add in the name Ginger? I\u2019d always had to prove myself. Bastards. \u201cHell yeah.\u201d</p><p>My conversation with Pax replayed in my head more times than I could count. Why had he had to have been so damn cocky? That seemed like a long time ago now.</p><p>Over the course of the next week, Lucian slowly introduced me to my new world, my new body, my new senses. I would not be able to master them all for some time; my hearing was exaggerated and sometimes hurt my ears and insides. My sense of smell was so intense, it overwhelmed me, and I couldn\u2019t determine one smell from another\u2014except for Lucian\u2019s scent. His was unique and solely Lucian\u2019s, and I could detect it a mile away. My strength and speed were immature but growing fast\u2014almost too fast. I tripped, I fell, I hurled myself to speeds which my old body couldn\u2019t handle yet. I busted my ass more times than I could count. But Lucian was right there to help me up.</p><p>Each night, we made intense love and fell asleep wrapped in each other\u2019s arms. Each night, I dreamed. Pax pursued me in his human form, always in a heavy mist, always through a dense wood. The white fog slipped through the trees and brush like long, reaching fingers, and I ran hard, stumbling and not in control of my new speed and strength. Pax, for some reason, was. His white spiked hair appeared behind every tree, every rock, as though he was toying with me. And every time, he\u2019d catch me, back me against the base of a tree. \u201cThis is your fault, newbie. I\u2019m here, trapped as an abomination, all because of you. I don\u2019t know whether to thank you or rip your throat out.\u201d I\u2019d awaken, shaking violently, breathless, just before Pax shifted into his wolf form and lunged at me, teeth bared. I kept the dreams from Lucian. I thought I could handle them, or that they\u2019d just go away. I was so very wrong.</p><p>My arrival in Dunmora, and the events that had followed, haunted me.</p><p>\u201cSo you have a couple of years behind you, and what?\u201d He cocked his head and stared at me. \u201cThink you\u2019re ready?\u201d He\u2019d shaken his head and had popped the hatch. \u201cI\u2019ve been at this for ten years, newbie, and trust me\u2014you\u2019re never ready.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d met Pax\u2019s stare for a few seconds, had told him to eff-off in my head, had grabbed my pack and shouldered it. Then I\u2019d really taken a good look around at the secluded Highland village. \u201cDesolate\u201d was the first word that had come to mind. A half dozen gray stone and whitewashed buildings hugged the pebbled crescent shore of a small lake\u2014or, rather, a loch. Beyond the village, the Rannoch Moors were even more desolate than Dunmorag. Tufts of dead grass, brown heather, and rock stretched for miles. Far in the distance, dark, craggy mountains threw long shadows and loomed ominously. The skies were gray. The moors were gray. Even the water in the loch was gray. Well, black. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cForeboding.\u201d That was the second word that had come to mind.</p><p>\u201cYou gonna stand here all day and take in the scenery or what?\u201d Pax had asked.</p><p>I\u2019d given him a hard look, which he\u2019d ignored, instead inclining his head to the pub behind us. \u201cI\u2019m ready,\u201d I\u2019d said. I had shifted my pack, had snugged my leather jacket\u2019s collar closer to my neck, and together we\u2019d crossed the small car park. The wind bit straight through my clothes, and I\u2019d shivered as I\u2019d stepped onto the single paved walk that ran in front of the stores. I\u2019d glanced down the row of buildings. A baker. A fishmonger. The Royal Post. A grocer. An inn and a pub. And absolutely no people around. Weird. Very, very weird. Good thing weird had been our specialty.</p> <p>A black sign with a sliver of a red moon painted on it had swung above the pub on rusted hinges, and the creaking noise had echoed off the building. In silver letters, the sign read THE BLOOD MOON. Pax had pushed in through the red double doors\u2014quite befitting, the red\u2014and I\u2019d followed. Inside, it had taken my eyes several seconds to adjust to the dimmer light. A hush fell over the handful of people gathered in the single-room dwelling. \u201cGuess we found the villagers,\u201d I\u2019d whispered to Pax. They had stopped what they were doing or saying to stare at us. No one had uttered a word.</p><p>I\u2019d glanced at Pax, then all around, until my eyes had lighted on the man behind the bar. He had dark, expressionless eyes that reminded me of a shark\u2019s eyes, and they\u2019d bored straight into me. His head, shaved bald, had shined beneath the pub\u2019s overhead light. He\u2019d said nothing. I had walked up to him and had met his gaze. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for Lucian MacLoud,\u201d I\u2019d said. \u201cKnow where we can find him?\u201d</p><p>It was weird, mine and Lucian\u2019s relationship. I felt completely at ease with Lucian, as though we\u2019d known each other forever. He\u2019d had nearly three weeks to come to terms with the fact that I was his marked mate; I\u2019d had about twenty-four hours. Still, I accepted it readily and willingly. It felt...natural, as though my life was to turn out no other way than to be here, in the Highlands of Scotland, with an ancient Pict warrior-wolf. It felt even more natural to become a wolf, too. I can\u2019t explain it without sounding like a lunatic, but there you go.</p><p>Lucian and I left the bothy the last day of my transition and traveled north and west to the MacLeod stronghold. Situated on a sea loch, the massive gray stone fortress, complete with four imposing towers, dominated the seascape. It literally stole my breath.</p><p>\u201cYou live here?\u201d I asked incredulously. I glanced at him.</p> <p>Lucian laughed, and reached over and grasped my hand. \u201cNay. We live here.\u201d</p><p>My heart swelled at his words. We\u2019d not exchanged the L-word yet; somehow, it just didn\u2019t seem right. But we\u2019d both claimed each other, and the word \u201cmine\u201d sounded nearly as powerful as, if not more than, the word \u201clove.\u201d There would be an adjustment period for both of us. But one thing of which I was absolutely positive: We were meant to be together.</p><p>Lucian pulled onto a single-track gravel lane that led to the massive front doors of the castle, and before we had the Rover in park, five big guys emptied the entrance and made their way toward us. All had dark hair in various lengths and bodies that looked like they swung axes and swords and kicked ass for a living.</p><p>Lucian glanced at me and laughed. \u201cThey won\u2019t bite.\u201d</p><p>I looked at him and raised a brow. \u201cDoubt that.\u201d</p><p>I climbed out of the Rover, slammed the door, and faced the MacLeods.</p> <p>\u201cGin, my brothers. Arron, Raife, Christopher, Jacob, and Sean.\u201d</p><p>Arron walked up and embraced me; the others followed. \u201cWelcome,\u201d Arron said, his eyes flashing quicksilver.</p><p>\u201cAbout time we had a lass around the place,\u201d Jacob said, and the others laughed.</p><p>The MacLeods welcomed me, and as it was with Lucian, the same held true with his brothers. It felt like I\u2019d known them my entire life.</p><p>The MacLeod fortress entailed no less than two hundred acres and the shoreline, and inside the castle was a modernized habitat befitting an ancient wolf clan of Pict warriors. Primeval mixed perfectly with contemporary. It was mind-numbing to think how long ago Lucian and his brothers were born, how long they\u2019d lived.</p><p>They prepared me for my transition that night; in all honesty, there wasn\u2019t much they could do except stand by and wait, help out if needed. Lucian warned me the first time would be painful, and he apologized more times than I could count. He held me in his arms, kissed me, smoothed my hair from my face, and promised to not leave my side until it was over.</p><p>By nightfall, as the moon began to rise, Lucian and his brothers walked me to the shoreline, encircled me, and waited. I immediately knew it had begun when my skin began to itch. I felt as though I wanted to crawl right out of it, and I clawed and scratched at my arms, my neck, my abdomen. My temperature rose, higher and higher until I thought I would self-combust. My skin was on fire, and I began to pull at my clothes. No matter that it was October in the Highlands; I was hot. I didn\u2019t have time to yank them off, either. I felt my skeleton give way, the popping and rubbing sounds reverberating inside my head. I cried out in pain, and in my peripheral vision I saw movement and knew it was Lucian. He stopped abruptly, and didn\u2019t advance farther.</p><p>My heels and long bones shifted, elongated, contorted, and just when I thought I couldn\u2019t take the pain and heat a second longer, I fell to the ground, let out a low, long bay, and it was over. I leaped up, shook my body, and met the silver gazes of six other wolves, their shaggy dark coats glistening in the moonlight.</p> <p>We ran that night, my new brothers, my mate, and I. We ran from the west coast of Scotland clear to the east, along the shores of the North Sea, and it was invigorating, mind-freeing. My new body rocked with sensations, and I wanted to keep running. I saw everything through my new eyes, and it was as though I was seeing the world for the very first time. Lucian ran beside me, his silvery blue gaze watching me closely. We spoke to each other in our minds. He never left my side. At some point, exhaustion overtook me. We made it home, and I fell hard asleep.</p><p>When next I woke, I was in my human form, tucked closely against Lucian\u2019s body. The sun had not yet risen, and I felt invigorated. I wanted to explore the shore, so I slipped from our bed, quickly dressed, and headed outside. No one else stirred. I was the only one awake.</p><p>The brisk Highland air greeted me, along with a healthy dose of mist. I found it strange not to be cold, but my core stayed over one hundred degrees, so there was no need for a jacket. I breathed in the air, sweet with clover and something else I couldn\u2019t name, and took in my surroundings. On the left side of the gravel lane, a meadow, and at its edge, a dense copse of wood filled with towering pines and oaks.</p><p>Then I saw it. Through the slender ribbons of mist I saw something white move into view. I stared, my newly sharpened vision trained on the spot. Before my brain registered what my eyes saw, I knew. Pax. He waited for me. Without thought, I took off toward him at a jog, and by the time I reached the wood line, I was at a full run. Pax had disappeared.</p><p>I eased through the trees, the canopy above keeping out any light that may have filtered in, and searched for Pax. Deeper into the wood I moved, determined to settle things with my old partner. Surely, no matter his fate or mine, we could come to terms. We\u2019d been partners. We\u2019d sort of been friends. He\u2019d watched out for me. I knew, despite the awful dreams, he wouldn\u2019t hurt me.</p><p>In the next instant something heavy slammed into my body, and I was knocked hard against the base of an aged oak. I was turned abruptly, and when I looked, the man who pinned me against the tree was not Pax. I frowned, shoved, and cursed. \u201cGet the hell off of me,\u201d I growled and shoved my knee into his balls. \u201cNow!\u201d</p><p>He sucked in a breath but quickly recovered. \u201cOh, no, love,\u201d he said, his accent thick, his tone full of hatred. He pushed me hard against the tree. \u201cWe\u2019ve been waiting for the chance to get at Lucian MacLeod and his brothers, and you\u2019re it.\u201d Without warning, he punched me\u2014caught me right in the jaw, and my head snapped back and slammed into the hard wood of the tree.</p><p>I glared at him. \u201cHe\u2019ll kill you,\u201d I said, my pitch lowering.</p><p>The man laughed. \u201cRight. We\u2019ll see about that.\u201d</p><p>Four other men emerged from the wood. One of them was Pax. He ambled up to me, his eyes laced with disgust. He pushed the guy away from me and leaned close to my ear. \u201cYou did this to me, newbie,\u201d he said, just like in my dream. \u201cI can never go home now. I\u2019ll never see my wife again, thanks to you.\u201d His breath brushed my neck. \u201cI\u2019ve half a mind to just rip your throat out now instead of letting these assholes use you to bait your mate.\u201d</p><p>I met Pax\u2019s hard glare. \u201cDo it,\u201d I said. \u201cStop talking about it and do it.\u201d</p><p>A low growl escaped Pax\u2019s throat, and in the next second he shifted into his wolf form. His fangs, dripping with saliva, hovered close to my ear, my throat. In my head, I imagined myself in my wolf form; nothing happened.</p><p>In the next second, in a flurry of fur and fangs, a pack of nearly black wolves entered the wood at full speed. The men with Pax shifted, and the fight began. I was knocked into a tree, where I fell, crouched to the ground, and watched.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t make myself change. I was helpless.</p><p>The melee was horrific. Bones crunched. Blood. Cries of pain. No human words met my ears, but I heard them in my head.</p><p>Then, a large wolf with a band of white on his chest charged me. It was Pax. I knew it. And I was no match for him. I rose, my back against the tree, and kept my eyes trained on my old partner.</p><p>Just before he lunged, a large black wolf leaped from out of nowhere and slammed Pax to the ground. They fought; fangs gnashed, massive claws raked, bodies smashed into each other. The black wolf was Lucian\u2014about that I had no doubt. With a final agonizing cry, Pax\u2019s neck was broken, and Lucian\u2014God, it was awful\u2014tore into his throat.</p><p>Then it was over.</p><p>Lucian moved toward me, shifted, and stood naked before me. He was covered in Pax\u2019s blood. Anger radiated off him. Anger and relief. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d he said, and grasped my hand, threading his fingers through mine. \u201cThis is over,\u201d he said, and squeezed my hand. \u201cFor now.\u201d</p><p>Together, we walked back to the hall, and Lucian bathed and got dressed. Lucian\u2019s brothers cleaned up the aftermath, and Lucian explained to me what was to come. I can\u2019t say that I was shocked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m verra sorry about your partner,\u201d he said, folding me into his embrace. He rubbed my back, a rhythmic motion that calmed me instantly. \u201cHe was no longer himself\u2014you understand that?\u201d</p> <p>I nodded against his chest. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He looked at me for a moment, searching my eyes. \u201cThere are others. From all over the world, no\u2019 just Scotia. As you worked for WUP, your talents will be trifold as a MacLeod warrior. We go where we\u2019re needed. We fight to protect innocents. And you are one of us now, Gin. Your skills will grow and you\u2019ll become as fast, as strong as I.\u201d He kissed me then, long, erotic, slow. When he pulled back, his gaze all but worshipped me. \u201cBut you\u2019re not there yet, and I\u2019ll no\u2019 take any more chances with your life. You\u2019re mine,\u201d he whispered against my mouth, then brushed his lips across mine. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll no\u2019 leave your side until you have full control over all of your new powers.\u201d He rested his forehead against mine. \u201cI canna lose you, Gin. You\u2019re mine forever.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly I\u2019m Riley again, and I fall back as Scotland and wolves and blood and bone-crunching fade away, and the interior of Castle Arcos emerges once again. I stumble, shake my head, and press my fingers into my eye sockets to try and stop the vertigo from sending me sprawling. \u201cDamn it,\u201d I mutter, and then feel two strong hands steady me.</p><p>Surprisingly, they aren\u2019t Eli\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cPlease, lass,\u201d a deep, heavily accented voice says quietly in my ear. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p> <p>I turn and meet the intense gaze of Lucian MacLeod.</p><p>A fast flash of his body morphing painfully into a wolf scrapes behind my eyes. I see it. I feel it. It\u2019s like...I\u2019m him. For only a brief second. Then he steadies me and turns me loose.</p><p>Lucian is a werewolf.</p><p>And so is Ginger.</p><p>The sincerity in Lucian\u2019s gaze nails me. Paralyzes me. His words sink deep into my psyche, and never have I known myself to fall so hard for a plea as I was falling right this very minute.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll think about it,\u201d I say to Lucian.</p> <p>His gaze lingers, and I can only conclude that he\u2019s trying to see if I mean what I say. Finally, he gives a slight nod and moves away.</p><p>\u201cBut,\u201d I say, looking directly at Jake Andorra, \u201cI want to know more about...your organization. As in, everything. As in, what would be expected of me.\u201d</p><p>He smiles. \u201cI shall tell you everything, indeed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, there you are,\u201d a voice calls out. Smooth. Flawless. Powerful.</p><p>Immediately, I know it\u2019s him.</p><p>He moves so fast, I don\u2019t see him until he\u2019s standing right beside me. Eli protectively pushes between us.</p><p>\u201cBack down, boy,\u201d Julian Arcos says. Gilles and Victorian have entered with him, and both stand a ways back. \u201cI will hold counsel with Riley Poe. Alone.\u201d His voice is cold, his gaze icy as he inspects me from head to toe. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNon,\u201d Eli says, his fingers lacing through mine. His voice is harsh, determined, deadly. \u201cNot without me.\u201d</p> <p>Julian Arcos passes a long, cold gaze over first me, then Eli. \u201cAlone.\u201d</p><p>Not only does Eli stiffen, but Noah, Jake, Gabriel and Lucian all take a step closer.</p><p>The male adrenaline in the room pulses.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Eli,\u201d I say, and move forward. I throw a glance behind me. \u201cGuys, it\u2019s all right. I\u2019ll go.\u201d He\u2019s not going to do anything to me, Eli. With you, Gilles, and the others here? No way. So chill out. I got this.</p><p>Eli\u2019s glare slides over me, and I know he\u2019s on fire. Not only does he hate losing control to Julian, but his protectiveness over me has all but consumed him. I can tell. So I put a hand on his forearm, squeeze, and move in front of him.</p><p>Julian\u2019s long silvery hair gleams beneath the lamplight as a chilling smile touches his mouth. \u201cCome,\u201d he says to me, and grasps my hand, tucks it into the crook of his arm, and without another word, leads me from the others.</p><p>I\u2019d be lying if I said I wasn\u2019t a little intimidated. He\u2019s an ancient, powerful strigoi vampire with more control than even I can fathom. He\u2019s evaded a vampire\u2019s death for centuries. He\u2019s badass and knows it.</p><p>I know it.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Tis true, my dear,\u201d Julian says quietly, bending his head slightly toward mine.</p><p>I don\u2019t even look back as we leave the great hall.</p><p>Julian guides me through the manse, down long corridors and up stairs. By the time we enter the room, I know I\u2019ve lost my way. No doubt he\u2019s done it on purpose.</p><p>The moment we enter the room, Julian moves away. Here one second, gone the next, and I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019s doing it to freak me out. He continues to shift as he speaks. Shit head.</p><p>\u201cRiley Poe. I\u2019ve heard much about you over the years,\u201d he says, appearing next to the wall of books across the room. He slides one out, examines it with long, elegant fingers as though completely uninterested in my presence. \u201c\u2019Tis all Victorian has talked about since his return home.\u201d He slips me a glance and a smile. \u201cRiley, Riley, Riley.\u201d He sighs and replaces the book and looks at me. \u201cI can now see why my son is so obsessed with you.\u201d</p><p>I blink, and he\u2019s gone. Turning my head, I search the massive room for his silver head of hair. He\u2019s nowhere.</p><p>Then he\u2019s everywhere.</p><p>\u201cThe power you have over him intrigues me,\u201d Julian says in my ear. I snap my head to look at him and he\u2019s gone again.</p><p>\u201cHow he\u2019s controlled himself around you intrigues me just as much,\u201d he continues. A long finger traces the black inked wing at my cheek. \u201cWhat is it about you, Riley Poe, that completely drains my youngest son of all decent vampire capabilities? Do you know the power he exerted in order to keep from killing you once he\u2019d tasted your blood?\u201d His lips brush my cheek. \u201cMyself as well?\u201d</p><p>I try to move but nothing happens. I\u2019m paralyzed, frozen in place. Only my mind races. I try to speak\u2014even that doesn\u2019t work. Senior Arcos has me under his power, and it\u2019s damn strong. My eyes, though, work perfectly, and I keep them trained on Julian as he moves in front of me. I decide to speak to him in my mind. So you brought me in here, deep into the belly of your moldy old castle, far away from the others, just to suck the life out of me? Where I come from, that type of person is called a pussy, Jules. I\u2019m just saying.</p><p>Julian stares at me, then laughs. \u201cOf course not, dear. I merely wanted you to understand my position.\u201d He inclines his head. \u201cAnd to make you an offer.\u201d</p><p>I stare at him, waiting.</p><p>He smiles. \u201cIf ever you tire of living the life you lead, Riley Poe, Castell Arcos could surely use a queen.\u201d</p><p>What the hell? Julian Arcos is coming on to me? I continue to stare. Dumbfounded. Is it my strength? My powers? Our blood bond? Whatever it is, uh...no way.</p><p>Julian shrugs as he hears my thoughts. \u201cFor Victorian, one day.\u201d He strokes my cheek. \u201cOr for me. And the answer is yes to all of your own questions. We\u2019d be...invincible together.\u201d</p><p>Thanks for the offer, Jules, but I\u2019ve got a life already and I\u2019ll keep it, if it\u2019s all the same to you.</p><p>Julian\u2019s icy gaze moves over me, slowly. \u201cAs I said. If ever you tire of the life you lead.\u201d His gaze lingers on my mouth. \u201cAnd I fear, my dear girl, with all of the powers inside of you, one day, you will.\u201d</p><p>Our gazes clash and lock.</p><p>\u201cIn the meantime, make sure my eldest is returned to me, unharmed,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd one more thing. Valerian will not be an easy foe to capture. Mention his mother and you may have a slight advantage, even if momentarily.\u201d</p><p>I blink, and Julian Arcos disappears.</p><p>My body relaxes, and I\u2019m in control once more.</p><p>And Julian Arcos has just given me a tip on how to catch his son.</p><p>Easing from the library, I slip out into the ominous hallways of Castell Arcos.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mind Father,\u201d Victorian says from an adjacent alcove. \u201cHe likes you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I got that,\u201d I say, and look at him in the low light of the sconces. \u201cYou\u2019ve been out here the whole time?\u201d</p><p>Victorian shrugs. \u201cOf course. I wasn\u2019t about to let Julian Arcos take you into the bowels of the castle alone.\u201d He grins. \u201cNot that he would\u2019ve harmed you. But he may have frightened you.\u201d</p><p>For a long moment, I stare at Victorian Arcos. Not in a million years, especially after that first night in Bonaventure, when the Arcos brothers both took my blood, would I have ever dreamed he was anything other than a filthy bloodsucker. He seems kind, loyal, and loving. So very different from his brother. So very different from your typical vampire, actually.</p><p>\u201cI am different,\u201d he says, his smile wistful. \u201cYet it\u2019s not enough.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m guessing that, since my latest DNA donors, my mind is an open target for most, if not all, vampires. I\u2019ll have to investigate that. Possibly see what I can do to change it, as it annoys the hell out of me.</p><p>\u201cEnough for what?\u201d I ask.</p><p>He takes a step closer. \u201cTo win your love.\u201d</p><p>The play of light in the brown depths of his eyes as he watches me almost paralyzes me. \u201cI feel something for you, Vic. I just don\u2019t know what that something is. It baffles me, but there is a connection there. But of one thing, I\u2019m absolutely positive,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019m in love with Eli. My loyalty lies with him alone.\u201d</p><p>A slow, wistful smile lifts the corner of his perfectly shaped mouth. He lifts a hand, pushes a stray strand of hair from my face. \u201cYour bald honesty is only one of the things that fascinate me about you, Riley Poe,\u201d he says, his elegant fingers lingering on my jaw. He leans in, his eyes searching mine. \u201cAllow me just this one private good-bye,\u201d he requests. \u201cI\u2019ve waited...forever.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>With his other hand, Victorian cups my face, lowers his mouth to mine, and gently presses his lips against mine. The kiss doesn\u2019t last long, but I feel every ounce of Victorian\u2019s emotion in the kiss. He breaks it, momentarily rests his forehead against mine, then presses his lips to my temple. \u201cTe iubesc,\u201d he whispers. \u201cMersi.\u201d</p><p>I love you. And, thank you.</p><p>Victorian pulls back, looks at me, then blushes furiously. Damn, his cheeks literally turn fire pink. \u201cI forgot you can now understand Romanian,\u201d he says quietly, the r rolling with his accent. \u201cForgive me.\u201d He meets my gaze. \u201cBut I cannot help it.\u201d</p> <p>I shake my head and study him. Such an anomaly. What I once thought was a monster proves to be a sweet, romantic, blushing, young, and beautiful man. Who just so happens to have to live off human blood. I link my arm through his and tug him toward the end of the hall. \u201cI think in another place, another time, Vic\u201d\u2014I look at him\u2014\u201cwho knows? But for now, I love you...as a friend. And one I feel a strong connection to.\u201d</p><p>He smiles at me, and I\u2019m positive it\u2019s a smile that has brought many a young maid straight to her knees. \u201cAnd I accept that, Riley Poe,\u201d he says. \u201cAs long as you realize\u201d\u2014he looks down at me\u2014\u201cthat I will wait for you. For however long it takes.\u201d His eyes glow. \u201cForever.\u201d</p><p>I smile back. \u201cI\u2019d expect nothing less from you, Mr. Arcos.\u201d We hit the steps and make our way back to the great hall. \u201cYou\u2019re coming back with us, right?\u201d I ask.</p><p>Victorian nods. \u201cMuch to your lover\u2019s disdain, yes. I have to ensure my brother\u2019s safety.\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cGood. We can use your help.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGo to your man,\u201d Victorian whispers, and hangs back. \u201cThe lucky bastard awaits you with the others. I think they are arranging a formal meeting for you.\u201d</p><p>With a final smile at Vic, I walk ahead and join Eli and the others. Gilles has joined the group. All heads turn my way as I approach.</p><p>Eli, pacing, stops and walks directly to me. He grasps my shoulders. \u201cWell?\u201d he asks. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>Giving him an assuring smile, I lean up and kiss him. \u201cOui, Monsieur Dupr\u00e9.\u201d I blink. The French rolls off my tongue as though it\u2019s my first language. Intrigued, I decide to give it another try. \u201cEst-ce-que vous avez \u00e9t\u00e9 examiner pour la rage r\u00e9cemment?\u201d I wait expectantly for praise.</p><p>A moment of silence hangs in the air before laughter breaks out in the Arcos great hall.</p><p>Eli\u2019s lips purse tightly together, and he covers his mouth with his hand before shaking his head.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019d I say?\u201d I ask. I look at Gilles. He\u2019s still chuckling.</p><p>\u201cDamn, girl,\u201d Noah says, wiping his eyes. \u201cYou just asked Eli if he\u2019d been checked for rabies recently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOops,\u201d I say. \u201cGuess I need to work on that, huh?\u201d</p><p>Eli pulls me into a hug. \u201cNon,\u201d he whispers against my ear. \u201cI like you just the way you are.\u201d</p><p>I fall easily into his embrace. How simple it is for me to take comfort there. Much easier now that I\u2019ve admitted to myself, and to Eli, how much I truly love him.</p><p>From the corner of my eye, I notice Victorian hanging back somewhat from the group. And for a moment, my heart aches.</p><p>He smiles at me. No, love. Do not ache for me. As I said, I will wait for you. And I shall also enter your thoughts routinely. You\u2019ll grow weary of hearing me, no doubt.</p><p>I do nothing more than smile back at him.</p> <p>\u201cWe must prepare for departure,\u201d Gilles announces, drawing everyone\u2019s attention. \u201cLuc has called several times. The situation is growing, and it\u2019s no longer safe to leave the entire city and our loved ones solely in the hands of my children and wife.\u201d He faces Eli. \u201cValerian has been in hiding, commanding his newlings. They\u2019ve converged now. A large clan descends upon Savannah. We must leave at once.\u201d</p><p>Jake Andorra moves to Eli. \u201cMy team and I will accompany you.\u201d</p><p>Eli nods and grasps his shoulder. \u201cMerci. We can use all the help we can get. Merci.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will help as well,\u201d Victorian adds, standing tall, erect, and meeting Eli\u2019s hard gaze without flinching. \u201c\u2019Tis my duty to bring my brother home.\u201d</p><p>Eli looks first at me, then back to Victorian. \u201cOnly because Riley trusts you so much will I allow this.\u201d</p><p>Victorian simply nods and leaves the hall.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Noah says, clapping his hands together and rubbing them vigorously. His smile is lethal, predatory. \u201cTime to make like a tree and get the fuck out of here.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. Noah\u2019s mercury gaze lights on me and I can\u2019t help but grin at him. Sick fool.</p><p>Within an hour, we\u2019d packed up and, thanks to Julian Arcos, boarded two helicopters bound for Bucharest. Apparently I\u2019d been so out of it on the journey that I\u2019d missed the flight to Castell Arcos. But even I have to admit that the sight of the massive, ancient castle rising out of the misty rocks of the Carpathians is one I\u2019ll not soon forget. Turrets and towers\u2014foreboding, all of it. Yet...enticing. I guess that\u2019s the whole vampire lure. To me, though, it is sheer beauty.</p><p>At the airport, we board the Arcoses\u2019 private jet\u2014a Gulfstream, no less, manufactured directly in my hometown of sultry Savannah, Georgia. The jet is immaculately decorated and lavishly furnished; I admit that it is pretty kick-ass to roll in so much luxury. Not sure I\u2019d ever buy one myself, but it damn sure beats sitting all cramped in coach, with someone kicking the back of your seat or, worse, falling asleep on you. Had that happen to me once. Some weird dude who looked like Satan, complete with pointed goatee and all, fell right over on me. Tried to snuggle. No, thank you.</p><p>As we take off from Bucharest, the sun is setting, and the sky we fly into is various shades of orange, red, yellow, and purple. The Carpathians rise in the distance, and for a solid second, I feel sad that I\u2019m leaving. It\u2019s weird\u2014I\u2019ve never had the first little desire to go to Romania, yet I have some sort of connection to it. I now have the urge to return. Someday.</p><p>It\u2019s not weird, love. The connection to my home is inside of you now, just as my blood, my brother\u2019s, and my father\u2019s circulate with each pump of your heart. It\u2019s natural to feel this. Mayhap one day you\u2019ll come back?</p><p>My eyes shoot over to Victorian\u2019s, and he\u2019s of course watching me. I smile and shrug, then turn back to the window and watch Bucharest fade away. Maybe I will. One day.</p><p>I settle down next to Eli and take notice of my traveling companions. Five vampires, two werewolves, two ancient Pict Druthan warriors, and one mortal-turned-very-important-immortal. And me.</p><p>I have to wonder what exactly the pilot is.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Jake Andorra says, addressing everyone. \u201cSince we had to hurry and leave in such haste I suggest we take this time to acquaint Ms. Poe with WUP\u201d\u2014he slides me a glance\u2014\u201cand what would be expected of her.\u201d His gaze lights on everyone. \u201cAgreed?\u201d</p><p>The plane fills with various forms of agreement: ayes and yeses and ouis.</p><p>Jake nods. \u201cGood.\u201d He\u2019s sitting in the seat across from me, so he leans forward, clasps his hands together, and meets my gaze. \u201cAs you can see, my WUP team is made up of...rather unique beings.\u201d He nods to the various occupants of the plane. \u201cWerewolves. Vampires. Immortals.\u201d He smiles. \u201cAnd you, Riley Poe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat am I?\u201d I ask.</p><p>Jake shrugs. \u201cThat, I haven\u2019t figured out yet, but trust me when I say, you\u2019ll fit right in with the rest of the team. You see, we take on cases too dangerous and powerful for mere mortals to handle. This case is probably our most dangerous thus far.\u201d</p><p>I keep my gaze trained on Jake.</p><p>\u201cYou see, there\u2019s really only one thing more lethal than a vampire,\u201d he says. \u201cA Black Fallen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that again?\u201d I ask, not sure I got the full scoop earlier.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Tis a fallen angel, engulfed in the blackest of magic. And three of the Fallen have descended upon Edinburgh, Scotland, with a vengeance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I ask.</p><p>Jake glances at another. \u201cGabriel?\u201d</p><p>The big guy, Gabriel, meets my eyes. \u201cThe Black Fallen seek two things: one, a soul. No\u2019 just any old soul. A pure one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the second?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Tis an aged tome\u2014the Seiagh\u2014a dark, ancient book of the most potent spells, stolen from the Fallen\u2019s possession centuries before.\u201d His unusual eyes bore into mine. \u201cThey\u2019ll stop at nothing to get both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, and it\u2019ll take all of our powers combined to stop them,\u201d Jake says.</p><p>\u201cMs. Maspeth,\u201d Gabriel continues, \u201cwas chosen at birth to be the only one capable of reading the ancient script of the Seiagh.\u201d He nods at Sydney. \u201cThe Fallen want her as badly as they want the bloody book.\u201d</p><p>Across several rows, my eyes meet Sydney\u2019s. Neither of us says a word. We don\u2019t have to. I\u2019ve been inside her body, linked to her soul. I\u2019ve seen what happens in Edinburgh with the Fallen. I\u2019ve been witness to the...things the Fallen have created to help seek out a pure soul to steal. They\u2019re vicious, horrible creatures that are hideously gross when killed. What a frickin\u2019 mess. And Sydney has kicked some major monster ass.</p><p>I move my gaze back to Jake. \u201cAnd what about Ginger and Lucien\u2019s deal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s...complicated,\u201d Jake begins. \u201cBut it\u2019s a war brewing between two werewolf clans. Major treaties are being broken, and innocents are getting killed.\u201d</p><p>I glance at Ginger. No lie, innocents are getting killed. I saw that while in her body, too.</p><p>I think for a moment, and raise my gaze to meet Eli\u2019s. We look wordlessly at each other. For several long seconds. Then I glance at Jake.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll consider joining the team, Andorra,\u201d I say. \u201cIf you consider taking my brother on, as well. I\u2019m not leaving him behind, and he\u2019s a damn good fighter.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jake grins and nods. \u201cI know that to be true. Done, Riley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said I\u2019d consider it,\u201d I repeat. \u201cI haven\u2019t signed a contract yet.\u201d</p><p>Jake merely grins again. \u201cAh, but you will. And I\u2019ll be ever so grateful for it. Besides, you owe me a new jet. You all but tore the other one to shreds.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSorry \u2019bout that,\u201d I answer, and Jake continues grinning at me. Prick.</p><p>Ginger, her head against Lucien\u2019s shoulder, looks at me. \u201cYour powers, your energy, they\u2019re fantastic,\u201d she says. \u201cSo many innocents can benefit from them, Riley. Join us, please?\u201d</p><p>My gaze moves to Sydney, who echoes Ginger. \u201cPlease?\u201d</p><p>I simply shake my head and sigh. \u201cI will...heavily consider it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t regret it,\u201d Ginger says.</p> <p>Glancing out the plane\u2019s window, I stare at the weightless, empty air. I\u2019m in an airplane with two werewolves, several vampires, a couple of immortals, and whatever you want to call me.</p><p>How life has certainly changed.</p><p>When I think back on me as a kid, doing such stupid, stupid things like drugs, drinking, and quitting school, and then when I think of my life now? It\u2019s impossible to even fathom. Absently, my fingers move to the black wings inked at the corner of my left eye. Damn, I\u2019ve done some idiotic things in my life. I hate worse than anything that my mom had to suffer through them. She didn\u2019t deserve all that I gave her. And she damn sure didn\u2019t deserve to die the way she did.</p><p>I can\u2019t help but wonder what she\u2019d be like now. What she\u2019d think of Seth and me now. Would any of this even have happened? To be perfectly honest I\u2019m surprised I didn\u2019t die young. All the shit I got into as a preteen? How it must\u2019ve killed her inside, to see her baby become such a...loser. I know that I might not be who I am now had it not been for those poor choices, but it\u2019s hard not to hate myself for putting my mom through it all. My heart still hurts, still longs for her. Sometimes I can even feel her close to me. Sometimes, I swear to God, I can smell her. I get a whiff of someone wearing some perfume that reminds me of her and\u2014whack! Heartbreak all over again. I really miss her. At times, I wish she could see, just for a second, that I didn\u2019t stay a loser.</p><p>Eli\u2019s hand finds mine, and he laces his fingers through mine. He looks at me with those enigmatic eyes, and I immediately feel calm. He smiles, and it almost makes my heart seize.</p><p>I lay my head against Eli\u2019s shoulder. My eyes grow heavy, and I close them. After tucking a pillow under my head, since Eli\u2019s bicep isn\u2019t the softest of things, I drift off to sleep.</p> <p>\u201cRiley, wake up,\u201d Eli\u2019s voice whispers against the shell of my ear. \u201cWe\u2019re home.\u201d</p><p>My eyes flutter open, and the moment my brain registers my whereabouts, I sense newlings. I look at Eli. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to hurry.\u201d</p><p>The urgency in his face makes me know my words ring more than true.</p><p>We race from the airport in three cars, through Industrial Park and up Bay Street. I\u2019d slept so hard on the flight home, I don\u2019t even remember landing twice for fuel. Well, I\u2019m full of energy and ready to fight. I\u2019m sick and tired of our lives being disrupted. It has to end. Now.</p><p>We drive straight to Monterey Square and to the House of Dupr\u00e9. It\u2019s now four p.m. Seth meets me at the door and grabs me into a fierce hug. My feet literally leave the ground.</p><p>\u201cRi!\u201d he says into my hair, hugging me so tight I can\u2019t breathe. His arms are like bands of steel around me. He looks at me, those green eyes revealing every single emotion he possesses. \u201cI was going crazy here, worrying about you,\u201d he says. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, of course, squirt,\u201d I reply, having to almost look up to answer him. I smile at him. \u201cYou\u2019ve grown.\u201d</p><p>Seth blushes. \u201cYeah, a little.\u201d He kisses my cheek. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re home, Ri. This time for good, right?\u201d</p> <p>I drape an arm over his shoulder. \u201cDamn right.\u201d</p><p>We walk in together.</p><p>The crowd behind me files in, and the moment Elise spies Gilles, she hurries to her husband and flings herself into his arms. They embrace for a long time.</p><p>\u201cRiley!\u201d</p><p>In the next second, Nyxinnia Foster throws herself at me, almost impales my eye with a pigtail, and hugs me tightly. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you!\u201d she says. \u201cLuc wanted me to stay here. Things are bad, Riley. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, looks like you brought the whole country back with you,\u201d Luc says, walking up and pulling me against him. \u201cNice of you to come back mostly normal, Ri.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s never been normal,\u201d Phin says, and he, too, pulls me into a hug.</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d I answer. \u201cAnd Nyx must be rubbing off on you guys. All this hugging.\u201d</p><p>Phin says something to Luc in French. She might not be normal, but she\u2019s still hot as hell.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m hot as hell all right,\u201d I say. Then smile.</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d Luc says. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Gilles says, and walks to the center of the room. \u201cWe\u2019ve guests and introductions.\u201d He looks around the room and his gaze lands on me. \u201cThen we\u2019ve business to discuss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Preacher and Estelle?\u201d I ask Phin.</p><p>\u201cOn Da Island,\u201d he answers. \u201cThey\u2019re there with Josie, Zetty, and Riggs.\u201d</p><p>Gilles makes fast introductions, then inclines his head. \u201cPhilippe will show you to your chambers,\u201d he says. \u201cYou may settle in and meet in my study in thirty minutes. There is much to discuss.\u201d</p><p>Eli now stands on one side of me, Seth on the other, and Phin and Luc fill in the spaces. \u201cYou brought back a pair of wolves, bro?\u201d Luc asks. \u201cSick.\u201d He glances around. \u201cArcos is staying here, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I answer. \u201cAnd don\u2019t be an ass, Luc. He\u2019s here to help.\u201d</p><p>Luc glares at me.</p><p>\u201cI want to hear more about what\u2019s happening in Edinburgh,\u201d Phin says. \u201cHow old is Darius, anyway?\u201d</p><p>I shrug as I watch the ancient Pict climb the Dupr\u00e9 staircase behind Gabriel and Sydney. \u201cOld as dirt, I think,\u201d I answer. \u201cPretty cool guys, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd they\u2019re here to help, too,\u201d Eli adds. \u201cSo be nice.\u201d</p><p>Luc shrugs. \u201cCool by me.\u201d He leans toward me. \u201cThat whole vampire versus wolf thing? It\u2019s all Hollywood. No bad blood between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood thing,\u201d I say. \u201cBecause Ginger looks like she can kick your ass.\u201d</p><p>Luc rubs his chin. \u201cYou\u2019re probably right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Eli says. \u201cLet\u2019s get ready. We\u2019ve got to get a plan together. Tonight.\u201d</p><p>Thirty minutes later we all meet in Gilles\u2019s study. Philippe passes me as he brings in a loaded tray of food. One gray eyebrow lifts, as does the corner of his mouth. \u201cMademoiselle,\u201d he says. \u201cSo nice of you to return...as yourself. Mostly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m anything but myself, Phil,\u201d I say. His other eyebrow lifts and he continues on. Damn, no telling what I did before Romania. It must\u2019ve been pretty bad, though.</p><p>Gilles is front and center, and the others line the walls in chairs. \u201cI\u2019ve spoken to Preacher,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd to Garr in Carolina. The newlings are being led. They\u2019re merging. And they\u2019re coming here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLed by Valerian,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cOui,\u201d Gilles answers. \u201cAnd it\u2019s you, Riley, that he wants.\u201d</p><p>I sigh. \u201cFigured as much,\u201d I mumble. \u201cSo what now?\u201d</p><p>Eli\u2019s hand grasps mine.</p><p>\u201cWe lure him out,\u201d Gilles says.</p><p>\u201cYou mean Riley lures him out?\u201d Eli answers. \u201cNo, Papa.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes. \u201cOkay, Eligius,\u201d I say, and turn to him. \u201cSeriously. After all this, after all we\u2019ve been through, after all I\u2019ve endured, you\u2019ve seen what I\u2019m capable of. Now\u2019s not the time to be overprotective.\u201d</p><p>That little speech wins me a frown from Eli.</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t be as easy as you think,\u201d Victorian adds. \u201cMy brother is cunning. He suspects something is up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you told him anything?\u201d Luc says.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Victorian answers, and looks at me. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Gilles nods in satisfaction. \u201cThere is an old woman. Gullah. She\u2019s been...in hiding for many years. Preacher says she\u2019s back and knows something that will help us.\u201d He looks toward me and Eli. \u201cI want you two to go and speak with her.\u201d</p><p>Eli nods. \u201cDone. When?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou others will span the city,\u201d Gilles continues. \u201cNyx, love, you will stay here, with me and Elise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Nyx says.</p><p>\u201cGarr believes the research facility off the coast has been taken over by Valerian and his clan,\u201d Gilles says. \u201cDrummond Research. The Gullah have watched them for years, but to my knowledge, they\u2019ve been one hundred percent scientific in their research.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll check it out,\u201d Eli says. \u201cAfter our visit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBon,\u201d Gilles says. \u201cHer name is Darling. You\u2019ll find her in LaFayette Square after nine p.m., so says Preacher.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want no less than four visiting the research island,\u201d Gilles said. \u201cIf Valerian has taken over, it will not be easy to maneuver.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill do,\u201d Eli says.</p><p>Gilles glances around, then nods. \u201cEat. Rest. And be careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou better hit the platters of food before the wolves do,\u201d Luc whispers in my ear. He grins.</p><p>I shake my head and head for the spread. He may be right about that.</p><p>By eight forty-five p.m., we are all ready to head out. I\u2019ve showered and changed into a pair of green cargos, a black tank, and a black, long-sleeved tee over the tank. Plus my Vans. Every holster I own sits against my body, filled with silver blades. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019m ready.</p><p>We all exit the Dupr\u00e9 House at the same time. We all head in different directions. Wolves. Vamps. Immortals. Humans with Tendencies.</p><p>As I step out into the chilly October air, a new scent invades my senses. It surrounds me, invades me, and I draw it in and taste it on my tongue.</p> <p>It\u2019s a fight. A big fight.</p><p>And it\u2019s close....</p><p>Part Eight</p><p>FERAL</p><p>Damn, it\u2019s almost funny to watch Eli with Riley these days. She has changed, yet...not. It\u2019s almost like she was born to belong to Eli, born to become what she is now. Like it was her destiny or something. She was sick before. Now? It\u2019s hard not to stare when she does...anything. It blows my mind to think there\u2019s anything human left in her, but there is. And that\u2019s why Eli won\u2019t budge from her side. I don\u2019t blame him. If she belonged to me, I\u2019d do the same. And yeah\u2014she hates when we say she belongs to him. Cracks my ass up, though. The one thing I don\u2019t understand about her is her liking for Victorian Arcos. It\u2019s fucking bizarre. I guess she has so much of his DNA inside of her? Who knows. What I do know is, you don\u2019t fuck with Victorian. Not that he can\u2019t handle himself. For such a pretty boy, he is tough as shit. But he has it bad for Riley, and if he doesn\u2019t watch himself Eli will be all over him. Damn, that would be a fight worth taking bets on.</p> <p>\u2014Luc Dupr\u00e9</p><p>Eli can\u2019t help but stare, and to me, it\u2019s pretty funny to watch. I\u2019d never met the woman, and I have to admit even I\u2019ve never encountered such a soul before. From what we can see, Darling is beyond bizarre in all her dark, glorious three-hundred-plus pounds of splendor. She wears colorful beads woven in her hair by the dozens, and...plants? Eli bends his head to my ear as we cross the square. \u201cShe wears nothing but weeds?\u201d</p><p>I elbow him in the ribs. \u201cNo, Dupr\u00e9, not weeds. Palmetto fans. She\u2019s woven them together for a dress. And don\u2019t forget\u2014she\u2019s not just eccentric. She\u2019s paranoid schizophrenic. Don\u2019t antagonize her. And the dress? Come on, you\u2019ve seen that before. You\u2019ve lived here for centuries. And it\u2019s the only thing she ever wears.\u201d I lean in. \u201cThe only thing, might I repeat.\u201d</p><p>Eli shudders. \u201cI thought I\u2019d banished it from my memory.\u201d</p><p>I silently chuckle. Surrounded by no fewer than a dozen filled, handheld plastic bags, Darling claims the bench in LaFayette Square, talking to herself.</p><p>Or, maybe to the Marquis himself.</p> <p>As we approach, I pull Eli back. \u201cLet me go ahead. She might start yelling at you. No need for a scene.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNon.\u201d</p><p>I narrow my eyes. \u201cOui.\u201d</p><p>Eli stares hard. \u201cI\u2019m right behind you.\u201d</p><p>With reluctance, Eli lets me walk ahead. I repeat. Lets me.</p><p>\u201cDarling?\u201d I say, stopping a few steps from the bench.</p><p>Darling jerks her head up, surprised by my appearance. She squints. \u201cWho dat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPreacher\u2019s goddaughter. Riley Poe.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPreacher?\u201d Darling said, laughing. \u201cYou all white, girl. Preacher Man, dat old cod is black as da night. You ain\u2019t his kin. Go on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m his goddaughter, Darling. Preacher and Estelle raised me and my brother after my mom was killed.\u201d My voice lowers. \u201cI slay vampires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHot damn, girl!\u201d she exclaims. \u201cYeah, I remember you.\u201d Black as coal, appearing to be in her mid-fifties, with cataracts clouding both eyes, Darling stares hard at me. Recognition sets in to match her words.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say dat out loud, girl,\u201d Darling says in a hushed whisper. \u201cDamn. People tink you crazy.\u201d She erupts into a cackled laugh.</p><p>Eli stands silent behind me. I\u2019m surprised Darling hasn\u2019t mentioned him yet. She probably doesn\u2019t even see him.</p><p>\u201cDarling, listen. I need your help.\u201d I go down on one knee, closer to the woman, but nonthreatening. I hope, anyway. \u201cHave you seen or heard anything about the bloodsuckers lately? Or about me?\u201d</p><p>Grabbing one of the bags next to her, Darling begins rifling through it, searching for...something. Then, she stops and turns her head, away from me, as though someone sits down beside her. \u201cWhat dat? No. I don\u2019t like dat. No!\u201d</p><p>I sit still. Eli doesn\u2019t move a muscle.</p><p>Darling scrunches her features, looks in the direction of whomever she was speaking to in her mind. Finally, she sighs. \u201cFine. I do it.\u201d She waves to me. \u201cTell dat big boy behind you to come here.\u201d</p><p>I turn, meet Eli\u2019s gaze, and incline my head. He eases up beside Darling.</p><p>Darling peers up at him through white, foggy eyes. \u201cWhat you doin\u2019 here, boy? You one of dem, ain\u2019t ya?\u201d She shakes her head, beads clacking together. \u201cOne of dem bloodsuckers. But you different, dat\u2019s right.\u201d She waves her hand at him. \u201cDon\u2019t matta. You here to watch over Preacher\u2019s baby girl, don\u2019t forget dat.\u201d She reaches into her bag and tosses something at me. I catch it. It\u2019s cool and flat, like a piece of metal.</p><p>The Gullah woman lowers her voice. \u201cGirl, dere\u2019s an evil place \u2019round here. People get took dere, but dey don\u2019t want to go. You don\u2019t want to go, either. It\u2019s out in da water, and it\u2019s a bad place.\u201d She leans over, close. \u201cDere\u2019s monsters dere. And bloodsuckers. Some dead. Some not dead. Some wish dey was dead.\u201d</p><p>My insides chill at her words.</p><p>\u201cDarling, how\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShush! Watch your mouth, girl. I ain\u2019t done.\u201d She cocks her head at Eli. \u201cYou listenin\u2019 too, boy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOui.\u201d</p><p>Darling bursts into laughter. \u201cOui? What da hell does dat mean? You crazy, boy?\u201d</p><p>She turns her head again, to the unknown soul whom she speaks to. \u201cOh,\u201d she says to the air beside her. \u201cDat means yeah. Okay den.\u201d</p><p>I share a puzzled look with Eli, then I shrug and turn my attention back to Darling.</p><p>The old Gullah continues. \u201cDey all hidin\u2019 from you. Been hidin\u2019 from you for a while now. Maybe \u2018cause dey busy workin\u2019 in da graveyard? Don\u2019t know why. But soon dey gonna stop hidin\u2019 and git you. You don\u2019t wanna go wit dem. Dat one who was locked away in da ground for all dem years wit his brodder? He\u2019s out. And he\u2019s bad. The brodder ain\u2019t so bad for a bloodsucker.\u201d She points at Eli. \u201cYou watch dis hardheaded ting doh. Make sure dey don\u2019t git her. Dat\u2019s Preacher\u2019s baby girl. She got dat special blood da vampires want. She sees dem. But dey see her, too.\u201d She peers at Eli. \u201cYou don\u2019t want her blood, do you boy? Preacher Man, he kill you good if you bother his baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, ma\u2019am,\u201d Eli answers. \u201cI\u2019d never hurt her.\u201d</p><p>Darling grunts her approval.</p><p>I rise. \u201cDarling, if they\u2014\u201d</p><p>At that point, Darling has obviously experienced enough of me and Eli for the night. She tips her head back, beads jingling, opens her mouth, and yells as if being murdered. A high-pitched, bloodcurdling, banshee-type holler that makes my hair stand up.</p><p>I grab Eli by the hand. \u201cCome on. She\u2019s through with us now.\u201d</p><p>Eli glances over his shoulder as we race from the square. As soon as we step onto the cobbles, Darling ceases her squalling.</p><p>I stare in her direction. Even from that distance, I see the whites of her teeth against her pitch-black skin as she smiles. \u201cBye-bye, Riley Poe!\u201d she yells. \u201cWatch your neck!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s scary,\u201d Eli says.</p><p>\u201cYou ain\u2019t kidding,\u201d I answer, and stop under the next streetlamp. I open my palm and stare down at the object Darling gave me.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Eli asks.</p><p>I pull it closer. \u201cIt\u2019s a flattened tourist penny,\u201d I answer. \u201cWith Bonaventure Cemetery on the front.\u201d</p><p>Eli looks at me. The shadows play across his face, and my heart leaps. \u201cLooks like we\u2019re headed back to the graveyard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s call the others,\u201d I say. \u201cAnd get the Jeep.\u201d</p><p>No sooner have we reached Inksomnia to get the Jeep do I hear glass shatter from next door. A series of Dagala expletives fall onto the night, and in the next instant the door to SoHo Boutique\u2014Bhing\u2019s store\u2014flies open. Bhing\u2019s husband, Ronnie, carrying their toddler and followed by their older boy, comes running out into the alley. Inside SoHo, glass is breaking. It sounds like a tornado is going through the place. Ronnie runs straight toward me, speaking in high-gear Dagala.</p><p>\u201cWhoa!\u201d I say, holding up my hand. \u201cEnglish, Ronnie!\u201d</p><p>As of yet I haven\u2019t been bitten by a Dagala vampire, thus I cannot speak Dagala (except the few dirty words Bhing taught me). I stress the word \u201cyet.\u201d By now, anything\u2019s possible, and I know it.</p><p>\u201cBhing! Something is wrong with her!\u201d Ronnie says, breathless. He points to his eyes. \u201cShe\u2019s no longer seeing me. She came after us, growling and trying to bite!\u201d He looks over his shoulder. \u201cShe\u2019s tearing up the shop!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMommy\u2019s bad,\u201d the little toddler in Ronnie\u2019s arms says, pointing.</p><p>\u201cHelp us!\u201d Ronnie cries. \u201cI\u2019ve locked her in the bathroom. Downstairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay, it\u2019s going to be fine,\u201d I say, and I pray it will be.</p><p>\u201cTake them inside,\u201d Eli says. \u201cI\u2019ll get Bhing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t really know you,\u201d I say, trying to convince him that I need to get her.</p><p>\u201cTrust me,\u201d Eli says. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t know anyone right now.\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cTrue.\u201d Grasping Ronnie by the elbow, I give his older son a comforting smile and incline my head. \u201cCome on. Eli here will take care of Bhing.\u201d</p><p>Ronnie stops and looks up at Eli. \u201cDon\u2019t hurt her. Please.\u201d</p><p>Eli nods. \u201cI won\u2019t. I promise.\u201d</p><p>With that, Eli turns and heads toward SoHo. I hurry Ronnie and his sons into Inksomnia. Inside, I turn. \u201cGo sit in there,\u201d I say, pointing upstairs to my living quarters. \u201cShut the door and don\u2019t open it until you hear it\u2019s me. I\u2019m going to help Eli.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ronnie nods and heads upstairs with the kids. The little one in his arms turns around and looks at me. His shiny black hair swings with the movement of his head.

Bhing lifts her head and stares at me. Her glasses are gone and her eyes are milky white. She snaps at me like a freaking zombie, yet her perfectly-cut black bob swings just as easily as her toddler\u2019s. A frightening sight to be sure. \u201cEesh,\u201d I say. \u201cDefinitely get her there. Fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to tell Ronnie?\u201d Eli asks, heading to the Jeep.</p> <p>\u201cI have no idea. I\u2019ll think of something,\u201d I say. \u201cHurry.\u201d</p><p>I help Eli bind Bhing\u2019s arms and legs, then strap her into the Jeep. He takes off, and I walk inside to hopefully convince Ronnie and the kids that their adorable little Bhing isn\u2019t a monster after all.</p><p>After some hasty explanations, and a promise to help his wife, Ronnie and the kids head back to SoHo to start cleaning up the mess. I tell him the same thing we told Nyx when Seth was experiencing a quickening: drugs. I hated doing it, but it was better than the truth: vampires.</p><p>An hour later, Eli returns, and we continue on to bigger problems.</p><p>Scaling the fence at Bonaventure seems much easier now. One leap and I\u2019m over. No more showing my ass to wind, or clinging for dear life to the metal. Up and over. Gotta love the tendencies.</p><p>I shine my flashlight to a discarded pile of items half buried in the dirt. A finger of dread inches across my spine. \u201cThis is not good.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA hairbrush, plate, coffee mug, a toothbrush. A remote control. A plastic container with\u2014a box of cigarettes and lighter?\u201d Eli says, noting the items. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d</p><p>I draw a breath and stand. \u201cWow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA Gullah grave,\u201d Eli says. \u201cStrange. It\u2019s an old tradition, one that\u2019s not practiced much anymore. Especially here on the mainland.\u201d</p><p>I reach for the remote.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Eli says. \u201cDon\u2019t touch it.\u201d</p><p>I think a moment, then remember Preacher\u2019s teachings. \u201cThe Gullah believe that in order to guarantee the safety of the living, they must placate the dead.\u201d I point to the items. \u201cThey leave the deceased person\u2019s favorite personal belongings behind, to keep them from returning and bothering the living.\u201d</p><p>Eli pulls me away. \u201cTo touch any of it would be...bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d I agree.</p> <p>Eli peers over the edge of the grave. \u201cLooks like they didn\u2019t make it all the way down.\u201d</p><p>I look. They hadn\u2019t even reached the coffin. \u201cGood thing, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo doubt,\u201d he answers.</p><p>I glance around. \u201cI\u2019m not sure why Darling sent us here, but I got a bad feeling, Dupr\u00e9. Let\u2019s go. Bad juju being this close to a desecrated Gullah grave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are Luc and the others?\u201d Eli asks, looking behind him. \u201cI thought they were heading over here?\u201d</p><p>I glance around. \u201cI don\u2019t know but I don\u2019t wanna stick around for them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Eli says.</p><p>I turn off the flashlight and we head back to the Jeep, through the lengthened shadows that distort perception, make everything seem...surreal.</p><p>But the familiar pungent scent of nearby salt marsh remains steady, and it wafts through the darkened Bonaventure and penetrates my sensitive senses. Crickets chirp, a deafening chorus of melodies echoing through the oaks and magnolia trees. Still no cicadas, though. Not even one since this whole mess started.</p><p>As quickly as I noticed it, everything stopped. Dead, deafening silence. Not one strand of moss moved. Not one frog croaked. Quiet.</p><p>Too quiet.</p><p>Eli stares down at me, his eyes glistening in the moonlight.</p><p>A rotting stench, however, masks the brine from the salt marsh.</p><p>\u201cVampires,\u201d I whisper. \u201cNewlings. Damn, they stink.\u201d</p><p>Eli senses it too and moves his body close.</p><p>I slide a look around. Although subtle, the lengthened shadows shorten inch by inch, stretching gray fingers over the milky white headstones and twisting around them. The longer I stare, the more discombobulated things become. I resist rubbing my eyes. It\u2019ll do no good. I steady the irregular breaths that puff out of my lungs and for once, I\u2019m grateful for my sluggish heart rate. Adrenaline, though, pumps rapidly through my veins.</p><p>I blink.</p><p>In that fraction of a second it takes for my lashes to brush my cheek and lift again, newlings drop from the mossy shadows above, landing in a gap-toothed crescent around us. All punks\u2014at least, they at one time were. Now they are punks with powers.</p><p>Eli tenses and moves a muscular arm across my chest, shielding me. \u201cGet behind me, Ri.\u201d</p><p>His voice lowers with a lethal resonance.</p><p>He\u2019s got to be kidding.</p><p>I stay to his left, curve slightly around his backside, but I don\u2019t cower behind him. We just had this discussion. Eligius Dupr\u00e9 has about the hardest freaking head I\u2019ve ever encountered.</p><p>Lifting my ankle, I retrieve a knife and palm the handle. My eyes pan left to right.</p><p>Seven against two. Where the frig are Luc and the others?</p><p>\u201cSteady, woman,\u201d Eli whispers.</p><p>I palm another blade and brace myself.</p><p>Eli\u2019s strong presence comforts me. Pisses me off, too. I press my head against his shoulder. \u201cHere they come\u2014\u201d</p><p>Shrill yells echo throughout Bonaventure. Out of the shadows, moonlight illuminates the newlings moving toward us. Great. Fucking great.</p><p>\u201cReady to die, bitch?\u201d the one closest to me says. \u201cYou won\u2019t be leaving this graveyard alive\u2014\u201d</p><p>My arm shoots out, lightning fast, and a whizzing noise rushes the night as my silver cuts the air. Twice.</p><p>Two newlings, on their knees now, grip their throats, a gurgled, sputtering choke of a scream breaking from their throats. Within seconds, both fall over, face to the dirt. They begin to seize. A rumble runs through the others.</p><p>\u201cFive left,\u201d I say, palming two more blades.</p><p>Then all hell breaks loose.</p><p>More newlings surge from the shadows, and I break away from Eli, blades in hand. \u201cDon\u2019t watch me,\u201d I warn him. \u201cJust fight!\u201d</p><p>The words barely leave my mouth when two newlings run toward me. Three more are already on Eli. Christ, where have they all come from? Legs braced wide apart, I shift my weight and ready myself. This won\u2019t be easy.</p><p>One reaches me first, and with an in-air, roundhouse kick, I land a foot against the newling\u2019s throat, then shove my blade deep into its heart. As it drops to its knees and screams, I land and slam my fist into the other newling\u2019s face, sending it backward and down. The crunch of bone and cartilage mixes with the gurgle of fluid as I shove my blade into its throat. Crouching, I palm two more blades.</p><p>Another newling grabs me from behind. Shit.</p><p>Lifting my foot, I bang it down on the newling\u2019s instep, but it doesn\u2019t turn me loose. Strong fingers squeeze my biceps and push my elbows awkwardly together. I curse and explode. Too late, though.</p><p>The force of another newling barreling into my gut comes unexpectedly, and the air whooshes from my lungs. For a moment, I\u2019m dazed.</p><p>\u201cRiley!\u201d Eli shouts.</p><p>I want to shout back and tell him to just take care of the ones he has, but I can\u2019t speak. What\u2019s wrong with me? Why am I so freaking weak?</p><p>The newling behind me pushes my elbows together, and the pain forces my hands to open, dropping both blades. The newling in front of me smiles, his face contorting into his vampiric form, that convoluted mouth lifting, jaw dropping, exposing several jagged fangs. I shoot a glance at Eli. He has no fewer than five newlings on him. Damn it!</p><p>With a closed fist, the newling in front of me slams into my left eye. My head swings hard right, and stars flitter behind my lids. \u201cThat\u2019s for Charleston, bitch,\u201d the newling says. \u201cBut I\u2019ve more for you.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head, trying to gather myself. \u201cFuck off\u2014\u201d</p><p>Like a flash of light, his arm shoots out and fists my other eye, then my ribs.</p><p>I fall forward, feeling the bone give in my side, but the newling holding me jerks me back up. \u201cNo, no, not done yet, Fight Club.\u201d</p><p>Ah, so that\u2019s it. A couple of disgruntled fighters.</p><p>I gather myself. I feel the energy inside me grow. I\u2019ve got this...</p><p>Then, the one in front disappears as a flying hulk of muscle tackles him to the ground.</p><p>I wheeze, draw in as much air as I can, and lift both knees to my chest. That rib is digging into my lung or something because it\u2019s hard to breathe. I ignore it and push. The shift in my weight throws the newling holding me from behind off balance, and I twist one arm free. I turn, ignore the blinding pain in my ribs and rear back my foot, then sink it deep into the vamp\u2019s groin. Even vampires have sensitive peckers, so it seems. Another chilling, high-pitched scream breaks Bonaventure\u2019s silence.</p><p>I\u2019m finally free and I double over, catching my breath. I scan the ground, find my blades, and lunge for them. With both firmly in each hand, I throw one at the newling holding its crotch. The silver buries to the hilt. The other vamp\u2014a short, stocky punk with a shaved head and a tattoo on his throat, hurls himself straight at me. I roundhouse kick and land him flat on his back. I follow him down, straddling his chest in one move. With my knees, I pin his arms by his side. I press the blade to his thick, muscular neck. Jaw unhinged, fangs dropped, eyes white and pupils pinpoint red, he glares at me. Hisses, even. Hisses!</p><p>Then, Eli is beside me. \u201cRiley, move off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I got it.\u201d I press the blade deeper, and the newling\u2019s eyes bulge. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGet the...fuck...off me!\u201d it says between gasps of air.</p><p>\u201cDid Valerian send you?\u201d I ask, already knowing the answer. Wonder where the coward was anyway?</p><p>\u201cNone of your fu\u2014\u201d</p> <p>I find myself off the newling and on my backside. I shake my head as my equilibrium takes a twirl. I focus on Eli.</p><p>He has the newling by the throat, suspended in the air by one muscled arm. The newling\u2019s legs dangle inches from the ground.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Eli asks, giving it a hard shake.</p><p>I slide a quick glance around. Nine downed and very dead newlings lie motionless on the ground.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen him,\u201d the young vamp grinds out. \u201cI\u2019ve never fucking seen him. Keeps to himself.\u201d</p> <p>I push myself up, holding my side, and walk closer. \u201cA name. A place to find the name.\u201d I press my blade to the newling\u2019s testicles. \u201cOr I swear to God, I\u2019ll cut your balls off before I stick this in your heart.\u201d</p><p>A swear tears from the newling\u2019s misshapen mouth. \u201cOkay, okay,\u201d it says in a voice a bit higher pitched than before. \u201cDrummond. He calls himself Drummond.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are the others like you hiding out?\u201d I press the blade deeper. A trickle of white oozes out, the fading light from the moon glinting off the milky liquid as it trails down one leg.</p><p>\u201cFuck!\u201d he yells, trying to squirm away. \u201cCrazy bitch\u2014get off me!\u201d</p><p>Eli squeezes harder and gives it another shake. \u201cSpeak, or I\u2019ll cut them off myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome experiment,\u201d he chokes out. \u201cGoddamn witch doctor potions. Drummond\u2019s research\u2014has something to do with reversing powers or something. I don\u2019t know!\u201d</p> <p>A blade whizzes through the air and buries into the newling\u2019s heart. With a curse, Eli drops the body as it begins to seize.</p><p>I drop, too.</p><p>Eli moves beside me. I\u2019m holding my ribs. Damn, it hurts just to draw a stinking breath.</p><p>\u201cRiley? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d Eli says. He\u2019s holding me now.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be okay,\u201d I say, although not with much energy. \u201cI think I got a broken rib.\u201d</p><p>My words muffle against Eli\u2019s shoulder as I fall into him. He steadies me, then scoops me up.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d I ask. \u201cWe can\u2019t just leave the bodies here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can and we will,\u201d Eli says. \u201cWe\u2019re in a graveyard, Riley.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh yeah,\u201d I gasp. \u201cHey, I\u2019ll heal quickly, right? Getting kinda hard to breathe here, Dupr\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you\u2019ll heal quickly,\u201d he answers as he crosses Bonaventure. \u201cGotta get you home and wrapped first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds interesting,\u201d I mutter.</p><p>Just before I pass out.</p><p>So much for frickin\u2019 frackin\u2019 superpowers.</p><p>What the hell?</p><p>Part Nine</p><p>REVENGE</p><p>She\u2019s cool. I mean, not just because of what she\u2019s become, and what she can do. Yeah, all that is sick but what I like best is she treats me like I\u2019m an adult instead of a perpetual kid. I might be in the body of a fifteen-year-old but I\u2019m far from that. I\u2019ve lived dozens of full lives. I get sick of looking like a kid. But getting treated like one? Totally lame. But Riley treats me with respect. She\u2019s like a sister to me, and I\u2019m glad she\u2019s part of our family. She can kick some sick ass, too, and she listens to me. Like when I tell her the aim of her throw is all off, she actually listens to my advice and follows it. I think that\u2019s pretty cool. And, I\u2019m totally in love with her brother. Lol!</p><p>\u2014Josie Dupr\u00e9</p><p>\u201cChrist, girl. Be still.\u201d</p><p>I frown, expire a huffy breath, and continue to stare at Eli\u2019s angry face. Tense muscles flex in his jaw as he inspects my injuries. With a thumb and forefinger, he tilts my chin and examines both of my swollen eyes. Then with both hands, palms open, he runs them over my entire head.</p><p>\u201cLift up your arms.\u201d</p><p>I sigh. \u201cJesus, Eli, I\u2019ve looked much worse\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLift up your damn arms, Riley. Now.\u201d</p><p>With a curse, I raise my arms. Eli slides his hands over my ribs, lingering on the left side. I wince when he presses the area.</p><p>\u201cDamn, girl,\u201d Luc says, stepping into my kitchen. \u201cYou look like shit.\u201d</p><p>I shoot daggers at him with my eyes. He laughs.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Noah says, sliding onto the counter beside me. \u201cI think it\u2019s pretty hot looking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think a Dalmatian in heat is hot looking,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cBe still,\u201d Eli commands.</p><p>I close my mouth and glare at Noah. He wags his brow and grins.</p><p>Eli\u2019s face hardens and he gently lowers my arms. \u201cYou\u2019ve cracked two ribs. Don\u2019t move. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d He disappears down the hall, leaving me alone with my annoying audience.</p><p>\u201cSo somehow you were drugged,\u201d Phin says, leaning on the counter close to me. In his palm, a small leather pouch. \u201cThat explains why you\u2019re so banged up. Talked to Garr on the phone. He swears it\u2019s a potion he\u2019s never mixed before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Luc continues. \u201cNormally, none of these injuries would\u2019ve had time to set in. Not with your tendencies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEspecially not with your funky DNA,\u201d Noah adds. He shakes his head, his dreads moving with him. \u201cSick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d Gabriel says, his thick Scottish burr sounding out of place in my small Savannah apartment. \u201cWhy would they drug you, and how?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer powers exceed even that of most newlings,\u201d Phin adds. \u201cShe\u2019s got strength that hasn\u2019t fully developed yet, but it will.\u201d He glances at me. \u201cWhatever sick potion Valerian is concocting, it\u2019s potent. It knocked Riley on her ass. Rendered her almost completely helpless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am far from helpless,\u201d I say. \u201cAnd for the record, getting sick of all of you talking around me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo when did Valerian become a freaking scientist?\u201d Luc asks.</p><p>\u201cHe studied in Spain,\u201d Victorian answers. He has stood in the corner, quiet, until now. \u201cI always knew he was interested in science, but never did I think he\u2019d take such an interest in Gullah potions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s learned to manipulate the compounds,\u201d Phin says. \u201cLethal in the wrong hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, his are definitely the wrong hands,\u201d I say.</p><p>Are you okay? You look awful.</p><p>Yes, Vic, I\u2019m fine. I look worse than I feel. Promise.</p><p>I\u2019m sorry.</p><p>For what?</p><p>Not killing my brother sooner.</p><p>I look at Victorian, and notice the regret in his chocolate eyes. I mouth I\u2019m fine, and smile. Then I glance at the neon-green numbers on the microwave. Four twenty a.m. My stomach growls, a grumbly reminder of how long it\u2019s been since I\u2019ve eaten.</p><p>\u201cDamn, Riley, I can hear that all the way from over here,\u201d Noah says. \u201cYou want something to eat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I answer. \u201cKrystals. Twelve of them. With cheese. Bread extra greasy please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s a Krystal?\u201d Lucian asks.</p><p>\u201cCan I take your Jeep?\u201d Noah asks.</p><p>\u201cPlease, and hurry,\u201d I say. Then I smile. \u201cAnd thanks.\u201d</p><p>Noah grins. \u201cYou owe me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, anyone want to go with?\u201d Noah asks.</p><p>All but Phin head out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry we weren\u2019t there to help,\u201d he says to me. \u201cThat gang of newlings dropped out of nowhere. Took us all by surprise.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cYou should see Darius fight. That...is something not human.\u201d</p><p>I smile. \u201cFunny, coming from an ancient vampire.\u201d</p><p>Phin frowns. \u201cI\u2019m not ancient. But I am sorry. You could\u2019ve been killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I wasn\u2019t,\u201d I assure him. \u201cAnd you had your own fight to contend with. No worries, yeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey Phin,\u201d Luc says, poking his head back through the door. \u201cCan you drive a load? Too many to fit in the Jeep.\u201d</p><p>Phin looks at me. \u201cBe back in a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget to pick up my brother,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cWill do.\u201d Phin leaves.</p><p>Eli returns with the first-aid kit. He sets the white plastic box on the counter, next to where he\u2019d placed me, then rests a hand on each side of my hips. He urges my knees apart with his own hip and draws close, wedging his big body between my legs.</p><p>His gaze settles first on my mouth, then lifts to my eyes, where they linger for several seconds. Heat rushes to my inner thighs. In those blue, aged depths, I see more than just anger, more than just irritation because I wouldn\u2019t be still and let him doctor me. I see regret.</p><p>And something else that doesn\u2019t make sense. Fear? It makes my stomach plunge, as though falling from an airplane. What could Eli Dupr\u00e9 possibly fear? A few deep breaths, which hurt like hell, purge the nagging feelings. No time for crap like that.</p><p>I\u2019m silent as Eli digs through the first-aid kit and pulls out a bottle of antiseptic and a few cotton balls. Saturating the white balls, he angles my head with one hand and dabs at the dual cuts on each cheekbone with the other.</p><p>\u201cOuch-cha,\u201d I say, flinching.</p><p>His eyes flash, then he administers my care in total silence.</p><p>I let him.</p><p>When Eli finishes, he sets the cotton aside and picks up a roll of thick, white cloth wrapping tape.</p><p>\u201cLift your arms.\u201d</p><p>I lift a brow, then my arms.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t even crack a friggin\u2019 smile.</p><p>Grasping my tank top by the hem, he pulls it slowly over my head and drops it on the floor. Although I\u2019m wearing a sports bra, Eli\u2019s eyes dip to my breasts, and they immediately respond, tightening into sensitive peaks beneath the cotton material.</p><p>Eli\u2019s nostrils flare and the muscles in his jaw jump. \u201cHold on to my shoulders, Poe.\u201d</p><p>Lifting my hands, I place them on Eli\u2019s muscular deltoids.</p><p>\u201cHigher.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I lift my elbows a bit. \u201cBetter?\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t say a word, just lifts the edge of the tape from the roll and pulls about six inches loose, then presses it to my side, just under my breast. \u201cThis will hurt a bit.\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cNo prob. I\u2019m used to it.\u201d</p> <p>He looks up then, that mysterious blue gaze unreadable, unsettling. \u201cTake in a shallow breath and hold it.\u201d</p><p>I do, and he begins wrapping.</p><p>From just under my breasts to above my navel, he circles a tight bandage of tape. I won\u2019t lie\u2014it pinches. Hell, it hurts. But I remain silent.</p><p>Finished, he sets the roll aside and inspects his work, running his hands down my sides.</p><p>After a moment, he pushes out a slow breath between his teeth. His eyes meet mine, only inches from my face. \u201cI felt like my insides were being ripped out of my gut, watching you get hurt tonight. Doesn\u2019t matter that you held your own. Do you understand me, Riley?\u201d</p> <p>I shake my head. \u201cEli, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>Lifting his hand, he scrapes the pad of his thumb over my lip and uses the slightest pressure to urge my mouth open. He angles his head and presses into me, taking in a long breath as he kisses me totally senseless.</p><p>My own breath hitches and I drown in the slow, erotic brush of his lips, shoving my fingers through his silky hair and tasting him back. I gasp as my broken ribs pinch.</p><p>Eli\u2019s hands graze my taped sides, gently now, and he stills them against me. Warmth from his hands makes me sink into him, but he makes no further moves\u2014only deep, possessive kissing. I can handle that.</p><p>\u201cDamn. Thought you were hungry. For food.\u201d</p><p>I crack open one eye and stare at Luc, wagging a bag of Krystals. Everyone else has frozen in place behind him. How many people? Seven. Gotta love a close-knit family.</p> <p>Eli kisses the tip of my nose and pulls back. \u201cYou need to eat.\u201d</p><p>The scent of deliciously greasy burgers rises from the bag and wafts my way. Suddenly, I agree. \u201cYou\u2019re right. Hand \u2019em over, Dupr\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>You may not be able to see what I do, but I know you can hear me, Riley Poe. Know this: you\u2019re mine. You were always meant to be mine, no matter how long a time separates us. My brother isn\u2019t the only one who has watched you over the years. You now have me inside of you. Not just my brother. I was always stronger than him anyway. You\u2019ll come to me. And when I\u2019m finished fucking you, no other will ever be able to satisfy you. Do you know what it feels like to be forever unsatisfied? No longer able to experience an orgasm? Trust me, Riley. You will gladly come to me. And you will beg to become mine forever.</p><p>My eyes flip open and I scan the room. I\u2019m in my bed, alone. Daylight streams through the window. I glance at the clock. It\u2019s close to one p.m.</p><p>How in the holy hell is Valerian speaking to me in my head? Now he wants me for a lay? For a wife? Whatever, freak.</p><p>As I move, I notice I\u2019m not nearly as sore as I was the night before. I\u2019m not positive if it\u2019s the bandaging job Eli did on my ribs, or if whatever dope I was slipped has finally worn off. Either way, I feel better. I walk to my bathroom and flip on the light. Peering at my face, I even see a difference there. Not nearly as swollen, and my eyes aren\u2019t as black as I thought they\u2019d be. Cool. Fast healer. Good because I don\u2019t have time for bullshit. Especially don\u2019t have time for psycho vampires obsessed with me.</p><p>Oh, I\u2019m obsessed with you, all right. I\u2019m not psycho, though. You\u2019ll come to me. I can promise you that, my love. Just wait until you get the news. You\u2019ll come. And you\u2019ll know exactly where to find me. If you\u2019re wise, you\u2019ll come alone. Despite how Hollywoodish that sounds, it\u2019s true. Heed my words. And you should be finding out the details about....now.</p><p>Eli throws open the door. His face is, believe it or not, paler than its usual color. I immediately know something\u2019s wrong.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I say, panic rushing through me. \u201cEli, what is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEstelle,\u201d Eli says, barely above a whisper. \u201cShe went missing about an hour ago.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t wait for an explanation. I ask no questions. No need to. I already know what\u2019s happened. I turn too fast and notice my ribs hurt more than I think they do. I ignore the pain though and hurry to my closet.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Eli asks.</p><p>\u201cFinding something to wear,\u201d I say. There. A clean pair of cargos. I first go to the cabinet of blades, secure the leather sheaths, and stuff each one with silver. I ease into my cargos, find a long-sleeved shirt, and attempt to pull it over my head. Not working. Shirt too tight. I throw it in the corner.</p><p>\u201cRiley, stop,\u201d Eli says, and reaches for me.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t!\u201d I jerk around to face him and cringe as my ribs pull at me. Anger forces the pain away. \u201cI know where she is, Eli, and I\u2019m going to get her.\u201d</p><p>His steely grip on my forearm stops me. \u201cLike hell you are.\u201d</p><p>I shake him off and try another shirt, one last time. It\u2019s a little looser and I ease it over my head and slowly pull one arm in at a time. On crooked, but on. I yank on my boots and push past Eli.</p><p>He stops me.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me he wants,\u201d I argue. \u201cI can handle myself. Estelle is almost seventy. She might know how to concoct potions but she can\u2019t handle herself against a strigoi.\u201d I head out into the living room and grab my Jeep keys off the counter.</p><p>By the time I make it to the door, Eli is already there. \u201cYou\u2019re crazy if you think I\u2019m going to let you walk out of here alone, Riley,\u201d he says. \u201cHell no. I\u2019m going with you.\u201d</p><p>For a split second, I think of my dog and glance around. It takes me a second to realize Chaz is at the Dupr\u00e9 House. Good. Because I didn\u2019t want to leave him again.</p><p>Just like I don\u2019t want to leave Eli. Or do what I was about to do.</p><p>There is no choice. Valerian will kill Estelle, and he\u2019ll not only enjoy it, but he\u2019ll flaunt it. And he\u2019ll have no regrets. He fears nothing.</p><p>That\u2019s about to change.</p><p>\u201cRiley,\u201d Eli warns, his eyes locked solid onto mine. He senses something, and his nostrils flare. His body tenses. \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Before the word is out of his mouth, I use the one tendency Julian taught me to use before leaving Romania. I\u2019d not tried it on anyone, save Julian.</p><p>Concentrating, I hold Eli\u2019s gaze. I speak to him in his mind.</p><p>Stay where you are, Eli. Don\u2019t move. Don\u2019t leave here until after I\u2019ve gone. Your body is heavy, and my will is stronger than yours. You know it. You feel it. The synapses in your nervous system aren\u2019t firing. You\u2019re paralyzed. You\u2019ll stay that way until I\u2019m gone. Until ten minutes after I\u2019m gone.</p><p>The moment my words sink in, I can tell. Eli\u2019s eyes glaze over as he stares at me. I know he sees me, knows I\u2019ve used something on him, and that he hears and knows everything around him. He\u2019ll be pissed. I can\u2019t worry about that now. I waste not even a second. I turn and run from my apartment.</p><p>Pelting rain slashes in stinging bullets as I kill the motor of the nineteen-foot skiff I borrowed from Bell\u2019s Landing and let it slide onto the deserted beach of the research facility. One of the smaller barrier islands, it was purchased years ago for the sole purpose of using it for the facility. I can\u2019t imagine what Valerian is using it for. Doesn\u2019t matter. He knew exactly what to use to get me here, and it worked just as well as if he had used mind control on me. Grabbing the rear anchor, I plop it into the water and tie it off. I pull the drain plug and jump out.</p><p>No sooner do my feet hit the sand than six newlings descend from the trees. I sense them before they drop to the ground. Crouching, I whip out two blades and down two newlings before they attack me.</p><p>Surprisingly, I\u2019m not killed.</p><p>Ah, you trust me, Riley. That touches me deeply. It truly does. So to show you my good faith and word, I\u2019ll send your beloved surrogate grandmother back to the mainland with a trusted servant. You\u2019ll remain here. With me. Understood?</p><p>\u201cI want to see her,\u201d I say, and I glance around, searching for Valerian. Instead, a newling emerges from the palm fronds and scrubs, leading a slow-walking Estelle.</p><p>\u201cBaby, why you come here?\u201d Estelle says angrily. \u201cI told dat evil boy you wouldn\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>I struggle against my attackers. I have to stop and think about what\u2019s inside of me, what grows and changes daily. I\u2019m strigoi. I\u2019m Arcos. I\u2019m Dupr\u00e9. I\u2019m Gullah.</p><p>A deep breath, and I summon all of my strength. Although it takes four newlings to hold me, I knock them all in different directions. I take off, send the last newling sprawling, and pull Estelle into a fierce hug. \u201cGrandmodder,\u201d I say, checking her over. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, girl, yes,\u201d she says, and I can hear the relief in her voice. \u201cI\u2019m fine, now, stop all dat.\u201d She looks at me, her ebony face smooth, her eyes searching mine. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have come here, dat\u2019s right. You shouldn\u2019t have.\u201d</p><p>I hug her again, drawing in the familiar scent of Downy and Gullah herbs. \u201cNo way would I let them keep you out here, Grandmodder. No way.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m waiting, Riley. I don\u2019t like to wait.</p><p>A newling appears\u2014young, no more than nineteen, wearing ripped destroyed jeans and a leather jacket. Although not morphed completely, his eyes are white, pupils pinpoint and fire red. He looks to be in a trance as he moves toward the skiff.</p><p>\u201cNo way am I letting my grandmother get into a boat with him,\u201d I say out loud. \u201cHell no, Valerian.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s perfectly capable, Riley. Trust me. I\u2019ve instructed him to take her straight to River Street. He\u2019ll help her up the dock and off to her home she can go. I give you my word.</p><p>\u201cNo, baby,\u201d Estelle says. \u201cCome with me.\u201d</p><p>I kiss my surrogate grandmother on the cheek. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d I smile at her. \u201cBut it\u2019ll be okay. I promise. Now go quietly, please. I\u2019m begging you.\u201d</p><p>Without another word, the newling grasps Estelle by the arm and leads her to the skiff. As though he\u2019d been around boats all his life, the newling pulls the anchor, plugs the drain, and starts the motor. Estelle\u2019s gaze stays on mine until they\u2019re out of sight. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The moment I let down my guard, something plunges into my neck. A pinprick. A needle. A dart. I don\u2019t know. But in seconds, I\u2019m slipping to the ground...</p><p>Part Ten</p><p>REDEMPTION</p> <p>I think Riley\u2019s tendencies have surpassed my own abilities. Doesn\u2019t bother me. I like how strong she is. The control she\u2019s learned in the short time we\u2019ve been back from Romania blows my mind. It takes everything I have not to interfere. Her reflexes are scary fast. And the mind manipulation she exerts? No one is unaffected. Not even me. Especially that bastard Arcos. It\u2019ll be interesting to see if Riley can keep from killing him. For the sake of all of us, I hope she can. A war between the Dupr\u00e9s and Arcoses wouldn\u2019t be pretty. And I\u2019m not willing to risk losing Riley. Without her, my existence is meaningless.</p><p>\u2014Eli Dupr\u00e9</p><p>Something hot and wet trails my cheek and rouses me from a drug-induced slumber. Forcing my eyelids to open, I squint into the near darkness. I try to move, but I\u2019m shackled to a cot. The room is cold. Damp. Smells moldy. I turn my head.</p><p>And stare into a pair of dark eyes. Human. With tendencies.</p><p>\u201cAwake now, are ya?\u201d the man, apparently a guard, whispers in my ear. \u201c\u2018Bout goddamn time.\u201d</p> <p>My first reaction is to bite off his damn ear, then head-butt him into oblivion. He can see me in the moonlight, but I can see only his shadowed shape. With my arms and legs bound, I can\u2019t budge.</p><p>Instead, I slide him a slow, sexy smile. I trace my bottom lip with my tongue. \u201cGod, you smell good,\u201d I lie. \u201cCome closer.\u201d</p><p>The guard pauses, probably stunned from what I\u2019ve said, but then his brain cells rush to the winning muscle and he leans over me, just like I ask. \u201cYeah? You think I smell good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm-hm,\u201d I croon, thanking God above that the man indeed didn\u2019t smell overly stinky. \u201cI bet you taste even better.\u201d</p><p>Again, he pauses\u2014but only briefly. His mouth moves to mine. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you find out?\u201d Moving a hand to my breast, he squeezes it hard and shoves his tongue in my mouth.</p><p>Biting back the urge to barf, I kiss him back, a furious, fast kiss, just to turn him on. It does. He gropes at me then, lifting my shirt and pushing my bra up, ignoring the tape wrapping my ribs, and grasping my bare breast and squeezing. He moans, and starts to climb on top of me. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna like this, baby,\u201d he grunts.</p> <p>Fighting back the urge to kill him now, I move my mouth to his ear. \u201cWait,\u201d I whisper, licking his earlobe. \u201cSlow down.\u201d I bite the shell of his ear to get his attention. \u201cThis would be a lot more fun if I weren\u2019t tied up. Don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>The guard, silhouetted by the light coming down from the ceiling, grunts. \u201cYou might get away. Then my ass is fried.\u201d He bends his head and tries to kiss me, but I move my mouth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just a girl. I can\u2019t possibly get away from you. Besides,\u201d I say, breathing hard, \u201cwhy would I want to? I\u2019m wet and horny as hell.\u201d I move to his ear once more and give a whispered moan. \u201cAnd I want to fuck your brains out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus God, woman,\u201d he says after a second. Fast as he can, he pulls something out of his pocket. \u201cHold still.\u201d</p><p>A pair of cutters clips through the thick plastic tie-wraps binding my wrists and ankles. As soon as I\u2019m free, he throws them to the floor and falls upon me. Again, I give just enough to keep him interested, then push him away.</p><p>\u201cWait a minute,\u201d I say in a fake, excited breath. \u201cNot so fast.\u201d I reach between his legs, grab his arousal, and give an even faker moan of sexual impatience. \u201cLet me get on top.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKinky bitch, ain\u2019t ya?\u201d he says. \u201cWith that weird tat on your face. What other tats you got, babe?\u201d He chuckles. \u201cOkay, whatever you say.\u201d He rises, allowing me to move out from under him, then he takes my spot, on his back. He gropes himself impatiently. \u201cHurry up. I\u2019m about to spurt in my goddamn pants.\u201d</p><p>The moonlight spreads over him now, illuminating some of his features. Crew cut, mid-forties\u2014an average-looking man. A pervert. A pervert with tendencies.</p> <p>Internally repulsed by the disgusting threat of spurting, I sling one leg over his hips and straddle him, wriggling against his rising erection. He grabs my hips, shoving me harder against it.</p><p>\u201cYeah, baby, do me,\u201d he says, his voice thick with excitement. \u201cTake off your shirt so I can see your tits swinging in my face.\u201d Apparently, junior here has watched one too many cheap pornos.</p><p>Grabbing the hem of my shirt, I slowly pull it off and drop it on the floor. His eyes glaze over as they lock on my dragons. \u201cGoddamn, baby, that\u2019s hot as shit.\u201d He lifts a hand and fingers the ink markings on my arm.</p><p>Just to give the situation an added extra, I palm his crotch. \u201cOh, you\u2019re so hard,\u201d I say. \u201cAre you ready for me?\u201d</p><p>He presses my hand hard against him. \u201cOh yeah, bitch, I\u2019m ready all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>He grunts with what I suspect is a sexually excited moan of pleasure.</p><p>Then I rise off him, stand next to the cot, and slowly unbutton my jeans.</p><p>\u201cHurry up, baby,\u201d he says, yanking his zipper down and groping himself. \u201cI\u2019m gonna come all over my\u2013Humph!\u201d</p><p>The wind leaves his lungs in a painful, gurgling gush as I raise my leg and slam the heel of my boot down hard on his crotch. He gasps a few times, ineffective little puffs of wind as he curls into a ball, hands cradling his privates.</p><p>Wasting no time, I rear my foot back again and catch him full force under the chin, sending him sprawling off the cot.</p><p>\u201cBitch!\u201d he wheezes, spitting.</p><p>Another stomp to the groin sends the guard into a spasm of air sucking and cussing.</p><p>Dropping to my knees, I fish in his pocket for the tie-wraps I\u2019d felt while straddling him. Grabbing a handful, I quickly bind his feet.</p><p>The guard reaches for something, and knowing he has tendencies makes me not trust him for a single second, or waste a single move. I dive in the same direction, my fingers brushing the cutters, knocking them across the room where they ping off a wall. \u201cAh-ah, shithead. No getting out of the wraps.\u201d</p><p>I stand and put my boot to his throat. \u201cTurn onto your stomach or you\u2019ll be whistling out of a brand new hole in your neck. Now.\u201d</p><p>He curses, then turns over.</p><p>I drop a knee right between his shoulder blades, wrench one of his arms behind him and pin it with my weight. Quickly, I grab the other arm, then tie-wrap them together. I kneel over him, close to his ear.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to tell me a few things,\u201d I say, barely above a whisper. I concentrate, envisioning in my head that I can make this prick do anything I want him to do with no resistance. \u201cAnd you\u2019re going to do it quietly. Now roll over and be still.\u201d</p><p>He does and goes completely motionless. Says nothing. Doesn\u2019t move. But his eyes stay fixed on mine.</p><p>\u201cGood boy. Now tell me where we are,\u201d I command.</p><p>\u201cThe research center,\u201d he mumbles. \u201cLab.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat research?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cExperiments,\u201d he says. \u201cOn blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhose?\u201d I demand.</p><p>\u201cAll of ours,\u201d he mutters. \u201cYours. Mine. Those like us.\u201d</p><p>The picture became clearer. \u201cVampires.\u201d</p><p>He shrugs.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Valerian Arcos?\u201d I ask.</p><p>The guard remains silent. I give him a mental shove without even realizing how I\u2019ve done it. Apparently, it doesn\u2019t feel too good to have your brain pushed.</p><p>He screams.</p><p>I quickly back off.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen him,\u201d he says, whimpering. \u201cHe only talks to me in my mind. Tells me what to do, whose blood to collect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many others are here?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cNot sure,\u201d he answers. \u201cCould be two dozen, could be one. They come and go.\u201d</p><p>Just that fast, I\u2019m tired of playing the game. I want answers.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the lab?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOut and left.\u201d</p><p>I pull my shirt back on and take off running, pushing through a single door that leads from the room and into a corridor. It has the feel of an old high school built in the fifties, with long halls and rooms on either side. The doors are closed, and only every other overhead light burns. Throwing open door after door, I find nothing. No one. It\u2019s like the facility is abandoned.</p><p>I\u2019m hit from behind.</p><p>Not so abandoned.</p><p>I fly\u2014not literally, but my body leaves the ground and smashes against the wall. I drop, roll, and leap up. My hand feels for a blade down my waistband. I palm it and look.</p><p>Four young vampires. Three males, one female.</p><p>All four leap at me at once.</p><p>With two quick releases, I fling blades and down the two closest to me. I can tell I won\u2019t make it far\u2014they\u2019re quick and almost on me. So I take off.</p><p>I know they\u2019ll have a hard time catching me.</p><p>Down the corridor I run. It\u2019s dim\u2014almost pitch-black. I see a stairwell door and shove through and tear up the steps. In seconds I\u2019m on the third-floor landing and I slam against the metal bar and open the door.</p><p>Six more young vampires are standing there, waiting.</p><p>\u201cYou ain\u2019t goin\u2019 nowhere, Poe,\u201d the one in front\u2014a male with blond spiked hair\u2014says. \u201cHe called you here for a reason.\u201d He takes a step toward me. \u201cYou\u2019re stayin\u2019 a while, darlin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve had enough. Valerian Arcos is a danger I no longer care to have lingering in my life. He\u2019s been able to snatch Estelle right out from under our noses.</p><p>He\u2019s capable of anything.</p><p>He has to be stopped.</p><p>I leap at the leader. His jaws extend and teeth drop. The others follow. I ignore them all. I plunge a silver blade into his chest before my feet bound off his shoulder. As I land behind the group, they turn and descend on me. In one move I crouch, sweep out with one leg and take down the next. The blade I have palmed is buried into the newling\u2019s flesh. She screams and falls with the others. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Three more to go.</p><p>Use your other tendencies, Riley. You don\u2019t have to fight so hard.</p><p>Victorian\u2019s voice echoes inside my head. For a second, it throws me off. Another newling gets close\u2014almost too close. My reflexes are fast and I take it down, land in a crouch. I don\u2019t wait.</p> <p>I kill them all.</p><p>Their screams as their bodies break down chase me down the corridor as I start slamming open doors, searching for Valerian.</p><p>I know you\u2019re here, Arcos! You might as well come out! I yell in my mind to Valerian. A panic grips me\u2014a desperation to find him, to punish him, to send his ass straight to Hell. But each room I find is an empty shell, with peeling walls and broken metal furniture. It reminds me of the tuberculosis sanatoriums they used to have at the turn of the twentieth century until the forties and fifties. An unsettled sensation creeps over me as I slip through the halls. I\u2019m alone, frustrated, frantic. Innocent people have died at this place; I can sense it. Smell it.</p><p>Taste it.</p><p>As I move, I barely notice the speed at which I\u2019m flying through the halls. I hear the eerie echo of my feet through the emptiness, but it\u2019s hard to register that I\u2019m the one making the noises. I\u2019m so goddamn fast, the walls and doors blur past me. My tendencies are many, and apparently they are as close to vampiric as a human can have.</p> <p>In the next second, no fewer than a dozen newlings burst from the stairwell. They surround me, and I know then I\u2019m beaten. No way can I concentrate long and hard enough to manipulate all of their minds; just like I can\u2019t possibly fight them all. They descend upon me.</p><p>I let them.</p><p>One grabs me by my arm and pulls me along. We leave the third floor, down the stairwell, to the second floor. At the end of the corridor, a door stands open. I\u2019m shoved inside, and even though I stumble, I catch myself upright.</p><p>The door slams shut. The room is dark. Not one light is turned on.</p><p>I immediately sense his presence.</p><p>\u201cI need something from you, Riley,\u201d Valerian\u2019s voice speaks from the shadows. \u201cYou have something that even I don\u2019t possess. As a matter of fact, I\u2019m positive there isn\u2019t a soul alive\u2014or not\u2014who possesses it. You are...unique that way. Highly desirable.\u201d</p> <p>I peer into the darkness until a shape, still as stone in the corner, moves. My hand palms the blade sheathed just below the waist of my cargo pants, at the back.</p><p>\u201cAll that silver won\u2019t do you any good with me,\u201d Valerian says.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want with me?\u201d I ask. I still keep my fingers wrapped around the blade.</p><p>Valerian laughs lightly. \u201cAh, it\u2019s so refreshing to experience a human with tendencies who is still so...na\u00efve.\u201d</p><p>His voice is closer to me now, although his shadow hasn\u2019t budged. It\u2019s almost like he\u2019s inside my head, speaking against my eardrum. I inch slowly toward the far wall, the sheath of my knife brushing my fingertips. Confidence races through me. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come out of the shadows and see how na\u00efve I am?\u201d I say. He doesn\u2019t scare me.</p><p>I want to kick his ass.</p><p>Or, kill his ass.</p><p>Again, his low laugh resonates through me.</p> <p>\u201cOh, I will certainly come out of the shadows,\u201d Valerian says. \u201cI\u2019ve been looking forward to this for far too long.\u201d</p><p>The shadows shift, and by the time I blink, and my lashes lift from my face, he\u2019s standing before me.</p><p>He looks strikingly like Victorian.</p><p>Dark, wavy hair brushes the collar of a black silk buttoned-up shirt, tucked loosely into a pair of equally dark pants. Eyes the color of espresso stare at me, weighing, calculating. Full lips and flawless skin make him appear Godlike. He grins.</p><p>I ease my blade from its sheath.</p><p>\u201cTsk, tsk,\u201d he says, and wags a finger at me. \u201cPlay nice. I\u2019m not here to kill you, and we both know how easily I could have done that, had I wanted to.\u201d</p><p>I keep my eyes trained on him. Waiting.</p><p>\u201cMy brother has always had a severe obsession for you,\u201d he continues. \u201cI have always hated him for that. You understand, don\u2019t you? Our kind should remain with...our kind. Uniting with a mortal just isn\u2019t feasible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d I ask. My guard is up, every nerve ending on alert.</p><p>He smiles a long, slow smile and holds out his hands. \u201cYou see,\u201d he begins. \u201cOur kind exists forever. We\u2019re strong. Capable. We understand our affliction. But with you? Even with tendencies, it\u2019s not feasible to risk. You\u2019re...weak. Vulnerable.\u201d His smile is wistful. \u201cI\u2019ve learned too vulnerable.\u201d</p><p>My interest is piqued, but I say nothing.</p><p>He notices.</p><p>Valerian paces. Slowly. Predatorlike. \u201cYou are an exception, though,\u201d he says, and rubs his finger over the flat surface of a discarded metal cabinet. \u201cYou always have been.\u201d</p><p>My insides lurch.</p><p>He stops behind me and smells my hair, then rounds on me. \u201cYou know, Riley,\u201d he says, dragging a knuckle across my cheek. \u201cYou look very much like your mother. Well,\u201d he says, smiling. \u201cLike she used to. Before.\u201d</p><p>Frozen inside, I lock my gaze to his. \u201cWhat do you know of my mother?\u201d</p><p>Valerian shrugs, but doesn\u2019t break his stare. His words are slow and calculating. \u201cI know that she was fiercely protective over you, even when you rebelled.\u201d He steps away from me, then turns. \u201cI also know she put up an impressive fight when your boyfriend killed her.\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cStupid boy.\u201d Then, his gaze turns white, his pupils pinpoint red. \u201cCouldn\u2019t follow simple directions.\u201d</p><p>Inside of my body, my oddly mixed blood turns to ice.</p><p>A slow smile lifts Valerian\u2019s mouth. \u201cAh, I see you understand now. What you might not know is that I did it for you, Riley.\u201d He sighs. \u201cAll I ever wanted was you.\u201d</p><p>I growl and lunge at him.</p><p>I capture nothing but air.</p><p>Valerian\u2019s low laugh comes from behind me. \u201cAh, Riley. Don\u2019t exert yourself. Save your strength,\u201d he says, then is suddenly so close to my back, our bodies touch. His whisper brushes my ear. \u201cYou\u2019ll need it.\u201d</p><p>Rage roils inside of me. \u201cYou killed my mother,\u201d I say under my breath.</p><p>\u201cTechnically, yes,\u201d Valerian admits. \u201cAlthough your young boyfriend actually did all the work.\u201d He shakes his head again. \u201cMessy, that one. His demise was anything but a loss. He had no fucking sense.\u201d</p><p>I lunge again, and this time I don\u2019t find air. I find the wall.</p><p>Then he\u2019s behind me, pressing his body against mine. With one hand securing mine, he forces the blade from my grasp and presses his lips to my ear. Be perfectly still, Riley. Don\u2019t move. Your limbs are weak. Your muscles frozen. Listen to me closely.</p><p>Instantly, I am unable to move.</p><p>\u201cAh, perfect. My brother noticed you first, but I immediately wanted you,\u201d he says in a whisper. He drags his lips over my jaw. \u201cRather, I wanted your blood.\u201d</p><p>I tense. My heart slams against my ribs, but it\u2019s a slow slam. Adrenaline rushes.</p><p>Valerian licks my throat. \u201cRelax, Riley,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m not going to kill you. That was never my intention.\u201d With one hand, he skims my back, my hip, my ass. \u201cYour blood was enigmatic then. Now? With that of the bloodline of my brother and me? It is irreplaceable.\u201d He nips my jaw with his teeth. \u201cAnd will make an unstoppable army.\u201d</p><p>I feel his hard cock press against my lower back. I try to summon every ounce of vampiric strength I possess, yet nothing happens. He has me. I cringe.</p><p>Reach behind you and touch me.</p><p>As if my hand has a mind of its own, I do as Valerian says. I run my hand over his hip, then grope his crotch. He groans in my ear.</p><p>Inside, I scream. Where are my goddamn tendencies?</p><p>Only then do I hear a new voice.</p><p>Riley, damn it, concentrate! You\u2019re stronger than he is.</p><p>My mind races as Eli\u2019s words rush through me. Stronger? Are you kidding me? I can\u2019t move! It\u2019s like he has me chained down. He killed my mother, Eli. He\u2019s watched me for all these years.</p><p>You\u2019ve got the DNA of three strigois, the Gullah, and Dupr\u00e9. Trust me. You have more strength than he could ever think of having. Use your mind, Riley. Not your physical strength. Get a grip and concentrate. And whatever you do, don\u2019t fucking kill him.</p><p>Valerian\u2019s hands find their way beneath my shirt, my tank, and he pulls me tightly against him. \u201cSee how easy this is for us? Me, telling you what to do, and you, doing it without question? You see, once I give you the orgasm of your entire life, I\u2019m going to take your blood.\u201d He kisses my throat. \u201cSome for myself, of course, and some for morphing. We\u2019ll make powerful children, Riley.\u201d He wraps his arms completely around my body and embraces me. \u201cWe\u2019ll be unstoppable.\u201d</p><p>Concentrate!</p><p>Eli\u2019s single command jolts me. I don\u2019t know where he is, but it sounds as if he\u2019s right in my ear. I draw a deep breath, clear my mind, and then focus on memories. Recent. The past. They all jumble together.</p><p>I let them.</p><p>A vision of my mother, dead, naked, pale, and lifeless, crowds my mind. Her eyes stare unseeing into mine as I drag her from the bathtub and cradle her in my arms. Another vision, of Seth\u2019s vampiric eyes staring hungrily into mine. Of the bloodbath at Bonaventure. Of more in Charleston, and of the sickening fight club in the old rectory. Of a young marine, dead. Of Estelle, roughly handled by a newling.</p><p>My mind spins out of control as horrific images assault me. All fault lies at the feet of one. Valerian Arcos.</p><p>Inside, I rage.</p><p>My inhuman powers then merge; I can feel it occur in my body. A current of energy rushes through me and abruptly halts at my feet, then shoots back up and through my fingers, my eyes. Inside my veins, the blood there feels like lava.</p><p>Then, as fast as it starts, it stops.</p><p>I look up. And everything is suddenly crystal clear. Julian\u2019s advice rings inside my head. I remember.</p><p>Remember your mother, Valerian? What happened to her? Did you kill her? Get off me now, Valerian Arcos, and move away. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou will not mention her!\u201d he says vehemently. \u201cDo not!\u201d</p><p>But my body is released, and Valerian, slowly, moves backward.</p><p>I turn and meet his gaze. It\u2019s wide, white, with pinpoint red pupils.</p> <p>They stare at me with horror and hatred.</p><p>I give another command. It comes out of the blue, yet somehow, it\u2019s perfect.</p><p>Suffer.</p><p>Valerian\u2019s body begins to quiver, and his eyes widen farther still. His face contorts, but not into his vampiric image. He seems to contort into pain.</p><p>More.</p> <p>A sob\u2014male, throaty, and desperate\u2014escapes from him. His body shakes uncontrollably. He drops to the floor. I stand over him, his eyes glaring up at me.</p><p>Agony. Fire. Strangulation.</p><p>Valerian\u2019s body thrashes uncontrollably; his hands fly to his neck as choking noises gurgle from his throat. Satisfaction courses through me as I watch him writhe in pain, imaginary flames licking his skin. With my mind, I force the delusion on him. Harder. Faster.</p><p>\u201cRiley, stop!\u201d</p><p>Although I hear the voice, I can\u2019t take my eyes off of Valerian. All the things that go along with finally finding a loved one\u2019s killer run through me. I take pleasure in watching his pain. His anguish. It must be something similar to what my mother experienced when she died. What all of those innocent people experienced. All because of selfish, pathetic Valerian.</p><p>On my thigh, a sheath is strapped. I reach for the blade, the silver turning cool in my hand. I envision the silver slipping easily through his flesh. Ending his sorry fucking existence.</p> <p>\u201cNo, ch\u00e8re,\u201d the voice said calmly. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>A hand goes to my shoulder. Gently. Firmly. I look up.</p><p>It takes a minute for my mind to register.</p><p>The first one I see is Eli.</p><p>Behind him, Noah, Phin, Jake, Darius, Gabriel, Seth, and Victorian.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t kill him,\u201d Victorian says. \u201cNo matter that you want to.\u201d</p><p>I look down at Valerian. His body is still now, staring up at me. I\u2019m holding him in some sort of weird abstraction without even trying.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll take him back to my father tonight,\u201d Victorian says, then puts a hand on my shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s over, Riley.\u201d</p> <p>Eli moves close, almost between Victorian and me.</p><p>The two stare off at one another.</p><p>\u201cMy team and I will accompany you and your brother back to Romania,\u201d Jake Andorra says to Victorian.</p><p>Victorian nods, but keeps his gaze locked on to mine. \u201cI must have a word with Riley first,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got him,\u201d Jake says, and grabs Valerian off the floor.</p><p>Surprisingly, Victorian looks at Eli. \u201cDo you mind?\u201d</p><p>My eyes flash to Eli\u2019s, and I know his answer before he says it.</p><p>\u201cHell yes, I mind. But she doesn\u2019t. Go ahead. And keep your hands to yourself.\u201d</p><p>Anger is surfacing inside me, and maybe it\u2019s because I already know what Victorian is about to tell me. Doesn\u2019t matter. I allow him to grasp me by the elbow and lead me out of the dingy little concrete room.</p><p>In seconds, we\u2019re outside. The moon hangs low, more than a crescent now, and the air is chilled. A light pours from a single lamp beside the entrance of the facility. It\u2019s enough to cast Victorian\u2019s beautiful face into odd planes and shadows.</p><p>\u201cI never wanted Valerian to have you,\u201d he begins. \u201cI tried my best to warn you away, but I was powerless in my tomb. I knew of your lover, and of Valerian\u2019s plan to have him kill your mother.\u201d Anguish forces his features into a frown. \u201cI couldn\u2019t stop him. He\u2019s always been stronger than me. Even entombed.\u201d</p><p>He places a hand on my jaw and tilts my head toward him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Riley. I wish I could change things. I wish I could bring your mother back.\u201d</p><p>My heart eases a bit. Valerian\u2019s power over Victorian is just as easily believed as his power over me. \u201cI understand, Vic.\u201d I place my hand over his, at my jaw. \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d It\u2019s not okay, but it\u2019s not Vic\u2019s fault. I know that.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make sure his punishment is delivered,\u201d he says. \u201cI vow it.\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cMultumesc.\u201d</p><p>Victorian cocks his head. \u201cMy native tongue sounds good\u201d\u2014he smiles\u2014\u201con your tongue.\u201d</p><p>I softly laugh. \u201cPerv.\u201d</p><p>His eyes soften. \u201cI wish I could keep you,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve loved you your whole life. Ever since you were a child. I...wish you\u2019d choose me over him.\u201d</p><p>I sigh. \u201cVictorian, don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Beneath the moonlight, he looks at me. Sincerity gleams in his inhuman eyes. \u201cPromise me something, Riley Poe.\u201d</p><p>I look up at him. Waiting.</p><p>He smiles when I don\u2019t readily agree. \u201cPromise me that if ever there\u2019s a time when you tire of him, you\u2019ll call me.\u201d He kisses my cheek, and pulls back and pins me with a steady gaze. \u201cI will wait for you.\u201d</p><p>I hold my gaze to his, too. \u201cI\u2019ve always been drawn to you, Vic. I\u2019ve never been able to explain it to myself, but I have.\u201d I smile. \u201cDon\u2019t take this the wrong way,\u201d I say, and wrap my arms around his neck. \u201cTake care.\u201d I hug him hard. \u201cE-mail me.\u201d</p><p>I feel his body quake with laughter. \u201cWe\u2019re vampires, Riley,\u201d he says, pulling back and smiling. \u201cNo need to e-mail when you can cyber chat\u201d\u2014he taps my temple\u2014\u201chere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as you stay out of the personal info,\u201d I remind him. \u201cAnd no dirty talking.\u201d</p><p>Victorian shrugs. \u201cI\u2019m still a man. That is a promise I cannot make.\u201d</p><p>I laugh, and turn to leave. \u201cBe careful, Vic\u2014\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m grabbed by the arm and swung quickly and determinedly into Victorian\u2019s embrace. His mouth descends upon mine in a fervent kiss so fast, my head spins.</p><p>Literally.</p><p>Just as fast, he releases me.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he says, backing away. \u201cI couldn\u2019t help myself.\u201d</p><p>I simply shake my head.</p><p>Valerian is tethered and within the hour is taken away by Victorian, Jake, and the others. Eli, Phin, and Seth remain behind.</p><p>\u201cThere are more out there,\u201d Phin says grimly. His eyes glisten in the light of the moon. \u201cIt\u2019ll take time to collect them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least Valerian won\u2019t be able to manipulate their minds,\u201d Seth says.</p><p>\u201cThere is that,\u201d Eli says. He looks at me. \u201cReady?\u201d</p><p>I glance around me, at the facility. At the island. \u201cYeah. I am.\u201d</p><p>Seth drapes an arm over my shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019ve got some wicked tendencies, Ri,\u201d he says. \u201cDo you even remember what you were doing to Valerian?\u201d</p><p>I think about it. \u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll come,\u201d Phin says. \u201cYou\u2019ll learn more control over time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd flexion of your mind muscles,\u201d adds Eli. He grins. \u201cGood thing you have more time now.\u201d</p><p>I hug my brother and look sideways at him as we walk to the skiff. It\u2019s hard to believe that a few short months ago, he was experiencing a quickening. Floating to the top of his room, for God\u2019s sake. So much has changed.</p><p>We\u2019ve all changed.</p><p>The ride back to the mainland is a fast one. It\u2019s early\u2014too early\u2014to visit with Preacher and Estelle, or Nyx. Phin and Seth step out of the Jeep as we park on the merchant\u2019s drive behind Inksomnia. Just as we near the door, Eli pulls me to a stop.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve got something to show you.\u201d</p><p>I glance at Seth and Phin and shrug. \u201cLater.\u201d</p><p>They both grin and head inside.</p><p>Eli links his fingers through mine and we get back into the Jeep.</p><p>\u201cHow tired are you?\u201d he asks, and the tone in his voice makes me shiver.</p><p>\u201cNot tired at all,\u201d I answer.</p><p>We take off across Bay Street and down Abercorn.</p><p>For the first time in months, I notice a particular ease in the air. The chill is right. The crisp is right. The rustle of leaves is right.</p><p>Being beside Eli Dupr\u00e9 is even more right.</p><p>Twenty minutes from downtown and just off Waters Avenue, across from the old white concrete Cresthill Baptist Church, Eli turns down Beckman Avenue. It\u2019s an older residential street, with houses built in the forties and fifties. Some a little newer. Some ways down, Eli turns in to a corner lot and stops the Jeep. The drive is a half circle lined with aged azalea bushes that are probably gorgeous in the spring when in full bloom. The house is an older concrete block house, single story, with several tall pine trees towering overhead. A wooden swing sits suspended between two of them. I glance at Eli.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d I ask.</p><p>A crooked grin splits Eli\u2019s face in two, and for a moment, he\u2019s not a vampire. He\u2019s a mischievous guy up to something.</p><p>I guess he can be both.</p><p>Eli\u2019s gaze lingers on my mouth, then meets my eyes. \u201cMy new house.\u201d</p><p>I feel my eyes bug out. \u201cAre you serious?\u201d I glance back at the older home, then back to Eli. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>He shrugs. \u201cI met a man once, years ago. He\u2019d just returned from the war\u2014as in World War Two\u2014and had started working for the electric company. He had a sweet wife named Frances and a beautiful baby daughter named Dale. I watched him one day break up a fight between two mean-asses who\u2019d jumped this skinny kid. Cracked the two bullies\u2019 heads together. Knocked them senseless.\u201d Eli\u2019s gaze moves from mine to a place above me, and he concentrates as he pulls the memory back. He smiles. \u201cHis name was Wimpy. He gave me a job making hush puppies.\u201d He inclines his head toward the concrete house. \u201cHe built this. Raised a family here. Had three more children. He helped build that church back there.\u201d Eli slips from the Jeep and walks around to my side. \u201cI watched his little blond-haired granddaughter, Cindy, come here every single summer and swing on that swing.\u201d He points to where it was. \u201cShe had a little friend just down the road and they\u2019d play together nearly every day. Cindy and Julie. They were inseparable.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I look at Eli, wondering where he was going with all of this. It sounds great to me, like I\u2019m hearing about someone from my own family.</p><p>From the family I could\u2019ve had.</p><p>Eli knows I\u2019m perplexed, and smiles. \u201cI\u2019ll never forget the summer of nineteen seventy-six. Cindy was ten. She ran around with a Jaws T-shirt on nearly the whole summer.\u201d He shakes his head and laughs. \u201cI\u2019ll have to tell you a funny story about her later. About who she is, what she became. Maybe even take you to meet her. Later, though.\u201d He glances toward the house again. \u201cThe property runs straight down to the Vernon River. Wimpy\u2019s wife, Frances, used to go down to the dock and catch blue crabs by the basketfuls.\u201d Another winsome smile touches his lips. \u201cHe built a dock over the marsh back in the fiftes. I\u2019ve had some repairs made, and...\u201d He grasps my hand. \u201cWell, come see for yourself.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m, for a change, speechless as Eli leads me across the yard, back toward the woods where a small worn path leads to the marsh. The brine is perfect and pungent, and just the slightest breeze rustles the saw grass. We cross the marsh on a newly repaired dock, and at the end sits a small covered screened-in dock house with a red tin roof. Eli stops, steps inside, and grabs blankets from a plastic storage bin in the corner. The screen door creaks and slams behind him as he pulls me down the plank to a small floating dock.</p><p>Without a word, he spreads two blankets on the dock, and rolls a third long-ways and places it at one end. He holds out a hand. \u201cSit down.\u201d</p><p>I grin and do as he asks.</p><p>Silently, he kneels and removes my boots and socks. He rolls up my jeans. Then he sits, kicks off his boots and socks, and does the same. He sticks his feet into the water, and I do the same. He sits close to me, our shoulders brushing. He looks up.</p><p>\u201cMagnificent spray of stars, don\u2019t you think?\u201d he says.</p> <p>I turn my head and look at him. \u201cWhat are you doing, Eligius Dupr\u00e9?\u201d</p><p>Eli\u2019s smile is blinding. \u201cI love it when you use my full name.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head and wait.</p><p>He looks at me. \u201cI always secretly wanted what Wimpy had. Family. Loving, devoted wife.\u201d He laughs softly. \u201cThey called each other monkey. Their pet name for each other.\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cFunniest damn thing I\u2019d ever heard. Wimpy made magic happen here, Riley.\u201d He smiles and shrugs. \u201cHe had a great life. I want it. And I want you to share it with me.\u201d</p><p>My heart leaps. It almost stops.</p><p>With two hands, Eli grasps my face. His gaze passes over my mouth, my nose, then to my eyes. \u201cI want to marry you, Riley Poe. And if you don\u2019t say yes now, I\u2019ll keep asking until you do.\u201d</p> <p>Even in the fading light, I can see the cerulean blue brightness of Eli\u2019s eyes sparkle. The slight scruff that perpetually remained on his jaw, the fall of dark hair over his forehead, and that crazy silver hoop he still wore in his brow\u2014all of it Eli.</p><p>And he wants to marry me.</p><p>Suddenly, my past becomes a faint memory of someone who could\u2019ve been anyone other than me. The pain of my mother\u2019s death, though still present, dulls. I feel I can accomplish anything with this unique man by my side.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say softly. I\u2019m looking into his eyes. They soften. He smiles.</p><p>His kiss rocks me.</p><p>Gentle at first, his lips brush mine, linger against me, and although I know he doesn\u2019t need air to breathe, you\u2019d never know it. He sighs against my mouth. The sweet taste of him makes my head spin. He pulls me into a tight embrace.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he whispers against my ear. \u201cI love you, Riley. More than you know.\u201d</p><p>I squeeze him in return. \u201cI love you, Eligius Dupr\u00e9,\u201d I say, then pull back and look at him. \u201cI think I have from the first moment I saw you.\u201d</p> <p>He grins. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have a lot of work ahead of us though,\u201d I say. \u201cJake wants to hire us. Together. Like Turner and Hootch. Miami Vice. Scarecrow and Mrs. King.\u201d</p><p>Eli shakes his head. \u201cYeah. I know.\u201d He kisses me again. \u201cGood thing we have years and years to be together.\u201d</p><p>With the water lapping at our ankles, we sit. We talk. We plan.</p><p>For the night, we\u2019re a normal couple in love.</p><p>I guess this is something I\u2019ll have to get used to, and I pray to God I can one day control it. I can\u2019t just run around having people touch me, inadvertently hurling me into their bodies only for me to experience some mind/body/life altering event that I can somehow change or help. I mean seriously.</p><p>Or can I?</p><p>All I know is that Seth and Eli are my world. Preacher and Estelle are my world. The Dupr\u00e9s are my family, and I have a shitload of the most bizarre friends a person can have.</p><p>But I\u2019m not a person, am I? Hell no. I\u2019m an abomination. Human, but not. Vampiric qualities, but thankfully, not a bloodsucker. I can be killed, but I won\u2019t naturally die on my own for hundreds of years. And lucky for me, the aging process is slow. I\u2019ll look twenty-five for a helluva long time. That\u2019s a plus. No Botox for me.</p><p>I\u2019m grateful, in a way, that Seth shares the same fate as me. Probably not to the severity, since he\u2019s only had one vampiric encounter, and me, four. But we\u2019ll have a longer life together, and that suits me. I can\u2019t imagine life without my little bro.</p><p>So, all in all, I\u2019m adjusting. To what, exactly, I\u2019m not sure. I still love to ink. Sketch designs. I\u2019m proud of my work and my accomplishments. But I\u2019m now heavily considering passing ownership over to Nyx, occasionally inking when I\u2019m in town, and then utilize for the good these crazy ass powers I\u2019ve acquired. And since Eli and Seth are in it, along with Noah and Phin? Why the hell not.</p><p>We\u2019ll see.</p><p>I\u2019m sitting at Molly MacPhearson\u2019s. Across the room, a group of seven women has gathered, and after eavesdropping, I determine that they\u2019re celebrating a local author\u2019s new book release. Pretty cool. They all clink bottles of lager and say what I can only imagine is an inside joke, and then they all burst into laughter. They have the craziest names, too, like they\u2019ve all given each other nicknames. Gma. Cinny. Oogen. Auntie Betsy. Molly MacNugget. Bunty. Walowie. One of them\u2014Oogen\u2014gets up at everyone\u2019s urging, heads outside, and begins to pass back and forth in front of the window in some crazy little run. They all laugh. I don\u2019t get it, even though it is pretty hilarious. They\u2019re in tears, they\u2019re laughing so hard. A group of girlfriends, a night on the town celebrating a fine success. What fun. It\u2019s something I\u2019ve missed in life. But I have a family now, and a new group of friends. Sure, some of them are vampires, some werewolves, and some have been on the earth longer than dirt. But I like them. I watch the women a few minutes longer until they gather their belongings and leave. Still laughing. Calling one another vulgar names. It\u2019s so funny, I hate to see them go.</p><p>Until I notice him.</p><p>Eli stands beneath the awning at Belford\u2019s across the street. He sees me through the window. I see him, and I move outside toward him. My soul mate.</p><p>For now, even if for a few days, I want to enjoy my life. Live it as normal for at least one damn afternoon if possible. Eat a good meal. Have some good sex. Take a walk. A swim. Crack a few oysters on Da Island with Preacher and his family. That is, if Bhing hasn\u2019t torn the island up. Last I heard, her cleansing was pretty rocky. Mean as shit, I think I heard someone say. Poor little Bhing. Anyway. I just want to be freaking normal for a while.</p><p>Because very, very soon, I have a feeling I\u2019ll be boarding a plane for Scotland.</p><p>Jake says Edinburgh is being taken over by a band of nasty fallen angels and my tendencies just might come in handy. Ginger and Sydney seriously want me to join WUP. I\u2019m heavily considering it. I mean, what the hell else am I going to do with all this pent-up energy?</p><p>We\u2019ll see. For now, I\u2019m all about Eli Dupr\u00e9. And thankfully, he\u2019s all about me.</p><p>I\u2019m as content as I\u2019ll ever be.</p><p>I think my mom would be proud of how I\u2019ve turned out. And somewhere deep inside me, I feel she watches me, even now. I like that. Makes me feel close to her, as if she\u2019s right beside me.</p><p>I like to think that she truly is.</p><p>Who knows? I run with a pack of vampires, werewolves, and immortals. Who says ghosts aren\u2019t real? At this point in my strange existence, I\u2019ll believe just about anything. </p> </body></html>"]
