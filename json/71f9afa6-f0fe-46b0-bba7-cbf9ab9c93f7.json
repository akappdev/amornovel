Candy jerked me up by my hair and slammed my face into the asphalt.</p><p>Thud!</p> <p>\u201cHit her again!\u201d Michelle squeaked, her teenage voice shrill.</p><p>I knew it was a dream, because it didn\u2019t hurt. The fear was still there, that sharp, hot terror, mixed with helpless rage, the kind of fear that turns you from a human being into an animal. Things become distilled to simple concepts: I was small, they were big; I was weak, they were strong. They hurt me, and I endured.</p><p>Thud.</p><p>My skull bounced off the pavement. Blood stained my blond hair. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Sarah take a running start like a kicker before a field goal. The flesh on her body boiled. Bones grew, muscles wound around them like cotton candy over a stick, hair sprouted, sheathing the new body, half human, half animal, in a coat of pale sandy fur dappled with telltale hyena spots. The bouda grinned at me, her malformed mouth full of fangs. I clenched up, curling my ten-year-old self into a ball. The clawed foot crashed into my ribs. The three-inch claws scraped a bone and it crunched inside me like a snapped chopstick. She kept kicking me.</p><p>Thud, thud, thud!</p> <p>This was a dream. A dream grown from my memories, but still just a dream. I knew this, because ten years after my mother took eleven-year-old me and fled halfway across the country, I came back and put two bullets through Sarah\u2019s eyes. I had emptied a clip into Candy\u2019s left ear. I still remembered the way her skull had blossomed with red when the bullets tore out the other side. I had killed the entire werehyena clan. I wiped those bouda bitches off the face of the planet, because the world was a better place with them gone. Michelle was the only one who had escaped.</p><p>I sat up and grinned at them. \u201cI\u2019m waking up, ladies. Go fuck yourselves.\u201d</p><p>My eyes snapped open. I lay in my closet, wrapped in a blanket and holding a butcher knife. The door of the closet stood slightly ajar, and the gray light of early morning slipped through the narrow gap.</p><p>Fantastic. Andrea Nash, decorated veteran of the Order, hiding in her closet with her knife and a blankie. I should\u2019ve held on to the dream long enough to beat them into bloody pulp. At least then I wouldn\u2019t feel so completely pathetic.</p><p>I inhaled, sampling the air. The normal scents of my apartment floated to me, the hint of synthetic apple from the soap in the bathroom, the fragrance of vanilla from the candle by my bed, and strongest of all, the stench of dog fur, a leftover from when my friend Kate\u2019s poodle Grendel had kept me company. That freak of nature had slept at the foot of my bed, and his distinctive reek was permanently imprinted on my rug.</p><p>No intruders.</p> <p>The scents were muted, which meant the magic was down.</p><p>Thud-thud-thud!</p><p>What in the world?</p><p>Thud!</p><p>Someone was pounding on my door.</p><p>I kicked off my blanket, rolled to my feet, and ran out of the closet. My bedroom greeted me: my big bed, intruder-free; the crumpled mess of the blanket on the rug; my jeans and bra, discarded last night by the bed, next to a Lorna Sterling paperback with a pirate in a poofy shirt on the cover; bookcase, stuffed to the brim; pale blue curtains on the barred window, undisturbed.</p><p>I dropped the butcher knife onto my side table, pulled on my pajamas pants, grabbed my Sig-Sauer P226 from under the pillow, and ran to the door. Waking up with a gun in my hand would\u2019ve made a lot more sense, but no, I\u2019d woken up clutching a knife. That meant I must\u2019ve gotten up in the middle of the night, run into the kitchen, taken a knife from the butcher block, run back into the bedroom, grabbed a blanket, and hidden in the closet. All without realizing where I was or what I was doing. If that wasn\u2019t crazy, I didn\u2019t know what was.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t slept with a knife since I was a teenager. This blast from the past wasn\u2019t welcome and it needed to go away real fast.</p> <p>Thud-thud!</p><p>I reached the door and stood on my toes to look through the peephole. A tall black woman in her fifties stood on the other side. Her gray hair stuck out from her head in a mess, she was wearing a nightgown, and her face was so twisted by worry, I barely recognized her. Mrs. Haffey. She and her husband lived in an apartment right below me.</p><p>Normally Mrs. Haffey viewed her appearance as serious business. In terms of battle readiness, she was my hero\u2014I\u2019ve never seen her without her makeup and hair perfectly done. Something was really wrong.</p><p>I unlocked the door.</p><p>\u201cAndrea!\u201d Mrs. Haffey gasped. Behind her, long white strands covered the landing and the stairwell. I was one hundred percent sure they hadn\u2019t been there when I\u2019d dragged myself into my apartment last night.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarin\u2019s missing!\u201d</p><p>I pulled her into my apartment and shut the door. \u201cI need you to tell me from the beginning, slowly and clearly: what happened?\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Haffey took a deep breath. She had been a cop\u2019s wife for twenty-five years and her experience from dealing with a lifetime of emergencies kicked in. Her voice was almost steady. \u201cI woke up and made coffee. Darin got up to take Chief outside. I took a shower. When I came out, Darin wasn\u2019t back. I went out on the balcony, but he wasn\u2019t in his usual spot.\u201d</p><p>I knew exactly where the usual spot was: two stories under my bedroom window, where the Haffeys\u2019 bulldog, Chief, preferred to mark his territory. I smelled it on my way to work every morning. Of course, Chief smelled my scent and it only made him more determined to pee his way to territorial supremacy.</p><p>\u201cI called and called Darin, and nothing. I tried to go downstairs. There\u2019s blood all over the landing and a white substance on the stairs and it\u2019s blocking the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid Mr. Haffey take his gun with him?\u201d</p><p>Mr. Haffey had retired from the Paranormal Activity Division of the Atlanta Police Department. PAD cops took their guns seriously. As far as I knew, Darin Haffey never left the house without his Smith &amp; Wesson M&amp;P340 snub-nosed revolver.</p><p>\u201cHe always takes his gun with him,\u201d Mrs. Haffey said.</p><p>And he hadn\u2019t fired it, because his revolver ate .357 Magnum cartridges. When he pulled the trigger, the shot sounded like a small cannon going off. I would\u2019ve heard the gunshot and recognized it even through the dream. Whatever happened, happened fast.</p><p>The mysterious \u201cwhite substance\u201d must\u2019ve appeared as a result of the magic wave last night. Kate, my best friend, had warded my apartment months ago. Invisible spells shielded my place in a protective barrier. She\u2019d covered the perimeter walls, the ceiling, and the floor. Anything magic would have a hard time breaking in, which probably explained why I\u2019d slept safe and secure through the night.</p><p>\u201cYou know Darin\u2019s blind as a bat.\u201d Mrs. Haffey twisted her hands. \u201cHe can\u2019t even see what he\u2019s shooting at. The other day he comes running out of the bathroom, screaming and foaming at the mouth. He\u2019d brushed his teeth with Aspercreme instead of toothpaste...\u201d</p><p>A note of hysteria slipped into her voice. At five ten, she had eight inches of height on me and she was leaning over. \u201cI called down to the station, but they say it will be twenty minutes or longer. I thought since you were with the Order...\u201d</p><p>I used to be with the Order. When I was a Knight of Merciful Aid, it was my job to help people when the cops wouldn\u2019t or couldn\u2019t assist them with the magic hazmat. I had decorations and a stellar service record, but none of it mattered when the Order found out that I was a shapeshifter. They branded me mentally disturbed and unfit for duty and \u201cretired\u201d me.</p><p>But they didn\u2019t take away my training or my skills.</p><p>I pressed a latch in my wall. A panel slid aside, revealing a small niche that used to be a hallway closet and which I had converted into my own personal armory. A row of gun barrels gleamed in the morning light.</p><p>Mrs. Haffey clicked her mouth shut.</p><p>Let\u2019s see. I\u2019d be bringing my Sigs, but I needed something with more power. The AA-12, an Automatic Assault 12-gauge shotgun with a 32-round clip was always a good choice. It fired 300 rounds per minute with minimal recoil. I filled mine with steel slugs. Squeeze the trigger once, and get a single shot that would punch through a car door. Hold the trigger, and anything on the other end, no matter how much hard body armor it wore, would become a smoking pile of meat in six and a half seconds. I\u2019d paid a fortune for it and it was worth every dollar.</p><p>I grabbed the AA-12 and put on a hip holster, into which I stuck my Sig and its twin. \u201cMrs. Haffey, I need you to stay here.\u201d I gave her a nice big smile. \u201cLock the door behind me and don\u2019t open it until I come back. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Haffey nodded.</p><p>\u201cThank you, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>I stepped onto the landing and heard the deadbolt slide shut behind me.</p><p>The \u201cwhite substance\u201d stretched in long pale strands over the walls. It resembled a spiderweb, if the spider was the size of a bowling ball and instead of working in a spiral had decided to weave only in a vertical direction. I crossed the landing and inhaled. Usually there was an up-draft here, the air rising from the front entrance to the top of the building. Today no movement troubled the stairway, but I smelled the sharp metallic odor of fresh blood all the same. Tiny hairs on the back of my neck stood up. The predator in me, the other me sleeping deep inside, opened her eyes.</p><p>I padded down the stairs, moving silently on the concrete steps, my shotgun ready. Even though magic made my existence possible, it didn\u2019t mean that magic and I played nice. Give me guns over spells any day.</p><p>The web grew thicker. At the Haffeys\u2019 landing, it swallowed the walls and the wooden stair rail. I turned, heading down. The stench of blood assaulted my nostrils and I tasted it on my tongue. All of my senses went into overdrive. My heart beat faster. My pupils dilated, improving my vision. My breathing sped up. My hearing sharpened and I caught a distant noise, muffled, but unmistakable: the deep, throaty bark of a bulldog.</p><p>I took a few more steps down. Blood stained the stairs. A large amount, at least a couple of pints, possibly more, all in big round drops. Either someone bled and walked, or someone bled and was carried. Please don\u2019t be Darin. I liked Darin and I liked his wife. Mrs. Haffey was always kind to me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The first floor landing was a narrow tunnel within the web. The door to apartment 1A was intact, but buried in white strands. The same solid wall of white sealed the way downstairs, and none of it was torn. No sign of Darin going that way. The door to 1B lay in a splintered wreck. Bloody marks stretched across the threshold, pointing into the apartment. Someone had been dragged inside.</p><p>I stepped into the hallway. A new scent tugged at me, a slightly sour, prickly odor that set off instinctual alarms in my head. Not good.</p><p>The apartment had the exact same layout as mine: a narrow hallway, opening into the kitchen on the right, the living room on the left, then the first bedroom, and then a short perpendicular hallway leading to the utility room and guest bathroom, and finally to the master bedroom with a bathroom en suite.</p> <p>I moved in, nice and easy, slicing the pie around the corner: starting at the wall and moving at a ninety degree angle away from it, leaning slightly away from the wall to see the threat around the corner before it saw me. Jumping around the corners was very dramatic but would get your head blown off.</p><p>Kitchen\u2014clear.</p><p>I moved into the living room.</p><p>On the left, by a coffee table, sat a large wicker basket full of yarn. Two long wooden needles stuck out of it at an angle. Next to the basket lay a severed human arm. The blood had pooled from it, soaking the beige wall-to-wall carpet in a dark red stain.</p><p>Pale skin. Not Darin Haffey. No, this was likely Mrs. Truman who lived in this apartment with her two cats. She liked to play bridge with her knitting club and collected yarn for \u201cspecial\u201d projects, with which she never did anything. Now her torn-off arm lay next to the basket with her knitting stash. No time to absorb and deal with it. I still had Darin to find.</p> <p>I moved on. The sour prickly scent grew stronger.</p><p>Bedroom\u2014clear. Bathroom\u2014clear.</p><p>A huge hole gaped in the floor of the utility room. Something had smashed through the floor and tile from below.</p><p>I circled the hole, shotgun pointing down.</p><p>No movement. The floor below me looked clear.</p><p>A muffled noise cut through the quiet.</p> <p>My ears twitched.</p><p>Woof! Woof!</p><p>Chief was still alive somewhere in there. I jumped into the hole, landed on the concrete floor of the basement, and moved away from the light streaming through the hole. No need to present a clear target.</p><p>Gloom filled the basement, dripping from the web into dark corners. The walls no longer existed. There was only web, white and endless.</p><p>My eyes adjusted to the darkness. Shapeshifter vision guaranteed that as long as there was some light, I wouldn\u2019t bump into things.</p><p>Wet dark smears marred the concrete. Blood. I followed it.</p><p>Ahead the concrete split. A long fissure ran through the floor, at least three feet wide. The apartment building was already none too sturdy. The magic hated tall buildings and gnawed on them, pulverizing brick and mortar until the structure crashed down. The bigger the building, the faster it fell. Ours was too short and too small and so far we had escaped unscathed, but giant holes in the basement didn\u2019t exactly inspire confidence.</p><p>A snorting noise came from inside the gap. I leaned over it. A whiff of dog-fur stink washed over me. Chief, you silly knucklehead.</p> <p>I crouched by the hole. The bulldog squirmed below, snorting up a storm. He must\u2019ve fallen into the fissure, and the drop was too sheer for him to jump out.</p><p>I put my shotgun on the ground and leaned in, grabbing Chief by the scruff of his neck. The bulldog weighed eighty pounds at least. What in the world were the Haffeys feeding him, small elephants? I yanked him out and jumped to my feet, shotgun in my hands. The whole thing took half a second.</p><p>Chief pressed against my leg. He was an Olde English Bulldogge, a throwback to the times when the English Bulldog was used for bull-baiting. A powerful, agile dog, Chief feared neither garbage trucks, nor stray dogs or horses. Yet here he was, rubbing against my calf, freaked out.</p><p>I took a second to bend down and pet his big head. It will be okay, boy. You\u2019re with me now.</p><p>We started forward, moving slowly out of the first narrow room into a wider chamber. The web spanned the walls, creating hiding spots in the corners. Creepy as hell.</p><p>I carefully rounded the corner. At the far wall to my right, two furnaces sat side by side: the electric for the times when technology had the upper hand and the old-fashioned coal-burning monstrosity for use during the waves, when the magic robbed us of electric current. To the right of the coal furnace stood a large coal bin, a four-foot-high wooden enclosure filled with coal. On the coal, half-buried, lay Mr. Haffey.</p><p>Two creatures crawled on the concrete in front of the bin. About thirty inches tall and at least five feet long, they resembled huge wingless wasps, with a wide thorax-chest slimming down before flaring into thick abdomen. Stiff brown bristles covered their beige, nearly translucent bodies. Their heads, bigger than Chief\u2019s massive skull, bore mandibles the size of garden shears. Their claws scraped the concrete as they moved\u2014an eerie, nasty sound.</p><p>The left creature stopped and planted its six chitin-sheathed legs. Its tail end tilted up and a stream of viscous liquid shot out, adhering to the wall. The creature scrubbed its butt on the floor, anchoring the stream, and moved away as the secretions hardened into pale web.</p><p>Ew. Ew, ew, ew.</p><p>Mr. Haffey raised his head.</p><p>The creatures stopped, fixated on the movement.</p><p>I fired.</p><p>The shotgun barked, spitting thunder. The first steel slug punched into the right creature, cutting through the chitin like it was paper-thin plywood. The insect broke in half. Wet innards spilled onto the floor, like a bunch of swim bladders strung together. Without a pause, I turned and put a second shot into its buddy. Chief barked next to me, snapping his jaws. The creatures jerked and flailed, dragging their body chunks. The sour, spike-studded odor filled the air.</p><p>Darin Haffey sat up in the bin. \u201cI see Kayla dragged you into this.\u201d</p><p>I smiled at him. \u201cNo, sir, I just came to borrow a cup of sugar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeh.\u201d</p><p>The web obscuring the rest of the room to my left tore.</p><p>\u201cIncoming,\u201d Mr. Haffey snapped, raising his firearm.</p><p>The first insect burst into the open. I fired. Boom!</p><p>Two more. Boom, boom!</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Boom, boom, boom!</p><p>The broken chitin bodies crashed into each other, making a pile of jerking legs and vomit-inducing entrails.</p><p>Boom, boom, boom! Boom!</p><p>An insect leaped over the pile, aiming for me. I swung the shotgun up. The impact exploded the creature\u2019s gut, spraying foul liquid over me. Bug juice burned my lips. Ugh.</p><p>A smaller insect dashed toward me. Sharp mandibles sliced at my leg. You bastard! Chief rammed the creature, ripping into the thing before I could sink a slug into it.</p><p>Boom! Boom!</p><p>I kept firing. Finally the revolting flood stopped. I waited, listening, but no more skittering came. My calf burned. The pain didn\u2019t bother me too much, but I\u2019d be leaving a blood trail, which would make me ridiculously easy to track. I had five shots left in the AA-12. No way to know if I had killed them all or if this was the calm before the second wave of insects. I had to get Mr. Haffey out of here.</p><p>He was sitting in the coal bin, staring at the pile of insect parts. \u201cDamn. That\u2019s some shooting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe aim to please,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cYou aim like you mean business.\u201d</p><p>Funny thing, praise. I knew I was a great shot, but hearing it from the PAD veteran made me all warm and fuzzy anyway. \u201cHave you seen Mrs. Truman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw her body. They ripped her to pieces, the assholes.\u201d</p><p>Poor Mrs. Truman. \u201cCan you walk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe fuckers got me in the leg. I\u2019m bleeding like a stuck pig.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s why he\u2019d hidden in the coal. He\u2019d buried his leg in the coal dust to smother the scent. Smart. \u201cTime to go, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou listen to me.\u201d Mr. Haffey put some cop hardness into his gruff voice. \u201cThere\u2019s no way for you to get me out. Even if I lean on you, I\u2019m two hundred and twenty pounds and my weight will just take you down with me. Leave me a gun, and you get out of here. Kayla must\u2019ve called over to the station. I\u2019ll hold them off until...\u201d</p><p>I swung the shotgun over my shoulder and picked him up out of the coal. I wasn\u2019t as strong as a normal shapeshifter, although I was faster and more agile, but a two-hundred-pound man still wasn\u2019t a challenge.</p><p>I double-timed it to the hole, Chief at my heels. The bulldog had a death grip on a chitinous leg as long as he was. He had to lean his head back to carry it, but the look in his eyes said no army in the world could take it away.</p><p>\u201cThis is embarrassing,\u201d Mr. Haffey informed me.</p><p>I winked at him. \u201cWhat, Mrs. Haffey never carried you over the threshold on your wedding night?\u201d</p><p>His eyes bulged. \u201cThat\u2019s just ridiculous. What are you?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d spent most of my life pretending to be human. But now the hyena was out of the bag, and sooner or later I had to start owning up to it. \u201cA shapeshifter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWolf?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA bouda.\u201d Well, not exactly. The truth was more complicated, but I wasn\u2019t ready for those explanations yet.</p><p>We reached the hole. If I were a regular bouda, I could\u2019ve jumped out of the hole with Mr. Haffey in my arms. But I knew my limits and that wasn\u2019t happening. Throwing him out would injure his dignity beyond repair. \u201cI\u2019m going to lift you. Can you pull yourself up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs the Pope Catholic?\u201d</p><p>I lowered him down, grabbed him by the hips, and heaved. Mr. Haffey pulled himself over the ledge and I got a real close look at that wound. It was a four-inch rip down his leg and touching his sweatpants left my palm bloody. He needed an ambulance yesterday.</p><p>I tossed Chief and his prize out of the hole, jumped, caught the edge, and hopped up.</p><p>\u201cWill you at least carry me fireman-style?\u201d Mr. Haffey huffed.</p><p>\u201cNo can do, sir. I\u2019m trying to keep your blood from dripping out of your leg.\u201d</p><p>He growled deep under his breath.</p><p>I picked him up and started out. \u201cIt will all be over soon.\u201d</p><p>He guffawed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I caught the familiar scuttling sound behind me, coming from the master bedroom.</p><p>\u201cI thought the Order didn\u2019t allow shapeshifters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t. When they figured me out, they fired me.\u201d</p> <p>The scuttling chased us.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s bullshit right there.\u201d Mr. Haffey shook his head. \u201cAnd discrimination. You talk to your union rep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I did. I fought it as long as I could. Anyway, they retired me with full pension. I can\u2019t appeal.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Haffey gave me an appraising look. \u201cYou took it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. Told them to shove it.\u201d</p> <p>I dropped him to the floor as gently as I could and spun, shotgun ready.</p><p>A huge pale insect lunged at us. I pumped two slugs into it and it thrashed on the floor. I gathered Mr. Haffey up and double-timed it to the door.</p><p>\u201cListen, most of my contacts have retired, but a few of us have kids in the department. If you need a job, I can probably fix up something. The PAD will be glad to have you. You\u2019re a hell of a shot. Shouldn\u2019t let that go to waste.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMuch appreciated.\u201d I smiled. \u201cBut I\u2019ve got a job. I work for a business. My best friend owns it.\u201d I started up the stairs.</p><p>\u201cWhat sort of business?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMagic hazmat removal. Protection. That type of thing.\u201d</p> <p>Mr. Haffey opened his eyes. \u201cPrivate cop? You went private?\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s cop mentality for you. I tell him I\u2019m a shapeshifter and he doesn\u2019t blink an eye. But private cop, oh no, that\u2019s not okay.</p><p>\u201cSo how\u2019s business?\u201d Mr. Haffey squinted at me.</p><p>\u201cBusiness is fine.\u201d If by fine, one meant lousy. Between Kate Daniels and me, we had a wealth of skills, a small sea of experience, and enough smears on our reputation to kill a dozen careers. All of our clients were desperate, because by the time they came to us, everybody else had turned them down.</p><p>\u201cWhat does your man think about that?\u201d</p><p>Raphael Medrano. The memory of him was so raw, I could conjure his scent by just thinking about him. The strong male healthy scent that drove me crazy...</p><p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t work out,\u201d I said.</p><p>Mr. Haffey shifted, uncomfortable. \u201cYou need to drop that silliness and get back in uniform. We\u2019re talking retirement, benefits, advance in rank and pay...\u201d</p> <p>I ran up to my door. \u201cMrs. Haffey!\u201d</p><p>The door swung open. Mrs. Haffey\u2019s face went slack. \u201cOh my God, Darin. Oh God.\u201d</p><p>In the distance the familiar sirens blared.</p><p>The cavalry arrived with guns and in large numbers. They loaded Mr. Haffey into an ambulance, thanked me for my help, and told me that since I was a civilian, I needed to keep the hell out of their way. I didn\u2019t mind. I\u2019d killed most of what was down there and they had gotten all dressed up and gone through the trouble of bringing flamethrowers. It was only fair to let them have some fun.</p><p>I tended the cut on my leg. There wasn\u2019t much to do about it. Lyc-V, the virus responsible for shapeshifters\u2019 existence, repaired injuries at an accelerated rate, and by the time I got to it, the gash had sealed itself. In a couple of days, the leg would be like new, without scars. Some Lyc-V gifts were useful. Some, like berserker rage, I could live without.</p><p>I was scrubbing the bug juice off my face with my makeup removal washcloth, when the phone rang. I wiped the soap off my face and sprinted into the kitchen to pick it up.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNash?\u201d a smooth voice said into the phone.</p><p>The smooth voice belonged to Jim, a werejaguar and the Pack\u2019s security chief. He usually went by Jim Black, if you didn\u2019t know him well. I\u2019d dug through his background during my tenure with the Order. His real name was James Damael Shrapshire, a fact I kept to myself, since he didn\u2019t advertise it.</p><p>Atlanta\u2019s Shapeshifter Pack was the strongest in the nation, and my relationship with it was complicated. But the Pack backed Cutting Edge, the business Kate owned and for which I now worked. They had supplied the seed money and they were our first priority client.</p><p>\u201cHey, Jim. What can I do for you?\u201d Jim wasn\u2019t a bad guy. Paranoid and secretive, but then cats were odd creatures.</p><p>\u201cOne of our businesses got hit last night,\u201d Jim said. \u201cFour people are dead.\u201d</p><p>Someone obviously had a death wish and that someone wasn\u2019t very bright, because there were much easier ways of committing suicide. The Pack took care of their own and if you hurt their own, they made it a point to take care of you. \u201cAnybody I know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Two jackals, a bouda, and a fox from Clan Nimble. I need you to go down there and check it out.\u201d</p><p>I headed into the bedroom. \u201cNo problem. But why me?\u201d</p><p>Jim sighed into the phone. \u201cAndrea, how many years did you spend as a knight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEight.\u201d I began pulling my clothes onto the bed: socks, work boots, jeans...</p><p>\u201cHow many of those did you spend on active cases?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeven.\u201d I added a box of ammo to the clothes pile on the bed.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why. You\u2019re the most experienced investigator I\u2019ve got who\u2019s not tied up in something, and I can\u2019t ask the Consort to look into it, because A) she and Curran are working on something else and B) when the Consort gets involved, half of the world blows up.\u201d</p><p>Kate the Consort. The title still made me grin. Every time someone used it, she got this martyred look on her face.</p><p>\u201cThis mess looks to be complicated and the cops are in up to their elbows. I need you to go down there and untangle it.\u201d</p><p>Finally. Something I could actually sink my teeth into.</p><p>I held the phone between my shoulder and my ear and took a pencil and a notepad off the nightstand. \u201cYou\u2019ve got an address?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFourteen-twelve Griffin.\u201d</p><p>Griffin Street ran through SoNo, one of the former financial districts, sandwiched between Midtown and Downtown. The name came from \u201cSouth of North Avenue.\u201d It was a bad, unstable area, with old office buildings crashing down left and right.</p><p>\u201cWhat were the shapeshifters doing there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorking,\u201d Jim said. \u201cIt\u2019s a reclamation site.\u201d</p><p>Reclamations. Oh no. No. He wouldn\u2019t do that to me. I kept my voice even. \u201cWho was in charge of the site?\u201d</p><p>Please don\u2019t be Raphael, please don\u2019t be Raphael, please don\u2019t...</p><p>\u201cMedrano Reclamations,\u201d Jim said.</p><p>Damn it.</p><p>\u201cRaphael is being questioned by some cops, but I\u2019ve sent some lawyers down to make sure they don\u2019t keep him. He\u2019ll join you as soon as they spring him out of there. Look, I know things aren\u2019t good between you and Raphael, but we all have to do things we don\u2019t want to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJim,\u201d I cut him off. \u201cI\u2019ve got it. A job is a job. I\u2019m on it.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 2</p><p>It took me forty-five minutes to make my way through the twisted wreck of the city to SoNo. The magic had really done a number on Atlanta. Downtown had suffered the most, but both Midtown and Buckhead had taken a beating. Once-stately skyscrapers lay in ruins, like the gravestones of human hopes, toppled on their sides. Overpasses crumbled into dust and new wooden bridges spanned the asphalt canyons. Debris choked the streets. Atlanta was still alive and kicking and the city was rebuilding little by little, but the sheer weight and volume of the fallen concrete made it problematic. I had to make a wide circle north around the wreckage.</p><p>On the corner of Monroe and 10th Street, something fluorescent had exploded, drenching the walls of the new houses in electric orange that smelled like day-old vomit. The city Biohazard crew narrowed the traffic to a single lane guarded by two guys with stop signs, who let the vehicles and riders through a few at a time, while the rest of the Biohazard team washed the orange pus down with fire hoses.</p><p>Around me, the morning traffic neighed, brayed, and defecated on the street. Gasoline vehicles failed during magic. My Jeep had two engines, one gas and the other enchanted water, so even when technology was down, my car still got me where I needed to go, reliably but not very fast. Buying a reconditioned car like mine was expensive, so most people opted for horses, camels, and mules. They worked whenever. They just didn\u2019t smell very good. It was the middle of May, and a hot one at that, and the reek rising from the pavement would have sent anyone running for cover.</p><p>To my left a man atop a white horse leveled a crossbow at the stop sign. The string twanged and a bolt punched through metal, right into the O. Bull\u2019s-eye.</p><p>The Biohazard guy thrust the injured sign against the Biohazard service truck, pulled a shotgun from the truck bed, and leveled it at the crossbowman.</p><p>\u201cMake my day, bitch! Make my day!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you and your sign!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d a woman yelled. \u201cThere are children here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cPiss off!\u201d the rider told her and pointed the crossbow at the Biohazard dude. \u201cLet me through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Wait your turn like everybody else.\u201d</p><p>I could tell by their faces that neither of them would shoot. They\u2019d just talk shit and waste everyone\u2019s time and as long as the Biohazard guy bickered with the moron on the horse, he wasn\u2019t waving the traffic through. At this rate I would never make it to my crime scene.</p><p>\u201cHey, dickhead!\u201d one of the other drivers yelled. \u201cGet off the road!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis here is a Falcon Seven,\u201d the rider told him. \u201cI can put a bolt through your windshield and pin you to your seat like a bug.\u201d</p><p>A direct threat, huh? Okay.</p><p>I pulled down my sunglasses a bit so the rider would see my eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s a nice crossbow.\u201d</p><p>He glanced in my direction. He saw a friendly blond girl with a big smile and a light Texas accent and didn\u2019t get alarmed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got what, a seventy-five-pound draw on it? Takes you about four seconds to reload?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree,\u201d he said.</p><p>I gave him my Order smile: sweet grin, hard eyes, reached over to my passenger seat, and pulled out my submachine gun. About twenty-seven inches long, the HK was my favorite toy for close-quarters combat. The rider\u2019s eyes went wide. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThis is an HK UMP submachine gun.

Please carry on.\u201d</p><p>Ten seconds later, I got through the roadblock, steered the Jeep down Monroe Street, and turned right onto North Avenue. I made it two blocks before the street ended in a mountain of crushed glass. This intrepid adventure would have to continue on foot. I parked, checked my guns, took my crime scene kit out of the trunk, and jogged down the street.</p><p>Maybe Raphael wouldn\u2019t be there.</p><p>Sooner or later I would have to interview him. My heart rate sped up at the thought. I took deeper breaths until it slowed. I had a job to do. The Order might not think I was worth much, but the Pack obviously did. I would be professional about it.</p> <p>Professional. Just the facts, ma\u2019am. Move along, there is nothing to see here. No need to panic.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t my first case and this wasn\u2019t my first murder. It was a chance at work that mattered and I would not blow it by making a spectacle of myself.</p><p>Fourteen-twelve Griffin resembled a small hill of twisted metal, decorated with chunks of concrete, mixed with dirty marble, piles of shattered bluish glass, and fine gray dust, the result of magic\u2019s fangs grinding at the substance of the building. A backhoe and some other heavy-duty construction vehicle the name of which I didn\u2019t know sat across the street, next to a tent.</p><p>A reinforced tunnel led inside the hill, with two shapeshifters standing guard. The one on the left, in dark jeans and a black T-shirt, was a male bouda in his late thirties, lean, dark, with an easy smile. I\u2019d met him before\u2014his name was Stefan and he and I had no problems. Like most boudas, he was good with a knife and occasionally, if his opponents really pissed him off, he would scalp them after he killed them.</p><p>The other shapeshifter, on the right, was larger, younger, and dark-eyed, with chestnut hair cropped short. I inhaled his scent. A werejackal.</p><p>I came to a halt before the tunnel. Stefan\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cHey, you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHey, yourself.\u201d</p><p>The jackal gave me a long look. I wore a white long-sleeved shirt, brown pants, and a leather vest over it. The vest\u2019s main advantage was its million pockets. My two Sigs rested in twin shoulder holsters. The jackal\u2019s nose wrinkled. That\u2019s right, I don\u2019t smell like a normal bouda.</p><p>\u201cJim sent me,\u201d I told Stefan.</p><p>Stefan raised his eyebrows. \u201cThat Jim?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup. Did Raphael make it back from the cops?\u201d My insides clenched up.</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>Thank God. I was a coward. A terrible, sad coward. \u201cI need to examine the scene.\u201d</p><p>The jackal finally identified the scent. \u201cYou\u2019re...\u201d</p> <p>Stefan sidestepped, casually stomping on the jackal\u2019s foot with his steel-toed work boot. \u201cShe\u2019s point on this case. Come on, Andrea, I\u2019ll show you around.\u201d</p><p>He ducked into the tunnel. I took off my shades, tucked them into a vest pocket, and followed him. A dry stone odor greeted us, mixed with something else. The secondary scent coated my tongue and I recognized it: it was the faint, barely perceptible reek of early decomposition.</p><p>When magic attacked a tall building, it gnawed on the concrete first, attacking it in random places until it turned into dust. Eventually the building crashed like a rotten tree. Concrete and breakable valuables perished, but metal and other valuable scrap endured. Reclamation companies went into the fallen buildings and salvaged the metal and anything else that could be sold.</p><p>Fallen wrecks like this one were unstable. It took a special kind of insanity to burrow into a building that could collapse on your head at any moment. Shapeshifters turned out to be well-suited for it: we were all insane to start with, enhanced strength let us work fast, and Lyc-V-fueled regeneration knitted broken bones together in record time.</p><p>Whatever other faults Raphael had, he made sure to keep the broken bones to a bare minimum. The passageway was six feet wide. Thick steel beams and stone pillars supported the roof and metal mesh held back the walls. I was five foot two, but Stefan had six inches on me, and he didn\u2019t have to duck either. A string of electric lights ran along the ceiling, blinking dimly. Dimly was plenty. We paused, letting our eyes adjust to the gloom, and walked on.</p><p>The tunnel angled down.</p><p>\u201cTell me about the building,\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cIt fell about seven years after the Shift, right in line with the Georgia Power building behind the Civic Center. Before it crashed, it was a thirty-floor tower of blue glass shaped like a V. Built and owned by Jamar Groves. Jamar was a real estate developer and this baby was his pride and joy. He called it the Blue Heron Building. People told him to evacuate, but he got it into his head that the building wouldn\u2019t fall. He\u2019s still here somewhere.\u201d Stefan nodded at the ceiling. \u201cOr at least his bones are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWent down with his ship?\u201d The stench of decomposition was getting stronger, clinging to the walls of the tunnel like a foul patina.</p><p>\u201cYep. Jamar was a weird guy, apparently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly poor people are weird. Rich people are eccentric.\u201d</p><p>Stefan cracked a grin. \u201cWell, Jamar owned a huge art collection and he had some interesting ideas. For one, he had a Roman-style marble bathhouse on the second floor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re after the marble?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cScrew the marble. We\u2019re after the copper plumbing. The whole structure had old-school copper pipes. Copper prices are through the roof right now. Even copper wiring is expensive. Of course, if you smelt the plastic off of it, it\u2019s worth twice as much, but we won\u2019t be doing that. The smoke is toxic as hell, even for us. There is steel, too, but the copper is the real prize. That\u2019s why Raphael bought the building.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe bought the building?\u201d A few months ago when Raphael and I were together, he mostly did work for hire: the owners of various buildings would employ him to reclaim the valuables for a percentage of anything he recovered.</p><p>Stefan grinned. \u201cWe can do that now. Playing with the big boys.\u201d</p><p>The tunnel kept going, lower and lower, burrowing down.</p><p>\u201cWhy dig so deep under the building? Why not come from the side?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Heron is a toppler,\u201d Stefan said. \u201cIt went over right above the sixth floor. And it never caught fire.\u201d</p><p>Magic took buildings down in different ways. Sometimes the entire inner structure collapsed and the building imploded in a fountain of dust. More often, the magic weakened parts of the building, causing a partial collapse until the whole thing crashed, toppling on its side. Topplers were valuable, especially if they didn\u2019t catch fire, because anything underground had a decent chance of surviving.</p><p>\u201cWe were trying to get into the basement,\u201d Stefan confirmed. \u201cThere are fire-suppression and heating systems down there, generators, access to both freight and regular elevator shafts\u2014that\u2019s a lot of metal right there. And you never know, sometimes you can get computer servers out. Stranger things have survived a fallen building. Here we are.\u201d</p><p>Ahead the passageway widened. Stefan flicked the switch and the twin lamps in the ceiling flared into life. We stood in a round chamber, about twenty-five feet wide. Four bodies lay on the dirt floor, two men and two women. At the far wall, a six-foot-tall disk of metal thrust out, revealing a round tunnel filled with darkness\u2014a vault door left ajar.</p><p>\u201cA vault?\u201d</p><p>Stefan grimaced. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t on any of the blueprints and none of the building-related correspondence we had access to mentioned it. We were merrily digging our way up and ran into it last night. We screwed around with the door for about an hour, but we didn\u2019t have the right tools for it, so Raphael posted two guards here and two by the entrance, and we cleared out. A locksmith was supposed to come in this morning and open the sucker. Instead we found this.\u201d</p><p>Four people dead, sprawled in the dirt. Last night they had hugged their loved ones before going on their shift. They had made plans. This morning they were my responsibility. Life was a vicious bitch.</p><p>\u201cOkay, let me see the log.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe crime scene log? The record of who\u2019s been down here and at what time?\u201d</p><p>Stefan gave me a blank look.</p><p>\u201cEh...\u201d</p><p>God damn it. I took a small notebook and a pen out of my vest pocket and kept my voice friendly. \u201cI tell you what, we\u2019ll start one. Here, I\u2019ll be the first.\u201d</p><p>I marked the date at the top of the page and wrote: \u201cAndrea Nash. Time In: 8:12 a.m. Time out: ___________. Purpose: Investigation.\u201d I signed it and passed the notebook and the pen to him.</p><p>\u201cNow you write yourself in. When people come to pick up the bodies, you make them write themselves in, too. We need to keep a record of who comes and goes down here.\u201d</p><p>I set my crime scene bag on the side, opened it, took out gloves and put them on. Next came the Polaroid Instant Digital camera and a stack of paper envelopes for crime scene photos and evidence. Other cameras took better pictures, but magic played havoc with digital data. Sometimes you\u2019d get crystal-clear high-definition images, and sometimes you\u2019d end up with a blurred gray mess or nothing at all. Polaroid Instant Digital cameras produced photos faster than anything else on the market and stored the image digitally as a bonus. It was as close to an instant record of evidence as we could get.</p><p>\u201cHave the bodies been moved at all?\u201d</p><p>Stefan shrugged his shoulders. \u201cSylvia found them, she checked their pulses, examined the vault to see that nobody was there, and backed right out of the dig. We know the drill.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>If they knew the drill, they would\u2019ve kept a log. \u201cWhere is Sylvia now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith Raphael, being hassled by the cops.\u201d</p><p>In legal terms, the Pack had similar rights to a Native American tribe, with the ability to govern itself and enforce its own laws. If a shapeshifter died in the Pack\u2019s territory, it was a Pack matter. These shapeshifters had died within city limits, and the PAD wanted in on the action. They weren\u2019t exactly shapeshifter fans, with a good reason.</p> <p>We lived in the gray zone between beast and human. Those of us who wanted to remain human lived by the Code, a set of strict rules. The Code was all about discipline and moderation and obeying the chain of command. Sometimes the human brakes failed, and a shapeshifter threw the Code out the window and went loup. Loups were sadistic, murderous freaks. They reveled in killing, cannibalism, and every other violent perversity their insane brains could think up. The Pack put them down with extreme prejudice, but that didn\u2019t keep the PAD from viewing every shapeshifter as a potential spree killer. Whenever a shapeshifter murder occurred in the city, they tried to muscle in on it.</p><p>Not that they would accomplish anything. The Pack\u2019s lawyers were ravenous beasts.</p><p>I crouched by the nearest body and aimed the camera. The flash flared, searing the scene with white light for a fraction of a moment. The camera purred, printing out the image. I pulled it out and waved it a bit to dry, before sliding it into a paper envelope.</p><p>The dead man appeared to be in his late fifties. Shapeshifters aged well, so he could\u2019ve been in his seventies, for all I knew. The skin on his forehead was olive, a warm shade particular to those from the Indian subcontinent. That was the only patch of exposed skin left undamaged. Large blisters swelled everywhere else on his cheeks, neck, and arms, the skin peeling up from muscle, stretched taut and completely black.</p><p>Another Polaroid.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like that before,\u201d Stefan said.</p><p>I had. \u201cHas the ME been through here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. But we chased them off.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s right, even if Pack members died outside of the Pack\u2019s territory, the Pack still had the right to claim their bodies. And technically the building was Pack property, since Raphael had bought it. I should\u2019ve remembered that. Getting rusty, Ms. Nash. Getting rusty.</p><p>I handed him the Polaroid camera. \u201cCould you hold on to this for a second?\u201d</p><p>He took the camera. I pulled a knife from my belt and sliced the man\u2019s shirt straight down his chest. The thin fabric parted easily. I made a cut through each sleeve and gently turned the body on its side. A large swelling marked the top of the left shoulder, just above the clavicle. I flicked the knife across the bottom edge of the blister. Body fluids gushed out, black and streaked with blood. The stench hit me instantly, the foul, putrid reek of rotten flesh.</p> <p>Stefan cursed and spun away.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re going to puke, kindly do it in the tunnel.\u201d</p><p>He bent double and shook his head. \u201cNo, I\u2019m good. I\u2019m good.\u201d</p><p>I stretched the deflated skin down. Two ragged punctures marked the man\u2019s back, close to the top of the shoulder near the neck. The swelling had hidden them before.</p><p>\u201cWhat is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA snakebite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t we immune to snake venom?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cNope.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not. Shapeshifters don\u2019t exactly advertise this fact, for obvious reasons, but yeah, a copperhead bites you, you\u2019ll feel it.\u201d</p><p>Stefan blinked at me. \u201cWe regenerate broken bones, and we\u2019re immune to disease and poison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re very resistant to poison but not immune. Remember Erra?\u201d</p><p>Stefan\u2019s eyes darkened. \u201cYeah. I remember.\u201d</p><p>Erra was Kate\u2019s aunt and her secret. Kate\u2019s family was magic, the kind of magic that leveled cities and altered the course of ancient civilizations. Her aunt had slept for thousands of years, but the onset of magic had awakened her, and she came to Atlanta looking for trouble and nearly destroyed the city. One of her creations, which she named Venom, broke into one of Clan Wolf\u2019s houses in the city and poisoned everyone within. They died in agony. It was a wakeup call to the Pack. The shapeshifters could be poisoned, if the poison was strong enough.</p><p>\u201cMost diseases are viral or bacterial in nature,\u201d I said. \u201cLyc-V is a jealous virus, so it terminates these other invaders. Ingested poison is localized to the stomach. The second it tries to enter the bloodstream, Lyc-V will shut it down. A snakebite is another story.\u201d</p><p>I rose, pulled a rag from my pocket, and wiped my hands. \u201cThe snake injects toxins directly into the body, and these toxins are biological: enzymes, coagulants, and so on. Some just attack the area of the bite, but some attack the nervous system, and Lyc-V doesn\u2019t recognize them as a threat until the damage starts to spread.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s this one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHemotoxic. Probably from a viper. The moment the venom enters the victim, it begins to coagulate blood and clot the blood vessels. Lyc-V exists in all tissues, but most of it is in the bloodstream. Clog the arteries and the virus can\u2019t get to the venom fast enough to destroy it. I once knew a werebuffalo who fell into a nest of rattlesnakes. Looked just like that when we pulled his corpse out.\u201d</p><p>Stefan peered at the body. \u201cHow did a snake manage to bite him on his back? He wouldn\u2019t have been lying down in the dirt. Sitting, maybe.\u201d</p><p>Shapeshifters took personal hygiene seriously. \u201cFilthy animal\u201d was a common insult people hurled our way. The guards wouldn\u2019t have been lying down in loose soil unless they absolutely had to.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I took a ruler from my bag and held it up to the bite marks. Three and three-eighths of an inch. Two inches would mean a big snake. Two and a half inches meant a fifteen-foot rattler. Three and three-eighths was crazy.</p><p>\u201cI can tell you that if I was an intelligent snake, this is the place I\u2019d bite,\u201d I said. \u201cIf you cause coagulation in the arteries leading to the brain, death will follow like that.\u201d I would\u2019ve snapped my fingers, but I was wearing latex gloves.</p><p>\u201cSo we have giant super-smart vipers who slithered in here, killed our people, opened the vault, stole something from it, and slithered out, undetected?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAppears so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Just wanted to make sure it wasn\u2019t something dangerous.\u201d</p><p>I flashed him a quick smile and set about processing the scene.</p><p>The scene was a nightmare. Raphael\u2019s workers had been in and out of it barely twelve hours ago and two dozen scent signatures clung to the ground, not to mention the stench of decay rising from the bodies. In the Georgia heat, even this deep underground, corpses decomposed fast.</p><p>A cursory examination of the bodies showed multiple snakebites. I noted four different fang spans and wrote them down. I divided the scene into rows and searched it, wall to wall, picking up every bottle cap and every hair.</p><p>A truck arrived from the Pack to take the bodies back to the Keep, the Pack\u2019s huge headquarters just outside Atlanta that everyone insisted was not a castle, despite it being a dead ringer for one. I jotted down some notes for Doolittle, the Pack\u2019s chief medmage, outlining my snake theory. He would be the one examining the bodies. I packaged the fingerprints I had collected into a large envelope and addressed it to Jim. The Pack had its own fingerprint database, and Jim was in a much better position to identify the prints than I was. I knew the theory behind fingerprint analysis and had been taught some rudimentary skills in the Order\u2019s Academy, but in practice I just saw a bunch of whorls I had no idea what to do with. I also wrote out a quick preliminary assessment for Jim, requested background files on Raphael\u2019s entire workforce, and sent the whole kaboodle to the Keep with the body crew.</p><p>I went into the vault and stood in it for a bit, visually examining the contents. It was filled with antiques. A pair of elegant, long-necked cats, pure black, with eyes of what were probably real emeralds sat against the wall. To the left of the cats, a stone tablet as tall as me rested on the floor, carved with figures in robes and weathered with age. To the right, a small wooden chair, gilded with gold and painted with brown, stood, its feet fashioned into the semblance of lion paws.</p><p>On the shelves were an ornate gold necklace resting in a glass box on top of a scarlet velvet pillow; a set of small bottles, crystal wrapped in bands of gold; a wooden cabinet, empty; a large chunk of sea-foam crystal on black velvet with a carving on it\u2014three men on one side and a woman waving good-bye. Or maybe hello.</p><p>Nope, it was probably good-bye. Life was mean like that.</p><p>Age permeated the scene, emanating from the items like an aroma from a flower. How many people had died for these things? I knew of at least four and I had a feeling the body count would continue to climb.</p><p>I called Stefan down and catalogued the vault, item by item, and had him sign the whole thing as a witness. The list was so long my pen was in death throes by the end of it. Something must have been taken out of the vault, but what? I crawled over every inch of the damn place, looking for any indication of a missing item, but the vault was dust-free. No mysterious outline, no empty hooks, nothing that would give me any sort of clue about what had been taken. For all I knew, instead of taking something out, the attackers had put something in. Wouldn\u2019t that be the pits.</p><p>By the time I finally emerged from the tunnel, covered in dirt and bone tired, the sun had almost completed its escape below the horizon. Scene processing was a slow and tedious job. The next time, I\u2019d find myself someone to slave with me.</p><p>Stefan rose from the steel drum on which he was sitting. \u201cDone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Any news from Raphael?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Either the cops had held him up or he was going to great lengths to avoid me.</p><p>\u201cStefan, that stuff in the vault is very old. We have no way of knowing if any of it is magic or not. You guys need to keep away from it. Don\u2019t touch it, don\u2019t sniff it, don\u2019t try to transport it. I\u2019ll ask someone with magical knowledge to come down with the Keep. They will move it and quarantine it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Stefan squinted at me. \u201cI get what you\u2019re saying, but you\u2019ll have to talk to Raphael about it. He\u2019ll probably come by here after the cops let him go. You want to leave him a note?\u201d</p><p>Good idea. \u201cGot something to write with?\u201d I shook my exhausted pen. \u201cMine is all out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, in the tent.\u201d</p> <p>I glanced at the work tent sitting a few yards away. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>I walked to the tent, pushed the entrance flap aside, and stepped into it.</p><p>It smelled like Raphael.</p><p>His scent permeated every inch of the space, from the tent walls, to the foldout desk and chair, to the papers neatly stacked on the desk. Every object pulsed with it, calling to me, singing, \u201cRaphael...Raphael...Mate...\u201d The scent enveloped me, warm, welcoming, mine, and every inch of me screamed in frustration. I stumbled back out and nearly fell over a rock.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Stefan called.</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d I had to get out of there.</p><p>I turned and marched away.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the note?\u201d Stefan asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll leave a message on his phone.\u201d</p><p>I kept walking, trying to put distance between me and that cursed tent. If someone had barred my way, I might have shot him.</p><p>I stopped by Cutting Edge\u2019s office\u2014it was locked, Kate absent\u2014deposited my trace evidence into our office vault, and drove home. I climbed the stairs, which turned out to be web-free and singed with dark soot from the PAD flamethrowers, and stopped by the Haffeys\u2019 apartment. Nobody answered my knocking. Hopefully Mr. Haffey had made it through.</p> <p>I walked to my apartment, got inside, and leaned against the door, afraid that the world outside would somehow bust in and get me.</p><p>My place was dark and empty. It served as my little haven, especially in the three weeks I had holed up here, trying to come to terms with being thrown out of the Order. It was my safe little prison cell, just me, myself, and I. Well, and Grendel, but the poodle, as good of a listener as he was, couldn\u2019t really hold up his end of the conversation.</p><p>My place didn\u2019t seem safe now. It felt stifling and barren.</p><p>No Raphael. I remembered what it felt like to wake up in the morning and find him holding me. If I closed my eyes, I could hear his laugh. He made me so happy, but more importantly, I made him happy. Whatever my shortcomings were, I knew that I could make his day. I never realized how much joy it brought me. I didn\u2019t have to even do anything. I just had to snuggle up next to him on the couch, while he peered at his business reports, and his face would light up.</p><p>And now he was gone.</p><p>This sucked. This sucked so, so much.</p><p>\u201cThis sucks,\u201d I said, my voice alarmingly loud in the silent room. I knew exactly what I had to do. I had to pick up the phone and call him and tell him how I felt. I should\u2019ve done it weeks ago, but lifting that phone felt like trying to pick up Stone Mountain.</p><p>Our happily ever after ended in one fight and both of us were to blame for it. Back when Erra was rampaging through Atlanta, Kate and I had barely survived a huge fight with one of her creations at the Order. The Order\u2019s office was half burned, half flooded, every window shattered, the walls still smoking. That\u2019s when an emergency call came in from Clan Wolf. They were under attack by Erra too and they were dying. Kate and I wanted to help. Ted, the resident knight-defender, ordered us to stand down. He needed us at the Order.</p> <p>Kate ripped off her Order ID and walked out. I didn\u2019t. I was a knight. I had sworn an oath and I didn\u2019t get to pick which orders I obeyed.</p><p>Raphael took it personally. In his mind I had rejected the shapeshifters, the Pack, and therefore I had rejected him. He was the prince of Atlanta\u2019s boudas, the favorite son, loved, admired, and supported on every turn. To him being a shapeshifter was the most natural thing in the world.</p><p>To me being a shapeshifter meant being hurt, degraded, and living in fear. Every bone in my body had been broken by shapeshifters before I was ten years old. I\u2019ve been stabbed, punched, kicked, whipped, and set on fire. I\u2019ve watched my mother being beaten to a bloody pulp repeatedly and with vicious glee. I had rejected that life and chosen the Order instead. The knights were my pack and Ted was my alpha.</p><p>Raphael knew all this, or most of it. I had told him about my childhood. But to him all that abuse had been inflicted on me by \u201cbad\u201d shapeshifters. The Atlanta Pack consisted of \u201cgood\u201d shapeshifters, with laws, discipline, and safety. He thought they deserved my loyalty above everyone else simply because all of us turned furry. He had expected me to walk away from everything I\u2019d worked so hard for and be his bouda princess. We had an ugly fight and went our separate ways. Neither of us said we were through. We just stopped talking.</p><p>I meant to call him. I had planned to do it after we finally took Erra down, but in that last fight I was injured. My shapeshifter status came out, and the Order cordially requested my presence at its headquarters. It wasn\u2019t the kind of invitation one declined. So I went to stand trial. I thought it was my chance to change the Order for the better. There were other people in the ranks like me, closet shapeshifters, secret not-quite-humans. I wanted to prove that we were worthy of knighthood. I had a stellar record, years of exemplary service, and the decorations and awards to prove it. I thought I had a shot. I had tried, so desperately tried, and in the end it was all for nothing. The Order got rid of me and that was that.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t change the past, but I could work on the present. I was miserable without Raphael. I knew exactly why I hadn\u2019t picked up the phone. Sure, some of it was pride. Some of it was anger. I was tired of everyone judging me. The Order judged me for being a shapeshifter. The shapeshifters judged me for having the wrong kind of father. In a time when my life really sucked, I had needed Raphael to be that one person who didn\u2019t judge me, and I was angry because he did. But deep under it all was fear. As long as I didn\u2019t call him, Raphael couldn\u2019t tell me that we were over.</p><p>How is it that I could run into a gunfight against overwhelming odds and put myself between bullets and civilians, but I couldn\u2019t scrape together enough courage to speak to the one person who mattered the most to me?</p><p>I walked into the kitchen, picked up the phone, and dialed Raphael\u2019s number. We had something, damn it. We loved each other. I missed him. He had to miss me, too. We needed to stop being stupid and sort things out.</p><p>The phone rang.</p><p>He would understand. If he just gave me a chance, I would make him understand all of it.</p><p>Something wet touched my cheek and I realized it was a tear. Jesus Christ. I wiped it off. It was good that I was alone and nobody could see it.</p><p>The answering machine clicked on. Raphael\u2019s voice said, \u201cRaphael Medrano. Leave a message.\u201d</p><p>Keep it together. Keep it professional.</p><p>\u201cHi, it\u2019s me. Jim asked me to look into the murders at your work site. I need to interview you, so I thought maybe we could meet at my office tomorrow morning.\u201d Neutral territory, no memories to get in the way. I hesitated. \u201cI know we didn\u2019t part on the best terms, and I regret that. We both made some mistakes. I hope we can put this aside and try to work together on this investigation.\u201d</p><p>I miss you. I miss you terribly.</p><p>\u201cI would like a chance to clear the air. I...I have some things to tell you that are long overdue. I\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>I hung up.</p><p>It hadn\u2019t sounded right. That wasn\u2019t exactly what I wanted to say. But then again, crying hysterically into the phone and sobbing about how his scent made me want to curl into a fetal position wouldn\u2019t do any good. Sorry and tears had to wait until we met and were alone.</p><p>I could do this right. I just needed to sleep on it.</p><p>CHAPTER 3</p><p>The morning brought light and magic. I took a few extra minutes to decide what to wear. Not that it would make any difference, but I put on my pale blue shirt. It matched my eyes and looked nice. I put on my favorite jeans and looked at myself in the mirror.</p><p>Full-on makeup would be too much. I brushed some mascara on and styled my blond hair, which was doing its best to grow out of its shorter hairdo. Right after I got kicked out of the Order, I\u2019d \u201cfrosted\u201d the tips of my hair blue, but now the dye was all gone and I\u2019d ended up with a head full of highlights instead.</p><p>Like a kid before the prom: gussying up and shaking with nerves. I crossed my arms and glared at myself in the mirror. Sniper, death, kill, tough, hooah. Okay, that was better.</p><p>Raphael always brought out a strange side of me. The wild side, the one that was knitted from pure emotions. That wild Andrea loved him completely and did irrational things, like sitting by the phone with her heart beating too fast, waiting for him to call, or running headfirst into danger against overwhelming odds to fight by his side. That wild Andrea once got arrested. We had gone away for a romantic retreat and while I left the hot tub in the courtyard of the hotel to use the bathroom, some floozy had attached herself to Raphael, not taking no for an answer. When I returned, instead of beating a swift retreat she suggested we should all have fun together. I had dunked her a couple of times. Unfortunately, I was pointing a gun at hotel security at the time, and the sheriff\u2019s deputies showed up. Raphael ate it up. I was finally acting like a mated shapeshifter: irrational, possessive, and head over heels in love.</p><p>I didn\u2019t know if that part of me was my hyena side or just that uncompromising fifteen-year-old girl that lives inside every woman, but now wasn\u2019t the time to let her out. I had to stay rational, so I could apologize and try to mend things between me and Raphael.</p><p>Cutting Edge occupied a sturdy building on the northern edge of Atlanta, about an hour from the Keep. The Beast Lord, also known as Kate\u2019s sugar woogums, had chosen the location, and he pretty much picked the closest place to the Keep that was still within city limits. Curran didn\u2019t like to be without Kate and Kate didn\u2019t like to be without Curran.</p><p>The door was unlocked. Great. I walked in. Ascanio looked up from his broom.</p><p>Despite having very few clients, Cutting Edge had an excess of employees, partially because Kate kept hiring them. According to her, Ascanio Ferara was an intern. In reality nobody with a drop of sense would hire him as an intern or anything else, except maybe as a traffic jam generator. If you stood him on a street corner, sooner or later some female driver would wreck. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Fifteen going on thirty, with glossy black hair and green eyes, Ascanio was beautiful. Not just pretty, not just attractive, beautiful. He had that whole fallen angel thing going\u2014there was a devious, sly mind behind that innocent face and pretty eyes.</p><p>Like most male children of Clan Bouda, he was treasured and babied, more so because he was lost for most of his life and his mother had just found him a few months ago. In this short period he had gotten into every possible trouble imaginable, culminating with being arrested for having a threesome on the courthouse steps. The boy did not understand how the Pack worked, and finally Aunt B foisted him off on Kate. It was that or kill him. Kate\u2019s solution was to make this raging ball of problems and hormones into our intern. How her mind worked, I would never understand. It was a mystery.</p><p>Ascanio snapped to attention and saluted me, holding the broom like a rifle.</p> <p>I pointed at the broom. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>Because it would\u2019ve made every ex-military instructor I ever had foam at the mouth. \u201cYou salute with your weapon as a sign of respect.\u201d</p><p>He presented me with an expression of puzzled innocence. \u201cI don\u2019t have a rifle or a sword. The broom is my weapon.\u201d</p><p>Smartass. \u201cKid, you make my head explode.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAve, Andrea! Ianitori te salutant!\u201d</p><p>Hail, Andrea, those who janitor salute you. Kate was forcing Ascanio and Julie, her ward, to learn Latin, because a lot of historical magical texts were written in it and apparently it was an essential part of their education. Since the lessons were conducted in the office during our copious spare time, I was learning the language along with them.</p><p>I pointed at Ascanio. \u201cNot another word. Latin is a dead language, but that doesn\u2019t mean you get to molest its corpse. Finish sweeping, ianitor.\u201d</p><p>He spun the broom with the dexterity of a Marine on Silent Drill Platoon, planted the handle into the ground, jumped, spinning around it, his legs straight out, and landed on one knee, his head bowed, his right hand extended, holding the broom in his fist parallel to the floor.</p><p>\u201cYou had coffee this morning, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He looked up at me and nodded, a big grin plastered on his face.</p> <p>Teenage boudas. Enough said.</p><p>I sat down and tried my best to concentrate on going through my case. The survey of the evidence only confirmed what I had already realized last night: I didn\u2019t find any smoking guns. Most of what I had picked up looked just like common trash, which didn\u2019t necessarily mean it was trash. It was evidence, the significance of which wasn\u2019t immediately apparent. I catalogued it anyway. Crimes were rarely cracked by the super-brilliant detectives in a blaze of intellectual glory. Most of them were solved by the patient and the meticulous grunts just like me.</p><p>The roar of a water engine\u2013powered vehicle thundered outside of our door and died. Raphael. Had to be. Kate would have parked in the far corner of the parking lot on the side, because she had trouble backing out.</p><p>I pretended to be absorbed in my likely worthless evidence. I had spent the entire drive to the office trying to figure out what to say, how to say it. I wanted to explain why I had done things. I wanted to tell him I loved him. I had tried to prepare myself for the possibility that he would tell me off, but most of me hoped with a desperate naive hope that he would forgive me and we would go home together.</p><p>A knock sounded through our absurdly reinforced door.</p><p>\u201cPericulo tuo ingredere!\u201d Ascanio proclaimed.</p><p>What the hell did he just say? Ingredere...Enter...Enter at your own risk. \u201cIf it\u2019s a client, I\u2019ll shoot you,\u201d I told him.</p><p>The door swung open. A new scent swirled around me, a heavy fragrance\u2014rose, patchouli, and coriander\u2014an expensive perfume. A tall woman stepped inside. She was close to six feet and her shimmering golden heels added another four inches to her height. Her hair, the color of luminous white gold, fell down over her shoulders past her butt. She wore a really short black dress or a long T-shirt, I couldn\u2019t quite decide which. Whatever it was, it was cinched to her improbably narrow waist by a white belt with golden studs. Her face, pretty and painted with makeup to near perfection, had that slightly vapid expression sometimes seen on models: she was either sleepy, horny, or just badly needed to sneeze.</p> <p>A dark figure stepped into the office behind her. Six foot three, lean, wearing a black leather jacket and faded jeans...He stepped into the light. Dark blue eyes looked at me and the world fell apart around us. His face, framed by soft black hair, wasn\u2019t perfect in the way Ascanio\u2019s was, but it was masculine and handsome, and his eyes communicated a kind of sexual intensity, a promise and a challenge, that made women lose all of their self-respect and try to proposition him in plain view of their dates. The familiar scent washed over me like a pain-filled perfume.</p><p>Raphael.</p><p>As if in a dream I saw him put his hand on the woman\u2019s butt, gently pushing her toward the two chairs by my desk.</p><p>Oh sweet Jesus.</p><p>He replaced me.</p><p>He replaced me with a better version of me.</p><p>And he brought her to the office. To rub it in.</p><p>The planet snapped back into place with an agonizing crunch. I stood up, saw myself extend a hand, and heard myself say, \u201cGood morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRebecca.\u201d The woman shook my hand.</p><p>I concentrated so I wouldn\u2019t crush her finger bones into cartilage pancakes.</p><p>\u201cI got your message,\u201d Raphael said.</p><p>And I\u2019ve got yours, loud and clear. Inside me, the other me, the one that grew claws and fangs, howled in helpless fury. She didn\u2019t understand nuances. She understood only that the person who loved her and cared for her had betrayed her and now she hurt. He was mine. Mine! The other me screamed inside me, tearing at the walls to be let out.</p><p>I struggled to keep her in check, imposing logic over emotion. Moving on was one thing. Moving on I could understand. It would break my heart, but I would understand it. This was a giant \u201cfuck you\u201d spelled out in glowing letters.</p><p>I forced my mouth open. My voice sounded flat. \u201cPlease sit down.\u201d</p><p>They sat. Behind them Ascanio stared at us, his jaw hanging down.</p><p>\u201cAscanio, would you mind getting our guests some coffee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlack, please,\u201d Raphael said, his voice pounding a sharp spike into me. \u201cCream and sugar separate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t drink coffee,\u201d Rebecca informed us. \u201cIt stains your teeth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you have any trouble with the cops?\u201d I asked, my control so tight that if I let myself go a hair, I would snap.</p><p>He looked directly at me. \u201cJust minor formalities. Did you have any trouble at the dig site?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone at all. Stefan helped me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a good man, Stefan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he is. Who is your lovely associate?\u201d I unleashed my best smile in Rebecca\u2019s direction. Raphael leaned forward, sliding his left arm along the back of Rebecca\u2019s chair, his body half turned to shield her. He recognized the smile\u2014it was the kind that meant someone was about to get shot.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m his fianc\u00e9e,\u201d Rebecca said.</p><p>Fianc\u00e9e? Fianc\u00e9e.</p><p>Raphael\u2019s eyes widened a fraction. He hadn\u2019t wanted me to know, but it was too late. She had let the cat out of the bag.</p><p>\u201cHow lovely,\u201d I said, sweetness dripping from my voice. \u201cI hadn\u2019t heard the announcement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re engaged to be engaged,\u201d Rebecca said. \u201cWe\u2019re waiting until the end of the physical year to officially announce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean fiscal year?\u201d Dear God, she was a moron.</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s what I meant.\u201d</p><p>Raphael slid his hand over Rebecca\u2019s fingers tipped with hot pink acrylic nails.</p><p>I closed my eyes for a long second. \u201cCongratulations to the happy couple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Rebecca said.</p><p>Raphael toyed with a lock of her hair.</p><p>That did it.</p><p>\u201cI see you\u2019ve upgraded to the deluxe model,\u201d I said. \u201cMust\u2019ve set you back quite a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorth every penny,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou always had expensive tastes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know.\u201d He shrugged his muscular shoulders. \u201cI\u2019ve been known to slum on occasion.\u201d</p><p>I will kill you. I will hurt you, you wretched bastard. \u201cBe careful with that. Sometimes slumming can be dangerous for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can take care of myself,\u201d he said and winked at me.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Rebecca asked.</p><p>\u201cMy car, doll.\u201d Raphael picked up her hand.</p><p>No. No, he wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>He kissed her fingers.</p><p>Every nerve in my body burst on fire.</p><p>\u201cYou seem like such a well-matched couple.\u201d I smiled at them. \u201cPhysically and intellectually. Rebecca is so stunning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget loyal,\u201d Raphael said. \u201cAnd loving.\u201d</p><p>So is a dog. \u201cI\u2019m sure your mother is simply delighted with you both.\u201d</p><p>A muscle in Raphael\u2019s face jerked. My goodness gracious, I\u2019d hit a sore spot. Aunt B, his mother and the head of Clan Bouda, was a legend. Boudas were wild, and she ruled them with sweet smiles and razor-sharp claws. One look at Rebecca and Aunt B would have an instant apoplexy.</p><p>Raphael\u2019s eyebrows furrowed. \u201cMy mother\u2019s approval isn\u2019t necessary.\u201d</p><p>Aha. \u201cDoes she know that?\u201d</p><p>Ascanio approached, carrying a coffee mug on a platter, with a small jar of sugar and a cup of cream.</p><p>\u201cShe is a terrible woman,\u201d Rebecca said.</p><p>Ascanio froze.</p><p>I stared at Raphael. Are you going to let it slide? Honestly? Aunt B was his mother, but she was also his alpha, and Ascanio was a member of the clan.</p><p>Raphael leaned toward Rebecca, his voice intimate but firm like steel wrapped in velvet. \u201cSweetheart, never insult my mother in public.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe insults me. And you don\u2019t do anything about it.\u201d</p><p>Ascanio focused on Raphael, waiting for a cue. Aunt B ruled the clan, but Raphael was the male alpha. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Raphael leveled a warning stare at Rebecca, but it had no effect.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s rude and spiteful\u2014\u201d</p><p>Ascanio picked up the jar of sugar and emptied it over Rebecca\u2019s head. The white powder spilled over her hair and dress.</p> <p>She gasped and jumped off the chair.</p><p>\u201cOh no!\u201d I opened my eyes wide. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. Teenage boys are such a clumsy lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRaf!\u201d</p><p>Raf? What was he, her poodle?</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go outside and wait for me in the car,\u201d Raphael said.</p> <p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo outside, Rebecca.\u201d</p><p>She marched out of the office, pouting. Raphael\u2019s eyes sparked with a deep ruby glow. He looked at Ascanio, as if deciding what he should do about him. The boy ducked his head and said nothing, his gaze firmly affixed to the floor.</p><p>Ascanio was a talented young shapeshifter, but I had fought beside Raphael. He could go through a room full of Ascanios in seconds and leave none of them alive.</p><p>\u201cAscanio,\u201d I sunk so much quiet menace into the word, the boy froze, as if petrified. \u201cDid your alpha look like he needed help?\u201d</p><p>Ascanio\u2019s voice was clipped. \u201cNo, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGo outside and wait until I come to get you.\u201d</p><p>Ascanio opened his mouth.</p><p>\u201cOutside. Stay in the back lot. Don\u2019t speak to Rebecca.\u201d</p><p>He clamped his jaw shut and took off. A moment later the back door closed.</p><p>Raphael had shattered my heart into tiny little shards and they were hurting me. Never in all of our time together had he so much as mentioned engagement. And now he had found a pretty, empty-headed idiot and he was going to marry her. Why her? What was she giving him that I hadn\u2019t?</p><p>The answer came to me in a painful burst. She was there for him. I hadn\u2019t been. I\u2019d shut him out. I\u2019d thought he would wait while I sorted myself out. My own damn fault.</p><p>I leaned forward, my voice steady. \u201cAre you high?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid you smoke something before you decided it was a good idea to flaunt her in front of me? Maybe you ate some weird-looking mushrooms?\u201d</p><p>He smiled at me. It was a brilliant Raphael grin, sharp like the edge of his knives.</p><p>\u201cYou know I could kill her before you could stop me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo danger of that,\u201d he said. \u201cThat would mean you\u2019d act like a shapeshifter and we all know that\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d</p><p>Ouch. \u201cMy memory must be malfunctioning. I don\u2019t remember your being this cruel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople change,\u201d he said. \u201cDid you expect everyone to pause their lives while you were having your little pity party? Was I supposed to sit there and wait like a good boy, until you were \u2018in a good place\u2019?\u201d</p><p>It hurt so much, I was beginning to go numb. \u201cI didn\u2019t bar my door. My phone still worked. If you wanted to get in touch, you could have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease! You think I have no pride? I loved you, I cared for you, I offered you a place in the Pack beside me, and you betrayed everything that was important to me. How did that turn out for you, Andrea? Was it worth it?\u201d</p><p>I winced. \u201cNo. It wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy door wasn\u2019t barred either.\u201d</p><p>He had saved it all up since the night we\u2019d fought. Now everything was coming out.</p><p>\u201cYou betrayed me, you let the Order treat you like shit, and then you hid in your apartment. That wasn\u2019t the Andrea I knew. I thought I could count on you. I thought you had my back.\u201d His face was a furious mask. \u201cI would\u2019ve done anything for you.\u201d</p><p>I would have done anything for him, too. If it had been him in that Wolf House, I would\u2019ve run there so fast, the entire Order wouldn\u2019t have been able to stop me. My other self was howling in my ears, loud, so, so loud...</p><p>\u201cYou spat on everything I am. You picked the knights over my people, which means you picked your precious Order over me.\u201d</p><p>I was shaking, straining to contain myself. My body struggled to counteract the stress, betraying me.</p><p>\u201cAnything to say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo little, too late. I\u2019m tired of waiting for you to stop running away from who you are. You want to know what the best thing about Rebecca is?\u201d</p><p>His eyes were pure ruby and they burned. I was hanging on by a thread.</p><p>\u201cShe isn\u2019t you.\u201d</p><p>My humanity tore and the other me spilled out.</p><p>Raphael stared at me, suddenly silent.</p><p>The shreds of my clothes fluttered around me. I had this curious feeling that I was watching it all from some point above my head. My arms still rested on the table, but now soft sandy fur with a scattering of brown spots covered the hard muscle. I knew what my face looked like: a meld of human and hyena, with a dark muzzle and my blue, human eyes above it.</p><p>Most shapeshifters had two shapes, human and animal. The more talented of us could maintain a warrior form, halfway between animal and beast. I didn\u2019t have an animal form. There were only two choices: my human self and my other me, neither human nor hyena, but an odd creature in between. I was beastkin. My father had started his life as a hyena, caught the Lyc-V virus, and turned into a human. For that, other shapeshifters hated me and some tried to kill me on sight.</p><p>I examined myself sitting there. I\u2019d held back for so long. I\u2019d been good for so long. I always did as expected. I followed rules and regulations. Look where it got me. Being good hurt.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean that,\u201d Raphael said.</p><p>Why had I wasted all my time pretending to be someone I wasn\u2019t? I was tired, so very, very tired of standing on my own brakes. I felt...right. I felt free. I hadn\u2019t felt like this since I\u2019d lost control and slapped Aunt B. She had backhanded me right down two flights of stairs, but it was worth it. It was so worth it.</p><p>What did I have to lose anyway?</p><p>I took a deep breath and let the old good Andrea go. Magic coursed through me, making me stronger, sharper. Scents filled my nose, stole through my mouth, and expanded my lungs.</p><p>\u201cAndrea?\u201d</p><p>I tilted my head and looked at him. He\u2019d brought another woman into my office. Whatever made him think I would stand for that?</p><p>I opened my mouth and showed him my sharp teeth. Most shapeshifters couldn\u2019t speak in a half form, but then I wasn\u2019t most shapeshifters.</p><p>\u201cYou meant every word. I told you I was sorry. I took responsibility for my actions. It is over now.\u201d</p><p>My voice was deeper, permeated with the rough notes of a growl.</p><p>\u201cThis office is my territory. If you bring your woman here again, I\u2019ll consider it a challenge.\u201d</p><p>He leaned forward, inhaling my scent. His upper lip trembled, betraying a flash of his teeth. \u201cBeen studying the Pack\u2019s Law?\u201d</p><p>I laughed and heard an eerie hyena cackle in my voice. \u201cI don\u2019t have to study. I know all the laws.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you know you can\u2019t attack a human.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho said anything about attacking a human? If you bring her here again, it will be your fault. I\u2019ll beat your ass and not even your mommy will be able to stop me.\u201d</p><p>Raphael leaned closer, his eyes glowing. \u201cPromises, promises, honey.\u201d</p><p>I snapped my teeth at him. \u201cI\u2019m not your honey. Your honey is out in the parking lot.\u201d</p><p>The beginnings of a snarl reverberated in his throat, but his eyes were puzzled. He wasn\u2019t sure what to make of me.</p><p>I wanted to bite something. I wanted to rend and carve things with my claws and get rid of my hurt. I wanted him to leave. But if he left, we would have to do it again. I still had a job to do. This sonovabitch would not keep me from it. I would get the information I needed and I would not let him bother me any further.</p><p>I picked up the pen with my clawed hand. \u201cI find your scent disturbing. Let\u2019s finish this up so I can air the place out and get you and your girl candy out of my life. The Blue Heron building. How did you buy it?\u201d</p><p>He stared at me.</p><p>\u201cWe have four dead people. Your people. Do try to keep up.\u201d</p><p>Raphael leaned back, studying me. \u201cIt was a sealed bid auction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere there any other buyers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. It was a very valuable building.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know who they were?\u201d A sealed bid auction meant that each of the participants submitted a confidential bid for the building, but Raphael would\u2019ve done his homework and researched other buyers to know how much to bid against them.</p><p>\u201cI can give you the top three,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m all ears.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBell Recovery. Kyle Bell has been in the business for a long time. He does decent work, but he\u2019s expensive and slow. I can usually underbid him.\u201d</p><p>I wrote it down. \u201cWhat\u2019s your relationship with him?\u201d</p><p>Raphael shrugged. \u201cWe don\u2019t like each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas he bitter that you outbid him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKyle exists in a state of bitter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn your opinion, would he stoop to murder?\u201d</p><p>Raphael shook his head. \u201cNo. Kyle makes a lot of noise and stomps around. He might get his people to rough someone up, but he wouldn\u2019t get into anything that required outside help, like magic snakes. He doesn\u2019t trust anyone.\u201d</p><p>So Stefan had already told him about my visit. \u201cGot it. Next.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen there is Jack Anapa of Input Enterprises.\u201d Raphael leaned forward, resting his forearm on the table. His scent was scraping against me like fine-grain sandpaper. \u201cAnapa is an ass. He has mountains of money and he plays with it.\u201d</p><p>I squinted at him. \u201cDon\u2019t like him much?\u201d</p><p>Raphael grimaced. \u201cHe dabbles. He dabbled in construction, he dabbled in shipping, now he\u2019s dabbling in reclamation. He\u2019ll get bored and move on; for him it\u2019s a game. For us it\u2019s business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas he upset at losing the bid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cInitially he won it, but his permits weren\u2019t filed properly, so they went to me as the second-highest bidder. A skyscraper has a lot of mercury. It\u2019s in the thermostats. When a building crashes, mercury drips to the bottom. Before you can reclaim a building, you have to prove to the city\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat you\u2019re qualified to safely remove it,\u201d I finished. \u201cI remember.\u201d I was with Raphael once when he filed for permits. \u201cWould you say Anapa is capable of murder?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. But I don\u2019t think he\u2019d murder my people. He doesn\u2019t seem to have the motivation. I was there when he lost the bid. He was looking over some papers his assistant shoved under his nose. He waved his hand and said, \u2018Yes, yes. C\u2019est la vie.\u2019 Oh, and he invited me to his birthday bash before he left.\u201d</p><p>Interesting. \u201cThe third bidder?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGarcia Construction. I\u2019ve known the Garcias for a long time. They were in business for about ten years before I started. It\u2019s a family-operated business. They mostly took medium-sized reclamation jobs and didn\u2019t get very ambitious until about two years ago, when Ellis took over the company from his father. They went big real fast, too fast, and bought rights to a huge apartment complex.\u201d Raphael grimaced again. \u201cIt was a monster of a building. I wouldn\u2019t have taken it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo expensive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot too expensive to buy, but too expensive to reclaim. The way it fell, you\u2019d have to shift a ton of rubble before you got to anything decent. Too many man-hours. Ellis started it that May and last February the Garcias were still digging in it when a section of it collapsed. Killed seven workers. Apparently Ellis had sunk all his resources into the building and let the insurance lapse. The insurance companies hate us. The premiums are through the roof. The Garcias did the right thing and paid out the death benefits anyway, out of their own pocket. The company was finished after that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo how can they afford to bid on Blue Heron?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cWord is, they got a substantial investment. This was their comeback attempt. They are decent, hardworking people, Andrea. They wouldn\u2019t kill my crew.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSomebody did, Raphael. What about the seller?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe city of Atlanta.\u201d</p><p>That was a dead end for sure. \u201cDid you know about the vault?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He scowled. \u201cRianna, one of the guards, just had her baby three months ago. It was her second day back on the job. Nick is her husband. You remember Nick Moreau?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNick the carpenter? The one that redid our, no, I\u2019m sorry, your kitchen?\u201d</p><p>Raphael nodded. \u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>I remembered Nick. He\u2019d cracked jokes while he had installed the cabinets and showed me a picture of his wife and told me she was the most wonderful woman on Earth. He\u2019d said they were trying to have a baby and if it was a boy, they would name him Rory, and if it was a girl, they would name her Rory, too.</p><p>Raphael had teased him that they were setting the baby up to be made fun of, to which Nick had pointed his hammer at Raphael and told him that if he wanted to name babies, he would just have to make some of his own.</p><p>\u201cWas it a girl?\u201d I asked quietly. \u201cBaby Rory?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a boy,\u201d Raphael said.</p><p>And now his mother was dead. I would get those bastards. I would find them and make them pay.</p><p>I got up. \u201cThank you for your cooperation. We\u2019re done. I\u2019ll inform you when I have a lead.\u201d This interview is over. Get the hell out of my office and out of my life.</p><p>\u201cDo that.\u201d</p><p>Raphael rose and left.</p> <p>Work was the only thing I had left. Everything else was gone now. I would find the murderers. I would find them if it was the last thing I did. I had to do it to prevent them from killing anyone else, to offer their victims vengeance and solace, and most of all I had to do it to prove to myself that I was still worth something.</p><p>I pulled out a phone book and tracked down the three addresses of the bidders.</p><p>His scent was still here. I snarled at it, but it refused to vanish.</p><p>Hurt and frustration bubbled in me. I was keyed up too high, my skin was on too tight, and I wanted to shoot something just to vent all the pain boiling up inside.</p><p>So Raphael had replaced me with a seven-foot-tall dimwit, so what? Good riddance. I was better off on my own.</p><p>The back door opened with a faint creak. Ascanio walked into the office and froze.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He opened his mouth, his eyes wide.</p><p>\u201cSpeak!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBreasts,\u201d he said.</p><p>Female shapeshifters didn\u2019t have breasts in warrior form. There was no need for them. They were either flat-chested or sported rows of teats. I had breasts. They were covered with fur, but they were recognizable adult female boobs.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your first time seeing a pair, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm. No.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen do act like you\u2019ve been around the block before.\u201d</p><p>Ascanio closed his mouth with a click.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t test Raphael,\u201d I told him. \u201cIf you do, he\u2019ll cut you into itsy-bitsy pieces and leave them in a pretty pile on the floor.\u201d I decided I liked my beastkin voice. It was deeper, more powerful, and sounded better. In an attractive female monster kind of way.</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know.\u201d He gave me a look suffused with teenage arrogance. \u201cI think he might find it difficult.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he won\u2019t. We once fought a dog the size of a two-story house. Raphael ripped one of its heads off.\u201d</p><p>Ascanio blinked. \u201cOne?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt had three.\u201d I got up and pulled a change of clothes from my bag. My other me was about twenty-five percent larger, but my long-sleeved T-shirt had a lot of stretch in it. I pulled it on and put on my pants. They were more like capris now and they were tight on my calves. \u201cI\u2019m going out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike that?\u201d</p><p>I pulled out my knife and sliced the hems of my pants. Much better. \u201cWho\u2019s going to stop me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re...not in human shape.\u201d</p><p>Yes, and I was sick of being ashamed of who I was. I looked at him for a long moment. \u201cIf I change back into a human, I\u2019ll need a nap. I don\u2019t have time for naps. If someone has a problem with the way I look, fuck them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUhh...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd stop looking so scandalized. I covered my boobs, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I still know they\u2019re there. I saw them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTreasure the memory.\u201d I grabbed my bag off the table.</p><p>Ascanio jumped in front of the door. \u201cCan I come with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He fluttered his eyelashes at me. \u201cI\u2019ll be very quiet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAndrea, I\u2019m sick of being stuck here by myself. Please, please, please, can I come with you? I\u2019ll be good.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d been cooped up in the office for the last few weeks, at first because he was injured, then because he wasn\u2019t and we wanted to keep him that way.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to look for a murderer. If you come with me, you\u2019ll get hurt when we run into trouble on the way. And then I will have to have a very unpleasant conversation with Aunt B, which will go like this: \u2018You won\u2019t join Clan Bouda, you broke up with my son, and you let that sweet precious boy get hurt.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Ascanio picked up my desk with one hand and held it four feet off the ground.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your muscle I\u2019m concerned about. It\u2019s your brains. Or lack thereof.\u201d</p><p>He set the table down. \u201cPlease, Andrea.\u201d</p><p>He was going stir-crazy and doing broom drills. I could relate. I\u2019d been there.</p><p>\u201cCan you drive?\u201d If I put my seat all the way back, I\u2019d fit into the Jeep, but driving with my size-twelve feet and three-inch claws would be a challenge.</p><p>\u201cDo the People navigate vampires? Of course I can drive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d</p><p>He jumped three feet in the air.</p><p>\u201cNow, while you\u2019re with me, you will be acting as a representative of our firm. That means you will be respectful and polite. If some jerk calls you an asshole, you\u2019ll call him sir. Even if you have to throw him on the ground and break his legs, you will still call him sir while doing it. You follow my lead and you follow my orders. That means not taking the initiative and starting fights without my express command. Do you get me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent. Go get your knife.\u201d</p><p>He ran into the supply room and came out with a tactical bowie knife in a sheath on his belt. The bowie, a \u201cMercenary Guild\u201d model, boasted a sixteen-inch black blade and weighed almost two pounds. You could chop small trees down with it. It would be sufficient.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>He hesitated. \u201cCarrie and Deb are in our parking lot. I saw them from the window.\u201d</p><p>I went to the back and carefully glanced out of the window. Two boudas waited for us by my Jeep. The one on the left, Carrie, a tall Italian-looking woman in her mid-forties with dark shoulder-length hair, leaned against the vehicle, her hands in the pockets of her jeans. Olive-skinned, Carrie had a kind of raw-boned hardness about her that said you\u2019d have to rip her arms off before she\u2019d stop coming after you. Deb, her buddy, was about ten years younger, looked softer, rounder in the face, and stood two inches shorter. Her red hair, cut in a fluffy carefree bob, flared about her tan face. Her brown eyes brimmed with humor. She cracked up easily and usually went for the gut in a fight.</p><p>Aunt B used them for light enforcement jobs. That old bitch was at it again. Aunt B and I never saw eye to eye. She\u2019d helped me once during the flare, when the magic made me lose control over my body, but that was the only moment of kindness I had ever seen from her.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you two doing here?\u201d I murmured to myself.</p><p>\u201cMaybe they have some pamphlets that will save our souls and make sure we\u2019re right with the Lord,\u201d Ascanio said.</p><p>\u201cDid those nice church ladies come by again?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI asked them if a man died and then the woman remarried, and the three of them met in heaven, would it be a sin for them to have a threesome, since they were all married in God\u2019s eyes. And then they decided they were late to be somewhere else.\u201d</p><p>A little bit of knowledge was a very dangerous thing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>In the parking lot, Deb crossed her arms and kicked a tiny rock. It flew out of our view like it had been shot from a cannon. Deb watched it go, winced, and hid behind the Jeep. Carrie shook her head.</p><p>Any shapeshifter in the Pack\u2019s territory had three days to present themselves to the Pack, at which point they would either obtain a visitor\u2019s permit, allowing them to carry out their business; they would petition to join the Pack; or they would be asked to leave. While I was in the Order, Aunt B made no move to bring me into the fold. I thought she didn\u2019t want to cause a problem with the knights. I discovered I was wrong\u2014she left me alone because Raphael had a thing for me and then we became an item. The moment we had a falling out, she came after me like a shark.</p><p>Aunt B wanted me to play ball, join Clan Bouda, and be one of her girls. I\u2019d been in a bouda clan once. No thanks.</p> <p>\u201cWe could go out the front door,\u201d Ascanio said.</p><p>They thought they could intimidate me. Well, they should have brought a lot more people, because I was done doing things by the book. \u201cHell, no. We\u2019re going out the back. Whatever happens, you stay out of it or I will never take you with me anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>I marched out through the back door.</p><p>The boudas took me in, fur and all. Their eyes widened.</p> <p>\u201cWhere the hell do you think you\u2019re going like that?\u201d Carrie asked.</p><p>Wrong thing to say. Wrong, wrong thing to say. \u201cWherever the hell I please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t get it.\u201d Carrie shook her head. \u201cAre you trying to provoke Aunt B? What, your life\u2019s too nice and you need some misery?\u201d</p><p>I grinned at them. See the teeth? Take note, you\u2019ll see them up close if you\u2019re not careful. \u201cCan I help you, ladies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Carrie said. \u201cYou can tell us what the meeting between you and Raphael was about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why would I do that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause Aunt B wants to know,\u201d Deb said.</p><p>They must\u2019ve tried to listen in, but before Kate got this office, the same Jim who put me on this case had remodeled it. I didn\u2019t know what he put into the walls, but the place was shapeshifter soundproof.</p><p>\u201cAunt B\u2019s tailing her own son now?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s none of your business,\u201d Carrie said. \u201cLook, we can go with Plan A, where we all have a nice chat and go our separate ways, or we can do Plan B, where we have a more vigorous chat and tune you up a bit until you feel like sharing. Either way, Aunt B will get what she wants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about Plan C?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat plan would that be?\u201d Deb asked.</p><p>\u201cThe one where you go fuck yourselves.\u201d A snarl crept into my voice. \u201cYou come here to my territory and you think you can push me around? Well, come on. Push. See what it will get you.\u201d</p><p>Deb blinked.</p> <p>\u201cFuck you, you stupid bitch,\u201d Carrie growled. \u201cYou want a lesson, I\u2019ll give you one.\u201d</p><p>Carrie\u2019s body flowed, snapping into a new shape: half-person, half-animal, wrapped in sparse, sandy fur. Thick ropes of muscle corded her massive neck, supporting her round head with giant jaws and a forest of sharp fangs soaked in drool. The muscle continued to knot between her shoulder blades, forming a hump. Colossal biceps powered her arms, the network of veins bulging through her hide. Her feet and hands bore three-inch claws that would shred flesh like a knife cut through a ripe fruit. She looked like the stuff nightmares were made of. If you didn\u2019t know any better.</p><p>I took a couple of steps forward, so I\u2019d have plenty of room to maneuver. My furry me was proportionate: my limbs were properly formed, my jaws fit together into a neat muzzle, and although my hands and feet were oversized and armed with claws, my fingers weren\u2019t misshapen. Maintaining this form came effortlessly to me. But Carrie was a regular shapeshifter and her warrior form was on the shaky side. Her jumbo biceps bulged from her too-long arms, limiting her movement, while her short legs barely had enough meat to support her top-heavy frame. She hunched over, because her spine fit into her pelvis at an angle, and no effective kicks would be coming my way. She didn\u2019t specialize in combat, which meant she\u2019d fight just like any other civilian shapeshifter: claws, teeth, nothing fancy. Good enough to tear most normal humans into pieces.</p><p>Next to her Deb raised her arms. No warrior form, but she was good at boxing.</p><p>Carrie\u2019s eyes stared at me, shining with ruby light. She outweighed me by a hundred pounds. She thought the fight was in the bag.</p><p>Inside my head, Michelle\u2019s squeaky voice mocked from the depth of my memories, \u201cHit her again, Candy. Hit that beastkin bitch. She deserves it.\u201d</p><p>Never again.</p><p>Carrie charged me. She thundered across the pavement and lunged at me, swiping with her right arm diagonally and down, trying to gash my chest open. I leaned back. Her claws sliced through the air, an inch from my chest. I caught her wrist, yanked her massive arm straight and smashed the heel of my hand into the back of her elbow. The cartilage crunched, the joint popped, dislocated, and her arm bent the wrong way, its elbow inside out. Carrie howled and dropped to one knee, her right leg bent, her left almost flat on the ground. I stomped on that weak calf. I sank all the power of my hip and butt muscle into it. Like getting hit with a jackhammer. The leg didn\u2019t stand a chance. Carrie screamed as the bone broke.</p><p>Deb bladed her body, standing sideways, trying to present less of a target. Her hands were up, curled into fists.</p><p>I took a step, spun, and hammered a roundhouse to the back of her thigh. My shin smashed into her leg. Her knee bent, her thigh suddenly powerless. She gasped, dropping her guard, and I turned, swinging into the punch, and landed a haymaker to the side of her head.</p><p>The blow took her off her feet. She flew, rolling, and smashed into the stone wall bordering the parking lot.</p><p>That\u2019s right. No shapeshifter would ever beat on me again while I curled into a ball on the ground. Especially not a bouda.</p><p>Carrie sprawled facedown on the pavement, out cold. The pain must\u2019ve been too much and Lyc-V had shut her down while it made repairs. Deb moaned weakly by the wall. Ascanio still stood by the door, his eyes opened wide, his face glazed over with shock and something suspiciously resembling admiration.</p><p>I walked over to Deb, grabbed her hair, and pulled her face up. She stared at me, her eyes terrified.</p><p>\u201cNow you listen to me,\u201d I said. \u201cYou tell the clan that I\u2019ll come to see Aunt B when I\u2019m damn good and ready. And if I catch any of you at my place of business or near my apartment, you will regret it.\u201d</p><p>I let go of her and straightened. \u201cAscanio! I need that motor running.\u201d</p><p>He ran to the Jeep and began to chant. Fifteen minutes later we drove out of the parking lot. As we turned, I saw Deb pick herself up and stagger over to Carrie. For better or worse, she would deliver my message. I was sure of it.</p><p>CHAPTER 4</p><p>Bell Recovery was headquartered in a sturdy brick building on the edge of a large industrial yard on the southwest side of Atlanta, all ugly ruins surrounded by bright green growth. Nature waged a relentless assault on the city. People burned it and cut it, and still it came back, fed by magic and growing faster than ever.</p><p>Ascanio parked and didn\u2019t bother shutting off the engine. It would take too much chanting to start it back up and considering the Pack\u2019s paw stenciled on its door and the fact that I exited it flashing my claws and teeth, there wouldn\u2019t be anyone dumb enough to try to steal it.</p><p>Ascanio and I marched through the front doors.</p><p>A harried receptionist raised her head from the papers on her desk and jumped a little in her seat. She was middle-aged and her hair had been dyed an unnaturally red color.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d I said, smiling.</p><p>She pushed her chair as far back as it would go.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here on behalf of the Pack to chat with Kyle Bell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s on site,\u201d the receptionist said. Her eyes told me she would answer any question just to get us out of her office.</p><p>\u201cWhere would that be?\u201d</p><p>She swallowed. \u201cThe east end of Inman Yard.\u201d</p><p>You don\u2019t say. \u201cAt the Glass Menagerie?\u201d</p><p>The receptionist nodded. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for your cooperation, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>We headed back out to our Jeep.</p><p>\u201cKyle Bell is either really ballsy or really stupid. Probably both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Ascanio asked.</p><p>\u201cBecause doing any sort of reclamation at the Glass Menagerie is suicidal. Especially with the magic up. It\u2019s also illegal. And now we have to drive through the Burnout to get there. I hate the Burnout. It\u2019s depressing.\u201d</p><p>We got back into our Jeep.</p><p>\u201cTake the right, then another right. We need to get on Hollowell Parkway and make a left there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the Glass Menagerie?\u201d Ascanio asked, steering the Jeep out of the parking lot.</p><p>As far as I knew the Glass Menagerie was off-limits to adventurous Pack persons below eighteen. For a good reason, too. \u201cYou\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>As the road climbed north, the landscape changed. The ruins of warehouses and the greenery remained behind. Around us old husks of burned-out houses crouched, accented by an occasional spot of green.</p><p>Being stuck holding the fort at the Order left me with a lot of free time, so I had read guidebooks and familiarized myself with the city maps. In my spare time I\u2019d jogged through random Atlanta neighborhoods on the off chance I might have to visit them in my professional capacity. My guidebooks mentioned that years ago a devastating fire had swept through the western section of Atlanta, taking out the older residential neighborhoods north of 402. The fire had burned with an intense, unnatural orange and raged for almost a week despite heavy rains and many attempts to put it out. When it was finally over, the land had lost its ability to support plant life. In other parts of Atlanta, any spot of clear ground was immediately claimed by vegetation that grew like it was on steroids. The Burnout remained weed-free for a decade. The plants were finally coming back\u2014kudzu draped a crumbling wall here and there and bright yellow dandelions and crimson bloody dandies, the dandelion\u2019s magic-altered cousins, poked out between the fallen bricks. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A few months ago, during Indian summer, Raphael and I had a picnic under a giant oak in a field outside the city. I had always wanted to have one of those movie picnics with a red-and-white checkered cloth and a wicker basket. We ate take-out fried chicken, washed it down with root beer and cream soda, and lay about on our tablecloth. I had picked a bunch of dandelions and bloody dandies and made two flower crowns.</p><p>It seemed so stupid now. What the hell did I do that for? Like some besotted silly ten-year-old.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just fight Rebecca?\u201d Ascanio asked. \u201cYou\u2019d win.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course I would win. Even if she spat frag grenades and sweated bullets, I\u2019d win. She\u2019s a human. I\u2019m a shapeshifter with ten years of combat experience and some of the best martial education you can get.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn nature you have to fight off your competition.\u201d</p><p>In nature, huh? I\u2019d heard that one before. \u201cIn nature, hyena cubs are born with open eyes and a full set of teeth. They start fighting from the moment they come out of their mother. They dig tunnels in the den, too small for adults to get through, and they fight there. About a quarter of them don\u2019t grow up. So if this was nature and you were a twin, you\u2019d have to murder your newborn sister or brother. Should we dump all of the bouda babies into a playpen and let them starve until they start killing each other?\u201d</p><p>Ascanio frowned. \u201cWell, no...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? It\u2019s natural selection. Just like nature.\u201d I wrinkled my nose. \u201cBoudas love this argument, because it gives them an excuse to do all the wrong things. \u2018I\u2019m sorry I screwed your sister and got my penis stuck in your German shepherd. It\u2019s in my nature. I just couldn\u2019t help myself.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Ascanio snorted.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be that guy,\u201d I told him. \u201cIt\u2019s bullshit reasoning. We are not animals. We are people. And a good thing too, because it wasn\u2019t hyenas who conquered the world. And yes, I know it\u2019s ironic as hell, given that I\u2019m all fur and claws right this second, but the human part of me is still in the driver\u2019s seat. We all know what happens when the animal side starts running the show.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe go loup,\u201d Ascanio said.</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>Loupism was a constant threat. It claimed fifteen percent of shapeshifter children, some at birth, some in adolescence, forcing the Pack to humanely terminate them. For boudas, the number was even higher\u2014almost a quarter. Both of Raphael\u2019s brothers had gone loup and Aunt B had had to kill them. That\u2019s why any surviving adolescent in the bouda clan was treated like a treasure.</p><p>If I ever had babies with Ra...The thought twisted in me like a knife in the wound. There would be no little bouda babies. No Raphael. That door slammed shut and I needed to put him out of my mind. In this life you\u2019re lucky if you get one shot at happiness, and I had missed mine. The fact that it was a joint screwup just hurt more.</p> <p>Water under the bridge.</p><p>\u201cBut she is stupid,\u201d Ascanio said. \u201cShe insulted Aunt B!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd for that we should rip her throat out?\u201d I glanced at him.</p><p>\u201cWell, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuppose I did beat the snot out of her. What would it accomplish? In nature animals fight to demonstrate superiority. The more powerful you are, the better your genetic material is. Stronger animal, stronger babies, a better chance of survival for the species. Raphael already knows I\u2019m a better fighter and he chose her over me anyway. That\u2019s a lesson for you\u2014when you get a chance to be happy, you take it and you treat the other person the way they deserve to be treated. Don\u2019t take things for granted.\u201d</p><p>Giving advice was easy. Living by it was much harder.</p><p>We took a right at the fork, heading farther north. The charred houses continued. To the right, a large sign nailed to an old telephone post shouted DANGER in huge red letters. Underneath in crisp black letters was written:</p><p>IM-1: Infectious Magic Area</p> <p>Do Not Enter</p><p>Authorized Personnel Only</p><p>A second smaller sign under the first one, written on a piece of plastic with permanent marker, read:</p><p>Keep out, stupid.</p><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t going to keep out, are we?\u201d Ascanio asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwesome.\u201d</p><p>We rolled by another blackened home. To the left a large blue-green shard protruded from the ground at an angle. To the right, by the metal carcass of a fire-stripped truck, another sliver, pale blue, waited to bloody someone\u2019s ankle. The first signs of the Menagerie.</p><p>Here and there more shards punctured the soil, and in the distance, far to the right, a jagged iceberg rose at a steep angle twenty feet high, glowing with translucent green and blue in the morning sun.</p><p>Ascanio squinted. \u201cWhat is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlass,\u201d I answered.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere did it come from?\u201d</p><p>Ahead more icebergs crowded in, forming a glacier. \u201cSome of it is from Hollowell Station. Before the Shift, Inman Yard used to be Norfolk Southern\u2019s train yard. It was huge. Over sixty-five tracks in the bowl alone. Not only that, but CSX\u2019s Tilford train yard was right next to it. Together they handled over a hundred trains per day. Then they built the Hollowell Station. It was supposed to be a new, super-modern terminal and most of it was glass. Guess what happened when the magic waves started hitting?\u201d</p><p>Ascanio grinned. \u201cIt crashed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it did. There were hills of glass everywhere. The magic waves kept causing train crashes, but the railroad hung in there. Over the next few months some railroad employees started to get the idea that the glass hills were multiplying. Nobody else paid much attention to it. Then during the second flare, creatures popped out of the glass and killed half of the railroad workers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of creatures?\u201d Raphael asked.</p><p>\u201cNobody knows.\u201d</p><p>Flares\u2014intense, terrible magic waves\u2014came once every seven years. Things that were impossible during normal magic waves became reality during a flare. The flare\u2019s magic held for three days straight and then disappeared for a long while, but its consequences were often deadly.</p><p>\u201cEventually the military came back to reclaim the yard. There were roughly two hundred trains in there, and some of them were full of goods. The soldiers found that the glass had expanded and encased the trains. When they tried to chip it off, they were attacked by creatures. Nobody ever figured out what the creatures were, but they caused multiple casualties. Finally the MSDU gave up and cordoned off the Inman Yard with barbed wire. The glass never stopped growing. Helicopters were still flying once in a while back then, so one of the reporters looked at the place from above and dubbed it the Glass Menagerie.\u201d</p><p>Ahead two glass icebergs met above the road, fused into a massive arch. We passed under it and into the labyrinth of glass. Peaks of green, blue, and white towered above us, some connected, some standing apart, some curving, others perfectly sheer. The light turned turquoise, as if we were underwater. The glass cliffs crowded the crumbling road, painting the ground with colored shadows.</p><p>The back of my head itched, the nerves prickling, as if some invisible sniper had sighted me from the scope of his rifle. Someone was watching us from the icy depths. Ascanio fell silent, focused and tense. He\u2019d sensed it, too.</p><p>The road in front of us glittered.</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d I said.</p><p>The Jeep came to a stop.</p><p>A sheer ridge of glass crossed the road. A few yards before it reached the asphalt, it had shattered into a heap of shards. An identical heap marked the other side. Bell Recovery must\u2019ve blasted through it. Kyle Bell was trying to reclaim the trains. The metal alone would be worth a fortune, not to mention the contents of the cars. Once reclaimed, he would have to transport the metal out and he needed a road in decent repair. Except now there was broken glass all over it.</p><p>I got out of the vehicle and padded forward, careful not to step on anything too sharp. My paw-feet were calloused, and Lyc-V would seal any cuts the moment they were made, but it would still hurt. Ascanio followed me.</p><p>The shards littered the asphalt, large slivers of glass at the edges, and smaller crushed glass dust in the center. I crouched for a better perspective. Crushed glass ran in two parallel rows.</p><p>\u201cTrack vehicle,\u201d I said. \u201cThey\u2019re using a tractor or a bulldozer.\u201d The glass would slice our tires into shreds. \u201cPark the Jeep. We\u2019re going on foot.\u201d</p><p>We hid the Jeep behind a glass mountain and shut off the engine. The sudden silence made my ears ring. I took a crossbow and a longbow out of the vehicle.</p><p>\u201cWhy two bows, mistress?\u201d Ascanio asked, sinking a sudden English accent into his words.</p><p>\u201cThe crossbow has more power but takes longer to reload.\u201d I strung the longbow. \u201cSometimes you have to shoot fast. And can you go ten minutes without being a smartass?\u201d I grabbed the quiver.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, I\u2019ve never tried, mistress.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cBut arrows bounce from monsters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese don\u2019t.\u201d I pulled one out and showed him the incantation written on the arrowhead. One of the Military Supernatural Defense Unit\u2019s mages wasn\u2019t averse to moonlighting. He was expensive but worth it. \u201cBut if you have doubts, why don\u2019t you go stand over there. I\u2019ll shoot you and we\u2019ll find out if it hurts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo thanks.\u201d</p><p>I picked up the spare bow and the second quiver and handed it to him. \u201cThen shut up and carry this.\u201d</p><p>I started forward at an easy jog, skirting the road. Ascanio followed a couple feet behind. The glass swallowed all footsteps and we glided like two shadows.</p><p>A flicker of movement appeared in the corner of my eye. Something crouched atop the glass ridge to the left. Something with a long tail that hid in the shadows. I kept running, pretending I didn\u2019t see it. It didn\u2019t follow.</p><p>A muted roar announced water engines being put to good use. We passed under another glass overhang, running parallel to the road. Ahead the ribbon of asphalt turned, rolling through the opening between the glass peaks into the sunlight. I slowed and padded on silent feet to the nearest iceberg ledge, about fifteen feet off the ground. Too smooth to climb. I gathered myself into a tight clump and jumped. My hands caught the glass edge, and I pulled myself up. Ascanio bounced up next to me. We crawled along the ledge to the opening. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A clearing stretched in front of us, about half a football field long. To the right the ground climbed up slightly, the slope studded with pale green glass boulders. A large construction shelter perched on top of the raised ground, its durable fabric stretched over an aluminum frame. To the left a mess of glass bristling with shards curved away, deeper into the glass labyrinth. The tail end of an overturned railroad car stuck out of shards.</p><p>An enchanted water engine sat nearby, powering up a massive jackhammer that two construction workers with hardhats and full facial shields pointed at the glass encrusting the train car. Eight other workers, wrapped in similar protective gear, pounded away at the glass with hammers and mining picks.</p><p>Three guards milled about the perimeter, each armed with a machete. The nearest to us, a tall, broad-shouldered man in his mid-thirties, looked like he wouldn\u2019t hesitate to use his. With the magic up, guns wouldn\u2019t fire, but the security seemed too light for a reclamation in the Glass Menagerie. They must\u2019ve had something else up their sleeves.</p> <p>\u201cYou see what they\u2019re doing?\u201d I murmured to Ascanio.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re trying to salvage that railcar,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhy is it illegal?\u201d</p><p>He thought about it. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t belong to them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTechnically the railroad has gone out of business, so this is abandoned property. Try again.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are we sitting on?\u201d</p><p>He looked down at the turquoise surface under our feet. \u201cMagic glass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do we know about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cExactly. We don\u2019t know what makes it grow and we don\u2019t know what would make it stop.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo anything they take out of that rail car could sprout glass,\u201d Ascanio said.</p><p>\u201cPrecisely. They\u2019re going to sell whatever they reclaim and they won\u2019t tell the buyer where they got it. And when another Glass Menagerie sprouts someplace, it will be too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t we do something about it?\u201d</p><p>I held up my empty hand. \u201cNo badge. We can report it when we get out of here and see if PAD wants to do something about it.\u201d Besides, it wasn\u2019t our job to report it and I was pretty much done with acts of civic responsibility. It wasn\u2019t my problem.</p><p>\u201cThey have to know that what they\u2019re doing is illegal,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd this area is dangerous, so they should have more than three bruisers walking about with oversized knives. They have some security we\u2019re not seeing. Be ready for a surprise.\u201d</p><p>Ascanio\u2019s eyes lit up with an eerie ruby glow. \u201cCan I shift now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d Shifting took a lot of energy. Change your shape twice in rapid succession, and you would have to have some downtime. I needed Ascanio fresh and full of energy, which meant once he shifted, he\u2019d have to stay that way.</p><p>We jumped off the ledge and walked down the road straight into the guard. He saw my face and drew back.</p> <p>\u201cWhat in the bloody hell are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAndrea Nash,\u201d I said. \u201cThis is my associate, Robin of Loxley.\u201d</p><p>Ascanio saluted with the bow. Thankfully no Latin spilled out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m investigating a murder on behalf of the Pack. I need to talk to Kyle.\u201d</p><p>The man stared at me. This was clearly outside of his normal duties.</p><p>\u201cYou got some sort of ID on you?\u201d</p><p>I handed him my ID\u2014a miniature copy of my PI license endorsed by the Georgia Secretary of State with my picture on it.</p><p>\u201cHow do I know it\u2019s you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWhy would I lie?\u201d</p><p>He mulled it over. \u201cOkay, you\u2019ve got something that says you\u2019re from the Pack?\u201d</p><p>Ascanio coughed a bit.</p><p>I swept the hand from my forehead to my chin, indicating my face. \u201cDo I look like I need to prove I\u2019m from the Pack?\u201d</p><p>The guard pondered me. \u201cOkay, fine. Come with me.\u201d</p><p>We followed him to the tent. It looked bigger close up, almost forty feet tall. Inside, a middle-aged man pored over some charts next to a taller, thinner man with acne scars on his narrow face. Both wore hardhats.</p><p>The middle-aged man looked up. Stocky, well muscled, he might have been quick at some point in his youth, but probably not. He looked like one of those linemen that plant themselves in front of the quarterback, except in his case he\u2019d let himself go a bit and most of his muscle now hid behind a layer of fat. His hair was gray and cropped short, but his dark eyes were sharp. He didn\u2019t look friendly. He looked like the kind of guy who could order a shapeshifter murder.</p><p>Kyle gave me a once-over and focused on the guard. \u201cWhat the hell is this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome people from the Pack want to talk to you,\u201d the guard said. \u201cAbout some murder.\u201d</p><p>Kyle leaned back, his face sour. \u201cTony, do you remember that time I told you to just let any asshole in here?\u201d</p><p>The guard winced. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I don\u2019t remember that either. Felipe, you remember that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d the taller man said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought.\u201d</p><p>Tony paused, obviously confused. \u201cSo what do I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThrow them the fuck out. If I want to talk to any ugly bitches or punk kids, I\u2019ll tell you.\u201d Kyle looked back to his papers.</p><p>Tony put his hand on my forearm. \u201cCome on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake your hand off of me, sir.\u201d</p><p>The guard pulled me. \u201cDon\u2019t make this hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast chance. Take your hand off of me.\u201d</p><p>Kyle looked up.</p><p>Tony tried to yank me back. I raised my arm up sharply and elbowed him in the face. The blow knocked him back. Tony dropped his machete. It bit into the dirt, handle sticking upright. Blood gushed from his nose, its scent piercing me like a shot of adrenaline.</p><p>\u201cSit on him,\u201d I said.</p><p>Ascanio tripped Tony, pulled him to the ground, facedown, and leaned one knee on his back. \u201cDon\u2019t move, sir.\u201d</p><p>He remembered. I felt so proud.</p><p>Tony tried to push up. \u201cGet off of me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo not struggle, or I\u2019ll be forced to break your arm.\u201d</p><p>Tony shut up.</p><p>Kyle looked at me. Behind him, Felipe carefully took a couple of steps back.</p><p>\u201cWe can talk about the murders now.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>\u201cAnd if I don\u2019t feel like talking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make you,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ve had an unpleasant day and four of our people are dead. I feel like having some fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shapeshifters are getting ballsy,\u201d Kyle said. \u201cYou think you can just come in anywhere and screw with regular decent people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs a matter of fact, I can.\u201d I looked at him.</p><p>\u201cThe boys down at PAD will just love that,\u201d Felipe, the taller man behind Kyle, said.</p><p>Ha! He was threatening me with cops. \u201cThe boys down at PAD won\u2019t give a shit. This area is designated as IM-1. You are here in violation of two city ordinances, one state and two federal statutes. Anything you reclaim is contaminated with magic of unknown origin. Taking it out of here is punishable by a fine of not more than two hundred thousand dollars or imprisonment for not more than ten years, or both. Selling it will get you another dime in a state penitentiary.\u201d</p><p>Kyle crossed his arms. \u201cIs that so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreed is a terrible thing,\u201d I said. \u201cWhen you extract your metal and sell it to a builder, and then the new school or hospital in the city starts sprouting glass, they will come looking for you. At the moment, it\u2019s not my problem. I\u2019m here to ask questions. Answer them and I\u2019ll thank you and go away. Do keep in mind that if you piss me off, I can slaughter the lot of you and nobody will give a crap.\u201d</p><p>And I could. I could just twist his head off and nobody would be the wiser. This was the Glass Menagerie and if he died, the cops would just think he got what was coming to him. Now there was an interesting thought.</p><p>A creature walked into the tent, moving on all fours. It used to be human, but all fat had been leeched off it, replaced by hard, knotted muscle and skin stretched so tight, it looked painted on. Its head was bald, like the rest of its repulsive frame and the two eyes, red and feverish with thirst, bore into me like two burning coals. Its oversized jaws protruded, and as it opened its mouth, I glimpsed two curved fangs.</p><p>A vampire. The revolting stink of undeath swirled around me, raising my hackles in instinctive disgust. Ew. Well, that explained the light security. They had an undead guarding them. And where there was a vampire, there was a navigator.</p><p>Infection by the Immortuus pathogen destroyed a human\u2019s mind. No cognizance remained. Vampires were ruled only by instinct and that instinct screamed, \u201cFeed!\u201d They did not reproduce. They did not think. They hunted flesh. Anything with a pulse was fair game. Their blank minds made perfect vehicles for necromancers. Called navigators, or Masters of the Dead, if they had talent and education, necromancers piloted vampires, driving them around telepathically like remote-controlled cars. They saw through the vampire\u2019s eyes, they heard through its ears, and when an undead opened its mouth, it was the navigator\u2019s words that came out.</p><p>Most of the navigators worked for the People. The People and the Pack existed in a state of uneasy truce, hovering on the verge of full-out war. If the People were running security for this site, my life would get a lot more complicated.</p><p>A man followed the vampire. He wore ripped jeans, a black T-shirt that said MAKE MY DAY in bloody red letters, and sported a dozen rings in various parts of his facial features. He could\u2019ve been one of the People\u2019s journeymen, but it was highly unlikely. Strike one, he followed his vampire instead of sitting somewhere outside being inconspicuous, pulling the undead\u2019s strings with his mind. Strike two, the People\u2019s journeymen looked like they just emerged from arguing a case before the Supreme Court. They wore suits, had good shoes, and were impeccably groomed.</p><p>No, this knucklehead had to be a freelancer, which meant I could kill him without diplomatic consequences, if he didn\u2019t kill me first. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhere the hell have you been, Envy?\u201d Kyle said.</p><p>I looked at him. \u201cEnvy?\u201d</p><p>Ascanio chortled.</p> <p>\u201cAround,\u201d Envy said.</p><p>\u201cI want them gone,\u201d Kyle said. \u201cDo your fucking job.\u201d</p><p>The vamp hissed. Envy smiled, showing bad teeth.</p><p>Ascanio gathered himself. \u201cCan I shift now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I turned, stepping closer to the machete Tony had dropped on the ground and looked at the navigator. \u201cYou have a chance to walk away. Take it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCan I kill them?\u201d Envy asked.</p><p>\u201cYou can do whatever you want,\u201d Kyle told him.</p><p>I had to do this fast. Getting into a hand-to-hand brawl with a vampire would end badly. I would\u2019ve preferred to wrestle an enraged mama grizzly. \u201cWalk away. Last chance.\u201d</p><p>Envy grinned. \u201cPray, bitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you affiliated with the People?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cFuck, no.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWrong answer.\u201d</p><p>Outside, glass shattered. A scream tore through the quiet, the raw painful scream of a man experiencing sheer terror. Two more followed.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell now?\u201d Kyle growled.</p><p>We piled out of the tent.</p><p>The rail car had split open at the top, like a can of bad beans, and creatures poured out, climbing onto its roof. Thick pale-gray hide covered their squat, barrel-chested bodies, supported by six muscled bearlike legs. Hand-paws tipped each limb, and their long dexterous fingers carried short but thick ivory claws. A narrow carapace ran along their backs and when one of the creatures reared, I saw an identical bony shield guarding its stomach and chest. The carapace terminated in a long, segmented tail with a scorpion stinger. They had large round heads with feline jaws and twin rows of tiny eyes, sitting deep in their sockets. The eyes stared to the front, not to the side. That usually meant a predator.</p><p>The beasts scuttled across the sleek surface, sticking to the glass as if they had glue on the pads of the paws. The largest of them was about six feet long and had to push three hundred pounds. The smallest was about the size of a large dog. That meant some of them were babies. Hungry, hungry babies.</p><p>The workers backed away, brandishing their tools. Only one exit led out of this glass bowl and it lay on the opposite side, almost directly behind the train car and the creatures.</p><p>The horde focused on the people, watching them with the intense attention of hungry predators who were trying to decide if something was food. The larger of the creatures raised its head. Its wide jaws parted, revealing a small forest of crooked fangs. Meat-eater. Of course.</p> <p>The workers stopped moving.</p><p>The largest beast stared at the people below, turning left, right, left...Muscles bunched on his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cBack away,\u201d Kyle called out. \u201cDon\u2019t provoke it. Envy, get in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a minute,\u201d the navigator said.</p><p>The beast leaped, aiming for the center of the crowd. People scattered, splitting into two groups\u2014the eight people closest to us ran toward the tent, while twice as many sprinted away in the opposite direction, toward the glass wall.</p><p>The beast chased after the farther, larger group. One of the guards, a large dark-skinned man, charged at it. The beast hooted, like a colossal owl, and snapped its teeth. The guard dodged, swung, and chopped at the beast\u2019s neck. The machete cut bone and gristle like a meat cleaver.</p><p>The beast\u2019s head drooped to the side, half severed. The scent of blood hit me, bitter and revolting. My predatory instincts backpedaled\u2014whatever that thing was, it wasn\u2019t good to eat.</p><p>The creature staggered and crashed down. Dark blood, thick and rust-brown, spilled onto the glass.</p><p>The horde broke out in alarmed hoots.</p><p>\u201cNot so tough,\u201d Felipe told Kyle, the relief plain in his voice.</p><p>The ground trembled. The walls of the railcar burst. A behemoth spilled out, huge, grotesquely muscled, its forelimbs like tree trunks. I\u2019d once seen a dog as big as a house. This was larger. It was taller than the construction tent. How the hell did it even fit under there?</p><p>Kyle swore.</p><p>The beast sighted the dead offspring, opened its maw, and bellowed. She looked just like her babies, except for the bone carapace that sheathed most of her upper face as if someone had pulled her skull out and clamped it over her ugly mug. Her four eyes were barely the size of Ping-Pong balls. Trying to shoot them with an arrow would be a pain in the ass.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Envy said. \u201cI\u2019m out.\u201d</p><p>Kyle\u2019s eyes bulged. \u201cI paid you, you maggot!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot enough,\u201d Envy said.</p><p>The vamp grabbed him, swinging the navigator over its back, and dashed away, leaping over people and dodging beasts. A moment and it vanished into the glass forest.</p><p>Kyle\u2019s face turned purple in a fit of sudden rage. He struggled to say something.</p><p>Spurned by their parent\u2019s roar, the creatures slunk toward the larger group.</p><p>Felipe grabbed my arm. \u201cHelp us!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I was done with the civil servant bit. It was no longer my job to save every idiot from the consequences of their own stupidity. They walked into the Glass Menagerie on their own, knowing the risks. Why should I put my life in danger for the people who tried to sic a vamp on me? I owed them nothing. I just had to get the information I needed from Kyle and make sure that Ascanio and I got out of there in one piece.</p><p>The beasts circled the larger group. The workers hugged the glass wall. It wouldn\u2019t be long now before one of the creatures got brave enough.</p><p>\u201cPlease!\u201d Felipe\u2019s eyes were desperate. \u201cMy son is down there.\u201d</p><p>So what? Everyone was somebody\u2019s husband, wife, somebody\u2019s son, somebody\u2019s Baby Rory...</p><p>Aw, shit.</p><p>I looked at Felipe\u2019s face and saw Nick there. Their features were nothing alike, but that\u2019s exactly what Nick must\u2019ve looked like when told his wife was dead. Felipe stared at me with wide-open eyes, desperate and terrified, his face sharpened, as if he were about to wince in pain and cry out. Every wrinkle gouged his skin like a scar. All of the rules society imposed on men, all of the obligations to be the brave one, to never panic, to handle themselves with stony dignity, all of them were wiped away, because he was about to lose his son. He was helpless. He begged me for his child\u2019s life and I knew that he would trade places with his boy without a moment\u2019s hesitation.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t just stand there and watch him as his son was eaten alive. It was not in me. The person who would walk away from that man wasn\u2019t who I was or wanted to be.</p><p>I slipped the scabbard off my arm and handed it to Ascanio. \u201cArrow!\u201d</p><p>He yanked an arrow out and put in my palm. I notched it. \u201cI\u2019ll be shooting fast. Have the next arrow ready.\u201d</p><p>I drew the bow.</p><p>The bravest beast jumped, aiming for the nearest worker.</p><p>The bow string and the arrow sang together in a vicious happy duet. The arrowhead sliced into the creature\u2019s throat. The first beast fell, hissing, trying to swipe at the shaft with its paw. The arrow whined. A blue light sparked at the wound and the beast exploded.</p><p>I held my hand out and Ascanio put another arrow into it.</p><p>The second beast followed the first. A moment later, the second explosion hurled chunks of flesh and bone into the pack. I didn\u2019t have time to watch. I kept shooting, fast, precise, filling the air with arrows.</p><p>The beasts panicked. They dashed to and fro amidst their exploding siblings, biting and clawing at each other. The Mother Beast roared, snapping massive jaws at random, unable to figure out what was killing her babies.</p><p>\u201cRun!\u201d I screamed.</p><p>The workers dashed toward us, running along the wall. The beasts chased them. The air whistled in a nonstop deadly chorus, as my arrows found targets.</p><p>Felipe grabbed a pickaxe out of another man\u2019s hands and ran toward the group. A woman to my left charged in after him, and so did Tony\u2014the guard\u2014and two others.</p><p>One of the workers, a small woman, stumbled, fell, and slid down the glass slope. Two beasts fell on her, ripping into the woman with wet, gurgling growls. I sank two arrows into them, but it was too late. The woman screamed, a short guttural cry, cut off in mid-note. Blood drenched the glass. A moment later the arrow detonated and human and beast rained over the glass in a bloody deluge.</p><p>The first runner made it to the tent and collapsed behind me. The rest followed. Finally Felipe and the dark-skinned guard made it in, both splattered with gore.</p><p>The Mother Beast spun toward us. Finally found the enemy, did you?</p><p>\u201cForm a perimeter!\u201d I barked. \u201cTime to fight for your lives! Use whatever you got.\u201d</p><p>The workers scrambled to form a line.</p><p>The monster ducked her head, and I saw a narrow slit in her carapace, located high between her eyes. Soft pink tissue expanded and contracted, filling the foot-wide slit and then retracting. Hello, target.</p><p>The beast swung her head again and bellowed in my direction. The wave of sound hit me like the roar of a tornado. I\u2019d have to take the mother out or none of us would get out alive.</p><p>\u201cCan I shift now?\u201d Ascanio asked.</p><p>\u201cYes. Now.\u201d</p><p>Ascanio\u2019s skin ruptured. Powerful muscle wound about his skeleton, skin sheathed it, and pale brownish-gray fur sprouted through it. A dark mane grew on his head and dripped down the back of his neck, over his spine. Pale stripes sliced his forelimbs, ending in five-inch claws. His face, like his body, became a meld of human and striped hyena. His eyes flashed with red.</p><p>The Mother Beast lifted one colossal front paw and took a step forward. The ground shook.</p><p>The bouda opened his mouth and roared back, breaking into bloodcurdling hyena laughter. My hackles rose. There\u2019s my pretty boy.</p><p>\u201cKeep her occupied!\u201d I barked. \u201cMake her face this way.\u201d</p><p>Ascanio leaped over the workers\u2019 heads and dashed down to the monster. He swatted a smallish beast out of the way. It yelped and the behemoth swung in his direction.</p><p>I drew my bow. Not yet.</p><p>Ascanio backhanded another creature.</p><p>Not yet. I had time.</p><p>The behemoth ducked down, snarling.</p><p>Not yet...</p><p>The huge teeth snapped at Ascanio. He ducked, escaping by a couple of inches. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I let the arrow go. It sliced through the air, propelled as much by the bowstring as by my will, and sliced straight into the unprotected area of her head. Yes! Nailed it!</p><p>The arrow whined and exploded. Blood shot out of the behemoth\u2019s nostrils. She shook her head...and charged Ascanio. He leaped up and left, bounced off the glass, and jumped behind her, slicing the behemoth\u2019s leg with his claws on the way.</p><p>Damn it. It didn\u2019t even faze her.</p> <p>Ascanio and my arrows weren\u2019t doing enough damage. Neither would machetes. We could hack at her all day, and we\u2019d do no good.</p><p>The behemoth chased Ascanio. The boy jumped back and forth, dashing like some mad rabbit. He couldn\u2019t keep this up forever.</p><p>If only we had something, some weapon, something...</p><p>The monster swung her tail, right over the heavy jackhammer laying abandoned on the glass. It was still attached to the tank by the hose that pumped enchanted water into it. The hose was way too short to reach the beast.</p><p>I spun to Felipe. \u201cWill it work without the hose?\u201d</p> <p>It took him a second. \u201cYes!\u201d He jerked his hand up, fingers spread. \u201cFive minutes.\u201d</p><p>I threw down my bow and sprinted to the jackhammer. My paws slipped on the glass, slick with beast blood. I slid, jumped, landed by the jackhammer, and heaved it off the ground. A heavy bastard.</p><p>A tree-trunk-sized monster leg loomed in front of me. I leaped and clawed my way up the beast to the top, hauling the jackhammer with me. The freaking thing must\u2019ve weighed three hundred pounds, and I had to drag it one-handed. My right arm felt like it would wrench out of the socket. I pulled myself up, digging into the monster\u2019s hide with my left hand and my hind claws.</p><p>The creature moved, chasing Ascanio. Her muscles bulged under me. I clung to her, like a flea, and scrambled up.</p><p>I made it over the shoulder and ran toward her head. She roared again and I planted the jackhammer right at the base of her neck, the only spot unprotected by the carapace.</p><p>I flipped the jackhammer\u2019s ON switch.</p> <p>Nothing.</p><p>Below people were yelling something. I flicked my ears.</p><p>\u201cChant! Chant it to start!\u201d</p><p>Aaaargh. I chanted, praying it would start faster than our cars did.</p><p>Ascanio dashed around the work site, buying me time. Below, the smaller monsters attacked the line of workers.</p><p>Work, I willed, chanting. Work, you blasted stupid tool.</p><p>Work.</p><p>Work.</p> <p>The jackhammer shuddered in my hands. I dug my foot claws into the beast\u2019s back and plunged the jackhammer deep into the behemoth\u2019s flesh. The chisel pounded into the creature\u2019s muscle. Hot blood drenched my feet.</p><p>The beast howled in agony, deafening me with the sound of her torture. The jackhammer ate its way down, into her body, and I clung to it, sinking in.</p><p>The behemoth shook like a wet dog. I gripped the jackhammer and drove it deeper and deeper. It pulled me in. My arms sank into wet flesh. I took a deep breath and then my nose and my face connected with bloody mush. Pressure ground me. I heard a dull rhythmic sound and realized it was the beast\u2019s heart beating next to me.</p><p>Suddenly the full weight of the jackhammer hit my arms. I fell.</p><p>The jackhammer hit the ground, dead, and I landed on top of it, its handle conveniently impacting with my rib cage.</p><p>Ow. That\u2019s a cracked rib for sure.</p><p>Above me the beast stumbled, a red hole in her chest dripping blood and liquefied flesh.</p><p>I sprinted away, running for my life.</p><p>The creature teetered, blocking out the sun, and crashed down with a deafening thud. The glass floor of the clearing shattered from the impact. Fractures raced from her body up into the translucent glass icebergs. For a fraction of a second nothing moved, and then giant chunks of glass slid from the walls and plummeted down, exploding into razor-sharp shrapnel.</p><p>I threw myself behind the enchanted water tank.</p><p>All around me glass fell with thunderous blasts, as if I were crouched in the middle of an artillery salvo. Shards slashed at my hide, stinging me like a swarm of bees. I smelled my own blood. The ground shook.</p><p>Gradually the bursts slowed. Silence claimed the clearing. I straightened.</p><p>Where is the boy?</p><p>The tent lay in shambles, crushed beneath a chunk of amber glass the size of an SUV. A man was crying, his leg sliced open. People were slowly rising from hiding. I scanned the survivors. Felipe was hugging a young man. At least his son had survived.</p><p>No Ascanio.</p><p>Please be alive.</p><p>A loud hyena cackle rang through the clearing. I turned. He stood on top of the beast. Blood drenched his fur. His monster-mouth split in a happy, psychotic grin.</p><p>I exhaled.</p><p>Gradually it sank in. The Mother Beast was dead. I had killed her. The taste of her blood burned in my mouth. Behind her, a deep black hole bore into the ground beneath the remnants of the railroad car. It must\u2019ve been her underground lair. She had raised her brood there, safe and far away from everyone, until Kyle\u2019s crew invaded her den.</p><p>Such an awful waste. None of this was necessary. At least one person died, many others were injured, and this great magnificent beast and her brood lost their lives all because Kyle Bell wanted to make a quick buck on the side. He stood by the remnants of the tent now, arms crossed, barking orders.</p><p>I marched over to Kyle. He saw me, opened his mouth, and I backhanded him. The blow knocked him to the ground. \u201cThis is your fault. You brought these people here. You knew this place was dangerous.\u201d I pulled him upright and spun him toward the dead beast. \u201cLook! People died because of you. Do you understand that? If it wasn\u2019t for you, I wouldn\u2019t have had to murder her. She was just protecting her children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe tried to kill us!\u201d</p><p>I backhanded him again. \u201cShe tried to kill you because you broke into her house.\u201d</p><p>The workers stood around us, their faces grim. Nobody made any move to help their boss.</p><p>I looked at them. \u201cAnything you reclaim here is contaminated. Being here is a crime. Taking anything out of this zone is a crime. You need to know this.\u201d</p><p>Kyle stayed down, until I grabbed him by his shirt and pulled him up, his face two inches from mine. \u201cI will ask this only once. What was in the vault under the Blue Heron?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat vault?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou answer her,\u201d Felipe said. \u201cYou tell her everything now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what the hell this bitch is talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t answer me, I\u2019ll kill you.\u201d I shook him, my bloody claws staining his shirt with the behemoth\u2019s gore. \u201cWhat was in the vault?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d he screamed. \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about any vault! I swear!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you have something to do with the murders at the Blue Heron site? Answer me!\u201d</p><p>His pupils dilated and he was hanging in my hands, completely limp, paralyzed by fear. He wasn\u2019t lying. People in a state of complete panic freeze or run. Mother Nature turns off their mental faculties, so her favorite children don\u2019t think themselves to death. Kyle was too terrified to formulate a lie. He truly had no idea what I was talking about.</p><p>I dropped him and looked at his crew. \u201cHe\u2019s all yours. You need to clear out. I\u2019m reporting this site to the first cop I see.\u201d</p><p>I found my bow and quiver and walked away. Ascanio jumped off the beast and joined me. His voice was a deep growl, shredded by his teeth. \u201cIt. Wash. Aweshome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis was a tragedy.\u201d People came before animals. I knew that, but when you turn into an animal, your perspective is a little different.</p><p>\u201cYesh. But aweshome.\u201d</p><p>He was a boy. What did he know?</p><p>\u201cSho, we didn\u2019t learrrn anyshing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true. We established that Kyle Bell had nothing to do with the murders. We can eliminate him from our suspect pool. Are you hungry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShhtarrrving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Let\u2019s go find something to eat.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 5</p><p>The best thing about Big Papaw\u2019s Cookout was their brine. Big Papaw guarded its secret like it was weaponized plague, but there is very little you could keep from a shapeshifter\u2019s taste buds. That brine had root beer, paprika, garlic, pepper, and salt in it, and after the pork ribs had soaked in it for at least a day, Papaw threw them on the grill with some hickory wood chips. I could smell it a mile off, two if the wind was stronger, and it made me drool.</p><p>The restaurant was located in an old abandoned gas station, with smoke grills in the back, outside. I parked the Jeep in the parking lot\u2014my beastkin feet were smaller than Ascanio\u2019s huge warrior-form paws, so I had to drive\u2014and Ascanio and I went inside.</p><p>Colleen, Big Papaw\u2019s oldest daughter, manned the counters. She gave me the evil eye and kept one hand under the counter, which I decided not to hold against her. When two furry, blood-soaked creatures walk into your place, anybody would get alarmed.</p><p>I dug in my pants and pulled out two twenties. \u201cHey, Colleen. We need as many ribs as this will buy.\u201d</p><p>Colleen raised her eyebrows. \u201cDo I know you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me, Andrea. You can quit stroking the shotgun now. We\u2019re not a threat to anything except your barbeque.\u201d</p><p>Colleen blinked. \u201cAndy? I didn\u2019t know you\u2019re a shapeshifter.\u201d</p><p>Neither did anybody else. \u201cSurprise, surprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe ish harrrmlesh,\u201d Ascanio assured her, smiled, and winked, flashing huge teeth.</p><p>Colleen winced, swept my money off the counter, went to the back, and came back carrying a metal pan with three huge slabs of ribs piled on it.</p><p>Ascanio grabbed the pan.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I said. \u201cWe\u2019ll eat in the parking lot and bring you the pan once we\u2019re done. Don\u2019t want to alarm your regulars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMuch appreciated.\u201d</p><p>We headed into the parking lot and sat on the low brick wall surrounding it, with the pan of ribs between us. Ascanio stared at the meat. That\u2019s right. I was the alpha and even the devil child had learned that in the Pack one doesn\u2019t eat until his alpha gives him permission.</p><p>I ripped one slab in half and gave him one chunk of it. He took it and tore into the meat, crunching bones. I bit into my ribs, my hyena teeth crushing the soft bone. The sweet taste exploded in my mouth. Mmm. Food. Yummy food. So hungry. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>We went through two slabs before either one of us decided to slow down enough to talk.</p><p>\u201cCan I assssk a bad quessshtion?\u201d Ascanio asked.</p><p>I thought of reminding him that he\u2019d promised to be good, but after everything he\u2019d been through today, he had earned some leeway. \u201cShoot.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow come you\u2019re beasssshtin?\u201d</p><p>He would have to ask that question, wouldn\u2019t he? I sucked on a bone, buying time. Telling the kid I was too chicken to talk about it wasn\u2019t an option. \u201cLet\u2019s take the Atlanta Pack. Seven clans, each grouped by the beast. Within the clans you have structure. At the top of it are the alphas, then the betas, then other people in charge of different things appointed by the alphas. The alphas themselves make up the Council, which is led by the Beast Lord and the Consort. For the individual shapeshifter, there are all sorts of safeguards in place. If you have a problem with someone or someone is abusing you, you can take it up the chain of command all the way to Curran and you will be treated fairly. You may not like the decision, but it will be just.\u201d</p><p>Ascanio nodded.</p><p>\u201cKids like you don\u2019t realize it, but this sort of structure is pretty new. Curran has only been in power for about fifteen years. Before that, each clan was on its own, and some, like Clan Wolf or Clan Rat, were broken up into individual little packs. Each pack was only as good as its alpha. If the alpha was an abusive asshole, you couldn\u2019t do much about it.\u201d</p><p>I handed him another chunk of ribs. \u201cMy mother was a first generation shapeshifter. She grew up on a small ranch in southern Oklahoma with her mom and dad. One day a loup bouda got into their farm. He slaughtered the horses, killed my grandfather, and attacked my mom and my grandmother. My mother was fourteen years old and she had never seen a hyena before, let alone a shapeshifter. My grandmother killed the loup, but then went loup herself. My mother hid in the storm shelter underground. By the time the sheriffs made it out to the farm, my grandmother had dug a hole almost six feet deep, trying to get my mother out to kill her. They put silver bullets through her brain real fast.</p> <p>\u201cSo my mom was fourteen, all alone, a shapeshifter, and not knowing a thing about being one. The sheriffs made some calls and found out that there was a small bouda pack in Eastern Texas. The alpha was female and oh so nice on the phone. She even offered to meet them halfway to take the poor girl off their hands. So they drove out and handed my mother and the twenty thousand dollars left over from my grandparents\u2019 life insurance over to Clarissa. Bypassed the whole Child Services mess and delivered her right to her own people. They thought it would be better for everyone that way.\u201d</p><p>I dropped my bones into the pan. \u201cClarissa was a sadistic bitch. She wasn\u2019t loup but she was damn close. She loved torture. Got off on it. Her own life turned out to be shit, so she made everyone else\u2019s miserable. She and her two daughters, Crystal and Candy, ran the pack of two dozen boudas. My mom was small like me. The first day she arrived, Crystal beat the shit out of her and then urinated on her face. It went downhill from there.\u201d</p><p>Ascanio stared at me, the ribs forgotten in his hands.</p><p>\u201cThe best we can figure out, my father was an exotic pet. The pack heard rumors of a drug dealer compound where a lot of large predators were being kept for show. Eventually law enforcement got around to raiding it, and three days later my father walked out of the brush. Lyc-V steals pieces of its host DNA and most of the time the transfer is from animal to human. For my father to exist, the virus had to have infected a human, and then passed from the human back to my father. This almost never happens because people don\u2019t run around the wilderness biting animals.\u201d</p><p>Even when shapeshifters encountered their natural counterparts while in beast form, most wildlife gave us a wide berth. A hundred-pound wolf looked at a two-hundred-and-fifty-pound werewolf and pretty quickly decided to run for the hills.</p><p>\u201cNobody could ever figure out how my father managed to get himself infected. He didn\u2019t have enough brain power to explain what happened to him. Clarissa thought that my father was the funniest thing ever. They put a spiked collar on him and would lead him on a leash while he was in his human form. He couldn\u2019t really talk, except for a handful of words like \u2018no\u2019 and \u2018hungry.\u2019 He was mentally deficient. Clarissa thought it would be oh so hilarious to have him rape my mother. He didn\u2019t know what he was doing. He just knew that there was a female provided for him, so he mated. My mother was barely sixteen. I was born nine months later and they started beating me when I was still a toddler. For my mother, her chief tormentor was Crystal. For me, it was Candy, Clarissa\u2019s younger daughter.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDidn\u2019t your mom trrrry to prrrotect you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe tried, but they would gang up on her. She used to bait them when they would start on me, because they would switch over to her instead. They told her that if she left, humans would kill her and me. She had no money and nowhere to go. On my eleventh birthday Candy and her flunkies set me on fire. My mother realized that sooner or later they would kill me. As soon as I healed enough to move, my mother grabbed me and ran. We ran clear across the country. They never came after us.\u201d</p><p>A memory flashed before me, my mother and I huddling in the bathroom in some hotel room, wrapped in a blanket, both of us shivering because some stray noise outside reminded us of Clarissa\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to upsshet you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Finish your food.\u201d</p><p>He looked at the ribs. \u201cNot hungrrry anymorre.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d I told him. \u201cDon\u2019t let it go to waste.\u201d</p><p>He bit into the rib. \u201cDid you ever go back?\u201d</p> <p>I smiled at him. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>He blinked.</p><p>\u201cFunny thing about that pack,\u201d I said. \u201cA few years ago someone went over there and wiped them out. Must\u2019ve been some sort of marksman, because most of them had been shot from a distance. Very clean shots, with silver bullets.\u201d I leaned over and touched a spot at the base of his skull about half an inch below his earlobe. \u201cApricot. Also known as medulla oblongata. It\u2019s an area of the brain that controls involuntary functions: breathing, heart rate, digestion. It is the only place in the shapeshifter body that guarantees instant death when hit by a silver bullet. Very small target.\u201d I held my fingers a little over an inch apart. \u201cTiny. Takes a lot of practice.\u201d</p><p>Ascanio\u2019s eyes were huge on his bouda face.</p><p>Not everyone got a clean death. Some were more up close and personal. Not everyone died either. There were four children\u2014all boys\u2014and three adolescents\u2014two girls and a boy\u2014in chains. The next generation, new victims of Clarissa\u2019s tender love and care. They made it.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to yourrr dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe died about two years after we ran away. He was a hyena and they only live about twelve years or so in the wild. He probably lived twice that. If you\u2019re done eating, we need to get a move on.\u201d</p><p>He hopped off the wall.</p><p>We wiped our faces with the towel from the Jeep, returned the pan, and drove out.</p><p>\u201cWhereee to now?\u201d Ascanio asked.</p><p>\u201cGarcia Construction.\u201d I highly doubted that we would even be allowed to enter Anapa\u2019s HQ in our current shapes.</p><p>Garcia Construction had an address on the east side of the city, in the tangle of newly renamed streets, and it took us a good hour and a half to find it. The building sat in the back of a lot behind a chain-link fence, but the gate stood wide open. We parked on the street and breezed right in. Gravel crunched under my paw-feet. I really hated gravel. It was sharp, it got stuck between your toes, and it didn\u2019t exactly provide a stable surface.</p><p>Random dirt and refuse littered the gravel lot before the structure. The building itself was nothing special: built post-Shift, with magic in mind. Just a brick box, with barred dusty windows and a barred door, a standard house for a world where monsters spawned out of thin air and tried to break into your house to eat you. Another chain-link gate, on the right of the building and also wide open, led to the back lot.</p><p>The place smelled abandoned: squirrels, the musk of a tomcat on the prowl, dog excrement decomposing in the sun, tree rats. No human odors. Odd.</p><p>I ran my fingers along the wooden board nailed tight across the double door. Dirt.</p><p>\u201cThey arrrre closshed,\u201d Ascanio observed.</p><p>\u201cIt looks that way. Either the Heron building was supposed to be their big comeback and they didn\u2019t rehire anyone until they got a contract, or...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOrrr?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr someone hired them specifically to reclaim the Heron Building and when the deal fell through, the client abandoned them. Come on, we\u2019re going to dig in their garbage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh boy!\u201d</p><p>Smartass.</p><p>The Dumpster by the fence didn\u2019t yield any new information. It wasn\u2019t exactly empty either. The moment we lifted the lid, a very upset mama skunk aimed her butt at us, and we dropped the lid pronto. Stupid May, everybody was having babies.</p><p>I went to check the mailbox, while Ascanio trotted off to the back.</p><p>The metal box was empty. No mail. Hmm.</p><p>\u201cI found shomeshing!\u201d Ascanio called.</p><p>I made my way to the back. The narrow space between the building and the fence opened into an enormous back lot, filled with random metal junk. Tiny creatures, fuzzy and quick, with long chinchilla tails, skittered over the refuse. The gravel lay unevenly. It looked like something had been dragged out.</p><p>Ascanio greeted me in the back, holding up a flat tire, with a jagged chunk of metal embedded in it. He stuck the tire under my nose. The scent of automotive lubricant wafted up. Fresh. Car grease changed its scent in the open. This was a recent blowout.</p><p>Someone had driven into this lot probably during the last week, no more than ten days ago for sure. I held up the tire. It wasn\u2019t just flat, it must\u2019ve exploded. The vehicle to which that tire belonged couldn\u2019t have gotten very far. I looked back at the drag marks. Someone had been towed out. That was the most likely explanation.</p><p>The dirt on the board blocking the door was months old. Magic had killed most of the cell phones\u2014if you had a working one, you were likely in the military. So how did this person get themselves out of their blown tire predicament? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I jogged to the street, with Ascanio at my heels. Two hundred yards down the road, a tall sign announced Downs Motor Care. Aha.</p><p>I pointed at the sign. \u201cThis would be a clue.\u201d</p><p>Ascanio chortled next to me. It sounded like something out of a nightmare.</p> <p>We walked to Downs Motor Care, which consisted of a parking lot littered with car parts and filled with random clunkers of both the mechanical and the magical persuasion. A large metal garage sat in the back. Two of the garage\u2019s four doors were open. In the first door, a man dug under the hood of a Dodge truck.</p><p>\u201cAfternoon!\u201d I called out.</p><p>The man spun about, saw us, and hit his head on the Dodge\u2019s hood. He was young, in good shape, with a face that looked like something had chewed on the left side of it and spat him out.</p><p>The mechanic yanked a large wrench from the nearby table. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>I held up twenty bucks. Six months ago I would\u2019ve flashed my Order ID. He would have instantly been put at ease and I would have gotten my information. But in the past couple of months of working with Kate I had learned that the private sector paid for the answers to their questions. It chafed me, but I needed to find the killer.</p> <p>\u201cLooking for some information, sir,\u201d I said.</p><p>Ascanio showed him the tire.</p><p>The mechanic studied us for a long moment. \u201cPut the money on the ground. Pin it with a rock and don\u2019t come any closer.\u201d</p><p>I should probably rethink running around in beastkin shape, especially if I kept getting bloody. All my witnesses seemed to be disturbed by it.</p><p>I put the twenty under the rock. \u201cDid you tow someone out of Garcia Construction in the last week or so?\u201d</p><p>The mechanic rested the wrench against his chest. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWho was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas she one of Garcia\u2019s regulars?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNever seen her before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did she look like?\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cAbout early forties, nice dress, good shoes. Well put together. Looked like a businesswoman to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she mention what her name was or what she was doing there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I changed the tire, she paid me, that was it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow did she pay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGave me a check.\u201d</p><p>I blinked at him a couple of times, before I remembered that fluttering my eyelashes didn\u2019t exactly go over well in my current shape. \u201cYou took a check from some woman you don\u2019t know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a check from her business. I called it into the bank; they said it was good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat sort of business?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember,\u201d he said. \u201cStore of some sort or the other. Art something.\u201d</p><p>Interesting. \u201cAny chance you can find that cancelled check?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have work to do,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m busy.\u201d</p><p>I showed him a card, bent down, and put it under the rock. \u201cIf you happen to run across the check, there is another fifty bucks in it for you. The address and phone number are on the card.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d he said. \u201cLike I said, I\u2019m busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for your time.\u201d</p><p>I walked off.</p><p>\u201cNow what?\u201d Ascanio asked.</p><p>\u201cNow we go to the office and bathe.\u201d</p><p>I was sitting in the office, with my beastkin feet on the desk and a bottle of Georgia Peach Iced Tea, custom-made for me by Burt\u2019s Liquor, where I\u2019d made a strategic stop before arriving at the office. Outside the barred window, evening had dimmed the sky to a deep purple. Ascanio was in the back, trying to scrub himself clean in the office shower. He\u2019d caught a nap on the way back to the office, so I expected him to emerge in his human shape and at least semi-conscious.</p><p>I sipped my drink. All in all, a productive day. A hell of a lot of excitement.</p><p>Footsteps. I twitched my furry round ear, listening. Light stride, sure steps...Kate.</p><p>The door swung open and Kate walked in. Her jeans and T-shirt were splattered with blood and she was carrying a severed vampire head. The T-shirt had a smiley face on it.</p><p>In my natural untanned state I was pale. If you put me into a pitch-black room, my face would probably light up like the moon. That\u2019s why I cultivated a sun habit that resulted in a mild pigment formation in my skin. I liked to call this tan golden brown. My favorite cosmetics company, Sorci\u00e8re, which had a slightly cannibalistic tendency to name all their foundation skin tones after food, liked to call my tan \u201ccream.\u201d Cream was only a couple of shades darker than the palest \u201cmilk.\u201d If I really baked myself, I could get all the way to \u201cvanilla blush,\u201d which meant pale beige. Woo-hoo.</p><p>Kate would need \u201cdusky honey\u201d at the very least. I knew this because a few weeks ago I had to explain to her what concealer was and why she couldn\u2019t use it by itself on the strange rash we got after clearing some odd rat-critters from an old warehouse. Putting concealer and foundation on Kate turned out to be a losing proposition, because after the first five minutes it bugged her and she kept rubbing her face until she looked like a clown who got painted up in the dark.</p><p>Her hair, put away into a long braid, was chocolate brown and her eyes were dark too, framed in dense black eyelashes, and oddly cut, large, but slightly elongated with curvy corners. The first time I saw her, I had stared, trying to figure out what the heck she was. There were shades of India there, or maybe Arabia, or possibly a touch of Asia. She could twist it any way she wanted, depending on makeup, which she rarely wore.</p><p>At first glance you looked at Kate and thought \u201cfighter,\u201d maybe merc. Five inches taller than me, she was all muscle\u2014well, and some boobs\u2014but mostly muscle. She moved like a predator and when she got pissed off, she exhaled aggression, like hot breath on a winter evening. Still, men looked, until they saw her eyes. Kate\u2019s eyes were crazy. It was that hidden-deep crazy that told you that you had no idea what the hell she would do next but whatever it was, the bad guys wouldn\u2019t like it.</p><p>Kate looked at me for a long second. \u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>I saluted her with my bottle. \u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>Kate went into the kitchen, pulled a ceramic dish from under the sink, sat the vamp\u2019s head into it, put it in the fridge, and washed her hands. She came back, slipped the sheath off her back with her sword still in it, hung it on my client chair, and plopped into it.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you drinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGeorgia Peach Iced Tea. Want some?\u201d I offered it to her with my claws.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d She took a sip, and coughed with a grimace. \u201cWhat the hell is in this?\u201d</p><p>Heh-heh. Lightweight. \u201cVodka, gin, rum, sweet and sour, and peach schnapps. Lots of peach schnapps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you actually get a buzz from this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSort of.\u201d Lyc-V made it very difficult to get drunk. \u201cIt lasts for about thirty seconds or so and then I need another gulp.\u201d</p><p>Kate leaned back against her chair. \u201cWhere is the bane of my existence?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the shower, freshening up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God, who did Ascanio screw now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, he\u2019s covered in blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh good.\u201d She sighed and stopped. \u201cThe kid is covered in blood and we\u2019re relieved. There is something wrong with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about it.\u201d I took another swig. \u201cNot going to mention my beastkin appearance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like it,\u201d she said. \u201cThe torn pants and gore-stained T-shirt is a nice touch.\u201d</p><p>I wiggled my toes. \u201cI was thinking of painting my claws a nice shade of pink.\u201d</p><p>Kate glanced at my feet. \u201cThat would take a lot of nail polish. What about some golden hoops in your ears instead?\u201d</p><p>I grinned. \u201cIt\u2019s a definite possibility.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Kate asked.</p><p>\u201cI saw Raphael this morning. I\u2019d called him last night, because Jim put me on some shapeshifter murders and I needed to interview him. I wanted a chance to apologize.\u201d</p><p>Kate took my bottle and drank from it. \u201cHow did it go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe replaced me.\u201d</p><p>The bottle stopped in Kate\u2019s hand, three inches above the table. \u201cHe what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe found another girl. She is seven feet tall, with breasts the size of honeydew melons, legs that start at her neck, bleached blond hair down to her ass, and her waist is this big around.\u201d I touched my index and thumb claws. \u201cThey are engaged to be engaged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe brought her here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe sat in that chair right there.\u201d I pointed at the other client chair. \u201cI\u2019m thinking of burning it.\u201d</p><p>Kate put the bottle down. \u201cDid you punch him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d I took a long swig. The alcohol burned my tongue. \u201cAfter he told me that his new sweetheart\u2019s best quality is that she isn\u2019t me, it didn\u2019t seem like it would make any difference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she a shapeshifter?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cA human. Not a fighter. Not that bright either. I know what you\u2019ll say\u2014it\u2019s my own fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you did check out of his life,\u201d Kate said. \u201cYou checked out of my life for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah.\u201d I took a deep breath. There was no action to displace the pain now. No escape. The ache settled in my chest and scraped at me with sharp little claws.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to fight for him?\u201d Kate asked.</p><p>I looked at her. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to fight for him, or are you going to roll over on your back and take it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook who\u2019s talking. How long did it take you and Curran to have a conversation after that whole dinner mess? Was it three weeks or more like a month?\u201d</p><p>Kate arched her left eyebrow. \u201cThat\u2019s different. That was a misunderstanding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAha.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe brought his new main squeeze here after you called him with a peace offering. That\u2019s a slap in the face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to tell me that. I know.\u201d I growled, deep in my throat. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo what are you going to do about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t decided yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing is free,\u201d Kate said. \u201cIf you want it, you have to fight for it.\u201d</p> <p>Coming from a woman who had fought off twenty-two shapeshifters to stay by Curran\u2019s side, that was a statement based on experience.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking about it.\u201d Thinking if I wanted to fight for Raphael. What he did to me was cruel. I hurt and I wanted revenge more than anything else. But at the same time, who was I to stand in the way of his new happiness? Whatever Rebecca was giving him, he clearly needed it, otherwise he wouldn\u2019t have made plans for their engagement. \u201cHow did your day go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got some head. It was vamp, but still.\u201d</p><p>I stared at her. Kate was the last person I would have expected to make that joke. Well, someone had loosened up since mating. \u201cThat good, huh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have a glass monster corpse for you. It\u2019s in the freezer.\u201d</p><p>Kate grinned a deranged smile. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a bribe for putting up with my psychotic break.\u201d</p><p>A car engine roared outside.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my ride,\u201d Kate said.</p><p>The door swung open, and Curran shouldered his way in. Muscular, built like he fought for his life every day\u2014which wasn\u2019t too far from the truth\u2014Curran moved like a beast who knew he was at the top of the food chain. When he walked into a room, he owned it and you knew that if you disagreed, he would prove it to you. Judging by the blood spatter on his T-shirt, he had done it today already.</p> <p>I rose. It\u2019s polite to afford monarchy its due. If you don\u2019t, they get royally pissy.</p><p>Curran\u2019s thick blond eyebrows furrowed. We didn\u2019t really get along that well, mainly because I complicated his life. A good portion of the older shapeshifters believed in killing beastkin, and my existence meant he would have to resolve this prejudice sooner or later. On top of that I was a shapeshifter and I wasn\u2019t in the Pack. He managed to ignore this fact, probably because Kate and I were best friends. However, I had spent the whole day galloping around the city in my beastkin shape. Ignoring me was no longer an option.</p><p>Kate stepped next to him and kissed him. He turned to her, focusing on her completely, as if they were alone in the room. That\u2019s what mating meant. It stabbed at me a little. There was a time I\u2019d had that, too.</p><p>\u201cHold on, let me grab the vamp head.\u201d Kate went into the back.</p><p>The Beast Lord looked at me. \u201cI see you\u2019ve decided who you want to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m working on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you in a couple of days, then.\u201d</p><p>If I didn\u2019t present myself in three days or make some sort of arrangement to do so, he would take it as an open challenge. To present myself, I would have to swallow my pride, put aside the memories of my tormented childhood, and go back to Aunt B, a bouda and the woman I had slapped. The woman who had sent two boudas to thrash me. I would have to bow my head and apologize and ask to be admitted into her clan.</p> <p>I\u2019d rather eat dirt.</p><p>\u201cI hope so,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cThe Pack isn\u2019t so bad, Andrea,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cAnd loyalty goes both ways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I said. \u201cI just...I feel like I failed.\u201d What the hell was I doing having a heart-to-heart with the Beast Lord? \u201cI worked so hard at my previous life. Joining the Pack is the last nail in that coffin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only thing you failed at was pretending to be something you\u2019re not. And you got away with it for a very long time.\u201d Curran shrugged his shoulders. \u201cNobody in the Pack will judge you for what you are or whose daughter you are. You have my word on it.\u201d</p><p>Ascanio emerged into the room and bowed his head. Normally either Kate or Derek gave Ascanio a ride. He couldn\u2019t be trusted with his own vehicle. Today he had the privilege of Curran\u2019s company. I didn\u2019t envy him the car ride home.</p><p>Kate came out of the kitchen, carrying a plastic sack. She waved at me and the three of them went into the night, closing the door behind them. The car pulled away.</p><p>I was all alone.</p><p>I sat down and drained half a bottle of my Georgia Peach Tea in a single long swallow.</p><p>To rewrite my life, I had to own all of the choices I\u2019d made and deal with their consequences. I could take off and start over somewhere else. It would be easier. So much easier than bending my knee to my new bitch alpha and seeing Raphael and his happy bride at every clan gathering.</p><p>I laughed at the thought. It sounded too bitter and I stopped and headed to the shower instead. The night was still young. It was barely past six-thirty. I could get cleaned and sift through my evidence some more.</p><p>From the moment I was born, I learned that I had two choices: to fight or die. I wasn\u2019t the dying type. Atlanta would respect me. The Pack would value me. And Raphael...Well, Raphael would come to regret replacing me, because I would prove to him that I was a much better choice.</p><p>CHAPTER 6</p><p>I awoke in the closet again.</p><p>I kicked off my blanket in disgust. I\u2019d dreamt of being beaten. The memory of the dream fluttered in front of me, still vivid. It was my eleventh birthday, and the older boudas had chased me into an old farm equipment store. I\u2019d hid in a metal drum trough, the kind used to feed the pigs. They\u2019d found me, poured kerosene into the drum, and set me on fire.</p><p>I remembered the smell of my hair burning.</p><p>I pulled my knees to my chest. My dream wasn\u2019t just a nightmare; it was an actual memory. I had spent years trying to suppress it, but the stress and all the talking with Ascanio must\u2019ve caused it to resurface in my subconscious. I reached over and touched the closet wall to remind myself the dream was over. The sleek paint felt cold to my fingers. Since I made such frequent visits here, maybe I should just move in. Install a toilet, a sink, build myself a nest...heh.</p><p>The day was starting outside. It was time to get on with it. I needed to get dressed and visit Anapa\u2019s office. In my human shape. At least the magic was down. If I got irritated, I\u2019d shoot my way out of it.</p><p>I left the closet. Outside my window, past the bars, thick gray clouds clogged the sky, promising rain. Against that faded backdrop, the crumpled husks of once-tall buildings hunkered down, dark and twisted, tinseled with green plants stubbornly trying to conquer the crumbling city. On the fringes of the business district graveyard, new construction sprouted, stout buildings of wood and stone, no more than four stories high and built by skilled masons. Human hands, no machines.</p><p>In the distance, police sirens wailed. Just another fun morning in post-Shift Atlanta.</p><p>I stood in front of the mirror in the bathroom. The woman who looked back at me seemed sharper than she\u2019d been yesterday. Meaner. Stronger. Too rough around the edges for most of the things in my wardrobe. Normally I wore jeans, khakis, off-white shirts. Neat professional attire, meant to inspire confidence and communicate safety to prospective petitioners for the Order\u2019s assistance. The motto was confident but nonthreatening.</p><p>I was done with being nonthreatening. There had to be something in my closet that fit the new me.</p><p>Input Enterprises had a southeast address, on Phoenix Street. Despite the ruined condition of the neighboring blocks, this street was clean of garbage and refuse, brand-new houses lining both sides like soldiers on parade. There must\u2019ve been some serious money behind that rebuilding project, because the houses had been tastefully embellished with cornices and decorative brackets. Even the bars on the bay windows were stylishly ornamental, with metal squiggly shapes. The area clearly was making an attempt at becoming a respectable business district.</p><p>I parked the Jeep in a small lot and walked, looking at the building numbers. The overcast sky finally decided to cry on my shoulder. The rainwater turned the asphalt dark. It was good that I wore a hat.</p><p>When I found the right number, instead of a building I saw a stone arch with a sign that read INPUT ENTERPRISES on the wall, complete with an arrow pointing inside the arch. Fine.</p><p>I walked through the long narrow tunnel and emerged into a wide space. A large patio stretched in front of me, all sand-colored stone, with vegetation confined to narrow rectangular flower beds, running in two lines toward the building in the back. The structure rose three stories high, but the three floors were oversized, pushing the height of the building to a dangerous level. Another foot or two and magic would take notice of it.</p><p>The main part of the structure was all modern office: glass, steel, and pristine white stone combined into a sleek elegant whole. The top of the building suddenly broke with the plan and turned into a cupola of glass and crisscrossing metal beams with a golden sheen.</p><p>I walked through the front doors. A polished tile floor rolled from where I stood to the marble counter, manned by a receptionist. She was in her early twenties, her makeup was heavy, her suit powder blue, and her pale brown hair was arranged in a picture-perfect French twist. Behind her a large banner affixed to the wall, golden letters on black, read, HAPPY BIRTHDAY, BOSS!</p><p>I walked across the tiled floor. The receptionist looked up and did a double take. I wore a light brown duster. I had left it open in the front, and it showed off my blue jeans, combat boots, black T-shirt, and twin Sigs in the hip holsters. An old cowboy hat sat on my hair.</p><p>I stopped by the counter, tipped my hat, and drawled in my native tongue. \u201cHowdy, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>The receptionist blinked. \u201cEhhh, hello.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here to see Mr. Anapa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have an appointment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m investigating a murder on behalf of the Pack.\u201d I handed her my PI ID.</p><p>The receptionist gave me a practiced smile and nodded at the low couches on the right. \u201cPlease take a seat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. So boss is having a birthday? Is he throwing a party?\u201d Raphael had mentioned getting an invitation. It nagged at me so I thought I\u2019d check it out.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s tonight,\u201d the secretary informed me.</p><p>Ha. Either my guns had made an impression, or nobody had explained to her that she was not supposed to give strange women confidential information. Most receptionists would\u2019ve told me to shove off. \u201cWonderful. How old is he?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cForty-two.\u201d</p><p>I went to the couches and sat. Minutes trickled by, slow and boring.</p><p>A quiet creaking of plastic wheels rolling came from the hallway. A man emerged\u2014Latino, late fifties, early sixties. He pushed a bright yellow industrial mop bucket and he walked slowly, his eyes tired, his shoulders sloping forward. Probably part of the night cleaning crew, wrapping up his shift. As he passed the counter, the receptionist cleared her throat.</p> <p>He glanced at her.</p><p>\u201cThere is a mess in the second-floor kitchenette,\u201d she said. \u201cSomeone spilled coffee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy shift was over half an hour ago,\u201d the man said.</p><p>She stared at him. My opinion of Anapa\u2019s reception staff plummeted. How difficult was it to clean up your own coffee spill? Get a rag and mop it up. If the man\u2019s shift was over, let him go home.</p><p>He heaved his shoulders. \u201cFine. I\u2019ll get it.\u201d</p> <p>I watched him roll away. The building lay quiet again.</p><p>I studied the stone tile: golden brown with slight charcoal and russet undertones. Beautiful. Raphael had a similar type of tile installed in his place. I could never understand the man\u2019s aversion to carpet. His house looked like a castle: stone tile on the floor, beige and gray wall paint, Azul Aran gray granite countertops. He\u2019d actually hired an artist to come in and paint stone blocks on the foyer\u2019s walls. Cost him an arm and a leg, but it looked awesome, especially once I bought him a pothos vine and installed some tiny hooks to keep it growing in the right direction. He also hung bladed weapons on the walls.</p><p>I could picture him as a hidalgo, ruling some grand castle like Alcazar, dressed all in black. My imagination conjured up Raphael, his muscular body hugged by a black doublet, leaning against a stone balcony, a long rapier on his waist...with a seven-foot-tall blond bimbo by his side.</p><p>I had to stop obsessing. It was like my mind was stuck on him\u2014every moment I wasn\u2019t actively thinking about the case, my thoughts went right back to Raphael. Sometimes I plotted revenge, sometimes I felt like hitting my head against the wall. These bouts of feeling sorry for myself and daydreaming ways of making him regret he was ever born had to stop.</p><p>My ears caught the sound of distant footsteps. I rose. Three people strode out of the hallway, a trim woman in a beige business suit in the lead. She wore glasses and her light brown hair had been braided away from her face. Her clothes and hair said \u201cbusiness.\u201d Her posture and eyes said \u201ccombat operative.\u201d A man and a woman in tactical gear and dark clothes brought up the rear, holding cop batons. Each sported a sidearm on the hip.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Ms. Nash,\u201d the woman said, her voice crisp. \u201cMr. Anapa sends his regrets. His schedule is full and he\u2019s unable to see you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m investigating murders on behalf of the Pack,\u201d I said. \u201cI only have a few questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Anapa will be very busy this entire week,\u201d the woman said.</p><p>\u201cHe isn\u2019t a suspect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhether you suspect him or not is irrelevant. You\u2019re no longer a member of law enforcement. You\u2019re here as a private citizen. Please leave our premises.\u201d She turned, squaring off with me.</p><p>If I\u2019d still had my Order ID, I\u2019d have made her swallow those words. I considered my options. I could go through the two guards, but the faux secretary would provide a problem. The way she kept measuring the distance between the two of us telegraphed some sort of martial arts training, and her stance, square and straight on, said law enforcement experience. She was trained to wear body armor. Most shooters would blade their body sideways, minimizing the target area. People in bulletproof vests tended to face the danger.</p><p>Law enforcement meant she knew the rules and understood exactly what I could and couldn\u2019t get away with. If I made a scene and got in to see Anapa, she\u2019d sound the alarms and the cops would be on me like wolves on a lame deer. I could see the headline now: \u201cShapeshifter terrorizes local businessman.\u201d</p><p>A part of me, the bouda part, wanted to do it.</p><p>I had to back off. She knew it and I knew it. \u201cI\u2019ll be back,\u201d I told her.</p> <p>\u201cBring a cop with a warrant,\u201d she said.</p><p>I reached the door.</p><p>\u201cMs. Nash!\u201d she called.</p><p>I turned. The \u201csecretary\u201d smiled. \u201cThis lobby isn\u2019t big enough for the two of us, Ms. Nash.\u201d</p><p>I shot her with my index finger. \u201cI\u2019ll remember you said that.\u201d</p><p>Outside, the cloud cover had broken. I squinted at the sunlight and turned to examine the building. Anapa didn\u2019t want to be questioned, but that didn\u2019t make him guilty. It might just make him an ass. Except that I\u2019d questioned hundreds of suspects over the years and this was far from a typical reaction. Usually when you walked up to a place of business and told the employees that you were investigating a murder, natural curiosity took over and everyone gathered around to find out more. People are voyeurs and most of us are fascinated by morbid things. You tell someone, \u201cI\u2019m investigating a murder,\u201d the next question is usually, \u201cWho died?\u201d Anapa\u2019s receptionist had asked no questions. Neither had Anapa\u2019s knight in beige business armor.</p><p>The beige business suit woman must\u2019ve taken the time to research my background to punch me with that \u201cyou\u2019re no longer a member of law enforcement\u201d bit. True, the Order had retired me, but before that my career was distinguished and nothing in my resume indicated that I gave up easily. She didn\u2019t strike me as the type who missed details. It would have been so simple for Anapa to chat with me for ten minutes and clear his name. He would be off my suspect list and I would go away and stop bothering him. But he used his security people to chase me off instead. All sorts of alarming flags popped right up. Why all the secrecy?</p><p>When I was training, my instructor, a grizzled and scarred ex-detective named Shawna, taught me to eliminate suspects rather than look for them. Look at your suspect pool, pick a most likely one, and try to prove that he didn\u2019t do it.</p><p>Right now that process of elimination had excluded only Bell. Anapa still remained on my possible perp roster, and now he had managed to bump himself right to the top of my suspect list.</p><p>I surveyed the building. Barred windows, surveillance cameras\u2014which would work only during tech\u2014and, if the rest of the security was anything to go by, probably really good wards on the windows. As a shapeshifter, I had a natural resistance to wards, but breaking one would really hurt and create enough magic resonance to make anyone in the building with an iota of magic sensitivity scream bloody murder.</p><p>I circled the building. On the north side, a small window three floors up had no bars. The security cameras were also conveniently positioned to cover other approaches. I stood for a while and watched them turn. Sure enough, the pattern of the cameras offered about twenty seconds of undetectable approach to the building. They\u2019d built a trap into their defenses. I chuckled to myself. Clever. Not clever enough, but it would fool your average idiot.</p><p>I had to get close to Anapa. He refused to see me, his building was well defended and likely booby-trapped, and I didn\u2019t have the legal leverage to force him to meet with me.</p><p>The door opened and the older Latino man exited, minus his mop bucket. He squinted at the sky, a long-suffering look on his face, sighed, and started toward the street. I followed him at a discreet distance. We passed through the stone arch, turned onto the sidewalk, and I sped up, catching up with him.</p><p>\u201cYou need something?\u201d</p><p>I held up a twenty. Stuck in your investigation? Don\u2019t have a badge? Offer people money. That\u2019s just how we roll.</p><p>\u201cTell me about Anapa and his office?\u201d</p><p>The man looked at my twenty. \u201cI\u2019d take your money, but there isn\u2019t much to tell.\u201d</p><p>I nodded at the small restaurant on the other side of the street, with a sign that said RISE &amp; SHINE. \u201cIt\u2019s raining. Let me buy you a breakfast and a cup of coffee.\u201d</p><p>We got inside and sat in a booth. The waitress brought us hot coffee. I ordered four eggs and my new friend ordered some doughnuts. We both stayed away from sausage. Unless you knew the restaurant well and trusted the cook, ordering ground meat was a bad idea, because for some places \u201cbeef\u201d was a code for rat meat.</p><p>The coffee was fresh, at least.</p><p>\u201cSo tell me about Anapa.\u201d</p><p>The man shrugged. \u201cHe isn\u2019t there much. He comes in and out when he feels like it. I only seen him three or four times. Good suit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s his office?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThird floor, north side. There isn\u2019t much there. I clean dust from his desk once a week.\u201d</p><p>Interesting. \u201cWhat about his employees?\u201d</p><p>The man shrugged. \u201cThere are about twenty or so of them. It\u2019s a sham.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe company is a sham. It\u2019s like a bunch of kids got together, bought good clothes, and pretend to play at being businesspeople. They sit, they talk, they drink coffee and have lunches. Once a week, when the boss shows up, they all line up by his office to make him feel important. But not that much work is getting done.\u201d</p><p>The waitress brought our food and left. It started raining again outside our window.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He bit his doughnut. \u201cPaper. They don\u2019t use any. A working business like that makes paper waste. You know, copies, notes, shredded documents, empty boxes from office supplies they order. I work for a janitorial company. I have other clients on my route that have staff half Input\u2019s size. They make three, four times Input\u2019s paper waste. I go into Input\u2019s copy room, their waste bins are empty. Two-thirds of the time I don\u2019t have to touch them. This week was my biggest trash haul to date for them, and that\u2019s because they sent a memo out about Anapa\u2019s birthday.\u201d He finished his doughnut. \u201cThey do send packages to his house sometimes by a personal courier. I\u2019ve seen receipts from it in the receptionist\u2019s trash. Thanks for the food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for the information.\u201d</p><p>He left. I ate all the yolks out of my eggs and poked the eggs whites with my fork. If the man was right, then whatever business Anapa actually did took place from his house. Well, there was one way to check on that. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I waited until the waitress came by with the check, paid for my meal, and let her see that I was leaving a nice tip. \u201cGot an odd question for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat day do garbage men empty the Dumpsters on this street?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFriday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>It was Wednesday. The Input Dumpster should be almost full. I took myself and my duster out into the rain, walked back to the Input building, and circled it. A narrow alley led from the back of the building\u2019s lot to a larger street. Two Dumpsters sat in the alley, against a brick wall, one blue, one green. I flipped open the lids. Since the intrusion of magic made the mass production of plastic a thing of the past, all trash had to be divided and sorted. Food garbage was packed into wooden barrels or recycled metal drums, set in the green Dumpster, and picked up by composters. The recyclable waste\u2014wood and metal\u2014was simply thrown into the blue Dumpster, together with paper waste packed into burlap sacks.</p><p>Input\u2019s green Dumpster had a single drum, half-filled with remnants of rotting lunches. The blue Dumpster contained a sad, half-deflated burlap sack. I ruffled through it. Lots of copies of the memo about Anapa\u2019s party, some crumpled doodles, most featuring boobs of various sizes and an ugly but exceptionally endowed man doing X-rated things to said boobs, and a legal pad half soaked with coffee.</p><p>I abandoned the garbage and headed back to Rise &amp; Shine.</p> <p>I had to get into Anapa\u2019s house.</p><p>The solution to the dilemma appeared in my mind.</p><p>No. No, there had to be some other way. Any other way.</p><p>Any way at all.</p><p>Anything would do.</p><p>I clenched my teeth. It didn\u2019t help me produce any brilliant alternatives.</p> <p>Fine.</p><p>I walked into the restaurant, offered them ten bucks to use their phone, and called the office. Ascanio answered.</p><p>\u201cCutting Edge Investigations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t take me with you this morning,\u201d he said. \u201cI was good yesterday.\u201d</p><p>Oh bother. \u201cAscanio, you can\u2019t come with me every time. Any news for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s an autopsy report from Doolittle,\u201d he said. \u201cRaphael called.\u201d</p><p>Think of the devil. \u201cWhat did he want?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe asked when you\u2019re going to release the building site crime scene to his crew, because \u2018that damn cat\u2019 won\u2019t let him do anything until you say it\u2019s okay and he isn\u2019t \u2018made of money.\u2019 Could\u2019ve fooled me. I told him you were out, and he asked who with, and I told him that I wasn\u2019t at liberty to say. Then he chewed me out.\u201d</p><p>Christ. Just what I needed. \u201cDid he leave a number?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said he\u2019s at his main office. Also that guy from the service station yesterday found the check he received for towing that woman\u2019s car. He says if you come by his place after five, he\u2019ll give it to you. He said to bring the money.\u201d</p><p>Well, it was thin but at least it was something. \u201cPlease open Doolittle\u2019s report and look for the estimated time of death.\u201d</p><p>The phone went silent. I tapped my fingers on the counter.</p><p>\u201cBetween two and four a.m.,\u201d Ascanio said.</p><p>\u201cAnd the cause of death?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeath resulted from anaphylactic shock due to a snakebite. Symptoms included respiratory failure, multisystem organ failure, and acute renal failure...What does severe ecchymosis mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means subcutaneous accumulation of blood. Thanks.\u201d I hung up and dialed Raphael\u2019s number.</p><p>\u201cRaphael.\u201d</p><p>His voice took me to all sorts of places I didn\u2019t want to go. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough you brought your floozy to my office, now you\u2019re hassling my intern.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIntern, huh. Just what is he learning under you?\u201d</p><p>Really? He really went there? \u201cAre you alright? First, you replace me with a bimbo, now you\u2019re feeling threatened by a fifteen-year-old boy? Did something happen to give you an inferiority complex?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat boy has a long resume of sleeping with adult women and you looked a bit desperate the last time I saw you.\u201d</p><p>I pictured myself reaching through the phone and slapping him off his chair. \u201cThank you for your concern, but have no fear. I prefer men, not boys. That\u2019s why I\u2019m not with you anymore.\u201d</p><p>He snarled into the phone.</p><p>\u201cTemper, temper, sweet pea.\u201d Sweet pea? Where did that one even come from? \u201cI understand that your upcoming engagement will set you back quite a bit and you are in dire need of money, so you need me to release the crime scene.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have money! I need the site released because it\u2019s a waste of everyone\u2019s time for it to sit there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo conditions,\u201d I said. \u201cOne, all items from the vault are to be stored in the Keep until the end of this investigation. I\u2019ve catalogued them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDone,\u201d Raphael said. \u201cWill send them in under an armed convoy during tech. Two?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou still have that invitation to Anapa\u2019s birthday bash tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs the invitation for you and a friend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to be that friend.\u201d</p><p>Raphael paused. \u201cYou like Anapa for the murders?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPossibly. I tried his office. They wouldn\u2019t let me through the door. He\u2019s got a bulldog in a business suit on staff and she didn\u2019t buy my sweet smile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean you showed her your guns and she didn\u2019t faint?\u201d</p><p>Ha-ha-ha. \u201cNo, honey, you\u2019re the only one who does that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I recall, it was usually the other way around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen plenty of guns. You have a nice one, but it didn\u2019t make me faint.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you say now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRaphael, I don\u2019t own this phone. Don\u2019t make me break it, because I just gave up my last ten bucks to use it.\u201d</p><p>His voice was sweet as honey. \u201cDarling, do you need me to loan you some money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have never in my life needed you to loan me money. If I was dead, and the ferryman needed a coin to take me across the river to the afterlife, and you had the only quarter in existence, I\u2019d tell you to stick it up your ass.\u201d</p><p>People looked at me. This wasn\u2019t going well.</p><p>\u201cAndrea...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe next words out of your mouth better be work-related or I\u2019ll drive to your office and shoot you in the gut. Repeatedly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy in the gut?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s painful and not life threatening.\u201d He was a shapeshifter; he\u2019d heal the bullet wounds.</p><p>He laughed. He actually laughed at me on the phone. My head was about to explode.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you want to meet Anapa?\u201d Raphael asked.</p><p>\u201cMeeting him is secondary to sneaking into his office and looking through whatever dirty laundry he might be keeping in there. Someone had to have known about that vault, because it wasn\u2019t a random robbery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? And here I was thinking random robbers strolled by a deep dark hole guarded by people who grow four-inch claws and decided, \u2018Hey, I think I\u2019ll go in there and steal things.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Bastard. \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing that you are so pretty, because you sure aren\u2019t smart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI run a clan and a God damn business,\u201d he growled. \u201cI\u2019m smart enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, yes.\u201d Raphael\u2019s outrageous hotness was his downfall. People rarely took him seriously at first glance. Instead of listening to the smart things coming out of his mouth, men dismissed him as a pretty face and women concentrated on not drooling. I heard many things said out of his earshot: a player, high-maintenance, beefcake, yummy, and so on. Ruthless businessman and lethal fighter weren\u2019t usually the labels people arrived at until they got to know him better. It was a costly mistake to make. A few weeks ago one of Aunt B\u2019s enforcers forgot that and decided to insult him. Raphael retaliated in kind and she lost her head and attacked him. He landed three killing wounds before she even hit the ground.</p><p>Raphael was silent. Probably seething on the other end. This wasn\u2019t getting us anywhere.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to fight,\u201d I said, keeping my voice professional. \u201cI just want to solve this murder. I know this is difficult for us both. Let\u2019s go back to the killers. They came in prepared, they killed your people, and they knew how to open the vault. All that implies prior knowledge and resources. It is very likely that one of the three reclamation companies who bid on that building had something to do with it. I\u2019ve eliminated Bell as a suspect. The Garcias are a dead end for now\u2014something might pan out there and I\u2019ll know more by tonight, but as of this moment, their work site is abandoned and has been for a few weeks. That leaves Anapa. How much paper waste does Medrano Reclamations generate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough for the city to charge us for commercial pickup,\u201d Raphael growled.</p><p>\u201cInput produces almost nothing. Tomorrow is their garbage day and their Dumpster has half a sack of paper trash, most of it lewd drawings. I talked to a janitor, and he thinks their business is a sham. Apparently Anapa operates out of the office in his house. I don\u2019t like this any more than you do, but his party is my chance to take a look at him and search his office. Believe me, I would rather eat broken glass than go with you anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d he said, his voice dry.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a black-tie affair.\u201d</p><p>Of course it was. \u201cBlack-tie like my blue dress?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe ruined the blue dress, remember?\u201d he said. \u201cWe were having sex on the bed and knocked the bottle of cabernet onto it?\u201d</p><p>I flashed back right to that sunny afternoon. We had wanted to go to dinner, and I had laid the blue dress on the bed, and then Raphael brought a bottle of wine to the bedroom and did his Raphael thing, and we ended up on the bed ourselves, with the dress on the floor.</p><p>Anger bubbled up inside me, mixing with sadness, and a sick feeling that I was falling and falling, and somewhere below, a hard bottom waited for me. I was angry with Raphael. I was angry with myself. I wanted to bite someone or something. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Damn it. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll come up with something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pick you up at seven,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cMuch obliged,\u201d I drawled.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t do your Texas thing on me; it won\u2019t work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve done my thing on you and you quite liked it at the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot nearly as much as you liked what we did after.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t answer and neither did he. We just sat there, with the phone line between us. We had to stop doing this to each other.</p><p>\u201cRaphael, there is something else I wanted to mention. I meant to tell you this yesterday morning, but the appearance of your fianc\u00e9e knocked me off my stride. From talking to Stefan, I understand there were six people besides you who were there when the vault was discovered.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know where you\u2019re going,\u201d Raphael said, \u201cand I can tell you right now, none of them would betray me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen this will be very easy. Help me eliminate them. I need to account for every moment of their time from the instant they left the site until four a.m. If they made phone calls, we need to know. If they went to a bar and talked to someone, we need to know. You know them best and I would rather you do it, because my hands are full.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStefan needs to be checked out, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said I would take care of it.\u201d</p><p>He would. Raphael was infuriatingly thorough when he wanted to be. \u201cI\u2019ll see you tonight, then.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>Bastard. \u201cSeven o\u2019clock. Be there or your site will stay closed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do understand that if we get caught, the Pack will be blamed. The PAD isn\u2019t going to bother with subtleties like you not being an official member of the Pack or that we\u2019re investigating a murder. They\u2019ll see it as two shapeshifters burglarizing the house. We\u2019re disenfranchised enough as is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m aware of that, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust thought I\u2019d remind you,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI appreciate your concern.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect.\u201d</p> <p>I hung up. I felt like taking a cold shower. The clock on the wall behind the counter showed twelve minutes past ten. I had until three p.m. to find a dress and read through Doolittle\u2019s report. Then I\u2019d go to see the mechanic with a check from the mysterious woman and her towed car.</p><p>Since I was near a shopping district, I tackled the dress first. When you are short and curvy, your choice of dresses is limited. I had decent breasts, muscular calves, and strong, pretty legs. There was a magic point about two to three inches above my knee, where dresses and skirts looked great on me. Anything else had to be floor length, because people generally looked at me from above, and lengths in between made my legs look shorter and wider. Styles that made my neck look shorter than it already was, like bateau and collar necklines, were right out. On top of that, dresses with a bold pattern or bright mix of colors completely swallowed me, overwhelming my pale face and blond hair.</p><p>When I needed formal wear, I usually shopped at Deasia\u2019s, a family-owned shop ran by Deasia Randall. The owner, a stern-looking black woman in her mid-fifties, had impeccable taste.</p><p>After an hour at Deasia\u2019s, I\u2019d tried all of the usual suspects: teal, peach, blue...I even tried a chartreuse, which made me look like a barrel dyed in pea soup. Things that should have looked good on me, because they always had, suddenly didn\u2019t.</p><p>Deasia examined me with the critical eye honed by thirty years of fashion experience. \u201cWhat is the dress for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor a formal birthday party at a millionaire\u2019s house.\u201d And I had to look presentable enough to get through the door.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s escorting you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy ex-boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>Deasia\u2019s eyebrows rose. \u201cAh. Mystery solved. Has he moved on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you want to make an impression?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to knock his socks off. I want him to see that I\u2019m just fine on my own. I want to be vibrant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVibrant or shocking?\u201d Deasia asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take shocking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait here.\u201d</p><p>She disappeared between the racks of clothes. I surveyed my latest attempt. A violet, high-waisted number should have been flattering, but it wasn\u2019t. My face had changed, too. I used to be able to pull off fresh and even sweet. The woman who looked at me now looked good in a duster and a pair of guns. Draping pretty purple fabric on me was like coating a razor blade in a Skittles candy shell.</p><p>Deasia reappeared, carrying a hanger with something black and lacy.</p><p>\u201cI appreciate it, but black is not me,\u201d I said. \u201cIt washes me out.\u201d</p><p>Deasia fixed a junkyard dog stare on me. \u201cTry it.\u201d</p><p>I took the dress and went to the dressing room. I took the purple monstrosity off and pulled the black dress off the hanger. Black lace over black fabric. Not me. I slipped the black dress on, stepped out, and looked into the three-paneled full-length mirror.</p><p>The black dress hugged me like a glove, stopping about three inches above my knee. Solid black below the waist, the asymmetric gown climbed up diagonally across my chest, over my left shoulder. The left side had a tiny sleeve, but the right shoulder was shockingly bare. A long serpentine shape of a Chinese dragon was cut into the black fabric of the dress. Its head rested on the left side of my chest, its long body slithering between my breasts, just a hair too narrow to be indecent, curving to the right, and sliding down my right thigh. Black, jagged lace overlaid the dragon\u2019s outline, its pattern mimicking the dragon\u2019s scales, giving a sexy glimpse of my bare skin. A single red stone marked the dragon\u2019s eye and as I turned, it shone with the pure ruby glow of a bouda\u2019s eyes.</p><p>Black had never been my color, but it was today.</p><p>Deasia set a pair of black pumps in front of me. I stepped into them, picking up four inches of height.</p><p>Holy shit. I looked aggressive. \u201cThis is an evil dress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvil can be beautiful,\u201d Deasia said. \u201cDon\u2019t over-accessorize. Pair of earrings, nothing too large, and maybe a bracelet. That\u2019s it. Oh, and this dress calls for a red mouth, Andrea. Scarlet red.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you will. Knock him dead.\u201d</p><p>Raphael wouldn\u2019t know what hit him. Neither would Anapa. And if any evidence of Anapa\u2019s connection to the deaths of the shapeshifters existed, I would do my best to find it.</p><p>When I walked into Cutting Edge\u2019s offices, a man was sitting in my client chair. He was bent over, doing something with his feet, and as he turned his head at my approach, I saw a car seat. A baby lay in it, a little spot of white and pink against the green fabric patterned with cartoon dinosaurs. The man\u2019s face seemed familiar. It took me a second, and then I placed it. Nick Moreau.</p><p>The last time I\u2019d seen him, in June, he\u2019d looked ten years younger. The man who sat in front of me now seemed old and tired, and when he gazed at me, his eyes were devoid of life, as if they had been covered with ash.</p><p>\u201cI told him you were out,\u201d Ascanio said, from the storeroom doorway. \u201cHe said he didn\u2019t mind waiting.\u201d</p><p>I sat in the other chair next to Nick. He ran his hand through his light brown hair.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my son,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s beautiful,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to hold him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay I?\u201d</p><p>Nick picked the baby up and put him in my arms. Baby Rory looked at me with dark gray eyes, puzzled and fascinated, his mouth slightly open. He was nearly bald, his hair a soft peach fuzz on his head. His eyelashes were a happy, sunny blond.</p><p>So tiny. Such a fragile little life.</p><p>\u201cHey there,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>Baby Rory looked at me and I could see no fear in his eyes. No sadness, no bitterness, nothing jaded. The world was a big wonderful toy and Baby Rory had no idea how badly it had hurt him. I wanted to wrap him in my arms and make it all be okay. I wanted to give him his mother back.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s beautiful,\u201d I told Nick again.</p><p>\u201cHis mother was, too,\u201d he said. \u201cHe can\u2019t even talk. He\u2019ll never remember her.\u201d</p><p>Baby Rory cooed and I hugged him to me, gently. How do you tell a baby his mother died? How do you even begin to explain why?</p><p>Nick reached inside his jacket, took out his wallet, and handed me a photograph. On it a woman smiled. Her hair was a mass of cinnamon curls around her face. Here was a pretty girl with freckles on her nose. Her file said she was twenty-six, only two years younger than me. She\u2019d had no idea, but Rianna Moreau had been living my dream. She had a husband who loved her without reservation. She had a fulfilling job she loved. She had Baby Rory. They were a family together and their future looked bright until some asshole came over and robbed them of it.</p><p>Nick\u2019s eyes watered. He squeezed his hand into a fist. \u201cHe won\u2019t know that she was kind. He\u2019ll know that she loved him because I\u2019ll tell him, but he will never feel that love. My son is barely born, and his life is already broken.\u201d</p><p>I wished I could say something, but nothing that would come out of my mouth would make his loss easier to bear.</p><p>Baby Rory made little noises, oblivious to his father\u2019s grief.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll never see my wife again.\u201d Nick\u2019s voice faltered. He pulled himself back. \u201cI want you to understand. I want you to know what they took from me. To me, she was everything. I can\u2019t even say her name anymore.\u201d</p><p>I reached over and rested my fingers on his clenched fist.</p><p>\u201cRaphael said you\u2019re the best. He said you would find them.\u201d Nick\u2019s gaze searched my face. If only I had the right words...</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a carpenter,\u201d I said. \u201cYou build beautiful things because that\u2019s what you do. Investigation is what I do. I live it and breathe it, I\u2019m trained for it, and I\u2019m damn good at it. Your wife is not a name on the report, Nick. You and your son, you aren\u2019t some meaningless statistic. Rianna is real, and so are the two of you. I know what you had and I know what it\u2019s like to lose it. I understand.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I saw the split second when Nick broke down: something in his eyes snapped, the line of his mouth sagged, and he cried.

I\u2019ll do everything I can to get you and your son your answers and your justice.\u201d</p><p>In the corner Ascanio stared at us, his eyes freaked out.</p> <p>Nick shook, rigid, his voice a low guttural growl with bits and pieces of words coming through. \u201c...Take her from me...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise you that when I find them, they will suffer,\u201d I told him. \u201cIt won\u2019t bring your wife back, but when we\u2019re done with them, they will never rob anyone else of their life again. You must stay strong, Nick. You must be strong for your son. He still has a father, a tough, fierce father who loves him, who will be there for him.\u201d</p><p>Gradually the shudders stopped. Nick pulled away from me, suddenly, as if just realizing that he had been crying. He picked up the child carrier. Baby Rory yawned.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll tell me when you know?\u201d Nick asked.</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d</p> <p>He went out the door. I slumped in my chair.</p><p>Ascanio came over and sat on my desk. \u201cMan, that was heavy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the other half of the job,\u201d I told him. \u201cYou are accountable to the victims of the crime you\u2019re investigating. You accept responsibility for it. They place their trust in you and they expect you to bring them justice. You must never forget that it\u2019s about people. It\u2019s about suffering and loss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sucks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCongratulations\u2014you\u2019re catching on.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cBut I thought you were supposed to be detached. So it\u2019s not personal.\u201d</p> <p>I sighed. \u201cYou can\u2019t let it get to you, because you still need to focus. You need some distance to be objective. But it\u2019s personal. It\u2019s always personal. You can\u2019t ever forget that there are people involved. You also can\u2019t let your compassion for the wronged cloud your judgment, because there are more important things at stake than getting Nick his vengeance.\u201d</p><p>Ascanio studied me. \u201cWhat can be more important than that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaking sure that the guilty never do it again. The people who killed Rianna and the other shapeshifters broke the most sacred of laws\u2014they murdered. Since they did it once, they will probably do it again. First and foremost, we have to make sure we keep them from destroying another life.\u201d</p><p>Ascanio pondered it. \u201cNick doesn\u2019t see it this way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNick doesn\u2019t need to. It\u2019s our job to worry about that, not his.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think he wanted you to tell him you would find the killer and solve the whole thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes he did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause I don\u2019t make promises I can\u2019t keep. Now get off my desk and bring me Doolittle\u2019s report.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 7</p><p>The good doctor\u2019s report confirmed what I\u2019d already known: the four shapeshifters, including Nick\u2019s wife, had died of snake poison. I had noted four different bite sizes on the bodies and Doolittle had found one more, which meant five sets of fangs and probably five assailants, unless our killer was a hydra. Or a gorgon. Not that anyone had ever seen a gorgon, but you never knew what fun atrocities magic would commit next.</p><p>The snakes were some sort of vipers, and based on Doolittle\u2019s learned opinion, the largest bite belonged to something with a head the size of a coconut and its poison was lethal to humans in tiny doses and shapeshifters in slightly larger ones. Besides the official report, the envelope contained a small scrap of paper that said, \u201cIf you find it, call me immediately. Do not attempt to confront the snake.\u201d</p><p>I wouldn\u2019t confront it. I would shoot it. Repeatedly.</p><p>Jim had run the fingerprints I took off the vault\u2019s door through the database. Out of eight sets, seven belonged to Raphael\u2019s crew. The eighth was a mystery. None of the databases had any hits.</p><p>The trace analysis wasn\u2019t much better. No smoking guns.</p><p>I sifted through the files. Raphael\u2019s crew was a tight-knit bunch, all Clan Bouda and their relatives. Family men and women, they stuck together. They visited the same places, they went to the same barbecues, and they babysat each other\u2019s children. Raphael was very selective in his hiring habits and he hadn\u2019t hired anyone new for eleven months, long before the Heron Building ever came on sale.</p><p>Of the fourteen people currently on the crew, six were mated, with both husband and wife working for Medrano Reclamations; three others were mated to someone else; two were children of other members of the crew; and the three remaining shapeshifters had worked with Raphael for years. They led quiet lives\u2014they worked, they came home, they spent time with their kids.</p><p>Jim\u2019s background check had found zip. This type of environment didn\u2019t exactly provide fertile ground for secret sins. Nobody was a degenerate gambler. Nobody borrowed money from unsavory sources. Nobody seemed to have room in their lives for blackmail, murder, and torrid affairs. And if an affair had occurred, their biggest worry would\u2019ve been their bouda spouses. Boudas were wild until they mated, but once the mating occurred, they went right into possessive, fiercely jealous territory. And their scandals were notoriously public. We loved drama.</p><p>I called around to the local MSDU to a buddy of mine. During my time with the Order, Ted had loaned me to the military a couple of times, and I had earned enough respect there to cash in a favor or two. Lena, my MSDU contact, ran a quick check on Anapa\u2019s criminal history for me. He had none. Either both he and his corporation were disgustingly law-abiding or he knew how to cover his tracks.</p><p>Finally I looked up and nodded at Ascanio. \u201cGet your gear.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed his knife. \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo the library.\u201d</p><p>His enthusiasm visibly deflated and he emitted a tragic sigh. \u201cBut \u2018library\u2019 and \u2018kick-ass\u2019 are two concepts that don\u2019t usually go together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the nature of the business. Five percent of the time you are killing monsters. The rest of the time, we\u2019re digging through the dirt for a tiny piece of the perpetrator\u2019s pubic hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUgh.\u201d</p><p>I was fighting on two fronts. One, he was a fifteen-year-old boy equipped with the body of a monster and flooded with hormones. He was desperate for an opportunity to let some steam out. Two, he was a bouda. We were an easily bored species. In nature hyenas relied on sight more than scent in their hunting. We didn\u2019t do dogged wolflike pursuit, we didn\u2019t travel single file, and we didn\u2019t typically track. Following the trail of breadcrumbs went against Ascanio\u2019s natural instinct. But as I\u2019ve pointed out to him before, the human part of him was doing the driving. I would prevail.</p><p>\u201cYou can always stay here and practice broom drills.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you,\u201d he said and produced a dazzling smile. The kid was something else. \u201cMay I drive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you may.\u201d I had to give him something as a consolation prize.</p><p>We locked the office and went on our way.</p><p>\u201cSo why are we going to the library?\u201d Ascanio asked.</p><p>I leaned back against my seat. \u201cDon\u2019t take Magnolia. Take Redberry instead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRedberry has some sort of weird yellow vines growing on the buildings. I want to check it out. To answer your question, we are going to the library because it\u2019s the only place accessible to the public where we can tap into the Library of Alexandria project.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYears ago\u2014before you were born\u2014people had access to a network of data called the Internet. If you needed an address, for example, you could type it into your computer and it would pop right up, with directions of how to get there. If you needed to look up something like the boiling point of hydrochloric acid, you could do that. Instant knowledge at your fingertips.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Well, when it became obvious that magic was going to wreck the computer networks, people tried to preserve portions of the Internet. They took snapshots of their servers and sent the data to a central database at the Library of Congress. The project became known as the Library of Alexandria, because in ancient times Alexandria\u2019s library was said to contain all human knowledge, before some jackass burned it to the ground. Since the tech is up, we\u2019re going to dig through that database.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are we digging for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFacts. Let\u2019s look at what we have. First, Raphael buys a highly contested building, leaving all other bidders in the dust. Then Raphael\u2019s crew finds a secret vault that wasn\u2019t in any of the documents they had. Someone went to Raphael\u2019s site, attacked the shapeshifters guarding it, and opened the vault. Then they left the site, leaving most of the vault\u2019s contents untouched. What does that tell you?\u201d</p><p>Ascanio frowned. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t random.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. There are easier places to rob and a guarded tunnel isn\u2019t like a bank. It doesn\u2019t automatically look like something valuable is hidden in it. Also a random robber would\u2019ve emptied the vault.\u201d</p><p>Ascanio looked at me. \u201cSo the thief had to know about the vault and what was in it.\u201d</p><p>There was hope for him yet. \u201cExactly. We have two avenues of investigation: one, find out who knew about the vault and could\u2019ve accessed it, and two?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFind out what they were after,\u201d Ascanio said.</p><p>I smiled at him. \u201cGood. We know that the building was owned by Jamar Groves. If the Blue Heron had a secret vault, Jamar had to know about it, because he was the one who had put it there. We know that Jamar Groves collected art and antiques. It\u2019s logical to suppose that the secret vault contained Jamar\u2019s personal stash. We also have the catalog of the vault\u2019s contents, which I made at the scene. We\u2019re going to search the archives for any mention of Jamar and his collection and compare it against the list of items in the vault.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ascanio arranged his pretty face into a martyred expression.</p><p>\u201cThe Central Library sits on the edge of Centennial Park,\u201d I told him. Over the years the park had exploded in size, swallowing additional city blocks, and the library was one of its victims.</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d Ascanio asked.</p> <p>\u201cCentennial Park is owned by the witch covens. They provide security for the library, because it is a depository of knowledge.\u201d</p><p>Ascanio came alive. \u201cFemale witches?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost of them, yes. If you work hard, I\u2019ll let you flirt.\u201d</p><p>The teenage bouda grinned.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get your hopes up,\u201d I told him. \u201cThe witch girls are pretty pragmatic.\u201d</p> <p>Ever since the Shift, the moment when our slow apocalypse in progress began, the plants had decided it was time to wage full-on assault on all things human. Magic fueled the tree growth, and Centennial Park was a shining example of that. In the decade since the Shift the park had tripled in size, taking over the neighboring city blocks. Once the Atlanta witch covens had purchased it from the city as their meeting place, the park had stopped expanding sideways, directing all of its growth upward instead. As we drove up, a dense wall of green greeted us, the tree trunks bound together with thorny vines, as if a three-hundred-year-old forest had somehow sprouted in the middle of the city.</p><p>The brown square building of the Central Library sat recessed in the green. A pair of massive ash trees hugged it on both sides, their branches and roots braiding together, sliding over the walls and sometimes through them, as if the library itself was some odd mushroom growing from their twin trunks. The trees sheltered the library and while its neighbors had long-ago fallen and crumbled, the library looked intact.</p><p>We parked in a large parking lot, which used to be Forsyth Street, and went to the doors. Inside, a young dark-haired girl, barely fifteen if that, stepped in our way. She carried a staff, wore jeans and a frilly white T-shirt, and the left side of her face sported a tattoo of some arcane symbols above her eyebrow and down over her cheekbone.</p><p>\u201cPlease surrender your weapons!\u201d she chirped in a high voice and nodded at the cart full of plastic bins.</p><p>Ascanio\u2019s eyes lit up.</p><p>I removed my Sig-Sauers and put them into a plastic bin. The two knives followed. I put my wolfsbane and a small flask of my silver powder into it.</p> <p>\u201cThank you!\u201d the witch said and looked at Ascanio.</p><p>The boy offered her his knife with a charming smile. \u201cHi! What\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy name is Put the Knife into the Bin, Please!\u201d</p><p>Ascanio deposited the knife into the bin and followed me.</p><p>\u201cGiving up?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cShe isn\u2019t interested,\u201d he said. \u201cCute, but not interested.\u201d</p><p>That was one thing I could honestly say about the Atlanta boudas: the men always understood the difference between no and maybe.</p><p>We crossed the floor to a heavy desk manned by a female librarian. She smiled at me. \u201cMay I help you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe need access to the Library of Alexandria.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you a member?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I would like to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAndrea?\u201d a familiar male voice said.</p><p>I turned. A tall, broad-shouldered man stood on the right, by the reference bookshelves, looking at me. He wore a black robe with silver embroidery along the hem and sleeves, fastened by a leather belt around his narrow waist. His jet-black hair was shaved on the sides of his head into a semblance of a horse\u2019s mane. His features were bold and harshly cut: he had a large aquiline nose, a square jaw, prominent cheekbones, and a full mouth that could be either sensual or cruel.</p><p>His eyebrows were black, and his eyes, full of humor, were black, too. He seemed to really like that color, which was understandable since he was a volhv, which was kind of like a Russian druid, and he worshipped Chernobog, a Slavic god of \u201cEverything Bad and Evil,\u201d as Kate once put it. If you looked in a dictionary under \u201cdark wizard,\u201d you\u2019d get his picture. Except he would be standing on a pile of skulls and holding a staff with magic fire shooting from it.</p><p>\u201cHi, Roman.\u201d</p><p>The volhv put his book down and walked over to us. I had to admit, the robe, the hair, and his height combined into a pretty menacing whole. He smiled, showing even white teeth. \u201cYou remembered my name.\u201d</p><p>He had one of the best male voices I\u2019d ever heard. Rich and resonant and just a touch suggestive. Or maybe I was reading too much into it. The first time I ever saw him, he was in a loup cage in our office, because he\u2019d attacked Kate and she didn\u2019t like it. He\u2019d made some comments to me, which could have been construed as flirting. In a dark, terrible wizard way.</p><p>I also remembered him having a Russian accent. Not a big one, but now he was talking like he\u2019d been born and raised in Atlanta. Maybe he had been.</p><p>\u201cStill the same outfit, I see. Do you ever change it up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn private,\u201d he said. \u201cMust maintain the whole \u2018knitted from darkness and shadow\u2019 image.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t darkness and shadow the same thing?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He wagged his eyebrows at me. \u201cAaah, you\u2019d think so, but no. Shadow implies the presence of light. I am not all bad, you see. Parts of me are good. In fact, parts of me are excellent.\u201d</p><p>Ascanio rolled his eyes behind him.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Roman said. \u201cWhat brings you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re trying to get access to the Library of Alexandria.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can help you. I\u2019ve got this, Rachel.\u201d Roman waved at us. \u201cFollow me.\u201d</p><p>We followed him up a tall gray and brown staircase. \u201cDo you come here often?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He rolled his dark eyes. \u201cI live in this bloody place. Dad\u2019s making me track down some obscure legend. The Witch Oracle foresaw some things a couple of weeks ago, and I\u2019ve been digging in ever since.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould you just tell him no?\u201d Ascanio asked from behind.</p><p>Roman glanced at him and heaved a dramatic sigh. \u201cMy father is the Black Volhv. My mother is one of the Witch Oracles. In my place, you have to ask yourself, is saying no worth the problems, the nagging, the accusations of not being a good son, the lectures from both of my parents, and the story of how my mother was in labor for forty hours, which I can recite from memory. It\u2019s easier to just do what they want. Besides, if the prophecy is the sign of something dreadful happening, we might as well be prepared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat sort of prophecy was it?\u201d Ascanio asked.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s classified.\u201d Roman winked at him. \u201cI could tell you, of course. But then I would have to kill you and chain your soul, so you would be my shadow servant for all eternity. Come on, it\u2019s right this way.\u201d</p><p>Roman turned left, between the bookcases, going deeper into the library\u2019s second floor.</p><p>Ascanio\u2019s eyes widened. He turned to me. \u201cCan he do that?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged my shoulders. \u201cI have no idea. Why don\u2019t you try bugging him, so we\u2019ll find out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo thanks.\u201d</p><p>Roman led us through the narrow tunnel between bookshelves all the way to the back of the library, where five terminals glowed weakly. He pulled a card out of his pocket and swiped it through the card reader of the two closest terminals. The Library of Alexandria logo\u2014a book encased in flame\u2014came on the screens.</p><p>\u201cHere you go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. Much obliged.\u201d It was really nice of him.</p><p>\u201cSay, can I ask you a question? In private?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d I pointed at the left terminal. \u201cAscanio, search for our boy. Remember, anything that has to do with his art collection.\u201d</p><p>We walked along the wall outside of Ascanio\u2019s hearing distance, which took us almost all the way to the end of the section.</p><p>Roman\u2019s dark eyes turned serious. \u201cYou have ties with the Pack, yes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome.\u201d</p><p>He frowned, looming next to me, all tall and dark. \u201cDid you hear anything...alarming? Anything about them taking over the city, for example?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It wouldn\u2019t happen anyway. Curran is a separatist,\u201d I told him. \u201cHe believes in maintaining a distance between the shapeshifters and everyone else. The Pack worships his footsteps. They wouldn\u2019t do anything without his say-so. Even if they did, how would they hold the place? Everyone else would unite and crush them and that\u2019s leaving aside any action the government would take.\u201d</p><p>Roman stroked his chin. \u201cTrue, true...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe prophecy. Some prophecies are distinct. This one wasn\u2019t. The witches saw a shadow falling on the city and then there was howling. Deafening, scary howling. They aren\u2019t sure if it\u2019s a dog or a wolf or something else. Also they saw a spiral of clay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what does it mean?\u201d</p><p>Roman shook his head. \u201cNo way to tell. It must\u2019ve felt terrifying, because my mother was rattled after it.\u201d</p><p>I had met Evdokia. Anything that managed to rattle her had to be treated as a serious threat.</p><p>\u201cAre you free tomorrow night?\u201d Roman asked. \u201cI\u2019d love your perspective on things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you asking me on a date?\u201d Flirting or not flirting?</p><p>Roman leaned one arm against the bookcase. \u201cWho, me? I don\u2019t date. I only steal virgins to sacrifice.\u201d</p><p>Flirting. Shamelessly flirting. \u201cHmm, then I\u2019m not of any interest to you. I\u2019m not a virgin.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cThis would be a professional meeting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAha.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKompletely profeshonal,\u201d Roman said, turning the Russian accent back on.</p><p>He was charming and funny and a bit scary, which was always a draw in my book. But every nerve in me still hurt. If there was one thing I\u2019d learned, it was that jumping from one relationship into another was a bad idea.</p><p>Still...my life didn\u2019t have to be tied with Raphael\u2019s. The world wasn\u2019t limited to one bouda jerk. Here was a guy, a funny, handsome guy, who probably thought I was hot. It could be someone like him. It could be no one, for that matter. I could be perfectly fine by myself. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m investigating four shapeshifter murders,\u201d I told him. \u201cHave you heard anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But I can ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, see, I\u2019m no good to you, because I\u2019m not a virgin and you are no good to me because you know nothing about the murders. Maybe some other time?\u201d</p> <p>He reached out to me. One second his hand was empty and the next a small black card with a white phone number appeared as if by magic. \u201cTake a card?\u201d he asked, winking. \u201cCome on, take one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill it sprout fangs when the magic hits?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t find out unless you take it.

He must\u2019ve gotten it from Kate.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ve got to go,\u201d I said.</p><p>Roman glanced up and said in a conspiratorial voice. \u201cIf I disappear in a dramatic pillar of black smoke, do you think the sprinklers will go off?\u201d</p><p>I leaned over to him and kept my voice low. \u201cProbably. But I\u2019m willing to close my eyes for a second and pretend you did anyway.\u201d</p> <p>I closed my eyes for a long moment and when I opened them, he was gone.</p><p>When I returned to the terminal, Ascanio handed me a notepad with notes. \u201cI found some articles. Also the volhv likes you,\u201d he said, his gaze fixed on the screen.</p><p>\u201cYes, he does.\u201d I scanned his notes. He\u2019d made a list of the art auctions Jamar had visited.</p><p>\u201cDoes this mean you\u2019re done with Raphael?\u201d</p><p>I gave him my sniper stare. \u201cIf you ever want to set foot out of the office again, you will stop taking an interest in my love life. It doesn\u2019t concern you.\u201d</p><p>He turned to me with an expression of remorse that could\u2019ve made the angels weep. \u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>How do you go from Baby Rory to Ascanio? To think that one day I might have kids, and given that I was half-bouda they would probably turn out just like him. The mind boggled.</p><p>\u201cIt says here Jamar bought a toilet seat for fifty thousand dollars,\u201d Ascanio said.</p> <p>I looked on the screen. \u201cIt says it\u2019s from Amarna, from the eighteenth dynasty of ancient Egypt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a toilet seat,\u201d Ascanio said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s four thousand years old.\u201d</p><p>He looked at me, incredulous. \u201cSome ancient Egyptians sat on it and took a dump.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI assume so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe paid fifty thousand dollars for a used toilet seat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe it was gold-plated,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cNo, it says here it\u2019s made of limestone, so if you were to use it, you\u2019d freeze your ass off when you sat on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not cold in Egypt. It\u2019s hot. Your grasp of geography is shaky, my friend.\u201d I sat down at a terminal next to him and typed \u201cJamar Groves\u201d into the search window.</p><p>\u201cYou could buy a car for fifty thousand dollars. A really nice car.\u201d Ascanio\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cA Hummer. You could buy a converted Hummer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need a Hummer,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cChicks dig the Hummer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need any chicks either.\u201d</p><p>He gave me an injured look. \u201cI have needs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have needs too and right now I need you to concentrate on tracking down Jamar\u2019s antique collection. Get to it.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019d been in the library for three hours when the magic hit, cutting our research short. We\u2019d identified thirty-seven items. Considering that my list of the vault\u2019s contents included only twenty-nine, that gave us at least eight artifacts for which we couldn\u2019t account. A knife from Crete; two necklaces from the Etruscan civilization, which was apparently some sort of pre-Roman culture in Italy; a cat-headed statue from the Kingdom of Kush; a bronze head of Sargon the Great, who was some sort of king in Akkadia; a spear from the same country; and two stone tablets with ancient Hebrew writings. None of those lit up with Christmas lights and sirens when we found them. Whether I liked it or not, it was time to quit and head home.</p><p>\u201cThat mechanic said he\u2019d found the check from the woman he towed,\u201d Ascanio said.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d He was going to be my next stop.</p><p>\u201cI can pick up that check for you,\u201d Ascanio offered.</p><p>I eyed him. \u201cPromise not to get yourself killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if there is any threat, you will run like a scared bunny.\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I gave him the money. \u201cDo not kill, do not get killed, do not mess up. Go, faithful apprentice!\u201d</p><p>He flashed me a grin and took off. Well, it would keep him out of trouble for a little while. Hopefully.</p><p>I stared at the now-dead computer terminal. Tonight Raphael and I would go to Anapa\u2019s house.</p><p>If all went well, we wouldn\u2019t kill each other.</p><p>CHAPTER 8</p><p>Raphael was on time. He was always on time. At seven, a small rock hit my bedroom window and bounced off the bars with a loud clink. I glanced through the glass. Raphael stood below, wearing a tuxedo.</p><p>Like we were kids going to the prom.</p><p>I swiped my oversized clutch off the bed and checked myself for the last time in the mirror. The evil dress was still stunning and badass. My blond hair floated around my head in a beautifully disarrayed cloud that had taken half an hour to arrange and coax into place. I\u2019d tweezed my eyebrows into a perfect shape, applied a narrow line of eyeliner around my eyes to make them stand out, brushed a light dusting of bronze onto my eyelids, and finished off with a double coat of mascara. My lips were a shimmering, intense red, matching the ruby of the dragon\u2019s eye.</p><p>I slipped a bracelet on my wrist: red garnets mixed with white sapphires. It was the only noncostume piece of jewelry I owned. My mother bought it for me when I graduated from the Order\u2019s Academy. I always thought it brought me luck.</p><p>I checked my clutch to see if the outline of my Ruger SP101 showed through the black leather. Nope. All good. With the magic up it wouldn\u2019t even fire, but it comforted me to have it with me. I didn\u2019t bring a knife. I could count on Raphael having several.</p><p>For some reason, when a typical weresomething got into a fight, nature flipped a switch in its head that dictated it grow claws and fangs and rip things apart instead of shooting them from a distance or cutting them with knives like smart people do. I always thought it was to Raphael\u2019s credit that he was the exception to this rule.</p><p>He was waiting. No more stalling. I was as hot as I was going to get.</p><p>I shrugged my shoulders and walked out of the apartment in my four-inch black heels. Click-click-click down the stairs and out the door.</p><p>The evening breeze swirled around me, flinging scents into my face. Raphael waited for me on the sidewalk. My brain took a second to process what I was seeing and got stuck. My coordination unraveled. I stopped.</p><p>Raphael wore a black tuxedo. The light of the early evening played on his face, painting the left side golden, while the right remained in cool shadow. He looked perfectly poised between darkness and light. The elegant jacket mapped the strength of his broad shoulders and the supple resilience of his narrow waist, bringing to the forefront both the natural beauty of his body and its dangerous edge. His blue eyes looked hard and focused, hammering home the point\u2014crossing him would be extremely unwise.</p><p>He didn\u2019t wear his tuxedo like a relaxed gentleman would wear a dinner jacket, nor did he wear it the way a knight wore his armor. Raphael wore it the way an assassin wears his leathers and cloak. He was a dagger in a black sheath. I wanted to reach for him, even knowing he would slice my flesh to pieces.</p><p>My heart hammered in my chest. This was such a bad idea. But it was my only chance at Anapa and his office, and I owed it to Nick and the families of four dead shapeshifters to take it.</p><p>Raphael was looking at me and I just stood there, unable to move. I had to do something. Say something.</p><p>Sad, sad Andrea cradling her pitiful broken heart. Pathetic.</p><p>The vitriol did its job. The world stopped spinning, my mind snapped into gear, and I finally registered the significance of Raphael\u2019s expression. He looked blank. Completely blank, as if he was gazing at something that had broken his brain.</p><p>\u201cRaphael?\u201d</p><p>He opened his mouth. Nothing came out.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>Raphael\u2019s lips moved. He swore.</p><p>Ha! I got him! Drink it in, darling. Where\u2019s your seven-foot-tall fianc\u00e9e now?</p><p>\u201cIs there something wrong with my dress?\u201d Rub it in, rub it in...</p><p>Raphael finally managed to formulate a word. \u201cNo. Just wondering where you hid your gun.\u201d</p><p>I showed him my giant clutch.</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d he said. \u201cDidn\u2019t see that.\u201d</p><p>Of course he didn\u2019t. He was too busy looking at me. It was a small revenge, but it tasted so sweet.</p><p>Raphael led me to his Pack Jeep that spat and roared, belching magic. He opened the door for me. As I got in, his scent slid along my skin, singing to me.</p><p>Maaate. Mate-mate-mate.</p><p>Damn it.</p><p>I sat in my seat. Instead of closing the door, he leaned toward me, a look of intense concentration on his face as if he were about to say or do something rash.</p><p>My breath caught in my throat. If he bent down to kiss me, I would punch him right in the face. I wouldn\u2019t be able to help myself.</p><p>Raphael pushed himself away from me and closed the door.</p><p>Good. It was better this way. Really.</p><p>Raphael got into the Jeep, shut the door, muting the roar of the water engine, and we took off.</p><p>He reached to the side compartment in his door, pulled out a folder, and dropped it on my lap. I opened it. A time line of his workers\u2019 movements on the night of the murder. \u201cGreat. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>I dug into the time line.</p><p>Twenty minutes later it was clear that none of Raphael\u2019s people had had time to double back to the site and murder their friends and colleagues. Raphael was the only man without a solid alibi. According to his schedule, he\u2019d gone home, apparently without his fianc\u00e9e. Knowing him, I had expected them to be at it like rabbits, but I guess even rabbits had an off day once in a while. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I tapped the paper. \u201cWhat about Colin? Jim\u2019s file said he\u2019s in debt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in debt because his house caught fire. He took out an emergency loan from the Pack. He works hard and he knows that if he\u2019s ever in trouble, he can come to me.\u201d</p><p>I leaned my head back, but not too hard\u2014wouldn\u2019t do to mess up my hair against the headrest.</p> <p>\u201cWe agreed to share information,\u201d Raphael said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have much to share. Spent all day at the library trying to pin down Jamar\u2019s art collection. Found eight items that weren\u2019t in the vault, some with pictures. Nothing stood out. Got a set of prints that doesn\u2019t belong to anyone on your payroll, but there are no hits in any of the databases. Analyzed a metric ton of trace evidence without any conclusive leads.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will solve it,\u201d he said. \u201cIf Jim hadn\u2019t assigned you to this, I would\u2019ve asked for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for the vote of confidence. So nobody can confirm that you went home?\u201d</p><p>Raphael shrugged. \u201cNo. Had I known I\u2019d have to provide an alibi, I would\u2019ve made sure not to spend the night alone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised you did.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t rise to the bait. \u201cIt\u2019s been forty-eight hours and we have no leads.\u201d</p><p>His tone told me he wasn\u2019t criticizing. His people were dead. Raphael was angry, frustrated, and hurting. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that. You know how it goes\u2014slow and steady wins the race.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He looked at the road. \u201cI had to sign the death benefit papers today.\u201d</p><p>That had to have sucked. \u201cNick came to see me. He\u2019s having a rough time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe isn\u2019t the only one,\u201d Raphael said. \u201cI should\u2019ve known about the vault. I should\u2019ve known it was there.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t beat yourself up,\u201d I told him. \u201cI pored over Jamar\u2019s press releases all day and I never once saw the vault mentioned. You didn\u2019t miss it. The information just wasn\u2019t there to begin with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really think Anapa had something to do with it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if he did. He has no criminal record. He has no parking tickets. His company is squeaky clean, although I didn\u2019t have time to dig too deep. In addition, I spent an hour on him in the library today and I found zip. He wouldn\u2019t see me, but he knows he\u2019s under scrutiny. His people know who I am, too.\u201d</p><p>Raphael glanced at me.</p><p>\u201cHis mouthpiece made sure to remind me that I no longer had the Order on my side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><p>Ah what? Ah\u2014too bad? Ah\u2014I understand? Ah\u2014serves you right? \u201cThey know who I am; they know I\u2019m tenacious. Why not spend ten minutes answering my questions? Then I go away, and everyone\u2019s happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think he\u2019s hiding something?\u201d</p> <p>I sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m collecting information and I\u2019ve run into a roadblock. Short of staging a break-in, this party is my best bet.\u201d</p><p>Raphael snorted. \u201cA break-in. You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought about it,\u201d I said. \u201cI think he has the roof heavily warded and there are a lot of surveillance cameras. He did leave a very nice route open for me, with cameras not covering it even, so I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s trapped six ways to Sunday. I\u2019d probably go through the basement instead. But again, since he isn\u2019t in the office much, there\u2019s not much point.\u201d</p><p>Raphael stared at me. I wished he would stop doing that. Every time he turned to me, my heart kept trying to pirouette out of my chest in a futile attempt to flop itself at his feet. Meanwhile my hands wanted to wrap around his throat and strangle him. It was good that my brain was in charge.</p><p>\u201cWho are you and what have you done with Andrea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the new and more-screwed-up version. Or much improved, depending on the way one looks at it.\u201d</p><p>He stared straight ahead. \u201cI thought being screwed up was something we had in common.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I was always the fucked-up one. You were the spoiled one.\u201d</p><p>The line of Raphael\u2019s jaw hardened. \u201cI\u2019ve worked since I was sixteen, six days a week. I\u2019ve built my company from nothing with ten thousand dollars of seed money I borrowed from the Pack, just like everyone else, and I\u2019ve paid back five times that. I am supporting the entire Clan Bouda now. Nobody gave me any special treatment. How exactly am I spoiled?\u201d</p><p>I blinked at him. \u201cSeriously?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Please, enlighten me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou remember last year you wanted to take that vacation in the Keys for a week?\u201d</p><p>He glanced at me. \u201cYou\u2019re going to hold our vacation against me? You loved it.\u201d</p><p>I did. It was just me and him and the ocean. \u201cDo you remember that bouda family wanted to join the clan about the same time? The De La Torre family?\u201d</p><p>An individual shapeshifter joining the Pack was a relatively simple affair. He presented himself to the alphas of his clan, and if they said yes, they would then in turn sponsor the shapeshifter before the Pack. With families and small packs, the process became complicated. Multiple background checks and individual interviews later, a special date had to be set, and alphas or betas of other clans had to be present.</p><p>Raphael shrugged. \u201cWhat about the De La Torres?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAunt B had the date set and you had to be there to sponsor them with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you told your mother that she was welcome to do whatever she wanted but you were going on your vacation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d worked seven-day weeks for two months nonstop.\u201d</p><p>I bared my teeth at him. \u201cAre you going to let me make my point or do I have to bite you to keep you from interrupting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you bite me, I\u2019ll bite back. And I grow bigger teeth.\u201d</p><p>Oh, it\u2019s like that, then. \u201cBut I\u2019m much more motivated.\u201d</p><p>He snarled. I snarled back and snapped my human teeth at him. A little crazy light sparked in Raphael\u2019s eyes, but I couldn\u2019t figure out what it meant. I used to be able to read him better. I used to know exactly what he was thinking\u2014it registered on his face and if it didn\u2019t, he would tell me. He was more closed in now, self-contained and hidden. There was a steely resolve there, and a hint of danger under the surface. Raphael had become unpredictable. It was exciting. Exciting was so not the emotion I was looking for.</p><p>\u201cWhat, nothing to say?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m waiting to see if you\u2019re going to do something or just flash your pretty teeth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tempt me.\u201d</p><p>I gave a mocking sigh. \u201cOh, I would. But then I would have to bring your battered body to your fianc\u00e9e and I hate hysterics. Or did you mean the other sort of tempting?\u201d</p><p>Raphael laughed. It was a wild laugh that promised all sorts of evil things. Fun evil things.</p><p>Something loomed in front of us.</p><p>\u201cBus!\u201d I barked.</p><p>He looked at the windshield and swerved, avoiding an overturned bus by a couple of inches.</p><p>Tiny needles of adrenaline prickled my skin. I shuddered, trying to shake them off. The hairs on the back of my neck stood on end. Spots ghosted just under my skin, making faint stains on my arms.</p><p>\u201cWhat was the point of bringing up the vacation?\u201d Raphael asked.</p><p>\u201cYour mother rescheduled everything. She traded a favor to Curran for a special dispensation so the family could stay for another week in the Pack\u2019s territory. She convinced Valencia to bump her ballet recital\u2014forty students had to change their schedule to match the new date. B schemed and shuffled things around. It didn\u2019t matter how many people were going to be inconvenienced, but her baby boy would have his vacation, by God.\u201d I laughed. \u201cI\u2019d walked in on her fighting with Valencia. It almost came to blood. I offered to move the vacation. She looked at me like I had grown a Christmas tree on my head.\u201d</p><p>I imitated Aunt B\u2019s voice. \u201cOh no, dear. You know how hard Raphael works. You two go down there and have a good time.\u201d</p><p>Raphael stared grimly through the windshield, steering around potholes in the magic-pitted pavement with surgical precision.</p><p>No comment, huh?</p><p>\u201cYou grew up sheltered and you don\u2019t even know how lucky you are. Your mother loves you more than life itself. She celebrates the fact that you exist.\u201d Considering that both of Raphael\u2019s brothers had gone loup in childhood and B had had to kill them, I couldn\u2019t hold that against her. \u201cYou\u2019re smart, handsome, and respected. You\u2019re a dangerous fighter and you\u2019ve made yourself wealthy\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cComfortable,\u201d he said through clenched teeth.</p><p>\u201cOkay, comfortable. Women throw themselves in your path. I bet when you brought your fianc\u00e9e to Aunt B, she didn\u2019t even blink an eye, when anybody else would have gotten tossed out of the Bouda House.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there a point to you stroking my ego?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not stroking. These are plain facts, darling. Raphael, you are adored. You have everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot everything,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cEverything,\u201d I repeated. \u201cIf you aren\u2019t spoiled, I don\u2019t know who is. That\u2019s why you can never put yourself in my shoes. All this good fortune gave you blinders. To you, \u2018bouda\u2019 means people who think you are a demigod. To me \u2018bouda\u2019 means people who break your bones for fun.\u201d</p><p>He turned to me again, his blue eyes dark. \u201cThis bouda clan never abused you. This Pack offered to protect you and take you in. You betrayed them.\u201d</p><p>And we were back to square one.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here.\u201d Raphael nodded ahead. At the end of the street, a spacious mansion rose against the sky, all carved white stone and gold accents. Beautiful.</p><p>A gated parking lot waited for us, complete with an attendant in a small booth, armed with an arbalest. If we parked in that lot, we would be trapped.</p><p>\u201cNot in the lot,\u201d I murmured.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Might have to leave fast.\u201d Raphael turned off onto the side street. Good idea. If we had to leave in a hurry, it would be quicker than maneuvering out of a parking lot. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I pointed at the half-ruined building. \u201cThat looks nice and shadowy.\u201d</p><p>He parked behind the ruin and shut off the engine, killing the constant noise that had provided background to our conversation. We sat steeped in the sudden quiet.</p><p>I faced him. \u201cWe keep coming back to this again and again, so let\u2019s just do this once and for all, because I don\u2019t want to talk about it anymore. Let\u2019s say the Bouda House got attacked and set on fire, and then some knight of the Order called asking for my help. Your mother forbids you to leave, because she needs you here. Your clan house is in ruins. I want you to come with me to help the Order. Would you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis is exactly what you don\u2019t understand.\u201d Raphael\u2019s face was resolute. \u201cIf my mother put that sort of condition on me, I would\u2019ve told her to fuck herself. Anyone who gives you an ultimatum of \u2018pick me\u2019 or \u2018save your friend\u2019 isn\u2019t worth your loyalty.\u201d</p><p>He had a point. \u201cYou\u2019re right. But my question stands. The Order was everything to me, Raphael. It was my pack, my family. Every day I got up and went to work, I took pride in being me, because I was a knight. I helped people. I wasn\u2019t a pathetic little freak creature that everyone kicked and punched whenever they felt like it. I didn\u2019t want to be that creature. Maybe it was cowardly to reject being a shapeshifter and pretend I was a human. I don\u2019t know. I do know that as long as I was a knight, I wasn\u2019t a victim. I mattered, do you understand that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cDo you think it was easy for me? Because it wasn\u2019t. Sometimes no matter what I did, I had shitty choices to make, and I made mine the best I could. So tell me, Raphael, would you have walked away from your mother and your clan to help the Order?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said. His tone told me he finally understood. He didn\u2019t like it, but he got it. The Order had been my family. It mistreated me, but you don\u2019t abandon your family just because they do something you don\u2019t like. We had finally reached an understanding. Sadly, it was too late for both of us.</p> <p>\u201cThen I consider this matter closed.\u201d I opened my car door and stepped out into the cooling air. A moment later he joined me. We walked down the street toward the mansion.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about the way things went down in the office,\u201d Raphael said. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have brought Rebecca. It was petty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWater under the bridge.\u201d I waved my hand at him and gave him a sweet smile. \u201cBut if you do it again, I\u2019ll kill you both.\u201d</p><p>He laughed under his breath. It was the delicious seductive laugh I remembered. \u201cBe careful, someone might mistake you for a filthy bouda.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like boudas. They\u2019re fun in bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey?\u201d A sudden edge crept into Raphael\u2019s voice.</p> <p>\u201cThey. Since you are now officially a taken man, you won\u2019t mind if I test-drive someone else from the clan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike who?\u201d</p><p>We strolled through the gates. The guard in the booth checked out my dress and stared. I gave him a friendly smile.</p><p>Raphael held up his invitation. The guard examined it and waved us on.</p><p>\u201cEnjoy the party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe will,\u201d Raphael answered in a voice that suggested hell would freeze over before he would enjoy anything.</p><p>We strolled up the sidewalk.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Raphael demanded.</p> <p>For a man a hair away from mating to another woman, he was very interested in my sexual adventures.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t decided yet. I always wanted to have a three-some.\u201d</p><p>Raphael stopped.</p><p>\u201cTwo guys or maybe a guy and a girl. Since you\u2019re more experienced than me, you must\u2019ve had both? Which one was more fun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy stop at two partners?\u201d Raphael said, enunciating the words very clearly. \u201cWhy not have half a dozen? You could hand out numbers to keep order. Get a little cute sign that says, \u2018Now serving.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Oh, the spoiled bouda didn\u2019t like that. Not one bit. \u201cDon\u2019t be silly. That would be tacky.\u201d I paused by the glass and wrought-iron door, waiting for him to open it.</p><p>\u201cTacky?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Raphael swung the door open. Inside, a tiled lobby waited for us, bathed in the bright glow of electric lamps made to look like old gaslight lanterns. I stepped through and nodded to an older woman standing by the door. She wore a dress the color of red wine and her makeup was flawless. Two men stood near her. Both looked like they chewed up bricks and spat out gravel for a living.</p><p>\u201cYour invitation,\u201d the woman said.</p><p>Raphael handed her the invitation and unleashed a smile. Wow. Ascanio didn\u2019t know it, but he had a long way to go.</p><p>The woman\u2019s face softened. She brushed the invitation with her manicured fingers and smiled back. \u201cWelcome to the party.\u201d</p><p>Sixteen or sixty, it didn\u2019t matter. Raphael smiled and they sighed. And he wondered why I thought he was spoiled.</p><p>Raphael put his hand on my back, gently escorting me to the next room. A spacious chamber stretched in front of us. Its cream walls rose high, supporting a twenty-foot ceiling. The granite floor was polished to an almost mirror gleam. Enormous, twelve-foot-tall windows, framed with gauzy white curtains and thicker golden draperies, spilled the weak evening light into the room. Matching accents ran along the molding. To our right a curved white staircase led upstairs. The entire place felt like a palace, graceful and somehow timeless.</p><p>The air smelled of wine, cinnamon, and another odd, but familiar aroma...oregano...no, marjoram, mixing with the lush, smoky sweetness of myrrh. \u201cInteresting choice for potpourri.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpicy.\u201d Raphael leaned to me, that dashing smile still on his face. \u201cI can\u2019t tell if he\u2019s covering up the scent of something bad with this perfume or not.\u201d</p><p>We stood for a long second, our nostrils fluttering, taking shallow breaths and trying to break the fragrance down to individual scents.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a bust,\u201d I said. If there were any hidden odors under that amalgam of herbs and resins, I couldn\u2019t find them.</p><p>Raphael furrowed his eyebrows. \u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>All around us people glided across the floor, men in tuxedos and tailored suits, women in expensive dresses and shiny rocks, looking like attendants to some ancient tyrant. Music emanated from somewhere above, gentle, exotic, and unobtrusive, like a hint of an intriguing perfume.</p><p>\u201cWhy do I get the feeling I\u2019m at court?\u201d I murmured.</p><p>\u201cAnd there\u2019s the king himself,\u201d Raphael said.</p><p>The guests parted and I saw a man. Of average height, he had a wealth of wavy hair the color of pale amber. An expensive suit of light gray sketched his lean figure. He turned.</p><p>Huh. Anapa was beautiful.</p><p>He was in his late thirties, closing in on forty. His narrow face, with pronounced cheekbones and a strong chin, was masculine but it was a civilized masculinity, refined, aristocratic, and very carefully groomed. Some wealthy men carried grooming too far, trimming their eyebrows and shaving their chins until they looked slightly feminine. Anapa stopped on the right side of that. His hair was perfectly cut but slightly tousled. His eyebrows still retained some shagginess. His lips were full and crisply drawn, but his cheeks and chin suggested the future possibility of stubble. His large blue eyes, with hooded eyelashes, betrayed a lively intellect and a spark of humor. His skin, sun-painted and dark for a blond, spoke of the South, bright sun, and blue water. He didn\u2019t seem Nordic in the least. More like Mediterranean.</p><p>He saw us and smiled, making laugh lines at the corners of his eyes stand out. It was a warm, friendly smile, as if he found something about us incredibly amusing and couldn\u2019t wait to share.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been seen,\u201d Raphael said, starting toward Anapa.</p><p>We strolled through the crowd toward our host. \u201cHow are we playing this?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a businessman and you are my brainless delicious arm candy.\u201d</p><p>Delicious arm candy? \u201cIt\u2019s good Rebecca isn\u2019t here or she\u2019d think I was poaching.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wouldn\u2019t know the meaning of the word,\u201d Raphael said, his face flat.</p><p>\u201cOh, she isn\u2019t a jealous type?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she actually wouldn\u2019t know what the word meant.\u201d</p><p>Ha!</p><p>The woman in the blue dress in front of us stepped aside and Anapa approached us.</p><p>\u201cMr. Medrano.\u201d Anapa offered his hand.</p><p>Raphael shook it. \u201cHappy birthday.\u201d</p><p>I batted my eyelashes and did my best to appear dumb as a board.</p><p>\u201cThank you, thank you.\u201d Anapa looked at me, still smiling, an appreciation in his eyes. There was nothing at all sexual in his gaze. He examined me more the way one would examine a rare good-looking dog. Or a horse. \u201cAnd you would be his lovely companion.\u201d</p><p>I slipped into my Texas twang and offered him my hand. \u201cGood evenin\u2019. Such a pleasure to meet you.\u201d</p><p>Anapa took my fingers into his. He raised my hand, as if to kiss it, and paused, inhaling the scent instead, savoring it. \u201cMmm.\u201d He chuckled softly. \u201cYou have the most intriguing body.\u201d</p><p>Okay, that was freaky.</p><p>Raphael moved, subtly inserting himself between me and Anapa. His hand covered mine and the other man let go. \u201cDear, say good-bye to Mr. Anapa. He has other guests to meet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye.\u201d I wiggled my fingers at him.</p><p>Anapa grinned at us again. \u201cFor now.\u201d</p><p>Raphael steered me into the crowd.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he growled. \u201cHe seemed normal before.\u201d</p><p>Apparently I had a special gift for bringing out the crazy in men.</p><p>We moved to the refreshments table and turned, scanning the room. A man on the staircase to our right. Two guys by the exit, a woman by the balcony, but no guards in the hallways radiating from the main room. I plucked a small piece of toast with pine nuts and mushrooms heaped on it from the appetizer tray and took a bite. Hmm. Yummy.</p><p>\u201cSecond floor,\u201d I murmured.</p><p>\u201cMhm,\u201d Raphael agreed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>If the office had been on the first floor, it would have a guard restricting access to it.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d Raphael asked.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p> <p>We stepped to the right in unison and began weaving our way from one group of people to the next. The second floor would have to wait. We had just come in and the guards were still watching us, and if they were good, they had probably nailed my identity by now. We had to circulate until they focused on someone else.</p><p>Forty minutes later, we had made a complete circuit of the room. The old Raphael used to be expert at small talk. He spoke to men about business, paid women subtle compliments, and everyone loved him. The new Raphael at my side seemed grimmer and less willing to chitchat. Despite his looming at my side like a dark but gorgeous shadow, we managed to ferret out the location of the office from a clueless older couple who had been invited there before. Anapa\u2019s lair of doom was on the second floor on the south side of the house. Coincidentally one of the first-floor bathrooms was on the south side too, a fact I discovered when I went to fix my hair.</p><p>The music grew louder. Couples were dancing, in the middle of the floor, swaying back and forth. The alcohol was going as fast as the waiters brought it out. A few people looked good and sauced on Anapa\u2019s superior grog. The small talk went from weather and harmless gossip to spicier topics and meaningful stares as the booze lowered inhibitions.</p><p>Raphael took my hand and led me to the middle of the floor.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I asked through my smile.</p> <p>\u201cIf I have to listen to another recount of how Malisha from Accounting hooked up with Clayton from Legal, I\u2019ll lose my mind.\u201d He turned me, still holding on to my hand, maneuvering me into a classic dance pose. His arm slid around my waist and I shivered.</p><p>\u201cSo you thought dancing would be better?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He began swaying. \u201cPretend to enjoy it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA handsome man, a great party, lovely food. What\u2019s not to enjoy? Oh wait, the man is you.\u201d I began swaying, too. I was really good at swaying. He would regret ever pulling me on this floor. \u201cYou like screwing with me, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, since we decided not to screw each other anymore, I have to get my fun somehow.\u201d</p><p>Since we\u2019re playing that game... I tilted my face up to his and gave him a lovesick gaze.</p> <p>\u201cDo you have to sneeze?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cBe quiet. I\u2019m pretending to enjoy your company, just as you said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry not to strain anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I won\u2019t. I\u2019m very good at faking it.\u201d</p><p>That shut him up.</p><p>We kept swaying. Standing close to him like this, all but wrapped up in his arms, was pure torture. I leaned closer to him and made a small noise, not quite a growl, not quite a purr, made from desire and lust. Raphael focused on me, like a hungry cat on a mouse.</p><p>\u201cYou should take me to the bathroom to make out,\u201d I told him.</p><p>A flash of ruby fire exploded in his irises and melted. He leaned closer, pulling me to him. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou should take me to the bathroom to make out,\u201d I repeated into his ear. \u201cThere is no way we can make it up that staircase. We can use the bathroom window to get to the second floor.\u201d</p><p>Raphael\u2019s hand slipped from my waist to cup my ass. A little electric zing dashed through me.</p><p>\u201cWow, straight for the goods, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t just make out right out of the blue.\u201d Raphael\u2019s grin was pure evil.</p><p>We swayed for a bit more.</p><p>Raphael squeezed my butt.</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged a little. \u201cFaking it, honey, you remember.\u201d</p><p>I wrapped my arms around his neck, stretched against him, like a lazy cat wanting a stroke.</p><p>At the other end of the room someone shattered a glass. The room collectively turned toward the sound. Raphael took my hand and we quietly slipped away into the left hallway. It was mostly deserted. Two guys milled about at the wall, engrossed in a discussion that involved phrases like \u201casshole\u201d and \u201clike he runs the damn place.\u201d They didn\u2019t pay us any mind.</p><p>A small sign on the door to the right said, BATHROOM.</p><p>Raphael tried the door. The handle didn\u2019t turn in his hand. Occupied.</p><p>A security guy stepped out from the room down the hallway, a severe unsmiling block of a black suit complete with an earpiece.</p><p>Raphael pushed me against the wall and braced my body with his, catching my right arm above my head and pinning it against the wall with his left. The oldest clich\u00e9 in the playbook.</p><p>He studied my face for a tiniest second, bent down...His lips touched mine.</p><p>I wanted to kiss him. I wanted him so badly and that need blocked out everything else. And why the hell couldn\u2019t I kiss him? So what if he had a fianc\u00e9e-to-be? I didn\u2019t owe her anything. Being good was overrated.</p><p>Raphael licked my lips, demanding, seducing. His teeth caught my lower lip, pulled lightly. I had him all to myself. In this moment he was entirely, completely mine.</p><p>I opened my mouth.</p><p>He lingered, kissing my lips, slowly, surely, as if we had all the time in the world and there was no need to hurry. Little electric shocks shot from my heart all the way to my fingertips.</p><p>His tongue slid into my mouth and touched the tip of mine. He tasted like Raphael: spice, fire, and need wrapped into one. I licked him, inviting him in. We kissed, every stroke of his tongue, every touch of his hands caressing my body, magnified to an almost painfully intense sensation. Warmth spread through me, my body ready for more. I wanted him to touch me. I wanted his hands on my breasts. I wanted to pull his clothes off and run my fingers down the hard muscle of his chest. I teased him, enticing him, then pulling back, letting him think he could reclaim my mouth and taking his instead.</p><p>It felt like coming home. It felt like medicine soothing a raw wound. I loved him so much, and I kissed him, drinking in the cocktail of sweet memories and bitter future.</p><p>The bathroom door opened next to us, the sound too loud in my ears.</p><p>I stopped and instantly Raphael straightened. A short man who had come out of the bathroom gave him a thumbs-up with a \u201cGo you!\u201d smile and headed down the hall. The security man was nowhere in sight.</p><p>The kiss had torn a gaping hole inside me. I wanted Raphael. I wanted to hold him and to know that he was all mine. I wanted to make love. I needed a cold shower.</p><p>I had to get myself together and I needed to decide how bad I was going to be, because making love to him in this bathroom right now would be really, really bad.</p><p>Raphael held the bathroom door open for me. I stepped inside. He followed and locked it.</p><p>Get a hold of yourself. You can do it. It was just a stupid ruse anyway.</p><p>He had the most self-satisfied look on his face. He\u2019d wanted me to melt right there and now he felt all smug because he\u2019d gotten under my skin. Apparently I was a toy.</p><p>You bastard. Okay, let\u2019s see how you like this.</p><p>I pushed him against the door and kissed him again, sliding my body against his, nibbling, licking, purring in his arms. He went for it, hook, line, and sinker. I let him start stripping his jacket off and broke away.</p><p>\u201cI think the bars on the window have silver in them, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He stopped, his tuxedo halfway off his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good that I brought gloves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAndrea!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Oh, you mean the kiss? I\u2019m sorry, I wasn\u2019t quite finished. I\u2019m all done now, no worries.\u201d I patted his chest. \u201cYour virtue is intact. You won\u2019t have to confess anything to Rebecca. It was just one kiss. It didn\u2019t mean anything.\u201d</p><p>His snarl was music to my ears.</p><p>I turned to the window. It was near the ceiling that it was just wide enough for us to get through. The bars formed a rectangular grate that gleamed weakly in the light of the moon, too pale not to be a silver alloy. Silver meant burned hands. I\u2019d handled silver bars with bare hands before. It felt like grabbing something dipped in acid.</p><p>I opened my clutch and took out my glass cutter and my gun, a black shirt, and a pair of cloth gloves. Behind me Raphael paced the length of the bathroom like a caged tiger.</p><p>All my hormones were still in overdrive, and my whole body was humming. My hands shook a little.</p><p>Inside the bag was a carefully concealed zipper. I unzipped it, and where a normal clutch would have had a lining, this one had thin shoulder straps and extra material that allowed it to be unfolded into a larger backpack. I\u2019d had it custom-made some time ago.</p><p>\u201cFancy.\u201d Raphael commented.</p><p>\u201cGlad you like it. Now I know what to get you for your birthday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want mine in blue,\u201d he said. \u201cTo match my eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you say.\u201d I slipped on the gloves. \u201cThe window is barred. Could you lift me, please?\u201d</p><p>He wrapped his hands around my legs and picked me up without a word. He didn\u2019t just lift me, he embraced me, caressing me without moving his hands. I was still keyed up, and when he touched me, I almost groaned.</p><p>Oh, it was on now. We were playing a sadistic little game, and I wouldn\u2019t lose to him.</p><p>I grabbed the grate. Solid. I braced one knee against the wall, and yanked it hard, pushing against Raphael. The grate came free. Raphael lowered me to the floor. I slid the grate behind the vanity, next to the trash can, slipped off my shoes, and turned my back to him.</p><p>\u201cCould you unzip me?\u201d</p><p>He touched my neck and drew my zipper down, slowly. A delicious little thrill ran through me. I had no idea I had so much bouda in me.</p><p>I stepped out of the dress. Underneath I wore a tiny black bra and spandex bike shorts. I slipped the shirt on, rolled my dress up, packed it, my shoes, my lucky bracelet, and my clutch into the backpack, and buckled the belt diagonally across my chest.</p><p>\u201cSwiss Army Purse,\u201d Raphael observed. I heard the familiar playful notes in his voice. The kiss must\u2019ve thrown him off balance, but he\u2019d recovered now, and he was up to something. \u201cAny handcuffs in there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, why, do you think I\u2019ll need some?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDepends on what you\u2019re planning to be doing and with whom.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And he went there. The Old Andrea would have given him a look. I leaned over to him with a sweet smile. \u201cI don\u2019t need handcuffs to keep a man in my bed. I think we both know that. If I really wanted to take you away from your fianc\u00e9e, I would. Lucky for her, I\u2019m not a glutton for punishment.\u201d</p><p>I put the glass cutter into my mouth, jumped up, and slid through the window, holding on to the bricks with my fingertips before he called my bluff. I heard Raphael unlock the bathroom. A moment later he pulled himself through the window with easy grace.</p><p>We climbed up like two lizards, hurrying up the wall. Raphael reached the second-floor window and ripped the grate off with a casual tug. I cut a semicircle of the window\u2019s glass, popped it out, slid my hand through the opening and unhooked the latch. The second latch followed, and I slid the window up and dived in, legs first. Raphael followed, setting the grate back in place.</p> <p>I looked around the dim room. The contours of a large canopy bed rose from the gloom to the right.</p><p>Raphael brushed against my back. My body stood at attention. Sex? Yes, please. My mind said, \u201cNot until hell freezes over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re touching me,\u201d I chided him.</p><p>He caressed my back, sliding his hand down, hitting every sensitive point I hadn\u2019t even known I had. \u201cNo, this is touching you. That was just accidental contact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh? Good to know. If you touch me again and I break your arm off, you can be sure it will be completely accidental.\u201d</p> <p>He stepped close, his thigh brushing my butt. I elbowed him in the ribs. It was hardly a gentle nudge.</p><p>He laughed.</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s difficult, since I have a shapely butt and all, but try to focus on our illegal burglary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs opposed to legal burglary?\u201d</p><p>Argh.</p><p>I snuck to the door and edged it open. The hallway was empty. Ahhh. Finally things were looking up. I padded out of the door and down to the end of the hallway, where a massive wooden door loomed. Supposedly the office waited behind it. I left the bedroom and jogged to the door. Raphael followed me.</p> <p>I tried the handle. Unlocked.</p><p>\u201cToo easy,\u201d Raphael murmured.</p><p>If we got caught, the Pack would have hell to pay.</p><p>\u201cNo choice now.\u201d I stepped into the office.</p><p>The scent of myrrh spiced the air. Rows of brown shelves looked at me, filled with assorted volumes and objects. A brigantine cast in pewter with startling detail. An ancient vase, a statue of a muscular man kneeling. Next to the shelves, a heavy rectangular desk sat on a spare rug, its corners trimmed with golden accents. Three chairs waited for someone to sit down, one behind the desk and two in the corners of the room. Shimmering golden curtains framed the two windows. Decorations of twisted metal hung on the black walls, the most prominent being metal scales with a moon above them, on the wall directly opposite the desk. The moon\u2019s stylized eyes were closed to mere slits and her mouth smiled.</p><p>The place was empty.</p><p>Raphael moved past me and checked the windows. I locked the door and slipped behind the desk. From this vantage point, the room took on a new light. Every object within the office had been placed into a precise position oriented with the person behind the desk in mind. The desk was the center of this little cosmos, and the moment I sat behind it, I became the focal point of the room, as if I had assumed a place in the center of some invisible convergence of power. If inanimate objects could worship, the trappings of Anapa\u2019s office would have knelt before me, because I sat in the place of their god.</p><p>The tiny hairs on the back of my neck stood up. Whatever intelligence was at work here, it couldn\u2019t possibly be human. People did not think like this.</p> <p>Raphael peeled himself from the window and stood by me. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>I beckoned him with my hand. He approached and I took him by the shoulder and tugged him down to my level. \u201cLook at the room.\u201d</p><p>He surveyed the office. His eyes widened.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just me, is it?\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He bared his teeth. \u201cThe sooner we get out of here, the better.\u201d</p><p>I tried the bottom drawer. It opened easily. I rummaged through it. Papers, monthly business statements from the bank...nothing interesting. I tried the top one. Locked.</p><p>Raphael pulled a pick from his pocket and threaded it into the lock. He twisted and the lock clicked. Raphael slid the drawer open. A brown leather folder. I plucked it out, put it on the desk and opened it. A clear plastic sleeve shielded a photograph: an ivory bowl carved with figures of people engaged in combat and long vessels with little cabins sailing over the sea of drowned men.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think the country of origin for this is?\u201d</p><p>Raphael was watching the office. \u201cHell if I know.\u201d</p><p>I wished I had Kate with me. She would\u2019ve told me when and where it was made and for what god.</p><p>I turned to the next plastic page. This photograph showed an ancient jug made of brown clay with a long conical spout. The tip of the spout had broken off.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think this is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA piss-pot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is not a piss-pot. Will you take this seriously?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking this very seriously,\u201d he said under his breath.</p><p>I flipped the plastic. A beat up\u2013looking dagger with an ivory handle...Wait a minute.</p><p>\u201cI know this.\u201d I tapped the plastic. \u201cI saw it today in the library. Jamar had bought that knife. It\u2019s from Crete and I didn\u2019t see it in the vault.\u201d</p><p>I stared at the knife. It was very plain, with a foot-long, curved blade and a simple ivory handle in surprisingly good condition.</p><p>Raphael focused on the blade. \u201cIt\u2019s ceremonial.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe blade has never been sharpened.\u201d He drew his finger along the knife\u2019s curved edge. \u201cSee? No marks on the metal. Also the profile is wrong. It\u2019s too curved to stab in a forward motion, but if I slashed with this, I couldn\u2019t draw it through the wound all the way. It almost looks like a tourn\u00e9 knife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a cooking knife for peeling. You remember, we have the set in our butcher block.\u201d</p><p>He would have to stop saying \u201cour\u201d sometime. Pointing it out to him now would stop the flow of knife information, though, and I needed his expertise. I knew guns, but Raphael knew knives.</p><p>He kept going. \u201cIf it was sharpened and shorter, it might be a variation of a karambit, a curved knife from the Philippines. Shaped like a tiger\u2019s claw. I never really saw much use in it\u2014too small and my own claws are bigger. Where was this found, did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrete.\u201d</p><p>Raphael frowned. \u201cCretan knives and swords were typically narrow and tapered, like the Greek kopis.\u201d He turned the picture. Turned it again. \u201cHmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He lifted the picture with the knife pointing down. \u201cPickaxe. That\u2019s what it reminds me of. The only way to get the maximum effect of this blade is to stab someone with it straight down.\u201d He raised her fist and made a hammering motion. \u201cLike with an ice pick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike if someone was tied down and you stabbed them in the heart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPossibly. And Anapa killed four people for that?\u201d Raphael\u2019s voice dripped with derision and rage.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know that.\u201d I couldn\u2019t keep the excitement out of my voice. \u201cAll we know is that Anapa knew about the knife and it\u2019s important. We don\u2019t know why.\u201d And there was no convenient description of it either. A little card listing its name and special powers would\u2019ve been nice. \u201cIt\u2019s a place to start looking.\u201d</p><p>I flipped to the end of the book. More artifacts. Nothing else I recognized. The knife had to be the key.</p><p>\u201cYou matter to me,\u201d Raphael said. \u201cYou always did, and not because you were a knight or a shapeshifter.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly the game wasn\u2019t funny anymore. \u201cI mattered so much that rather than waiting for me to get my shit together, you found another woman. Let\u2019s be honest, Raphael, get a blowup doll, put a blond wig on her, and she and I would matter about the same to you. Hell, the blowup doll might be better. She won\u2019t talk.\u201d Christ, I sounded bitter.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to play anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>It hurt. You\u2019d think I\u2019d be numb by now.</p><p>\u201cToo late. You are about to be engaged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRebecca doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cRaphael, she\u2019s a living, breathing woman. Someone you felt strongly about. Of course, she matters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRebecca isn\u2019t my fianc\u00e9e.\u201d</p><p>I froze. \u201cCome again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said, Rebecca is not my fianc\u00e9e,\u201d he repeated.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, she isn\u2019t \u2018my fianc\u00e9e\u2019? I mean, your fianc\u00e9e.\u201d</p><p>Raphael shrugged. \u201cShe\u2019s some gold digger I picked up at a business engagement. Someone must\u2019ve pointed me out to her as a good catch, so she attached herself to me. My mother has been getting on my last nerve with her machinations, and since I had to go to the Bouda House for a barbecue, I took Rebecca there. After she told Mom that it was very exciting that we all turned into wolves, I explained to my mother that if she didn\u2019t lay off me, someone like Rebecca would be my next mate. Rebecca must\u2019ve overheard me.\u201d</p><p>This was not happening.</p><p>\u201cYou left me,\u201d Raphael said. \u201cNo explanation. We had a fight, then we all went to battle Erra, and after she set all of us on fire you disappeared. I thought you were dead. I went to every hospital. I sat in waiting rooms. Every time they would bring in a new charred body, I\u2019d stop breathing because I thought it might be you under all that crusted meat. And what do I get after all that? A note in the mail. Five days later. Five fucking days later, Andrea! \u2018Don\u2019t look for me, I have to do something for the Order, I will be back soon.\u2019 A fucking note. No explanation, nothing. You dismissed me from your life and went on your crusade. Now, weeks later, you suddenly decide to call me, like I\u2019m just some mutt who will always be waiting for you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I opened my mouth.</p><p>\u201cI brought her because I wanted you to know what it felt like. You go through life so hung up on helping people you barely know that you hurt people who actually give a damn. You want the truth about Rebecca? Fine. I barely know her. She was a means to an end. I haven\u2019t even slept with her. I thought about it.\u201d</p><p>There were too many words I wanted to say at once.</p> <p>\u201cOut of spite,\u201d Raphael said. \u201cShe kissed me and it didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d</p><p>The correct response finally accreted in my mind. I made my mouth move.</p><p>\u201cI hate you.\u201d</p><p>He spread his arms. \u201cWhat else is new?\u201d</p><p>Everything that churned inside me, everything that hurt and twisted, like a whirlwind of shattered glass in my chest, tore out, shredding through my brave front. \u201cYou broke my heart, Raphael!\u201d I snapped. \u201cI cried for hours when I got home last night. It felt like my life was over, you egoistical sonovabitch. And you, you put me through this just to teach me a lesson? Who the hell do you think you are? Do you have any idea how much that hurt?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said. \u201cI know exactly how much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is a difference! I was one of those charred bodies in a hospital bed. I was out for three days and woke up in a military hospital, chained to my bed. There was an Order\u2019s advocate sitting by my side. I had no choice: either I came with him or I would be taken into custody by the Order and brought to headquarters in leg irons. I got to write two notes, stop by my apartment for ten minutes to grab my clothes, and we were gone. I didn\u2019t even have a chance to make arrangements for Grendel. I had to take the dog with me and they agreed to it only because I would rather fight the lot of them than let the dog starve to death inside my place. I didn\u2019t hurt you on purpose, but you hurt me deliberately. Am I a toy to you?\u201d</p><p>His eyes sparked with red. \u201cI could ask you the same thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou...you asshole! You spoiled baby!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSelf-centered idiot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMomma\u2019s boy!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cStuck-up, self-righteous harpy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so done with you,\u201d I told him through clenched teeth.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m tired of doing things your way,\u201d Raphael said lazily. \u201cDon\u2019t expect me to go meekly into the night just because you said so.\u201d</p><p>My voice could\u2019ve cut through steel. \u201cIf you don\u2019t, I\u2019ll shoot you.\u201d</p><p>He snapped his teeth. \u201cYou better make it count. One shot will be all you get.\u201d</p><p>That challenge burned right through the last of my defenses. My other self spilled out of my human body in a mess of fur and claws, exhaling fury. I snapped my monster teeth at him, my beastkin voice a ragged snarl. \u201cI\u2019ll carve your heart out. You\u2019ll regret the day you were ever born. Of all the selfish, egoistical bastards\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you want me.\u201d He grinned. \u201cYou can\u2019t wait to climb back in my bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrow up!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLook who\u2019s talking.\u201d</p><p>The magic slammed into us, like a massive deluge. Wards spilled from the top of the door frame and windows in shimmering curtains of translucent orange. Blue symbols ignited in the corners of the room.</p><p>The moon on the wall opened its eyes with a metallic screech.</p><p>I dived under the desk and Raphael flattened himself against the wall, under the scales.</p><p>\u201cBoudas,\u201d the moon said in Anapa\u2019s amusement-saturated voice. \u201cSo predictable. Couldn\u2019t resist snooping around, could you?\u201d</p><p>Crap! Crap, crap, crap.</p><p>Raphael jerked a curtain off the window and tossed it over the moon.</p><p>\u201cThat won\u2019t help you,\u201d Anapa said. \u201cDon\u2019t leave. I\u2019ll be right there.\u201d</p><p>I lunged out from under the desk and hit the ward on the closest window. Pain burned through me, I blinked, and Raphael pulled me off the floor. My teeth rattled in my skull.</p><p>\u201cAh-ah-ah,\u201d Anapa-Moon said. \u201cI told you not to leave.\u201d</p><p>Raphael hurled himself at the window ward. His resistance to magical wards was higher than mine. The defensive spell clutched at him, sharp whips of orange lightning stinging his skin. His body jerked, rigid. His eyes rolled back in his skull.</p><p>I grabbed him and pulled him back. The orange lightning kissed me, and I almost blacked out again. We crashed to the floor.</p><p>\u201cFi-fi-fo-fum,\u201d the moon sang. \u201cI smell the blood of hyena man and I\u2019m coming up the staaaairs.\u201d</p><p>Raphael\u2019s eyes snapped open. He surged off the floor and looked up.</p><p>If we busted through the floor, we\u2019d fall right into the welcoming embrace of his security. Going through the ceiling was our best bet.</p><p>\u201cPick me up!\u201d I called.</p><p>He grabbed me and thrust me upward. I punched the ceiling, putting all of my strength into it. The panel broke from the impact of my fist, and I hit the wood beam underneath it.</p><p>\u201cWhat are the two of you up to?\u201d the moon wondered.</p><p>I hammered the ceiling with my fist again and again, widening the hole. The wood cracked, then broke under the barrage of my punches. I tore the broken section of the beam out, hurling it aside, and punched the darkness. It tore and the night sky winked at me through the narrow gap. No attic. We would break out straight onto the roof above. Raphael set me down on my feet, took a running start, and jumped, flipping in midair, kicking at the opening I had made. He landed in a roll as a shower of wooden boards hit the floor. \u201cGo.\u201d</p><p>I crossed my arms over my head and jumped. Wood and shingles hit my forearms, and I grabbed onto the roof and pulled myself up. The edge of the roof glowed with magic. On the ground below, huge orange symbols stretched across the luminescent lawn, a pale yellow glow coating every single blade of grass in a sheath of magic. The entire yard around the house was warded and it was a hell of a ward. Great.</p><p>Raphael forced his way through the hole behind me.</p><p>Landing on the lawn wasn\u2019t an option. The magic could fry us or do something worse. I spun around looking for a tree, a tower, a wall, anything close enough to jump to from the roof.</p><p>At the far end of the roof a long cable dived down to the wall that surrounded Anapa\u2019s home.</p><p>\u201cPower line,\u201d we barked at each other at the same time.</p><p>We dashed along the roof. I danced onto the power line and ran along it, balancing on my oversized feet. One, two, three, tilt, tilt...I leaped on the low stone wall that separated Anapa\u2019s house and yard from the street. Raphael pulled off his shoes, hurled them into the night, took a running start and jumped, catching the power line with his arms. He swung himself back up on it and walked slowly, arms out, suspended between the glowing orange lawn and the black sky.</p><p>I held my breath.</p><p>The side door of the mansion sprang open. A deep rumbling roar reverberated through the night, made by a cavernous mouth. My hackles rose.</p><p>Raphael swayed, ran the next ten feet, and jumped, clearing the remaining distance in one powerful leap. He sailed through the air and landed on the wall, next to me.</p><p>A bright, unnaturally yellow flash of light exploded on the lawn. I didn\u2019t wait to see what it was. We jumped down off the wall into the street and ran.</p><p>The roar chased us. Out of the corner of my eyes, I caught a glimpse of a huge shadow leaping over the wall like it was nothing. The creature landed on the street behind us, as big as a rhino, its head with a huge mane armed with long crocodilian jaws. Its odor hit me, a pungent oily odor, reminiscent of rotten fish, old blood, and decomposing sweat, shot through with an unnatural stench. Revolting, violent, terrible, it lashed at me, promising death. Fear squirmed through my body. My instincts whipped me into a sprint.</p><p>We raced down the street.</p><p>The thing behind us roared again and gave chase. It pounded after us, huge, but freakishly fast.</p><p>I glanced back. The distance between us was shrinking.</p><p>The air turned to fire in my throat. A stitch pricked my side.</p><p>Run. Run faster. Faster!</p><p>I glanced over my shoulder again. The beast was gaining. We were sprinting full-out, and it was gaining.</p><p>We took a corner at breakneck speed. A ruined building loomed in front of us, a big, dark wreck with a gaping black hole in its bottom floor. Raphael pointed at it. We veered right and leaped through the gap into the darkness.</p><p>Inside, the building was vast and empty, a shell bordered by outer walls. Tall support columns rose up, supporting nothing\u2014the top floors had crumbled long ago, and the moon shone through the holes in the dusty glass roof, painting the floor in random patches of blue light. We flew across it like two phantoms, silent and quick, and sank into the deep inky shadows against the opposite wall. Raphael reached over and squeezed my hand. I squeezed back.</p><p>Maybe the beast would pass.</p><p>A dark silhouette loomed in the gap in the wall through which we had entered. No such luck.</p><p>The beast took a step forward. Half of its body swung down\u2014it lowered its head. I heard it sniff. Tiny puffs of dust slid across the floor. It was tracking us. If we fled, it would outrun us. If we took to the rooftops, we\u2019d eventually run into ruins and have to land, and it would be waiting. We had to kill it.</p><p>Next to me Raphael shrugged off his tuxedo jacket. He wore twin leather sheaths underneath. He drew two foot-long knives out and passed them to me. I held them while he pulled off his shirt. His pants followed. He took the knives back and I eased my backpack off my shoulders.</p><p>The beast took a step forward. Claws screeched on the concrete. Step\u2014scratch. Step\u2014scratch. Its revolting scent drifted toward us, washing over me like a shower of cold slime.</p><p>I gathered myself into a tight clump.</p><p>The beast moved into a patch of light and my pulse sped up. What I had mistaken for a mane of coarse hair was a mane of tiny brown tentacles. They wriggled and twisted, stretching and coiling, like a nest of three-foot-long, thin earthworms. Scratch the neck from the list of possible targets. Cutting or clawing through the mass of writhing flesh would take too long.</p><p>The beast dipped its head again, bracing on powerful legs sheathed in sandy fur. The long claws on its front paws scratched the dust. Its sturdy frame looked built for ramming. If it took a running start, it would smash straight through the wall and not even slow down. I could see no weakness. Why did things like this always happen to me when I didn\u2019t have an assault rifle handy? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The beast raised its head. Large yellow owl eyes peered straight at us.</p><p>We\u2019d have to go for the gut and eyes. Those were our only options.</p><p>I touched Raphael and pointed to my eyes. He nodded, hunched down, muscles contracting, and leaped. His skin burst in midjump as his body snapped into a new, stronger form. A man had started the leap, but a bouda in warrior form finished it: a seven-foot-tall lethal hybrid of animal and man, armed with deadly claws and wicked teeth set into oversized jaws that could crush a cow\u2019s femur like it was a peanut shell.</p> <p>I dashed to the side.</p><p>Raphael landed on top of the beast and raked its back with his blades. Blood drenched the gashes. The creature bellowed and dropped to the ground, rolling. Raphael leaped off, into the gloom. The beast sprang to his feet and whirled, trying to lunge after him.</p><p>I struck from the side, slicing across its forehead with my claws. The creature whipped back, too fast. Teeth grazed my skin. I jumped back and the beast lunged at me, snapping its teeth. I leaped backward again and again, zigzagging as it chased me. Damn, it was fast.</p><p>Raphael shot out of the gloom and cut at the beast\u2019s side with his knives.</p><p>The beast paid him no mind. The tentacles on its head sparked with deep orange. The orange light pulsed outward and caught my arm. An intense ache seared my shoulder, a cold burn, like someone had skinned my arm open and poured liquid nitrogen over the muscle.</p> <p>I cried out and raked its snout with my claws, gouging the sensitive flesh.</p><p>The beast lunged at me. The glow pulsed and clutched me. Pain exploded in my head. I couldn\u2019t move; I couldn\u2019t make a sound. I just shuddered in the magic\u2019s grip, the agony so intense, it felt like my bones were splintering.</p><p>Someone cut my legs off, the walls somersaulted, and I crashed into the dirt.</p><p>Behind the beast Raphael turned into a whirlwind of steel, flinging blood into the night.</p><p>The beast howled.</p><p>I tried to get up, but I still couldn\u2019t move my legs. I could see them right there in the dirt, but they didn\u2019t obey.</p> <p>Raphael hammered a massive kick into the creature\u2019s ribs.</p><p>The abomination spun toward him, its mane sparking.</p><p>Raphael ran.</p><p>The creature bellowed, an otherworldly, terrible sound. Blood from the cuts I\u2019d caused dripped into its eyes, rendering it half-blind. It raised its snout, inhaled, and charged after Raphael.</p><p>I just had to get up. I had to pull myself upright.</p><p>Raphael sprinted along the wall, leaping over the piles of refuse. The creature raced after him, devouring the distance between them in huge leaps. The floor shook with each thud of its paws.</p><p>I rolled up to my knees, clumsy like a drunk, and forced myself upright.</p><p>The creature\u2019s mane turned bright orange.</p> <p>\u201cMagic!\u201d I yelled.</p><p>Raphael glanced over his shoulder.</p><p>The orange glow around the beast\u2019s mane coalesced and whipped from the creature in twin bolts of bright lightning. Raphael zigzagged, but it was too late. The left bolt caught his ankle, splintering into a dozen small forks that bit into Raphael\u2019s flesh. It jerked him off the ground.</p><p>The world stopped. All I could see was Raphael\u2019s face, twisted by pain. Fear clamped onto me and spurred me into a desperate sprint.</p><p>For a second he seemed to float weightlessly, suspended a foot above the ground, and then he crashed down, rolling in the dirt.</p><p>Please don\u2019t die. Please, please, don\u2019t die.</p><p>There were fifty yards between me and the beast. It felt like I was running for an eternity, stuck in some sort of hell, watching the man I loved die in slow motion.</p><p>The beast snorted in vicious glee.</p><p>I\u2019ll get there, honey. Hang on another half a second.</p><p>The giant jaws opened wide, teeth ready to rend.</p><p>I smashed into the beast from the side, thrust my claws under it, and sank them into the creature\u2019s gut. Blood drenched me. Slippery innards slid against my fingers. I grabbed them and yanked.</p><p>The beast spun, trying to bite me. I sank my claws into the wound and hung on. The orange lightning bit into me, fire and ice wrapped in pain. The moonlight dimmed.</p><p>Raphael loomed on the other side of the beast and clawed it. He was alive. I almost cried from the relief.</p><p>The magic stung us again.</p><p>Oh my God. It hurt.</p><p>The magic wouldn\u2019t kill us. It just hurt.</p><p>Hurt.</p><p>Raphael and I stared at each other over the beast\u2019s spine through the haze of pain and laughed. Our eerie hyena cackles echoed through the ruin.</p><p>It wanted to play the hurting game against two boudas. It had no chance.</p><p>We mauled the beast.</p><p>It raked us with its hind legs and shocked us with its magic, and we clawed it and clawed it, hanging on and laughing through the pain. I tasted blood in my mouth and clawed even harder, digging into the beast\u2019s stomach, wrenching innards and bone out. We carved and gouged, blacking out and coming to, throwing blood and wet entrails.</p><p>The beast shuddered.</p><p>We ripped into it. It was the creature or us, do or die.</p><p>The beast stumbled, careened to the side, and crashed down.</p><p>I looked up, breathing hard. Across from me Raphael stood, covered in gore. His muscular furry chest heaved. Between us the beast lay, the bones of its rib cage bare. We had nearly stripped its carcass. It should\u2019ve died ages ago, but the magic must\u2019ve kept it alive.</p><p>I sank to the floor. My body was red with blood, some of it the beast\u2019s, some my own. Long scratches marked my side and right leg from the hip down\u2014gouges from the beast\u2019s claws. The cuts burned. If I were human, I\u2019d have needed hundreds of stitches.</p><p>We won. Somehow we had won and both of us had survived. It was some sort of miracle. I was bone tired. The floor looked so nice. Maybe if I just lay down here for a minute and closed my eyes...</p><p>\u201cAndrea.\u201d</p><p>Raphael\u2019s eyes glowed with ruby fire. His face, a meld of human and hyena, didn\u2019t mirror emotions well but his eyes stared at me with a chilling determination.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking you home.\u201d</p><p>My mind chewed on his words, trying to break them into chunks. Take me home? Take me home...Home. With him.</p><p>My fatigue evaporated in an instant. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. You\u2019re coming home with me. We\u2019ll take a bath and eat and make love, and everything will be fine.\u201d</p><p>I got my ass off the floor. \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m done doing things your way. Your way means we don\u2019t talk for months. You\u2019re coming home with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou hurt me, on purpose, but everything is cool now, because you didn\u2019t sleep with Rebecca and we can go home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t work this way. I\u2019m not going home with you. You and I are done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re mine,\u201d he snarled.</p><p>What the hell. Maybe the fight had knocked some screw loose in his brain.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll always be mine.\u201d He stepped on the carcass and started toward me. I looked into his eyes and saw bouda insanity glaring back. The fighting had tipped the balance between rational thought and crazy passion. Raphael\u2019s emergency brake was malfunctioning and he and I were on a collision course. \u201cYou know it and I know it. We love each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re bad for each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not leaving me again!\u201d he growled.</p><p>The adrenaline still coursing through me surged up. He was challenging me! I marched toward him, put my muzzle as close to his as I could, and said slowly, clearly pronouncing every word, \u201cI am leaving you. You don\u2019t get to play with me. I\u2019m not your pet and you don\u2019t get to hurt me because you think I should be punished.\u201d</p><p>Baiting him was stupid. I knew that, but I couldn\u2019t help myself. The crazy cocktail of biochemicals and magic that got me through this fight drove me on. I knew I should stop, but it was as if there were two of me\u2014the rational Andrea and the emotion-crazy beastkin\u2014and right now the rational Andrea was being dragged off by a raging river of hormones, while the beastkin Andrea waved good-bye from a cliff nearby.</p><p>I bit off words. \u201cYou broke my heart and now I\u2019m walking away from you. Watch me.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d hurt me. He would pay.</p><p>\u201cThis is me walking away.\u201d I turned and took a couple of steps. \u201cAre you watching?\u201d</p><p>He lunged at me, and we went down, rolling in the dirt, arm over leg. My back hit the floor and Raphael pinned me in a classic schoolyard bully mount, sitting on my stomach. One of the worst positions you can be trapped in. Great.</p><p>\u201cNot walking away now,\u201d he said.</p><p>I bent my knees, planted my heels in the ground, and bridged under him. He pitched forward, his right hand coming down on the ground. Got you. I dropped my hips, caught his right arm, pulling it snug against my chest, stepped my right foot over his, capturing him, and bridged sharply to the right. Raphael pitched over and I rolled up on top of him. He clamped my shoulders with his hands.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting up and walking out of here. You\u2019ll have to fight me to stop me. Your call.\u201d</p><p>Raphael opened his arms. He was letting me go. I had known he would.</p><p>I jumped to my feet and walked away. A part of me was screaming, What are you doing, stupid? Run back. I kept walking, holding on to the memory of Raphael telling me, \u201cI know exactly how much it hurt.\u201d This thing between us was too complicated and it hurt too fucking much. I had nothing left in me now and I couldn\u2019t deal with it.</p><p>Behind me Raphael roared, shaking the ruin. I kept walking. The sound of his frustration chased me until I finally broke into a run. My body hurt. Fever heated my face from the inside\u2014the Lyc-V was trying to mend my battered body. If only mending other things were that easy.</p><p>I ran faster, scurried up the wall, through the opening, and out into the moonlit night. I leaped onto the nearest roof and ran and ran, the air burning in my lungs, droplets of the beast\u2019s blood falling off my body, leaving a grisly trail.</p><p>I kept going until the fatigue built into an ache in my limbs. I was on a roof...somewhere. The buildings around me no longer looked familiar. I slowed, then stopped. Behind me the city stretched, steeping in magic. In front, a river flowed, like a silvery serpent glinting in the moonlight. Tall trees stood guard on the distant bank. Tiny points of light, green and turquoise, drifted gently between their branches. I had run all the way across the city to Sibley Forest, one of the new post-Shift woods, supercharged by magic and filled with hungry things that viewed humans as tasty, fun-to-catch snacks. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The trees beckoned me. They looked so peaceful and even though I knew they weren\u2019t, I couldn\u2019t resist.</p><p>I dived off the building into the river. Cool water foamed around me with a million bubbles. I surfaced and swam, gliding through the cool depths as if I were flying. The river ended too soon, and I emerged onto the opposite bank, dripping wet but no longer bloody. I climbed up and made my way through the underbrush. The forest sang to me in a dozen different voices and teased me with a myriad of smells. I inhaled the spicy scent of forest herbs, the musk of a raccoon, and the slightly bitter scent of opossum. My ears twitched, catching the sounds of mice scurrying in the underbrush, the distant hooting of an owl, and the chirping of cicadas, fiddling away in the soothing darkness.</p><p>As I walked, the grasses rubbed against my legs, tickling my fur. Above me a dense vine covered with tiny white flowers shivered in the night breeze. The tiny flowers detached, glowing with pale green, and floated past me, like fairy lights. Fascinated, I crouched in the grass and watched one of the glowing blossoms settle on a leaf. So pretty.</p> <p>I walked the woods, thinking of nothing at all. If I could\u2019ve shifted into a hyena, I would\u2019ve. I just wanted to cool down, smell things, watch animals move about, and pretend that I was part of this world, rather than the place across the river. My choices were simpler here. Lay in the grass or on a fallen log. Watch the mice or try to catch one. Listen to the owl hooting or listen to the frogs singing. Simple and easy.</p><p>Finally I climbed a large tree, curled up in its branches, and fell asleep.</p><p>CHAPTER 9</p><p>Sleeping in a tree seemed like a great idea in theory. In practice, I woke up just before sunrise, all achy, my fur damp with morning dew, and reeking of decomposing blood. Apparently not all of it had washed off in the river. The magic had fallen, with tech once again holding on to the planet\u2019s reins, and the magical forest of yesterday was a soggy, muddy, and unpleasant place. Faced with the lovely choice of remaining in my beastkin shape or trotting across the city butt-naked, I decided that fur was preferable. I cleared the river and stuck to the rooftops.</p><p>I had conspired to break the law with my ex-boyfriend, who I professed to hate, broken said law, destroyed the victim\u2019s attack dog/magic creature in a fit of murderous frenzy, and then run away across the city, wandered around some woods, and fallen asleep in a tree in my beastkin shape.</p> <p>When I went off the rails, I didn\u2019t do it halfway. No, I flipped a few times, caught a lot of air, and then exploded in a fiery crash.</p><p>I made it to my building, walked up the stairs to my apartment, and stared at my door. My keys were in my backpack, which I had dropped before we fought the monster in the warehouse. The bars on my windows were welded to a metal frame built into the brick wall. I could probably bend them, if I strained hard enough and wrapped something around my hands, since the bars had silver in them, but I\u2019d take out some of the wall with them. How the hell was I going to get inside without busting the door?</p><p>Footsteps came from below. A moment and Mrs. Haffey walked up the stairs, carrying something wrapped in a kitchen towel.</p><p>Awesome.</p><p>Mrs. Haffey saw my furry butt and stopped. For a long second we stared at each other, she in a pink bathrobe and I, six feet tall, furry, bloody, and smelling like a wet dog who had rolled in a swamp.</p><p>Don\u2019t scream. Please don\u2019t scream.</p> <p>Mrs. Haffey cleared her throat. \u201cAndrea? Is that you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am. Good morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood morning. Here, I made you a carrot cake last night.\u201d She held the toweled object out to me.</p><p>I took it and sniffed, wrinkling my black nose. \u201cThank you. Smells wonderful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just wanted to thank you for Darin. We\u2019ve been together for so long. I just don\u2019t know what I would do without him.\u201d She stepped toward me and hugged me.</p><p>Oh my God, what do I do?</p><p>I hugged her back, as gently as I could, with one arm.</p><p>\u201cYou take care now,\u201d Mrs. Haffey said, smiled, and went downstairs.</p> <p>She\u2019d hugged my furry, smelly, bloodstained self. She had no idea, but I would run back into that basement and fight off a hundred of those bugs just because she hadn\u2019t screamed when she\u2019d seen me.</p><p>I needed to get inside and change into my human shape, pronto. Before any neighbors decided to call the cops because there was a monster breaking into that \u201cnice Texas girl\u2019s\u201d apartment.</p><p>I gripped the handle of my door. It turned in my hand, but my brain didn\u2019t process it right away and I slammed my shoulder into it. The door flew open with a thunderous thump and I rolled into the apartment, springing into a crouch.</p><p>My apartment smelled of Raphael. If he was still here, there was no way he wouldn\u2019t have heard me.</p><p>I kicked the door shut, snarled a little to let him know I meant business, and set out to search. A quick glance told me that my living room was Raphael-free. My bedroom was also empty, and so was my closet. I made a full circle, came to the kitchen, and stopped. My nylon mesh backpack sat in the middle of my kitchen table, with my dress and shoes still in it. My tablecloth was missing in action and long, jagged scratches covered the table\u2019s surface. The scratches looked suspiciously like letters.</p><p>I climbed on a chair and looked at it from above.</p><p>MINE.</p><p>Oh, that\u2019s great. Fantastic. So mature. Perhaps he would pull my pigtails next or stick a tack on my seat.</p><p>I shoved the table. Who did he think he was, breaking into my apartment and vandalizing my furniture? I had never done that to him. I had never ruined any of his things.</p><p>I went to shower and scrubbed myself clean.</p><p>I mean, what the hell was I even supposed to do with this MINE thing? One moment he was shoving another woman under my nose, the next he\u2019d decided we were back on and couldn\u2019t understand why I wasn\u2019t getting with the program. An old song surfaced in my memories. Love is all you need. Maybe, but in real life love was rarely all you got. Raphael and I also had pride, and guilt, and anger, jealousy and hurt feelings, and all of it was mixed into this giant Gordian knot. Untangling it seemed impossible.</p><p>Smelly, ugly, stupid bouda moron. I should\u2019ve emptied a jar of fleas in his car. It would\u2019ve been good for a laugh. It wouldn\u2019t solve anything, but it would make me feel better.</p><p>I put on my clothes, sat down at the kitchen table, tried my carrot cake\u2014it was delicious\u2014and looked at MINE some more. This was so unlike Raphael. The echoes of his roar floated up from my memory. Raphael was subtle. He seduced and enticed, and he was really good at it. So good that I had fallen for him even though I had sworn that hell would freeze over before I let a bouda touch me. This was very much unlike him. Was he really that desperate to get me back?</p><p>I wished I had been born in a different time. Somewhere in the past, before the magic, before the shapeshifters, when I could have just been a cop and done my job. When Raphael would have been a regular guy and I would have been a regular girl, and none of the complicated shapeshifter things would have gotten in the way. Or better yet, I wished the magic had never come. But that would mean that I wouldn\u2019t have experienced the magic forest. I would be slower, blinder, deafer. Weaker. No, the magic was here to stay and so was the other me. I had suppressed her for so long, and now she had taken the wheel and was giggling maniacally as she drove me off the cliff.</p><p>When I got to the office, Ascanio opened the door with an expression of profound alarm on his face. \u201cTake me with you. Please. I\u2019ll do anything.\u201d</p><p>I stepped inside the office and saw the source of his panic. It sat behind Kate\u2019s desk. It had blond hair two shades lighter than mine, wore a blue T-shirt and a black skirt with layered ruffles, and looked to an outside observer like a cute teenage girl. And she was\u2014at fourteen years old, Julie was cute and very much conscious of her position as Curran and Kate\u2019s adopted child. Most of the time she was a perfect Pack princess, polite and poised\u2014except when Derek, Kate\u2019s sidekick, or Ascanio were in the room. Derek got frosty replies studded with spikes and if Ascanio was present, she turned into a foul-mouthed sarcastic devil.</p><p>It was hard to be a teenage girl. I had been one and I didn\u2019t care to repeat the experience.</p><p>\u201cTake me with you,\u201d Ascanio begged.</p><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t go. He failed the test on the \u2018Epic of Gilgamesh,\u2019\u201d Julie said, her voice iced over. \u201cKate told him to sit here and study it.\u201d</p><p>Ascanio turned to her and said a single derision-soaked word. \u201cSnitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrybaby,\u201d Julie said.</p><p>\u201cHarpy,\u201d Ascanio said.</p><p>Julie gave him a look of concentrated scorn. \u201cPussy.\u201d</p><p>Ascanio glared at her.</p><p>Julie crossed her arms.</p><p>\u201cWhere did Kate go?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cTo the Mercenary Guild,\u201d Julie said.</p><p>Probably still trying to settle the dispute over who was going to be running the Guild. They had a bit of a power vacuum and Kate, as one of the veteran mercs, had seniority.</p><p>\u201cDid you pick up that check from the mechanic?\u201d I asked. \u201cFor that woman\u2019s vehicle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s on your desk.\u201d Ascanio turned to Julie and mouthed, \u201cBitch.\u201d</p><p>Just couldn\u2019t let it alone, could he?</p><p>\u201cIs it me or does it smell in here?\u201d Julie waved her hand in front of her nose.</p><p>Oh no, she didn\u2019t. Accusing a shapeshifter of reeking was the ultimate insult.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so dirty, Ascanio.\u201d Julie grimaced. \u201cBe careful, you might get fleas if you keep going this way.\u201d</p><p>Ascanio bared his teeth at her. \u201cBe careful you don\u2019t get lice. They\u2019ll shave you bald.\u201d</p><p>Julie rolled her eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s not necessary to shave your head if you have lice. You simply use a solution containing an extract of pyrethrin or any other of the wide variety of antilice herbal compounds and then comb the lice out. Your ignorance is staggering. I sometimes wonder how you survived to sixteen years of age. I\u2019m curious, did you live most of them in Bubble Wrap?\u201d</p><p>That kid sounded more and more like Kate every day.</p><p>\u201cI had no idea you knew so much about lice,\u201d Ascanio bit back. \u201cSpeaking from experience?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes, I am. I lived on the street for a year. Remind me, where did you live?\u201d Julie tapped her finger to her lips, pretending to think. \u201cAh yes, you lived in a religious commune, sheltered and coddled, where you spent your time trying to nail anything that moved\u2014\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s enough of that. \u201cQuiet!\u201d I barked.</p><p>Two mouths clicked shut.</p> <p>I looked at the check. It was a business check from \u201cGloria\u2019s Art and Antiques.\u201d Antiques. Why would an antique dealer visit a reclamation company unless she knew that they were bidding on a building that contained a vault full of antiques? Reclamation companies didn\u2019t deal in antiques; they dealt in metal and stone. Not much else survived a fallen building.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s the address.\u201d Ascanio handed me a piece of paper. \u201cI looked it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. Very nice of you.\u201d I looked at the address. White Street, Julie\u2019s old neighborhood. Right on the edge of the Warren, a poor part of Atlanta where beggars, gangs of homeless kids, and small-time criminals of opportunity made their home. Most of them wouldn\u2019t know what \u201cantiques\u201d meant, let alone buy them. This case was getting stranger and stranger.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t leave me here with her,\u201d Ascanio murmured.</p><p>I looked at him. \u201cDid Kate tell you to stay put?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen stay put. Study your epic, get yourself straightened out, and I\u2019ll take you with me next time.\u201d</p><p>I turned and walked out of there before he did any more begging.</p><p>White Street received its name when an unnatural snowfall covered it with two feet of pristine powder. The snow refused to melt for a couple of years and most residents had decided that discretion was the better part of valor. If a street\u2019s magic could sustain two feet of snow in the middle of the scorching Atlanta summer, there was no telling what else it could do. By the time the snow finally melted, most of the people living in its buildings had fled. As I drove down the crumbling pavement, the abandoned houses stared at me with dark rectangles of empty windows, like the black holes of a skull\u2019s orbits. If I wasn\u2019t a seasoned former member of law enforcement, I\u2019d admit that the place gave me the creeps, turn my vehicle around, and drive away screaming like a little girl.</p><p>Gloria\u2019s Art and Antiques occupied a large rectangular building. The front facade was a typical two-story brick affair, but the structure extended from the street, over a city-block deep. Enough space there to warehouse a lot of antiques. Or a small herd of tanks. Or some vicious magical elephants...</p><p>I checked my Sig-Sauers and tried the door. Unlocked. I swung it open. A little bell chimed with a silvery tone as I stepped inside. In front of me, a narrow room stretched, framed by twin glass counters. The floor was polished wood, the counters glass and steel, the walls a silvery gray. The whole place was the exact antithesis of antique.</p> <p>The air smelled of jasmine, not the purified scent of the perfume, but real jasmine: dark, slightly narcotic, with a hint of indole. There was something ancient and savage in that scent and it set my teeth on edge.</p><p>I walked over to the counter on the right and examined the contents of the glass case. A magnifying glass with an ornate metal handle. A metal toy car with faded, half-peeled-off green paint. A small round box filled with blue and white glass beads. A cheap pocket watch. Some coins, an assortment of beat-up knives, a set of antique glasses, dark red at the bottom and gold-yellow on top, a glass punch bowl with a grape pattern on the side and an odd yellow patina...This was crap. You could find pricier stuff at a flea market. Did she have a warehouse full of this junk?</p><p>A tall woman strode from the depths of the store. She wore a brown and beige suit. Her light brown hair was coiled into a complex arrangement on her head. Her eyes behind black-rimmed glasses were dark and calm. Neat, trim, professional.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d she said. \u201cCan I help you find anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi. Are you Gloria?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d The woman nodded.</p><p>\u201cMy name is Andrea Nash,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m investigating a multiple homicide on one of the Pack\u2019s business sites.\u201d</p><p>Gloria stepped behind the left counter and walked toward the door. I had to turn to keep facing her.</p> <p>\u201cMultiple homicides?\u201d</p><p>She was up to something. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho was killed?\u201d Gloria set a large plastic bin onto the counter.</p><p>\u201cSome shapeshifters. They were employees of a reclamation company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds tragic.\u201d Gloria offered me a smile. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know what it has to do with me.\u201d</p><p>She stood, one hand on the bin, her muscles tense. Normally I\u2019d make slow circles around her, pulling the evidence out of her a little at a time, but she was too keyed up for that. Strategic decision time. Anapa was likely after the ceremonial knife. She could be, too. She could be working for him even.</p><p>I took a gamble. \u201cGive me the knife, Gloria.\u201d</p><p>She hurled the contents of the bin at me. I ducked right, but not fast enough. A clump of ribbons hit me in the chest and fell apart into two dozen slithering cords around my feet.</p><p>Snakes.</p><p>The blistered bodies of Raphael\u2019s crew flashed before me. Getting bitten meant death. I jumped up and to the right, trying to put some distance between me and the knot of terrified snakes, landed on the clear floor, and drew my Sigs. Behind me a heavy metal grate slammed in place over the door.</p><p>Trapped.</p><p>I spun and saw Gloria crouching on the counter. What the hell now?</p><p>Gloria opened her mouth. Her jaws unhinged and the mandible split in half, opening even wider. Her lips curled back, baring her teeth and turning her face into a grotesque mask. Twin fangs slid from the recesses in her gums, above her human canines.</p><p>Whoa.</p><p>Gloria crouched down.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d I barked. I couldn\u2019t get bitten and I needed her alive, because whatever she knew would die with her.</p><p>Gloria jumped. It wasn\u2019t a martial arts kick. She just leaped at me like there were springs in her legs, mouth open, fangs exposed.</p><p>I fired. Two shots bit into her stomach, the third and fourth took her in the chest, and then she crashed into me. Her hands crushed my arms, pinning them to my sides. Four bullets and she hadn\u2019t even slowed down. She should\u2019ve been dead or bleeding.</p><p>I tried to rip my arms free, but she clamped me down, her hands like steel pinchers, and bit down, aiming for my throat. Hell, no. I smashed my forehead into her face. She reeled back, her nose a broken mess of red tissue. I ripped my left arm out of her grip, the second Sig still in my fingers. Gloria bit my right arm, puncturing the skin straight through my shirt, and I put the Sig to her ear and pumped three rounds into her skull.</p><p>Blood sprayed the floor, littering it with chunks of brain tissue and shattered skull bone. Gloria sagged down and crumpled by my feet.</p><p>Well, that had gone great. Gloria and her secrets were dead, and I\u2019d gotten myself bitten and was about to join her. How in the world had this gone wrong?</p><p>My arm burned. I ripped my sleeve off carefully, keeping my right arm still. A single puncture marked my arm near the elbow\u2014she had only gotten one fang in, but one was enough. The tissue around the bite had turned bright red. The beginning of a swelling stretched the skin to hot hardness.</p><p>If Raphael\u2019s people were any indication, I had minutes before the venom killed me.</p><p>The best method to prevent the spread of snake venom came from Australia and involved applying a broad tight bandage, complete with a sling and a splint to my arm. The venom had to move through the body through the lymphatic system before entering the bloodstream. The idea was to compress the tissue, preventing the lymph from moving to and from an injured limb.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t bandage myself without moving my affected arm, and even then I couldn\u2019t do it right and tight enough. All I could do was apply a tourniquet and hope my arm and I survived.</p><p>I pulled gauze from my pocket and bound my arm above the bite site, cutting off the flow of blood and lymph to my arm. It would have to do.</p><p>Gloria was still very dead on the floor. The rational, collected part of me took over. One, Gloria had giant fangs. Two, she was venomous. Three, she was connected to a reclamation company that bid on Raphael\u2019s building. If she wasn\u2019t part of the posse that had killed Raphael\u2019s people, she\u2019d definitely met them for brunch. I finally had my lead, except I was dying. If the venom finished me off, the cops would never release the crime scene to the Pack. I wasn\u2019t an official member, and I wasn\u2019t registered as a shapeshifter with the city, which made this crime scene fall into the jurisdiction of PAD. The Pack, and whoever would take over the investigation after me, would not get a crack at any evidence Gloria\u2019s body offered. I had to preserve whatever evidence I could.</p><p>I took out the Polaroid camera from the pocket on my belt, pulled the woman\u2019s lip back, and took a shot. The camera printed the photograph. I flipped it over, wrote \u201cProperty of Jim Shrapshire\u201d on it, stuck it inside my shirt, and slid the camera back. If I died, the cops would find it and ask Jim about it, which would mean he would see it and make his own conclusions. Here\u2019s hoping I hadn\u2019t just killed myself.</p><p>I walked across the floor toward the phone. A couple of snakes struck at my combat boots as I walked past, but none of them connected. I reached over and pressed the lever on the wall, raising the metal grate over the door, climbed up on the counter to get out of their range, picked up the phone, and dialed the office.</p><p>\u201cCutting Edge!\u201d Julie chirped into the phone.</p><p>\u201cGive that to me,\u201d Ascanio growled.</p><p>\u201cThis is Andrea. Put me on speaker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDone,\u201d Julie said.</p><p>\u201cListen to me very carefully. I\u2019m at Gloria\u2019s Antiques on White Street. I\u2019ve been bitten by a poisonous snake, probably a viper, the same kind that killed Raphael\u2019s people. I\u2019m dying. Call the paramedics, give them Gloria\u2019s address, tell them to bring antivenom. Next, call Doolittle and repeat what I just told you. Then call Jim and tell him the same thing. Tell him the paramedics have been called. Do not open the door of the office to anyone except Kate. Do you understand me?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d Julie said, her voice flat.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d I hung up.</p><p>My metabolism was probably twice as fast as that of a normal human.

I have too much to live for.</p><p>I just had to not move.</p><p>My breath was coming in short gasps. So much for my calm breathing. I didn\u2019t want to die.</p> <p>The pain pierced my chest. My heart fluttered. I was hot, so very hot...</p><p>A man in firefighter yellow busted through the door and swore. \u201cSnakes! There are fucking snakes in here!\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes.</p><p>\u201cRun that by me again?\u201d Detective Collins, a tall, fit, Caucasian man in his early forties, leaned toward me. \u201cShe jumped at you and you shot her four times in half a second?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I shifted inside the blanket the paramedics had wrapped me in. I was sitting in the chair, by the counter from which Gloria had leaped at me. The first responders sank fifteen vials of antivenom into my body and when that didn\u2019t quite do the trick gave me five more. My head swam and I felt cold and clammy. Any other time I\u2019d be miserable, but now being sick and woozy just confirmed that I was alive.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened next?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe grew fangs and bit me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith her fangs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Detective Tsoi, a dark-haired Asian female in her late thirties, arched her pretty eyebrows at me. \u201cSo would you say she was like a snake?\u201d</p><p>I looked at her. Behind Tsoi, Animal Control packed the last of the snakes into bins.</p><p>\u201cI just want to be sure that we\u2019re on the same page,\u201d Tsoi said. \u201cAre we talking about snake people?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Tsoi and Collins looked at each other.</p><p>\u201cEverybody knows there is no such thing as reptilian shapeshifters,\u201d Collins said.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say she was a shapeshifter.\u201d And that wasn\u2019t strictly true either. There were reptilian shapeshifters; they just weren\u2019t the product of Lyc-V.</p><p>Tsoi pondered me. \u201cYour file says you were discharged from the Order due to post-traumatic stress. You failed your psych eval?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not crazy.\u201d My head hurt and I still wanted to vomit. Every word was like a hammer to my head.</p><p>\u201cNobody says you are,\u201d Collins said. \u201cNobody even mentioned the c-word.\u201d</p><p>I took a deep breath, trying to keep what little liquid was left in my stomach from geysering out. They knew I was weak and they were trying to squeeze everything they could out of me, hoping I\u2019d slip up. I didn\u2019t blame them. In their place, I would\u2019ve done the same thing. Get as much as you can while you can. They\u2019d Mirandized me the moment I was conscious, which meant I was detained and this wasn\u2019t a routine conversation.</p><p>\u201cShe isn\u2019t crazy,\u201d the ME said, straightening from where he was examining the corpse. \u201cGot two retractable fangs here. Also something going on with her temporomandibular joint. Look at this.\u201d He pulled Gloria\u2019s lower jaw down. Her mouth gaped, not quite as wide as the maw of a snake, but far wider than any human skull had a right to open.</p><p>\u201cSnake people.\u201d Collins stared at him. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be shitting me.\u201d</p><p>The ME spread his arms. \u201cHey, I call them like I see them. I tell you fangs and a jaw that opens one hundred degrees. You can draw your own conclusions from there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t there some sort of a cult who thinks there are secret snake people?\u201d Tsoi said.</p><p>\u201cNo, those are Reptilians,\u201d the ME said. \u201cThey\u2019re supposed to be more like lizards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shot her four times,\u201d I said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t even faze her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnGarde Deluxe,\u201d the ME said. \u201cTactical concealed bulletproof vest. She was wearing one under her jacket.\u201d</p><p>Well. That explained a few things.</p><p>Collins heaved a sigh and turned to me. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>Three days ago I would have cooperated, out of habit, and because I was hardwired by the Order to play nice with the PAD. But now I was playing for the Pack\u2019s team and I would sit here and keep my mouth shut, until they sent in my backup, hopefully in the form of a lawyer. \u201cNo comment.\u201d</p><p>Collins fixed me with a heavy stare. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you drove all the way to White Street to go shopping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo comment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously? You\u2019re seriously going to do this?\u201d He sounded personally offended.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Collins shook his head. Tsoi arranged her face into a sympathetic expression. \u201cListen, all of us here know that this is connected to the four murders on your ex-boyfriend\u2019s reclamation site. Level with us. We\u2019re all good guys here. We\u2019re all on the same side.\u201d</p><p>These two were good. It had been less than two hours since the PAD uniformed cops, who had shown up right after the paramedics, had detained me at the crime scene. Collins and Tsoi, who had appeared half an hour ago, already knew who I was. They knew my job history, they knew my connection to Raphael, and they were obviously sore about losing the case of Raphael\u2019s crew to the Pack\u2019s jurisdiction. I bet they were the responding detectives to that crime scene.</p><p>I understood their frustration. Four murders in the middle of the city\u2014of shapeshifters, no less, who were stronger and faster than most\u2014didn\u2019t sit well with the general public. It\u2019s not that we were popular, but if this unknown threat could take on four shapeshifters at once, an average Joe didn\u2019t stand a chance. People tended to panic easily nowadays, and the PAD was feeling less than pleased about being locked out of the investigation.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Nash,\u201d Collins said. \u201cHelp us out here. What were you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo comment.\u201d</p><p>They stared at me. I knew that stare. I had given it myself a few times. It said, \u201cWe got you and you\u2019re not leaving, but we\u2019re willing to listen and if you just talk to us, all of this will go away.\u201d</p><p>Laymen think cops are stupid. They see some guy with a bulldog face and assume that he\u2019s dumb and they can talk their way out of whatever trouble they got themselves into. But that bulldog-faced cop has a degree, three hundred homicide investigations under his belt, and over three thousand hours in the interrogation room. You\u2019re not winning that fight. If you just stopped and thought about it, you\u2019d keep your mouth shut. But when you\u2019re put on the spot, you want to explain your side of the story. You want someone to understand, you want sympathy, and you want to get out from under that stare.</p><p>Explaining yourself is a powerful urge. I\u2019d seen people who knew better, attorneys, experienced cops, and even knights of the Order crack under pressure and say stupid things just to explain themselves. I would not be following their example.</p><p>\u201cNash, don\u2019t bullshit me. Do I need to define obstruction of justice to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo comment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAndrea, not another word.\u201d A lithe, muscular man shouldered his way to us, moving like an acrobat: graceful, sure, and weightless. He was on the near side of thirty, handsome, with green eyes and sharp features. His short hair, bright orange-red, had been brushed straight up and spiked, standing up like needles on a frightened hedgehog. Barabas. Technically, he was a member of Clan Nimble, but he\u2019d grown up in Clan Bouda. He was Kate\u2019s adviser on the Pack\u2019s law and from what Raphael had told me, nasty and vicious in a fight.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I need to define obstruction of justice for you, Detective.\u201d Barabas\u2019s face took on a dangerously focused expression. \u201c\u2018Obstruction of justice\u2019 is an attempt to interfere with administration and due process of the law. To be guilty of obstruction of justice, a person must knowingly and willfully obstruct or hinder a law enforcement officer in the lawful discharge of his official duties by violence, destruction of evidence, bribery, corruption, or deceit. Note the emphasis on deceit. Therefore, to charge my client with \u2018obstruction,\u2019 you must prove that my client has been deceitful. My client isn\u2019t lying. She\u2019s refusing to answer, as is her right under the Constitution, which, the last time I checked, was still the supreme law of this land. But nice try.\u201d</p><p>Wow. I had hoped for some backup, but Jim had sent the big guns and Air Support.</p><p>The ME waved at Barabas. Barabas waved back. \u201cHey, Mitchell. Long time, no see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d Tsoi demanded.</p><p>\u201cBarabas Gilliam.\u201d A business card materialized in Barabas\u2019s long elegant fingers. \u201cI\u2019m her attorney.\u201d</p><p>Tsoi glanced at the card. \u201cYou\u2019re a Pack lawyer. What are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorking.\u201d Barabas grinned, displaying sharp white teeth. \u201cYou see, even us dirty Pack lawyers have to pass the bar just like everyone else. If you check, you\u2019ll find that I\u2019m a member in good standing. I\u2019m licensed to practice law in the lovely State of Georgia and several of her illustrious neighbor states, which means Ms. Nash can hire me to represent her.\u201d</p><p>Tsoi pointed at me. \u201cIs she a member of the Pack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Ms. Nash is a private citizen, who has retained my services. Now I do make it a point to keep up with current legislation, but perhaps I missed something\u2014is there a new law that states a Pack attorney can\u2019t practice outside the Pack? If so, thank you ever so much for bringing it to my attention, Detective.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou think this is some sort of comedy going on here?\u201d Collins gave him his tough stare.</p><p>A little red spark flared in Barabas\u2019s eyes. \u201cExcuse me.\u201d</p><p>He struck with preternatural quickness and yanked a five-foot snake from the counter, an inch away from Tsoi\u2019s elbow. Tsoi jumped, clearing half the room in a single bound.</p> <p>The snake body flailed in my lawyer\u2019s fist. Barabas jerked the snake to his mouth and bit its neck.</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ!\u201d Collins took a step back.</p><p>Tsoi clamped her hand over her mouth.</p><p>Barabas spat the head onto the counter. \u201cPit viper\u2014my favorite. Where were we? Ah, yes. You were trying to intimidate me. I apologize for the interruption. Please, resume your staring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat snake is evidence,\u201d Collins growled.</p> <p>\u201cI would be happy to surrender it to you. Considering that I just saved your partner from being bitten, I had expected more gratitude.\u201d</p><p>Barabas offered the headless snake back to Collins. The detective grimaced and took it.</p><p>\u201cWhat sort of shapeshifter are you?\u201d Tsoi demanded.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a weremongoose,\u201d the ME told them.</p><p>Barabas smiled at me. \u201cWe\u2019re leaving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not!\u201d Tsoi said.</p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t hold her. All of us here know that. But just to be sure, let\u2019s review the facts,\u201d Barabas said. \u201cMy client, a poor defenseless woman...\u201d</p><p>Collins almost choked on his own spit.</p><p>\u201c...who came here to browse the merchandise of this shop, was attacked by a monster and killed her in self-defense. She will not be speaking to you any further, because, as we all know, anything she says to you can and will be used against her in a court of law; however, as 801(d)(2)(a) tells us, none of it can be used to help her, because anything she utters to you is hearsay. So speaking to you is of no benefit to her, whatsoever.\u201d Barabas turned to me. \u201cCan you walk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d I told him. \u201cI haven\u2019t tried.\u201d</p><p>Barabas picked me up, like I weighed nothing. \u201cWill there be anything else, Detectives?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe isn\u2019t Pack, so don\u2019t even think of claiming this is a Pack scene,\u201d Tsoi growled.</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t dream of it.\u201d Barabas strode out of the door and into the sunshine.</p><p>He walked down the street. \u201cI parked on the side so they couldn\u2019t block me in. It\u2019s a fun tactic they use\u2014they\u2019ll park behind you and try to grill you while they take their sweet time moving their vehicle. Are you okay?\u201d</p> <p>I nodded. I was so happy to be out of there. \u201cBarabas, if you weren\u2019t batting for the other team, I\u2019d marry you.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cIf I weren\u2019t batting for the other team, I would accept your proposal. You had me at \u2018No comment.\u2019 If all my clients were this smart, my life would be much easier. Much, much easier.\u201d</p><p>He paused by a Pack Jeep, opened the passenger door, and carefully loaded me inside.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo your office. It\u2019s closer than your apartment and better fortified. Doolittle is already there and he\u2019s awaiting your arrival with all sorts of needles and torture devices.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d I murmured.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s very excited. It will be fun,\u201d Barabas promised and started the engine.</p><p>As we pulled out of the parking lot, my stomach pirouetted inside me. \u201cYou won\u2019t tell anyone about carrying me, will you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be our special secret,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 10</p><p>Doolittle was a very nice man. He looked to be in his early fifties, although he was probably older\u2014shapeshifters lived longer and looked younger than most regular people. His skin was dark, almost blue-black; silvery gray salted his short dark hair; he spoke in a soft voice with a soothing Southern accent; and the glasses he insisted on wearing combined with a slightly absent-minded look in his eyes made him resemble a kindly college professor, someone who specialized in history or anthropology and spent his life in an office full of books. You half expected him to sit you down to have a heart-to-heart about some long-forgotten civilization and reassure you that really a B on your paper wasn\u2019t so bad.</p><p>However, the moment any kind of injury, no matter how trivial, manifested itself, Doolittle turned into a stubborn, disagreeable tyrant, who treated you like you were six years old. He served as the Pack\u2019s medmage. He set broken bones, he removed silver and other foreign objects, he sewed up wounds, and generally spent his every waking minute making sure that the shapeshifters of the Pack remained breathing. And he went about it with the dogged persistence that made his animal counterpart so famous. If there were any laws of nature, one of them surely said that arguing with a honeybadger was futile.</p><p>The second I stepped across the threshold, Doolittle placed me into a chair. He drew my blood and examined the bite site on my foot and the bigger one on my shoulder, which had acquired a plum-purple swelling. Barabas recounted the scene, while Julie and Ascanio hovered in the background, quiet like two mice.</p><p>\u201cPit vipers?\u201d Doolittle asked, checking my eyes.</p><p>\u201cAppears so. At least the one I caught was. Not a rattlesnake, though.\u201d Barabas shrugged. \u201cThree-inch fangs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNauseous?\u201d Doolittle asked me.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I was still sweating, too. The sweat drenched my face and my back, clammy and cold, and my heart was beating too fast. The bite on my arm hadn\u2019t sealed itself either. That was a bad sign. Lyc-V closed most wounds in minutes.</p><p>Someone pounded on the office door. Barabas moved to the door, slid aside the metal shutter covering the narrow spy window, and looked through it.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your lover man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBarabas, open the damn door,\u201d Raphael snarled.</p><p>Barabas slid the shutter closed. \u201cDo you want me to let him in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking about it.\u201d</p><p>Barabas slid the shutter open. \u201cShe\u2019s thinking about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAndrea,\u201d Raphael called. \u201cLet me in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe last time I saw you two together, you were so happy,\u201d Barabas said. \u201cJust out of curiosity, Raphael, how the hell did you manage to fuck that up?\u201d</p><p>Raphael\u2019s voice gained that dangerous, I\u2019m-about-to-go-nuts quality. \u201cRemind me, how are things with you and Ethan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of your business,\u201d Barabas said.</p><p>\u201cLet me in and I won\u2019t rip your head off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t rip my head off anyway,\u201d Barabas said. \u201cWe\u2019re friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet him in,\u201d I said. If we didn\u2019t let him in, he wouldn\u2019t go away. He would just stand by the door and him and Barabas would yell obscenities at each other. My head hurt enough as it was.</p><p>Barabas swung the door open, and Raphael marched in. He saw me and turned pale.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t agitate her,\u201d Doolittle warned.</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t dream of it.\u201d Raphael pulled up a chair and sat next to me.</p><p>Doolittle shined a light into my eyes, listened to my heartbeat, and thrust a glass of some murky liquid into my hand. \u201cDrink this.\u201d</p><p>I took a tiny sip. It tasted like someone had mixed kerosene with turpentine. \u201cThis is awful.\u201d</p><p>Doolittle peered at me through his glasses. \u201cNow, young lady, you will drain that glass. If I can drop everything and rush over here, at the very least you can repay me for my kindness by taking your medicine.\u201d</p><p>I gulped the drink. It burned my throat and I coughed. \u201cDoc, you\u2019re trying to kill me...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrink a bit more,\u201d Raphael said.</p><p>I pointed at him. \u201cYou heard what the medic said. Don\u2019t agitate me.\u201d</p><p>I bravely took another swallow of the nasty stuff, trying to force it down and keep it there.</p><p>\u201cVery good,\u201d Doolittle approved. \u201cI seem to recall that I warned you not to confront that snake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe snake confronted me. That is, the woman with snake fangs confronted me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you finish the whole glass, I\u2019ll give you a lollipop.\u201d</p><p>There was something deeply absurd about this entire conversation. \u201cStop treating me like a child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will if you take ownership of your predicament and take your medicine.\u201d Doolittle looked at Barabas. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you saw the snake woman in question?\u201d</p><p>Barabas shook his head. \u201cThe second I walked in, the ME blocked her head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch a shame.\u201d</p><p>I took another gulp\u2014I\u2019d never tasted anything more vile; I\u2019d drink warm milk with baking soda before this stuff\u2014and pulled the Polaroid out of my bra.</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>Raphael took the Polaroid out of my fingers and handed it to Barabas without a word.</p><p>My lawyer\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cWhy does it say \u2018Property of Jim Shrapshire\u2019 on it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause that\u2019s Jim\u2019s real name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t explain anything,\u201d Barabas said.</p><p>\u201cIf I died, the PAD would claim the scene and the Pack would be locked out of the investigation. There was a good chance that they wouldn\u2019t let the Pack examine Gloria\u2019s body. But when they found the Polaroid on my body, they would show it to Jim and ask him about it. He would know to look for her known associates with retractable fangs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were bitten and your priority was to take pictures?\u201d Barabas said.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t agitate her,\u201d Raphael told him.</p><p>\u201cIt seemed important at the time.\u201d</p><p>Barabas looked at Raphael. \u201cHow do you put up with that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJob first. That\u2019s the way she\u2019s wired,\u201d Raphael told him.</p><p>Doolittle emitted a long-suffering sigh. \u201cYou know snakebite emergency procedures. You can\u2019t even claim ignorance. This was just willful disregard of your life, that\u2019s exactly what that was.\u201d</p><p>The weremongoose and the werehoneybadger peered at the photograph.</p><p>\u201cFolded fangs,\u201d Barabas said. \u201cLike a rattlesnake.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOr a saw-scaled viper.\u201d Doolittle frowned. \u201cWhat is this world coming to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so special about a saw-scaled viper?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a fun little snake,\u201d Barabas said. \u201cSmall, bad-tempered, active after dark. You walk by it, it bites you, you think nothing of it. Twenty-four hours later you develop spontaneous internal bleeding. Kills more people than any other snake species in Africa. It\u2019s also delicious and has a tangy aftertaste.\u201d</p> <p>I drank my nasty medicine and connected the dots for them: Garcia Construction, drag marks of a towed vehicle, mechanic, check with Gloria\u2019s name on it, and Gloria attacking me when I mentioned the knife.</p><p>\u201cSo it is the knife we saw when we broke in to Anapa\u2019s office,\u201d Raphael said.</p><p>Barabas stuck his fingers in his ears. \u201cLalalala, I\u2019m not hearing anything about any break-in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I told Raphael. \u201cThey\u2019re all after it.\u201d</p><p>He frowned.</p> <p>I finished the last of the medicine and put the glass on the table. \u201cI want my lollipop. I\u2019ve earned it.\u201d</p><p>Doolittle reached into his bag and offered me a choice: grape, watermelon, or orange. No-brainer. I took the watermelon and stuck it in my mouth. \u201cSo why does she have fangs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s some sort of magic augmentation,\u201d Doolittle said. \u201cPerhaps it\u2019s a creature we\u2019ve never seen before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer fang span is similar to the bite wounds on Raphael\u2019s employees.\u201d</p><p>Doolittle nodded. \u201cSimilar, but unfortunately we can\u2019t know for sure, because we don\u2019t have her head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlso, there were multiple bites of varying sizes on their bodies,\u201d I said.</p> <p>\u201cWhich means her friends are still at large,\u201d Raphael finished.</p><p>\u201cPeople walking around with venomous fangs,\u201d I interrupted. \u201cHow is that even possible?\u201d</p><p>Doolittle glanced at me with a wry smile. \u201cHow is it possible that we grow fur, fangs, and claws?\u201d</p><p>Touch\u00e9.</p><p>Doolittle checked my blood in the test tube and took a fat leather roll from his bag. \u201cThe blood coagulation is still abnormal.\u201d He unrolled the leather kit on my desk. Odd metal instruments gleamed, each in a neat leather pocket. It looked like the kind of toolkit a medieval torturer would carry around. Doolittle\u2019s hand paused over the scalpel.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to cut me, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Doolittle nodded. \u201cThat purple swelling on your arm is the accumulation of dead Lyc-V combined with trapped venom. We must purge it from your system. Do you remember how to push silver from your body?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Not something you\u2019d forget.</p> <p>Doolittle pulled up a chair and sat next to me so our eyes were level. \u201cI need to make a cut on your arm and insert a needle into the muscle affected by the bite. The needle is made of a silver alloy.\u201d</p><p>It would hurt. Oh yes. It would hurt like hell.</p><p>Raphael reached over and covered my hand with his.</p><p>\u201cWe must give it a few minutes for your body to react,\u201d Doolittle said. \u201cThen I want you to concentrate on pushing the needle out. This will stimulate blood and lymph flow to the wound and expel the poison. If we purge the poison, your chances of survival will be significantly higher.\u201d</p><p>The tiny hairs on the back of my neck stood on their ends. I was tired, so tired, and my body felt like it had been beaten with a sack of rocks. The mere thought of silver needles made me want to cringe.</p><p>\u201cYou can do it,\u201d Raphael said. \u201cStop being a baby about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScrew you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d he said. \u201cCome on, tough guy. Show me what you\u2019ve got.\u201d</p><p>I clenched the chair\u2019s armrests. \u201cDo it.\u201d</p><p>Raphael put his hands on my right shoulder, pinning me to the chair. Barabas clamped me from the left.</p><p>Doolittle took a scalpel. His hand flashed, too quickly to see. Pain stung me, quick and sharp. Black blood gushed from the wound, and Doolittle wiped it with gauze. \u201cThis will sting.\u201d</p><p>A white-hot needle thrust into my arm. My entire body screamed in alarm. It felt like someone had bored a hole in my muscle and poured molten metal into it.</p><p>\u201cHold it in,\u201d Doolittle told me, his voice gentle. \u201cYou\u2019re doing wonderful. Wonderful. Hold it. A little longer...\u201d</p><p>I growled and clawed at the armrest with my left hand. Barabas held me tight.</p><p>\u201cDid you like my message on the table?\u201d Raphael asked.</p><p>\u201cLoved it,\u201d I ground out through clenched teeth. \u201cI\u2019ll have to repay the favor later.\u201d</p><p>The pain grew and grew, inflaming my arm. I shuddered, my limbs shaking.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t change shape,\u201d Doolittle said. \u201cYou\u2019re doing fine. You\u2019re doing very well. Just a little bit more. Hold on for me, Andrea.\u201d</p><p>The pain ate its way through my muscle all the way to the bone and scraped it with sharp serrated teeth. I snarled.</p><p>\u201cAaalmost there,\u201d Doolittle crooned. \u201cAlmost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe got you,\u201d Barabas told me. \u201cWe got you.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t take it. I couldn\u2019t take another second. My body twisted, looking for a way to escape. Faint spots appeared on my skin.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t change shape,\u201d Raphael snapped.</p><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe good or I\u2019ll kiss you in front of everybody.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell no,\u201d I snarled. I had to hold on and live through this so I could punch him in the face. It was a great goal.</p><p>\u201cHold on,\u201d Doolittle told me. \u201cTen more seconds.\u201d</p><p>Aaah. It hurts. It hurts, hurrts, hurrrrrts...</p><p>\u201cExpel,\u201d Doolittle\u2019s voice snapped.</p><p>I concentrated every ounce of my will on the pain.</p><p>Heat spread through me, combing through my flesh with spiked fingers.</p><p>Get out of my body. Get the hell out!</p><p>The needle shivered.</p><p>I cried out.</p><p>\u201cExpel it,\u201d Doolittle urged.</p><p>\u201cYou can do it,\u201d Barabas told me.</p><p>I pushed. The needle slid free and scalding-hot blood gushed down my arm. It ran gray, purple, and then finally bright red. Raphael let go of my arm and I punched him in the chest. It was the closest part of him.</p><p>\u201cGood girl.\u201d Doolittle exhaled. \u201cWell done.\u201d</p><p>I wiped tears from my eyes and saw Ascanio. He stared at me. His eyes were huge and terrified.</p><p>\u201cLet that be a lesson to you,\u201d Doolittle told him. \u201cDon\u2019t get bitten. Bring the meat from the refrigerator. Andrea needs to eat.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s amazing how much good a sandwich, or three, can do for you. My head had stopped spinning and I no longer felt like my legs wouldn\u2019t support me. I eyed the dwindling ham, from which Julie had carved the meat for my sandwiches. No more food would physically fit into my stomach, but I was still hungry.</p><p>Doolittle set a small plastic box down in front of me and flipped open the top. Six small ampoules in a neat row.</p><p>\u201cAntivenom,\u201d he said and showed me a gun-looking object. \u201cOne ampoule goes in here. Once you hear a click, press it against the skin and pull the trigger. Not for use on humans. It is in the form of a gun, so you should have no difficulties using it.\u201d</p><p>An antivenom gun\u2014load, press, squeeze the trigger. Okay, I could do that.</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, that is all I can do until I know more,\u201d Doolittle said. He leaned closer and looked into my eyes. \u201cI strongly advise against any physical activity for the next twenty-four to forty-eight hours. Nothing strenuous. No sexual relations, no running, and no fighting. Do you understand me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfectly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not naive enough to think that you\u2019ll heed my advice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI solemnly swear to heed at least one-third of it. No sexual relations won\u2019t be a problem.\u201d</p><p>Barabas laughed under his breath.</p><p>Doolittle shook his head. \u201cShould you feel faint, you will take another dose of antivenom and you will lie down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>Doolittle shook his head again and went to pack up his tools. Barabas stepped into his place and leaned against my desk, his arms folded over his chest. \u201cAs your attorney, I\u2019m forced to advise you to stay away from that crime scene. We both know you won\u2019t, but if you get caught, there will be repercussions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for the warning.\u201d Now I had advice from both a doctor and a lawyer. I tried to fight a yawn, but it won. \u201cI\u2019ll definitely take it under consideration.\u201d</p><p>I had to go back to the scene. Everyone in the room knew it.</p><p>\u201cAlso, you won\u2019t like hearing this, but as a lawyer, I\u2019m used to that. Your position with the Pack is muddy. This makes things a hell of a lot more complicated than they have to be. Sort yourself out.\u201d</p><p>Settle things with the woman who sent two boudas to beat the crap out of me. Right.</p><p>Barabas looked at Julie. \u201cPlease get your bag. We\u2019re going back to the Keep.\u201d</p><p>Julie crossed her arms. \u201cBut...\u201d</p><p>\u201cJulia,\u201d Barabas said calmly. \u201cPlease get your bag.\u201d</p><p>Julie stomped to the kitchen and returned with her backpack.</p><p>My eyes were apparently producing glue instead of moisture, because I had trouble keeping them open. \u201cTake Ascanio with you, too,\u201d I said. The boy was looking really rattled.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Raphael said.</p><p>I turned to him. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to give orders here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still his alpha. Ascanio or me, one of us will stay here with you and stand guard while you sleep. Gloria is dead and now her friends and relations might be looking for you. You can barely keep your eyes open. I don\u2019t care how good this door is, you need someone awake and alert in case they show up. That can be Ascanio if you prefer, but I\u2019m more than happy to lie in the bed with you and hold you while you sleep. It\u2019s your choice.\u201d</p><p>There came a point in everyone\u2019s life when they were just too tired to argue. I opened my mouth and realized I had hit that point. If they weren\u2019t gone in the next half minute, I\u2019d fall asleep sitting up. \u201cI\u2019ll take the kid.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ascanio blinked. Julie stomped on his foot as she passed him and he elbowed her in the ribs.</p><p>\u201cCall me if anything,\u201d Barabas told me.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p> <p>A moment later and both the lawyer and the doctor were gone. Raphael and I looked at each other.</p><p>\u201cGo away,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cFor now,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll be back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t let you through the door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see about that.\u201d Raphael turned to Ascanio. \u201cGuard her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, Alpha.\u201d</p><p>He walked out. Ascanio locked and barred the door behind him.</p><p>I pondered whether it was worth it to force myself upstairs to the bed or if I should just lie down on the nice comfortable wooden floor. My dignity won. I was a badass, God damn it. I could take twelve stairs. I\u2019d kick their ass.</p><p>I dragged myself to the upstairs cot and collapsed facedown. I tried to take my shoes off, but the world slipped through my fingers before I had a chance to raise my head from my pillow.</p><p>\u201cAndrea?\u201d Ascanio whispered next to me.</p><p>I opened my eyes.</p> <p>He was crouching by my cot. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to wake you up. My mother is outside the door. Can I let her in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you can let her in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>He took off. I rubbed my eyes and sat up. The windup clock on the night table by the cot said seven p.m. Every cell in my body ached. Below, the bar clanged\u2014Ascanio was opening the door. I forced myself upright, crossed the loft, and sat down on top of the stairs.</p><p>Ascanio swung the door open and stood aside. Martina came in. She had a rare look to her, a kind of regal beauty on the crossroads of severe and sensual, but not really leaning toward either. Her dark hair crowned her head in a braided updo coil. Her tan skin was flawless. Her features were large and boldly cut, and she held herself with great poise, so self-possessed with quiet confidence that people gravitated to her. Barabas called her Queen Martina. She wore jeans and an olive-colored blouse, but the nickname still fit.</p><p>Ascanio closed the door, locked it, and stood there awkwardly. I\u2019d never seen him awkward before.</p><p>\u201cHow are you?\u201d Martina reached over to touch his cheek, but stopped before the actual contact, as if she\u2019d thought better of it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good...Thank you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI brought you your favorite,\u201d she said, handing him a basket.</p><p>Ascanio took the towel off the basket and smiled. It was a shy little kid smile, so at odds with his teenage Don Juan persona, I almost did a double take.</p><p>\u201cYou should eat those,\u201d she said.</p><p>Ascanio glanced at me.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Martina said. \u201cGo on. I\u2019ll visit with Andrea.\u201d</p><p>Ascanio took the basket, leaned over, and kissed his mother on the cheek. Then he turned and went into the kitchen.</p><p>Martina climbed the stairs and sat next to me.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s in the basket?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cCannoli,\u201d she said. \u201cHe really likes them.\u201d</p><p>And she had come all the way here, an hour from the Keep, just to bring them. Something wasn\u2019t quite right.</p><p>\u201cDid Raphael ever tell you our story?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I knew that for some reason Ascanio hadn\u2019t lived with the clan for a while, but that was about it.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI was young and living in the Midwest. I wasn\u2019t bitten\u2014I was born a bouda. My mother was a bouda also, my father was a werewolf. I had the best family, Andrea. I was so loved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d I asked. Funny, I thought that all her self-assurance would create a distance, but she seemed so nice. Her voice just put me at ease.</p><p>\u201cWe had a flood,\u201d she said. \u201cOne of those insane freak floods that sometimes hits states like Iowa. The river swelled and took down our town. We were sitting on the roof, and my mother saw our neighbors floating by in the car, their kids in the backseat. The car was sinking and everyone was screaming. The car went under. My mother was stronger than my father, so she went in after it. She didn\u2019t come back. My dad dived in to get her out. He didn\u2019t come back either. I sat there on the roof and cried and screamed and screamed and begged God to let them come back, but there was nothing but muddy river.\u201d</p><p>I could picture her sitting on the roof, crying her eyes out. \u201cThat\u2019s awful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. My grandparents took me in, but it wasn\u2019t the same. I left as soon as I could and traveled around, doing odd jobs here and there, bouncing at bars, waitressing in diners. I was kind of wild. If a guy had nice eyes and nice biceps, I was game.\u201d She smiled, a little spark in her eyes. \u201cLooking for love in all the wrong places. I had fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you find Mr. Right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI found many Misters Right-for-Now. None of them lasted very long. I didn\u2019t know it back then, because I was young and stupid, but the kind of great love I was looking for couldn\u2019t happen for me back then. I didn\u2019t even know what kind of person I wanted to be, let alone what I needed from a guy. But I wanted that love I lost, so I had this bright idea: I would get pregnant and have a baby. A baby would love me no matter what, because I\u2019d be her mommy. We would be a little family together. It would be just like it was before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s never like it was before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that now, but back then I was selfish and damaged, and very young. About that time I met Ascanio\u2019s father. John was gorgeous. Beautiful man. And a bouda like me. A little on the passive side, but he was kind and very proper. Seducing him was so much fun and once I did, he just did whatever I said. I was okay with being in charge. We were together for two months when I got pregnant. I was so happy. I told him and he cried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe cried? Like in joy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore like in horror.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no.\u201d</p><p>Martina nodded. \u201cYes, that should have been a clue. Apparently John grew up in this religious cult worshipping some made-up god, and he had been sent out in the world for a year-long pilgrimage. He came to terms about \u2018sinning\u2019 with me\u2014probably because I was very good at sinning and he liked it\u2014but a child threw him for a loop. We couldn\u2019t have a child in sin, and he refused to marry me unless we went back and had his prophet do it. The catch was I\u2019d have to sleep with said prophet to have my body purified.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cScrew that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was my reaction. It\u2019s my body and I wouldn\u2019t be abused in this manner. It also let me know real quick that John wasn\u2019t good husband/father material. I told him he was free to hit the road. Me and my baby would be just fine. But John had a change of heart and stuck around. I should\u2019ve twisted his head off right then, but silly me, I thought he had come about because he loved me. I went into labor. The hospital had never had a shapeshifter give birth before and mine was a long and terrible thing. Then I got to hold Ascanio and it was all worth it. He was so beautiful. I was reading this French book at the time about a sculptor and he had this ridiculously good-looking apprentice, whose name was Ascanio. I knew exactly what to name my baby. The hospital sedated me after that to let me rest. When I woke up, my beautiful baby was gone. John took him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe took him back to his cult. He left me a note, the slime. It said that he couldn\u2019t let his son be raised in sin, and since Ascanio was an innocent, he\u2019d be taking him away, but I couldn\u2019t come, because I was tainted by our sin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would have killed him. I would\u2019ve murdered him right there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried,\u201d Martina said. \u201cI looked for him for years. I was bitter and broken by then, and that\u2019s when Aunt B came across me. She was on a trip of some sort. I was, well, the proper term is fucked up. I hadn\u2019t shifted into my animal shape for years. Didn\u2019t seem like there was any point to it. It only brought me misery. She went after me. \u2018Come be with your own kind. You don\u2019t have to do anything. Just come, live with us for a bit, and if you don\u2019t like it, you\u2019re free to go.\u2019 Eventually I went with her. It didn\u2019t matter one way or another. So I came here and slowly, little by little, I thawed out. Then the call came. The cult\u2019s prophet decided my boy was too much competition and was mucking up his harem plans, so he called us to come and get him. We did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd John?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019d died a while back. A good thing too, because I would\u2019ve killed him. So you see it\u2019s difficult for us both,\u201d Martina said. \u201cAscanio never had a mother and I never had a son. We try the best we can and when we find something that can make one of us happy, we both sigh a little in relief. I make him cannoli and he buys me scented soap with his Cutting Edge money. I have two drawers full of it.\u201d A small happy smile lit up her face. \u201cIf you ever run out, you let me know. I\u2019ve got enough to keep the whole Pack clean for a week.\u201d</p><p>I really liked her. I hadn\u2019t known I would, but I did. Still, things had to be said. \u201cYou didn\u2019t come here to tell me this story, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I came here to talk about the clan and Aunt B.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean to be rude,\u201d I said. \u201cBut there is nothing you can say to make me play ball with Aunt B. I won\u2019t go over there and I won\u2019t beg and scrape to be admitted into the clan, so I can be one of her girls and run her errands. That won\u2019t be happening. And I think it\u2019s cowardly of her to send you in for this talk. Enforcers didn\u2019t work, neither will you, so I wonder what her next move is going to be. How many will she send?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t send me,\u201d Martina said. \u201cMy son did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know what I do for the clan?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a licensed therapist,\u201d she said. \u201cI specialize in the areas of family therapy, anger and stress management, adolescent adjustment, and loss and grief counseling. I\u2019m one of ten Pack counselors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not in the Pack,\u201d I told her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI know.\u201d She smiled. \u201cThis is a freebie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need therapy.\u201d It sounded hypocritical the moment it left my mouth. \u201cOkay, so maybe I do, but I don\u2019t...I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis doesn\u2019t have to be a therapy session,\u201d she said. \u201cThis could be just the two of us talking.

In his words, \u2018They\u2019re trying to punk her in her own place.\u2019 He\u2019s worried you\u2019ll kill someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s right,\u201d I told her.</p><p>Martina took out a small recorder. \u201cI made this for you.\u201d</p><p>She pressed the button. Aunt B\u2019s voice sounded from the tiny speaker.</p> <p>\u201c...I said to go over there and find out what they talked about. I said to be slick about it. Did I say to rough anybody up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, ma\u2019am,\u201d Carrie said quietly.</p><p>\u201cSo why would you take it upon yourselves to improvise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe thought...\u201d Deb started and fell silent.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t do so much of that, if I were you, dear. When you think, you end up with broken bones. Besides, it makes me so happy when you let me do your thinking for you. You do want to make me happy, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes ma\u2019am,\u201d two female voices chorused.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll explain things to you now, because I don\u2019t want you to feel left out. You thought that because Andrea is beastkin, you could easily dominate her. Andrea is a survivor. Never underestimate that. She learned to kill, she trained for it, and she\u2019s had practice. You fight for fun and dominance. She fights every battle as if it\u2019s for her life. If you attack her, she will pull you apart like a badly sewn dress. Andrea also understands how the forces that uphold human law work. And we all know how important that is, don\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>Another chorus. \u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you understand now why she would be an asset to the clan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>I was an asset. That was news to me.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care if she is beastkin, elephant, or platypus, we need her. She\u2019s like a pine. She won\u2019t bend, she will only break. I\u2019ve spent months trying to convince her that joining us was in her best interests and the two of you decided to throw a wrench into my plans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Carrie said.</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d Deb echoed.</p> <p>\u201cGo away and do try to stay away from me for a day or two, yes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>The door closed. A terrible screech followed, the sound of metal being tortured.</p><p>\u201cIt was a very nice bookend,\u201d Martina\u2019s voice said.</p><p>\u201cWell, now it\u2019s a very nice piece of junk,\u201d Aunt B said.</p><p>I glanced at Martina. \u201cWas that an owl?\u201d It was one of a gorgeous pair of bookends, metal and finished in pale bronze, with large amber Swarovski crystals for the eyes. Aunt B used them on her desk to keep the files from falling out of the file holder.</p><p>Martina stopped the recording and nodded. \u201cShe squeezed one in her hand. If you crushed a jelly doughnut in your fist, and the filling spilled out? That\u2019s what it looked like.\u201d She pushed the button.</p><p>\u201cDid Ascanio say what Andrea and Raphael spoke about?\u201d Aunt B asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. He did bring Rebecca there.\u201d</p><p>The recorder fell silent.</p><p>Aunt B sighed. \u201cWhy is it that we sacrifice and work so hard to keep our children from making our mistakes, and they insist on ignoring everything we say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably because they are our children and at their age we ignored our parents also.\u201d</p><p>Aunt B sighed again. \u201cAre you going to see her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you tell me how it goes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know that anything she says to me is confidential,\u201d Martina said.</p><p>\u201cI know. Just tell me if it\u2019s salvageable or not. We need her.\u201d</p><p>Martina shut off the recorder and put it down between us.</p><p>\u201cThis doesn\u2019t change anything,\u201d I told her.</p><p>Martina looked at me. \u201cWhat\u2019s the alternative, Andrea? Where do you see this situation going? You slapped her, in public.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe backhanded me down the stairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was a gentle love tap compared to what she could\u2019ve done. You challenged her. She can\u2019t ignore you. You wouldn\u2019t, in her place.\u201d</p><p>No, I wouldn\u2019t. I would\u2019ve gone after me. Quick, too.</p><p>\u201cYou can leave,\u201d Martina said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not leaving. This is my home now. Why should I leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen joining the Pack is your only choice. You can\u2019t be unattached, Andrea. It is our law and you are subject to it, because you are a shapeshifter. You are one of us.\u201d</p><p>I clenched my teeth. \u201cI could fight her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would lose. But suppose you won,\u201d Martina said. \u201cThen what? I won\u2019t follow you, Andrea. You didn\u2019t fight beside me; you didn\u2019t prove to me that you deserve to lead. I don\u2019t know you and I don\u2019t trust you. If you succeeded and killed Aunt B, we would all gang up on you. I don\u2019t know where Raphael\u2019s allegiances would lie, but he would have to choose between the woman he loves and his family. It is a lousy choice to make.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRaphael and I are at a complicated place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t doubt it. We\u2019re boudas, after all.\u201d Martina shrugged. \u201cIf a woman sees her boyfriend in a restaurant with another woman, she may march over and confront him there. She may wait and confront him later. But if a bouda sees another woman with her mate, she would throw her drink in his face, and then the table, and then perhaps an unlucky member of the restaurant staff if one happened to be nearby. We make dramatic statements, in fight and in love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLife would be easier without the drama,\u201d I told her.</p><p>\u201cNot for us. We have to vent, Andrea. That\u2019s the way we\u2019re wired. But back to the clan. B\u2019s current second isn\u2019t fit to be in charge of the clan. She is beta, because nobody else wants the job and responsibility. We would be left leaderless and have to fight it out. Would you really be that selfish, Andrea?\u201d</p><p>She was right. I wouldn\u2019t be. I didn\u2019t want to be governed by shapeshifter laws, and some long-forgotten teenage part of me wanted to stomp my feet and scream that it wasn\u2019t fair. But it was. A citizen of the country was subject to its laws, and while some people thought it was unfair, they still had to obey them. When they didn\u2019t, people like me arrested them.</p><p>I didn\u2019t want to be treated special because I was beastkin. But I was, because I had forced the situation into a corner, and now everyone was making special allowances for me.</p><p>What did I really have to lose by joining the clan? B was right, I did have the proper tools. I could join, take a position of responsibility, prove myself, and when the time came, I would take the boudas away from Aunt B.</p><p>I puzzled over this thought, turning it this way and that in my mind. \u201cLogically I know you are right. Everything you said makes sense. But it feels like giving up somehow.\u201d</p><p>Martina nodded. \u201cYou feel like your hand is being forced, and you have to join the Pack not because you want to, but because you must to do it to survive. This is your home and you want to live here on your terms, not the Pack\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it you want to do in life, Andrea?\u201d</p><p>I looked at her. I had no idea how to answer.</p><p>\u201cEach of us selects a purpose,\u201d Martina said. \u201cMine is to help people heal themselves. What\u2019s yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d I told her.</p><p>Martina smiled. \u201cSomething to think about.\u201d</p><p>I was a shapeshifter. Nobody could take it away from me. Nobody could force me into early retirement and the boudas needed me. But I had no idea what my goal in life was. I had never thought about it in grand terms.</p><p>\u201cThank you for coming by,\u201d I said. \u201cWill you tell Aunt B I will be visiting her in a day or two?\u201d</p><p>Martina nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll let her know.\u201d</p><p>I catnapped after Martina and Ascanio left and heard the phone ring through my sleep. By the time I made it downstairs, the answering machine had kicked in.</p><p>\u201cAndi, it\u2019s me,\u201d Raphael said.</p><p>I stepped away from the phone.</p><p>\u201cI went to see Garcia Senior,\u201d he said. \u201cHe says that they were approached by Gloria Dahl and asked to bid on Blue Heron. I thought maybe Gloria and Anapa were working together. It would make sense: he would put in a bid and she would put in the second-highest bid, so in case something went wrong with his bid, he\u2019d still get the building. But Garcia said that Gloria\u2019s bid was almost eighty grand below mine, which would make it one hundred and fifteen thousand below Anapa\u2019s. Basically, she had no chance. If they were working together, their bids would be closer together. Anapa bid way too high and she bid way too low.\u201d</p><p>Huh. I could\u2019ve sworn Gloria was Anapa\u2019s flunky. Well, showed what I knew.</p><p>\u201cI hope you went home,\u201d Raphael said. \u201cI\u2019ll be driving by later. Don\u2019t do anything stupid without me.\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t do anything stupid without him. I wouldn\u2019t be doing anything with him, stupid or otherwise.</p><p>I checked the world outside the window. It was a few minutes past nine and the evening sky was vast and dark. Perfect.</p><p>I had to go back to Gloria\u2019s crime scene. It was highly likely that Gloria, whoever or whatever she was, and her pals must have murdered Raphael\u2019s people. That explained both the wide fang spawn and the location of the bite wounds. But I had no concrete proof. I didn\u2019t have access to Gloria\u2019s corpse, so I couldn\u2019t measure the exact distance between her fangs and I still didn\u2019t know where her associates were or what she was after. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I had a good suspicion that the knife in the photo that I\u2019d seen in Anapa\u2019s office was involved. In fact, I was sure of it, but again I had to obtain evidence of that. I had to figure out what the knife was and what it was for, and the only way to shed light on this situation would be to break into the crime scene and I would have to do it alone. If I got caught, I\u2019d be detained, but I was just a private citizen. If anyone from the Pack was detained with me, the matter would take on a completely different light.</p><p>Everything inside me hurt. I felt like I\u2019d been chewed up by a beast with small sharp teeth. My bones felt so heavy, you\u2019d think they were made of lead.</p><p>I didn\u2019t want to go anywhere. I just wanted to lie there and fall asleep so I wouldn\u2019t hurt anymore. But there were people dependent on me for answers and I wouldn\u2019t get those answers by taking time out to rest. Besides, with the magic down, now was the best time to search the room. Who knew how long technology would last?</p> <p>Come on, Ms. Nash. Get your ass in gear.</p><p>I forced myself to sit up. Doolittle had said no physical activity, but time was of the essence. I\u2019d just have to take it easy.</p><p>I drove to Pucker Alley two blocks from White Street and hid the car in the shadow of a ruin. A vast, cloudless sky stretched above me, and the night was gauzy with curtains of silvery moonlight. Just my luck. I grabbed my duffel bag out of the backseat and pulled it open. It held my emergency kit: matches in a plastic bag, gauze, antibiotic ointment, Band-Aids, knife, roll of duct tape, flask of alcohol, bottle of water, an MRE\u2014a Meal Ready to Eat courtesy of the United States Army\u2014spare knife, rope, gloves, hat, and a towel. I had once read a book that said a traveler should always have one and it made a lot of sense.</p><p>I slipped on the gloves, hid my hair under the hat, zipped the duffel, and set off.</p><p>My forehead immediately began to sweat under the cotton hat. Hats and muggy Atlanta spring didn\u2019t exactly play nice. But I\u2019d suffer a little sweat to keep from leaving stray hairs at the scene to be found by PAD crime techs.</p> <p>The street in front of Gloria\u2019s Antiques looked very much the same, deserted and foreboding. No sign of the cops\u2019 presence remained. I had figured as much. Atlanta was a busy city and the PAD was stretched thin. They\u2019d likely resume processing the scene tomorrow.</p><p>My ears caught no close noises. White Street lay empty.</p><p>I approached the door. A large paper seal was plastered across the door and part of the door frame with a big red DO NOT ENTER on it. Most police departments didn\u2019t have the budget for the infamous yellow crime scene tape. Ninety percent of the time, a sticker was the only indication of sealed premises. It wasn\u2019t meant to physically prevent anyone from entering the scene. It was meant to give the cops proof of your intent to enter despite the seal.</p><p>I pulled my lock pick ring out of my vest pocket, sliced the sticker with the thicker pick, and slid it and its thinner twin into the lock.</p><p>One, two, three...Click.</p><p>I edged the door open, slipped through, and locked it behind me. The moonlight spilled through the windows, giving more than enough illumination to examine the scene where I had almost died. The snake woman was gone and so were the snakes. The dark smears of Gloria\u2019s blood still painted the floor. Beyond them, the back door waited for me. I walked past the stains along the counter. The cops had probably swept the scene, but I didn\u2019t want to contaminate it if they hadn\u2019t yet.</p> <p>The back door had a serious look about it. I rapped my knuckles on the door. Steel. Large lock, with a few fresh-looking scratches across the metal. The PAD must\u2019ve gotten a locksmith to pop it open. I tried the door handle. It turned easily in my hand. The door swung open, revealing darkness. I stepped inside, shut the door behind me, and slid my hand along the wall, groping for the light switch. My eyes did fine with little light, but this was complete blackness. No moonlight meant no windows, so nobody would see me.</p><p>The air smelled of jasmine, that same dark, entrancing, menacing scent I\u2019d smelled before. My ears caught nothing. No sound troubled the silence except for my own breathing.</p><p>My fingers brushed the light switch. A row of recessed lights ignited in the ceiling. I stood in a long rectangular room. In front of me four rows of heavy-duty shelves stretched the length of the space, almost all the way to another door in the opposite wall. Odds and ends filled the shelves. A collection of beige stone spheres, ranging from the size of a grapefruit to as big as a basketball. A strange metal contraption with a tall metal rod in the center and two-feet-wide rings of metal threaded onto it. A dozen empty bottles, green, yellow, brown, and clear, were thrust through holes in rings, suspended upside down at an angle. A spear with a stylized metal flower for a guard. A lantern wrapped in chains. A fishing net hanging off a hook in the shelf. Clocks, a bust of a monkey carved from some dark wood, an ancient underwater helmet, a violin, an Egyptian cat next to brass scales, a Catholic priest\u2019s vestments with a purple stole...There was no rhyme or reason to it. No organization by type, no markings on the shelf.</p><p>A smorgasbord of junk, protected by an inch-thick metal door. That meant the junk was likely magic.</p><p>I squinted at the door in the opposite wall. A metal chain sealed it, locked with a heavy padlock. The PAD must\u2019ve run out of time or experts, because from where I stood, the padlock didn\u2019t look touched. I tiptoed through the gap between two shelves toward the back room.</p><p>The padlock featured a little black wheel. Combination-based. Great.</p><p>I grasped the chain and pulled. Little black dots swam in front of my eyes. My nose felt wet, as if I was bleeding.</p><p>The metal gave with a tortured screech, and the links of the chain snapped.</p> <p>I wiped my nose on my sleeve. No blood.</p><p>I pulled the chain out of the loops on the door and eased it open. A small office waited inside: a writing desk with a computer and a phone on it, shelves filled with files, and a tall glass cabinet. Inside the cabinet, a staff rested, caught between two metal hooks. It stood at least six and a half feet tall, its shaft of brown, aged wood polished to a smooth sheen. At about five feet high, the wood gave way to ivory that flared into a complex shape that seemed oddly familiar. A ferocious male face with a long mustache had been carved into the ivory, followed by rows of Cyrillic characters etched into the wood.</p><p>Cyrillic. I wondered how Roman was doing.</p><p>I moved to the desk and turned the computer on. It started with a quiet whirring. Code scrolled up on the screen, some sort of mathematical nonsense, and the log-in screen came on, requesting a password.</p><p>Let\u2019s see. \u201c123456.\u201d</p><p>The PC beeped and the log-in refreshed with a warning in red. Denied.</p><p>\u201c12345678\u201d?</p><p>Another beep.</p><p>\u201cPassword.\u201d</p><p>Beep.</p><p>Okay, fine. How about \u201cpassword1\u201d?</p><p>The screen blinked and Windows booted up.</p><p>Heh. One of the most common passwords, right up there with \u201cJesus,\u201d \u201cletmein,\u201d and \u201cIloveyou.\u201d I bet she\u2019d thought she was brilliant.</p><p>I pulled up the recent documents. Two clicks and I stared at the picture of the knife from the photograph in Anapa\u2019s study.</p><p>I leaned back. Something was vitally important about this knife. If Raphael was right and Gloria and Anapa were two independent players, that knife had to be truly something special. It looked so simple, time-worn, and almost brittle.</p><p>I sifted through the contents of the folder. PDF files. Yellowed clippings of news articles about Jamar\u2019s collection. An interview with the building\u2019s architect and next of kin after the Blue Heron fell. I hadn\u2019t seen that one before.</p><p>When asked for comment, Samuel Lewinston, who has authenticated most of the artifacts Jamar Groves had acquired, stated, \u201cIt\u2019s a great loss. The city lost one of its best sons and the people of Atlanta lost a collection that was a true treasure. The objects that were once our link to the past now lay buried with Jamar in his vault. Perhaps, one day history will repeat itself and they will be once again uncovered.\u201d</p><p>They were uncovered, alright.</p><p>Magic punched me, strong and sudden. The world blossomed in an explosion of sharper scents and brighter colors. The computer screen turned dark. I raised my head to the sky and swore. There were times I really hated magic. This was one of them.</p><p>A small silvery web flared on top of the ceiling directly above me. Uh-oh.</p><p>I jumped to my feet and moved away. Another web blossomed on the brick wall, expanding. A third bloomed to the right and above, yet another to the left and below...All around me glistening webs sprouted like wildflowers, stretching and growing. Within seconds the entire office was sheathed in a network of pearly slime, drawn in gossamer patterns across the walls and ceiling.</p><p>I moved toward the doorway and glanced through, into the main warehouse. Iridescent webs hung in layers from ceiling to floor, forming curtains over the shelves, the walls, and the other door.</p><p>The office was sealed tight and I was trapped in the middle of it.</p><p>Staying trapped here wasn\u2019t an option. Tomorrow the PAD would show up, and I would be arrested. They would be disinclined to take it easy. If I was arrested, I would be jailed and I\u2019d go away for a while, and Jim would have a hell of a time trying to pick up my investigation where I left off. Killers would go unpunished, justice wouldn\u2019t be served, and Nick would not get closure for the murder of his wife.</p><p>I needed to get the hell out of Dodge.</p><p>I took a pack of wooden pencils off the shelf and hefted it in my hand. If that stuff exploded, I\u2019d have to duck and cover.</p><p>I hurled the pencils into the web. For a second, the small package stuck to the slime, and then the web around it shivered and wrapped over it, twisting and winding, over and over, until the pencils disappeared from view and only a thick cocoon of slime remained. The rest of the pearly curtain flowed, replacing the web that had been used up by the cocoon.</p><p>If I tried to bust my way through the walls or run through the slime, I\u2019d be wrapped up like a mummy ready for burial faster than I could blink.</p><p>New plan. I pulled out my knife and worked a square of the parquet floor aside. Concrete. Great. Just great. That\u2019s the second time I had gotten trapped after breaking and entering. Maybe God was trying to tell me that I should give up my life of crime. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I dug in my duffel bag and pulled out the small flask of alcohol. The chair yielded a leg, the medkit gave me the gauze, and once I soaked it in alcohol, I had myself a torch. I set it on fire and carried the torch up to the wall. The flame licked the slime. The web bit at the torch, jerking it, and I let go a fraction of a second before the slime touched my fingers.</p><p>The torch stuck to the wall, cocooned in webbing. Fire didn\u2019t work. Fire pretty much always worked.</p><p>I looked around. Throwing something heavy at it wouldn\u2019t do either\u2014there was too much web and the walls were solid enough that I\u2019d have trouble breaking through.</p> <p>Think, think, think...</p><p>My gaze snagged on the staff.</p><p>I walked up to the desk and grabbed the phone. Phones were strange. Sometimes they worked during magic and sometimes they didn\u2019t. The phone clicked, once, twice, and I got a dial tone. I fished a card out of my wallet and dialed the number.</p><p>\u201cUllo,\u201d a familiar Russian voice said, dripping fatigue. \u201cYesli ehto ne catastropha...\u201d</p><p>Well, it looked like a catastrophe from my end. \u201cHi,\u201d I said. \u201cThis is Andrea.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, hello.\u201d A new life came into the voice. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m great. Never better. Hey, listen, I have a staff here I thought you might be interested in. It\u2019s about six and a half feet tall, part wood and part bone. There is writing on the shaft and a face with a mustache. Interested?\u201d</p><p>Roman fell silent for a second. When he came back on the line his voice was calm. \u201cCan you read the writing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome of it looks like runes and some of it is Cyrillic. Let\u2019s see, the top one under the face looks like backward number four, then e, then p, then something that looks like capital H except it\u2019s lower case...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you holding the staff now?\u201d Roman\u2019s voice was still very calm.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s in a case.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo not touch the staff. It\u2019s a very bad staff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in the back of a warehouse. I broke into it illegally, and I\u2019m now trapped by some strange ward. Looks like spiderwebs made out of slime. If you were to come and help me with the web, the staff is yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me the address.\u201d</p><p>I recited the address.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right there. Don\u2019t touch the staff. Don\u2019t touch the web. Don\u2019t touch anything until I get there.\u201d</p><p>I hung up. The dark scary servant of all evil was on his way to rescue me. Somehow that thought failed to make me warm and fuzzy.</p> <p>I had just finished going through the last box of documents, when the door across the warehouse opened, and Roman called out, \u201cAndrea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn here,\u201d I yelled. \u201cDon\u2019t touch the webs!\u201d</p><p>I got up and walked to the office doorway. The large warehouse space with the shelves stretched before me, shrouded in the curtains of the web. I could barely see him. From where I stood, he was merely a gray silhouette in the opposite doorway.</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay, I got this.\u201d The silhouette muttered something in Russian. A dull roar issued from Roman\u2019s direction.</p><p>Roman\u2019s voice rose, chanting, mixing with the roar.</p><p>The webs shuddered. The curtains bent toward Roman, turning concave, as if pulled backward.</p><p>Roman\u2019s chant gained power, preternaturally loud, words pouring out, whipping and twisting through the roar like a live current of power.</p><p>The curtain of webs snapped taut and broke. Roman stood in the gap, arms spread wide, his black robe flaring as if caught by a ghostly wind. He grasped a wooden staff topped with the head of a monster bird in his right hand. The bird\u2019s beak gaped wide open, filled with darkness and grotesque, so big a watermelon could have fit through it. The pearl-colored web twisted into a knot, sucked into that cavernous mouth.</p><p>The floor of the warehouse shuddered. Roman stared straight up, the chant bubbling from his mouth, each word vibrating with power. Splashes of pure darkness swirled around his black boots. Something peered at me through that darkness. Something ancient, malevolent, and cold.</p><p>The temperature in the room dropped. I shivered and watched a cloud of vapor escape my mouth.</p><p>A choir of deep male voices sang in tune to Roman\u2019s chant. The web kept hurtling into the staff\u2019s mouth.</p><p>My hands itched, wanting to release claws. Every hair on my body stood on end.</p><p>The warehouse shook.</p><p>An enormous bell tolled, a menacing bass note to the choir and the chant. Despair rolled over me like a thick viscous wave. Images fluttered before my eyes: a hill of corpses against the dusk, bright red blood painted over by feathery frost, and a primal dark figure atop the corpse mound...</p><p>Out of the corner of my eye, I saw the web on the wall flutter behind me, stretching toward Roman.</p><p>I dropped down and hugged the floor.</p><p>The web tore off the wall and flew over my head. For a second it stuck to the doorway of the office, billowing like a sail in a strong wind, and then it was pulled toward the staff.</p><p>The last of the web vanished into the dark beak. Roman\u2019s chant changed, receding from overpowering to soothing. The darkness melted, taking with it the somber choir and the bell. The top of Roman\u2019s staff closed its beak and shrank.</p><p>I sat up slowly.</p><p>Roman raised his arms, as if accepting an ovation, and grinned at me, flashing white teeth. \u201cHuh? Am I good or what?\u201d</p><p>I clapped. Roman bowed.</p><p>I got up off the floor and walked to the dark wizard.</p><p>\u201cDo I get a hug for being a hero?\u201d He wagged his black eyebrows at me. \u201cMaybe a kiss?\u201d</p><p>For being an evil priest of an evil dark god, Roman seemed surprisingly normal. Either he was hiding his evilness really well, or it really was just a job for him. Priest of darkness, nine to five. It\u2019s just the family business.</p><p>\u201cNo kiss?\u201d Roman looked sad.</p><p>Why not? It\u2019s not like Raphael owned me or we were together. It could be much simpler with someone like Roman. We could start fresh and clean. I looked at the dark wizard. Really looked at him. He had the most wicked eyes, dark and full of a strange fire. Here goes.</p><p>I leaned over and kissed him. His lips covered mine. He was good at kissing, not really claiming or demanding, but enticing, almost charming. And I felt nothing. Zip, zilch, nada. No heat, no spark. Nothing.</p><p>Stupid Raphael. I wished so badly I could be rid of him, but when he kissed me, I wanted to throw him on the bed and make him nuts. When Roman kissed me on the mouth, it felt like a peck on the cheek.</p><p>We broke apart. Roman grinned. Well, one of us had enjoyed it.</p><p>Roman\u2019s gaze fixed on something over my shoulder. I glanced back and saw the fishing net hanging off the hook.</p><p>\u201cThat can kill you,\u201d he said. \u201cYou better stand closer to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny closer and we\u2019ll be rubbing against each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow that\u2019s an idea...This can kill you, too.\u201d He pointed at the monkey bust. \u201cAlso that.\u201d The sandglass. \u201cAnd those\u201d\u2014 he pointed at the stone spheres\u2014\u201cthose can kill everyone if used properly. This is like an armory for a mage.\u201d</p><p>Roman pushed himself from the shelf, one arm protectively around my shoulder. \u201cI think I need to see that staff now.\u201d</p><p>I led him down to the office. \u201cIt\u2019s in a glass case here. I didn\u2019t touch it.\u201d I realized he wasn\u2019t next to me and turned. Roman stood in the doorway, his gaze fixed on the staff, his mouth slack.</p><p>\u201cKostyanoi posokh,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Bone Staff. Here, hold this!\u201d Roman thrust his stick at me.</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cNo. It bites things. I\u2019ve seen it do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe will behave,\u201d Roman promised.</p><p>I gripped the staff. It turned and stared at me with its vicious raptor eyes. Its beak opened a fraction of an inch. I bared my teeth and pantomimed breaking it. The beak snapped shut.</p><p>Roman dug in the pouch at his waist, pulled out a handful of moist black soil, and tossed it at the floor in front of the case. He knelt on the dirt, said something in Russian, and squeezed his eyes shut.</p><p>Nothing happened.</p><p>Roman cautiously opened one eye, then the other.</p><p>\u201cNo big kaboom,\u201d I assured him.</p><p>The black volhv rose. \u201cYou got any more of those gloves?\u201d</p><p>I pulled a pair out of my duffel and passed them to him. He slipped the gloves on, opened the case, and carefully took the staff out. The top of the staff flowed like molten wax forming an outline of a serpent mouth with two glistening fangs. The Bone Staff hissed. The bird staff in my hand screeched.</p><p>\u201cShhh,\u201d Roman murmured. \u201cTiho, tiho, easy.\u201d</p><p>The serpent melted back into the bone. A moment later the bird realized it was screaming by itself and shut its beak.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been looking for this for eight hundred years.\u201d Roman shook his head. \u201cHow did it even get here? When you described it, I thought it might have been a duplicate someone made to show off, but this? This is the real thing. I can feel the power through the gloves even.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo this is some sort of artifact?\u201d I asked. I felt so tired all of a sudden. I had to make sure not to get bitten again. The snake venom was turning me into an old decrepit woman.</p><p>\u201cThe Bone Staff belonged to the Black Volhv, the head priest of our god,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been missing for centuries, since the Mongols invaded Russia. Eventually the Horde came to the town of Kitezh on Lake Svetloyar. It was the last of the great pagan strongholds. But the magic was already weak, and the Mongols were too many, so the volhvi decided to work one last spell to keep the holy relics from the Horde. They sank the city.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, sank?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cBuried it in the lake. The whole thing. The Bone Staff was supposed to have been lost with the city, but then years later a respected old volhv, who was just a boy when Kitezh sank, claimed on his deathbed that the staff and other relics had been smuggled out of the city by him and two others before the place went under.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo this is a holy relic?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYep. The bones are supposed to belong to a Black Serpent Guhd. My dad will shit himself.\u201d</p><p>He was a walking encyclopedia of magic expertise. Just what I needed, except the picture of my knife was stuck in a nonfunctioning computer. I grabbed a piece of paper and a pen off the desk and sketched the knife one-handed, still holding on to the staff. \u201cDo you know anything about a knife? Looks somewhat like this?\u201d</p><p>Roman squinted at my drawing. \u201cIs that a walrus tusk?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d Obviously my drawing skills were lacking.</p><p>\u201cThen no. Not off the top of my head, no. Magic knives aren\u2019t exactly scarce.\u201d</p><p>Drat.</p><p>\u201cYou better let me have that.\u201d Roman reached for the bird staff and I let go. The volhv took it and grinned. \u201cTwo staves. It\u2019s like having two women.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes. Men.</p> <p>\u201cThank you for your help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. Are you done here? If not, I\u2019ll wait.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t find anything useful in the papers. The only thing that had any valuable information was the computer. I crouched down, disconnected the tower, and picked it up. \u201cI\u2019m done.\u201d</p><p>Outside, the night was pleasantly warm. We turned the corner and I pulled my hat off. Phew. The night breeze cooled my sweat-dampened hair.</p><p>Now I just had to get to the car. Get to the car and hopefully not pass out while I was driving. The exhaustion settled deep into my bones. It felt like I was dragging a cement block chained to my feet with every step and carrying another one in my arms. Look at the big bad shapeshifter. It was good that night had fallen and butterflies fluttered around. If one of them landed on me, it would score a perfect knockout.</p><p>Roman walked next to me, his stride brisk, looking fresh as a daisy. A very menacing black daisy.</p> <p>\u201cI can make it from here,\u201d I told him. I hope.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d he said, as if I offended him. \u201cI\u2019ll walk you to your car. Streets are not safe at night.\u201d</p><p>I shifted the tower in my arms. \u201cYou do realize I turn into a monster?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you turn into one, we\u2019ll talk. Right now you\u2019re not a monster. You\u2019re a lady. A very attractive one. And this is a bad neighborhood.\u201d</p><p>Heh. Ever the gentleman. \u201cSo if someone were to make trouble, would you turn him into a frog?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t do frogs. That\u2019s my mother\u2019s thing. The transmogrification never works completely. Changing the shape of something against its will requires a lot of energy, so you change someone into a frog and then it fails and he turns back into a human and comes after you with a gun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeaking from personal experience?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I\u2019ve seen it happen.\u201d</p> <p>We turned another corner. Roman cleared his throat. \u201cSo. You come here often?\u201d</p><p>I cracked up.</p><p>\u201cI like it when you laugh,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s hot.\u201d</p><p>Woo! \u201cThank you, Mr. Wizard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no, not a wizard.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cMagus maybe. I could live with that, but the proper term is volhv, really. We are priests.\u201d</p><p>I ducked through the gap in the ruin and stopped. My Jeep sat on four wooden blocks. Someone had taken my tires. They jacked my Jeep and stole my tires, the rims, and everything.</p><p>Screw you, Pucker Alley.</p><p>Roman shook his head. \u201cSomething tells me this is not a safe neighborhood.\u201d</p><p>I exhaled rage through my nose, like a pissed-off bull. It would take me thirty minutes to reach the office at a fast run on a good day. On a bad day like today, I\u2019d be walking for a couple of hours.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d Roman let out a shrill whistle.</p><p>A rapid staccato of hoofbeats approached from a distance. The night parted and an enormous horse trotted toward us. Massive, its coat slick and soft, like midnight sable, the horse approached, pounding the asphalt with every step. She stopped by Roman and nuzzled his shoulder, her long luxurious mane falling in a black wave down one side.</p><p>Wow.</p><p>Roman shifted his bird staff into the crook of his elbow and petted her nose. \u201cGood girl. See, we can ride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTogether on one horse?\u201d</p><p>He grinned.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a dirty volhv,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay, I\u2019ll walk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s your horse. Besides, I\u2019m a big girl. I can make it home on my own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cIf you walk away, I\u2019ll just follow you. I\u2019m going to see you home safe.\u201d</p><p>His jaw muscles were set, giving his face that telltale stubborn expression. Great. My dark volhv turned out to be a Southern gentleman. I had struck some sort of uniquely male chord in his soul. In his head, abandoning me alone on a night street clearly did not compute.</p><p>\u201cThere are some women who\u2019d be offended in my place,\u201d I told him. \u201cI\u2019m not helpless and I turn into a monster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019m afraid and I want company.\u201d He pretended to shiver. \u201cI may need a big strong monster to protect me. You wouldn\u2019t leave a defenseless attractive man out on the streets alone, would you?\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cOkay. You win.\u201d</p><p>Soon the two staves rested securely in a leather holder attached to the saddle and my tower was packed into a saddlebag. We walked, Roman with his hand on the horse\u2019s black leather reins embroidered with silver thread and I next to him, carrying a compound bow and a quiver of arrows I had gotten out of the car.</p><p>\u201cSo why the Chernobog?\u201d I asked. \u201cI\u2019m sure Russians have other gods, besides the deity of cold, evil, and death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the family trade. Our pantheon is all about balance. Where there is light, there must be darkness. Life is followed by death and the decay nourishes new life. Belobog, the white god, and Chernobog, they are brother gods, you see. My uncle is a white volhv, one of his sons will likely be a white volhv, too, and our side is the black volhvs. So that\u2019s why I\u2019m Chernobog\u2019s priest.\u201d He turned to me and grinned. \u201cAnd also for the chicks.\u201d</p><p>Ha! \u201cThe chicks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMhm.\u201d He nodded, completely serious. \u201cWomen like a man in black.\u201d</p><p>I laughed.</p><p>\u201cAdmit you were impressed,\u201d he said.</p><p>I kept laughing.</p><p>\u201cA little bit?\u201d He held up his index finger and his thumb about an inch away from each other. \u201cNot even a little bit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was impressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just you seem really funny and easygoing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do enough bad shit to keep ten city blocks awake at night wrapped up in nightmares. I don\u2019t need to maintain an image. At least not all the time.\u201d He glanced at me. \u201cI\u2019m really quite a nice fellow in my time off. I even cook.\u201d</p><p>The street ended. Below us a vast graveyard of broken buildings stretched, some little more than heaps of concrete dust, some still faintly recognizable as their former selves. The moonlight gleamed on a million shards of glass. Wooden bridges spanned the wreckage. To the left, behind the empty shells of the buildings, turquoise and orange fog rose, like a faint aurora borealis that had fallen from the sky. Unicorn Lane, the place where magic raged and bucked like an infuriated wild horse. We would be keeping clear. Only fools visited the Unicorn when the magic was up.</p><p>We started on the long bridge.</p><p>\u201cSo what about you?\u201d Roman asked. \u201cYou seem different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were all clenched up before.\u201d He drew his hand over his face, turning his expression somber. \u201cVery serious. Robot Andrea.\u201d</p><p>Robot, huh? I showed him the edge of my teeth. \u201cYou liked me anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, how can you not like this?\u201d He indicated me with his hands. \u201cI\u2019m only a man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are shameless.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cBut no, seriously. Something happened? Or is it just because Katya was there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKatya?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKate. Your friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. No, it\u2019s not her.\u201d I shrugged. \u201cI spent a long time locking up a part of myself. I thought it was best that I suppress my animal side. You know, the bad part.\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cBut it wasn\u2019t bad. Turned out I had been smothering something essential inside myself. Maimed it. I hobbled myself like a prisoner in leg irons and then heroically limped through life. When I think about all of the fun I could\u2019ve had, all the chances I could\u2019ve taken, it makes me a little sick. But now I\u2019m free. Maybe a little too free, but I\u2019m enjoying it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnjoying is good,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou understand about letting go, don\u2019t you?\u201d I asked. He probably didn\u2019t get to let himself off the chain that often either.</p><p>His face turned grim. \u201cI let go, lives end. People like me have many names. Volhv, kudesnik, which means \u2018magician,\u2019 charodei, which means \u2018enchanter,\u2019 but the most common term in history was mudrets. A wise man. People say that wisdom is bought with experience, which is just a polite way of saying that you\u2019ll fuck up a lot, people will get hurt, and your guilt will gnaw on you in your dreams. Well, I\u2019ve earned my wisdom, every drop of it. Let\u2019s talk of something else. Let\u2019s talk of how when we get to your office, you will offer me a cup of tea. You drink tea, right?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. Maybe I would offer him a cup of tea. Why not?</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of tea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEarl Grey, if I can get it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou put sugar in it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He stopped, a shocked expression on his face. \u201cNo sugar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to have sugar. And lemon.\u201d</p><p>The night breeze swirled about me and I caught a weak hint of jasmine, followed by the exact same layered scent I\u2019d smelled in Gloria\u2019s office. I notched an arrow and spun, scanning the ruins.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re about to get jumped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy whom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVenomous people with snake fangs in their heads.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The ruins lay deserted, no movement. A least half a mile separated us from the street and another mile or two of the bridge remained.</p><p>Roman pulled the bird staff out of its leather holder. \u201cWhere are they coming from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow many?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Behind us, something clanked against the wood. I whirled. A woman climbed over the edge and rolled onto the bridge coming to a crouch, holding a tactical combat blade. A man pulled himself up behind her.</p><p>No physical strain. No fighting, no running...Well, I was screwed.</p><p>A dry pop, like glass cracking, punched my eardrums. A cloud of black smoke exploded on the other side of the bridge, cutting us off.</p> <p>\u201cTeleportation, huh. Okay. I got this,\u201d Roman muttered and dug in the pouches on his belt.</p><p>The woman hissed at me, baring fangs.</p><p>Okay. Enough of that.</p><p>I fired. The bowstring twanged and the arrow sprouted from the woman\u2019s left eye.</p><p>The man charged at me.</p><p>Arrow, sight, draw, fire, all in the space of a second.</p> <p>The second shaft sliced through the man\u2019s throat, ripping a satisfying scream. He faltered, stumbled, and pitched over the side.</p><p>The black smoke coalesced into a bald man. He wore a strange pleated robe of brick-red fabric and an odd-looking apron. He held a short staff in his hand. Several small clay spheres hung from the staff, suspended by a string like a bunch of grapes. Another wizard. Great.</p><p>Roman yanked a pouch off his belt and hurled reddish powder into the air. The tiny dust granules hung, unmoving, shook, turning black, and sprouted wings. A swarm of black flies streamed toward the man.</p><p>More people scrambled onto the bridge.</p><p>Arrow\u2014fire. Arrow\u2014fire.</p><p>Two fell but they kept coming.</p><p>Fire, fire, fire.</p><p>The man howled a single word. Magic slapped me, nearly ripping the bow from my fingers. The flies rained down in a cloud of ash.</p> <p>The man waved his staff around, tore a small pot off of it, and hurled it at the ground. The bridge shivered and white scorpions skittered over the boards, heading for us.</p><p>I sent another man flying off the bridge with my arrow in his chest. Two more crawled up to take his place. Were they cloning these guys under the bridge?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like that, then? Okay.\u201d Roman barked out something vicious and drew a line with his staff, and spat. The scorpions reached the line and melted into boiling goo.</p><p>The man let loose a string of unfamiliar syllables and pulled out a strange-looking knife. The moonlight gleamed off the roughly hewn blade and the man sliced himself across his chest. Blood poured. He ripped the entire bunch of spheres off his staff and smashed them on the ground.</p><p>Dark wavy lines formed upon the bridge boards and coalesced into snakes. Hundreds of snakes.</p><p>Not again.</p><p>\u201cI can command snakes, too,\u201d Roman yelled. \u201cThis won\u2019t help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see!\u201d the man yelled back.</p><p>The snakes slithered to us.</p><p>\u201cImenem Chernoboga!\u201d Roman thrust his staff into the boards and planted his legs, gripping the staff directly in front of him with both hands. The bridge quaked. The staff opened its beak and screeched. Wind spun around Roman, stirring his robe. The snakes halted, unsure.</p><p>The other wizard shook his staff. The snakes attempted their best to slither forward, but hit an invisible wall of Roman\u2019s magic.</p><p>The black volhv clenched his teeth. The muscles of his face shook from the strain. Sweat broke out at his hairline.</p><p>The snakes reversed their course but made it only a few feet before slamming into the other wizard\u2019s magic. The reptiles began piling onto each other. Heads reared, and the snakes bit each other in a frenzy.</p><p>I had five arrows left.</p><p>Four.</p><p>The swarm built on itself. The injured snakes split in half, growing extra heads and tails and multiplying with shocking speed.</p><p>Roman shoved the three-foot-tall knot of snakes back at the other wizard.</p><p>The wizard ripped the wound on his chest and flung his blood at the swarm, pushing it back.</p><p>Two arrows.</p><p>\u201cYou will not pass!\u201d Roman thundered.</p><p>Great. Now he had decided he was Gandalf.</p><p>The five-foot snake swarm teetered toward the wizard. They just kept shoving the snakes back and forth with their magic, and meanwhile the swarm was growing bigger and bigger. It was a tower now, a boiling, slithering tower of reptile flesh.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll eat your guts!\u201d the wizard yelled. The snake tower careened back toward Roman.</p><p>Last arrow. I had to make it count.</p><p>\u201cIf I tell you that yours is bigger, will you kill him?\u201d I snarled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying,\u201d Roman squeezed the words out through clenched teeth. Blood poured from his nose.</p><p>I spun to the heap of dripping snakes, ran to the side of the bridge, and leaped onto the wooden rail, balancing on my toes. The snake tower rocked this way and that and through the gap I glimpsed the wizard\u2019s strained face.</p><p>I fired.</p><p>The arrow punched through the left half of his chest. He gasped, clamping his fingers to the arrow\u2019s shaft.</p><p>Roman groaned and the snake tower spilled over, burying the wizard.</p><p>I turned around. There were seven people on the bridge and they had stopped advancing, gaping at the writhing knot of reptilian bodies.</p><p>The knot showed no signs of getting smaller. In fact it was growing bigger, expanding like a snake tornado.</p><p>\u201cUh-oh,\u201d Roman said.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018Uh-oh\u2019?\u201d</p><p>He glanced at me. \u201cRun!\u201d And then he turned and sprinted down the length of the bridge, leading his horse by the reins.</p><p>It\u2019s never a good thing when the black volhv says \u201cUh-oh\u201d and then runs for his life. I dashed after him, ignoring the black specks fluttering before my eyes and the pain returning to my muscles.</p><p>We ran past our attackers. A moment later, they saw the writing on the wall and followed us. We pounded down the bridge. Behind me something roared. I didn\u2019t look back.</p><p>The air turned to fire in my lungs. My stomach lurched. Nausea came, followed by vertigo.</p><p>We cleared the bridge. Roman dropped to one knee, breathing like there was an anvil on his chest. I turned around.</p><p>A thirty-foot tower of snakes rose behind us. It swayed, rocking back and forth, dripping wriggling snake bodies, and exploded. Reptiles rained onto the ruins, revealing a single creature. Its long serpentine body was coiled into a tight spring. Brilliant gold and amber feathers flanked its triangular snake head. I had seen winged snakes before. They were tiny. Three feet was considered to be a large specimen.</p><p>The serpent raised its fanged maw to the skies. Scarlet wings snapped open along its chest. It sprung up, uncoiling its ten-foot-long body, and took to the sky.</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s not good,\u201d a woman said behind me.</p><p>\u201cDid Martinez turn into this, or did they eat him?\u201d a man asked.</p><p>\u201cHow am I supposed to know? He was the priest.\u201d</p><p>I spun around. The nine of us looked at each other. Roman pushed off the ground.</p><p>No arrows, I felt half-dead, and my volhv was all used up. There was only one thing I could do.</p><p>A large, blond woman jerked her sword up and charged me. I met her halfway, changing shape as I moved. My claws sliced into her stomach, cutting through the fragile muscle. Her slippery entrails slid against my fingers. I grasped a handful of intestines, ripped the sodden mass out, and flung it at the rest of her crew. A blood-curdling hyena cackle broke free from my fanged, black-lipped mouth. I charged.</p><p>A man stepped in my way. His blade cut my side, but I didn\u2019t care. I gripped his right arm, wrenched it out of the socket, and tore it off.</p><p>The mist of blood lingered in the area like an exotic, entrancing perfume. I danced through it, drunk, but crystal clear, maiming, killing, carving the pliant flesh into hot, juicy morsels. They fell before me and I loved it. Rage sang through my veins, fuel to my internal inferno. Inside me a distant small voice squeaked a warning\u2014I was using up the last of my fragile reserves\u2014but it felt so good and I didn\u2019t want to stop.</p><p>Another man stepped in front of me. I backhanded him out of the way. He flew and fell. Fun! I chased him and pinned him to the ground. My teeth snapped a hair from his throat. Hello, prey!</p><p>A familiar scent zinged through my nose. I knew this scent. I puzzled over it, holding the man down.</p><p>A name floated up to the surface of my memory: Roman.</p><p>Reality slammed into me, sudden and hard. I pulled myself back from the brink. My mind registered the strained expression on Roman\u2019s face and my claws puncturing his shoulders.</p><p>Oh God.</p><p>I rocked back, releasing him, slipped on something slick, and slumped against a ruined building. The street was filled with bodies. Blood pooled in the recesses of the uneven pavement, its scent like the cut of a razor on my tongue. A thing that used to be a woman lay only a few feet away. Half of her stomach was missing and her skull was a mess of crushed bone. I had done that.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d I asked softly. My voice was hoarse.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Roman slowly rolled up. \u201cWhat the fuck was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBouda rage. It happens sometimes when we\u2019re at our limit. We get a few minutes of berserker rage.\u201d It was the last-ditch defensive mechanism of a body out of options. \u201cI was bitten by a viper earlier. The Pack medmage pumped me full of antivenom. It made me weak, so when I turned, my body reacted. I didn\u2019t mean to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>Roman brushed his robe and got up. \u201cNo worries. Black doesn\u2019t show blood at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d He had no idea how close I had come to killing him.</p><p>\u201cNo worries. Look.\u201d He raised his arms, indicating the scene with the dismembered bodies, blood, and his black horse at the beginning of the bridge. \u201cAll our enemies are dead, we survived, the horse survived, the staff survived. I even get to say the best line from my favorite book. All is well.\u201d</p><p>I pushed away from the building. Roman opened his mouth to say something and didn\u2019t close it.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBreasts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh for the love of God!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Roman squeezed his eyes shut and turned away from me. \u201cI have a cloak in my bag.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m comfortable with my body the way it is,\u201d I growled.</p><p>He turned toward me a little and opened one eye, then turned and looked at me. Or rather at my chest.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stare.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou said you were comfortable.\u201d</p><p>Comfortable was one thing. Being on the receiving end of a very male stare was another.</p><p>\u201cHow about we find some gauze and bandage your shoulders,\u201d I suggested.</p><p>\u201cIt really isn\u2019t that bad.\u201d</p><p>We walked toward the horse.</p> <p>\u201cWhat were you doing in front of me anyway?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cYou had that dark-haired bitch by the throat and kept beating her head against the wall for almost three minutes,\u201d he said. \u201cI became concerned...\u201d</p><p>A red and gold silhouette plummeted from the sky. It dived at the horse, bit the Bone Staff, ripping it from the leather, and shot up to the clouds.</p><p>Holy shit.</p><p>Roman fell to his knees. He opened his mouth and let out a wordless scream of pure rage. \u201cAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will be okay,\u201d I told him.</p> <p>\u201cI had it! It was in my hands!\u201d He showed me his hands, as if expecting the staff to materialize in his fingers. \u201cIn my hands! Eight hundred years!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I told him. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>He slumped forward. \u201cI had it and I lost it. I lost it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d I told him. \u201cLet\u2019s get ourselves home before we both pass out.\u201d</p><p>We climbed the stairs to my apartment. I had collapsed on the street, my body finally giving out, and we had ended up riding Roman\u2019s horse after all. Roman moved like a zombie. Despondent didn\u2019t even begin to describe him. If despair was liquid, he\u2019d be dripping buckets of it with every step.</p><p>\u201cI had it in my hands,\u201d he told me mournfully, halfway up the stairs.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure I have some honey in my pantry,\u201d I told him. \u201cAnd lemon juice. We can have a nice cup of hot tea.\u201d</p><p>The landing smelled like fresh banana bread. Mrs. Haffey had been baking again. I slid the key into the lock and swung the door open.</p> <p>A pair of familiar black boots sat in the shoe rack in my foyer, between my black pumps and my yellow work boots.</p><p>You\u2019ve got to be kidding me. He didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cSomething wrong?\u201d Roman asked.</p><p>On the right, a row of hooks was attached to the wall\u2014I usually hung my rain-dampened jackets there to dry out before taking them to the closet. A large black leather jacket hung on the middle hook.</p><p>I marched into my apartment. What must be a spare set of Raphael\u2019s keys was in the round plastic dish where I normally left mine. In the kitchen a hanging pot rack had been installed over my dining room table. Raphael\u2019s copper-bottomed pots hung from it, and in the corner, his wine cabinet sat next to my spice shelves.</p><p>I dashed out of the kitchen, almost knocking Roman over. In the living room three prized swords from Raphael\u2019s collection hung on the walls. A picture of Aunt B in a dark frame was on the bookshelf next to the picture of my mother. Raphael\u2019s beige and brown Jaipur rug covered the floor. He had double-stacked my DVDs in the media case and added his own, all pre-Shift movies he loved: the entire Rocky collection, the Godfather I and II, Commando, Tropic Thunder...</p><p>I tore into the spare bedroom. I had used it for weapon storage. A new desk sat by the window with a computer on it and a tall filing cabinet next to it. He\u2019d made himself an office! In my spare room! A picture of Raphael and I sat on the desk next to the keyboard. He had his arms around me. I was smiling.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a boyfriend?\u201d Roman asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I snarled.</p><p>\u201cA male roommate?\u201d</p><p>I shoved the door to my bedroom open. A second night table stood on the other side of my bed, the perfect match to the one I had. With the same lamp. And his spy novels in a stack on top. I yanked open the closet door. Raphael\u2019s clothes hung on the left side, with his shoes in a row. I pulled open the dresser. His underwear. Condoms. His socks.</p><p>He had moved into my apartment. He\u2019d snuck in and made it look like he\u2019d lived here for the last ten years. His scent was everywhere, floating through my territory.</p><p>Words failed me. I just stood in the middle of my place, shaking with rage.</p><p>Breaking and entering was an essential part of the shapeshifter courtship. The idea was to break into your prospective mate\u2019s territory and get out undetected, proving that you were sleek enough to mate. Some clans left gifts. Boudas played practical jokes. But this? This was going too far.</p><p>He\u2019d punked me. Did he expect that after everything that had happened I would think this was charming? Did he think challenging me was funny? I would rip his head off.</p><p>\u201cI think you have a boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>I inhaled and exhaled slowly. \u201cNo, I just know somebody with a really sick sense of humor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Because there is a picture of you and him back in the office.\u201d Roman pointed his thumb back over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s an ex-boyfriend. He is having trouble understanding the word \u2018over.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what, he just moved his stuff in while you were gone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I ground out.</p><p>\u201cBallsy.\u201d</p><p>No, that wasn\u2019t ballsy. That wasn\u2019t even in the mile radius of ballsy. It was in its own little universe with the word \u201clunatic\u201d stamped on it. He should be locked in a padded room and never let out.</p><p>\u201cShould I leave?\u201d Roman asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. I promised you a cup of tea; we will drink that tea, God damn it.\u201d</p><p>I made a pot of tea in the kitchen. We sat at my kitchen table with MINE scratched on it and drank one cup each, before Roman couldn\u2019t stand it any longer and bailed.</p><p>The second he was out the door, I grabbed my phone and dialed Raphael\u2019s number.</p><p>\u201cHey, babycakes,\u201d he said into the phone.</p><p>Babycakes? Babycakes! \u201cYou want to act psycho? You haven\u2019t seen psycho yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not worried,\u201d he said. \u201cTo go psycho, you\u2019d have to pull that stick out of your ass and we both know that won\u2019t be happening.\u201d</p><p>I unclenched my teeth. \u201cYou will regret this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove you, babe.\u201d</p><p>The plastic receiver crunched in my hand and the phone went dead. I looked at it. Crushed electronic guts peeked out through the gaps in the broken plastic. I dropped the mangled wreck of the phone on my table and went into the bathroom.</p><p>A razor and shaving cream rested on the sink next to my lotion. A second toothbrush greeted me, a twin to mine, except mine was green and this one was blue. He had invaded my territory. He had put his stuff into it. He, he, he...Aaaaargh! He\u2019d made my place smell like him!</p><p>I grabbed the toothbrush. I wanted to break it into tiny pieces and then feed it into the garbage disposal.</p><p>No. I wouldn\u2019t give him the satisfaction. I wouldn\u2019t gather all of his things into a large metal trash can, I wouldn\u2019t pour gasoline on it, and I wouldn\u2019t set it on fire. No, nothing so pedestrian.</p><p>This, this deserved a special retaliation.</p><p>I would have to think of something. Oh yes. He would regret this. He would wish he\u2019d gotten run over by a PAD tank instead.</p><p>CHAPTER 11</p><p>I woke up early and lay in bed for a few minutes, looking at the ceiling, before my brain finally registered that there was a new chandelier on it. I must not have noticed it last night, when I finally fell into bed, exhausted and enraged. A glossy silver disk of about eighteen inches in diameter was attached directly to the ceiling. Long wavy crystal leaves patterned with ribs of varying textures cascaded from it, suspended by chains hidden within crystal beads. Thin tendrils of crystal, like the curved shoots of a grape vine, hung between the leaves, translucent with light, and between them, on longer gleaming chains, textured crystal spheres, frosted with silver, clinked gently in the light breeze from the open windows. It was beautifully romantic, yet modern, a kind of chandelier a twenty-first-century mermaid might have in her underwater cave or an Ice Queen from an Andersen fairy tale might hang in her palace of ice.</p><p>It was exactly the kind of chandelier I would\u2019ve loved to have. Elegant, feminine, romantic, but without a trace of corny cuteness. And I wanted to rip it out of my ceiling. He made me so angry.</p><p>I pushed myself out of the bed. The fatigue still napped deep in my bones, but it was growing weaker. No nausea. No ache. My body must\u2019ve won the war with snake venom. Now if I could only win the war with myself.</p><p>The magic was down and I was deeply grateful for not having to resort to the kerosene cooker. I went into the office, confiscated Raphael\u2019s monitor, and hooked up Gloria\u2019s tower at my kitchen table. While the computer booted up, I made myself two pieces of Texas toast\u2014a slice of thick bread, buttered on both sides and fried a bit in the pan, and a small steak, barely seared on both sides. I needed the calories. I boiled some shockingly strong coffee in an ibrik, a little Turkish coffeepot Kate had given me as a gift, and sat down to my breakfast. Mmm, coffee, the breakfast of champions. Delicious and nutritious.</p><p>I was halfway through my first cup and knee-deep in Gloria\u2019s files, when someone knocked on my door. The peephole revealed a scowling black man in his early thirties, dressed in black and looking like he wanted to bite someone\u2019s head off. Jim. There were other people in the hallway behind him. What the hell?</p><p>I opened the door. Jim stood in my doorway. He was over six feet tall, with short hair, and the kind of muscular build that resulted when you fought for your life a lot. He looked like a thug, and he worked very hard to keep looking like that. Jim liked to be underestimated.</p><p>When I first came to Atlanta, I made it a point to read through the background files the Order kept on the shapeshifters. Before Jim\u2019s father went to prison and died there, shanked by an inmate, Jim was taking advanced classes and skipping grades. Jim could\u2019ve been anything he wanted. A doctor, like his father. A scientist. An engineer. But life got in his way. He was the alpha of Clan Cat now and he oversaw the entirety of the Pack\u2019s security, which meant every day he got to spy, discover, and eliminate threats to the Pack. Jim loved his job. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Behind him eight people crowded into the landing: Sandra and Lucrezia from Clan Bouda, both combat operatives; Russell and Amanda from Clan Wolf; two guys I didn\u2019t know; Derek, the third employee of Cutting Edge; and my lawyer, Barabas.</p><p>\u201cIf this is a lynch mob, you didn\u2019t bring enough people,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t answer your phone,\u201d Jim said. His voice was at odds with his face: his face said \u201cbone-breaker,\u201d but his voice said \u201cromantic ballad singer.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI crushed it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Barabas asked.</p><p>\u201cI was having relationship issues,\u201d I told him.</p><p>Derek grinned. He used to work with Jim before joining Cutting Edge. At nineteen, he had been almost arrestingly handsome, but then some monsters poured molten metal on his face. We had killed the fuckers, but Derek\u2019s face never healed quite right. He wasn\u2019t disfigured, but he was scarred, and he looked like the type of man you would not want to meet in a dark alley. I\u2019ve seen him walk into a bar and stop the chatter with his face alone.</p><p>Jim, Derek, Barabas, and two combat boudas, not counting the other guys. Either they expected me to put up a hell of a fight, or something heavy was about to happen.</p> <p>\u201cCan we come in?\u201d Jim asked.</p><p>And see Raphael\u2019s handiwork? Unfortunately, telling the Pack\u2019s chief of security to shove off would have been extremely unwise, not to mention counterproductive to my investigation. Great. The shapeshifters gossiped worse than bored church ladies. Before tonight the whole Pack would know about Raphael\u2019s stunt. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>I watched them file into my apartment. The two boudas nodded at me in passing. This was interesting.</p><p>The eight shapeshifters spread through my living room and kitchen and suddenly my apartment seemed too small.</p><p>\u201cI thought Raphael had moved out,\u201d Barabas said.</p><p>Remain calm. \u201cActually, we never lived together in my place. I lived at his,\u201d I said. I would not bite Barabas. It wouldn\u2019t be right.</p> <p>\u201cHe was back here last night while she was out,\u201d Jim said. \u201cHim, and a large moving truck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Barabas thought about it. His eyes lit up. \u201cOh!\u201d</p><p>Slapping my lawyer was not in my best interests either. I turned to Jim. \u201cYou put a detail on my apartment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe second you became a target,\u201d he said.</p><p>Well, that just took the cake. I tilted my head. \u201cSo good of you to let me know, cat. I\u2019d hate to mistake my babysitter for a threat and accidentally shoot him.\u201d</p><p>Jim blinked. Ha! I had managed to surprise the spy master.</p><p>\u201cSo these are new furnishings?\u201d Barabas said, his face pure innocence.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tempt me, Barabas.\u201d</p> <p>The two bouda women made big eyes at the portrait of Aunt B on my shelf.</p><p>\u201cLovely decorations,\u201d Sandra offered and bit her lip, obviously straining not to laugh.</p><p>\u201cYes, the way the light here plays on Aunt B\u2019s face is very nice,\u201d Lucrezia added.</p><p>\u201cFuck you, Lucrezia,\u201d I told her.</p><p>Sandra groaned and the laughter burst out of her mouth. She doubled over. Lucrezia dissolved into giggles.</p><p>By tonight, not just the Pack, but the shapeshifters in Canada would know what Raphael had done to my apartment. I would murder him.</p><p>I crossed my arms on my chest and turned to Jim. \u201cIs there a reason for all of you coming here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Jim said. \u201cWhy do you have your computer on the kitchen table?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is a long conversation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have time.\u201d</p><p>We sat down at the kitchen table and I briefed him on last night while Derek made more coffee for everyone. I explained Anapa in broad terms, the Bone Staff, the volhv, and the knife. At the end, Jim nodded at the computer. \u201cKyle, see what you can do with that?\u201d</p><p>A beefy guy who looked like he bent steel rods for a living sat down at the computer, opened a small briefcase, hooked up some box with blinking lights to the tower, and his fingers started flying over the keyboard. He winked at me, still typing without looking at the keyboard.</p><p>\u201cGloria has no fingerprints on file,\u201d Jim said. \u201cNo driver\u2019s license, no city permit for her shop, nothing. She just showed up one day and set up her trinket bazaar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd nobody cared because it was White Street?\u201d How did he know all this?</p><p>Jim nodded. \u201cHow can I make your life easier?\u201d</p><p>If we didn\u2019t have an audience, I might have hugged him. \u201cGloria and her friends likely murdered Raphael\u2019s people. First, I need to canvas White Street and the Warren and shake some information out. How often was she at the shop, who came to visit her, when did she leave, what did she drive, where she went, and so on. Basic legwork. Second, I need to establish Anapa\u2019s whereabouts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou still like him for this?\u201d Jim asked.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something weird about him. I have a gut feeling that he is up to his ass in this mess, but he probably wasn\u2019t working with Gloria. Third, I need a ritual knife expert. I left a message for Kate, so that should be taken care of if I can tear her away from Curran\u2019s side for five minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of it,\u201d Jim said. \u201cI\u2019ll check in with you as soon as we know something.\u201d</p><p>Someone knocked. This was my day for visitors apparently.</p><p>\u201cHold on,\u201d Jim said and nodded at the door.</p><p>Derek walked to my door. I heard it open and then Derek\u2019s voice said, \u201cCome in, Detectives.\u201d</p><p>Barabas hid behind the wall in the kitchen.</p><p>Collins and Tsoi entered my living room. Two uniformed officers followed and Derek brought up the rear. The cops stared at the shapeshifters. Jim and Company stared back.</p><p>\u201cWhat are all of you doing here?\u201d Collins finally asked.</p><p>\u201cI could ask you the same thing.\u201d Jim kept his voice calm.</p><p>\u201cWe need to speak to Nash,\u201d Tsoi said.</p><p>\u201cBy all means,\u201d Jim said. \u201cWe won\u2019t be in the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d rather do this down at the station,\u201d Collins said.</p><p>\u201cIs my client under arrest?\u201d Barabas said, stepping out in plain view.</p><p>Collins grimaced. Tsoi rolled her eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to jump out like a jack-in-the-box,\u201d Collins said.</p><p>\u201cBut I know how much the two of you love surprises. I\u2019d like to see the warrant, please,\u201d Barabas said.</p><p>Collins locked the muscles on his jaw.</p><p>\u201cNo warrant?\u201d Barabas smiled.</p><p>Tsoi was looking around the room, doing the math. Ten shapeshifters vs. four cops. Suddenly everyone\u2019s face turned grim.</p><p>\u201cAll this would go away if you cooperated,\u201d Collins said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re willing to cooperate, if we get full disclosure on the antique dealer case with access to evidence,\u201d Jim said.</p><p>\u201cNot happening,\u201d Tsoi said.</p><p>\u201cYour call.\u201d Jim shrugged.</p><p>Collins turned and walked out.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t over,\u201d Tsoi said and left, the two uniforms in tow.</p><p>Nobody said anything until Sandra at the window announced, \u201cThey are getting into their cars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you,\u201d Jim said to Barabas. \u201cI know Collins, he\u2019s a reasonable man.\u201d</p><p>Barabas sighed. \u201cBut I was looking forward to a fight.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly things made sense: somehow Jim had discovered the cops were coming to pick me up, and he\u2019d brought his posse over to keep them from taking me off.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know they were coming?\u201d I asked Jim.</p><p>\u201cI have my ways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bugged the PAD station.\u201d Sonovabitch. If he got caught, there would be hell to pay.</p><p>Jim smiled without showing his teeth. \u201cSomething like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are under heavy-duty pressure from above to solve the case,\u201d Barabas said. \u201cPeople with snake fangs made somebody in the mayor\u2019s office really nervous. Almost makes me wonder if they know something that we don\u2019t and they want to put a lid on this whole thing as fast as they can. The plan was to pick you up and sweat you a little for information. We can\u2019t let them do that\u2014you have things to do and there is no reason you should be wasting time in their interrogation room. Since your phone was out, we decided to show up before they did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe take care of our own,\u201d Lucrezia said.</p><p>But I wasn\u2019t their own. Well, not officially. And yet they had come here to back me up. I looked from face to face and realized they would do it again and I would do the same. In their heads, I already belonged.</p><p>Wow.</p><p>For once in my life I didn\u2019t have to hide who I was. They had my back and that was that.</p><p>Half an hour later everyone filed out of my apartment. Kyle took the computer with him. On the way out, Sandra stopped by me. \u201cAunt B wants a word. Today at ten at Highland Bakery. She said not to be late.\u201d</p><p>The gentle paw of the Bouda alpha. \u201cI\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p><p>Jim was the last to exit. He paused at the door. \u201cI\u2019ve got the legwork. My people will do the background and they\u2019ll dig up whatever dirt Anapa has.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAha.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know Collins. He is competent and thorough. When you leave your apartment, you\u2019ll have a tail. I need you to do nothing for twenty-four hours or so. You know how the game is played: you\u2019re the lightning rod. Lead them around, don\u2019t lose them, go have lunch with Aunt B, visit a market or something. Be anywhere but near Anapa or White Street. Let the cops concentrate on you, so my people can work in peace. You can use a day off anyway. You look like hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll spend your life a bachelor, Jim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay away from White Street.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, I got it.\u201d</p><p>I hustled him out the door and locked it. I had phone calls to make.</p><p>At eleven o\u2019clock I walked through the door of Highland Bakery wearing black pants, a black shirt, my steel-toed combat boots, and crimson lipstick. It matched the new me much better. My clandestine police escort conveniently parked right across the street. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Located on Highland Avenue, the low brick building that housed Highland Bakery had survived magic\u2019s jaws mostly intact. This area was called the Old Fourth Ward. Before the magic took Atlanta apart, the Fourth Ward was a happening place with historic buildings from the beginning of the previous century, defunct factories converted to loft apartments, and renovated shotgun shacks\u2014long, narrow, rectangular structures, once reminders of poverty transformed into trendy housing. Supposedly the name came from the structure of the house: if you fired a shotgun through the front door, the pellets would fly through the whole house and out the back door.</p><p>The Old Fourth Ward was home to the Boulevard\u2014a place where more drugs passed hands than in most other areas of the city combined\u2014and Edgewood Avenue\u2014where dozens of bars and restaurants had offered drinks, music, and other pleasures of the nocturnal variety.</p><p>Now with Downtown in ruins to the west and Midtown equally ravaged, the Old Fourth Ward had quieted down. The bars and restaurants were still there, but they catered to working-class patrons. It was a place where carpenters, masons, and city employees came for lunch, and Highland Bakery was the place where they stopped on the way home when a craving for sweets struck them.</p> <p>I had checked the outdoor area, but Aunt B wasn\u2019t at any of the black wrought-iron tables, so I went inside, past the counter filled with confections of chocolate, berry, and cream, through the narrow room with a bench to the back. The restaurant was near empty\u2014lunch was a good hour away. Aunt B sat in the corner, with her back to the wall. She looked to be in her early fifties, slightly plump, with a kind face and chestnut hair she put up in a bun. She wore a nice green blouse and khaki capris and looked just like a grandmother about to serve you some cookies.</p><p>Looks were deceiving. Most people were terrified of Aunt B. Hell, I was terrified of Aunt B. Even other alphas steered clear, including my best friend, the Beast Lord\u2019s Consort. Whenever Aunt B was mentioned, Kate got this odd look on her face. Not alarm exactly, but definite concern.</p><p>On her right sat Lika, her beta. Tall, well built, Lika had short dark hair and a harsh face, the kind you would expect from a female soldier who spent too much time on active duty. Clan Bouda had a few women who were older, more experienced, and could take Lika out, but none of them wanted the hassle of the beta job. Betas had busy lives and a lot of responsibility. Alphas made decisions, betas saw them implemented.</p><p>Here was my chance. I would join Clan Bouda, just like everyone wanted. But I would do it on my terms.</p><p>I paused before the table and stared at Lika. \u201cYou\u2019re in my seat.\u201d</p> <p>Aunt B\u2019s face remained perfectly placid.</p><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d Lika\u2019s eyebrows came together.</p><p>\u201cMove,\u201d I told her.</p><p>\u201cMove me,\u201d she said.</p><p>I looked at Aunt B. Normally public challenges were to the death, but there were only three of us here.</p><p>\u201cTo submission,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to lose either of you. There aren\u2019t many of us.\u201d</p> <p>Lika got up from behind the table. She had about six inches on me and maybe forty pounds, all of it lean, hard muscle. But she had never seen me fight, while I knew her moves.</p><p>I pushed the nearest table back, clearing some space. Lika did the same.</p><p>Lika rolled her head to the left, cracking her neck, then again to the right. I rolled my eyes and pretended to look bored.</p><p>She lunged. It was a fast, deadly lunge. Her right fist snapped out like a hammer.</p><p>I ducked low under the lunge, smashed my shoulder under her rib cage, grabbed her legs a couple of inches under her butt, and heaved. My lunge had knocked her off her center of gravity and she had nowhere to go but up. I flipped her in the air and drove her down with all my strength, crouching to control her fall. Lika\u2019s back hit the floor\u2014boom! Before she had a chance to catch her breath, I drew a line with my fingers across her throat and stepped back.</p><p>Lika took two seconds to shrug off the daze and rolled to her feet. \u201cAgain?\u201d</p><p>I looked at Aunt B, like a good little bouda. I knew about the chain of command. In fact, the chain of command made me feel secure and comfy.</p><p>Aunt B nodded.</p> <p>Lika shifted her stance and rocked back and forth on her toes. Okay. I tensed, as if to advance. She took a step with her left foot and kicked out with her right in a roundhouse, aiming for my ribs with her shin. It was a hell of a kick. Had I stayed still, it would\u2019ve shattered my ribs, crippling me. Can\u2019t do much with shattered ribs, except bend over to one side and moan.</p><p>I caught her leg just under the knee, wrapping it with my left arm, took a step forward, pushing Lika back and off balance, and swept her other leg from under her. She went down hard. I crouched long enough to pretend-slice her side\u2014marking her internal organs as my target. If I had claws, I could\u2019ve shoved my hand into her, under and into the rib cage, and ripped her heart out. I took a few steps back.</p><p>Lika rolled to her feet. Her lip trembled in the beginnings of a snarl.</p><p>\u201cNo fur,\u201d Aunt B said. \u201cLadies, in a public place, we wear our public face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgain?\u201d I asked and looked at Aunt B.</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>Lika charged. Her hands closed over my arms. A grappling move. She was banking on her superior strength. But no amount of strength could change simple physics.</p><p>I clamped my hands on her forearms, planted my left foot in the middle of her stomach, and rolled back. She didn\u2019t expect it and the momentum pulled her down. I rocked forward, slamming my ankle onto her throat and forcing her back, and rolled up into a sitting position with both legs across Lika\u2019s chest and her arm clenched to me. Before she had a chance to get her bearings, I leaned back, stretching her arm across my body. With my thighs as an anchor, all I had to do was pull a little and her elbow would be toast.</p><p>\u201cDislocate,\u201d Aunt B said.</p><p>I pulled the elbow. The joint popped with a dry crunch.</p><p>Lika growled through her clenched teeth.</p><p>\u201cThere will be no rematch,\u201d Aunt B said. \u201cShe has better technique and more education. She\u2019s also faster than you are. Are we clear, dear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d Lika squeezed out.</p><p>\u201cLet her go.\u201d</p><p>I released Lika\u2019s arm, rose, and offered her my hand. The bouda looked at it for a second, sighed, and gripped my fingers with her uninjured hand. I pulled her up. \u201cGood fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d Her voice didn\u2019t hold any real hostility. \u201cI was tired of being a beta anyway. You can have all the hassle.\u201d</p><p>Lika looked at her limp arm. \u201cI\u2019m going to the bathroom to fix this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be too long,\u201d Aunt B said. \u201cI\u2019m ordering your favorite red velvet cupcakes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Alpha.\u201d Lika walked away toward the bathroom.</p><p>Aunt B turned to me and smiled. I could\u2019ve sworn there was pride in it. It couldn\u2019t be. I was deluding myself.</p><p>\u201cSit down, dear,\u201d Aunt B said. \u201cLove the lipstick, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d I took Lika\u2019s spot and waited until the bathroom door closed behind her. \u201cWhy hurt her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you gave her half a chance, we would be here till sundown.\u201d Aunt B shrugged. \u201cLika is stubborn. Nothing short of a decisive victory would stop her. Remember that. You\u2019ll deal with her as my beta and she does prove troublesome on occasion.\u201d</p><p>Aunt B looked at me from across the table. Her irises flashed a bright, ruby red. The weight of the alpha stare pressed on me. I held it for a moment too long and forced myself to look down at the table. \u201cWelcome to the family,\u201d Aunt B said.</p><p>I was in. For better or worse, I was now a member of Clan Bouda and Aunt B\u2019s second.</p><p>A waitress came in with a tray of cupcakes, a pot of tea, and three cups.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t lived until you\u2019ve had their red velvet cupcakes.\u201d Aunt B pushed a plump cupcake toward me. \u201cHave one.\u201d</p><p>My new alpha was offering me food. Another show of loyalty and submission. Breaking elbows wasn\u2019t enough, apparently. I bit the cupcake and licked the creamy icing. Mmm, cream cheese. Fighting made me hungry.</p><p>The waitress departed.</p><p>\u201cYou do know what the beta job entails?\u201d Aunt B asked.</p><p>Of course. \u201cEnforcer, gatekeeper, errand girl, bouda nagger.\u201d</p><p>Aunt B cut a small cupcake in half and bit off a piece. \u201cYou forgot babysitter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. How silly of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy the sudden change of heart?\u201d B asked.</p><p>\u201cTwo things. First, Jim came to visit me this morning. He brought eight people with him. They occupied my apartment and when some cops showed up trying to take me in, they were met with firm resistance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I realized that if I was in trouble, the Pack would back me up and I would back up the Pack. All my friends are in the Pack. I like to belong. I need it, need the structure.\u201d I licked the icing. \u201cI\u2019m tired of starting over. I\u2019m not likely to stop being a shapeshifter, so I might as well make the best of it. I will be the best bouda I can be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter than me?\u201d B arched her eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cYep. I plan to eclipse your fame.\u201d</p><p>Aunt B smiled. \u201cAiming high.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d I sipped my tea.</p><p>\u201cAnd the second thing?\u201d Aunt B asked.</p><p>\u201cI spoke to Martina and realized that to take the clan away from you, I need to earn their loyalty first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, so you plan to take over?\u201d</p><p>I licked the icing off my lips. \u201cIn a few years. Once I am sure they will follow me.\u201d</p><p>Aunt B leaned back and laughed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve done such a good job for such a long time,\u201d I said. \u201cDon\u2019t you feel you deserve a nice retirement?\u201d</p><p>Aunt B kept laughing. \u201cVery well. I will speak to Curran. In light of the investigation, I\u2019m sure the lion will grant us an extension on having you officially admitted into the ranks. As long as it is known that you and I have an understanding and an application has been made, you won\u2019t encounter problems.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lika returned from the bathroom, rubbing her arm, plopped at the seat next to me and waited until B waved her toward the food. Lika snagged a red velvet cupcake. \u201cYummy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need you to go to Milton County,\u201d B said.</p><p>Uh-oh. The sheriff of Milton County and I didn\u2019t have the best relationship. He was the one who had locked us up after the hot tub incident.</p> <p>\u201cWhere to?\u201d I asked and sipped my tea. Earl Grey. Tasty.</p><p>\u201cTo the Milton County Sheriff\u2019s office,\u201d Aunt B said.</p><p>I choked a little on my tea.</p><p>\u201cSome of our people got arrested last night,\u201d Lika said. \u201cIncluding your boy.\u201d</p><p>My boy? Oh. \u201cWhat did Ascanio do this time? Last I saw him, he was with his mother.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Aunt B said. \u201cWrong place, wrong time. There was some sort of bar brawl. I could go to Kate with this, but you see, she is spending all her time with Curran. Something to do with the Vikings, not sure what exactly.\u201d Aunt B waved her spoon. \u201cInvolving her right now means involving the Beast Lord and I don\u2019t feel like setting his tail on fire. He\u2019ll growl and fuss and I\u2019d rather avoid all that. So I need you to go down there and make this problem go away. I understand you and Beau Clayton have a special relationship.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, he\u2019d thrown my bikini-clad butt into a jail cell. \u201cI can do that,\u201d I said and stole a second cupcake.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad,\u201d B told me.</p><p>We all drank some tea.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019ve spoken with my son,\u201d B said to me.</p><p>\u201cYes. He seems to have gone insane.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe mating frenzy will do that,\u201d Aunt B said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not talking about the blonde. He has never been dumped before, dear. He has no idea how to handle it.\u201d</p><p>Lika snickered.</p><p>\u201cI told him we were through, and he broke into my place, scratched MINE into my table,\u201d I told her. \u201cAnd then he moved his things into my apartment.\u201d</p><p>Lika stopped eating. \u201cSeriously?\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>Aunt B grinned. \u201cHe was always such a clever boy.\u201d</p><p>There it was, the final proof that Raphael could do no wrong. I had just told her he had gone nuts, vandalized my furniture, and was guilty of breaking and entering, and she was bursting at the seams with pride.</p><p>\u201cWhat would you do in my situation?\u201d I asked.</p> <p>Aunt B cut another slice off her cupcake. \u201cI was never one to let a man get the better of me, dear. If someone dared to treat me in this manner, I would rub his nose in everything he had lost by his idiotic stunt. I would do something...spectacular. Something he would never forget. And I would make sure everyone knew what a fool he was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I spring the boudas out of jail, what are the chances of Raphael spending this evening away from his house?\u201d</p><p>Aunt B smiled at me above the rim of her cup. \u201cI would say those chances are very, very good.\u201d</p><p>I got up. \u201cI\u2019d best get on with it, then.\u201d</p><p>Aunt B\u2019s eyes sparked with an amused ruby light. \u201cLika will fill you in on the details. Good luck, dear.\u201d</p><p>I would need every drop of it, too.</p><p>\u201cAnd Andrea?\u201d Aunt B said. \u201cYou and I have made a deal today. I trust you to hold up your end of the bargain.\u201d</p><p>It was like she had looked into my head and seen that inside I was still wobbling. I talked the talk and walked the walk, but somehow she had sensed my hesitation.</p><p>\u201cIf Curran sets the date for your admittance and you fail to show up, it would be truly disastrous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo worries,\u201d I told her. \u201cI\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p><p>To say that Beau Clayton was a good old Southern Boy would be an understatement. The man kept a can of green boiled peanuts on his desk, for crying out loud. For some reason, it was half-filled with bullet casings.</p><p>Beau looked at me from behind his desk, which was organized to within an inch of its life. He was big as all hell and half of Texas, a massive bear of a man, with lineman\u2019s shoulders and power-lifter\u2019s arms that strained the sleeves of his crisply-ironed khaki uniform shirt. His dark brown, wide-brimmed sheriff\u2019s hat rested on a hook on a wall, within easy reach. Above it a rapier hung, a beautiful sword with an ornate basket hilt. I was pretty sure I had seen it before, but for the life of me I couldn\u2019t recall where.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s always nice to see you, Ms. Nash,\u201d Beau drawled.</p><p>I gave him my most dazzling smile. If he thought he could out-Southern me, he was in for a shock. \u201cMay I ask why you have bullet casings in that can, Sheriff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery time someone shoots at me, I put the casings into the can,\u201d he said.</p><p>Alright then.</p><p>\u201cSo what brings you to the sunny skies of Milton county?\u201d Beau asked.</p><p>\u201cYou have some of the Pack\u2019s people in lockup.\u201d And my first test as a beta was to get them out.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re always glad to have guests in our jailhouse,\u201d he said. \u201cWe almost never get lonely.\u201d</p><p>I licked my lips, moistening them, and Beau\u2019s gaze slid down. Well, how about that? Hehehe.</p><p>\u201cI understand you have three of our boys,\u201d I said. \u201cHow would I go about getting them released?\u201d</p><p>Beau leaned against his chair. \u201cWell, this is where we run into a problem. From what I understand, your boys caused a disturbance at the Steel Horse, assaulted two men, and damaged some property there.\u201d</p><p>I crossed my legs. \u201cAs I recollect, the Steel Horse is in Fulton County.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou recollect correctly, but you see, your boys were out for a hell of a night. Not satisfied with that bit of fun in Fulton, they continued their brawl down Gawker Alley, which put them twenty feet inside Milton County when they were subsequently apprehended.\u201d</p><p>Drat.</p><p>Beau\u2019s eyes sparkled a bit. \u201cEyewitness accounts indicate a female was involved.\u201d</p><p>I smiled at him. \u201cA female is always involved. So how does your version go?\u201d</p><p>Beau clicked the recorder on his desk. A young man\u2019s voice filled the room. \u201cSo we were just sitting there and then there was a girl and she was looking at Chad and me.\u201d</p><p>Slurring his words a bit. Not quite sober. Not by a long shot.</p><p>\u201cAnd Chad said, \u2018Hey, pretty, come hang with us,\u2019 and the big black dude said, \u2018Shut your mouth, white boy.\u2019\u201d</p><p>I arched my eyebrows at Beau. The big black dude would be Kamal, who had never said a nasty word to anyone in his entire life.</p><p>\u201cAnd he said, \u2018Shut your mouth,\u2019 and I said, \u2018We just talking\u2019 and the other black guy said, \u2018We gonna beat your ass if you keep running your mouth.\u2019 And then he made one of those hand signs. You know, one of those gang things.\u201d</p><p>Oh, this was just getting better and better. Beau was making a valiant effort to remain stoic, but his face betrayed the long-suffering look of someone who had to listen to something patently idiotic.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened next?\u201d an older female voice asked.</p><p>\u201cWe got up to leave, and the girl wanted to come with us, and the first black guy, he, like, got up and he was all, \u2018You\u2019re not leaving!\u2019 and we were all like, \u2018Yes we are,\u2019 and then I threw some chicken at them so they\u2019d know we meant business, and the white kid who was with them, he picked up Chad and threw him through the window.\u201d</p><p>Drunk knights in shining armor, protecting the hapless female from the clutches of scary black guys. Give me a break.</p><p>\u201cThen what happened?\u201d the older female asked.</p><p>\u201cThen they left and went up the street. And Chad was like, \u2018We can\u2019t let them get away with this shit,\u2019 so we followed them. And I said, \u2018Hey! What do you think you\u2019re doing with that throwing people through windows and shit.\u2019 And the white guy said, \u2018You must like going through windows.\u2019 And I told him \u2018Fuck you\u2019 in a polite voice and he threw me through the window.\u201d</p><p>Beau clicked the recorder off.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good that he used his polite voice,\u201d I said. \u201cOtherwise no telling what would\u2019ve happened.\u201d</p><p>Beau grimaced. \u201cThey aren\u2019t the sharpest tools in the shed and booze didn\u2019t improve their IQ any.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what do the Big Scary Black Guys say?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cThey say that the kids were drunk and kept hitting on the girl who was with them. One of them wandered over, and threw some buffalo wings at them, and got thrown through the window. The girl took off and they decided to leave. The two geniuses followed them and got thrown through the front window of Chuck\u2019s Hardware.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTossing chicken at people constitutes an assault,\u201d I said. \u201cBy their own admission, they threw the first punch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the instance of the situation at the Steel Horse, correct. However, your people are not being held for the incident at the Steel Horse; they are being held because during a verbal altercation in Gawker Alley, they took it upon themselves to put two people through Chuck\u2019s window.\u201d</p><p>He had me there. \u201cWith all due respect, that\u2019s a continuation of the same incident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see why you might think that, but it took Mike and Chad ten minutes to stagger their drunken way up Gawker. It\u2019s two different incidents and you know it.\u201d</p><p>Argh. \u201cI beg to differ.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI respect your right to differ, but that doesn\u2019t change reality. I cannot have people thrown through windows willy-nilly in my county.\u201d</p><p>We stared at each other. The level of politeness had risen to dangerous levels.</p><p>\u201cWe would be delighted to pay restitution to Chuck\u2019s Hardware and to restore his window,\u201d I said. \u201cWe are happy to set it right. Would he be willing to drop charges?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a reasonable man,\u201d Beau said. \u201cIt will cost you.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cBoys will be boys, Sheriff. You know how it is, they have fun and we pay the bills.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou also have Jeff Cooper to deal with,\u201d Beau said. \u201cMike\u2019s dad. He\u2019s in my front lobby fuming and making an ass of himself. He wants assault charges to be brought up.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I pulled a small plastic case from my pocket and showed him the disk inside it.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurveillance footage.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe Steel Horse has surveillance cameras?\u201d Beau came to life like a hungry wolf sighting a juicy, crippled rabbit.</p><p>\u201cThe owner installed them after that scare they had with the pandemic.\u201d A pandemic Kate had stopped before it could kill him and his wife. The Steel Horse welcomed Pack members with open arms, which was why they did nothing to help law enforcement when the Pack kids got in trouble. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t advertise this fact. Besides, they only work half of the time, when the tech is up.\u201d I flipped the disk between my fingers. \u201cShall we?\u201d</p><p>Beau took the disk out of its case and slid it into the computer on a small desk in the corner. Black-and-white images filled the screen. Three shapeshifters sitting at a table, with the girl next to Kamal. Two young guys at a table nearby with a collection of empty beer bottles said something. The shapeshifters ignored them. More taunts, this time with the waving of arms. The shorter of the two human teens picked up a basket of chicken bones and dumped it on Kamal\u2019s head. Ascanio got up, picked the guy up, and hurled him through the window. Kamal smacked him upside the head. Ascanio shrugged. The third shapeshifter, Ian, dropped some bills on the table and the group left.</p><p>\u201cIf Mr. Cooper chooses to press charges, we will do the same,\u201d I said. \u201cPlease feel free to retain the disk. I\u2019ve made copies. I do have to ask you to release the boys. I\u2019d be in your debt and they aren\u2019t a flight risk. You know where to find us: the big stone fortress just a few miles outside of town.\u201d</p><p>Beau walked to the door and stuck his head out. \u201cRifsky, get our shapeshifter guests processed out for me, will you? Also, Ms. Nash here is going to leave her information with you for Chuck\u2019s to get his window squared away.\u201d</p> <p>I suddenly remembered where I had seen the sword. It used to hang in Kate\u2019s apartment. It was her guardian\u2019s sword. Pieces of the puzzle clicked together in my head. She\u2019d used it to get me out of jail. I felt ashamed.</p><p>Beau turned to me. \u201cDon\u2019t leave town and all that, Ms. Nash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t dream of it.\u201d Now I owed Beau a favor. Wonderful.</p><p>Ten minutes later three guilty-looking shapeshifters met me on the steps. Kamal saw me and did a double take. \u201cI thought Lika was coming.\u201d</p><p>I gave him my thousand-yard stare. He shifted uncomfortably in place.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s try this again, from the beginning. You say, \u2018Hello, Beta. Thank you for coming all the way here and subjecting yourself and the Clan to public embarrassment because of my stupidity.\u2019 And I don\u2019t break your arms off.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThank you, Beta,\u201d Kamal and Ian chorused.</p><p>I looked at Ascanio. He dropped his gaze to the stairs. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you are.\u201d I started down the street to the parking lot. The three boudas followed me.</p><p>A man shoved the door open behind us. Beefy, in his late forties. His face had a lovely red color that probably meant he was about to blow his gasket. \u201cHey! Hey, you! I want to talk to you!\u201d</p><p>I kept walking. \u201cYou threw two humans through two different store windows. Enlighten me, what happens when a shapeshifter goes through a sheet of glass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Ian volunteered.</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d the man snarled. \u201cStop, God damn it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happens when a human goes through a sheet of glass?\u201d</p> <p>Nobody wanted to answer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll enlighten you, then: they get bruises, possible broken bones, and multiple lacerations. And because they don\u2019t have the benefit of Lyc-V, their broken bones will take weeks to heal and the lacerations can kill them if the broken glass happens to slice them at the right place. You almost killed them over a bucket of chicken. What in the world were you thinking?\u201d</p><p>We turned the corner, hidden from the building by the stone wall.</p><p>\u201cWe just wanted to intimidate them,\u201d Ascanio said.</p><p>The man behind us took the corner at high speed. \u201cYou fucking bitch, I said stop!\u201d</p><p>The beastkin-crazy Andrea was about to surface. I could feel it.</p><p>I looked at him. \u201cJeff Cooper, I presume?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. You degenerates think you can just come here and push people around.\u201d He stabbed his finger into my chest.</p><p>The three boudas went from chastised to baring their teeth in a blink.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t put your hand on me again,\u201d I said.</p><p>He poked his finger into my chest again. \u201cWell, I have something to tell you: don\u2019t let the sun set on you in this county, because...\u201d</p><p>I grabbed his wrist and yanked him forward, tripping him with my foot. He went down back first and I caught him by his throat, three feet above the ground, lifted him up a bit and bent down to his face. My eyes glowed with murderous red. My voice turned rough with an animal growl. \u201cListen well, because I won\u2019t be repeating myself, you racist prick. If you make any trouble for me or my people, I\u2019ll hunt you down like the pig you are and carve a second mouth across your gut. They\u2019ll find you hanging by your own intestines. The next time you hear something laugh and howl in the night, hug your family, because you won\u2019t see the sunrise.\u201d</p><p>I opened my fingers. He crashed on the ground, his face white as a sheet. He scrambled backward, rolled to his feet, and took off.</p><p>The three shapeshifters stared at me, openmouthed.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s how you intimidate people. No witnesses and not a mark on him. Get your asses to the car.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 12</p><p>It was close to noon when I finally walked through the doors of the office. Kate sat at her desk. Grendel sprawled by her feet, an enormous black monstrosity that had more in common with the hound of the Baskervilles than with any poodle I had ever seen. He saw me and wagged his tail.</p><p>I paused to pet his head. \u201cThe Consort in the flesh. You grace us with your presence, Your Majesty. I\u2019m so honored.\u201d I pressed my hand to my chest, hyperventilating. \u201cI shall alert the media posthaste!\u201d</p><p>She grimaced. \u201cHar-de-har-har. Did you have lunch yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, and I\u2019m starving. I could eat a small horse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAcropolis?\u201d Kate asked, rising.</p><p>\u201cWay ahead of you.\u201d I grabbed the file off my desk and went out the door. \u201cBy the way, we have a nice police tail that we aren\u2019t supposed to lose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe more, the merrier.\u201d</p><p>When we had both worked at the Order, Parthenon had been our favorite lunch joint. It served the best gyros. Unfortunately, now we were about forty-five minutes away from Parthenon, but we had found Acropolis, half a mile away, which was just as good if not better. It didn\u2019t have Parthenon\u2019s outdoor garden, but we made do with a secluded booth near the window in the back.</p><p>We ordered a heap of gyros, tzatziki sauce, a plate of bones for Grendel, and yummy pink-drop fruity drinks. Even with my shapeshifter senses, I had no idea what was in them and we both had decided it wasn\u2019t prudent to ask. Our police escorts, an older woman and a man in his twenties, were seated all the way across the room, by the window. For now we had privacy, at least.</p><p>I took the picture of the knife from the file and pushed it toward her. \u201cAncient knife.\u201d</p><p>She pondered it. \u201cThis is not battle-ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRaphael thought it was ceremonial.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s a fang.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a fang.\u201d She turned the picture toward me. \u201cWolf, maybe. Here, look.\u201d</p><p>She reached down and pulled Grendel\u2019s upper lip up, revealing huge canines. \u201cExactly the same.\u201d</p><p>She was right. The knife was shaped just like a canine tooth. \u201cHow did I miss this?\u201d</p><p>Kate wiped her hands on the cloth napkin. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have connected it either, except Curran gave Grendel a pork chop last night and this doofus wolfed it down and got a bone shard stuck in his gum. I had to pull it out and got a close look at his teeth. I can\u2019t seem to impress on the Beast Lord that giving him pork chops is not a good idea. He says wolves eat boars. I say that wolves never had a boar sliced into chops, which makes pork bones very sharp.\u201d</p><p>I unloaded the whole story on her, sparing no details. Kate\u2019s eyes kept getting bigger and bigger.</p><p>\u201cAnd here we are,\u201d I finished.</p><p>\u201cThe place smelled of jasmine and myrrh?\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>Kate thought for a long moment. \u201cYou said the millionaire\u2019s name was Anapa?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cI checked on it. It\u2019s some sort of small town on the Black Sea in Russia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s also in the Tell el-Amarna Tablets,\u201d she said. \u201cIn the late 1880s clay tablets were found on the site of an old Egyptian city. The tablets dated to about the fourteenth century BCE. They were probably part of some royal archive, because most of it was pharaohs\u2019 correspondence with foreign rulers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you even remember this stuff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost of the tablets are from Palestine and Babylon,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was part of my required education. Anyhow, the tablets are written in Akkadian, and the name Bel Anapa is mentioned. \u2018Bel\u2019 meant \u2018master\u2019 or \u2018lord\u2019 in Akkadian, similar to the Semitic Ba\u2019al.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike the demon Baal?\u201d</p><p>Kate grimaced. \u201cYes. They had this thing where only priests were allowed to say the god\u2019s name, so they just ba\u2019aled their gods. Similar to the way Christians use \u2018Lord\u2019 now. So some Greeks ended up thinking that Bel or Ba\u2019al meant a specific god, but it doesn\u2019t: Bel Marduk, Bel Hadad, Bel Anapa, and so on.\u201d</p><p>Great. \u201cWhich god is Anapa?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Greeks called him Anubis, God of the Dead.\u201d</p><p>Whoa.</p><p>\u201cThe one with the jackal head?\u201d I asked, raising my hands to my head to indicate ears.</p><p>Kate nodded.</p><p>Okay. No god that had \u201cof the Dead\u201d attached to it could be taken lightly. Hades, Hel, none of them were cuddly puppies. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe can\u2019t be a god,\u201d I said. \u201cThere isn\u2019t enough magic for gods. We\u2019ve established that.\u201d Gods ran on the faith of their worshippers like cars on fuel. The moment the magic receded, their flow of faith was cut off and the gods dematerialized.</p><p>\u201cHe could be just using the name,\u201d Kate said. \u201cHe could be the child of a god.\u201d</p><p>I stared at her.</p> <p>\u201cSaiman is the grandchild of a god,\u201d Kate said. \u201cAnapa could be also.\u201d</p><p>I thought of the office in Anapa\u2019s mansion. That otherworldly office no human being could\u2019ve made. \u201cDo you think the knife might be modeled after his fangs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes Anubis have any sort of helper animals?\u201d I asked. \u201cLike something about five feet tall with the jaws of a crocodile and...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBody of a lion? With a mane?\u201d Kate asked.</p> <p>Damn it. \u201cOkay. Drop it on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDemon Ammit, the Devourer of the Dead, the Eater of Hearts, the Destroyer of Souls.\u201d</p><p>I put my hand over my face.</p><p>\u201cSupposedly after receiving the soul of a recently deceased, Anubis weighs the heart against the feather of Ma\u2019at, the Goddess of Truth. If the heart is heavier, it\u2019s not pure and Ammit gets a delicious treat. The soul doesn\u2019t go to Osiris, doesn\u2019t receive immortality, and generally doesn\u2019t get to collect its two hundred dollars. Instead, it is condemned to be forever restless.\u201d Kate squinted at me. \u201cLet me guess, you nuked the Devourer of Souls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup. And since he was guarding Anapa\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe.\u201d Kate drank.</p> <p>\u201cAmmit is a girl demon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMhmm.\u201d</p><p>I sighed. \u201cWell, in any case, Anapa definitely isn\u2019t just using the name.\u201d</p><p>And if Anapa was Anubis, that meant I had officially pissed off a deity. I had never done that before.</p><p>I tapped the picture of the knife. \u201cIt could be an Egyptian knife. Ancient Crete and ancient Egypt traded. Even I know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt could be Greek, too,\u201d Kate said. \u201cThe worship of Anubis actually spread through Greece and Rome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I have an Anubis of some sort, a possibly Egyptian knife, and snakes. Lots of snakes: snake people, vipers, flying snakes...and a Russian staff with a serpentlike head. How does this all fit together?\u201d</p><p>We stared at each other.</p> <p>\u201cNo clue,\u201d Kate said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not good.\u201d</p><p>The gyros arrived. Kate pushed the plate toward me. \u201cEat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve lost at least ten pounds since I last saw you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting fashionably slender from all the exercise,\u201d I told her.</p><p>\u201cThat last time was three days ago. You\u2019re not slender, you\u2019re starving. Eat the damn food.\u201d</p><p>For ten minutes we did nothing but eat.</p><p>\u201cHow did it go with Aunt B?\u201d Kate asked.</p><p>\u201cI caved in,\u201d I said. \u201cI went to see her, sat real calm by her feet, and let her put a collar on me. She was surprisingly gracious about it.\u201d My cup was empty. I raised my glass. A waiter appeared and refilled it. \u201cThanks.\u201d I looked back at Kate. \u201cI\u2019m not actually all that bitter about it. It cost me a big chunk of my pride, but I\u2019m not bitter. I\u2019m now a Bouda beta.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCongratulations.\u201d</p><p>We clinked our glasses.</p><p>\u201cWhy the hell not? I decided that\u2019s what I want and if I have to wear Aunt B\u2019s collar for a few years to get it, so be it. I\u2019ll learn everything she knows. I\u2019ll figure out how she thinks, and then I\u2019ll use it against her. That\u2019s the bouda way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Raphael?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cI haven\u2019t decided. Anyway, Roman mentioned that the witches were all upset over a vision of the Witch Oracle. They heard howling and saw a spiral of clay. I\u2019m thinking since Anubis is involved, maybe that was a jackal howling. Would Anubis have any sort of influence over werejackals?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d have to call Jim and warn him to pull any jackals he was using out of the team working on Anapa. No need to tempt fate.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t change the subject.\u201d Kate fixed me with her stare.</p><p>\u201cWhat subject is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRaphael.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, that subject.\u201d I popped a piece of gyro into my mouth. \u201cI said I haven\u2019t decided. It\u2019s complicated.\u201d</p><p>Kate put her fork down, leaned her elbow on the table, and rested her cheek on her fist. \u201cI\u2019ve got time.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t right to lie to your best friend. Even if it was lying by omission. I chronicled my wonderful romantic adventures.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you kissed the black volhv,\u201d Kate said.</p><p>\u201cIt was tepid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTepid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, not hot, not cold, just kind of moderately warm. I feel guilty about it, actually. Roman is a good kisser. I should\u2019ve enjoyed it more. Besides, locking lips with him was the least of my problems.\u201d I counted things off on my fingers. \u201cGoing to an IM-1 zone, breaking and entering into Anapa\u2019s office, killing Anapa\u2019s demon, breaking and entering into a crime scene, stealing evidence from the crime scene, threatening a human civilian with being hung by his intestines...I\u2019m afraid your friend is gone and she\u2019s never coming back. You\u2019ve got a crazy bouda instead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about, you moron? My friend never left.\u201d</p><p>That was Kate in a nutshell. Once she became your friend, she remained your friend. Always. I bared my teeth at her. \u201cWho are you calling a moron?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou. Let me summarize: so you and Raphael had a fight and didn\u2019t talk because you hurt each other\u2019s feelings, then both of you got your feelings hurt again, because neither one of you apologized, then Raphael pretended to have a fianc\u00e9e who didn\u2019t do anything for him, and your feelings got further hurt, so you got him back by telling him that you were done, after which he went nuts and scratched MINE into your table, so you kissed a black volhv, who didn\u2019t do anything for you, and now Raphael has moved his things into your apartment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d That about summed it up.</p><p>Kate leaned toward me. \u201cWhen I was little, Voron took me to Latin America. TV still ran regular programming back then, and they had this really dramatic love story on during the week. It was full of very pretty people...\u201d</p><p>I pointed my fork at her. \u201cAre you implying that our relationship is like a Spanish soap opera?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not implying. I\u2019m saying it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re crazy.\u201d</p><p>Kate grinned. \u201cHave you traded any significant, tormented glances lately?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEat dirt, Kate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps he has a twin brother...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot another word.\u201d</p><p>She cackled over in her seat. I tried to smile back, but my smile must\u2019ve been frightening, because Kate stopped laughing. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m all fucked up.\u201d I didn\u2019t mean to say it. It just came out. \u201cI fought and fought against joining the Pack, and now I\u2019m in. I\u2019m not dumb. I\u2019m smart. I knew it would come to this, and joining the shapeshifters is to my benefit. I don\u2019t understand why I resisted it for so long. Now there is Raphael. He\u2019s behaving like an irrational lunatic, yet I\u2019m even more obsessed with him. It\u2019s like an addiction, Kate. I could just give in and make up with him, but I can\u2019t. What is wrong with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou hate being forced,\u201d Kate said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong. I have no problem with authority.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no problem with authority when you voluntarily choose to accept it. You accepted the Order\u2019s right to give you commands. If someone had come and tried to force you into the Order, you would\u2019ve fought them tooth and nail. Aunt B tried to force you to join the Pack, so you balked. But now you\u2019ve joined on your terms, voluntarily accepted her authority, and you\u2019re okay with it because it was your decision, not hers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Raphael?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRaphael is an asshole, no doubt about it. Spoiled, irrational, difficult. And you love him and feel pressure to fix things because the two of you had something great and you helped to screw it up and now you feel guilty. It\u2019s kind of up to both of you to put it back together, but you\u2019d have to forgive each other first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did you get so wise?\u201d</p><p>Kate sighed. \u201cI spend all my Wednesdays listening to the shapeshifter court issues. You wouldn\u2019t believe how often they try to use the Pack court to settle their love problems. Look, Andi, whatever you decide, I\u2019m on your side. If you want help, I will help. Just tell me what to do. If you want to sit here and mope, I will find you a hanky.\u201d</p><p>A hanky, huh? \u201cJust for that, you\u2019re going to come with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo Raphael\u2019s house. It\u2019s payback time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no. Another case of breaking and entering?\u201d A mischievous light sparked in Kate\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have to break and enter.\u201d I pulled Raphael\u2019s spare set of keys out of my pocket and jingled them. \u201cHe left me this lovely set of keys. Seems a shame not use them.\u201d</p><p>Kate laughed.</p><p>I had already made the calls before I left for my meeting with Aunt B. My evil plan was already set in motion.</p><p>I raised my pink drink. \u201cTo revenge!\u201d</p><p>Kate raised her glass and we clinked.</p><p>\u201cIt has to be really good,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cTrust me on this. It will be epic.\u201d</p><p>The front door of Raphael\u2019s house swung open. A moment later Kate appeared in the doorway of the master suite\u2019s bathroom. She was wrapped in a plastic biohazard suit.</p><p>\u201cStill clear,\u201d she reported. \u201cIt\u2019s twenty past midnight. He\u2019ll be home soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost done,\u201d I told her.</p><p>\u201cWe would be finished already if you hadn\u2019t insisted on doing the tub.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I wiped the sweat off my forehead. I had put in nearly twelve hours of work, using every iota of my shapeshifter strength and speed. Kate had helped, especially with cutting things, but I wanted my scent all over this place, not hers, which was why she was wrapped in plastic, and I wore a tank top and a pair of capris, sweating and leaving my scent signature on everything.</p><p>\u201cAlmost done,\u201d I promised again.</p><p>Kate turned. A moment later I heard it too, some sort of rumble at the front door.</p> <p>\u201cI got this,\u201d Kate said and went out with a determined look on her face.</p><p>A moment later I glued the last strip in place and stuck my head out.</p><p>Kate stood by the door with her arms crossed.</p><p>That was an anti-Curran pose. What the hell was the Beast Lord doing here?</p><p>I padded to the door.</p> <p>\u201cFirst, you didn\u2019t come home.\u201d Curran\u2019s voice held zero humor. \u201cSecond, I\u2019m told that my mate is lingering in Raphael\u2019s house. There can\u2019t be any good reason for you to be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you spying on me, Your Furriness?\u201d Kate asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, stepping into the doorway. \u201cJim has Raphael\u2019s house under surveillance.\u201d</p><p>Curran looked at me, then looked at Kate.</p><p>\u201cRevenge,\u201d Kate said. \u201cI\u2019ll explain later.\u201d</p><p>Something hissed. The three of us looked up. A dark shadow rose on the neighboring roof, and I recognized Shawn, one of Jim\u2019s people. Speak of the devil. \u201cHe\u2019s coming,\u201d Shawn hissed. \u201cRaphael\u2019s coming.\u201d</p> <p>Oh shit.</p><p>\u201cHelp!\u201d Kate held her arms out.</p><p>Curran grabbed the biohazard suit and ripped it in half, stripping it from her. Kate thrust the suit into the nearest trash can.</p><p>I ran inside the house, locked the front door, ran upstairs, lowered the attic ladder, climbed into the attic, pulled the ladder up behind me, and dashed along the beam to the corner over the living room. My surveillance nest waited for me. I\u2019d bugged the entrance and every room in the house, and now the images from the house filled my tablet. I was going to record this for posterity. I plugged the earpiece in.</p><p>Curran and Kate stood by the door.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you decided to come down here and check on me,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThe guy once handed you a fan and told you to fan yourself if the sight of his naked torso was too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was like a year ago. Will you let it go already?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d Curran grabbed her and pulled her to him, kissing her. \u201cNever.\u201d</p><p>She kissed him back and smiled.</p><p>Awww. Kate and the Beast Lord sitting in a tree...</p><p>The sound of a car pulling into the parking lot.</p><p>I scooted on my pallet of plywood. Showtime.</p><p>Raphael approached. My heart skipped a beat. He looked good. He was also carrying something long and wrapped in canvas.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d Raphael said.</p><p>Now that I looked closer, he seemed a little tired. There were slight bags under his intense blue eyes. Yeah, those sleepless nights of breaking into people\u2019s apartments and rearranging furniture must be killer.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d Kate said with a big fake smile.</p><p>Don\u2019t overdo it, woman. Come on.</p><p>Curran just stared. Jesus Christ, those two couldn\u2019t lie their way out of a paper bag.</p><p>\u201cTo what do I owe the pleasure?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWe have something important...to discuss,\u201d Curran said.</p><p>I hit my hand on my face. Brilliant, Your Majesty. Not suspicious at all.</p><p>\u201cIn private. Inside,\u201d Kate said.</p><p>Raphael looked at Curran then slowly at Kate. \u201cPlease come in. I\u2019m sorry I wasn\u2019t here sooner. For some reason all of the plumbing in the Clan Bouda House came apart and my mother called me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, came apart?\u201d Kate asked.</p><p>\u201cI mean that every coupling and fitting in the house has been pulled open,\u201d Raphael said.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you were in the plumbing repair business,\u201d Curran said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in the good son business. I couldn\u2019t leave my mother in the house with no running water.\u201d Raphael opened the door. \u201cSome idiot likely pulled a prank. It\u2019s a house full of boudas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d Kate asked pointing at the bundle.</p><p>\u201cAn apology for being a selfish asshole.\u201d Raphael unwrapped the canvas, revealing the instantly identifiable shape of a high-tech compound bow: low-tech bows were bent outward, like a crescent, but this bow\u2019s center bent inward, toward the archer. I zoomed in. Lightweight, a hollow carbon fiber riser with the telltale Celtic knot grid pattern, dampers to absorb the recoil vibration, ornate cams, string suppressors...Oh Jesus Christ, he was holding an Ifor compound bow. Sleekest, leanest, meanest bow on the market, with pinpoint accuracy and a vibration-free shot delivered in complete silence. It wasn\u2019t a bow, it was death wrapped in a dream and twenty-first-century engineering. They were made in Wales by a single artisan family, one at a time. I had been trying to buy one for ages, but there was a waiting list a mile long and UK buyers were given a strong preference. How could he even get one? Where?</p><p>\u201cDo you think she\u2019ll like it?\u201d Raphael asked.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll love it,\u201d Kate said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think buying her things will work.\u201d</p><p>For me! The bow was for me! I dropped my tablet.</p><p>Raphael glanced up. \u201cDid you hear something?\u201d</p><p>Oh crap.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Curran said. \u201cCan we come in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Raphael wrapped the bow back up.</p><p>I switched to the foyer camera.</p><p>The door swung open.</p><p>I held my breath.</p><p>Raphael stepped inside.</p><p>I tapped the screen, splitting it in two and zooming the right half on his face.</p><p>Raphael opened his mouth and froze.</p><p>The entire house was covered in purple ultra-long shag carpet. It wasn\u2019t just purple, it was bright, vivid, psychotic grape-purple. It made my eyes bleed after a mere five seconds. Medrano Reclamations had pulled miles of it out of some warehouse they had reclaimed, and Stefan had sold the entire lot to me dirt cheap, because nobody in their right mind would ever buy it.</p><p>I had covered everything: the floor, the walls, the ceiling. The elegant couches, the dark rough-wood coffee table, the swords on the wall, the fireplace. I had wrapped the logs in the fireplace.</p><p>Raphael just stood there and stared, his face a mask of utter shock.</p><p>Behind him Curran froze in place. Kate put her hand over her mouth, trying not to laugh.</p><p>Slowly Raphael walked inside over what once had been his pricy tile and now was just a sea of cushy, hideous purple, and looked at the kitchen.</p><p>The island was a block of carpet. I had wrapped his pots and pans hanging from the frame identical to the one he had installed at my place. I had wrapped the frame. The fridge. The stove. The butcher block, each knife handle wrapped lovingly in the purple nightmare.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Kate said. \u201cI had no idea you liked carpet so much, Raphael.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it that you wanted to discuss?\u201d Raphael asked, his voice monotone.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll do it later,\u201d Curran said. \u201cYou\u2019re obviously too tired. Come on, Kate.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated. \u201cBut...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to go and do that other thing we need to do.\u201d He pulled her away and they went out. The door clicked shut.</p><p>Slowly, as if in a dream, Raphael opened the carpet-sheathed cabinet. A stack of carpeted plates looked back at him. I didn\u2019t have the time to do absolutely everything, so I had only done the plates. I knew he would open that cabinet. That\u2019s where he usually went first.</p><p>Raphael drew his hand over his face.</p><p>Slowly the shock drained away from his face. He inhaled deeply.</p><p>That\u2019s right, darling. Drink me in.</p><p>He went back into the living room and checked the windows, one by one. Slowly, unhurriedly he made his way upstairs to the master suite.</p><p>I switched to a different camera.</p><p>The bed was purple, too. He locked the windows and walked into the bathroom. The tub was carpet. The toilet was carpet. I had cut carpet into a long strip and threaded it onto the toilet paper holder.</p><p>He turned and finally noticed a mirror, the lonely spot in the synthetic moss that had sprouted all over his apartment. On it I had written in red lipstick, \u201cYour personal padded room.\u201d</p><p>Raphael raised his head and looked up. An evil smile curved his lips. He was almost unbearably handsome.</p><p>\u201cAndreeaaaa,\u201d he called, his voice seductive and wicked.</p><p>I gulped.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re here.\u201d His voice was like a purr wrapped in a growl. \u201cYou could never resist seeing me take this all in.\u201d</p><p>Bastard knew me too well. I tried to breathe quietly.</p><p>His shoes came off. He stretched.</p><p>\u201cAndreaaa...\u201d</p><p>His voice sent tiny caresses all over my skin.</p><p>Raphael raised his face and inhaled, sampling the air. He seemed slightly feral.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to find you,\u201d he promised.</p><p>Oh no.</p><p>He followed my scent out of the master suite.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t hide from me. I know you, I know how you think. I know you\u2019re watching me. Did you wire the house?\u201d</p><p>He was hunting me.</p><p>Fear dashed through me, mixed with delicious excitement. The tiny hairs on the back of my neck rose.</p><p>He reached the attic.</p><p>My heart was beating a thousand beats per minute.</p><p>He reached for the cord.</p><p>Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.</p><p>The attic\u2019s ladder slid down.</p><p>I took a deep breath.</p><p>Raphael put his foot on the first step.</p><p>I leaped up, tore my surveillance screen away from the cables, and tried to hurl myself through the attic window. And ran right into bars. Trapped.</p><p>Raphael\u2019s head appeared in the attic doorway. He saw me.</p><p>I dropped my stuff and braced myself.</p><p>Slowly, lazily he climbed the stairs. One step, two...</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll never take me alive,\u201d I told him. It felt appropriate.</p><p>He stepped into the attic. \u201cYou got it all wrong. The plan is for you to take me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He pulled his shirt off. His scent hit me. He opened his arms...</p><p>I jumped him.</p><p>We collided. The smell of him, the feel of him, the heat of his skin on mine, oh my God, this cannot be happening. He kissed me on the mouth, searing hot. \u201cI love you. I\u2019m so sorry. I\u2019m so sorry I was an ass...\u201d</p> <p>I couldn\u2019t even talk. I just kissed him, running my hands over his chest, over his muscled back, touching his hard ridged stomach, wanting him inside me, wanting to be one. He slid his hands under my T-shirt, and I pulled it off, in a desperate hurry. He touched me again, pulling me into his arms, and it felt so right, so good, so sensual that I trembled. I slid my hands into his pants and stroked the hot hardness of his shaft. I wanted to feel him inside me, sliding in and out. I wanted the ultimate proof that he was mine and that I was his, and I was hot and slick and ready. All of my tricks went out the window, and I just rubbed against him, tasting his skin and purring. He kissed my neck, sliding his tongue along the sensitive spots, and then he lost it, too. Somehow, intertwined, we made it down the attic steps into the hallway.</p><p>We had had sex hundreds of times. We had tried dozens of positions, we had flirted with our kinks, we had long ago learned how and where to touch to make each other moan and gasp and to delay each other\u2019s pleasure until the sweet anticipation of release became almost torture...and we used none of it. We made love in the tried-and-true missionary position right there on the hideous purple carpet in the hallway, awkward and impatient, fumbling about like two virgin teenagers caught in a selfless race to make the other happy.</p><p>It was the best sex I had ever had.</p><p>My eyes snapped open. I lay in the hallway. Raphael\u2019s arm was wrapped around me. The carpet under us smelled like sex and plastic.</p><p>The ceiling was steeped in shadows. Raphael\u2019s drapes were open and they streamed down on both sides of the window. Moonlight flooded the city and struck the latticework of steel and silver bars on the window, setting them aglow with delicate radiance. The magic was up.</p> <p>I glanced at the clock. Two a.m. I\u2019d barely had an hour of sleep.</p><p>Something had woken me.</p><p>A deep rumbling noise rolled through the house.</p><p>My body went from drowsy and tired to full alert in half a second. Next to me Raphael sat up.</p><p>The sound came again, a low, deep tone like a muted roar of the bull alligator mixed with the bellow of a bull.</p><p>The window.</p> <p>I jumped to my feet and ran to the window. Raphael got there at the same time. We pressed to the wall on the opposite sides of the window frame and edged the curtains aside.</p><p>Ammit stood below, its long-jawed, heavy head raised up. Its eyes stared at us. It didn\u2019t seem hostile. It simply waited.</p><p>Raphael and I traded glances.</p><p>He slid the window open. \u201cHi there.\u201d</p><p>Ammit stared at us.</p><p>\u201cShoo! Go away, girl!\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cGirl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKate says it\u2019s female.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an Egyptian demon who devours souls.\u201d</p><p>Raphael sighed. It was a dejected, I am so tired of this crap sigh and it made me want to hug him.</p><p>Ammit stared at us.</p><p>\u201cIf only I had a bow,\u201d I murmured. \u201cI could totally shoot it in the eye from here. Boom, arrow to the brain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour bow is on the table downstairs. Do you like it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the most beautiful thing in the world.\u201d Aside from him and Baby Rory.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you get one?\u201d</p><p>He smiled at me, that handsome, slightly evil Raphael smile. \u201cIt\u2019s a secret.\u201d</p><p>I ran downstairs to fetch the bow. When I returned, Raphael still stood by the window. \u201cIt could go through the door to get to us,\u201d Raphael said. \u201cSo why doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>We peered at Ammit.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, girl?\u201d Raphael asked, his voice coaxing. \u201cDid Timmy fall down the well?\u201d</p><p>Ammit said nothing.</p><p>\u201cIt would be crazy to go out there,\u201d Raphael said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d have to be insane.\u201d</p><p>I pulled on my pants, socks, and sneakers. Raphael pulled out two fresh T-shirts from a chest by the basket of clean laundry and tossed one to me. I grabbed my Ifor, he got his knives, and we took off down the stairs.</p><p>Outside, the night was bright. Pale bluish vapor rose from the chunks of concrete that made up the low wall around the house\u2014something magic must\u2019ve been brought out by the moonlight. I drew my bow and we snuck around the building, moving silently, carefully walking on the balls of our feet.</p><p>Step.</p><p>Another step.</p><p>I turned the corner and the tip of my arrow touched Ammit\u2019s nose. It\u2019s amazing how far you can jump backward, if properly motivated.</p><p>Raphael stepped around me and approached the massive beast. We had killed it. I could still picture its corpse in my mind, fresh and vivid, the blood, the dulled eyes, the great maw gaping lifelessly, spilling the tongue on the ground. Yet there it stood.</p><p>Raphael reached out.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d I warned.</p><p>He touched its head, petting its cheek. The tentacles of Ammit\u2019s mane twisted toward him and slid harmlessly off his hand.</p><p>The beast sighed. Two clouds of moist vapor escaped its nostrils.</p><p>It didn\u2019t open its crocodile mouth and bite Raphael\u2019s hand off.</p><p>Slowly Ammit turned, trotted forward a few feet, and looked at us over its muscular shoulder.</p><p>You\u2019ve got to be kidding me.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>The jaws gaped open and the roar rolled forth, primal and ancient, so much older than the city around it, so alien that I wondered for a second if the illusion of Atlanta would tear under the force of that primeval call and I would end up standing in the muddy, rich waters of the Nile. I could almost see the tall slender reeds shifting in the night breeze.</p><p>The roar sang through my veins, urging me to follow.</p><p>Ammit took a step forward and looked at us.</p><p>\u201cShould we?\u201d I murmured.</p><p>Raphael shrugged. \u201cAlright, Lassie. Lead on.\u201d</p><p>The great beast started down the slope, and we followed. Ammit built to a fast trot. We ran through the magic-soaked city. My feet were weightless, and we devoured the distance, swallowing mile after mile, tireless and exhilarated.</p><p>Tendrils of faint orange vapor curled from the beast, streaming from its mane and back. Its magic enveloped me. It felt so right, running like this, hunting like this, next to Raphael. Lean, muscular, the white T-shirt molded to his body, he ran with grace and power, his long legs in gray Pack sweatpants carrying him forward. His skin almost glowed. Sweat dampened his dark hair. His dark eyes focused on something far ahead.</p><p>The compound bow in my hand could be made of horn, wood, and sinew. The oversized white T-shirt Raphael had given me could be a tunic. The asphalt under my feet could be sand or the dry red soil of low hills. The air smelled of lotus and water lily, and sometimes of dew-soaked jasmine, and then of dry desert.</p><p>Ammit stopped and I almost cried out. I wanted to keep running.</p><p>The reality came back, fading in through the magic. We were in front of the Cutting Edge office.</p><p>The magic of Ammit swirled around us, evaporating slowly, like distant notes of perfume dissipating from the skin.</p><p>A second Ammit thundered down the street toward us, a huge black horse following it. Roman dismounted next to us, his staff in his hand. He wore a tank top and black pajama pants with an Eeyore pattern.</p><p>\u201cI have had it with this shit,\u201d he announced. \u201cI got woken up in the middle of the night, didn\u2019t get any sleep again, rode across the whole damned city, nu na cherta mne ato nuzhno.\u201d He waved his hand in front of his face. \u201cDamn magic everywhere, making me sneeze.\u201d</p><p>The Ammit next to him opened its mouth. Roman whacked it with the top of his staff on the nose. \u201cYou\u2014shut up.\u201d</p><p>The Ammit looked just like a cat who had gotten popped with a newspaper: half-shocked, half-outraged. Roman surveyed the two of us. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you two? Why do you look all dazed?\u201d</p><p>The magic melted, taking the visions of the Nile with it. My mind struggled to formulate a coherent thought, any thought. I opened my mouth. \u201cYour pajamas have Eeyore on them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like Eeyore. He\u2019s sensible. A sober outlook on life never hurt anyone.\u201d</p><p>Raphael shook his head, trying to clear it. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>Roman grimaced. \u201cHow would I know? Last night I helped Andrea and then a winged gadina took my staff, and tonight I woke up with this varmint howling under my window.\u201d</p><p>Raphael turned to me. \u201cLast night? After I called you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you call me to come and help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I call you? You can\u2019t do magic.\u201d</p><p>The wheels slowly turned in Raphael\u2019s head. He looked at Roman. \u201cHow long have you been helping her?\u201d</p><p>Roman\u2019s face took on a dangerous expression. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, since when do I answer to you, exactly?\u201d</p><p>The two men squared off. Great. I tried the door of the office. Unlocked.</p><p>Raphael stepped forward. Roman did, too. They stood dangerously close.</p><p>\u201cI asked you a question,\u201d Raphael said, his voice saturated with menace.</p><p>Roman\u2019s voice turned icy. \u201cAnd I told you to fuck yourself. Which part wasn\u2019t clear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d I snapped.</p><p>They looked at me.</p><p>\u201cThe door is open,\u201d I said. \u201cYou can stay out here and compare inches for the entire night, but I\u2019m going inside.\u201d</p><p>I swung the door open and stepped across the threshold.</p><p>The office was bathed in a gentle yellow glow. The air smelled of sweet myrrh, fiery cinnamon, balsam, and the smoky, spicy mix of thyme and marjoram. The pungent aroma didn\u2019t seem to drift but saturated the room, hanging in the air, filling the place.</p><p>I stepped inside. My desk and Kate\u2019s were missing. Four braziers, bronze dishes filled with some sort of fuel on tall metal stems, burned bright, set on both sides of a large chair. In the chair sat Anapa. He rested his cheek on his hand, bent at the elbow and leaning on the chair\u2019s armrest, one long leg over the other. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Flames played in his eyes. He looked absurd, sitting there in his makeshift throne room, wearing a three-piece black suit. Thought he owned this place, did he?</p><p>I crossed my arms. \u201cLove the makeover. The room has so much more space now. How much do we owe you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d Roman asked behind me.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s Anubis, God of the Dead,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cThe name is Inepu,\u201d Anapa said.

Don\u2019t have enough juice.\u201d He turned to me and Raphael. \u201cTrust me, I\u2019ve tried to summon one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy the hell would you summon a god?\u201d Raphael asked.</p><p>\u201cHe was trying to kill his cousin,\u201d Anapa said.</p> <p>\u201cThat was a long time ago.\u201d Roman waved his hand.</p><p>Anapa\u2019s lips curved, and he smiled a bright genuine smile, suffused with humor. \u201cNo, that was last May.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I said, a long time ago,\u201d Roman said.</p><p>Anapa laughed and pointed his finger at Roman. \u201cI like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you a god?\u201d Raphael asked.</p><p>Anapa waved his hand. \u201cYes and no. The answer is complicated.\u201d</p> <p>Right, we were too stupid to understand it. \u201cI\u2019m sure we can scrape enough brain cells together between the three of us. Indulge us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no need for such hostility, Andrea Marie. I\u2019m not your enemy. Well, not yet.\u201d</p><p>So he knew my middle name. So what.</p><p>Anapa shrugged. \u201cI suppose I will explain this to you, so you will stop wondering about it. We have important subjects to discuss and I\u2019ll need your full attention. When magic began to fade from the world, I took a mortal form and fathered a child, pouring all my essence into it. Then I fell asleep. My child in turn had a child, and he had a child, and on and on, my lineage stretched throughout time, until the returning magic awoke me. As I became aware, I hovered on the verge of existence until my descendant decided to do as most men do and bred with a charming woman. I called to my essence within the bloodline and merged with the beginning life during the moment of conception. In a sense, I fathered myself into being. You could say I am an avatar. Neat trick, huh?\u201d He winked at us.</p><p>The human part of him kept him alive during the tech. That also meant he was weak while the magic was gone. Weak was good. \u201cI thought you\u2019d look more Egyptian,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cAnd how do you think the original Egyptians looked?\u201d Anapa raised his eyebrows. \u201cWhat do you know of us? Were you there at the birth of the glory that was Egypt? Were you there to watch as we mixed with Nubians, Hittites, Libyans, Assyrians, Persians, and Greeks, you dumb little puppy? Colors, pigments, texture of skin and hair, those things are mere glaze. The vessel underneath is always clay.\u201d</p><p>This was above my pay grade. \u201cRoman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe might be a nut job,\u201d Roman said. \u201cIf he\u2019s telling the truth, he isn\u2019t at full strength.\u201d</p> <p>Anapa sighed. \u201cSo tiresome. Very well.\u201d</p><p>Wind swept through the office, streaming from behind Anapa\u2014hot, heavy with moisture, streaked with decay, the odor of spiced wine, and heady aromas of resins. The flames bent away from Anapa. A jackal howled, a long eerie wail that gripped my throat in a ghostly fist and squeezed.</p><p>The man on the chair leaned forward. A translucent outline shimmered along his skin, expanded, and a different creature sat in Anapa\u2019s place. He was tall, long-limbed, and lean. A network of muscle bound his torso, crisply defined, but far from bulky. His skin was a warm, rich brown with a touch of terra-cotta. His face with its wide brown eyes was beautiful, but it wasn\u2019t the kind of beauty you wanted to touch\u2014it radiated too much power, too much regal disdain. As he looked at us, the contours of his head flowed like molten wax. His nose and jaw protruded forward and narrowed to a dark nose. Two long ears thrust up. Black and gray fur sheathed his face. The flash of white fangs in his mouth was like lightning.</p><p>Magic streamed from him, potent, powerful, overwhelming.</p><p>He rose from the chair, an impossibility, a man with a human torso and a jackal head. Outside, the two Ammit roared in unison. The press of his magic was impossible to bear.</p><p>The illusion shattered. I realized I had forgotten to breathe and sucked in air in a hoarse gulp.</p><p>Anapa smiled at me, sitting in his chair again, languid and mildly amused. \u201cNow, that we have that settled, let\u2019s talk. I have a bone to pick with you. All three of you, as a matter of fact.\u201d</p><p>Raphael took a step forward. \u201cI will reimburse you for the beast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe one you killed?\u201d Anapa\u2019s animated face turned puzzled. \u201cOh, there was no need. I resurrected her the moment the magic wave appeared. I did very much enjoy your battle. A stunning display of strategic thinking.\u201d He looked at me and then at Raphael. \u201cYou and you, you work well together.\u201d He turned to Raphael. \u201cExcept at the end when both of you went a little mad.\u201d</p><p>A muscle jerked in Raphael\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d Anapa wrinkled his nose. \u201cHappens to the best of us.\u201d</p><p>Raphael took a step forward. I put my hand on his forearm.</p><p>Anapa rubbed his hands together. \u201cNow we\u2019ll have ourselves a bit of show-and-tell, shall we?\u201d</p><p>The floor of the office between him and us turned lighter. Stylized figures formed on its surface.</p><p>\u201cNeat, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Anapa grinned. \u201cI got an idea from an old movie. So, listen and watch. Please feel free to sit down if you wish.\u201d</p><p>Brown figures came down from the hills toward the blue river.</p><p>\u201cThat would be the ancient Egyptian cattle herders. The climate changed, and all of their grass fields are drying out, so they have to go back to the Nile. Look at them, they are so sad.\u201d</p><p>The figures fell to their knees and started drinking from the Nile. On the other side a second group of figures started throwing rocks at the newcomers.</p><p>\u201cThose are the people who had remained in the valley. They don\u2019t want the poor cattle herders there. See, they are all upset.\u201d</p><p>One of the figures held up a crooked staff.</p><p>A huge triangular head broke the surface of the water. An enormous brown and yellow snake slithered out of the Nile and began to feed on the newcomers.</p><p>Anapa leaned forward. \u201cThat would Apep. The God of the River. These guys, the ones who stayed in the valley, they worshipped him, so he wouldn\u2019t eat them. He is a nasty bugger.\u201d</p><p>The dismembered bodies of the ancient Egyptians fell in the water.</p><p>\u201cBut what\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>Four figures appeared, shaking swords and spears. One had a hawk head, the second had a cat\u2019s head, the third a jackal\u2019s, and the fourth seemed to be a bizarre cross between a donkey and aardvark.</p><p>\u201cThat would be Ra, his daughter Bast, me, and Set.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that myth,\u201d Roman said. \u201cIt was Ra who killed him.\u201d</p><p>Anapa looked at him in mild outrage. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, were you there? No. Then hush. Of course, myths say that Ra killed him. That\u2019s what you get when you\u2019re a sun god and crops depend on you, my friend. Look, I\u2019ll prove it to you.\u201d An ancient mural appeared on the wall, showing a yellow spotted cat resembling a mountain cat stabbing a snake with a curved blade. \u201cSupposedly this is Ra slaying Apep. Small problem: Ra has a hawk\u2019s head on his shoulders. He doesn\u2019t turn into a cat, except for this one time. Keep that in mind. Now where were we?\u201d</p><p>The four figures attacked the serpent, chopping at him with strange curved swords and poking him with spears. The serpent flailed, knocking them aside, and biting at their bodies. Finally the picture-Anubis turned into a huge jackal and bit Apep\u2019s neck, clamping it down. The three other figures rushed him. The snake convulsed, knocking aside everyone except for Bast. The nimble cat jumped over the flailing body and stabbed the serpent in the heart.</p><p>\u201cSo why do the myths say that Ra killed him?\u201d Roman said.</p><p>\u201cBecause priests were men and we can\u2019t have the big enemy getting killed by a girl, can we now?\u201d Anapa winked at me. \u201cHoly texts are written by committee, and Ra had more priests. His cult was stronger. He is the sun, the life-giver, while Bast was only the protector of Lower Egypt. She used to be a lioness. Very fierce. By the time the priests were done with her, she\u2019d turned into a domestic kitty cat. Took them a thousand years or so, but they crippled the lion.\u201d</p><p>A bright flash of light exploded from Apep\u2019s body, knocking the four figures down.</p><p>\u201cLook at us, all knocked out.\u201d Anapa smiled. \u201cLots of magic is released when you kill a god. Look at me there. See, I only have one fang? It broke off in the snake\u2019s neck. Took me two days to grow a new one.\u201d</p><p>The light faded. The four gods still lay prone on the ground. Little figures swarmed Apep, chopping his body to pieces.</p><p>\u201cWho are they?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cSaii. His priests. They\u2019re trying to save parts of him. That one took a scale. And this one got a vertebrae.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose four are eating the corpse.\u201d Raphael pointed at the four figures on all fours biting Apep\u2019s side.</p><p>\u201cThey are devouring his flesh, so it will live through them. Nasty business.\u201d</p><p>The final person pried Anubis\u2019s fang from Apep\u2019s dead body and the figures ran away.</p><p>\u201cOf course, we chased them, but they were crafty,\u201d Anapa said. \u201cThey scattered to the four winds, hoping to eventually reunite and resurrect their god.\u201d Anapa clapped his hands. The mural faded. \u201cAnd that brings us to our current calamity, gentlemen and the lady, of course.\u201d</p><p>The god smiled and pointed at Raphael. \u201cYou cost me my fang. It was dipped in metal and made to look like a knife, but inside it\u2019s still my tooth with the blood of Apep in it. It was in the vault of that damned ruin and you had to buy it out from under me.\u201d He turned to Roman. \u201cYou lost the staff carved from the vertebrae of Apep and his rib. They hid it in a room full of magical artifacts, so their magic would mask its location from me. You found it, took it out, and instead of taking it someplace safe, you practically served it back to them on a silver platter. Your own holy relic. Here is your award for stupidity. Congratulations.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Roman opened his mouth and clamped it shut.</p><p>Anapa turned to me. \u201cAnd you helped them both, stuck your nose where it didn\u2019t belong, set the other furballs on me, and made my life difficult all around. I can\u2019t move around the city, because there are two of your kind following me like a tail follows a dog. And half of the time, one of them is a cat. Do you have any idea how much I despise cats?\u201d</p><p>Anapa took a long, calming breath. \u201cRight now, Apep\u2019s cult has the staff, the fang, and likely at least a few descendants of the Saii, the four priests who engaged in that creative gastronomy. So the question is, what are we going to do about it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat happens if Apep is resurrected?\u201d Raphael asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, let us review.\u201d Anapa leaned back. \u201cHe is the god of darkness, chaos, and evil. Let us agree to put aside philosophical concepts of evil and good, as they are subjective. What is evil for one is good for another. Let\u2019s talk instead about chaos. Chaos, as our priest here will tell you, is an extremely powerful force. Do any of you know what a fractal is?\u201d</p><p>Roman raised his hand.</p><p>Anapa grimaced. \u201cI know you know. Here.\u201d</p><p>A dark equilateral triangle ignited on the floor.</p> <p>Anapa waved his hand. A smaller equilateral triangle appeared in the middle of the darker one, its corners touching the sides of the original triangle.</p><p>\u201cHow many triangles?\u201d Anapa asked.</p><p>\u201cFive,\u201d I said. \u201cThree dark, one light in the middle, and the big one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgain,\u201d Anapa said.</p><p>A smaller light triangle appeared in the middle of each dark triangle.</p><p>\u201cAgain. Again. Again.\u201d</p> <p>He stopped, pointing at the filigree of triangles on the floor. \u201cI could go on to infinity. In basic terms, a fractal is a system that doesn\u2019t become simpler when analyzed on smaller and smaller levels. Keep that in your head.\u201d</p><p>A system that can\u2019t be broken down to basic components. Okay, got it.</p><p>Anapa leaned forward. \u201cTo understand chaos, you have to understand mathematics. A lot of your civilization\u2014most of any civilization, really\u2014is built on mathematical analysis, the guiding principle of which is that everything can be explained and understood, if you just break it into small enough chunks. In other words, everything has an end. If you dig deep enough into any complex system, you will eventually unearth its simplest parts, which can\u2019t be broken down any further. That sort of thinking works for a great many things, but not all of them. For example, the fractal. It doesn\u2019t end.\u201d</p><p>I felt like I was back in the Order\u2019s Academy at some lecture. \u201cThis is surreal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe fractal?\u201d Anapa asked.</p><p>\u201cYou. Explaining this.\u201d</p><p>Anapa gave a long-suffering sigh. \u201cWhat do you know about me?\u201d</p><p>And now I\u2019d been singled out of the class. \u201cYou are the deity of funeral rites.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd what else?\u201d</p><p>Umm...</p><p>\u201cMedicine. The exploration of biology and metaphysics. Knowledge. This is my primary function. I impart knowledge. I teach. One can\u2019t just give man fire. It\u2019s like giving a toddler a box of matches\u2014he will burn the house down. You must teach him how to use it.\u201d Anapa shook his head. \u201cBack to the fractal. It can\u2019t be explained by mathematical analysis, so humanity, as it so often does, declared it to be a mathematical curiosity and swept it under the rug. Except the fractal occurs again and again.\u201d</p><p>An earthworm appeared on the floor of the office.</p><p>\u201cA line,\u201d Anapa said. \u201cSo simple.\u201d</p><p>He sliced the air with his finger. The earthworm divided in two. Two became four, four became eight, eight became sixteen, more and more. A swarm of worms roiled and writhed on the floor.</p><p>Anapa pondered the knot of bodies. \u201cLeft to its own devices, nature defaults to a fractal. A human settlement is a fractal. It is a complex system with randomly interacting components that is adaptive on every level. The pattern of the evolution of a single cell to complex organism is a fractal. The way man approaches his quest for knowledge is a fractal. Think of it: biology, the study of living things. A simple concept.\u201d</p><p>A straight line appeared on the floor.</p><p>\u201cAs man accumulates knowledge, the volume of information becomes too much. He feels the need to subdivide it.\u201d</p><p>The line split into three branches marked with labels: zoology, botany, anatomy, then split again. Botany grew horticulture, forestry, plant morphology, plant systematics. Zoology splintered into zoological morphology and systematics, then into comparative anatomy, systematics, animal physiology, behavioral ecology...It kept building and building, splitting, growing, branching, too fast, too much, overwhelming...</p><p>\u201cMake it stop.\u201d I didn\u2019t even realize I said it, until I heard my mouth produce the words.</p><p>The line disappeared.</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s the crux of our problem,\u201d Anapa said, his voice contemplative. \u201cMan can\u2019t handle the chaos. Oh, you can understand it in abstract, as long as you don\u2019t think about it too hard. But at the core of it, whenever humans come against chaos, they deal with it in one of three ways. They hide from it, pretending it isn\u2019t there. They dress it up in pretty clothes. The God of the Hebrews is a fractal. He can do anything, he knows everything, he is infinite in his power and complexity. He is a fractal, so humanity felt the need to compartmentalize him. They don\u2019t tackle the concept head-on. They tiptoe around it by telling little fables and anecdotes about their deity, and then when push came to shove, they invented a new aspect of him, his son, who comes with a more narrow, definitive message of infinite love.\u201d</p><p>Anapa fell silent.</p><p>\u201cYou said there were three ways,\u201d Raphael said.</p><p>\u201cI did, didn\u2019t I? Faced with chaos you will either ignore it, dance around it, or you will go mad. Apep is chaos. He is a primal expression of a fundamental principle, a fractal, a force rather than a deity. The priests of Egypt worshipped against him just to keep him at bay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you worship against something?\u201d Raphael asked.</p><p>\u201cLet me tell you: once a year they got together, made a fake Apep, threw a big party, and burned him with great ceremony. There are actual rules for how to properly defile him. First, we spit on Apep. Then we stomp on him with our left foot. Then we use a lance to stab Apep, and so on. Do you see how they attempted to impose order upon chaos through a complex ritual?\u201d</p><p>Anapa leaned forward. \u201cIf let loose, Apep will drive humanity insane. You will devolve into primeval barbarism where nothing exists except his worship in its most rudimentary form. You will abandon reason and logic and feed yourselves to him by the thousands like the idiots you are.\u201d</p><p>The shadow outline of a jackal\u2019s head flared around Anapa\u2019s head. His dark lips trembled, betraying a glimpse of his fangs. \u201cSo you see, I have a vested interest in this venture. In the presence of Apep, no other god can exist. I want to prevent his resurrection, and if he manages to resurrect, I have to murder him again. And the three of you will help me.\u201d</p><p>Silence descended. My mind struggled to get a grip. Too much information to process. \u201cIf Apep is so terrible, why do they want to resurrect him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause they are outcasts,\u201d Anapa said. \u201cThey are unlike others. They grow snake fangs in their mouths, they have jaws that open too wide, and they know that others are repulsed by it. They seek to belong. They want to know where they came from and they want to take pride in who they are. They probably think Apep will protect them and he will. It\u2019s just the rest of humanity that will be on his menu.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want the staff,\u201d Roman said suddenly.</p><p>\u201cMmm?\u201d Anapa looked at him.</p><p>\u201cI want the staff,\u201d the black volhv repeated. \u201cIf I do this, you will not harm me and will give me the Bone Staff to take back to my people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Anapa waved his hand.</p><p>I stared at Roman. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m imposing order on a fractal,\u201d Roman said. \u201cIf I define the terms of the bargain, he\u2019s bound by them. He can\u2019t do anything else to me.\u201d</p><p>Anapa leaned back and laughed.</p><p>Raphael stepped forward. His face was grim and I saw determination in the set of his jaw. Uh-oh.</p><p>\u201cYou have a problem with me over the knife. Why didn\u2019t you just ask for the knife?\u201d Raphael said.</p><p>\u201cBecause the less you knew about this mess, the better,\u201d Anapa said. \u201cGiven half a chance, humans will screw things up, as the three of you have so deftly proven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you deliberately kept me in the dark, and now you want to blame me for my ignorance? That isn\u2019t fair.\u201d</p><p>Anapa\u2019s gaze fixed on him. \u201cI am a god. I don\u2019t do fair.\u201d</p><p>Raphael met it. \u201cYou have a problem with me, fine. Leave her out of this. She didn\u2019t do anything to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Anapa said.</p><p>Oh, Raphael. Why would you think I would stand for that?</p><p>\u201cIf you want my help, let her off the hook.\u201d Raphael growled.</p><p>Anapa shook his head. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>The ghostly jackal head appeared around Anubis. \u201cWho are you to question me?\u201d</p><p>Raphael\u2019s lips trembled, betraying a flash of his teeth. \u201cShe goes free with no obligation to participate in your scheme. That\u2019s my price.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRejected.\u201d</p><p>They stared at each other. Muscles tensed on Raphael\u2019s frame. I smelled a brawl.</p><p>A third of me wanted to rip Raphael\u2019s head off for the insult. I was perfectly capable of holding my own. I didn\u2019t need his help to extricate me, nor did I need his grand sacrifice. Another third was all bursting at the seams with happiness: when facing a god, his first thought wasn\u2019t about saving himself but about keeping me safe. He was willing to fight a god of chaos to keep me out of this mess. The final third of me just howled in blind terror, terrified for my safety, and even more terrified for the idiot bouda who was trying to buy my life with his.</p><p>And that was my relationship with Raphael in a nutshell: too complicated. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>If I didn\u2019t do something, the fool would throw himself away.

They lack the scale. It was made into a shield. I need you to get it before the priests do.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just get it yourself?\u201d Raphael asked.</p><p>\u201cBecause I am a god.

Tell her to bring another deer. She will know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to move a finger unless you give me clear and simple instructions without mystical bullshit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not my way,\u201d Anapa said. \u201cYou will take your instructions in whatever form I choose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m out.\u201d Chew on that, why don\u2019t you.</p><p>\u201cIs that your final word?\u201d Anapa said.</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. We\u2019ll do it the hard way.\u201d</p><p>A girl walked out of the back room. She couldn\u2019t have been more than seven or eight. She moved slowly, as if unsure where her feet were. Her eyes, dark and opened wide, were blank. Her dark skin had an ashen tint.</p><p>I tensed. Next to me Raphael bent his knees slightly, preparing for a leap.</p><p>\u201cThis is Brandy.\u201d</p><p>Brandy looked at us with her empty eyes.</p><p>\u201cBrandy is a shapeshifter like you. From Clan Jackal. The jackals and I share a certain bond.\u201d Anapa studied his nails, looking bored. \u201cI plucked her out at random. Her parents are frantically looking for her by now, I\u2019d imagine. Why don\u2019t you tell them how you feel, Brandy?\u201d</p><p>The child opened her mouth. \u201cHelp,\u201d a weak tiny voice said. \u201cHelp...me.\u201d</p><p>I yanked the bow off my shoulder and aimed an arrow at Anapa\u2019s left eye. Raphael exploded in a riot of fur and muscle, snarling as the monster that was a bouda in a warrior form spilled into existence.</p><p>\u201cLet the child go.\u201d I sank the promise of death into my voice.</p><p>\u201cEvery day you do not do as you are told, I\u2019ll take another Jackal child at sunset,\u201d Anapa said. \u201cIf the lion gets involved, the children die. If any of your other Pack friends help you fight, the children die.\u201d</p><p>I fired. My arrow pierced the wood of the chair a fraction of a second before Raphael\u2019s claws scoured it. The child and the god were gone.</p><p>CHAPTER 13</p><p>The office phone was dead.</p><p>Roman took off \u201cto gather supplies.\u201d</p><p>Anapa said the shapeshifters couldn\u2019t help us fight. He said nothing about us telling the Pack what was going on. The Jackals had to be warned. I shifted shape, and Raphael and I ran into the night.</p><p>We cut through the decrepit industrial district, moving at the shapeshifter equivalent of a canter. Ruins streamed by us, dark, inky black, like haunted wrecks of ancient ships. Gutted warehouses with steel beams thrusting out, vehicle shells, treacherous caves of concrete hiding hungry things with glowing eyes, born of magic and hungry for a burst of hot blood on their tongues. The beasts looked but didn\u2019t venture close. They recognized us for what we were\u2014predators, built to hunt, kill, and devour\u2014and right now neither of us was in the mood to be merciful.</p><p>The city ended and we ran along the crumbling highway. Here nature revolted, fueled by magic, and trees had grown with shocking speed, crowding the old road. We kept going, tireless, eating the miles like they were delicious bites. Wolves didn\u2019t have a monopoly on marathon chases. We were hyenas. We could run forever.</p><p>Raphael moved next to me, so graceful, so lethal, full of fierce beauty. It felt so right, running like this, guarding each other\u2019s flank. Together we were a tiny pack...a mated couple. Should any threat cross our path, we\u2019d rip into it together. I had forgotten what it felt like.</p><p>The road brought us to a group of three oaks. Here a narrow trail branched from the main highway, barely wide enough for a single vehicle to pass. Blink and you would miss it. We turned onto it in unison.</p><p>The path curled and twisted, veering through the woods.</p><p>A wolf howl rose in the distance\u2014a pure, beautiful note soaring to the clear skies. Another answered. The Keep sentries announcing our approach. A deep-voiced whoop followed, a warning and a declaration of ownership in one\u2014a bouda must\u2019ve been on duty tonight.</p><p>We burst out of the woods into a clearing. A massive structure towered before us, the solid, impenetrable mass of stone shaped into a semblance of a fortified castle or castlelike fort. It was the ultimate den, wrapped into a wall of gray stone, with towers, defenses, a vast underground, and a myriad of hidden passageways and escape routes. A testament to Curran\u2019s paranoia. Even if the Keep were besieged, even if the siege was lost, the Pack would melt into the woods to reunite and fight another day.</p><p>We cleared the courtyard and kept running, through the door, through the narrow hallway, up a dozen of stair flights all the way to the top of the tower, to the floor just below Curran\u2019s private quarters. The guard recognized us and stepped out of the way. Raphael was the male bouda alpha. He sat on the Council with Aunt B. Nobody would stop him.</p><p>We rushed into the spacious room Curran called his office. The Beast Lord was sitting behind his desk, looking at some papers. Kate sat on the couch with a tortured look on her face, holding a copy of the book of Pack law and making notes in a notebook.</p><p>They looked up in unison.</p><p>\u201cClan Jackal is in danger,\u201d I said.</p><p>We sat in a conference room, both still in our fur, with the Beast Lord, Kate, Jim, and Colin and Geraldine Mather, the Jackal alphas. Colin, a muscular, beefy man with a wrestler\u2019s build and pale hair, leaned on the table, his face flat and unreadable. His mate and wife sat next to him. Where Colin was fair, Geraldine was dark, her skin a deep brown, her hair black, her body honed to muscular efficiency by constant training.</p><p>\u201cHer name is Brandy Kerry,\u201d Geraldine said. \u201cShe is seven years old. Her parents are on a business trip to Charlotte. They left her here in the Keep in the boarding school in the south wing. She took a nap at five o\u2019clock with the rest of the children in her class. The room is on the seventh floor. The windows are barred. Ruth, the teaching aide, sat by the door, reading a book. At the end of the hour, she came in to wake the children and found Brandy\u2019s bed empty. Ruth searched the room. None of the other seven kids saw anything. Brandy just evaporated from her bed and nobody had noticed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe rest of the staff searched the floor,\u201d Colin continued. \u201cEvery room was checked, and to get to the staircase, she would\u2019ve had to go past the school receptionist and a guard, and Connie swore she did not see a child leave. When it became evident that Brandy wasn\u2019t anywhere on the school floor, we were alerted to the situation.\u201d</p><p>Of all the clans, Jackals were the most paranoid when it came to their children. Where boudas spoiled their kids with too much freedom and cats encouraged offspring to go on solitary wanderings, the jackals always stressed family. In the wild, unlike wolves who formed packs or rats who swarmed, jackals mated for life and lived in pairs, raising their children on their own little slices of territory.</p><p>\u201cI yelled at Ruth.\u201d Geraldine clenched her hand into a fist. \u201cI thought she walked off or fell asleep, and Brandy had snuck out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe checked the bars on the window and did a complete sweep of the wing and the outside,\u201d Colin said. \u201cNo sign of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe took that baby.\u201d A snarl slipped into Geraldine\u2019s voice. \u201cHe plucked her right out of her bed, that fucking bastard. I will tear his guts out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you confront him, he\u2019ll kill you and her,\u201d Kate said.</p><p>Geraldine whirled to her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not an insult,\u201d Curran said. \u201cShe\u2019s stating a fact. He has power over jackals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what do we do?\u201d Geraldine raised her hands.</p><p>\u201cWe do nothing,\u201d Curran said.</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe do nothing,\u201d he repeated. \u201cWe don\u2019t know where he\u2019s keeping the child, but he won\u2019t hesitate to kill her. We will meet his demands. For now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wants Andrea and I to help him,\u201d Raphael said. \u201cWe will do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve discussed it,\u201d I said. \u201cAs long as we play ball, no more children will be taken.\u201d</p><p>Colin\u2019s voice turned into a rough growl. \u201cSo you want us to sit on our hands, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Kate said. \u201cFind out everything you can on him. Go to the books, visit experts, get as much information as you can on him. Find out his weaknesses, if he has any. As soon as the moment presents itself, we will hit him with everything we have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve killed wannabe gods before,\u201d Curran said. \u201cHell, we could probably kill him now. But I will not do it at the cost of a child\u2019s life. We must be patient and smart. Bring your people into the Keep. The fewer isolated targets the better. Raise the alert. Nobody goes anywhere except in groups of three. Sleep in shifts, with the guards watching over the children.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI will reinforce the wards on the south wing again,\u201d Kate said. \u201cIt won\u2019t stop him, but it may make it harder for him.\u201d</p><p>The alpha Jackals looked like they wanted to tear their hair out.</p><p>\u201cPatience,\u201d Curran said. \u201cWe can\u2019t pull that chain, because there is a child attached to the other end of it. We\u2019ll stalk him like a deer, with all the cunning and calculation we have. Jackals have a reputation as scavengers, but all of us know better. All of us here have seen Clan Jackal families bring down deer and moose. There is honor in taking prey much larger than yourself, especially if that prey is smart and difficult to trap.\u201d</p> <p>There was a reason why Curran was the Beast Lord.</p><p>\u201cHe may be a god,\u201d Curran continued, \u201cbut he\u2019s in our world now and he\u2019s alone. Together we\u2019re smarter, more cunning, and more vicious. Patience.\u201d</p><p>The Jackals switched from agitation to a terrifying steely determination. \u201cPatience,\u201d Geraldine repeated, as if tasting it on her tongue to get the full meaning of the word.</p><p>Colin nodded. \u201cAJ is a professor of cultural anthropology. He may know an expert.\u201d</p><p>Five minutes later they had come up with six names and left.</p> <p>\u201cIt won\u2019t hold them for long,\u201d Jim said, a few moments after the door closed behind them. \u201cWhen the parents return, they will whip the clan into a frenzy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we need to resolve it before the parents return.\u201d Curran looked at Raphael and me. \u201cWhat do you need?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA deer,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d Jim said.</p><p>\u201cHe said that Kate would know where the shield was and to tell her to bring another deer,\u201d Raphael elaborated.</p><p>Curran looked at his mate. Something passed between them, some sort of wordless conversation only they understood.</p> <p>\u201cHell no,\u201d Curran said.</p><p>\u201cThey can\u2019t summon it by themselves and you can\u2019t get involved,\u201d Kate said.</p><p>Curran\u2019s eyes turned into molten gold. \u201cAre you out of your mind? It took you, me, and five vampires and we barely got away. He has your scent now. Nobody goes to see him twice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNobody except me.\u201d She gave him her psycho look.</p><p>The Beast Lord clenched his jaw.</p><p>Kate smiled at him.</p><p>The tension was so thick you could cut it into slices and serve it on toast. Of all control freaks, Curran was the worst and he existed convinced that Kate was made of fragile glass. I understood it. I completely understood. He was in exactly the same place I had been a couple of hours before: watching someone you love dive headfirst into danger and not being able to do a damn thing about it. It was difficult to watch and harder to live through.</p><p>\u201cThere are hard battles and there is suicide,\u201d Curran said.</p> <p>\u201cAgreed. I have a plan,\u201d Kate said.</p><p>Curran raised his hands, inviting the miraculous plan to come forth.</p><p>\u201cThe volhv serves Chernobog, who presides over the dead and fallen in battle. This is his area of expertise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to be in on this discussion,\u201d Raphael said.</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d I added.</p><p>\u201cThe shield belongs to a draugr,\u201d Curran said. \u201cIt\u2019s an undead, unkillable giant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow unkillable?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cWe couldn\u2019t kill it,\u201d Kate said.</p><p>\u201cBoth of you at the same time?\u201d Raphael asked.</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>Great.</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t be trying to kill him,\u201d Kate said. \u201cHe\u2019s confined by wards, but once we take his shield and carry it past the ward line, the protective spells may fail. We can\u2019t let him rampage around, because he eats people. That\u2019s where the volhv comes in. Roman will have to rebind the draugr.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan he even do this?\u201d Curran asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, we\u2019ll have to ask him,\u201d Kate said.</p><p>There was more planning and discussing and talking, and at the end of it, I was so tired, I couldn\u2019t see straight. The draugr was really bad news. I said that we needed extra firepower, the kind that would work during magic.</p><p>\u201cGalahad warheads,\u201d I told them. Strictly speaking it wasn\u2019t a warhead, but rather an arrowhead that fit into a custom crossbow and carried a magic charge that would take down an elephant or a giant, for whom it was invented in Wales. In my time with the Order I had managed to order two cases of them from the UK. I even had the new bow to go with them.</p><p>Shortly after that, Barabas dragged Raphael off to talk about some sort of important thing that couldn\u2019t wait. Kate led me to a room that had a bed, and I collapsed into it, fur and all. The Pack bed was so soft. Like floating on a cloud.</p><p>Fatigue weighed me down. I closed my eyes, feeling the ache humming through my legs. Shouldn\u2019t have sat down...yawn...straight after running...yawn. Should\u2019ve walked it off...first...</p><p>I stood in the water. It splashed past my ankles, dark blue-green and warm. Soft mud squished beneath my feet. I made fists with my toes and watched a bright green cloud of powdery silt rise from the river\u2019s bottom, swirling around my legs. Patches of reeds grew, stretching into the river, bending lightly in the wind, as though they were whispering gossip to each other. In the distance, across the vast expanse of water, the sun was setting or rising, a small ball of yellow hovering at the edge of low dark hills, the silver-nacre sky around it painted with pink and yellow.</p><p>I looked over my shoulder. A yellow shore greeted me, touched with patches of bright green grass, and beyond it palms stretched upward.</p><p>We were definitely not in Kansas anymore.</p><p>A slender bird walked past me on long legs. It had a curved neck and a long beak and I realized it was a heron.</p><p>A presence brushed against me, saturated with magic. I turned. A jackal the size of a rhino waded into the river downstream from me and lapped the water, watching me with golden eyes.</p><p>Right. I was standing in the Nile, watching Anapa, and this was not an ordinary dream. There were rules to this dream. No promises, no striking of bargains, in fact, no talking. Nobody yet had managed to get into a shitty bargain with a god by keeping their mouth shut.</p><p>\u201cBeautiful, isn\u2019t it?\u201d The Jackal-Anapa raised his head and looked into the distance, at the sun. \u201cDo you like the way it smells?\u201d</p><p>It smelled verdant. It smelled like the moisture of the river mixing with the fragrance of dry grasses from the shore, and flowers, and fish, and rich mud. It smelled like the sort of place where life would flourish and hunting would be plentiful.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your father\u2019s blood. It calls to you,\u201d the Jackal said.</p><p>Bullshit. My father was an animal.</p><p>\u201cAnimals miss their home, too.\u201d</p><p>Right. He was in my head. No thinking, then.</p><p>\u201cDo you know why others fear you? They call you beastkin, they try to kill you? It is because of this. Of beastly memories you carry in your blood. The Firsts, the pack leaders of your kind, were made in much the same way as you. When primitive man prayed, he prayed for strength. His life was ruled by forces beyond his control: lightning, rain, wind, sun, and things with teeth that sought to eat him in the night. So the primitive man resorted to begging. He prayed to the predators, to those stronger than he, and sometimes, very, very rarely, his prayers were answered and a boon was granted. The Firsts, they are a perfect mix of human and animal. You are not, and thus you do not have the Firsts\u2019 strength or control, but you share in their memories. You see the world through your mother\u2019s eyes and through your father\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see it through my own eyes.\u201d Drat. Shouldn\u2019t have said anything. I clamped my mouth shut.</p><p>The Jackal chuckled.</p><p>The sun had set behind the hills. Dusk claimed the river. Gloom wove its way through the palms. Faint tendrils of steam escaped the river, still warmer than bathwater.</p><p>\u201cI want your body,\u201d Anapa said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s flattering, but no.\u201d I couldn\u2019t help it, it just burst out.</p><p>\u201cNot in a sexual way, you foolish child. The body I wear in the world is a part of my bloodline. But he is weak. Its magic reserves are meager. Make no mistake, if Apep is resurrected, the assistance I can offer you will be limited at best. Your body is strong. Your blood is rooted in the same place as mine. We\u2019re both a mix of beast and man. You\u2019re a more suitable host than any of the other shapeshifters I have encountered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a hyena. You\u2019re a jackal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will make do,\u201d Anapa said.</p><p>\u201cAnd what happens to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will merge with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lying.\u201d I knew it. I felt it in my gut.</p><p>The Jackal lapped the river. \u201cPerhaps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I throw my life away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I am a god and I asked for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are not my god.\u201d</p><p>The Jackal sighed. \u201cThat is the trouble with this age. There was a time when thousands would slit their own throats for my sake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. There was never that time.\u201d</p><p>The Jackal bared his teeth. \u201cWhat do you know, whelp?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know human nature. We might sacrifice a few, because we are stupid and hardwired for group survival. But we would never die in the thousands because a god wished it. Those kinds of numbers require material gains, like power, wealth, territory.\u201d</p><p>The Jackal stared at me. \u201cGive me your body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere may come a time when you will say yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t hold your breath.\u201d</p><p>The Jackal laughed softly. \u201cLook over there.\u201d</p><p>I glanced up and saw a man. He stood in the river, nude, with the waters lapping at his thighs. The last rays of the setting sun colored his side, throwing orange highlights on his skin, tracing every contour of the etched muscle. He looked so...perfect. Except his face was a blur.</p><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d</p><p>The man\u2019s body arched up, his back bending back at an unnatural angle, the ridges of the stomach muscles stretching and his face came into focus. Raphael.</p><p>A figure rose above him, an eight-foot-tall man with the head of a jackal. He raised his hand, a golden staff in it, and passed it over the body. The skin over the Raphael\u2019s chest and abdomen split. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I gasped. No!</p><p>Blood fountained, coloring the waters of the Nile. Raphael\u2019s muscles opened like bloody petals. Anubis held his hand with outstretched fingers and a human heart, steaming hot and drenched in blood, tore itself out of my mate\u2019s chest and landed in the god\u2019s clawed fingers.</p><p>My own heart skipped a beat.</p> <p>Anubis waded through the water toward me, the heart still beating. I tried to back away, but my feet sank into soft mud.</p><p>The god bent over me and offered me the heart. It was terrible. Dread pulsed from it in waves. Dread, sorrow, and guilt. It was choking me.</p><p>\u201cTake it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bastard! I\u2019ll tear you apart!\u201d</p><p>Anubis raised the heart, holding the bloody organ just inches from my face and let it go. It hung in the air, terrible, bleeding drop by drop into the Nile.</p> <p>The river faded. When I awoke, the faint rays of the sunrise, weak and transparent, sifted into the room through my window. I had slept for barely an hour.</p><p>I smelled a familiar scent and turned my head. At the other end of the room, near the wall, wrapped in a blanket, with his pillow resting on the floor, lay Raphael. He was back in his human form, and his dark hair fanned across the pillow, his profile perfect against the pale fabric.</p><p>He must\u2019ve let me have the bed, because in our beast forms both of us wouldn\u2019t have fit on it.</p><p>I looked down and saw myself on the sheets. I had turned human during the night. Olive mud streaks marked my ankles in two smudged rings.</p><p>Fear curled in the pit of my stomach, scratching at my insides with icy claws. I wanted to crawl out of my bed, tiptoe across the room, and slide under the blanket with him. He would put his arm around me, and I would lay safe, wrapped in him, breathing in his scent. It would be only an illusion of safety, but I wanted it so, so badly.</p><p>I didn\u2019t want to die. I didn\u2019t want to give my body to any gods. For the first time in my twenty-eight years I was truly living. I wanted to love and to be loved in return. I wanted happiness, and family, and children. I wanted a long life and I wanted Raphael to live it with me. I was terrified that I would fail and little Brandy would pay for my mistakes. Fear gripped me, making it hard to breathe.</p> <p>I couldn\u2019t tell Raphael. He would throw his life away to save me.</p><p>I was so scared, and I lay there paralyzed, unable to think of anything but Raphael\u2019s heart dripping blood into the Nile.</p><p>I crawled out of bed, wrapped my sheet around me, walked across the floor, and crouched by him. \u201cRaphael. Raphael...Wake up.\u201d</p><p>His eyes opened, so blue. He reached out and pulled me down next to him, curving his body around mine.</p><p>\u201cRaphael...\u201d</p><p>He pulled me closer.</p><p>The heat radiating from his chest burned my back. \u201cRaphael...\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust lay with me,\u201d he said.</p> <p>I shut up, stretched against him, trying to banish the gaping hole inside my chest. We didn\u2019t have much time. We didn\u2019t have any time at all. I cradled that knot of pain and he pulled me close.</p><p>If Anapa could invade my dreams and steal children out of the Keep, there was no telling what else he could do. I had to be careful, because Raphael could die. He could die tonight, tomorrow, the next day, all because a god wanted my body. I had to keep him alive. I would do anything. I would give anything to keep him breathing.</p><p>He kissed my neck. It sent an electric shiver down my spine.</p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d he said.</p><p>I curled into a tiny ball.</p><p>He pulled me closer, wrapping his arms around me. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wanted to know why I didn\u2019t call you while I was in the Order,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is. When I woke up after Erra burned, my advocate was there. He took me to my apartment and there were two knights with him. They waited outside. Inside he told me that anyone I contacted while in the Order\u2019s custody would come under scrutiny. They would listen in on my calls. Kate has a secret. She trusted me with it and I had an obligation to keep it hidden. I realized then that I had to stay away from her. If she said the wrong thing or, worse, decided to track me down and rescue me, the Order would dig up her past. I couldn\u2019t speak to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand Kate.\u201d He kissed me again. \u201cBut why didn\u2019t you call me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I was scared,\u201d I whispered. \u201cMy only friend was out of the picture, my mother couldn\u2019t help me, and I was all alone. You were all I had left. I was afraid that I would call you and you\u2019d tell me we were done. They put a phone in my room so the temptation to call would be always there. So now you know my dirty secret. I\u2019m a coward.\u201d</p><p>Raphael turned me over and looked at me, his face close to mine. \u201cYou and I will never be done. You\u2019re my mate.\u201d</p><p>He kissed the corner of my mouth. I almost cried.</p><p>\u201cI stopped sleeping since you left,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll sleep for a couple of hours, wake up, you\u2019re not there.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes.</p><p>\u201cI need an answer, Andrea,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAn answer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMate. Yes or no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you need to ask?\u201d I whispered. \u201cYou\u2019re my mate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you choose to leave, I will go with you,\u201d he said.</p><p>I opened my eyes.</p><p>\u201cUnless you\u2019re just itching to take Curran on,\u201d he said. \u201cI suppose we could fight him. We\u2019d lose, but it would be fun while it lasted.\u201d</p><p>Silly bouda. I hugged him, sliding under him, the weight of his muscular body a reassuring pressure on me. His eyes were so blue. I kissed him, letting his taste wash over my tongue. Every muscle in me shivered in anticipation. \u201cA smelly, stupid bouda once told me that if you make your mate choose between you and his family, you\u2019re not worthy of his loyalty. I wouldn\u2019t do it to you, Raphael. I love you.\u201d</p><p>He licked me, nipping on my lower lip. He caressed me. His hand slipped down, stroking, pushing my thighs open. His scent washed over me, and for once, instead of making me hurt in regret, it sang through me. \u201cMate...\u201d</p><p>I wrapped my legs around him and whispered, \u201cMake love to me.\u201d</p><p>When I awoke, three hours later, Raphael was gone. The mud from my ankles proved remarkably difficult to remove. It took multiple soapings and scrubbings with a washcloth and even a pumice stone, until finally it was all gone and the skin on my legs was bright red. The Lyc-V would fix it in no time at all, but it aggravated me to no end.</p><p>I stalked out into the hallway and smelled English muffins. Crisp, just-out-of-the-toaster, generously buttered English muffins. The aroma grabbed my nose and dragged me down the hall, to a side room, where Kate sat at a long table, drinking coffee. Plates covered the table: heaps of scrambled eggs; hot, crispy hash browns; soft crepes, folded into quarters and drenched with melted butter; bacon, sausage, ham, English muffins.</p><p>\u201cFood!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Kate thrust a plate in my direction.</p><p>I loaded my plate, and bit into the ham. Yum, yum, yum. Meat. Meat good. Andrea hungry. Andrea had spent too many calories in the past forty-eight hours. I could do without sleep or food, but not both.</p><p>\u201cHave you seen my mate?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s with his mother.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes.</p><p>\u201cHe was in here about half an hour ago, eating up a storm. Aunt B has graced us with her presence and she wanted him to explain things to her.\u201d</p><p>I ate the English muffin and got another. I could almost feel the energy flooding my body. As a shapeshifter, I could technically go without sleep completely, if I had to, but food was a requirement. I was going to stuff myself until I resembled one of those pigs they served at banquets in old movies.</p><p>\u201cYour favorite volhv showed up half an hour ago, complaining about his lack of sleep and stupid gods. He says he brought his Batman belt.\u201d</p><p>I stopped chewing for a second and caught my reflection in the shiny kettle. I looked like a chipmunk with my cheeks full of food. \u201cSo can he bind this draugr?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe says so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat means we\u2019re still on?\u201d</p><p>Kate nodded.</p><p>Well. My day was finally looking up. About time.</p><p>CHAPTER 14</p><p>The horses clopped down the dirt path. According to Kate the creature that had our scale-shield lived deep in the lands of Norse Heritage. The neo-Viking territory. The neo-Vikings didn\u2019t care for technology within their borders.</p><p>Unlike several other Scandinavian organizations, the Norse Heritage wasn\u2019t interested in the preservation of Scandinavian culture. They were interested in perpetuating the Viking myth: they wore furs, braided their hair, waved around oversized weapons, started fights with wild abandon, and generally acted in a manner appropriate to people embracing the spirit of a pirating and pillaging barbarian horde. They took in anyone and everyone, regardless of ancestry and criminal history, as long as they demonstrated the \u201cViking spirit,\u201d which apparently amounted to liking violent brawls and drinking lots and lots of beer.</p><p>The Norse Heritage Hall was located a good way out of the city. Our small band clopped its way down the road, Kate and I up front, Ascanio driving a wagon with a bound deer on it, and Raphael and Roman bringing up the rear. The two men carried on a quiet conversation, which sounded surprisingly civil.</p><p>I patted my horse\u2019s neck. Her name was Sugar and she had come from the Keep stables. She was a Tennessee Walker, smart and calm, with high endurance. I liked her color too\u2014she was a red roan of such a pale gentle shade, she almost looked pink.</p><p>Kate smirked.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour horse looks pink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you paste some stars on her butt, you\u2019ll be riding My Little Pony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBugger off.\u201d I patted the mare\u2019s neck. \u201cDon\u2019t listen to her, Sugar. You are the cutest horsey ever. The correct name for her color is strawberry roan, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStrawberry shortcake, more like it. Does Strawberry Shortcake know you stole her horse? She will be berry, berry angry with you.\u201d</p><p>I looked at her from under half-lowered eyelids. \u201cI can shoot you right here, on this road, and nobody will ever find your body.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Behind us Ascanio chortled.</p><p>The road curved, caught between dense, dark forest on the left and an open, low, grass-sheathed hill on the right. Outcroppings of pale rock marked the hills. Norse Heritage Hall sat on the west side of Gainesville, about fifty miles northeast of Atlanta. The massive spread of the Chattahoochee Forest had long ago swallowed Gainesville, turning it into an isolated town, like a small island in a sea of trees.</p><p>Kate was riding a dark, nasty-looking gray roan that looked like it couldn\u2019t wait to stomp something to death.</p> <p>\u201cSo, do you miss Marygold?\u201d</p><p>Marygold used to be her Order mule.</p><p>\u201cMy aunt killed her,\u201d Kate said.</p><p>Crap. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d She had really loved that mule.</p><p>Ahead, the top of the largest rock pile shifted. A thick humanoid body pushed from the crest. Its head was wide and equipped with dinosaur jaws armed with narrow teeth. Gray scales shielded its body, protruding from the flesh as if the creature had rolled in gravel. Long strands of emerald-green moss dripped from its back and shoulders. The sun tore through the clouds. A stray ray caught the creature\u2019s side and the beast sparkled as if dipped in diamond dust.</p> <p>\u201cWhat the hell is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a landv\u00e6ttir,\u201d Kate said. \u201cThey\u2019re land spirits that pop up around neo-Norse settlements. He won\u2019t bother us unless we turn off the path.\u201d</p><p>We rode past the creature.</p><p>Raphael urged his horse forward and rode up between the two of us. \u201cAnapa. Powerful enough to snatch a child from the Keep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d I murmured.</p><p>\u201cAnd this is really important to him?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t he do it himself?\u201d Raphael grimaced. \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t he help us? Why keep the Pack out of it?\u201d</p><p>I had asked myself these same questions before, so I told him the only answer I could come up with. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at Kate. She shrugged. \u201cBeats me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked your volhv,\u201d Raphael said to me.</p><p>My volhv, huh? \u201cAnd what did the Russian sugar bear tell you?\u201d</p><p>Kate made a strangled noise. Raphael clenched his jaw, then unclenched it.</p><p>\u201cHe said that Anapa is a god and gods are weird. What kind of a demented answer is that? Isn\u2019t he supposed to be some sort of expert on this whole thing, which is why we\u2019re bringing him along?\u201d</p> <p>Gods are vicious, selfish assholes. I shrugged. \u201cRoman is an expert and he gave you his expert opinion. Gods are weird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can hear you,\u201d Roman called from behind us. \u201cI\u2019m not deaf.\u201d</p><p>Raphael shook his head and dropped back.</p><p>Anapa wasn\u2019t just weird. No, he had a plan. And all his good humor and funny smiles were calculated. They masked his true essence the way soft fur covered a cat\u2019s claws. And I would keep his plan to myself. If I told Raphael, he would do something rash to save me. If I told it to Kate, she would worry and try to fix it. There was no way to fix it. It was what it was.</p><p>The road turned, forking into two paths ahead. The larger road, marked by an old birch, curved up the hill. The smaller, less traveled path veered right, into some woods.</p><p>A man walked out from behind the tree and barred the path. Six and a half feet tall and hulking, he resembled a man-sized tank draped in chain mail. He wore a dramatic cloak of black fur and a polished war helm and carried an enormous single axe on a long wooden handle.</p><p>\u201cGood to see you again, Gunnar,\u201d Kate said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to the glade.\u201d</p><p>The bottom half of Gunnar\u2019s face paled. \u201cAgain?\u201d</p><p>Kate nodded.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been once. You can\u2019t go again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got no choice.\u201d</p><p>Gunnar rubbed his face. \u201cHe\u2019s got your scent now. You know what happens to people who go to see him twice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I still have to go.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head and stepped aside. \u201cIt\u2019s been nice knowing you.\u201d</p><p>Kate touched the reins and our small procession rolled on.</p><p>\u201cWhat exactly happens to the people who go to see him twice?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cHe eats them,\u201d Kate said.</p><p>The old road narrowed, slicing its way into the forest. Tall trees crowded the road, as if protesting its intrusion in their midst. The air smelled of forest: pine sap, the earthy odor of moist soil, the faint harshness of bobcat mark somewhere to the left, and the slightly oily squirrel musk. A bluish fog hung between the trees, obscuring the ground. Spooky.</p><p>We came to a stone arch made by tall pillars of gray stone, bound together by vines.</p><p>Kate hopped off her horse. \u201cWe hoof it now. Raphael, will you take the deer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>I took the tripod framework out of the cart and pulled it apart into a mount, sighting the path past the pillars. I planted the tripod into the ground and took my huge crossbow off the cart. Dark letters ran along the stock of the bow: THUNDERHAWK.</p><p>\u201cThis is new,\u201d Kate said.</p><p>I snapped the crossbow into the top of the mount, took a canvas bundle from the cart, and unrolled it. Crossbow bolts, tipped with the Galahad warheads.</p><p>\u201cThis is my baby.\u201d I petted the stock.</p><p>\u201cYou have a strange relationship with your weapons,\u201d Roman said.</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea,\u201d Raphael told him.</p><p>\u201cThis from a man with a living staff and a man who once drove four hours both ways for a sword he then put on his wall,\u201d I murmured.</p><p>\u201cIt was an Angus Trim,\u201d Raphael said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a sharpened strip of metal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have an Angus Trim sword?\u201d Kate\u2019s eyes lit up.</p><p>\u201cBought it at an estate auction,\u201d Raphael said. \u201cIf we get out of this alive, you are invited to come to my house and play with it.\u201d</p><p>It was good that Curran wasn\u2019t here and I was secure in our relationship, because that totally could be taken the wrong way.</p><p>I grabbed my backpack. Raphael slung the deer over his shoulder. Kate pulled a leather bundle from the cart. It had a bead pattern along the side that looked very familiar. I\u2019d seen similar designs before on an Oklahoma Cherokee reservation\u2014it was Indian scrollwork.</p><p>\u201cIs that a Cherokee design?\u201d</p><p>Kate nodded. \u201cI bought this from the Cherokee medicine woman.\u201d</p><p>I motioned Ascanio over. \u201cAim like this.\u201d I swiveled the tripod, moving the bow. \u201cSight through here. To fire, flip this lever and squeeze the trigger. Slowly. Don\u2019t jerk it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven if he jerks it, he\u2019ll hit, trust me,\u201d Kate said. \u201cHe\u2019ll have a large target.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t listen to her, she can\u2019t shoot an elephant from ten feet away. She would bash him with her bow and then try to cut his throat with her sword.\u201d</p><p>Kate chuckled.</p><p>\u201cYour turn.\u201d I nodded at the bow.</p><p>\u201cAim, sight, flip lever, squeeze the trigger slowly,\u201d Ascanio said. \u201cTry not to panic and cry like a little girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood man.\u201d We followed Kate single file up the path, leaving him at the cart.</p><p>The forest grew grimmer, the trees growing darker, more twisted, still full of leaves but somehow dead, as if frozen in time. The fog thickened into soup. The usual scents faded. Not even squirrels ventured here, as if life itself was forbidden. These were some screwed-up woods.</p><p>I smelled carrion. Strong and recent, butter-sweet.</p><p>We came to a clearing\u2014a small stretch of mossy ground slightly larger than a basketball court, bordered by massive trees. In the center of the clearing rose a big stone, tall and flat like a table. A hollowed-out space had been carved into the stone and stained with red. I sniffed. Blood. Only a couple of days old.</p><p>\u201cThe deer goes on the rock,\u201d Kate said.</p><p>\u201cSo what brought you here the first time?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cA dying child,\u201d Kate said. \u201cIt was me, Curran, and some vampires. He and I were the only ones to get out in one piece. Still time to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave?\u201d Roman rubbed his hands together. \u201cAnd miss this? Are you fucking crazy?\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t swearing because he was freaked. He was swearing because he was excited. Wow. For once, I had no words.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure about this?\u201d Kate asked me.</p><p>I had the most important job in this awesome plan of ours. \u201cWill you get on with it already?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe will be fine,\u201d Raphael said. \u201cShe\u2019s the fastest.\u201d</p><p>To the left some creature screeched, loud and desperate. Another joined it. I fought a shiver.</p><p>\u201cThe draugr was once a Viking named H\u00e5kon from Vinland,\u201d Kate said. \u201cThe Vikings living there traded with local tribes, who told them that Cherokees were soft. They said that the Southern tribes were farmers, not warriors, and had a lot of gold. So H\u00e5kon sailed down on two ships to rape, plunder, and pillage. Except that the Cherokees had good arrows and strong magic. He died in the skirmish. Nobody stopped to bury him, and he was so pissed off by that, that he rose from the dead as a draugr, chased down his remaining men, and ate them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiterally?\u201d Roman asked.</p><p>Kate nodded. \u201cThe Cherokees found him gnawing on their bones. He was too powerful and they couldn\u2019t kill him, so they locked him on this hill with their wards to keep him from running loose.\u201d</p><p>The light gained an odd bluish tint. Somehow the forest had gotten darker.</p><p>\u201cThis is a bad place,\u201d the black volhv said. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be here. Well, I should. But you shouldn\u2019t. You see, my god holds dominion over dead things, but this creature belongs to a different pantheon, so I have some protection here, but not too much. Not enough to kill the draugr. Just enough to bind him and survive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing wonders for my confidence,\u201d I told him.</p><p>Kate put the bundle with the Cherokee beadwork on the ground, knelt by it, and untied its cord. Inside lay four sharpened sticks, each about three feet long. She picked the first one up, found a rock and pounded it into the ground by the beginning of the path. That was the way I\u2019d run when it came time to get the hell out of there. The second stick went to the left side of the clearing, the third to the right, and the final exactly opposite the first. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThese are our defenses. They will delay him a little bit. Don\u2019t fight him. Just run.\u201d</p><p>Kate got a pipe out of a box and began smoking it. The tobacco hit her and she coughed.</p><p>\u201cLightweight.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d She circled the clearing, waving her pipe around.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen this before,\u201d Roman said. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to witness Native American rituals these days. So much has been lost due to assimilation and lack of written records. Exciting stuff!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, so glad we could indulge your intellectual curiosity, Professor,\u201d Raphael told him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m probably making a hash job of it, but the tribe refuses to approach this hill, so I\u2019m all you\u2019ve got,\u201d Kate said.</p><p>She completed the circle, sat down, and started pulling things out of her bag: a plastic honey bear, a metal canteen, and a little bag.</p> <p>I blinked and the forest was full of eyes. Elongated, solid yellow, they peeked at us from under the boulders, from the darkness by the roots of the trees, from the branches...</p><p>I bared my teeth. \u201cWhat are these?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d Kate kept her voice low. \u201cThey came out last time, too. I think they might be uldra. Ghastek said they\u2019re nature spirits from Lapland. They didn\u2019t attack us the last time.\u201d</p><p>To my right, one of the uldra crawled up on the end of the fallen tree trunk, just feet away. An inch or two over a foot tall, it perched on the tree bark, gripping it with avian feet. Dense dark fur covered its humanoid body. Its face vaguely resembled a baboon.</p><p>The uldra found its spot, moving with slothlike slowness, and froze, oversized hands with long, large-knuckled fingers folded in front of it. Its mouth gaped open, displaying a forest of long, deep-water fish teeth.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just some small nechist,\u201d Roman said next to me.</p> <p>\u201cNechist?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cYes. Unclean thing. They\u2019re harmless.\u201d He dug in his bag. \u201cHang on...Here.\u201d Roman pulled out a small pack of crackers and shook one out. \u201cHere, you want a cracker?\u201d He offered the cracker to the creature.</p><p>\u201cRoman...\u201d A warning crept into my voice. Those teeth didn\u2019t look good.</p><p>\u201cNo worries,\u201d he told me. \u201cHere.\u201d He clicked his tongue. \u201cCome get a cracker.\u201d</p><p>The uldra\u2019s pale eyes focused on the cracker. Slowly it reached for it and plucked the small square from Roman\u2019s fingers. The uldra took a bite.</p><p>\u201cGood, huh?\u201d Roman clicked his tongue some more. \u201cCome on. Come.\u201d</p><p>The uldra crawled onto his forearm and climbed up the black sleeve to sit on his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d Raphael said.</p> <p>Roman made smoochy lips at the uldra. \u201cWho\u2019s so good? Want another cracker?\u201d</p><p>A second uldra made its way out of the bushes and sat by Roman\u2019s boot, funky arms folded, waiting for a handout. Roman tossed another cracker on the ground. A couple of smaller creatures trudged over and tugged on the hem of his robe.</p><p>\u201cThere are plenty of crackers for everyone,\u201d Roman reassured them.</p><p>Raphael leaned forward. The uldra bared their teeth. He growled at them.</p><p>\u201cNo need to bully them.\u201d Roman petted the nearest beastie.</p><p>The first uldra finished its meal and rubbed its head against Roman\u2019s cheek.</p><p>A low unearthly moan came from the trees. The uldra fled. One second they were there and then whoosh, only half-eaten crackers were left.</p><p>\u201cHere we go.\u201d Kate walked up to the stone and the sedated deer lying on it.</p><p>The plan was simple. Once the draugr showed up and we obtained the scale, I would take off. Normally I would only have to make it to the stone pillars, which marked the beginning of the Cherokee defenses. But Kate was worried that carrying the scale past the pillars meant we\u2019d be moving a piece of the creature\u2019s stash behind the ward line, which may or may not cancel the spells. We had to stop it at those pillars.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you can bind it?\u201d I asked Roman.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve got this.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, I was really worried.</p><p>Kate opened the pouch, took out rune stones\u2014small squares of worn bone, each with a rune etched on it in black\u2014and tossed them into the basin. They scattered and clinked on the stone, like dice in a plastic cup. She emptied the canteen onto the runes, and I smelled hops and barley. Beer. Kate squeezed the honey bear, squirting a stream of amber-colored honey onto the runes.</p><p>Roman leaned toward me. \u201cThose are Norse runes.\u201d</p><p>I looked at him.</p><p>\u201cNot Slavic ones,\u201d Roman said. \u201cJust thought I\u2019d point it out.\u201d</p><p>He looked like he could barely contain all of the excitement.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d Kate said.</p><p>I took a deep breath, grabbed the deer by the head, and pulled his throat toward the hollowed out receptacle in the rock. The deer gave me a panicked look. \u201cSorry, boy.\u201d Kate raised her knife and cut its throat. The deer kicked, but I clamped it down. The scent of blood, hot and fresh, washed over me, kicking my senses into high gear.</p><p>Kate shook the runes, holding them loosely in her hand, and I saw tiny bursts of lightning between her fingers.</p><p>\u201cI call you out, H\u00e5kon. Come from your grave. Come taste the blood ale.\u201d</p><p>A sibilant sound came, made of old bones crunching underfoot, leathery mummified muscles creaking, and eerie evil whisper. I smelled the sickening stench of decomposition, the earth, the dust, and the liquefying flesh, as if someone had thrust my head into a grave. Magic washed over us, dragging freezing cold in its wake. Frost slicked the ground by my feet.</p><p>Out from beyond the clearing, the mist streamed at us, thickening as it came. It moaned, like a living thing, its voice full of torment, flowed into a manlike shape, and faded, leaving a thing in its wake.</p><p>Six feet tall, it was made of dried gristle and that particular, leathery flesh one usually saw on vampires, except his was tinted with blue-gray. Not a cell of fat could be found on its sparse frame. It wore chain mail and metal pauldrons, and neither fit him well\u2014they hung off him, slightly askew, obviously made for a much thicker body. The draugr raised his head and looked at me. Its face could\u2019ve been used as an anatomy model\u2014each muscle in it so clearly drawn under the thin layer of skin, it looked revoltingly alien. Its cold eyes stared at me, pupil-less and flat.</p><p>The undead lowered its head and started licking the blood and beer mixture.</p><p>Nausea jerked my stomach. There was something so wrong about this unnatural undead thing sucking up the blood of a creature that had been alive a few moments ago.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re done for now,\u201d Kate said.</p><p>The undead raised his head, its face bloody. His mouth moved, and I saw the leathery cords of his facial muscles slide and contract. Ugh.</p><p>Its voice was chilling, hoarse, and ancient. \u201cI know you. I know your scent.\u201d</p><p>Kate stared it straight in his face. \u201cI brought you blood ale for a boon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFoolish meat. Foolish, foolish meat.\u201d</p><p>The draugr went down for the ale.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Kate snapped.</p><p>The draugr leaned on the stone. \u201cI\u2019m H\u00e5kon, son of a jarl, scourge of the seas, devourer of flesh. What is it you want, meager meat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to see your shield,\u201d Kate said.</p><p>The draugr turned his head. \u201cMy shield?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe shield you bore when you sailed here from Vinland to take the gold from the Southern Tribes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe skr\u00e6lingar,\u201d the draugr said.</p><p>\u201cYes. The skr\u00e6lingar. You took two ships and came looking for it, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember...\u201d The draugr\u2019s voice carried. \u201cI remember everything. Birds with wings that covered half the sky. I remember skr\u00e6lingar magic. I remember the arrow in my back. I remember my corpse left to rot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you remember your shield?\u201d Kate insisted.</p><p>The draugr dipped his head toward the ale.</p><p>Kate clenched the runes. \u201cIf you want the ale, you will let me see your shield.\u201d</p><p>An evil cold fire flared in the draugr\u2019s eyes and dripped from his face in burning tears. \u201cI will devour you. I will lick your bones clean and crush them between my teeth. I will suck the marrow...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s nice,\u201d Kate said. \u201cThe shield.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, meat. Here it is.\u201d</p><p>The earth by the stone bulged upward, split, belching roots and smaller rocks. A curved wooden edge emerged, rising higher and higher, until the entire round shield broke free of the ground. In the middle of it sat an oblong, ridged yellow scale, pinned to the wood by metal bars. It was two feet long.</p><p>Two feet. What kind of snake had two-foot-long scales?</p><p>\u201cHere is my shield, meat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you remember how I came to you with an honest bargain last time and you broke it?\u201d Kate asked.</p><p>The draugr laughed. It was a cold, hollow sound.</p><p>\u201cTurnabout is fair play,\u201d Kate said.</p><p>I grabbed the shield and ran.</p><p>The draugr howled, shaking the forest. Roman\u2019s voice barked something in Russian. Raphael snarled.</p><p>Mist chased me, snaking its way down the mountain, trying to catch my ankles. I flew down the path.</p><p>Magic punched my back. I flew a few feet, hit the ground in a tight ball, rolled to my feet, and kept running. Just aftershocks. Kate must\u2019ve used a power word, her own special brand of magic. It nearly wiped her out\u2014they were her last resort.</p><p>You won\u2019t escape me, an icy voice whispered in my ear. Run all you want, meat. Run faster.</p><p>Every hair on my body stood on end.</p><p>I leaped over a root. The mist snapped like a whip and wound around my neck in a noose. It jerked me off my feet. I flew back, clawing at the tentacle of magic with one hand, clenching the shield with my right. I hit the ground on my back and the magic pulled me, scraping my skin over the roots.</p><p>Oh no, you don\u2019t. I growled and grabbed a branch with my left hand.</p><p>The magic yanked me backward, crushing my throat. Black circles swam before my eyes.</p><p>I planted my feet and forced myself up. Every muscle in my body strained. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The magic pulled.</p><p>I pushed forward. Step. Another step. No asshole undead would drag me back. No. Not happening.</p><p>The magic tore.</p> <p>I pitched forward and rolled, head over feet, curving my body around the shield, hitting every obstacle with soft parts of me, as if someone had stuck me into a dryer with a bag of rocks.</p><p>I crashed into a tree. The world swam a bit. I scrambled up. The shield lay in shambles at my feet, all except for the scale, which didn\u2019t have a scratch on it.</p><p>A dark icy shadow fell on the trees next to me.</p><p>I grabbed the scale and spun around. Something white was falling, so I thrust the scale up in front of it and crouched underneath.</p><p>Foot-long spikes of ice sank into the ground around me, hammering the scale. I held the scale until the impacts stopped and dashed down the slope. Magic exploded all around me in cold bursts, rattling the teeth in my skull. The harsh stench of rot filled my mouth. Around me the trees groaned, as if pulled upright by an invisible hand. My throat burned.</p> <p>I shot out onto the road.</p><p>The stone pillars loomed far in the distance to my right. I sprinted to them. My ribs were screaming in pain.</p><p>The trees creaked behind me. The draugr had made it onto the road.</p><p>My feet barely touched the ground. The draugr\u2019s magic iced my back.</p><p>Something whistled through the air and a body hit the road in front of me, hurled by a supernatural force. Roman. The volhv wasn\u2019t moving. I guess the binding didn\u2019t work after all.</p><p>Between the pillars Ascanio swiveled the crossbow on the tripod, squeezed the trigger, and fired. The oversized bolt sliced through the air above me. Thank you, kid.</p> <p>The world exploded with green. The blast wave slapped my back. I squeezed the last burst of speed from my exhausted body and cleared the pillars. I skidded to a stop and turned around. On the road the draugr stomped forward, an enormous monstrosity, dwarfing the trees, impossibly big. His magic swirled about him in a stormy cloud.</p><p>Raphael dashed out of the trees like a fur-sheathed nightmare and charged the giant, ripping into undead flesh.</p><p>I pushed Ascanio from the tripod and reloaded.</p><p>The undead tried to stomp on him, but Raphael darted back and forth, too fast, stripping dried muscle and gristle from the giant\u2019s left leg.</p><p>Kate burst from the undergrowth and thrust her sword into the draugr\u2019s right foot. I yanked the crossbow up and sighted on H\u00e5kon. Eat this, you undead piece of shit.</p><p>\u201cHit the deck!\u201d I screamed.</p><p>Raphael and Kate dashed away. I fired. The bolt took the undead below the chest, burning it with emerald flames, and exploded. Undead flesh rained, but the draugr remained upright.</p><p>Roman staggered to his feet, his face contorted by anger. He screamed something. A flock of crows fell on the giant, ripping rotting flesh from its bones.</p> <p>\u201cHelp the alpha!\u201d I barked, reloading. Ascanio dashed to the draugr.</p><p>Raphael picked Kate up and threw her. She sank her sword into the side of the draugr\u2019s leg. Magic snapped, and then a car-hood-sized kneecap crashed onto the road. Kate jumped clear. The draugr teetered and dropped to its knees.</p><p>\u201cFire in the hole!\u201d I fired another shot. For half a second the arrowhead buzzed, lodged between the undead\u2019s ribs, then it exploded, splashing emerald fire over desiccated flesh. The blast wrenched the draugr\u2019s ribs wide open and through it I saw the shriveled sack of its heart.</p><p>The crows hurtled into the hole and out of the draugr\u2019s back, dragging chunks of bone and tissue with them.</p><p>I saw the ravaged remains of the heart and fired. The arrow pierced the tough muscle. Bull\u2019s-eye.</p><p>The explosion shook the ground. Chunks of rotting corpse pelted the ground and H\u00e5kon crashed like a falling skyscraper. His chin hit the dirt, his entire skull reverberating from the impact.</p><p>Ha. We killed an unkillable giant. Eat your heart out, Beast Lord.</p><p>Kate got up and limped toward us.</p><p>Her knee. She had an old injury that kept flaring up. I had completely forgot. Damn it. \u201cIs your knee okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the knee.\u201d Kate limped past the pillar and sagged against the cart. \u201cHe backhanded me, the sonovabitch. I hit a tree trunk with my hip. I swear this leg is cursed.\u201d</p><p>Roman spat on the ground. His face was mournful. \u201cSuch a waste. One-of-a-kind and we had to kill it.\u201d</p><p>It almost tore us to pieces and he had regrets. Wow.</p><p>Raphael strode to me. His eyes were on fire.</p><p>\u201cNice shot,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThank you. You were...\u201d Awesome, brave, fast, amazing. \u201c...not so bad yourself.\u201d</p><p>Roman shook his head. \u201cSuch a waste.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll split the teeth with you,\u201d Kate said. \u201cIf you want them.\u201d</p><p>He turned to her. \u201cOf course I want the teeth. And the hair.\u201d</p><p>The two of them started for the head, looking like two starved dogs who had just found a fresh juicy carcass.</p><p>Raphael grabbed me into a bear hug. I grinned at him. This wasn\u2019t so hard after all.</p><p>Ascanio trotted up. \u201cWhy are they pulling his teeth out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re magic,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to help them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Raphael said.</p><p>The kid went off to the giant corpse, where Kate and Roman argued over the teeth.</p><p>The draugr\u2019s head moved.</p><p>\u201cWatch out!\u201d I screamed.</p><p>Kate looked at me.</p><p>I ran.</p><p>The eyes flared with green fire, the great jaws gaped, baring thick teeth. Kate whipped about, slicing with her sword.</p><p>I was six feet away when magic erupted out of the draugr\u2019s mouth, wound about Kate, and dragged her into the maw, crushing her between those stumpy teeth.</p><p>I leaped onto the skull, pulled my knife, and sliced into the tendons holding it together. Let go of my friend, you fucker!</p><p>The jaws mauled Kate, trying to crack her like a nut.</p><p>Grisly flesh tore under my fingers. I caught a glimpse of Kate\u2014she\u2019d curled into a ball, keeping away from the teeth.</p><p>The tendons I had severed snapped right back together. I needed to cut faster.</p><p>We were rising. I glanced down. The draugr had pulled himself up.</p><p>\u201cRaphael!\u201d I yelled, slicing across the flesh. \u201cHe\u2019s regenerating!\u201d Where was he?</p><p>Slayer\u2019s blade sliced through the flesh right in the corner of the joint where the mandible fit into the upper jaw. Slayer\u2019s blade smoked. Kate was trying to cut her way out.</p><p>The draugr chewed, trying to work his massive tongue to shift Kate toward his teeth.</p><p>Flies blanketed the undead, turning into maggots, eating his flesh. I sliced and diced, the maggots ate, but the more damage we did, the faster its flesh grew back.</p><p>Kate groaned. I had to get her out now.</p><p>I went furry. Shreds of my clothes fluttered to the ground. I took a short running start up the draugr\u2019s bony shoulder and kicked the temporomandibular joint. The bone popped with a dry crunch, announcing a dislocated jaw. The draugr\u2019s mouth fell open and Kate dropped out.</p><p>A huge hand swept me off the shoulder and clenched me, squeezing. I snarled and bit. Pressure ground me. My bones whined. He was crushing me as if I were a rag and he were trying to squeeze all the squishy red stuff out.</p><p>The scent of gasoline slapped me.</p><p>The pain was unbearable now. My eyes watered from pain and fury.</p><p>The draugr gripped me harder.</p><p>My shoulder gave and I screamed when my arm snapped like a toothpick.</p><p>Something sparked. Through my tears I saw the flare of fire and Raphael, his beast face furious, climbing up the draugr a hair above the flames. Raphael leaped up, clawed his way onto the creature\u2019s face, and tore an undead eye out of the left socket.</p><p>The draugr screamed and dropped me, slapping himself, trying to grab Raphael.</p><p>I fell. I tumbled down and suddenly something caught me. I saw Ascanio\u2019s face. He dropped me to my feet. Next to me Roman stood, his hands clawing the air, his staff screeching.</p><p>Above us the draugr was a pillar of flame.</p><p>A furry form jumped off the draugr, hit the tree, and dropped down. Yes! Go, Raphael!</p><p>The draugr roared and turned toward us.</p><p>Roman strained.</p><p>The undead took a slow step toward us. Then another.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not burning up,\u201d Roman screamed. \u201cI can\u2019t hold him.\u201d</p><p>The flame coated the undead\u2019s body, but none of the flesh actually charred. Damn it. Couldn\u2019t he just die?</p><p>Roman\u2019s feet slid backward. Raphael landed next to him.</p><p>Kate pulled herself upright. \u201cWhat do we do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe must break him apart and bury him. He is of the Earth, he belongs to it. The Earth will hold him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can break him if you anchor him for a second,\u201d Kate ground out. \u201cBut that\u2019s all I\u2019ve got. No more magic left after.\u201d</p><p>The draugr took another step.</p><p>Roman bent backward. His eyes rolled back in his head. Chains coated in dark smoke burst from the ground and bound the draugr\u2019s feet and wrists.</p><p>Kate opened her mouth and said a word. The magic burst from her in a torrent and smashed into the draugr, barely touching me. Panic splashed me. My fur stood on end and a hysterical hyena cackle tore out of me, echoing Raphael\u2019s lunatic laugh and Ascanio\u2019s high-pitched giggle.</p><p>The draugr jerked back, trying to run, the chains snapped taut, and his body fell apart like a toy coming to pieces at the seams.</p><p>Behind me Kate fell to the ground. Roman sobbed once and crashed next to her. It was up to the three of us now.</p><p>We ran. I grabbed an enormous arm and pulled it with all my might, into the forest, away from the road, and dug into the soil, yanking the roots out and slicing my furry fingers on jagged rocks. My arms spiked with pain. I ignored it. I dug and dug, throwing fountains of earth, until finally I pushed the piece of the arm into the hole and covered it with dirt. Then I dashed to the road, grabbed the next chunk, and did it again.</p><p>The five of us were lying on cots in the Keep\u2019s medical wing. When we had limped our way into the Keep with the scale, filthy, covered in blood and dirt, and wearing the delightful perfume of carrion mixed with gasoline and smoke, Doolittle had nearly had an aneurysm.</p><p>We had been strong-armed into the hospital wing and made to lie down in our beds. Even Ascanio, who had gotten off scot-free. Doolittle and his assistants examined us and quickly determined that Raphael had second-degree burns, I had a fractured humerus, Roman was dehydrated and had suffered a concussion, and Kate had two cracked ribs, a bruised hip, and her knee had gone out again. And then Curran walked through the doorway. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The rage of the Beast Lord was a terrible thing to behold. Some people stormed, some punched things, but Curran slipped into this icy, bone-chilling calm. His face hardened into a flat mask, and his eyes turned into a molten inferno of pure gold. If you looked at it for longer than two seconds, your muscles locked, your knees shook, and you had to fight to keep from cringing. It was easier to look at the floor, but I didn\u2019t. Besides, he wasn\u2019t angry with me. He wasn\u2019t even angry with Kate. He was angry with Anapa. I had no doubt that if he could\u2019ve gotten a hold of the god at that moment, he would\u2019ve broken him in half.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only ribs,\u201d Kate told him. \u201cAnd they\u2019re not even broken. They are fractured.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the hip,\u201d Doolittle said. \u201cAnd the knee.\u201d</p> <p>There you go. Don\u2019t expect mercy from a honeybadger.</p><p>\u201cHow long do you need to keep her?\u201d Curran looked to Doolittle.</p><p>\u201cShe can go to her quarters, provided she doesn\u2019t leave them,\u201d Doolittle said. \u201cI can\u2019t do anything else with the magic down. She must stay down until I can patch her up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe will.\u201d Curran reached for Kate. \u201cHey, baby. Ready?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. Curran slid his hands under her and picked her up, gently, as if she weighed nothing.</p> <p>\u201cGood?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She put her arm around him. \u201cNever better.\u201d</p><p>And he took her away.</p><p>\u201cSo young lady, how did you break your arm?\u201d Doolittle asked me.</p><p>\u201cShe was trying to keep Kate from being crushed,\u201d Raphael said.</p><p>\u201cA worthy cause.\u201d Dolittle peered at me. I waited for the other shoe to drop.</p> <p>\u201cDid you know your arm was broken?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd did you, by any chance, put said arm into a sling or make an effort to keep it still?\u201d</p><p>Oh Christ. \u201cNo. I was busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do with said arm?\u201d Doolittle asked.</p><p>\u201cI dug.\u201d And it hurt like hell, but at that point killing the draugr was more important.</p><p>\u201cWere you under stress?\u201d Doolittle asked.</p><p>\u201cI was trying to bury pieces of an undead giant to prevent it from rampaging through the countryside and eating any random humans he encountered. This would go a lot easier if you would just tell me where you are heading with this instead of taking the long way around.\u201d</p> <p>Doolittle nodded to one of his assistants. The short, slight woman approached Roman\u2019s cot. \u201cWe\u2019re going to put you in your own private room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this a code for killing me?\u201d Roman asked. \u201cBecause I won\u2019t be easy to take down.\u201d</p><p>She giggled and wheeled his bed out with him on it.</p><p>The medmage looked at Ascanio. \u201cYou may go, too.\u201d</p><p>The boy jumped off the bed and took off like he was on fire.</p><p>Doolittle pulled up the chair and sat next to me. His face was so gentle. \u201cI once treated a boy,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was a wererat, abused by his family. His father beat him repeatedly. He was a hateful waste of a human being and the boy\u2019s shapeshifting gave him an excuse to rage.\u201d</p><p>A lump formed in my throat. \u201cMhm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLyc-V is a very adaptive virus,\u201d Doolittle said. \u201cIf the body is injured the same way repeatedly, it responds. Shapeshifters in colder climates grow denser fur. Shapeshifters in climates with frequent sun exposure develop melanin at accelerated rate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I knew all this.</p><p>Doolittle leaned a little toward me. \u201cThe boy I mentioned developed his own coping mechanism: his bones healed extremely quickly. His body kept trying to give him tools to run away from the next beating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to the boy?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not going to worry about it right now,\u201d Doolittle said. \u201cI\u2019m going to ask some private questions. Would you like Raphael to stay or to go? Say the word and I will throw him out.\u201d</p><p>Raphael bared his teeth.</p><p>\u201cHe can stay,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cWas there physical abuse in your childhood, Andrea?\u201d Doolittle asked gently.</p><p>I swallowed. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOver some period of some time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEleven years.\u201d</p><p>Doolittle took my hand and squeezed a little. \u201cYour bones heal very rapidly under stress. The body joins them as fast as it can without any regard for whether or not they are aligned. It\u2019s simply trying to make you operational again.\u201d</p><p>I looked at my shoulder. It didn\u2019t feel quite right. \u201cYou have to rebreak my arm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Doolittle said. \u201cThe arm is crooked. Try raising it all the way.\u201d</p><p>I lifted my arm. Sharp pain shot through my shoulder right in the center of the bone.</p><p>\u201cThe longer we delay, the harder it will be to set it right,\u201d Doolittle said.</p><p>A female shapeshifter wheeled in a cart filled with instruments.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to use a mallet?\u201d I asked. In my head Doolittle put a crowbar over my shoulder and hit it with a hammer.</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019ll use a narrow power saw. You will have to be sedated. I promise you\u2019ll feel nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d What else was there to say?</p><p>The waters of the Nile lapped at my ankles. I strode out of the tepid water onto the shore. The wind brought the razor-sharp stench of blood. A fresh kill waited somewhere nearby.</p><p>The dark green bushes rustled. The Jackal walked out, dragging a dead bull by its neck. The Jackal had grown larger since we had last met. It was taller than a horse now, with a massive head and amber eyes the size of dessert plates.</p><p>The Jackal dropped the bull in front of me. \u201cEat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Food held significance to shapeshifters. Lovers gave it to each other and alphas gave it to their clans. An offer of food was sometimes a declaration of love, but more often an offer of protection in exchange for loyalty, and I wouldn\u2019t be accepting any handouts from him.</p><p>\u201cSuit yourself.\u201d The Jackal bit the bull\u2019s soft belly.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re helping you. Why not let the child go?\u201d</p><p>The Jackal raised its bloody snout from the kill. \u201cWhy would I surrender my hostage? She has served me so well.\u201d</p><p>I sat in the grass. The sun was setting again and the still waters shimmered with faint vapor. The wet sloppy sounds of the large predator eating behind me ruined the beauty of the landscape.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you do this?\u201d I asked finally.</p><p>\u201cMmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you play little games? You could\u2019ve helped us with the draugr, but you didn\u2019t. You could\u2019ve let the Pack join us. It\u2019s in your best interests to win.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s in my best interests to regain my godhood.\u201d The Jackal padded over and lay down next to me, a hill of fur and darkness. \u201cDo you know how godhood begins?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith a myth.\u201d The Jackal sighed. \u201cIt begins with a legend told by the fire. A story of magical deeds and glorious victory over evil. I was there when it began for me, over six thousand years ago. I remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho were you?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cA tribal chief,\u201d he said. \u201cI had a wife and many children. Once I saved a litter of jackal pups from a flood and they followed me everywhere I went. They brought others of their kind to the settlement. I was never bitten. I cut my leg while hunting and the pack licked it. It was a true gift.\u201d</p><p>Pieces clicked in my head. \u201cYou were a shapeshifter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was a First,\u201d he said. \u201cThe first recipient of the gift, its power undiluted within me. We, the humans, were different then. We were magic. It flowed through us, through our blood, through our bones. We were born soaked in it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you become a god?\u201d</p><p>The Jackal shrugged. \u201cThose memories are murky. My deeds were told in front of the evening fires, my victories, my adventures. They kept me alive. My descendants made me a shrine of bone and stone and prayed for my guidance. My tribe prospered and the more they prayed, the more power I gained, until finally I came to be again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust like that. People plead for help to things that are more powerful. They beg the sky for rain year after year, they make a shrine to a mage who once brought about rain or to an engineer who irrigated their fields decades ago, and if they pray hard enough, their new deity comes to life and grows in power.\u201d</p><p>The Jackal gazed at the river. \u201cThis new age, it has a saying, \u2018History is written by the victors.\u2019 It is true. Look at the story of Apep. Set, who was there with us fighting as valiantly as any one of us, became the visage of darkness. Bastet was diminished to a vermin killer. And I? I became the tender of corpses, revered, worshipped, but hardly as powerful. Even my brother Sobek, the lord of crocodiles, was more feared than I was. I hate him for that and Sobek reviles me for my knowledge and the reverence it brought. When the time of my people came to its sunset, the Greeks came. They jeered at us. They called me the Barker. The joke was on them\u2014I endured through their time and then through the Romans, but I\u2019ve never forgotten the insult.\u201d</p><p>He fell silent.</p><p>\u201cThe Pack,\u201d I prompted.</p><p>\u201cLet me tell you how my new myth will go,\u201d the Jackal said. \u201cIn the new age of magic, when it was young, a vile serpent emerged, threatening the sanity of all people. Mighty God Inepu and his faceless retainers battled him, and slew him, and triumphed. All those who do not wish to be devoured by the serpent of madness give thanks to the mighty Inepu. Ask for his blessing. Ask for his wisdom. Offer your prayers to him so he may shield you with his might. He is the mighty warrior, the awe-inspiring slayer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is an ambitious plan.\u201d So I was to be a faceless minion and he was to become a warrior god.</p><p>The Jackal looked at me. \u201cDon\u2019t mock me, pup. Godhood is like a drug; once you taste it, there is no turning back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still don\u2019t understand why you won\u2019t let the Pack assist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause they are led by a First,\u201d the Jackal said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCurran?\u201d</p><p>The Jackal nodded. \u201cIt is how I began, as a First. What is more impressive, a jackal or a lion? Which would you fear more? To whom would you offer your prayers?\u201d</p><p>I blinked. \u201cYou\u2019re afraid Curran will steal your godhood?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAfraid is a strong word. I fear nothing.\u201d The Jackal laid his head on his front paws and twitched his ear.</p><p>\u201cExcept being forgotten,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cThere is that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how does my body fit into your scheme? Wouldn\u2019t you be changing gender?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d he said. \u201cA god or a goddess, as long as I grow in power.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOne small problem,\u201d I told him. \u201cFor this plan to work, Apep has to resurrect, and we\u2019ve got his scale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe scale isn\u2019t necessary to his resurrection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? So we\u2019ve done all of this for nothing?\u201d</p><p>The Jackal raised his head. \u201cOf course not. The scale is his armor. Without it, he will be easier to kill. He will be softer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere? Where are they resurrecting him?\u201d</p><p>The Jackal laughed under his breath.</p> <p>I grabbed his ear and sank my nails into the flesh. \u201cWhere are they going to resurrect him? When?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d The Jackal whirled and bit me, taking half of my body into his huge mouth from the side. Teeth pierced my stomach and my back. \u201cYou\u2019re the detective. Figure it out.\u201d</p><p>The world snapped back at me in a rush of blinding pain, and I saw Doolittle\u2019s eyes above a surgical mask. Agony gripped my arm. Raphael snarled, \u201cShe\u2019s bleeding!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will be fine,\u201d Doolittle said, his voice calm and steady.</p><p>Some female shapeshifter I didn\u2019t know pulled the sheet down from me. A curved row of bloody teeth marks gaped in my stomach.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good,\u201d I ground out. \u201cKeep going.\u201d</p><p>Raphael took my hand in his. I squeezed it and watched the teeth marks knit themselves closed as Doolittle finished sawing through my bone.</p><p>Finally Doolittle finished. It didn\u2019t hurt once the bone was cut, or at least it didn\u2019t hurt too much. Roman sat on my bed for a while and told me funny jokes while everyone cleaned up.</p> <p>Finally they all left. Darkness had fallen\u2014I had asked for the lights to be turned off, and only moonlight remained. It spilled all around me and I felt completely and utterly alone.</p><p>I let out a long breath. It sounded more like a sob.</p><p>A shadow detached itself from the bathroom doorway and crossed the floor to me. His scent reached me first, that taunting, comforting, infuriating scent. Raphael knelt on my bed, resting one arm on the headboard, and leaned over me until our eyes were level. \u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. What makes you think there is something going on with me?\u201d</p><p>His blue eyes scrutinized me. \u201cYou came out of sedation with bite marks on your stomach and mud on your feet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMany shapeshifters come out of sedation early.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cThis is Doolittle\u2019s sedation we\u2019re talking about. What\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>I clenched my teeth to keep the words from getting out.</p><p>\u201cAndi, I\u2019m right here. Look at me.\u201d He leaned closer. \u201cLook at me.\u201d</p><p>Looking at him was a fatal mistake. The words made a break for it and I couldn\u2019t keep them down any longer. I put my arms, the good one and the one in a cast, around him. My cheek brushed his, his skin against mine, and I kissed him. I kissed him with as much tenderness and love as I could, because one way or another I would lose him.</p><p>\u201cHe wants my body,\u201d I whispered into Raphael\u2019s ear. \u201cHe wants to use it instead of his, because I have better shapeshifter magic.\u201d</p><p>His arms tightened around me.</p><p>\u201cI have to volunteer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if you don\u2019t?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cBad things will happen.\u201d I kissed him again, my arms gripping him. \u201cI\u2019ll fight him. I\u2019ll fight him with everything I have, but if it comes to that, whatever I do once he takes me over, whatever I say, it\u2019s not me.\u201d I whispered, my voice so quiet, I wasn\u2019t sure he heard it. \u201cNo matter what happens, I love you. You will always be my mate. I\u2019m so sorry. I\u2019m so sorry we ran out of time.\u201d</p><p>Raphael squeezed me, pressing me to him. \u201cYou listen to me.\u201d His whisper was a fierce promise. \u201cHe won\u2019t have you. We will kill him together. Trust me. I won\u2019t let go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou may have to,\u201d I told him. \u201cYou have to promise me that if he gets my body, you will walk away, Raphael. You\u2019ll go on, you\u2019ll find someone to love, you\u2019ll have children...\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d he told me.</p><p>\u201cPromise me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not promising shit,\u201d he said. \u201cI would die before I lost you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRaphael!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He slid in the bed next to me, holding me in his arms. His scent enveloped me, and I held on to him, until I fell asleep.</p><p>CHAPTER 15</p><p>In the morning I awoke alone in the hospital room. Doolittle delivered a huge breakfast to me and stood over me while I ate every last piece of scrambled eggs, sirloin tips, and pancakes. I gobbled it up and escaped the medical ward to go look for Roman.</p><p>I found the priest of the Evil God in a corner of the northern courtyard. It was one of those small outside spaces within the Keep, shielded by a tall wall and made to provide relative privacy. To get to it, I had to pass through the stone arch, cut in the bottom of a stocky tower, and midway to it, I heard high-pitched giggles.</p><p>The black volhv sat on a bench, surrounded by a gaggle of kids, and was making small things disappear from his hands and reappear behind their ears and in their hair. A female werejackal discreetly watched him from the wall. Visitors to the Keep were never left unsupervised, especially around children.</p><p>I leaned against the wall and watched the volhv, too. There was something so joyous about Roman. It was as if part of his life was so bleak and dark that he felt the need to live the rest of it to its fullest, squeezing every bit of fun and happiness out of it. Even his martyred, put-upon sighs had a slightly mocking quality about them, as if he only pretended to be upset.</p><p>Roman saw me. \u201cOkay, that\u2019s enough magic for today. Scatter now. Scatter, scatter, scatter.\u201d</p><p>The kids took off. Roman spread his arms. \u201cCan\u2019t help it. I\u2019m just popular.\u201d</p><p>I smiled and sat by him on the bench. \u201cI have a serious question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will give a serious answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan a god be killed?\u201d</p><p>The humor drained from Roman\u2019s face. \u201cWell, that depends on if you\u2019re a pantheist or Marxist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the difference?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe first believes that divinity is the universe. The two are synonymous and nonexistent without each other. The second believes in anthropocentrism, seeing man in the center of the universe, and god as just an invention of human conscience. Of course, if you follow Nietzsche, you can kill God just by thinking about him.\u201d</p><p>Ask a priest a question, get an enigmatic answer. Didn\u2019t matter what religion...\u201cRoman,\u201d I said. \u201cCan I kill Anubis?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to answer. Anubis is a deity, a collection of specific concepts and beliefs. You can\u2019t kill a concept, because to do so you must destroy every human being who is aware of it. Your best bet would be to identify everyone who entertained the idea of his existence and shoot them in the head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo the answer is a no?\u201d</p><p>Roman sighed. \u201cI didn\u2019t finish. You want simple answers to very complicated questions. The wrong questions. The question you should be asking isn\u2019t whether a god can be killed, but what is Anubis. You must understand the nature of a thing before you can end its existence. In Anubis\u2019s case, his divinity is partial. He requires a mortal form to survive the periods of technology. His mortal form is just that\u2014mortal. You know its nature. You know where to cut and how you can break it. You can end Anubis\u2019s mortal form. Will it end Anubis? There are no certainties in this world, but I would theorize that no, it will not. As long as there is a cult of Anubis, devoted to veneration of his specific concept with a specific image, he will continue. He will be reborn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow quickly?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cHow quickly will he come back if you nuke him?\u201d Roman frowned. \u201cHis grasp on his corporeal form is tenuous. The fact that he could be killed in itself is devastating to his divinity. People don\u2019t like to believe in gods who can be murdered and remain dead; they much prefer to believe in rebirth. If I were him, I would\u2019ve waited a couple hundred years before I decided to get my toes wet in this magic and technology mess. So the simple answer is, he will return. But not in my lifetime and likely not in that of our children or grandchildren. I would prepare anyway, because when he does come back, he\u2019ll be pissed off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo his mortal body can die?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. It\u2019s just a body. Unfortunately, it\u2019s a body with huge magical potential. I don\u2019t know what his reserves are, but he\u2019ll use every drop of them to defend himself. He\u2019s been very conservative with his shows of power so far, which probably means he\u2019s hoarding it for this final battle with Apep in case we fail.\u201d</p><p>If the mortal body was the most likely target, then fighting him in my dreams would be futile.</p><p>Roman patted my back. \u201cCheer up, deadly girl. Things have a way of working themselves out.\u201d</p><p>Not this time. But I wouldn\u2019t go meekly to the slaughter. No, I would fight him for the lives of the people I loved to the bitter end. Win or lose, Anapa would regret meeting me.</p><p>Raphael strode through the arch, followed by Ascanio. Raphael was in black jeans and a black T-shirt that complemented his hair and showed off his carved biceps. Ascanio had somehow managed to copy his outfit so precisely he looked like Raphael\u2019s younger brother. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Raphael saw Roman, registered his hand on my back, and focused on him like a shark.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sitting and talking to a pretty girl.\u201d The volhv regarded him with a slightly mocking air. \u201cWe were having a lovely time until you showed up.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s nice. How about you go somewhere else,\u201d Raphael told him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really tired of you telling me what to do,\u201d Roman said.</p><p>They\u2019d bickered the entire way back from the fight with the draugr. My arm hurt too much to pay attention, but apparently during the battle on the hill, someone had run the wrong way and the two of them had managed to collide, which disrupted Roman\u2019s binding. They blamed each other. The fact that Raphael and I had barely gotten back together and he wasn\u2019t inclined to tolerate men in my vicinity wasn\u2019t helping either.</p><p>\u201cGo. Away,\u201d Raphael said.</p><p>The volhv leaned back, his arms behind his head. \u201cHow about you go fuck yourself.\u201d</p> <p>Nice repartee. Not.</p><p>Raphael smiled. \u201cBig talk for a man in a dress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a dress. It\u2019s robes, which are my work clothes. You know, work? The thing real men do?\u201d</p><p>Uh-oh.</p><p>\u201cReal men, huh?\u201d Raphael was still smiling, and the hint of insanity in his eyes made him look slightly unhinged.</p><p>\u201cWhat was your job again?\u201d Roman frowned, pretending to think. \u201cAh yes. Don\u2019t you stand there and look pretty to impress female visitors? You\u2019re really good at that. No real skill involved. Not much of a retirement for that kind of thing, though. Doesn\u2019t help to keep a wife and kids fed either. Unless you find a rich old lady and hope she puts you in her will...\u201d</p> <p>He did not just say that.</p><p>Raphael froze, momentarily stricken speechless.</p><p>\u201cHow old would the old lady have to be?\u201d Ascanio asked. \u201cOld like forty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo back to Aunt B and stay with her,\u201d Raphael said. His voice was eerily calm. Uh-oh.</p><p>\u201cYes, Alpha.\u201d Ascanio spun on his heel and took off.</p><p>Raphael had removed him from immediate danger.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you two doing?\u201d I asked them. \u201cDon\u2019t we have a bigger fish to fry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay out of it,\u201d Raphael told me. \u201cThis is between him and me.\u201d</p> <p>I knew that look. It was his \u201cI will do this or die trying\u201d look.</p><p>\u201cI have to concur,\u201d Roman said. \u201cThis is an A-B conversation.\u201d</p><p>Two idiots. \u201cFine,\u201d I said. \u201cKnock yourselves out.\u201d</p><p>Raphael focused on Roman with the unwavering concentration of a predator sighting his prey. \u201cRight now. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Roman grinned. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>Raphael stretched, rolling his head left to right.</p><p>Roman stood, picked up his staff, and spun it like a Shaolin monk bent on a rampage. Raphael squared his shoulders.</p><p>Men. Enough said.</p><p>Roman leaned forward. Wind swirled around his feet. The black volhv shot forward, as if his black boots had wings. Raphael stepped out of the way, letting Roman pass him, spun, jumped up, and kicked Roman between the shoulder blades.</p><p>The wizard flew into the wall, but didn\u2019t hit it, because an invisible cushion of air stopped his fall. He dropped down to his feet and turned. \u201cHmm.\u201d</p><p>Raphael had a frighteningly grim look on his face.</p><p>Roman\u2019s lips moved. A cocoon of black threads slid from the ground in twisted streams, wrapping themselves around him, not quite touching.</p><p>Raphael lunged, shockingly fast.</p><p>The black threads snapped, binding around Raphael\u2019s wrist. Roman leaned back and drove a crushing sidekick into the top of Raphael\u2019s hip. It sounded like a sledgehammer pounding into a stud. I\u2019d seen it before. It was a sambo kick, part of a personal defense martial art the Russians practiced. Ow. Ow, ow, ow.</p><p>Raphael grabbed the black threads and pulled. Roman strained, pulling back.</p><p>A small boy ran through the stone arch and headed for the two of them. I jumped off the bench, ran, and caught him.</p><p>\u201cHi!\u201d he said.</p><p>I lifted him off the ground. My rebroken arm screamed a little and I shifted his weight to the other. \u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re fighting!\u201d the boy told me, pointing at the two men.</p><p>\u201cYes, they are. Where are your parents?\u201d</p><p>A couple ran through the arch, a tall man and a dark-haired woman in her late thirties, followed by a teenage girl.</p><p>\u201cDylan!\u201d The woman reached for the boy. \u201cI\u2019m so, so sorry. We just wanted to pay our respects to the alpha. We were told he would be here. We didn\u2019t mean to interrupt. We\u2019re trying to get admitted into Clan Bouda...\u201d</p><p>I looked at her face, and recognition punched me in the gut.</p><p>Michelle.</p><p>Michelle Carver, who put a nail through my hand when I was five, because she thought it was funny to hear me scream. Michelle Carver, who pelted me with bricks, after Candy broke my legs. All I could do was crawl and Michelle chased me and threw bricks and rocks at my head. Michelle, who cheered while the bitch alpha beat my mother to a bloody pulp. Michelle \u201cHit her again, Candy!\u201d</p><p>I had killed every last one of them. Every last one, except her. She had gone missing a couple of years before I came back and wiped that sadistic clan of bouda bitches off the face of the planet. I had tried to find her, but she had done a good job of covering her tracks.</p><p>Raphael let go of the threads. \u201cAndrea?\u201d</p><p>I was holding Michelle Carver\u2019s child in my hands.</p><p>I let go of the boy. He slid to the ground.</p><p>\u201cAndrea?\u201d All blood drained from Michelle\u2019s face. \u201cAndrea Nash?\u201d</p><p>She backed away from me.</p><p>Raphael started toward me.</p><p>\u201cDo you know what she is?\u201d A hysterical note vibrated in Michelle\u2019s voice. \u201cShe\u2019s beastkin.\u201d</p><p>The world suddenly became very simple. I moved. Her mate tried to stand in my way. I backhanded him, and he went flying. I grabbed Michelle by her throat and drove her into the wall, pinning her in place. My arm had fur, and my hand had claws, and Michelle\u2019s blood squirting under her skin through her jugular tickled my fingers.</p><p>\u201cTell me again what I am.\u201d I smashed the back of her head into the brick. \u201cTell me again.\u201d</p><p>Michelle croaked in my grip. She made no move to shift. She had no warrior form. She was never the strongest. No, she just liked to yip on the sidelines, picking on someone weaker out of fear. It changed nothing.</p><p>\u201cThis woman did something bad to you?\u201d Roman asked.</p><p>\u201cThis woman tortured me and my mother.\u201d</p><p>Roman shrugged. \u201cIf you want to do her, do it quick. I\u2019ll go watch the entrance for you.\u201d</p><p>He was gone. All that was left was me and Michelle\u2019s pale, soft throat. The world was red. So, so red, and every time I exhaled, it was growing angrier and redder.</p><p>Raphael\u2019s hand rested on my shoulder. He stroked me, firm fingers caressing my fur. \u201cYou have the right. It would feel good.\u201d</p><p>It would feel great. He had no fucking idea how great it would be. I wanted to tell him that I finally caught her. I had told Raphael about her before. I wanted to tell him now how much I wanted to rip her apart, but all that came out was a snarl.</p><p>\u201cI know you.\u201d Raphael put his arms around me, his mouth close to my ear, his voice soothing. \u201cIf you kill her in front of her children, it will haunt you for the rest of your life. Let go, babe. Let her go.\u201d</p><p>No! No, she didn\u2019t get to get away with this. No! Everybody else had paid, she would pay, too.</p><p>My injured arm hurt. The pain was so raw, so fresh.</p><p>She would pay. This weak, cruel waste of a human being. This piece of shit that tormented my childhood. She was the reason I\u2019d woken up holding the fucking butcher knife. She was the reason Doolittle had had to take a saw to my arm. She would pay!</p><p>\u201cLet her go, honey. Let her go, Andi. For your own sake. For me. For us.\u201d Raphael kissed my fur just below my ear. \u201cLet her go.\u201d</p><p>I wanted to sink into the red. I wanted to see her blood on my hands. But his voice held me back.</p><p>\u201cStand down,\u201d he said. \u201cHer children are watching. Stand down, honey.\u201d</p><p>I heard a tiny high-pitched sound, wailing at my side, and I realized it was the little boy bawling in hysterical fear. His sister sobbed.</p><p>\u201cYou are better than this, Andi. Do the right thing. Walk away.\u201d</p><p>As I forced my fingers open, all the pain of my memories and all my frustration tore out of me in a sharp short scream. I spun and walked away, to the other wall, as far away from her as I could.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s beastkin,\u201d Michelle breathed out. \u201cShe\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s the clan beta and my mate,\u201d Raphael said.</p><p>Michelle staggered back as if he had hit her.</p><p>Raphael\u2019s eyes were two burning pools of blood-red fire. \u201cYour application to the clan is denied. Gather your family and leave. If you\u2019re in my territory by sundown, I\u2019ll hunt you down and drag you before the clans to be tried for torture, abuse of a child, and whatever other charges our lawyers will level against you. You will be found guilty, you will suffer, and you will be executed. Your children will become the wards of the Pack and they\u2019ll loathe your name by the time they grow up.\u201d</p><p>Michelle picked up the prone body of her husband. Her daughter grabbed the boy and they ran out.</p><p>Raphael walked to me and wrapped his arms around me.</p><p>My anger broke out in tortured sobs. Tears wet my eyes. \u201cI had her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn my hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI love you, I\u2019m proud of you. It was the right thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I couldn\u2019t stop crying. I wasn\u2019t sad, I just couldn\u2019t contain it. \u201cShe should be dead. That would be the right thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor her, but not for you. It would eat you alive. It\u2019s not who you are.\u201d</p><p>I crumpled down on the ground and cried. I\u2019d learned not to cry back then, because the more I cried, the more excited they would get, but I could cry now. Nobody would stop me, and so I sat there and let it all pour out, while Raphael held me and whispered calm, loving nonsense into my ears. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I could not kill Michelle. I couldn\u2019t scar her children the way she had scarred me. But I could join the Pack and make sure that no other little girl had to face my choices. No other little bouda would be hiding, scared and alone, dreading to be found and abused again. Not on my watch. Not as long as I breathed.</p><p>Gradually my sobs died down. We sat together, Raphael and I.</p><p>\u201cFor the record, I had him,\u201d Raphael said. I could tell by his voice he was baiting me. There was comfort in the familiar needling, and right now I desperately needed it.</p> <p>\u201cDidn\u2019t look that way from where I stood. He had you all wrapped up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you think,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThat is what I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHandling that purple carpet must\u2019ve done some permanent damage,\u201d Raphael said.</p><p>\u201cTo you.\u201d</p> <p>He leaned over and murmured, \u201cI\u2019m not the one with purple stains on my butt.\u201d</p><p>Oh, it\u2019s like this, then? \u201cWould you like to be?\u201d</p><p>He grinned and nodded.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you needed backup to help you with Roman,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need backup. I can take him with one hand tied behind my back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe had one hand tied behind your back.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe it looked like that from where you were sitting...\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s how Jim\u2019s messenger found us, sitting on the ground, bickering and flirting. Jim\u2019s teams had returned from the Warren, the poor neighborhood by White Street, and they had brought information about Gloria back with them.</p><p>I sat at a large conference table filled with food and reports. Jim sat across from me, and Chandra, Clan Jackal\u2019s designated expert on ancient Egypt, sat to my left. Between us teetered small mountains of paperwork\u2014all of the information Jim\u2019s team had squeezed out of the inhabitants of the Warren. Derek joined us after the first fifteen minutes. We were looking for clues. Somewhere at this very moment, Gloria\u2019s associates were preparing to raise Apep from the dead. We needed to know where that location could be, and Gloria was our only link.</p><p>We\u2019d been at it for hours. So far I had made two piles: a big pile of stuff I\u2019d gone through and didn\u2019t consider relevant, and a very tiny pile of paper that might be something. I\u2019d covered half a legal pad in notes. I was hungry again. The lunch hour came and went without us finding a smoking gun.</p><p>\u201cIt would be nice if there was a map,\u201d Chandra said. \u201cWith a town circled on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd a note that said \u2018Secret Hideout Here\u2019?\u201d Derek added.</p><p>I scrutinized the paper in front of me. Gloria had used a private shipping service, which was faster and more reliable than the post office, but which also forced their customers to declare the exact contents of their packages. In the event your package decided to sprout tentacles when the magic hit, they wanted to be prepared for that eventuality.</p><p>This particular operative, whose name was Douglas, had tracked down the shipping company Gloria used and offered their rep an outrageous bribe for the manifest of everything delivered to Gloria\u2019s doorstep. Handmade soap, thirty bucks a bar. Expensive perfume. Pricy bath salts. Someone was living high.</p> <p>Doolittle walked through the door. \u201cShouldn\u2019t you be resting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m saving the world,\u201d I told him.</p><p>Doolittle looked mournful. \u201cI\u2019ll make us some hot chocolate.\u201d</p><p>I went down the list of deliveries: books, blah-blah, more soap, antimosquito cream. Hmm. Georgia was in the grip of a drought. I hadn\u2019t seen a mosquito in ages.</p><p>\u201cMosquito cream,\u201d I said.</p><p>Derek raised his pen. \u201cBoots. She went down to Carlos\u2019s Footwear and got herself a pair of rubber boots two days before you killed her. Some kids from the Warren nagged her for change and she told them to piss off.\u201d</p><p>Fatal mistake. Never upset the street kids.</p><p>\u201cSo we have water,\u201d Jim said.</p><p>\u201cIn the original myth, Apep lived in the river,\u201d Chandra said.</p><p>\u201cCould he be somewhere in the Chattahoochee?\u201d Derek asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Jim tapped the paper. \u201cToo risky. The Chattahoochee is too shallow and too well patrolled. Half of the city\u2019s shipping comes through it. The army would napalm a giant snake the moment they saw it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we either have lakes in the north or...\u201d Derek pulled out a map. \u201cOr the Suwanee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Suwanee River would work,\u201d Jim said. \u201cIt\u2019s deep and black water.\u201d</p><p>I dug through the manifests. \u201cShe put in an order with the teamsters for a large crate shipment to be shipped a couple of weeks ago. Supposedly glassware. It\u2019s going to...Waycross.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWaycross, Georgia?\u201d Jim asked.</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right on the edge of the Okefenokee swamp,\u201d Derek said.</p><p>\u201cThere are also crate orders for Augusta and Tallahassee,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cWe need a confirmation.\u201d Jim dug through his papers.</p><p>Derek and I burrowed into our stacks.</p><p>\u201cPontoon!\u201d Derek announced twenty minutes later. \u201cShe bought a pontoon boat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d I looked through my notes on the shipping records.</p><p>\u201cOn the fourteenth. Took it off the lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe shipped a large crate of antiques down to Folkston on the fifteenth. Where is Folkston?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe east edge of the Okefenokee.\u201d Jim rose. \u201cWe got her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be involved,\u201d I reminded him.</p><p>\u201cNo, we can\u2019t help you fight,\u201d Jim said. \u201cThere is a difference. Nobody says we can\u2019t scout the swamp and mark the way for you. You won\u2019t go in blind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get on the phone,\u201d Derek said.</p><p>They left the room.</p><p>Doolittle put a cup of hot chocolate in front of me. \u201cDrink this before you go.\u201d</p><p>I sipped it. It had to be half sugar. \u201cIt\u2019s delicious.\u201d</p><p>Doolittle patted my arm. \u201cIt\u2019s good for you. A little sugar goes a long way.\u201d</p><p>Little, huh?</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I told him. \u201cYou were always kind to me. Not many people are. I will never forget it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are coming back.\u201d Doolittle fixed me with his stare.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d I got up and hugged him.</p><p>Raphael, Roman, and I rode the ley line out of Atlanta. The magic current ran whether the magic was up or down, but when tech ruled, like it did now, the ley line speed dropped to a mere forty miles per hour. It took us several hours to get there. The magic finally spat us and our cargo out right between Waycross and Folkston into the open arms of a shapeshifter woman with a Pack Jeep. She was short, dark-haired, and had a sprinkling of freckles on her nose.</p><p>\u201cHere is your ride.\u201d She held out the keys. Raphael took them. \u201cGo down that road, take the right fork, then the second left. You\u2019ll come to the pier. There are two pontoon boats there. Take them. The way through the swamp is marked with strips of white fabric. Good luck.\u201d</p><p>She walked away.</p><p>We loaded the cargo into the Jeep, and me and my Heckler &amp; Koch UMP submachine gun called shotgun. Roman crawled into the backseat.</p><p>Twenty minutes later we pulled up before the wooden pier. In front of us a narrow channel curved into the green wall of trees and underbrush. Two pontoon boats floated on the water the color of black tea.</p><p>A crate sat on the pier. On the side someone had written in black marker, \u201cA present from Uncle Jim.\u201d</p><p>Raphael pulled the top off the crate. Pixilated ACUs\u2014Army Combat Uniforms\u2014in lovely randomized patterns of greens and browns, perfect for the swamp.</p><p>\u201cI like this uncle.\u201d I found the shortest set and stripped off my jeans.</p><p>Roman opened his eyes wide, as if he had never seen a woman in underwear before.</p><p>Raphael threw a set at him. \u201cDon\u2019t just stand there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me to wear these?\u201d Roman looked at the ACUs and put his hand over his chest, as if protecting his black robe. \u201cThat\u2019s not right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a problem with pants?\u201d Raphael asked.</p><p>Roman pulled his robe apart, revealing a pair of black jeans underneath. \u201cI always wear my pants. I just don\u2019t want to deal with that retarded outfit. I don\u2019t even know how to put it on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWear the fatigues,\u201d I told him. \u201cIt won\u2019t kill you. Not wearing them might.\u201d</p><p>Roman sighed, rolled his eyes, and stripped off his robe and jeans, revealing a muscled torso. Well. Someone worked out. Roman pulled on the fatigue pants, grabbed the black boots, folded the bottom of the pants in a practiced move, and stuffed his feet into his boots.</p><p>Hmmm.</p><p>Next he took the ACU top and rolled up both sleeves in a perfectly even summer regulation cuff. Raphael stared at him. Roman pulled the ACU on and flexed. \u201cMakes your arm bigger, see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou asshole,\u201d I punched him in the shoulder.</p><p>\u201cGentle! I bruise easily.\u201d He rubbed his carved biceps and I caught a glimpse of a tattoo on his arm: a skull wearing a beret. Army Ranger.</p><p>Now I had seen everything.</p><p>I stood on the bow of a pontoon boat and held binoculars to my eyes. Raphael sat at the helm. Roman piloted the second vessel behind us. He\u2019d brought some sort of leather harness, which he had fit over his ACUs, and stuck his staff through it. It looked silly protruding over his shoulder.</p><p>A river stretched in front of me, its waters blue-black and half hidden by lily pads and water weeds. Strange trees bordered it, couched in the brush and reeds, tall, their trunks bare and bloated at the root where they thrust from the water, then narrowing as they rose to spread in a canopy of fresh bright green. They looked prehistoric. This was not my country.</p><p>\u201cCypresses,\u201d Raphael told me, when I had asked about them a minute ago. \u201cThey are buttresses against the hurricanes.\u201d</p><p>We made our way through the labyrinth of waterways and false islands made of floating peat and covered with grass. The air smelled of water, fish, and mud. Somewhere to the left a gator roared, the sound ripping from its throat deep, powerful, and primeval, as if the swamp itself roared into our faces. There was a strange serene beauty in this ancient, wet riot of life, but I wasn\u2019t in the mood to appreciate it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ahead the river forked, flowing around an island, a dense mess of underbrush and cypresses. A small piece of white cloth dangled from the low-lying bush, dead center of the river. In the past when Jim\u2019s people had left markers, they were to the left or to the right, indicating which way we had to turn. This one was straight on.</p><p>\u201cIsland coming up,\u201d I said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re going around this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d</p> <p>Since last night, Raphael had said exactly sixteen words to me. He was distancing himself. It was probably better this way.</p><p>The boat slid into the muddy shore. I jumped out into the soggy soup of mud and water and pulled back the canvas covering the bottom of the boat. Guns stared at me, wrapped lovingly in plastic to keep the moisture out. Two shotguns. A Heckler &amp; Koch UMP submachine gun. And my baby, a Parker-Hale M-85, my sniper rifle of choice. They didn\u2019t make them anymore. She was a gift from my sniper instructor and she let me put a bullet into the center of a man\u2019s forehead at nine hundred and sixty meters. She had never failed me.</p><p>I took the rifle and one shotgun, Raphael shouldered the backpack filled with ammunition and grabbed the UMP and the other shotgun. A moment later Roman docked and pulled back his own canvas, gathering up a giant rucksack filled with magic paraphernalia, and picked up my compound bow and two quivers filled with arrows. We set off through the swamp, moving as quietly as the wet ground allowed.</p><p>The ground climbed up. There must\u2019ve been an outcropping of rock under all that mud. We kept going up the gently rising hill.</p><p>Raphael stopped. A moment later I smelled it, too\u2014smoke. We bent low, moving up the hill in complete silence, until finally we went to ground at its end.</p> <p>A small city spread out in front of the hill, stretching across the floodplain. Huts and shacks made of wood, tents, premanufactured buildings, all connected by wooden walkways, radiating from a circular channel in the center. Muddy water filled the channel, draining off into the floodplain. In its center a massive structure stretched to the sky. At least three hundred feet tall, it resembled a spiral of smooth coils, wide at the ground and narrow as it twisted about the base again and again, reaching to the flat top.</p><p>A clay spiral. Roman\u2019s prophecy was coming true.</p><p>\u201cThey built an enormous dog turd,\u201d Raphael murmured.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a snake,\u201d Roman said. \u201cLook, see the head is resting on the top, and the snake is curling down around the pyramid. They\u2019ve made their god out of clay, and then they\u2019ll animate him. It\u2019s very clever, actually.\u201d</p><p>The coils at the bottom of the pyramid were at least eighteen feet tall. I put the binoculars to my eyes. The top of the pyramid was flat. The head of a colossal clay snake rested on one side, its eyes closed, Roman\u2019s coveted staff thrust through the beginning of the snake\u2019s neck. Next to the serpent three clay man-shaped statues sat, their legs crossed, their arms resting on their knees. Behind them a short stubby altar rose. On the altar lay Anubis\u2019s fang.</p><p>I shifted the view down to the huts and counted, two, five, eight, ten, twelve...Thirty-two buildings. People walked to and fro, both men and women. A group of kids carrying fishing rods jumped off the walkway and splashed through the muddy water, heading into the swamp. A woman and a younger girl cleaned fish on a wooden table. A cat sat by their feet, waiting for a handout.</p> <p>Let\u2019s say four people per structure. That\u2019s a hundred and twenty-eight people. At least. Some buildings looked significantly larger than others.</p><p>They killed four of our people. We had come here with the idea to shoot every cultist in sight. This was a search-and-destroy type of mission. I had no problem killing the adults, but nobody ever said anything about children being present.</p><p>An unmistakable wail of an infant in distress tickled my ears. You\u2019ve got to be kidding me.</p><p>Roman sighed next to me. \u201cWhy? Why do they always bring babies into it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably to feed them to the snake,\u201d Raphael said.</p><p>Our original plan waved good-bye at us, stuck its thumb in its mouth, strained, and exploded. We had to stop the ritual. We had to get revenge for Nick, his son, and the families of other shapeshifters. And we had to make sure not to murder any kids.</p><p>\u201cWe could try for the knife,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cWhat? We run all the way to the top in the open?\u201d Roman stared at me.</p> <p>\u201cThe magic is down. Now is the best time to hit them.\u201d I glanced at Raphael, looking for support. \u201cNo knife, no Apep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did I miss?\u201d Anapa popped out of thin air and crouched down next to Roman, oblivious to mud staining his thousand-dollar suit.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to get your tooth,\u201d Raphael told him.</p><p>\u201cExcellent.\u201d He lay down on his back and put his arms behind his head. \u201cGo on. Do your thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need a diversion.\u201d Raphael looked at Roman.</p><p>The volhv furrowed his eyebrows. \u201cWhat are you looking at me for? The magic\u2019s down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have explosives in my bag,\u201d I offered. \u201cIf someone sets them off, it would buy us some time.\u201d</p><p>We looked at Anapa.</p><p>\u201cWho me?\u201d He blinked.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re not going to help at all?\u201d Roman chided him.</p><p>Anapa sighed.</p><p>I pulled the backpack open and took out flash grenades. \u201cLook, this is simple. Pull the pins like this.\u201d I pantomimed pulling the pins. \u201cThrow. Run the other way. You\u2019re the god of knowledge, you can do it.\u201d</p><p>Anapa peered at the grenades. \u201cVery well. Where do you want them thrown?\u201d</p><p>I pointed to the left strand of trees. \u201cThere. In five minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d Anapa took the grenades and walked off down the hill into the brush, looking absurdly out of place.</p><p>\u201cThink he will do it?\u201d Roman asked.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll find out.\u201d Raphael was looking at the pyramid with the intense focus of a predator. He slung the shotgun over his shoulder.</p><p>I pulled my sniper rifle out of its plastic, chambered a round, and looked through the scope. Two people were guarding the path to the snake pyramid, two more were up on the slope, and then one last one was only a few feet under the snake\u2019s head.</p><p>I took deep even breaths. Steady.</p><p>The man under the snake\u2019s head was looking straight at me. He was older, with a careworn face and wrinkles. He looked so ordinary. What the hell was he even doing here on the slope, trying to resurrect an ancient god?</p><p>Steady.</p><p>The explosion flared on the left, tearing the silence with its thunder. It\u2019s funny how a sudden threat separates people: two-thirds of the swamp city ran to their huts like good little civilians in danger, while the remaining third, armed with rifles and bows, dashed toward the explosion, trying to eliminate the danger.</p><p>I fired. A wet, red flower blossomed in the middle of the older man\u2019s forehead. He pitched back and crumpled onto the clay body of his god.</p><p>I sighted the second sentry, midway up, a blond woman, and squeezed the trigger.</p><p>Two more shots. Two more people turned into corpses. Minimal casualties. People like to note \u201cminimal\u201d and forget about \u201ccasualties,\u201d but it\u2019s the casualties that wake you up at night.</p><p>I picked off another guard, close to the path, and jumped to my feet. We ran straight ahead, single file, Raphael in the lead, his knife out, the wicked curve sharp.</p><p>A man noticed us and swung his rifle, blocking our way. Before he could pull the trigger, Raphael sliced and kept moving. The man crumpled down.</p><p>We kept going, pounding our way down the wooden walkway. A woman shot into our way, eyes wide and terrified. She opened her mouth, baring twin fangs, and lunged at Raphael. His knife flashed again. The woman fell against the side of a house.</p><p>A shout rang from the left\u2014another guard had noticed us. Two rifles snapped up. I fired faster than they did.</p><p>The walkway ended. We jumped into the mud, sinking in up to midshin, and waded through toward the pyramid looming ahead.</p><p>Bullets whistled past me. I turned around. A woman with a rifle at two o\u2019clock. Aim, squeeze, take half a second to confirm that her body splashed into the mud.</p><p>Roman lagged behind. He was moving fast for a human, but not for a shapeshifter.</p><p>\u201cRaphael!\u201d I called.</p><p>He turned around and doubled back.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ve got this,\u201d Roman said.</p><p>Raphael picked him up out of the mud and we raced to the pyramid.</p><p>The clay body of Apep wound about the structure, and I finally realized why the entire thing wasn\u2019t collapsing under its terrible weight\u2014steel beams and the edge of concrete poked out from beneath the clay. The cultists had used some sort of structure as a base. How the hell had they gotten it down into the swamp?</p><p>Raphael set Roman down and they began climbing. I lingered. The sentries had done an about-face and were running toward us. I fired. The bullet took the first man in the stomach. He dropped into the mud. I fired again, knocking the second runner out of the lineup. They scattered, taking cover behind the huts.</p><p>I turned around and followed the men up the pyramid.</p><p>Shots rang out. A bullet bit into my side. Argh. Not silver, but it hurt like hell. My body clenched and expelled it. I kept climbing.</p><p>Another bullet burrowed into the mud an inch from my head. I shifted sideways, moving along the side of the structure, trying to put the thickness of the pyramid between me and the shooters.</p><p>A hail of gunfire tore from one of the huts.</p><p>\u201cHoney!\u201d Raphael called. He was above me, shielding Roman with his body.</p><p>I turned, pressing my back against the mud, and raised my rifle. The muzzle flash gave the shooter away\u2014third hut on the left, in the window, a faint outline of a man\u2019s head. I squeezed the trigger. The rifle barked, and a man\u2019s head jerked back. The gunfire died. I turned around and kept climbing.</p><p>Above me Raphael and Roman climbed up onto the flat top of the pyramid. I grabbed the edge, pulled myself up, just as Raphael stepped toward the altar...</p><p>The magic wave drowned us. Oh no.</p><p>The clay statue of a man in front of me opened its eyes. Its human eyes. The clay figures weren\u2019t statues. They were actual people, smeared with a thick layer of mud and left to bake, motionless, under the sun. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Raphael picked up Anubis\u2019s fang off the altar.</p><p>\u201cRaphael!\u201d I screamed.</p><p>The statues jumped, breaking their coats of clay, and grabbed Raphael. He clamped the one in front of him in a death grip. I rushed them from one side, Roman from the other. The clay-covered man in front of me unhinged his jaw and sank his fangs into Raphael\u2019s side. My hands closed about his neck. I squeezed, crushing bone and cartilage, and jerked the corpse aside, hurling if off the pyramid.

Don\u2019t die.</p><p>I sank two more shots into him and then three more into the other bite.</p> <p>\u201cBehind you,\u201d Raphael barked.</p><p>I whipped around. The fourth statue snapped upright right next to the snake\u2019s head, half-hidden by the serpent\u2019s skull. Roman charged it.</p><p>The clay-smeared man howled something wordless and angry. Roman shoved his staff into the man\u2019s chest. The scream turned to a gurgle, as blood spilled from the cultist\u2019s mouth. Roman freed the staff with a sharp jerk, stumbled back, and slid down, leaving a bloody smudge on the clay Apep\u2019s neck.</p><p>\u201cThe knife,\u201d Raphael squeezed out. His body bucked in my hands, rigid.</p><p>I shot more antivenom into him. It was all I could do.</p><p>\u201cThe knife,\u201d he croaked.</p> <p>I reached for Anubis\u2019s fang, which had fallen from his hand.</p><p>A man\u2019s hand snatched it before I could touch it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take that, thank you!\u201d Anapa strode to Apep.</p><p>Roman blocked his way. The god backhanded him. Roman crashed into the altar. Anapa raised the knife. A jackal howled, loud, deafening.</p><p>I lunged at him and hit an invisible wall. It tossed me back and I fell on Raphael.</p><p>Anapa plunged the knife into Apep\u2019s skull.</p><p>The clay serpent shuddered. The pyramid shook under us. Cracks sprang on Apep\u2019s blunt nose. The colossal head rose, teetered upright, and fell backward. The clay serpent slid off the pyramid into the mud.</p><p>\u201cThe show will go on after all!\u201d Anapa spun around, grinning with a mouth full of jackal teeth. \u201cHere we go.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou fucking bastard!\u201d I snarled.</p><p>Raphael shook under my hands. He was going into convulsions.</p><p>\u201cI must have my myth.\u201d Anapa laughed and vanished.</p><p>The swamp shook. A flock of birds rose from the trees, darkening the sky.</p><p>\u201cSnakes.\u201d Roman pushed himself from the altar.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFlying snakes.\u201d He planted the staff into the pyramid and began to chant. Darkness swirled around his feet, flashes of pure black emptiness suffused with silver lightning.</p><p>The cloud headed for us. Raphael\u2019s limbs shook, gripped by a spasm. I pried his jaws open and forced the handle of the knife into his mouth. I had no more antivenom. I\u2019d injected him with our entire supply.</p><p>A deep-voiced bell tolled, echoed by the distant silvery ringing of smaller bells. Eerie male voices chanted in tune to Roman\u2019s incantations. The snakes swarmed above us, turning the sky black.</p><p>Wind twisted about Roman. I hugged Raphael to me.</p><p>The snakes plunged at us...and hit an invisible wall, as if a transparent half-sphere shielded us from their onslaught. They touched the wall and slid along the edge of the spell, turning smaller, darker, losing their wings, until they finally landed on the side of the pyramid and slid down into the mud as plain rat snakes.</p><p>Raphael gripped my hand, struggling to say something. His eyes rolled back in his head.</p><p>I clenched him to me. No, this wasn\u2019t the way it was supposed to be. The antivenom had to work. It had to...</p><p>The last of the snakes fell. Roman dropped to his knees, out of breath, his face pale.</p><p>A loud hiss rolled through the swamp as if a thousand snakes opened their mouths in unison. I leaned forward.</p><p>Below us a serpent the size of a cargo train circled the pyramid, sliding through the mud. His body shimmered and twisted with a constantly moving mosaic of brown and yellow.</p><p>Raphael\u2019s heels drummed the ground. He was dying. He was dying and I was out of antivenom.</p><p>\u201cNow would be a good time to make some choices,\u201d Anapa said next to me.</p><p>I grabbed his leg, jerked him down, and locked my hands around his throat. They never touched his skin. A barrier of magic held me back. I squeezed, straining with all my strength. He smiled.</p><p>The pyramid shook as the colossal snake curved around it.</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d I snarled. \u201cYou!\u201d</p><p>A titanic serpent\u2019s head rose, hovering above us. A long tongue slivered out of the lipless mouth to taste the air.</p><p>\u201cYou know what you have to do,\u201d Anapa said. His head melted, changing shape, and suddenly my hands touched the thick, furry throat of a Jackal.</p><p>I gripped it. \u201cI\u2019ll kill you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me what I want and he will live,\u201d the Jackal said.</p><p>I didn\u2019t hesitate for a second. \u201cDo it and you can have me.\u201d</p><p>A yellow sheen rolled over the Jackal\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cAndrea?\u201d Raphael said behind me, his voice almost normal. \u201cAndrea?\u201d</p><p>My feet left the ground. I floated up, weightless. The Jackal floated next to me, huge as a three-story house, his head shaggy with fur, his yellow eyes bottomless. Raphael was screaming something down below.</p><p>I love you, darling.</p><p>I love you.</p><p>Forgive me.</p><p>The Jackal opened its mouth and gulped me. Magic flowed from me, binding me, anchoring me inside the Jackal, connecting us and circulating out of him into me and back to him. We merged, the monstrous beast and I, and suddenly we were once again solid and the old enemy reared its ugly head in front of us.</p><p>Apep hissed and struck.</p><p>We dodged, lithe and fast.</p><p>The serpent smashed into the corner of the pyramid. The entire pathetic mud pile shook and careened. Humans screamed. Morons. Small pathetic morons wriggling in the mud building their mud-hill temple.</p><p>Apep coiled himself, his head swaying back and forth. We ran around him, mashing the mud with our paws and snarling. Apep opened its mouth, the magic roiling inside its dark maw.</p><p>We yipped and barked, baiting it.</p><p>Apep struck, like a coiled spring, and missed.</p><p>We danced around it, so fast, so clever.</p><p>Stupid snake. Foolish, foolish, weak snake.</p><p>Apep lunged. Fangs struck our paw. We snapped our teeth and it let go.</p><p>Little humans cheered. Venom coursed through our veins. No matter. We had enough magic to cleanse our blood easily.</p><p>We danced around the serpent. It turned, but not fast enough. We bit its tail and ran, dragging it around the floodplain, its blood a burning inferno on our tongue.</p><p>Look at us pulling your god by its tail. Look at us, little things. Look at me. I am Inepu. I am the better god.</p><p>Apep coiled back and struck, but I opened my mouth and danced away, too fast for it. Apep gathered itself into a spiral.</p><p>I circled it. Bite from the left. The snake mouth met me and I withdrew.</p><p>Strike from the right. Again the snake mouth barred my way.</p><p>I will win. I will endure.</p><p>I will triumph.</p><p>I am Inepu.</p><p>My magic was weakening. My worshipers were still few. So few. But not as few as Apep\u2019s.</p><p>I snapped my teeth, lunging low.</p><p>Apep shot out. Its fangs pierced my fur and skin. Fire and night rolled into my veins, threatening to end me. I let the serpent bite me and just as it let go, I bit its neck, sinking my teeth deep into its flesh.</p><p>Die. Die...</p><p>Go back into nothing. Dissolve and be forgotten, so I will stand in your place.</p><p>Apep writhed in my jaws, whipping its body at me, clenching, coiling, but I held on and bit harder and harder.</p><p>The last of my magic was almost spent.</p><p>My fangs found bone. I jerked the body of my enemy up and bit down with all my might.</p><p>Apep hung limp in my jaws.</p><p>I held him high, showing everyone my triumph.</p><p>Witness my might. Remember it.</p><p>In the mud, small things knelt. I felt the first stirring of devotion, the delicious addictive splashes of their faith.</p><p>Worship me. Feed me.</p><p>The pliant flesh in my mouth turned to clay. The serpent\u2019s body crumbled and I released it. It crashed into the mud in chunks of clay. I howled, announcing my victory.</p><p>The small things fled. No matter. They would remember me. Soon, when I recovered, I would find them and add them to my worshippers. The current of faith would flow.</p><p>I stood there, exhausted, exhilarated, intoxicated by my power. Invincible.</p><p>I was a god.</p><p>Weakness flooded me, slowly. The last of my magic was spent. I staggered to their former god\u2019s ruined temple. I let go of my form and assumed my new human shape. Healthy. Beautiful. Full of magic and so blissfully easy to heal.</p><p>I studied my perfectly formed fingers, my arms, my long, muscled legs.</p><p>I was beautiful.</p><p>A man walked toward me through the mud. What was the name...</p><p>Raphael.</p><p>Raphael!</p><p>I crushed the small voice inside me, smothering it.</p><p>The man kept walking. He had a strange look on his face. Humans are curious creatures. This one was...angry? No...grieving, perhaps, but no, that wasn\u2019t quite right either.</p><p>Perhaps I should kill\u2014</p><p>The magic jerked me back. I had forgotten. I had made the bargain. I had promised he would live.</p><p>The human was close now. Determination. That was it. I needed to retreat, to fold myself into the limit of the human mind, but not yet. Not yet. I had just vanquished my enemy. I deserved this, deserved the worship, the taste of power to come.</p><p>Perhaps he was coming to kill me. But then any damage he could do, I would heal.</p><p>I raised my arms. \u201cWhat do you think of my body?\u201d</p><p>The human attacked. I saw it, saw the glove on his hand with long pale metal claws, and I willed my magic to shield me, but too little was left. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He thrust his metal claws into my chest and scoured my heart.</p><p>It burned! It burned like fire. Pain writhed through me, tearing me apart. I\u2019d never felt an agony like this, an all-consuming, terrible pain. I shoved him back, but the pain didn\u2019t stop.</p><p>The claws had broken off. They ripped my heart apart. My magic streamed past it, unable to remove them. I couldn\u2019t heal the damage.</p> <p>I was dying.</p><p>I screamed, and the trees shook from my howl.</p><p>I flailed, trying to rip the metal out of me.</p><p>No. No, I would not die today. I tore myself from my new form and fled, into the mud, into the sludge, where my old form slumped, discarded.</p><p>The world slammed into me in an explosion of pain. Silver burned in my heart.</p> <p>\u201cI got you,\u201d Raphael was holding me. \u201cI\u2019ve got you.\u201d</p><p>I was dying.</p><p>Suddenly Doolittle was there with the scalpel.</p><p>Where had he even come from? Was I hallucinating before death?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Raphael crooned in my ear.</p><p>Doolittle sliced my chest open. \u201cExpel this silver if you want to live!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo it, Andrea!\u201d Raphael snarled.</p><p>I pushed against the burning points of pain. Doolittle dug in my open chest with forceps. I screamed.</p><p>\u201cExpel!\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t breathe. My chest was on fire, and the unbearable, terrible pain burned inside me like an inferno.</p><p>The first shard slid out of me. Doolittle plucked it out with forceps.</p><p>The world dimmed, as if someone was blowing out its candles one by one. Doolittle raised his hand. I caught a glimpse of a syringe. Doolittle plunged it down. The needle bit me in the heart.</p><p>The darkness tore in a blinding flash of light and adrenaline.</p><p>\u201cSilver!\u201d Raphael screamed at me. \u201cGet it out!\u201d</p> <p>I strained. Another shard slid free.</p><p>\u201cDo it, Andrea!\u201d Raphael growled.</p><p>\u201cExpel,\u201d Doolittle commanded.</p><p>It hurt and I was so tired.</p><p>Another shard left me.</p><p>\u201cLast one,\u201d Doolittle barked.</p><p>The world went black.</p><p>It was so cold and quiet. Can I please stay here...</p><p>I opened my eyes to agony and Doolittle massaging my heart with his fingers.</p><p>I screamed, but my voice was just a hoarse croak.</p><p>The last point of agony slid out of me. Raphael laid me flat. Doolittle knelt over me. His hands were bloody. He was holding some sort of surgical instrument. A woman handed him gauze. A cooling sensation spread through my insides. I was going numb.</p><p>Behind him I saw Anapa stagger to his feet.</p><p>Eyes lit up in the swamp. I saw them with shocking clarity, hundreds of eyes.</p><p>A flood of furry bodies poured from the underbrush. Jackals. Dozens upon dozens of them, and in the lead were the huge, muscled shapes of shapeshifters in their warrior form. Clan Jackal had arrived.</p><p>They circled Anapa.</p><p>\u201cWe will take the child now,\u201d a gray shapeshifter in a warrior shape said.</p><p>\u201cGive us the child.\u201d</p><p>Anapa smiled a lopsided grin that bared his teeth and thrust his arms up. Magic flowed from him in a slow wave.</p><p>The Jackals pushed against it.</p><p>The enormous alpha in front howled. Hundreds of voices answered in a chorus of howls, barks, and yips.</p><p>Anapa pushed.</p><p>Clan Jackal gained a foot. Another foot.</p><p>Anapa clenched his teeth. There were too many of them and he was too weakened.</p><p>\u201cGive us the child,\u201d snarling voices demanded.</p><p>\u201cReturn the child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReturn!\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d Magic pulsed, knocking the first few Jackals back. Others took their place. He didn\u2019t have enough juice to disappear. I had been inside him, and I knew. He\u2019d spent everything on that fight.</p><p>\u201cHere!\u201d He spat. \u201cHave her.\u201d</p><p>A little girl materialized in the middle of the Jackal pack. One of the warriors snatched her and ran toward us. The Jackals kept moving, step by step, tightening the ring.</p><p>\u201cI gave you what you wanted!\u201d</p><p>The Jackals closed in, one step at a time, eyes on fire, fangs gleaming.</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d</p><p>They swarmed him. He screamed, but not for very long.</p><p>I sat on a muddy log. My heart was beating inside me. Doolittle had mended it through a gaping hole in my chest, while I screamed, and then he\u2019d repaired my rib cage, and then he had sealed my wounds. He sat next to me now, wiping my blood off his hands with a wet rag. His eyes were red. He had a terrible look on his face.</p><p>Raphael knelt by him. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Doolittle shook his head. \u201cI didn\u2019t hear that. What did you say?\u201d</p><p>Raphael leaned closer. \u201cI said, thank\u2014\u201d</p><p>Doolittle grabbed his throat and smashed his head into Raphael\u2019s face. It was the most vicious head butt I had ever seen. Raphael fell back. Doolittle snarled something under his breath and walked away.</p><p>Raphael shook his head. Blood gushed from his broken nose.</p><p>\u201cI think he\u2019s mad at you,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll get over it.\u201d Raphael grinned at me.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know I wouldn\u2019t die?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTook a chance, huh?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cWe had nothing to lose.\u201d</p><p>Behind him the Jackals had dismantled one of the huts and dragged Anapa\u2019s dismembered corpse onto a pile of wood. Two shapeshifters in warrior form dumped fuel onto the boards and set it on fire.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know Anapa would panic?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cWhen you told me he had started as a shapeshifter, I went to the Jackals looking for their research on Anubis\u2019s weaknesses. They took it very seriously. Half of the Clan was digging up information. They said that in ancient Egypt, when Anubis was still human, silver was virtually unknown. The Egyptians started getting it later, through imports, and even then it was highly prized. There was no reason he would know how silver affected shapeshifters from personal experience. Roman said that he would likely retreat to the old Anapa body if he was threatened. Clan Jackal trailed us. His ego was so colossal, he didn\u2019t view them as a threat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t even notice them,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cThe hardest part was talking Doolittle into that emergency open-heart surgery. He really didn\u2019t want to do it. We argued for hours. He thought you wouldn\u2019t survive.\u201d Raphael swallowed. He looked sick.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you? Is it the poison?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just realized you died on me twice.\u201d Raphael rolled to his feet and staggered off.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need a minute.\u201d</p><p>He stumbled into the bushes and I heard him vomit.</p><p>A shadow came over me. Roman sat on a log next to me. He was carrying something long and wrapped in plastic.</p><p>\u201cNice guy,\u201d Roman said. \u201cAn asshole, but he loves you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love him, too.\u201d I petted his hand. \u201cThank you for everything. I had fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had fun, too.\u201d He grinned. \u201cLook what I got.\u201d He pulled the plastic back. The Bone Staff.</p><p>\u201cYou got it?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cSpent an hour digging through that clay. Worth every minute.\u201d He leaned over and kissed my cheek. \u201cI\u2019ll see you around. You call if you need anything, yes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I agreed. \u201cYou call me, too. I owe you some help. As long as I don\u2019t have to sacrifice any babies, I\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll count on it.\u201d</p><p>He walked off and Raphael took his place, rinsing his mouth with water from a canteen. Around us, the shapeshifters were herding the snake people into a group. I was covered in mud, blood, and swampy muck. Raphael looked even worse, his hair smeared with gore. I really wanted to go back home, take a shower, and sleep for a year.</p><p>\u201cHelp me off the log?\u201d I asked him.</p><p>\u201cNo. We\u2019re going to get you a nice stretcher and carry you down to the boats.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay to walk. My chest hurts a little, but I can make it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are certifiable,\u201d he told me. He reached into his pocket and pulled out a plastic bag.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI swore that if we made it through today, I would do this.\u201d Raphael pulled a small plastic box out of the bag and got down on his knees in the mud.</p><p>This was crazy.</p><p>He opened the box. A white engagement ring with a band shaped like a beast\u2019s paw lay on a small velvet pillow, with a beautiful sapphire clasped in its tiny white claws.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fucked up,\u201d he said. \u201cI have many faults. But I promise if you marry me, I will love you and take care of you for the rest of our lives.\u201d</p><p>I stared at him.</p><p>\u201cIf you put up with me, I will put up with whatever you can throw my way,\u201d he said. \u201cBad days, good days, \u2018I\u2019ll cut you if you look at me the wrong way\u2019 days. I\u2019ll take them all.\u201d</p><p>I knew I had to say something.</p><p>\u201cIf you kill her with this after everything I\u2019ve done,\u201d Doolittle said behind me. \u201cYou will never leave this swamp.\u201d</p><p>Raphael searched my face, anxious. \u201cAndi?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I told him. \u201cIn sickness and in health, poor, rich, I don\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>He was still looking at me, as if he hadn\u2019t heard.</p><p>\u201cYes, Raphael.\u201d I laughed or cried, I wasn\u2019t sure. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPut the ring on her, you fool,\u201d Doolittle said.</p><p>Raphael slipped the ring on my finger and I hugged him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d kiss you,\u201d Raphael said. \u201cBut I need to brush my teeth and I\u2019m covered in blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d I told him. \u201cKiss me anyway.\u201d</p><p>EPILOGUE</p><p>My Pack admittance ceremony was held on Tuesday in the Pack\u2019s main gathering place, a large room deep below the Keep, where the terraced ground sloped in \u201csteps\u201d toward the stage with the metal fire pit. I\u2019d heard Kate describe it before, but I had never seen it. I thought about dressing up, but it seemed kind of pointless. Whichever outfit I wore, I would still be me and that\u2019s what really counted. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A few minutes before ten p.m., Martina knocked on the door to the small room where I was asked to wait. \u201cIt\u2019s time.\u201d</p><p>I followed her down the stairs, lower and lower. I had no idea the Keep went that deep underground.</p><p>Finally she stopped before a solid door. \u201cNervous?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot really.\u201d I had spent the morning sitting in a small room with Raphael and the families of the four murdered shapeshifters, telling them the whole long story. The Pack had rounded up the snake people. It didn\u2019t take long for the truth to come out: Raphael\u2019s crew was murdered by Saii, the priests. They were the only ones with poison glands. The rest of the snake people had fangs, but their bites were hardly fatal. All six of the Saii were dead. I took out Gloria, Roman and I had killed Sanchez on the bridge, and the four remaining perished before our battle with Apep. The Pack loaded the remaining cultists and what little baggage they had onto the boats and shipped them under armed escort out of the Pack\u2019s territory. They were forbidden to return. Derek oversaw the convoy and said that most of them seemed relieved. The Saii had worked them like slaves.</p><p>I got to hold Baby Rory again. We made a pact, he and I. He would grow up to be kind and strong, and I would make sure that his clansmen would never mistreat him or break his bones.</p><p>I was able to look Nick in the eye when I told him that the people who had murdered his wife would never again hurt anyone else. He thanked me. This ceremony paled in comparison.</p><p>\u201cLast chance to turn back,\u201d Martina said.</p><p>I knew what waited behind the door. Raphael and his mother. A few members of Clan Bouda. Kate and Curran. My friends, my alpha, my mate, and the new future. For once, I wouldn\u2019t have to hide who I was.</p> <p>I opened the door.</p><p>The vast chamber stretched in front of me, dipping down to the stage, on which a metal fire pit stood. Flames danced inside it.</p><p>Behind the pit stood Aunt B. To the left, Curran and Kate sat, together with the other alphas and betas. Shapeshifters occupied the terraced steps surrounding them. Hundreds of shapeshifters. Suddenly I was nervous.</p><p>There was no turning back. I raised my head and marched down the stairs toward the fire, looking straight at Raphael for support. The stairs lasted for an eternity. Finally I stopped next to Aunt B.</p><p>\u201cWe gather here to invite Andrea Nash to the Pack,\u201d Aunt B said, her voice carrying through the room. \u201cYou know her. She has fought for us. She has given her blood and used her skills for the good of the Pack. Today we honor her sacrifice and accept her as one of our own. If any of you have a problem with that, rise and challenge me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you!\u201d someone quipped from the right.</p> <p>Light laughter ran through the room. I tried to keep still, but the giggles bubbled up out of me.</p><p>Aunt B grinned. \u201cIt\u2019s your turn, dear. Your moment.\u201d</p><p>I stepped to the fire and pulled my sleeve back. The flames crackled and burned in the fire pit. I thrust my forearm into the fire. The flames licked, searing my flesh. The smell of burned hair from my arm whiffed up. I held it for another second to prove that I was in control. No loup could touch the flames. It inspired strong instinctual terror in them.</p><p>I lowered my arm, trying not to wince at the pain, and said the first words of my oath. \u201cI, Andrea Nash, a human and a shapeshifter, swear to abide by the laws of the Pack and my clan. I swear to obey my alphas and honor my clan\u2019s traditions. I swear to be loyal to my Pack brothers and sisters, to guard them from harm, and should the need arise, to fight to my death at their side...\u201d</p><p>MAGIC</p><p>GIFTS</p><p>A Kate Daniels Novella</p><p>CHAPTER 1</p> <p>I was ten feet from the office door of Cutting Edge Investigations when I heard the phone ring inside. Unfortunately, the key to the office was in my sweatshirt pocket, which at the moment was also full of pale pink slime dripping from the tentacles resting on my shoulders. The tentacles weighed about seventy pounds and my shoulders really didn\u2019t like it.</p><p>Behind me, Andrea, my best friend and partner in crime solving, shifted the bulbous mass of flesh that was the rest of the creature, rearranging it. \u201cPhone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hear it.\u201d I dug in my pocket, all but glued shut by slime. Cold wetness slipped through my fingers. Ew.</p><p>\u201cKate, it could be a client.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to find the key.\u201d</p><p>Clients meant money, and money was in short supply. Cutting Edge had opened its doors three months ago, and while we were getting a trickle of paying jobs, most of them were lousy. Despite a good recommendation from the Red Guard, the premier bodyguard outfit in Atlanta, clients weren\u2019t knocking down our door to hire us.</p><p>Our world was beset by magic waves. They flooded us at random, smothering technology and leaving monsters in their wake. One moment you had rogue mages spitting fireballs and lightning, the next the magic would vanish, and the cops would gun down said mages with their now-operational firearms.</p><p>Sadly, the consequences of the magic waves didn\u2019t always vanish with them, and Atlanta by necessity had spawned many agencies to deal with magic hazmat. All of them had been in business a lot longer than us: the cops, the Mercenary Guild, a slew of private companies, and the big gorilla, the Order of Merciful Aid. The Order and its knights made it their mission to guard humanity against all threats and they did just that\u2014but on their terms. Both Andrea and I had worked for the Order at some point and both of us had left under less than amicable circumstances.</p><p>Our reputations weren\u2019t stellar, so when we got a job, it was because everyone else in town had already shot it down. We were quickly turning into Atlanta\u2019s business of last resort. Still, every successful job was a check mark by our name.</p><p>The phone rang, insistent.</p><p>Our latest job had come courtesy of the Green Acres Home Owners Association, who had shown up at our door this morning claiming that a giant levitating jellyfish was roaming their suburb and could we please come and get it, because it was eating local cats. Apparently the translucent jellyfish was floating about with half-digested cat bodies inside it, and the neighborhood children were very upset. The cops told them that it wasn\u2019t a priority, since the jellyfish hadn\u2019t eaten any humans yet, and the Mercenary Guild wouldn\u2019t get rid of it for less than a grand. The HOA offered us $200. Nobody in their right mind would do the job for that price.</p><p>It took us all damned day. And now we had to properly dispose of the cursed thing, because dealing with the corpses of magical creatures was like playing Russian roulette. Sometimes nothing happened...and sometimes the corpse melted into a puddle of sentient carnivorous protoplasm. Or hatched foot-long blood-sucking leeches.</p><p>The weight of the jellyfish suddenly vanished from my shoulders. I rummaged in my pocket and my fingertips slid against the cold metal. I yanked the key out, slipped it into the lock, and swung the heavy reinforced door open. Aha! Victory.</p><p>I lunged through the door and made a break for the phone. I reached it a second too late and the answering machine came on. \u201cKate,\u201d Jim\u2019s voice said. \u201cPick up the phone.\u201d</p><p>I backed away from the phone like it was on fire. I knew exactly what this call was about and I didn\u2019t want any of it.</p><p>\u201cKate, I know you\u2019re there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cYou will have to deal with this, sooner or later.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cNo, I won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall me.\u201d Jim hung up.</p><p>I turned to the door and watched Andrea walk through it. Behind her, the jellyfish squeezed through the doorway on its own. I blinked. The jellyfish kept coming. It cleared the door, turned, and I saw Curran carrying it in his hands, as if the three-hundred-pound mass of flesh was no heavier than a plate of pancakes. It\u2019s good to be the Beast Lord.</p><p>When had he arrived and what was he doing here, anyway?</p><p>\u201cWhere to?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cBack room,\u201d Andrea said. \u201cHere, I\u2019ll show you.\u201d</p><p>I followed them and watched Curran pack the jellyfish into the biohazard container. He slid the lid in place, locked the clamps, and closed the distance between us. I held my slimy arms out to keep him from getting covered in ooze, leaned forward, and kissed the Beast Lord. He tasted like toothpaste and Curran, and the feel of his lips on mine made me forget the lousy day, the bills, the clients, and the two gallons of slime drenching my clothes. The kiss lasted only a couple of seconds, but it might as well have been an hour, because when we broke apart, it felt like I had come home, leaving all my troubles far behind.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he said, his gray eyes smiling at me.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>Behind him, Andrea rolled her eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d I asked him.</p><p>Curran almost never came to visit my office, especially not in the evening. He hated Atlanta and its teeming masses with all the fire of a supernova. I didn\u2019t have anything against Atlanta in theory\u2014sure, it was half-eroded by the magic waves and it caught on fire with alarming frequency\u2014but I had a thing about crowds. When my workday was over, I didn\u2019t linger. I headed straight for the Keep, where the Atlanta shapeshifter Pack and His Furry Majesty resided.</p><p>\u201cI thought we\u2019d go to dinner,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a while since we\u2019ve gone out.\u201d</p><p>Technically we had never gone out to dinner, just the two of us. Oh, we had eaten together in the city but usually it was accidental and most of those times had involved other people and frequently ended in a violent incident.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the occasion?\u201d</p><p>Curran\u2019s blond eyebrows came together. \u201cDoes there have to be a special occasion for me to take you out to dinner?\u201d</p><p>Yes. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He leaned in to me. \u201cI missed you and I got tired of waiting for you to come home. Come grab a bite with me.\u201d</p><p>Grabbing a bite sounded heavenly, except Andrea would be stuck here by herself. \u201cI have to wait for Biohazard to pick up the jellyfish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got it,\u201d Andrea offered. \u201cGo, there\u2019s no reason for both of us to sit here. I have some stuff I need to take care of anyway.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I hesitated.</p><p>\u201cI can sign forms just as well as you,\u201d Andrea informed me. \u201cAnd my signature doesn\u2019t look like the scratches of a drunken chicken in the dirt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy signature is just fine, thank you very much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah. Go have some fun.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI need a shower,\u201d I told Curran. \u201cI\u2019ll see you in ten minutes.\u201d</p><p>It was Friday, eight o\u2019clock on a warm spring night, my hair was brushed, my clothes were clean and slime-free, and I was going out with the Beast Lord. Curran drove. He did it very carefully, concentrating on the road. I had a feeling he\u2019d learned to drive as an adult. I drove carefully too, mostly because I expected the car to fail on me at any second.</p><p>I glanced at Curran in the driver\u2019s seat. Even at rest, like he was now, relaxed and driving, he emanated a kind of coiled power. He was built to kill, his body a blend of hard, powerful muscle and supple quickness, and something in the way he carried himself telegraphed a shocking potential for violence and a willingness to use it. He seemed to occupy a much larger space than his body actually did and he was impossible to ignore. The promise of violence he carried used to scare me, so I\u2019d bait him until some of it came out, the same way people afraid of heights would rock climb to cure themselves. Now I just accepted him, the way he accepted my need to sleep with a sword under my bed.</p><p>Curran caught me looking. He flexed, letting the carved muscles bulge on his arms, and winked. \u201cHey, baby.\u201d</p><p>I cracked up. \u201cSo where are we going?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cArirang,\u201d Curran said. \u201cIt\u2019s a nice Korean place, Kate. They have charcoal grills at the tables. They bring you meat and you cook it any way you want.\u201d</p><p>It figured. Left to his own devices, Curran consumed only meat, punctuated with an occasional dessert. \u201cThat\u2019s nice for me, but what will your vegetarian Majesty eat?\u201d</p><p>Curran gave me a flat look. \u201cI can always drive to a burger joint instead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, so you\u2019d throw a burger down my throat and then expect making out in the backseat?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cWe can do it in the front seat instead, if you prefer. Or on the hood of the car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not doing it on the hood of the car.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs that a dare?\u201d</p><p>Why me?</p><p>\u201cKate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep your mind on the road, Your Furriness.\u201d</p><p>The city rolled by, twisted by magic, battered and bruised but still standing. The night swallowed the ruins, hiding the sad husks of once mighty, tall buildings. New houses flanked the street, constructed by hand with wood, stone, and brick to withstand magic\u2019s jaws.</p><p>I rolled down the window and let the night in. It floated into the car, bringing with it spring and a hint of wood smoke from a distant fire. Somewhere a lone dog barked out of boredom, each woof punctuated by a long pause, probably to see if the owners would let him in.</p><p>Ten minutes later we pulled into a long, empty parking lot, guarded by old office buildings that now housed Asian shops. A typical stone building with huge storefront windows sat at the very end, marked by a sign that read ARIRANG.</p><p>\u201cThis is the place?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMhm,\u201d Curran said.</p><p>\u201cI thought you said it was a Korean restaurant.\u201d For some reason I had expected a hanok house with a curved tiled roof and a wide front porch.</p><p>\u201cIt is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt looks like a Western Sizzlin.\u201d In fact, it probably used to be a Western Sizzlin.</p><p>\u201cWill you just trust me? It\u2019s a nice place...\u201d Curran braked, and the Pack Jeep screeched to a stop.</p><p>Two skeletally thin vampires sat at the front of the restaurant, tethered to the horse rail with chains looped over their heads. Pale, hairless, dried like leathery jerky, the undead stared at us with mad glowing eyes. Death had robbed them of their cognizance and will, leaving behind mindless shells driven only by bloodlust. On their own, the bloodsuckers would slaughter anything alive and keep killing until nothing breathing remained. But their empty minds made a perfect vehicle for necromancers, who telepathically navigated them like remote-controlled cars.</p><p>Curran glared at the undead through the windshield. Ninety percent of the vampires belonged to the People, a weird hybrid of a corporation and a research institute. We both despised the People and everything they stood for.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t resist. \u201cI thought you said this was a nice place.\u201d</p><p>He leaned back, gripped the steering wheel, and let out a long growling, \u201cArgh.\u201d</p><p>I chuckled.</p><p>\u201cWho the hell stops at a restaurant in the middle of navigating undead?\u201d Curran squeezed the wheel a little. It made a groaning noise.</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cMaybe the navigators got hungry.\u201d</p><p>He gave me an odd look. \u201cThis far away from the Casino means they\u2019re out on patrol. What, did they suddenly get the munchies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCurran, ignore the damn bloodsuckers. Let\u2019s go and have a date anyway.\u201d</p><p>He looked like he wanted to kill somebody.</p><p>The world blinked. Magic flooded us like an invisible tsunami. The neon sign above the restaurant winked out and a larger brilliant blue sign ignited above it, made from handblown glass and filled with charged air.</p><p>I reached over and squeezed Curran\u2019s hand. \u201cCome on, you, me, a platter of barely seared meat...it\u2019ll be great. If we see the necromancers, we can make fun of the way they hold their forks.\u201d</p><p>We got out of the car and headed inside. The bloodsuckers glanced at us in unison, their eyes like two smoldering coals buried beneath the ash of a dying fire. I felt their minds, twin hot pinpoints of pain, restrained securely by the navigators\u2019 wills. One slipup and those coals would ignite into an all-consuming flame. Vampires never knew satiation. They never got full, they never stopped killing, and if let loose, they would drown the world in blood and die of starvation when there was nothing left to kill.</p><p>The chains wouldn\u2019t hold them\u2014the links were an eighth of an inch thick at best, good for restraining a large dog. A vamp would snap it and not even notice, but the general public felt better if the bloodsuckers were chained, and so the navigators obliged.</p><p>We passed the vampires and entered the restaurant.</p><p>The inside of Arirang was dim. Feylanterns glowed with soft light on the walls, as the charged air inside their colored glass tubes reacted with magic. Each feylantern had been handblown into a beautiful shape: a bright blue dragon, an emerald tortoise, a purple fish, a turquoise stocky dog with a unicorn horn...Booths lined the walls, their tables plain rectangles of wood. In the center of the floor four larger round tables sported built-in charcoal grills under metal hoods.</p><p>The restaurant was about half full. The two booths to our right were occupied, the first by a young couple, a dark-haired man and a blond woman in their twenties, and the second by two middle-aged men. The younger couple chatted quietly. Good clothes, relaxed, casual, well groomed. Ten to one these were the navigators who had parked the bloodsuckers out front. The People\u2019s headquarters, known as the Casino, had seven Masters of the Dead and I knew them all by sight. I didn\u2019t recognize either the man or the woman. Either these two were visiting from out of town or they were upper-level journeymen.</p><p>Both of the older guys in the next booth were armed. The closer one carried a short sword, which he had put on the seat next to him. As his friend reached for the salt shaker, his sweatshirt hugged the gun in his side holster.</p><p>Past the men in the far right corner, four women in their thirties laughed too loud\u2014probably tipsy. On the other side a family with two teenage daughters cooked their food on the grill. The older girl looked a bit like Julie, my ward. Two businesswomen, another family with a toddler, and an older couple rounded off the patrons. No threats.</p><p>The air swirled with the delicious aroma of meat cooked over an open fire, saut\u00e9ed garlic, and sweet spices. My mouth watered. I hadn\u2019t eaten since grabbing some bread this morning from a street vendor. My stomach actually hurt.</p><p>A waiter in plain black pants and a black T-shirt led us to a table in the middle of the floor. Curran and I took chairs opposite one another, where I could see the back door and he had a nice view of the front entrance. We ordered hot tea. Thirty seconds later it arrived with a plate of pot stickers.</p><p>\u201cHungry?\u201d Curran asked.</p><p>\u201cStarving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCombination platter for four,\u201d Curran ordered.</p><p>His hungry and my hungry were two completely different things.</p><p>The waiter departed.</p><p>Curran smiled. It was a happy, genuine smile and it catapulted him from attractive into irresistible territory. He didn\u2019t smile very often in public. That intimate smile was usually reserved for private moments when we were alone.</p><p>I pulled the band off my still-damp braid and slid my fingers through it, unraveling the hair. Curran\u2019s gaze snagged on my hands. He focused on my fingers like a cat on a piece of foil pulled by a string. I shook my head and my hair fell over my shoulders in a long dark wave. There we go. Now we were both private in public.</p><p>Tiny gold sparks danced in Curran\u2019s gray irises. He was thinking dirty thoughts and the wicked edge in his smile made me want to slide over next to him and touch him.</p><p>We had to wait. I was pretty sure that having hot sex on the floor of Arirang would get us banned for life. Then again, it might be worth it.</p><p>I raised my tea in a salute. \u201cTo our date.\u201d</p><p>He raised his cup and we clinked them gently against each other.</p><p>\u201cSo how was your day?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cFirst, I chased a giant jellyfish around through some suburbs. Then I argued with Biohazard about coming and picking it up, because they claimed it was a Fish and Game issue. Then I called Fish and Game and conferenced them in on the Biohazard call, and then I got to listen to the two of them argue and call each other names. They got really creative.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen Jim called,\u201d Curran said.</p><p>I grimaced. \u201cYes. That, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there a particular reason you\u2019re avoiding our chief of security?\u201d Curran asked.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember how my aunt killed the head of the Mercenary Guild?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNot something one forgets,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThe Guild is still squabbling over who should be in charge now.\u201d</p><p>Curran glanced at me. \u201cThat was what, five months ago?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy point exactly. On one side there are the older mercs, who have combat experience. The other side is the support staff. Both groups have roughly an equal share of the Guild as a result of Solomon\u2019s will and they hate each other. It\u2019s getting into death threat territory, so they\u2019re having some sort of final arbitration to decide who\u2019s in charge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept they are deadlocked,\u201d Curran guessed.</p><p>\u201cYes, they are. Apparently Jim thinks I should break that tie.\u201d</p><p>The Guild\u2019s now-dead founder was a closet shapeshifter, and he had left twenty percent of the Guild to the Pack. So as long as the Mercenary Guild remained deadlocked, nobody was getting paid and the Pack alphas wanted that income stream to start flowing again. They put pressure on Jim, and Jim put pressure on me.</p><p>I had done enough years in the Guild to be viewed as a veteran. Jim had as well, but unlike me, he had the luxury of having kept his identity semi-private. Most mercs didn\u2019t know he was high up in the Pack.</p> <p>I had no privacy. I was the Beast Lord\u2019s Consort. It was the price I paid for being with Curran, but I didn\u2019t have to like it.</p><p>His Majesty drank his tea. \u201cNot looking forward to settling the dispute?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather eat dirt. It\u2019s between Mark, Solomon\u2019s longtime assistant, and the veterans led by the Four Horsemen, and they despise each other. They aren\u2019t interested in reaching a consensus. They just want to throw mud at each other over a conference table.\u201d</p><p>An evil light sparked in his eyes. \u201cYou could always go for Plan B.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPound everyone to a bloody pulp until they shut up and cooperate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p> <p>It would make me feel better. \u201cI could always do it your way instead.\u201d</p><p>Curran raised his blond eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cRoar until everyone pees themselves.\u201d</p><p>A shadow of self-satisfaction flickered on his face and vanished, replaced by innocence. \u201cThat\u2019s bullshit. I\u2019m perfectly reasonable and I almost never roar. I don\u2019t even remember what it feels like to knock some heads together.\u201d</p><p>The Beast Lord of Atlanta, a gentle and enlightened monarch. \u201cHow progressive of you, Your Majesty.\u201d</p><p>He cracked another grin.</p><p>The male necromancer in the booth next to us reached under the table and produced a rectangular rosewood box. Ten to one, there was some sort of jewelry inside.</p><p>I nodded at Curran. \u201cYour turn. How did your day go?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt was busy and full of stupid shit I didn\u2019t want to deal with.\u201d</p><p>The blond woman opened the box. Her eyes lit up.</p><p>\u201cThe rats are having some sort of internal dispute over some apartments they bought. Took all day to untangle it.\u201d Curran shrugged.</p><p>The woman plucked a golden necklace from the box. Shaped like an inch-and-a-half-wide segmented collar of pale gold, it gleamed in the feylantern light.</p><p>I poured us more tea. \u201cBut you prevailed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Curran drank from his cup. \u201cYou know, we could stay over in the city tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause that way we wouldn\u2019t have to drive for an hour back to the Keep before we could fool around.\u201d</p><p>Heh.</p><p>A scream jerked me to my feet. In the booth, the blond necromancer clawed at the necklace, gasping for breath. The man stared at her, his face a terrified mask. The woman raked her throat, gouging flesh. With a dried pop, her neck snapped, and she crashed to the floor. The man dived down, pulling at the necklace. \u201cAmanda! Oh my God!\u201d</p><p>Past him two pairs of red vampire eyes stared at us through the window.</p><p>Oh crap. I pulled Slayer from the sheath on my back. Sensing the undead, the pale blade of the enchanted saber glowed, sending wisps of white vapor into the air.</p><p>The dull carmine glow of vampire irises flared into vivid scarlet. Shit. The restaurant had just updated its menu with fresh human.</p><p>Flesh boiled on Curran\u2019s arms. Bone grew, muscle twisted like slick ropes, skin sheathed his new body and sprouted fur. Enormous claws slid from Curran\u2019s new fingers.</p><p>The vampires rose off their haunches.</p><p>Curran stood up next to me in his warrior form, nearly eight feet of steel-hard muscle.</p><p>I gripped Slayer\u2019s hilt, feeling the familiar comforting texture. Bloodsuckers reacted to sudden movement, bright lights, loud noises, anything that telegraphed prey. Whatever I did had to be fast and flashy. The blood alone wouldn\u2019t do it, not when every table was filled with raw meat.</p><p>The front window exploded in a cascade of gleaming shards, and the vampires sailed through, like they had wings. The left bloodsucker landed on the table, the remnant of the chain hanging from its neck. The right skidded on the slick parquet floor and bumped into another table, scattering the chairs.</p><p>I screamed and dashed to the left, pulling Slayer as I sprinted. Curran snarled and leaped, covering half the distance to the right bloodsucker in a single powerful jump.</p><p>My vamp glared at me. I looked into its eyes.</p><p>Hunger.</p><p>Like staring into an ancient abyss. Behind the eyes, its mind seethed, free of its master\u2019s control. I wanted to reach out and crush it, like a bug between my fingernails. But doing that would give me away. I might as well give the People a sample of my blood with a pretty bow on it.</p><p>\u201cHere!\u201d I flicked my wrist, making the reflection of feylanterns dance along Slayer\u2019s surface. Look. Shiny.</p><p>The bloodsucker\u2019s gaze locked on the blade. The vamp ducked down, like a dog before the strike, front limbs wide, yellow claws digging into the table. The wood groaned. The chain slipped along the table\u2019s edge, clinking.</p><p>No way to make a neck cut. The chain loop would block the blade.</p><p>A high-pitched female scream slashed my eardrums. The vamp hissed, jerking in the direction of the sound.</p><p>I jumped on the chair next to the table and thrust sideways and up. Slayer\u2019s blade slid between the vamp\u2019s ribs. The tip met a tight resistance and then sliced through it. Hit the heart. Banzai!</p><p>The bloodsucker screeched. I let go of the saber. The vamp reared, Slayer buried up to the hilt in its rib cage, staggered as if drunk, pitched over, and crashed to the floor, flopping like a fish on dry land.</p><p>To the left, Curran thrust his claws through the flesh under his vamp\u2019s chin. The bloody tips of the talons emerged from the back of the bloodsucker\u2019s neck. The vamp clawed at him. Curran thrust his monstrous hand deeper, gripped the vamp\u2019s neck and tore its head off the body.</p><p>Show-off.</p><p>He tossed the head aside and glanced at me, checking if I was okay. The whole thing had only taken about five seconds, but it felt like an eternity. We were both in one piece. I exhaled.</p><p>The restaurant fell silent, except for the male necromancer sobbing on the floor and the hoarse hissing coming from the vampire, convulsing as my saber liquefied its innards, absorbing the nutrients into the blade.</p><p>In the far corner a man swiped his toddler from the high chair, grabbed his wife\u2019s hand, and ran out. As one, the patrons jumped. Chairs fell, feet pounded, someone gasped. They rushed out of both doors. In a blink the place was empty.</p><p>I grasped Slayer and pulled. It slid from the body with ease. The edges of the wound sagged apart and dark brown blood spilled out from the cut. I swung and beheaded the vamp with a single sharp stroke. You should always finish what you started. I wiped Slayer off and put it back in its sheath.</p><p>Curran\u2019s arms shrank, streamlining, gray fur melting into his skin. A normal shapeshifter would\u2019ve needed a nap after changing shape twice in such a short time, but Curran didn\u2019t exactly play by the regular shapeshifter rules. He walked over to the male necromancer, pulled him upright, and shook him once, an expression of deep contempt on his face. I could almost hear the guy\u2019s teeth rattle in his skull.</p><p>\u201cLook at me. Focus.\u201d</p><p>The necromancer stared at him, shocked eyes wide, his mouth slack.</p><p>I knelt by the female navigator and touched her wrist, keeping away from her neck and the gold band on it. No pulse. The necklace clamped her throat like a golden noose, its color a dark vivid yellow, almost orange. The skin around it was bright red and quickly turning purple.</p><p>I picked up her purse, pulled out a wallet, and snapped it open. A People ID. Amanda Sunny, journeywoman, Second Tier. Twenty years old and now dead.</p><p>Curran peered into the journeyman\u2019s face. \u201cWhat happened? What did you do?\u201d</p><p>The man sucked in a deep breath and dissolved into tears.</p><p>Curran dropped him in disgust. His eyes were pure gold\u2014he was pissed off.</p><p>I went to the hostess desk and found the phone. Please work, sometimes even when the magic was up phones would. Dial tone. Yes!</p><p>I called the Casino.</p><p>\u201cKate Daniels, for Ghastek. Urgent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease wait,\u201d female voice said. The phone went silent. I hummed to myself and looked at the ID. I didn\u2019t know which of the Masters of the Dead Amanda answered to, but I knew Ghastek was the best of the seven currently in the city. He was also power hungry and he was making his bid for taking over the People\u2019s Atlanta office. He was very much in the limelight at the moment and I could count on a rapid response.</p><p>A moment passed. Another.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, Kate?\u201d Ghastek\u2019s voice said into the phone. He must\u2019ve been doing something, because he failed to keep exasperation from his voice. \u201cPlease make this quick, I\u2019m in the middle of something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have one dead journeywoman, one hysterical journeyman, two dead vampires, one pissed-off Beast Lord with bloody hands, and a half a dozen terrified restaurant staff.\u201d Quick enough for you?</p><p>Ghastek\u2019s voice snapped into a brisk tone. \u201cWhere are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cArirang on Greenpine. Bring a decontamination unit and body bags.\u201d</p><p>I hung up. Our waiter edged out of the doors and approached our table, looking green. The rest of the staff was probably huddled together in the back room, terrified, not knowing if the danger had passed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIs it over?\u201d</p><p>Curran turned to him. \u201cYes, it\u2019s over. The People are on their way to clean up the mess. You can bring everyone out, if it will make them feel better. We guarantee your safety.\u201d</p><p>The waiter took off. Someone shouted. A moment later the front doors opened and people poured out: an older Korean man, the older woman who had greeted us, a woman who looked like she could be their daughter, and several men and women in waiter and chef garb. The younger woman carried a boy. He couldn\u2019t have been more than five.</p> <p>The owners piled up into the booths around us. The boy stared at the two vampires with dark eyes, big like two cherries.</p><p>I sat into the chair next to Curran. He reached over and pulled me close. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay.\u201d I stared at the dead woman. Twenty years old. She\u2019d barely had a chance to live. I\u2019d seen a lot of death, but for some reason the sight of Amanda lying there on the floor, her boyfriend weeping uncontrollably by her body, chilled me to the bone. I leaned against Curran, feeling the heat of his body seep through my T-shirt. I was so cold and I really needed his warmth.</p><p>CHAPTER 2</p><p>A caravan of black SUVs rolled into the parking lot, their enchanted water engines belching noise. Magic-powered cars didn\u2019t move very fast and sounded like a rock avalanche hitting a speeding train, but they were better than nothing.</p> <p>We watched the SUVs through the broken window, as they parked at the far end, killed the noise, and vomited people, vampires, and body bags. Ghastek emerged from the lead vehicle, ridiculously out of place in a black turtleneck and tailored dark pants. He came through the door, surveyed the scene for a second, and headed to us.</p><p>Curran\u2019s eyes darkened. \u201cI bet you a dollar he\u2019s running over to assure me that we\u2019re in no danger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a sucker\u2019s bet.\u201d</p><p>The Pack and the People existed in a very fragile state of peace. None of us wanted to do anything to jeopardize that.</p><p>The People were efficient, I gave them that. One crew went for the vampires, the other headed for the woman\u2019s body, the third for the despondent journeyman. Two women and a man in business suits made a beeline for the booth where the owners sat.</p><p>Ghastek came close enough to be heard. \u201cI want it to be clear: this was not an attempt to kill either of you. The journeymen weren\u2019t supposed to be here and the guilty party will be harshly reprimanded.\u201d</p> <p>Curran shrugged. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Ghastek. If this was an attempt, I know you\u2019d bring more than two vampires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Ghastek asked.</p><p>\u201cThey were having dinner,\u201d I told him. \u201cThey seemed happy together. The boy handed her a necklace and it choked her to death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust so I understand, Lawrence himself wasn\u2019t personally injured?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Curran said. \u201cHe\u2019s in shock from watching his girlfriend die in front of him.\u201d</p><p>Ghastek looked over the scene again, looking like he wanted to be anywhere but here. \u201cOnce again, we\u2019re dreadfully sorry for the inconvenience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll live,\u201d Curran said.</p><p>One of the People stepped away from Amanda\u2019s body. \u201cThe necklace adhered to her skin. There doesn\u2019t appear to be any locking mechanism. It\u2019s a solid band of gold.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLeave it,\u201d Ghastek said. \u201cWe\u2019ll remove it later.\u201d</p><p>If I were them, I\u2019d cut it off during tech and stick it into a hazmat container.</p><p>A middle-aged man shouldered his way inside the restaurant, followed by a young woman and a boy who looked about seven. I glanced at the woman and had to click my mouth shut. She looked to be in her late teens, right on the cusp between a girl and a woman. Her body, full in the bust and hips, slimmed to a narrow waist. Her long slender legs carried her with a natural grace. Her hair streamed from her head in a shimmering cascade so precisely matching the color of gold, I would\u2019ve sworn it was gold if I didn\u2019t know better. Her face, a pale oval, was angelic. She glanced at me in passing. Her irises were an intense deep blue and her eyes were decades older than her face.</p><p>She was beautiful.</p><p>She was also not human. Or she had bargained with something not human for that body.</p><p>Curran was watching her. His nostrils flared a little as he inhaled, sampling the scents and I felt a punch of jealousy right in the gut. Well, this was a new and unwelcome development.</p><p>Ghastek focused on the woman as well, with the kind of clinical interest usually afforded to an odd insect. \u201cHere come the grieving parents. I\u2019ve met them before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that her sister?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s Mrs. Aurellia Sunny, her mother. The boy is Amanda\u2019s brother.\u201d</p><p>Not human.</p><p>The middle-aged man saw the female navigator, whose body the People had just loaded on the gurney. \u201cAmanda! Jesus Christ, Amanda! Baby!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Aurellia cried out.</p><p>He dashed to Amanda. \u201cOh God. Oh God.\u201d</p><p>His wife chased after him, the boy in tow. \u201cDon\u2019t go near her!\u201d</p><p>The man grasped Amanda\u2019s hand. The golden band of the necklace popped open. An eerie soft light ignited within the necklace, setting the gold aglow.</p><p>\u201cOh Go\u2014\u201d Amanda\u2019s father fell silent in the middle of the word, transfixed by the necklace.</p><p>His hand inched toward it.</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d Curran barked. The man froze, arrested by the unmistakable command in that voice.</p><p>I was already moving.</p><p>The golden-haired woman pushed past him, yanked the necklace from Amanda\u2019s neck, spun, and thrust it at the boy\u2019s throat. The gold band locked on the child\u2019s neck, adhering to his skin. I missed it by half a second.</p><p>The boy gasped but didn\u2019t die. His father shook his head, as if awakened from a dream.</p><p>Aurellia stared at me with her old eyes and smiled.</p><p>\u201cAre you out of your mind?\u201d I snarled. \u201cThat necklace just killed your daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t your affair,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cTake it off. Now.\u201d Before it kills again.</p><p>She sneered. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She knew exactly what that necklace did. She had made a conscious choice between her husband and her son.</p><p>The boy dug his fingers into his neck, trying to pry the necklace loose. It remained stuck. The skin around the band of gold was turning pink. We had to get that thing off of him.</p><p>The man stared at her. \u201cAurellia? What\u2019s going on? What\u2019s the meaning of this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d the woman told him. \u201cI\u2019ll explain it later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019ll explain it now.\u201d Curran moved next to me.</p><p>\u201cI have to concur,\u201d Ghastek said.</p><p>The woman raised her chin. \u201cYou have no authority over me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAurellia, what is going on?\u201d her husband asked.</p><p>\u201cOn the contrary. We have all the authority we need.\u201d Ghastek snapped his fingers. A woman in a business suit and glasses popped up by his side as if by magic.</p><p>\u201cThe necklace caused the death of a journeywoman in our employ,\u201d the woman said. \u201cWe\u2019ve expended a considerable amount of money in training her, not to mention the cost of the two vampires that were terminated as a result of her death. That necklace is evidence in our investigation of the incident. If you obstruct our investigation by withholding this evidence from us, we will obtain a court order requiring you to surrender the necklace to us. Should we choose to pursue this matter further, you will find yourself in a very actionable position.\u201d</p><p>Some people had attack dogs. Ghastek had attack lawyers. If he got his hands on the boy, he\u2019d find a way to remove the necklace. Even if he had to behead the child to get it.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t let the People get the boy.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s nice,\u201d I said. \u201cI have a simpler solution. Take the necklace off the child now and I won\u2019t kill you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait a God-damned minute.\u201d Amanda\u2019s father moved to stand between me and his wife. \u201cEveryone calm down. Just calm down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me the boy and nobody gets hurt,\u201d I told them. \u201cNobody here will stop me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat child is wearing our evidence,\u201d Ghastek said.</p><p>Curran\u2019s eyes lit up with gold. He leveled his alpha stare on the woman. She flinched.</p><p>\u201cGive me the child,\u201d Curran said, his voice a deep inhuman growl.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Aurellia shoved the boy toward us. \u201cTake him.\u201d</p><p>Curran swept the boy off the floor and picked him up. Ghastek\u2019s face fell. We\u2019d won this round.</p><p>\u201cGive me back my son!\u201d the man demanded.</p><p>Curran just looked at him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s in the boy\u2019s best interests that he stay in our custody,\u201d Ghastek said. \u201cWe have better facilities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the quality of your facilities I doubt,\u201d Curran said. \u201cIt\u2019s your ethics and your intentions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is that supposed to mean?\u201d Ghastek narrowed his eyes.</p><p>\u201cIt means the necklace is more important to you than the boy,\u201d I said. \u201cYou\u2019ll slice the flesh off his neck to get it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a gross exaggeration.\u201d The Master of the Dead crossed his arms. \u201cI\u2019ve never murdered a child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s never murder when you do it,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s a regrettable accidental casualty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t do this!\u201d Amanda\u2019s father thrust himself before Curran. \u201cYou can\u2019t take my son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I can,\u201d Curran said. \u201cWe\u2019ll keep him safe. If your wife decides to explain what\u2019s going on, I\u2019ll consider returning him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo fuck yourself,\u201d the golden-haired woman said. \u201cCrawl back into whatever dark hole you came out of. I have no care for you or your kind.\u201d She turned and walked out of the restaurant.</p><p>Her husband froze, caught for a moment between his son and his wife. \u201cThis isn\u2019t over,\u201d he said finally and chased after Aurellia. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGive us the boy,\u201d Ghastek said, his tone reasonable.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d Curran said. \u201cIf you want to examine him later, you\u2019re welcome to visit the Keep.\u201d</p><p>Around us the People tensed. In the corner two vampires leaned forward.</p> <p>I unsheathed Slayer. I had a lot of practice and I did it fast. The lawyer woman jerked back. The opaque blade smoked, sensing the undead. Come on, Ghastek. Make our night.</p><p>Ghastek sighed. \u201cFine. I\u2019ll make the necessary arrangements later.\u201d</p><p>Curran headed out through the door. I waited a second and followed, walking backward for the first two steps to make sure that no undead would come leaping out of the darkness at Curran\u2019s back.</p><p>The door of the restaurant swung shut behind us. Ghastek\u2019s voice called out, \u201cAlright, people, back to work. Let\u2019s process the scene tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d Curran asked.</p> <p>The boy swallowed. \u201cRoderick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid,\u201d Curran told him, his voice still laced with snarls. \u201cI\u2019ll keep you safe. If anything threatens you, I\u2019ll kill it.\u201d</p><p>The boy gulped.</p><p>A giant scary man with glowing eyes and an inhuman voice just took you from your parents, but don\u2019t be afraid, because he\u2019ll kill anything that moves. Kick-ass calming strategy, Your Majesty.</p><p>\u201cHe might be less scared if you stopped snarling and turned off the headlights,\u201d I murmured.</p><p>The fire in Curran\u2019s eyes died.</p> <p>\u201cIt will be okay,\u201d I told Roderick. \u201cWe just want to take off that necklace, and then you can go back to your parents. It\u2019ll be alright, I promise.\u201d</p><p>If the necklace snapped his neck, there wasn\u2019t a damn thing I or Curran or anybody else could do about it. We had to get him to the Keep\u2019s infirmary right away. We drove there in silence.</p><p>CHAPTER 3</p><p>Doolittle bent over the boy, studying the necklace with a magnifying glass. Dark-skinned, his hair salted with gray, the Pack medic looked to be in his early fifties. Doolittle was the best medmage I had ever met. He had brought me back from the edge of death so many times, we\u2019d stopped joking about it.</p><p>There was something so soothing about Doolittle. Whether it was his manner, his kind eyes, or the soft Southern accent, tinted with notes of coastal Georgia, I didn\u2019t know. The moment he walked into the room, Roderick relaxed. In thirty seconds they had struck a bargain: if Roderick stayed on his best behavior, he would get ice cream.</p><p>Not that Roderick had to be bribed. It took us almost an hour to get to the Keep and the entire ride over, he did not say a single word. He didn\u2019t move, didn\u2019t fidget, or do any of the normal things a seven-year-old kid would do in the car. He just sat there, quiet, his brown eyes opened wide, like he was a baby owl.</p><p>Doolittle pressed his thumb and index finger just above the necklace, stretching the boy\u2019s skin. A vein stood out, burrowing from the gold band under his skin into the muscle of his neck like a thin root.</p><p>\u201cDoes it hurt when I press here?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d Roderick said. His voice was barely above a whisper.</p><p>Doolittle probed a different spot. \u201cAnd now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>The medmage let go and patted Roderick\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI do believe we\u2019re done for tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIce cream now?\u201d Roderick asked, his voice quiet.</p><p>\u201cIce cream now,\u201d Doolittle confirmed. \u201cLena!\u201d</p><p>A female shapeshifter stuck her red head into the room.</p><p>\u201cThis young gentleman is in need of ice cream,\u201d Doolittle said. \u201cHe\u2019s earned it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh boy!\u201d Lena made big eyes and held out her hand. \u201cI better pay up, then. Come on.\u201d</p><p>Roderick hopped off the chair and took her hand very carefully.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of ice cream would you like?\u201d Lena asked, leading him through the doorway.</p><p>\u201cChocolate,\u201d the boy said quietly, with a slight hesitation in his voice.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got loads of chocolate...\u201d</p><p>The door swung shut behind them.</p><p>Doolittle looked at the door and sighed. \u201cThe necklace is rooted in the sternomastoid. If I try to remove it surgically, he\u2019ll bleed out. You said his mother put this atrocity on him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Curran said.</p><p>\u201cThe collar glowed when the husband came near,\u201d I said. \u201cHe was reaching out for it and she yanked it away from him and snapped it on the boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it was probably intended for her husband,\u201d Doolittle said.</p><p>\u201cThat, or it\u2019s an equal opportunity offender,\u201d I said. \u201cAny neck will do and the boy was the closest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it killed the girl instantly?\u201d Doolittle asked.</p><p>\u201cPretty much,\u201d Curran said.</p><p>\u201cStrange. It doesn\u2019t seem to be actively harming the boy at the moment beyond rooting in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it hurt him?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t appear so.\u201d Doolittle leaned against the chair. \u201cI poked and prodded at it a bit. It seems that the \u2018roots\u2019 shift under pressure so any attempt to cut the necklace will likely cause it to contract and strangle him. I don\u2019t want to fool with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe woman,\u201d Curran said, \u201cshe knew better than to touch it.\u201d</p><p>I thought out loud. \u201cShe was unaffected by the glow, so either she\u2019s immune or she knows how it works.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe boy didn\u2019t cry when you took him from his mother?\u201d Doolittle asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said.</p><p>The medmage glanced at the door again. \u201cThe child is very passive and compliant. He doesn\u2019t speak unless spoken to. He doesn\u2019t take initiative. This boy is doing his best to be invisible. Sometimes this is a sign of a shy nature. Sometimes it\u2019s a sign of emotional abuse or neglect.\u201d Doolittle crossed his arms. \u201cSuch an accusation can\u2019t be made lightly. This is just something to keep in mind in dealing with her. If she is emotionally distant, she may not have any attachment to him. Let me run some tests. The sooner we identify what the necklace is, the better.\u201d</p><p>We left the infirmary and walked down the long hallway, heading toward the stairway leading up to the top of the tower, to our rooms. The Keep\u2019s hours were skewed toward the night. For most people ten p.m. meant evening and probably bedtime\u2014both electricity and the charged air that powered feylanterns were expensive and people tended to make the most of daylight. For shapeshifters ten p.m. was closer to four in the afternoon. The hallways were busy. Random shapeshifters ducked their heads as we passed them.</p><p>Something had occurred to me. \u201cWhen the journeyman handed Amanda the necklace, did it seem paler to you?\u201d</p><p>Curran frowned. \u201cYes. Almost white gold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now it\u2019s almost orange.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think it feeds on the host?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would make sense. Maybe it develops hunger. The girl died instantly, because the necklace was hungry. Now it\u2019s satiated, so it\u2019s biding its time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll need to talk to the journeyman,\u201d Curran said. \u201cAnd the boy\u2019s mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, the woman. The supernaturally beautiful woman with long flowing hair...Can\u2019t forget her.\u201d</p><p>Curran turned his head to look at me.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019d like to know.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ll speak to the journeyman tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come with you.\u201d</p><p>And why would he want to do that? I pictured trying to conduct an interview in the presence of the Beast Lord. The journeyman would take one look at him and run for the hills screaming.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou always say that word,\u201d he said. \u201cIs it supposed to mean something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means I don\u2019t want you to come with me. The moment you muscle your way into the room, he\u2019ll clam up out of sheer self-preservation. Let me handle this.\u201d</p><p>We started up the stairway. Our quarters were at the very top and I really could\u2019ve used an elevator right about now.</p><p>Curran kept his voice even. \u201cSomehow I have managed to deal with the People just fine for almost fifteen years without your help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I recall, you almost had yourself a war. And I won\u2019t be dealing with the People. I\u2019ll be dealing with one specific journeyman, facing sanctions and scared out of his mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you think you\u2019ll be able to get anywhere near Ghastek without me, you\u2019re crazy,\u201d Curran said.</p><p>I stopped and looked at him. \u201cI will take my boudas and personal guard, dress them in black, put them on horses, and ride up to the Casino. Then I will pick the scariest-looking shapeshifter in the bunch and send him in to announce that the Consort seeks an audience. Do you really think the People will keep me waiting for long?\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s good that we didn\u2019t have any kindling or paper around or the sparks flying from our butting heads would set the Keep on fire. We were both tired and pissed off.</p><p>Above us Jim rounded the corner on the landing and came to a dead stop, obviously wondering if he could get away with turning on his foot and going back the way he\u2019d come without our noticing. Curran turned to face him.</p><p>That\u2019s right, you\u2019re busted.</p><p>Jim sighed and headed toward us at a brisk pace.</p><p>Tall, his skin the color of rich coffee, and dressed all in black, Jim looked like he was carved from a block of solid muscle. Logic said that at some point he must\u2019ve been a baby and then a child, but looking at him one was almost convinced that some deity had touched the ground with its scepter and proclaimed, \u201cThere shall be a badass,\u201d and Jim had sprung into existence, fully formed, complete with clothes, and ready for action. He was the alpha of Clan Cat, the Pack\u2019s chief of security, and Curran\u2019s best friend.</p><p>He braked near us.</p><p>\u201cHave you vetted the Wolves of the Isle yet?\u201d Curran asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are the Wolves of the Isle?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a small pack from the Florida Keys,\u201d Curran said. \u201cEight people. They\u2019re petitioning to join us and for some odd reason our security chief is dragging his feet on the background checks.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jim waved the stack of paper in his hand. \u201cThe security chief has two thefts, four murders, and an abandonment of post to deal with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMurders?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Jim nodded.</p> <p>\u201cI gave my word to the wolves,\u201d Curran said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not opposed to admitting them.\u201d Jim spread his arms. \u201cAll I\u2019m saying is let me make sure the people we have are safe before we add any more to them. By the way, Kate, did you review the Guild documents I sent you?\u201d</p><p>Deflecting attention, are we? I gave him my tough stare. It bounced off Jim like hail from the pavement. \u201cSomewhat. I was busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee?\u201d Jim pointed to me. \u201cYour mate is doing the same thing I\u2019m doing. Prioritizing.\u201d</p><p>I would get him for this. Oh yes.</p> <p>Curran looked at Jim. \u201cDo you need my help with the background checks?\u201d</p><p>A muscle in Jim\u2019s face jerked. \u201cNo, I\u2019ve got it.\u201d</p><p>Ha! He didn\u2019t want Curran in his hair either. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, he\u2019s coming with me to investigate things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the city?\u201d Jim asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a great idea. You both should go. To the city.\u201d</p> <p>Curran and I looked at each other.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s trying to get rid of us,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cYou think he\u2019s planning a coup?\u201d Curran wondered.</p><p>\u201cI hope so.\u201d I turned to Jim. \u201cIs there any chance you\u2019d overthrow the tyrannical Beast Lord and his psychotic Consort?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I want a vacation,\u201d Curran said.</p><p>Jim leaned toward us and said in a lowered voice, \u201cYou couldn\u2019t pay me enough. This is your mess, you deal with it. I have enough on my plate.\u201d</p><p>He walked away.</p><p>\u201cToo bad,\u201d Curran said.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, I think we could convince him to seize the reins of power.\u201d</p><p>Curran shook his head. \u201cNah. He\u2019s too smart for that.\u201d</p><p>We finally made it up the stairs, through the long hallway, up the second flight, and into our quarters. I dropped my bag down, shrugged out of my sword and scabbard and took a deep breath. Aahh, home.</p><p>Generally, tackling someone from behind is very effective, because the person doesn\u2019t know you\u2019re coming. However, after being tackled a dozen times, the victim becomes accustomed to it. Which is why when Curran made a grab for me, I danced aside and tripped him. He grabbed my arm, then we did some rolling on the floor, and I ended up on top of him, our noses about an inch apart.</p><p>He grinned. \u201cYou\u2019re jealous.\u201d</p><p>I considered it. \u201cNo. But when you stared at that woman like she was made of diamonds, it didn\u2019t feel very good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI stared at her because she smelled strange.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStrange how?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe smelled like rock dust. Very strong dry smell.\u201d Curran put his arms around me. \u201cI love it when you get all fussy and possessive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never get fussy and possessive.\u201d</p><p>He grinned, showing his teeth. His face was practically glowing. \u201cSo you\u2019re cool if I go over and chat her up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Are you cool if I go and chat up that sexy werewolf on the third floor?\u201d</p><p>He went from casual and funny to deadly serious in half a blink. \u201cWhat sexy werewolf?\u201d</p><p>I laughed.</p><p>Curran\u2019s eyes focused. He was concentrating on something.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re taking a mental inventory of all the people working on the third floor, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>His expression went blank. I\u2019d hit the nail on the head.</p><p>I slid off him and put my head on his biceps. The shaggy carpet was nice and comfortable under my back.</p><p>\u201cIs it Jordan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just picked a random floor,\u201d I told him. \u201cYou\u2019re nuts, you know that?\u201d</p><p>He put his arm around me. \u201cLook who\u2019s talking.\u201d</p><p>We lay together on the carpet.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t let the necklace kill that boy,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll do everything we can.\u201d He sighed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBest date ever. Well, until people died and vampires showed up. But before that it was awesome.\u201d</p><p>We lay there some more.</p><p>\u201cWe should go to bed.\u201d Curran stretched next to me. \u201cExcept the carpet is nice and soft and I\u2019m tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me to carry you?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cThink you can?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Do you want to find out?\u201d</p><p>It turned out that carrying him to our bed wasn\u2019t necessary. He got there on his own power and he wasn\u2019t nearly as tired as he\u2019d claimed to be.</p><p>Morning brought a call from Doolittle. When we arrived at the medward, Roderick was sitting on the cot, the same owlish expression on his face. The necklace had lost some of its yellow tint during the night. Now it looked slightly darker than orange rind.</p><p>I crouched by the boy. \u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>Roderick looked at me with his big eyes. \u201cGood morning.\u201d</p><p>His voice was weak. In my mind the necklace constricted around his fragile neck. The bone crunched...</p><p>We had to get a move on. We had to get it off him.</p><p>Doolittle led us toward the door and spoke quietly. \u201cThere is a definite change in the color of the metal. He\u2019s beginning to experience discomfort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo that thing is getting hungry,\u201d Curran said.</p><p>\u201cProbably.\u201d Doolittle held up a small printout. A pale blue stripe cut across the paper. The m-scan. The m-scanner recorded specific types of magic as different colors: purple for the undead, green for shapeshifter, and so on. Blue stood for plain human magic\u2014mages, telepaths, and telekinetics all registered blue. It was the basic human default.</p><p>\u201cIs that the necklace or Roderick?\u201d Curran asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the boy. He has power and it\u2019s obscuring whatever magic signature the necklace is giving out.\u201d Doolittle pointed to a point on the graph. I squinted. A series of paler sparks punctured the blue.</p><p>\u201cThis is probably the necklace,\u201d Doolittle said. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough to go on. We need a more precise measurement.\u201d</p><p>We needed Julie. She was a sensate\u2014she saw the colors of magic with more precision than any m-scanner. I stuck my head out into the hallway and called, \u201cCould someone find my kid, please, and ask her to come down here?\u201d</p><p>Five minutes later, Julie entered the medward. When I\u2019d first found her, she\u2019d been half-starved, skinny, and had had anxiety attacks if the protective layer of grime was removed from her skin. Now at fourteen, she had progressed from skinny to lean. Her legs and arms showed definition if she flexed. She was meticulously clean, but recently had decided that the invention of brushes was unnecessary and a waste of time, so her blond hair looked like a cross between a rough haystack and a bird\u2019s nest.</p><p>I explained about the necklace. Julie approached the boy. \u201cHey. I\u2019m going to look at the thing on your neck, okay?\u201d</p><p>Roderick said nothing.</p><p>Julie peered at the metal. \u201cOdd. It\u2019s pale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPale yellow? Pale green?\u201d Any tint was good.</p><p>\u201cNo. It looks colorless, like hot air rising from the pavement.\u201d</p><p>Transparent magic. Now I had seen everything.</p><p>\u201cThere are very faint runes on it,\u201d Julie said, \u201chard to make out. I\u2019m not surprised you missed them,\u201d she added.</p><p>\u201cCan you read them?\u201d Curran asked.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cIt\u2019s not any runic alphabet I was taught.\u201d</p><p>Doolittle handed her a piece of paper and a pencil and she wrote five symbols on it. Runes, the ancient letters of Old Norse and Germanic alphabets, had undergone several changes over the years, but the oldest runes owed their straight up-and-down appearance to the fact that historically they had to be carved on a hard surface: all straight lines, no curves, no tiny strokes. These symbols definitely fit that pattern, but they didn\u2019t look like any runes I\u2019d seen. I could spend a day or two digging through books, but Roderick didn\u2019t have that long. We needed information fast.</p><p>Curran must\u2019ve come to the same conclusion. \u201cDo we know any rune experts?\u201d</p><p>I tapped the paper. \u201cI can make some calls. There is a guy\u2014Dagfinn Heyerdahl. He used to be with the Norse Heritage Foundation.\u201d</p><p>The Norse Heritage Foundation wasn\u2019t so much about heritage as it was about Viking, in the most clich\u00e9 sense of the word. They drank huge quantities of beer, they brawled, and they wore horned helmets despite all historical evidence to the contrary.</p><p>\u201cUsed to be?\u201d Curran asked.</p><p>\u201cThey kicked him out for being drunk and violent.\u201d</p><p>Curran blinked. \u201cThe Norse Heritage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMhm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have to be drunk and violent just to get in?\u201d he asked. \u201cJust how disorderly did he get?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDagfinn is a creative soul,\u201d I said. \u201cHis real name is Don Williams. He packs a lot of magic and if he could have gotten out of his own way, he would be running the Norse Heritage by now. He\u2019s got a rap sheet as long as the Bible, all of it petty stupid stuff, and he\u2019s the only merc I know who actually works for free, because he\u2019s been fined so many times, it will take him years to get out of the Guild\u2019s debt. About two years ago, he got piss-drunk, took off all of his clothes, and broke through the gates of a Buddhist meditation center on the South Side. A group of bhikkhunis, female monks, was deep in meditation on the grounds. He chased them around, roaring something about them hiding hot Asian ladies. I guess he mistook them for men, because of the robes and shaved heads.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why didn\u2019t anybody point out the error of his ways to this fool?\u201d Doolittle asked.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps because they are Buddhists,\u201d Curran said. \u201cViolence is generally frowned upon in their community. How did it end?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDagfinn pulled a robe off one of the nuns and an elderly monk came up to him and hit him in the chest with the heel of his hand. Dagfinn did some flying and went through the monastery wall. Bricks fell on his face and gave him a quickie plastic surgery. Since the old monk had raised his hand in anger, he went into a self-imposed seclusion. He still lives near Stone Mountain in the woods. He was greatly revered and the monks got pissed off and went to see the Norse Heritage Foundation. Words were exchanged and the next morning the Foundation gave Dagfinn the boot. The neo-Vikings will know where he is. They kicked him out, but he\u2019s still their boy.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Curran nodded. \u201cOkay, we\u2019ll take the Jeep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t permit any technology past the fourteenth century AD in their territory. You\u2019ll have to ride a horse.\u201d</p><p>Curran\u2019s face snapped into a flat Beast Lord expression. \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou can jog if you want, but I\u2019m getting a horse.\u201d</p><p>A low rumble began in Curran\u2019s throat. \u201cI said we\u2019ll take the Jeep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I said they will put an axe into your carburetor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you even know what a carburetor is?\u201d Curran asked.</p><p>I knew it was a car part. \u201cThat\u2019s irrelevant.\u201d</p> <p>Doolittle cleared his throat. \u201cMy lord, my lady.\u201d</p><p>We looked at him.</p><p>\u201cTake it outside my hospital before you break anything.\u201d It didn\u2019t sound like a request.</p><p>A careful knock echoed through the door. A young woman stuck her head in. \u201cConsort?\u201d</p><p>What now? \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is a vampire downstairs waiting to see you.\u201d</p> <p>CHAPTER 4</p><p>The vampire sat on his haunches in the waiting room, an emaciated monstrosity. Vampires were nocturnal predators. Daylight burned their skin like fire, but the People had recently gotten around this restriction by applying their own patented brand of sunblock to their undead. It dried thick and came in assorted colors. This particular vampire sported a coat of bright lime-green. The sunblock covered the undead completely, every wrinkle, every crevice, every inch. The effect was vomit-inducing.</p><p>The vampire turned its head as I walked in, its eyes focusing on me with the intelligence of its navigator, sitting in an armored room miles away. The nightmarish jaws opened.</p><p>\u201cKate,\u201d Ghastek\u2019s dry voice said. \u201cCurran. Good morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Curran asked.</p><p>The vampire folded itself, perching in the chair like some mummified cat. \u201cI have a direct interest in determining the nature of that necklace. We have suffered great losses, we must account for them. Have you found a way to remove it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cSo the boy\u2019s life is still in jeopardy,\u201d Ghastek said.</p> <p>Thank you, Captain Obvious.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s being handled,\u201d Curran said.</p><p>\u201cI would like to be involved in that handling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you would,\u201d Curran said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe, but I go whole days without worrying about your likes and dislikes.\u201d</p><p>The vampire opened its mouth, imitating a sigh. It was an eerie sight: his jaws unhinged, his chest moved up and down, but no air came out.</p><p>\u201cI believe in civil discourse, so please forgive me if I sound blunt: you took a child away from his parents against their will. In other words, you abducted him by force. Last time I checked, that constitutes kidnapping. I have a very capable staff, which, should I give the word, would present a very compelling case to the Paranormal Activity Division.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe PAD can bite me,\u201d Curran said. \u201cI also have a very capable staff. I\u2019ll drown you in paper. How would you like to be sued?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn what grounds?\u201d The vamp looked outraged.</p><p>\u201cReckless endangerment.\u201d Curran leaned forward. \u201cYour journeymen dropped two vampires in the middle of a crowded restaurant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere were extenuating circumstances and you were unharmed.\u201d</p><p>Curran\u2019s eyes acquired a dangerous glint. \u201cI\u2019m sure the public will take that into account, especially after my people plaster the sordid horror story of the Arirang Massacre over every newspaper they can find.\u201d</p><p>The vamp bared its fangs.</p><p>Curran\u2019s upper lip trembled in the beginning of a snarl.</p><p>I stabbed a throwing knife into the table between them.</p><p>The man and the monster fell silent.</p><p>\u201cThere is a child being slowly choked to death upstairs,\u201d I said. \u201cIf the two of you could stop baring your teeth for a second, you might even remember that.\u201d</p><p>Silence stretched out between us.</p><p>\u201cI simply wish to help,\u201d Ghastek said.</p><p>Yeah, right.</p><p>Curran\u2019s face looked set in stone. \u201cWe don\u2019t need you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you do,\u201d Ghastek said. \u201cYou have the necklace, but I have Lawrence. He dated Amanda for over a year. I think you will be interested to know that Colin Sunny, Amanda\u2019s father, has a sister. She is married to Orencio Forney.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOrencio Forney, the DA?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrecisely,\u201d Ghastek said. \u201cAfter yesterday\u2019s affair, the Sunnys are staying in Forney\u2019s house. I trust you understand the implications.\u201d</p><p>I understood them, alright. The Sunnys had just become untouchable. If the Pack attempted to pick a fight with the DA, the tide of negative publicity would drown us, not to mention that every cop in the city would make it his personal mission to complicate shapeshifters\u2019 lives whenever possible.</p><p>Curran\u2019s face hardened into that blank, unreadable expression. He saw the writing on the wall as well, and he didn\u2019t like it. \u201cHave you asked for an interview?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the politest terms possible. We were extremely persuasive, but they are unavailable for comment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey aren\u2019t asking for Roderick?\u201d What the hell?</p><p>\u201cNo, they are not,\u201d Ghastek said. \u201cI found it extremely odd as well. The DA has circled the wagons. If you want any background on the boy and his mother, our Lawrence is your best bet. Give me access and I will share.\u201d</p><p>I looked at Curran. We needed that background.</p><p>His face was unreadable.</p><p>Come on, baby.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d he said.</p><p>A wise man once told me that a man\u2019s house said a lot about his soul. Over the years I had come to the conclusion that was complete bullshit. The Keep, with its foreboding, grim towers and massive fortifications, might have indicated something about Curran\u2019s need to protect his people, but it said nothing about how much responsibility he dragged around. It said nothing about the fact that he was fair and generous. And it sure as hell gave no hint that underneath all that Beast Lord\u2019s roaring, he was hilarious.</p><p>The Casino, on the other hand, looked like a beautiful mirage born of desert heat, sand, and magic. White and elegant, it nearly floated above the ground of the large lot decorated with fountains, statues, and colored lamps. All that beauty hid a stable of vampires. Undead, forever hungry, and gripped in the steel vise of navigators\u2019 minds, haunted its slim minarets. A casino milking money from human greed occupied its main floor, and deep inside it, the People brewed their schemes and machinations with the ruthless precision of a high-tech corporation, interested only in results and profits.</p><p>I parked the Jeep and peered at the Casino through the windshield. I didn\u2019t want to go in. Judging by the surly look on his face, Curran didn\u2019t want to go in either.</p><p>We opened our doors at the same time and headed toward the Casino.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re doing this for the child,\u201d Curran said.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d It was good to remember that. \u201cWe\u2019re just going to go in and talk to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd not kill anybody,\u201d Curran added.</p><p>\u201cOr anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd not break things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause we don\u2019t want a giant bill from the People.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Curran\u2019s face was grim. \u201cI\u2019m not giving them any of the Pack\u2019s money.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cWe\u2019ll be good, we won\u2019t have to pay any damages, and then we\u2019ll come out and take a nice shower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWash the stench off. I can smell the bloodsuckers from here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can feel them from here.\u201d</p><p>I could\u2014the sparks of vampiric magic tugged on me from the white parapets.</p><p>\u201cThanks for doing this,\u201d Curran said.</p><p>\u201cThank you for coming with me.\u201d</p><p>Get in, get out, don\u2019t cause a giant war between the Pack and the People. Piece of cake.</p><p>We passed through the tall arched entrance guarded by two men with curved yataghan swords. The guards wore black and looked suitably menacing. They very carefully didn\u2019t look at us.</p><p>Inside, a deluge of sound assaulted us: the noises of slot machines, refitted to work during magic, metal ringing, music, beeping, mixing with shouts from the crowd surrendering their hard-earned money for the promise of easy cash. Lemon-scented perfume drifted through the cold air\u2014the People were keeping their customers awake, because the sleeping couldn\u2019t gamble.</p><p>Curran wrinkled his nose.</p><p>\u201cAlmost there, baby,\u201d I told him, zeroing in on the service entrance door at the far end of the vast room.</p><p>A large overweight man spun away from the machines and ran into Curran. \u201cHey! Watch it!\u201d</p><p>Curran sidestepped him and we kept walking.</p><p>\u201cAsshole!\u201d the man barked at our backs.</p><p>\u201cI love this place,\u201d Curran said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so serene and peaceful, and filled with considerate people. I thought you\u2019d enjoy the ambiance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI adore it.\u201d</p><p>We passed through the service entrance. One of the journeymen, a man in black trousers, a black shirt, and a dark purple vest rose from behind the desk.</p><p>\u201cHow can I help you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright, Stuart.\u201d A woman descended the stairway on the side, walking into the room. She was five two and looked like an anatomical impossibility created from adolescent boys\u2019 dreams. Tiny waist, generous hips, and an award-winning chest, wrapped in dusky silk. Her hair fell down past her butt in red wavy locks, and when she smiled at you, you had a strong urge to do whatever she asked. Her name was Rowena and she ran the People\u2019s PR department and piloted the undead for a living.</p><p>She was also in debt to the witches, which in a roundabout way caused her to be in debt to me. If I asked a favor, she had to grant it, a fact we both carefully hid from everyone.</p><p>\u201cMr. Lennart. Ms. Daniels.\u201d Rowena fired off a beautiful smile. \u201cLawrence is waiting for you upstairs. Follow me, please.\u201d</p><p>We followed, Rowena\u2019s shiny perfect butt shifting as she walked up the stairs two feet in front of us. Curran heroically didn\u2019t look at it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She led us to a small room with a two-way mirror. One would\u2019ve expected a table, severe gray walls, and chairs bolted to the floor in an interrogation room, but no, the walls were cream with a delicate pale lattice carved at the top and the furniture consisted of a modern sofa and two soft chairs companionably arranged around a coffee table. Lawrence sat on the edge of the sofa. He looked pale and his eyes were bloodshot.</p><p>We sat in the chairs across from him.</p><p>\u201cDo you know who we are?\u201d Curran said quietly.</p> <p>Lawrence nodded. \u201cI\u2019ve been briefed. I\u2019m supposed to cooperate.\u201d</p><p>I pulled out a notepad from my pocket. \u201cHow long did you know Amanda?\u201d</p><p>Lawrence swallowed. \u201cThree years. She was admitted as an apprentice right after her high school graduation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long had you dated?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cThirteen months next week,\u201d he said. His voice was hoarse. He cleared his throat.</p> <p>\u201cTell us about her family,\u201d Curran said.</p><p>Lawrence sighed. \u201cShe didn\u2019t like them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d I prompted.</p><p>\u201cShe said her mother was very cold. Aurellia would go through the motions, make sure that Amanda and her brother were fed and appropriately dressed. She was very specific about their schedule. The Steel Calendar, Amanda called it. If they had a doctor\u2019s appointment or a school trip, it was put on the calendar and there was no deviation allowed from it. Amanda had perfect attendance her entire four years in high school. No matter how sick she was, her mother would send her to school. Never late. But there was no love or real warmth there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd her father?\u201d Curran asked.</p><p>\u201cColin worships the ground Aurellia walks on.\u201d Lawrence gave a bitter laugh. \u201cIt\u2019s like he is blind when she\u2019s in the room. The only time Amanda could talk to him was when her mother was otherwise occupied. She couldn\u2019t wait to get out of that house. She told me that\u2019s why she enlisted with the People. The apprentices qualify for room and board in the Casino.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWas her mother upset because Amanda did this?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cAurellia doesn\u2019t get upset. She\u2019s like a pretty robot,\u201d Lawrence said. \u201cNever screams. Never loses her temper. I don\u2019t think she cared one way or another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you ever interacted with the parents personally?\u201d Curran asked.</p><p>\u201cYes. We went to a dinner once. Colin seemed normal. Aurellia didn\u2019t speak, except when she ordered her food. I got a feeling she does only what is required of her, and talking to me or Amanda wasn\u2019t required.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the necklace?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Lawrence took several shallow rapid breaths.</p><p>We waited.</p><p>\u201cIt was a gift,\u201d he finally said. \u201cIt arrived at the house one Christmas, addressed to Colin. He took it out of the box\u2014it was in a glass case\u2014and tried to open it, and then Aurellia took it out of his hands. They put the necklace, still in its glass box, and displayed it on the wall in their foyer really high up. Amanda was about fifteen at the time. She loved it. She said she used to stand there and look at it all the time, because it was so beautiful. She was never allowed to touch it. They had a break-in six months ago. The burglars took some jewelry, money, and somehow got the necklace down and made off with it. She was really upset about it.\u201d</p> <p>Lawrence looked at his hands. \u201cI saw it at a pawnshop a week ago. I bought it for her. I...I killed her. She was so nice, so beautiful. She would sing little songs sometimes to herself when she was thinking about something or when she made coffee. And I killed her. She put it on and she just...she just died. I was right there and I couldn\u2019t do anything...\u201d</p><p>We stayed with him for another ten minutes, but Lawrence was done.</p><p>Ghastek waited for us in the hallway.</p><p>\u201cPlease tell me he\u2019s on suicide watch,\u201d Curran said.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d the Master of the Dead said. \u201cHe is under the care of a therapist, he\u2019s given access to the priest, and he is watched even when he sleeps. However, if he truly wants to kill himself, there is nothing any of us can do. It is unfortunate. He is nearing the end of his five-year journeymanship. We\u2019ve invested a lot of money and time into his education.\u201d</p><p>Of course. How silly of me to forget: the People didn\u2019t have employees, they had human assets, each of which came with a price tag attached.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve examined your drawing of the writing on the necklace,\u201d Ghastek said. \u201cYou said it appears to be a runic script of some sort but the characters are unfamiliar to me. How accurate is this drawing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs accurate as humanly possible,\u201d I told him.</p><p>He raised his eyebrows. \u201cAre you familiar with the term \u2018human error\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Are you familiar with the term \u201cknuckle sandwich\u201d? \u201cThe person who copied the runes from the necklace is an expert at what she does. Just because you don\u2019t recognize the script doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not runic in origin. The Elder Futhark alphabet has undergone many modifications over the years.\u201d</p><p>Ghastek took out the copy of Julie\u2019s drawing. \u201cI\u2019ve studied this subject extensively and I\u2019ve never seen a rune like this.\u201d Ghastek pointed to a symbol that looked like an X with a double left diagonal arm.</p><p>Well, of course. He didn\u2019t know it, therefore it couldn\u2019t possibly be a rune. \u201cBoth Fehu and Ansuz runes have double arms. Why couldn\u2019t this rune have one? If you tossed it into a collection of runes and told a layman to pick out one that doesn\u2019t belong, he wouldn\u2019t grab that one.\u201d</p><p>Ghastek gave me a condescending look. \u201cThe term \u2018layman\u2019 refers to a nonexpert by definition. Of course a nonexpert wouldn\u2019t be able to single out this rune, Kate. We could throw stars and spirals into the mix and he would be unlikely to pick those out either.\u201d</p><p>You conceited ass.</p><p>Curran cleared his throat.</p><p>I realized I had taken a step toward Ghastek. No killing, no punching, no destruction of property. Right.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re taking this matter to an expert,\u201d Curran said.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s prudent, considering the circumstances.\u201d</p><p>Oh, well, so good of him to give us his permission.</p><p>\u201cWhere is this expert?\u201d Ghastek asked.</p><p>\u201cAt the Norse Heritage Foundation,\u201d I told him.</p><p>Ghastek wrinkled his face into a semblance of a disgusted sneer, as if he\u2019d just stuck his head into a bag of rotten potatoes.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to see the neo-Vikings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re ignorant, loud buffoons. All they do is sit in their mead hall, get drunk, and punch each other when their masculinity is threatened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to come,\u201d I told him.</p><p>Ghastek let out a long-suffering sigh. \u201cVery well. I\u2019ll get my vampire.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 5</p><p>I was riding a horse called The Dude. The Dude, who also answered to Fred if he was feeling charitable, was what the Pack stables had called a \u201cTennessee Walker Blue Roan.\u201d The blue roan part was somewhat true\u2014the horse under me was dark gray, with the colors nearing black toward the head and the ankles. The Tennessee Walker part...Well, some Tennessee Walker was probably in there, but most of it was definitely a coldblood horse. A massive coldblood horse, close to twenty-five-hundred pounds. I was betting on a Percheron. Sitting atop The Dude was like riding a small elephant.</p><p>The presence of a vampire presented Curran with a dilemma. He refused to ride a horse, but he refused to let me travel in the company of an undead without backup either, so a compromise had to be reached. We stopped by the Cutting Edge office to get Andrea. Unfortunately, she was out. Apparently some shapeshifters had been murdered and Jim had pulled her in to head that investigation, a fact that he, of course, had neglected to mention. We kidnapped Derek and Ascanio instead.</p><p>Derek was our third employee. Once my sidekick, then Jim\u2019s spy, then a chief of Curran\u2019s personal guard, he was now working for Cutting Edge to acquire experience and figure out what it was he wanted to do. When I\u2019d first met him, he\u2019d been barely eighteen and pretty. Now he was close to twenty. Some bastards had poured molten silver on his face. The bastards were now dead, but he\u2019d never healed quite right.</p><p>Ascanio was our intern. He was fifteen, as beautiful as an angel, and a bouda or werehyena. Bouda children rarely survived adolescence, as many of them lost the fight for their sanity and went loup\u2014so Ascanio was treasured, babied, and spoiled beyond all reason. Unfortunately, he\u2019d gotten in trouble one too many times and was turned over to me to train, because it was decided I was least likely to kill him.</p><p>Derek and Ascanio rode their horses behind me, bickering quietly about something. Ahead of me, the lime-green nightmare that was Ghastek\u2019s vampire trotted along the road in a jerky, looping gait. Most vampires eventually lost their ability to run upright, reverting to quadruped locomotion as the Immortuus pathogen reshaped its victim\u2019s body into a new nightmare predator. I had come across very old vamps before. They didn\u2019t even resemble their former human shapes. But the vamp Ghastek piloted was only a few months old. It loped forward, switching between scuttling along the ground one moment, and shambling two-thirds upright the next like some grotesque puppet on the strings of a drunken puppeteer.</p><p>Next to the vampire cantered a freakishly large black poodle. His name was Grendel, he was my dog, and while he wasn\u2019t the sharpest tool in the shed, he loved me and he was handy in a fight.</p><p>A few dozen yards behind us, an enormous lion trotted. When shapeshifters transformed, their animal forms were always larger than their natural counterparts, and Curran the Lion wasn\u2019t just large. He looked prehistoric. Colossal, gray, with faint darker stripes staining his fur like whip marks, he moved along the road at an easy pace, seemingly tireless. Which was why I\u2019d ended up with The Dude. I had walked into the stables and told them I\u2019d be traveling between a vampire and a lion the size of a rhino and I needed a horse that wouldn\u2019t freak out. True to the stable master\u2019s recommendation, The Dude seemed unflappable. Occasionally, when Curran flanked us, he would flare his nostrils a bit while the other two horses shied and made panicked noises, but mostly The Dude just pounded his way forward in a straight line, convinced that the lion was a figment of his imagination and that the vampire ahead of him was just Grendel\u2019s deformed mutant brother. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>We were our own three-ring circus. Sadly, we had no audience: to the left of us the forest rose in a jagged line, and to the right a low hill climbed up, rocks and grass, before running into another line of trees at the apex.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never met the neo-Vikings,\u201d Ascanio said.</p><p>\u201cA good portion of them are mercs,\u201d I said over my shoulder. \u201cThey\u2019re a rowdy lot and not really what you would call true to tradition. Some are, but most are there because they saw a movie or two in childhood and think \u2018Viking\u2019 is a noun.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not?\u201d Derek asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. Originally it was a verb as in \u2018to go viking.\u2019 The Norse Heritage guys wear horned helmets, drink beer out of a giant vat, and start fights. As neo-Viking communities go, they are better off financially than most, so they can afford to have some fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere do they get their money?\u201d Derek asked.</p><p>I nodded at the curving road. \u201cAround that bend.\u201d</p><p>A couple of minutes later we cleared the curve. A vast lake spread on our left. Blue-green water stretched into the distance, tinted with bluish haze. Here and there green islands ringed with sand thrust through the water. To the right, an enormous mead hall built with huge timbers rose from the crest of a low hill like the armored back of some sea serpent. As we stood there, two karves, the longboats, slid from behind the nearest island, their carved dragon heads rising high above the lake\u2019s surface.</p> <p>Ascanio raised his hand to shield his eyes.</p><p>\u201cLake Lanier,\u201d I told him. \u201cThe Norse Heritage Foundation built a river fleet of Dragon Ships here. They\u2019re not the only neo-Vikings in the region. There are several Norse groups along the Eastern seaboard and quite a few of them want to cruise up and down the coast in a proper boat. The Norse Heritage sells them boats and trains these wannabe raiders for shallow water sailing. They also give vacationers a ride for the right price. They\u2019re kind of touchy about it, so I wouldn\u2019t ask if they do children\u2019s parties.\u201d</p><p>Ascanio cracked a smile. \u201cOr what, they\u2019ll try to drown us in their beer vat? \u2018Try\u2019 being the operative word.\u201d</p><p>We started toward the mead hall. Midway up the hill, the vampire paused when a man walked out in the middle of the road from behind a birch. Six and a half feet tall, he stood wrapped in chain mail. A cape of black fur billowed from his shoulders. His war helm, a near perfect replication of the Gjermundbu helmet, shielded the top of his head and half his face. The stainless steel had been polished until the sun\u2019s rays slid off of it, as if he wore a mirror on his head. The man carried an enormous single axe on a long wooden handle. I\u2019d tried to pick up the axe once and it weighed ten pounds at least. He was slower than molasses in January with it, but it looked impressive.</p><p>Derek focused on the big man. \u201cWho is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Gunnar. He\u2019s the Norse Heritage\u2019s idea of a security detail.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat, all by himself?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cHe\u2019s sufficient.\u201d</p><p>Ghastek\u2019s vampire stared at the giant Viking, motionless like a statue, while the Master of the Dead mulled the situation over. The bloodsucker turned, scuttled toward us, and fell back in line behind my horse. Apparently, Ghastek had decided that his vamp was too precious to risk.</p><p>We drew closer.</p><p>Gunnar took a deep breath and roared, \u201cVestu heill!\u201d</p><p>Ow. My ears. \u201cHello, Gunnar.\u201d</p><p>He squinted at me through his face mask and dropped his voice down. \u201cHey, Kate.\u201d He sounded slightly out of breath.</p><p>\u201cGood to see you.\u201d</p> <p>He leaned on his axe, pulled the helmet off, and wiped sweat from his forehead, revealing reddish hair braided on his temples. \u201cYou heading up to see Ragnvald?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll of you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven the lion?\u201d</p><p>The lion opened his mouth, showing his big teeth. Yes, yes, you\u2019re bad. We know, Your Majesty.</p><p>\u201cEven the lion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about?\u201d Gunnar asked.</p><p>\u201cDagfinn. You\u2019ve seen him around?\u201d</p><p>Gunnar took a moment to spit into the dirt, making a big show of it. \u201cNope. And all the better for it.\u201d</p><p>Bullshit. \u201cToo bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Gunnar waved me on with the helmet. \u201cYou\u2019re good to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>We rode on.</p><p>\u201cHe lied,\u201d Ascanio said.</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d Gunnar knew exactly where Dagfinn was. He took his cues from Ragnvald, and since he wasn\u2019t talking, the jarl probably wouldn\u2019t be talking either. This would not go well.</p><p>We rode up through the wooden gates to the mead hall. The rest of the settlement sat lower down the hill, past the mead hall: solid wooden houses scattered here and there. People walked to and fro, men in woolen tunics and cloaks, women in ankle-length gowns and hangerocks\u2014woolen apron-dresses. They were an assorted crew: some were white, some were black, some were Hispanic. A couple to our right looked Chinese. Norse Heritage took everyone in. Viking wasn\u2019t a nationality\u2014it was a way of life. As long as you thought you were a Viking, you had a place at their table.</p><p>People gaped at Curran as we passed. The vampire and the rest of us got significantly less attention.</p><p>As we dismounted before the hitching rail, I saw a familiar black Shire stallion in the pasture, segregated by himself. The huge horse stood almost eighteen and a half hands tall, the white feathers at his huge feet shaking every time he moved. A pale scar snaked its way up the horse\u2019s left shoulder. Hello, Magnus. Where is your master?</p><p>The stallion stared in my direction and bared his teeth. Now horses were giving me crap.</p><p>\u201cMind your manners,\u201d I murmured.</p><p>\u201cBest behavior,\u201d Ascanio assured me.</p><p>Mentioning that I was talking to a horse who couldn\u2019t hear me would\u2019ve totally cramped my boss style, so I nodded and walked up to the mead hall.</p><p>A large, rawboned woman barred my path. A large gun hung on her right hip and a small axe hung on her left.</p><p>\u201cHrefna,\u201d I acknowledged her. We had run into each other in the Guild before. She was good with both knife and sword and rarely lost her temper.</p><p>\u201cKate.\u201d Her voice was quiet. \u201cThe lion has to stay outside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>The lion shook his mane.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t let him inside,\u201d Hrefna said. \u201cYou bring him in, someone\u2019s going to make trouble just to see if they can put his head on their wall. I\u2019ve got to do my job. It\u2019s your call.\u201d</p><p>I looked at Curran. The lion melted. Skin stretched, bones twisted, and human Curran straightened. He was completely nude. Gloriously nude.</p><p>Hrefna raised her eyebrows.</p><p>Curran pulled jeans and a shirt from my saddlebag.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Hrefna said. \u201cI always wondered why you went all shapeshifter. Explains things.\u201d</p><p>The vampire next to me rolled his blood-red eyes.</p><p>We walked inside the mead hall. The vampire, shapeshifters, the dog, and the lion man followed me.</p><p>A huge room greeted me. Twin rows of evenly spaced out tables ran parallel along the length of the chamber. Originally the Vikings had tried to have the tables joined in two lines, but they couldn\u2019t sweep under them, so they went to Plan B, which made their mead hall resemble a barbarian cafeteria. People mulled around the tables. Some ate, some talked, some oiled their weapons. The tables ran into a raised platform at the opposite end of the hall. On the platform a man sat in a large chair carved from driftwood and lined with furs. His shoulders stretched his blue woolen tunic. His face, framed by a glossy black mane of hair, was dark and carved with sharp precision. A narrow gold band rested on his head.</p><p>He glanced at us. Dark eyes took our measure. He noted Curran, frowned, and looked away pretending he hadn\u2019t seen us. Curran preferred to stay anonymous. Not many people besides the city heavyweights knew what he looked like. Ragnvald was trying to decide if the polite thing to do was to acknowledge Curran or pretend he wasn\u2019t there.</p><p>Before we left on this fun trip, we had discussed our strategy, and I volunteered to take point. If Curran came in his official capacity as the Beast Lord, there would be formal greetings and ceremony and the whole thing would take much longer than needed. Besides, I knew the neo-Vikings better than he did, so it made sense for me to take the lead. Curran decided to go as what he referred to as a \u201credshirt.\u201d Apparently it was the term for some sort of disposable attendant from some old TV show.</p><p>\u201cIs that the jarl?\u201d Ascanio whispered behind me.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he\u2019s Native American.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChoctaw,\u201d I told him. \u201cThe Vikings don\u2019t care how you look. They care how well you swing your axe.\u201d</p><p>I headed down between the tables with my little entourage at my back. This would have been so much easier if I had come by myself.</p><p>About ten feet from the platform Ragnvald decided he couldn\u2019t ignore us any longer. \u201cKate! Vestu heill! Long time no see.\u201d</p><p>Not long enough. \u201cHello, Ragnvald. These are my associates.\u201d There. I didn\u2019t mention Curran by name. That should clue him in.</p><p>Ragnvald pushed himself off the chair. Upright, he was over six feet tall. He took a step off the platform and nodded to me. \u201cI was just thinking of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s probably because you saw me walk through the door and then pretended I wasn\u2019t here for the last couple of minutes.\u201d</p><p>Ragnvald\u2019s face split into a grin. \u201cI just couldn\u2019t believe my eyes. The alpha of the shapeshifters popping in unannounced. I\u2019m shocked.\u201d</p><p>Oh, you sonovabitch. He was still trying to turn this into some sort of spectacle. \u201cI\u2019m not here in that capacity.\u201d</p><p>Ragnvald tapped his band. \u201cThis never comes off. Best to remember it now. But come on, we\u2019ll talk business.\u201d He raised his voice, shaking the nearby cups. \u201cSomeone bring drinks to our guests.\u201d</p><p>Why did everyone have to be so damn loud all the time?</p><p>Ragnvald nodded to a side table. \u201cPlease.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He took a seat and I sat across from him.

Ragnvald held his up. I smashed my tankard against his. Beer splashed. We raised the tankard and pretended to take much bigger gulps than we actually did.</p><p>Curran drank his beer. Apparently, my taking the lead meant he went mute.</p> <p>The young woman sashayed over to Ascanio and Derek and led them to a neighboring table. Judging by how hard her hips were working, she was open for business.</p><p>\u201cSo, what brings you to our mead hall?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking for Dagfinn.\u201d</p><p>Ragnvald grimaced. \u201cWhat has he done now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust got some weird runes I need him to translate for me.\u201d</p> <p>Ragnvald spread his arms. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen the man. You should talk to Helga about the runes.\u201d</p><p>I had made some calls this morning. \u201cWe did talk to Helga. Talked to Dorte and old man Rasmus, too. They can\u2019t help us. Dagfinn is our best lead for now.\u201d</p><p>A huge older man staggered into the hall. Thick through the shoulders and slabbed with what my adoptive father had called hard fat, he moved in that peculiar careful way drunks do when they have trouble putting one foot in front of the other and don\u2019t want to pitch over. His leather vest sat askew on his large frame, his face was ruddy from cold or too much booze, and his long graying hair hung down in two braids, tangling with a mess of a gray beard.</p><p>It\u2019s all fun and games until the drunk Viking Santa shows up.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to tell you.\u201d Ragnvald drank a tiny swallow of his beer. \u201cHe isn\u2019t here. We expelled him months ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d Curran said.</p> <p>\u201cIt is,\u201d Ragnvald insisted.</p><p>The soused Saint Nick zeroed in on the vampire sitting on the floor by the table where the shapeshifters were looking at their beer. The drunk blinked his bleary eyes and shambled toward the vamp.</p><p>\u201cI hear the Guild is having a meeting soon,\u201d Ragnvald said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019ve been told,\u201d I said.</p><p>The older Viking pointed at the vampire. \u201cWhat is this shit?\u201d</p><p>Nobody answered.</p><p>Santa upped his voice a notch. \u201cWhat is this shit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSettle down, Dad,\u201d a younger man said from the corner.</p> <p>Santa pivoted to the speaker. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me to settle down, you stupid son of a whore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t talk about Mom that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk about her...I\u2019ll...what is this shit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI also hear that the Pack has been called in to mediate.\u201d Ragnvald looked at me for a long moment so I\u2019d register that it was important.</p><p>\u201cAha.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have fifteen full-time members in the Guild,\u201d Ragnvald said.</p><p>I nodded. \u201cI know. You put in what, eight years?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeven and some change.\u201d</p><p>Santa rocked back, took a deep breath, and spat on the vamp.</p><p>Awesome. \u201cAre you going to do anything about that?\u201d</p><p>Ragnvald glanced over his shoulder. \u201cThat\u2019s Johan. He\u2019s just having a bit of fun. About the mediation, Kate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about it?\u201d</p><p>The vamp unhinged his maw. \u201cOnly a fool fights with drunks and idiots,\u201d Ghastek\u2019s voice said.</p><p>\u201cAre you calling me an idiot?\u201d Johan squinted at the vamp.</p><p>People at the other tables stopped eating and trickled over to watch closer. They smelled a fight coming and didn\u2019t want to miss the show. This wasn\u2019t going well.</p><p>The vampire shrugged, mimicking Ghastek\u2019s gesture. \u201cIf a certain drunk spits on my vampire again, he will regret it.\u201d</p><p>Johan leaned back, a puzzled expression on his face. Apparently, Ghastek had managed to stump him.</p><p>\u201cWhich way are you leaning?\u201d Ragnvald said.</p><p>Nice try. \u201cWhere is Dagfinn, Ragnvald?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve told you twice now, he isn\u2019t here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding me. His house is here, his mother still lives here, and his stallion is out in the pasture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe gave him to his mother,\u201d Ragnvald said.</p><p>\u201cHe gave Magnus to his mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat horse is a bloody beast. Nobody can ride him except Dagfinn. The only reason Magnus hasn\u2019t bitten Dagfinn\u2019s hand off by now is because every time he tries, Dagfinn bites him back. And you\u2019re telling me Dagfinn gave him to his mother? What is she going to do with him?\u201d</p><p>Ragnvald spread his arms. \u201cI don\u2019t know, use him for home protection or something. I\u2019m not a psychic. I don\u2019t know what goes through that man\u2019s head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean me?\u201d Johan roared. \u201cYou mean I\u2019ll regret it?\u201d</p><p>Oh no. He finally got it.</p><p>\u201cDo you see any other fat old drunks making a spectacle of themselves?\u201d Ascanio asked.</p><p>Johan swung over to Derek. \u201cYou! Slap a muzzle on your girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>Derek smiled. It was a slow, controlled baring of teeth. I fought a shudder. The couple of guys to the left of us grabbed their chairs.</p><p>\u201cDerek, we\u2019re guests,\u201d I called out.</p><p>Curran chuckled quietly to himself. Apparently he found me amusing.</p><p>\u201cThey need a lesson in hospitality,\u201d Ghastek said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll show you hospitality.\u201d Johan sucked in some air.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do it,\u201d Ghastek warned.</p><p>Johan hacked. The gob of spit landed on the vamp\u2019s forehead.</p><p>\u201cSuck on that!\u201d Johan pivoted to Derek. \u201cYou\u2019re next!\u201d</p><p>Ascanio shot from his seat in a blur and punched Johan off his feet. Vikings swarmed. Someone screamed. A chair flew above us and crashed into the wall. Grendel bounced in place, barking his head off.</p><p>Ragnvald heaved an exasperated sigh. \u201cWhich way are you leaning, Kate? Veterans or Mark?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to tell me where Dagfinn is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Bastard. \u201cThen I guess I don\u2019t know which way I\u2019m leaning.\u201d</p><p>Ragnvald looked at Curran. \u201cSeriously?\u201d</p><p>Curran shrugged his broad shoulders. \u201cIt\u2019s her show.\u201d</p><p>A tankard hurtled through the room and crashed against Ragnvald\u2019s back. He surged to his feet roaring. \u201cAlright, you fuckers, who threw that?\u201d</p><p>The second tankard took him straight in the forehead. He staggered and lunged into the full-out brawl raging in the middle of the mead hall. Fists flew, people growled, and above it all, Ghastek\u2019s vamp crawled up the wall to the ceiling, its left paw gripping pissed-off Johan by his ankle.</p><p>I sighed, jumped on the table, and kicked some Viking in the face.</p><p>My butt hurt, because a Viking woman had kicked me from behind while I was busy, and the motion of my horse wasn\u2019t doing me any favors. The red spot on my shoulder promised to bloom into a baseball-sized bruise, but other than that I\u2019d gotten away scot-free. Derek sported a cut across his chest and Ascanio, whose shirt had somehow gotten mysteriously ripped to shreds in the heat of the battle, was black-and-blue from the neck down. It wouldn\u2019t last more than a couple of hours and by the evening the lot of them would look like new, while I would still be nursing a sore shoulder. Shapeshifters.</p><p>The wind brought a whiff of hops from Ghastek\u2019s vamp loping next to me. The Vikings had tried to drown it in the barrel of beer and most of its green sunblock had come off, so Ghastek had ended up rolling him in some mud to keep the skin damage to a minimum. The mud had dried to a nasty crust and the vamp looked like something that would come out of Grendel\u2019s tail end.</p><p>Grendel had spent most of the fight barking and biting random people and was now smeared with someone\u2019s vomit.</p><p>Curran had escaped unscathed, mostly because when people tried to assault him, he punched them once and then they didn\u2019t get up. He walked now next to my horse in his human form, a big smile on his face.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked him.</p><p>\u201cGood thing you took the lead on that one,\u201d he said. \u201cIt could\u2019ve gone badly and degenerated into a huge brawl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScrew you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I hope you do, baby.\u201d</p><p>In your dreams.</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s why I don\u2019t like visiting the neo-Vikings,\u201d Ghastek said, his voice dry. \u201cThey\u2019re an uncivilized, idiotic lot and nothing good ever comes from it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey started it,\u201d Ascanio said.</p><p>\u201cOf course they started it,\u201d I growled. \u201cThey\u2019re Vikings. That\u2019s what they do.\u201d</p><p>Ghastek cleared his throat. \u201cI can\u2019t help but point out that now Dagfinn knows we\u2019re looking for him. He may go into hiding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDagfinn doesn\u2019t do hiding. If he isn\u2019t involved in this mess, he\u2019ll show up on my doorstep demanding to know what\u2019s going on. If he is involved, he\u2019ll show up on my doorstep, waving his axe and trying to crush skulls. Works either way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we wait?\u201d</p><p>It made me grit my teeth. I\u2019d hoped we\u2019d get a hold of Dagfinn today. Roderick was running out of time, but there wasn\u2019t anything else we could do. \u201cWe go home and wait.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 6</p><p>We parted ways with Ghastek and the four of us\u2014Curran, Derek, Ascanio, and I\u2014made our way back to the Keep. Jim waited for us on the stone steps as we rode into the courtyard.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe went to see the Vikings,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cThis is nothing,\u201d Curran said. \u201cYou should\u2019ve seen what happened to the vampire.\u201d</p><p>Jim smiled.</p><p>I dismounted and gave The Dude\u2019s reigns to a shapeshifter kid from the stables.</p><p>\u201cSome people are here to see you,\u201d Jim told me.</p><p>\u201cWhat people?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom the Guild.\u201d</p><p>Argh. \u201cFine. How\u2019s the boy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoolittle says he\u2019s the same. Your guests are in the second-floor conference room, third door on the left.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I marched to the second floor. Grendel decided to accompany me. Five people waited in the small reception hallway by the third conference room, guarded by a female shapeshifter. One of them was Mark, the late Solomon Red\u2019s self-appointed successor, and the other four were Bob Carver, Ivera Nielsen, Ken, and Juke, collectively known as the Four Horsemen. Most mercs were loners. Sometimes, when the job demanded it, they paired up the way Jim and I did, but groups of more than two were rare. The Four Horsemen were the exception to the rule. They made a cohesive, strong team. They took rough jobs and finished them efficiently and mostly aboveboard, and they were respected by the rest of the mercs.</p><p>The two parties stopped glowering at each other long enough to contemplate my dog.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is that?\u201d Bob asked.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s my attack poodle. Did you agree to come here at the same time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell no,\u201d Juke said, shaking her head with spiked black hair. \u201cWe were here first. He just showed up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI made an appointment,\u201d Mark said. \u201cOnce again, you\u2019re bringing your bully tactics to the table.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an asshole,\u201d Ken told him.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re a thug.\u201d</p> <p>Why me?</p><p>This was the first time I\u2019d heard about an appointment. I made a mental note to ask Jim about that and pulled a quarter from my pocket. \u201cHeads.\u201d I pointed to the Four Horsemen. \u201cMark, you\u2019re tails.\u201d</p><p>I flipped the coin into the air and slapped it onto the back of my wrist.</p><p>\u201cTails.\u201d I nodded at Mark. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>We stepped into the conference room, I shut the door, and we sat at a large table of knotted wood.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d</p> <p>Mark leaned forward. He wore a crisp business suit and a conservative burgundy tie. His dark brown hair was cut in that executive/politician style: not too long, not too short, conservative, neat. His nails were clean and manicured, his chin showed no stubble, and he smelled of masculine cologne. Not overpowering, but definitely detectable.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to talk to you about the Guild arbitration,\u201d he said.</p><p>And here I thought he\u2019d made the trip to chat about the weather. \u201cI\u2019m listening.\u201d</p><p>Mark looked at the dog. Grendel gave him an evil eye.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll cut to the chase: I\u2019d like to take over the Guild.\u201d</p><p>Ambitious, aren\u2019t we? \u201cI kind of gathered that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not popular. I don\u2019t wear leather and I don\u2019t carry guns.\u201d He braided the fingers of his hands into a single fist and rested it on the table. \u201cBut I make the Guild run. I make sure the customers are happy, the profits are made, and everyone gets paid on time. Without me the whole thing would collapse.\u201d</p><p>I had no doubt it would. \u201cI\u2019m waiting for my part in this.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYour vote will be the tiebreaker,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d like us to come to some sort of arrangement.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d just dug a lovely hole for himself. I waited to see if he would jump into it.</p><p>\u201cOf course, I understand that sufficient compensation is in order and our arrangement would have to be equitable and mutually beneficial.\u201d</p><p>And he had. I sighed. \u201cMark, the problem isn\u2019t that you can\u2019t run the Guild. The problem is that you think \u2018white collar\u2019 is a noble title.\u201d</p><p>He blinked, obviously taken aback.</p><p>\u201cIn your world, everyone has a price,\u201d I said. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what mine is, but you think you can afford it. It doesn\u2019t work like that. You could\u2019ve gone many ways with this. You could\u2019ve argued that with the leadership of the Guild in limbo, nobody is getting paid. You could\u2019ve pointed out that the longer this goes on, the more talent the Guild will lose, as experienced mercs move on to new jobs to feed their families. Offering to bribe me was the worst argument you could\u2019ve made. My opinion isn\u2019t for sale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI meant no offense,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cBut you did offend, and you\u2019ve demonstrated that you have no idea how to relate to me. A lot of guys are like me, Mark. Yes, you make the Guild run, but you lack the elemental understanding of what makes mercs tick, probably because you never were one. If I wanted to endorse you, which I don\u2019t, I\u2019d have to defend my position before the Guild, which I find difficult under the circumstances.\u201d</p><p>He chewed on that for a long minute. \u201cFair enough. So you\u2019ll vote for the Horsemen then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for seeing me.\u201d Mark got up and left.</p><p>The door had barely had a chance to swing open before Bob shouldered his way in and dropped into one of the chairs around the table. Ivera followed, uneasy, watching me.</p><p>Bob was the leader of the Horsemen. If our world had spawned any veteran gladiators, he would be one of them. He was on the other side of forty and built with that mature strength and endurance that would make him a tough opponent even for people half his age. He might not be as fast as he used to be, but he had plenty of experience and he used it. Ivera was a tall, large Hispanic woman. She was nasty in a fight and a firebug\u2014fire mage\u2014on top of it.</p><p>The other two members of the Horsemen remained outside. Ken, a Hungarian mage, measured out words like they were gold and Juke, well, Juke was barely twenty and made up for her lack of experience in natural viciousness and a hot temper. She was fast and she liked to talk trash. I understood the urge. I liked to talk trash too, but twenty-year-old me would\u2019ve chewed Juke up and spat her out.</p><p>I looked at the two veterans. \u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d</p><p>Bob leaned forward. The chair creaked and I almost winced. He was a big guy and the chair was none too sturdy.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come right to the point,\u201d he said. \u201cSolomon was one of us. A merc. A working stiff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, Solomon only worked as a merc for the first three years after forming the Guild, and given that he\u2019s been underground for a few months, we can drop \u2018working\u2019 from his description.\u201d</p><p>Bob plowed ahead. \u201cAll the same, he knew what it\u2019s like to be out in the field. He knew how to take care of the guys. The man had a heart, unlike that prick. He\u2019ll bleed us dry if we let him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy \u2018that prick\u2019 you mean Mark?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho else?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cJust checking.\u201d</p><p>Bob knocked on my desk with his scarred knuckles, making a point. \u201cThat pencil neck wants to run the Guild. Between the four of us, we\u2019ll do better. Someone\u2019s got to look out for the guys.\u201d</p><p>I spread my arms. \u201cMore power to you. What do you want from me?\u201d</p><p>Bob scooted forward. The chair groaned. \u201cSolomon, you, and Mark are the only people with any sort of official designation other than Guild member, except for the clerk and the payroll ladies. You were the first of us to make it into the Order and you did good work as a liaison. People remember that. And now you\u2019re the Beast Lord\u2019s...\u201d He groped for a word.</p><p>\u201cMate,\u201d Ivera told him.</p><p>\u201cYes, that. You have street cred. The mercs will never follow Mark. You know it, I know it, Ivera knows it.\u201d</p><p>I glanced at Ivera. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat he said,\u201d she said grimly.</p><p>I leaned back. They wouldn\u2019t like it, but it had to be said. \u201cThree mercs go on a gig. One bails midway through the fight, the second dies, the third loses a hand. Are they eligible for Guild disability pay?\u201d</p><p>Bob thought about it. \u201cThe guy that ran off gets nothing, that\u2019s abandonment in progress. The dead guy\u2019s next of kin gets thirty percent. The guy without a hand gets disability.\u201d</p><p>I sighed. \u201cThe first question to ask is how long any of them have been in the Guild. You have to hit the five-year mark to qualify for disability and do seven years to qualify for the death benefit. Until then, you die, your family gets a flat ten grand from your standard life insurance. The next question is, when did the first guy take off? If he did it once the fight started and the danger was evident, the Guild is entitled to garnish his wages, because his abandonment in progress becomes abandonment in imminent danger. How much do we garnish, Bob?\u201d</p><p>Muscles played on his jaw. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we move on to disability. How much do we pay? What\u2019s a hand worth? Does it matter if he was right- or left-handed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Bob said again. His eyes told me he didn\u2019t like where I was headed.</p><p>\u201cNeither do I. But you know who does? Mark. I can call Mark right now and he\u2019ll rattle it off the top of his head. Let\u2019s talk contracts. Who provides the ammo for the Guild supply room? How much of a discount do we get from them? The Guild has a deal with Avalon Construction to clear the magic hazmat at their prospective construction sites. It\u2019s a sweet contract, so you know there were perks. Bribes. Gifts. How much and to whom?\u201d</p><p>Bob growled a bit. \u201cAll this stuff can be learned.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cSure. But how long will it take you? The Guild has been without a leader for what, six months now, and you still haven\u2019t learned any of it. Would it even matter by the time you finished learning?\u201d</p><p>Bob crossed his arms. \u201cYou could do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I can\u2019t. First, it\u2019s not my job. I\u2019ve got my hands full with the shapeshifters and my own business. Second, what little I know I\u2019ve learned only because it came up during my tenure as a liaison. It would take me ages to find it in the Guild\u2019s Manual. For better or worse, Solomon made Mark the sole brain behind this operation and Mark has years of experience. You don\u2019t have the knack for wheeling and dealing, Bob. You\u2019re a good solid tactician. You know what the gig needs and you\u2019re good at picking the right people and getting it done. The mercs look up to you. But bargaining isn\u2019t your thing.\u201d</p><p>Bob\u2019s eyebrows crept closer together. \u201cYou\u2019ll be backing Mark then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will tell you what I told him.

Either I made this meeting, or the Guild would suspend me.</p><p>\u201cNot that it would matter,\u201d Bob said. \u201cBut we did all manage to agree that you need to pick somebody by Monday.\u201d</p><p>Ivera got up and put her hand on Bob\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWe should go.\u201d</p> <p>He started to say something and changed his mind. I watched him get to his feet. He nodded to me. \u201cLater.\u201d</p><p>I dragged myself upstairs to the infirmary. Roderick was playing checkers with a shapeshifter boy. The collar on his neck had gone from orange to canary yellow.</p><p>I climbed the million stairs to our quarters, asked the guards to order some food from the kitchen, and took a shower. When I came out, Curran was sprawled on our giant couch, his eyes closed.</p><p>I flopped next to him. \u201cHelp.\u201d</p><p>The blond eyebrows rose a quarter inch. \u201cMhm?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe mercs aren\u2019t going to reach a consensus.\u201d I lay next to him on my side, propping my head up with my hand. \u201cNo matter who I pick tomorrow, they won\u2019t like it. Mark can run the Guild, but the mercs despise him. The mercs can do the jobs, but the admin stuff leaves them clueless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake them work together,\u201d Curran said.</p><p>\u201cNot going to happen. They hate each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf fourteen alphas can meet in the same room every week without killing each other, so can Mark and the mercs. The Guild has been without leadership for months. The people are tired and they want a strong leader. Not a tyrant, but a leader who inspires confidence. You need to walk in there and roar until they cringe. Demonstrate that you are strong enough to take away their freedom to choose, make sure it sinks in, and then give some of the choice back to them on your terms.\u201d</p><p>Hmm.</p><p>\u201cTie it back to Solomon Red, too,\u201d Curran said. \u201cIt\u2019s basic psychology: under Solomon things ran, when he died, they broke. The more time passes, the more rosy the times of Solomon look to the average merc. So if you attack them from the \u2018Let\u2019s go back to the good old days\u2019 angle, they will fold. Make them think that following you is what they want to do.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou scare me sometimes,\u201d I told him.</p><p>He yawned. \u201cI\u2019m totally harmless.\u201d</p><p>Someone knocked on the door. A bit soon for the food.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d Curran called.</p><p>Mercedes, one of the guards, entered. \u201cThere is a man outside, my lord. He is big, he\u2019s wearing a cape, and he\u2019s got a giant axe. We\u2019re also pretty sure he\u2019s drunk.\u201d</p><p>Dagfinn.</p><p>\u201cWhat does he want?\u201d Curran asked.</p><p>\u201cHe says he wants to fight the Beast Lord.\u201d</p> <p>CHAPTER 7</p><p>Curran and I stood in the arched entrance to the Keep\u2019s courtyard. Dagfinn waited in the clearing outside. He was six feet eight inches tall, and he weighed a shade above three hundred pounds. None of it was fat. Dagfinn looked hard. His broad shoulders strained his tunic, his biceps had trouble fitting into the sleeves, and his legs in worn-out jeans carried enough muscle to make you wince at the thought of him kicking you. His curly hair fell over his shoulders in a dense reddish wave. He\u2019d trimmed his beard, but his red eyebrows overshadowed his eyes.</p><p>He stood brandishing a battle axe etched with runes that matched the tattoos on his arms. The blade of the axe flared at the toe and heel, its razor-sharp edge spanning a full twelve inches. Combined with the four-foot haft for extra power, the axe sheared flesh and bone like an oversized meat cleaver.</p><p>\u201cLook, I fought this guy before. Maybe you should talk him away from the cliff. He\u2019s drunk and isn\u2019t in his right mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe challenged me,\u201d Curran said. \u201cThere will be no talking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuit yourself,\u201d I told him. Mr. Make Fun of My Leadership wanted to have it his way. Well, he\u2019d get it.</p><p>Around us the shapeshifters were piling out onto the battlements. Every balcony and parapet facing in Dagfinn\u2019s direction was occupied. Great. An audience was just what we needed.</p><p>\u201cAnything I should know?\u201d Curran asked me.</p><p>\u201cThe axe is magic. Don\u2019t touch it. Dagfinn is pretty magic, too. If you kill him, I\u2019ll be really mad at you. We need him to read the damn runes.\u201d</p><p>Curran stretched his shoulders and walked out into the clearing.</p><p>\u201cI heard you were looking for me,\u201d Dagfinn growled. His voice matched him, deep and torn about the edges.</p><p>\u201cShe has some runes she wants you to look at.\u201d</p><p>Dagfinn leaned to the side to look at me. \u201cKate? What the hell are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI live here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m with him now.\u201d</p><p>Dagfinn looked at Curran. \u201cYou and her are...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s my mate,\u201d Curran said.</p><p>Dagfinn swung his axe onto his shoulder. The runes sparked with pale green. \u201cWell, how about that? You know what, I don\u2019t care, I\u2019ll still beat your ass, but I like her so I won\u2019t kill you.\u201d</p><p>Curran\u2019s eyes turned gold. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Dagfinn waved his arm at him. \u201cWell, go on. Do your transforming thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, there is a need,\u201d Dagfinn assured him.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to talk all day? I\u2019m a busy man,\u201d Curran told him.</p><p>\u201cFine. Let\u2019s get to it.\u201d Frost condensed on Dagfinn\u2019s hair. His skin turned dark. He grew, gaining half a foot of height, his shoulders spreading wider.</p><p>\u201cHave fun, baby,\u201d I called.</p><p>Pale tendrils of cold spilled from Dagfinn\u2019s body. The icy mist danced along his skin, clutched at the runes tattooed on his arms, and drained down in a brilliant cascade onto his axe. The weapon burst with bright green.</p><p>I braced myself against the stone wall. Dagfinn swung his axe.</p><p>Curran jumped aside. A flash exploded to the left of him, blinding white and searing. Thunder slapped my ears. An air fist slammed into me. Curran flew a bit and rolled up to his feet.</p><p>A three-foot hole smoked in the grass where Curran had stood. Dagfinn roared like an enraged tornado. A blast of frigid air whipped from him, striking at Curran. The Beast Lord dodged again.</p><p>Dagfinn remained firmly planted. The last two times we\u2019d fought, he\u2019d moved at me and I\u2019d taken him down. There were dozens of ways to use an opponent\u2019s movement against him: trip him, knock him off balance, gain control of a shoulder or a leg, and so on. Dagfinn must\u2019ve decided not to give Curran that chance.</p><p>Dagfinn spun the axe. A barrage of frost missiles shot out. Curran leaped back and forth, circling Dagfinn. On the battlements the shapeshifters roared and howled.</p><p>\u201cHow are we doing, baby?\u201d I called out. Serves you right, Your Furriness. Next time, listen to me.</p><p>\u201cTrying not to show off,\u201d Curran yelled.</p><p>Dagfinn brought the axe down. A sonic boom smashed into me. Curran flew backward.</p><p>\u201cBring it!\u201d Dagfinn roared.</p><p>The shapeshifters booed.</p><p>Curran bounced back up and dashed forward.</p><p>Dagfinn spun, but the Beast Lord was too fast. He dodged left, right, and collided with Dagfinn. The huge Viking staggered back from the impact, whipped around, picking up momentum, and charged, roaring, gripping the axe with both hands, and bringing it up for an overhead blow.</p><p>Move, honey. Move.</p><p>Curran lunged forward.</p><p>What the hell was he doing?</p><p>Dagfinn chopped down with all his strength.</p><p>Curran caught the axe with his right hand.</p><p>Dagfinn stopped.</p><p>Holy shit.</p><p>The Viking strained, right leg forward, left leg back. Muscles rippled on his arms. Frost ate at Curran\u2019s hand, but the axe didn\u2019t move.</p><p>\u201cDone?\u201d Curran asked.</p><p>Dagfinn snarled.</p><p>Curran raised his left hand. His fingers curled into a fist.</p><p>\u201cNot in the head!\u201d I yelled. \u201cWe need his brain intact.\u201d</p><p>Curran yanked the axe forward. Dagfinn jerked back, trying to regain his balance, and Curran swept his left leg from under him. Dagfinn crashed down like an oak chopped at the root.</p><p>Curran tore the axe out of his hands and tossed it aside. Dagfinn swung at him with his right fist. Curran leaned out of the way and sank a vicious punch straight down into Dagfinn\u2019s gut.</p><p>Ow. I hurt just from looking. The shapeshifters watching on the wall made sucking noises.</p><p>Dagfinn curled into a ball, trying to gulp in a lungful of air, which was suddenly missing.</p><p>Curran pulled Dagfinn up, swung him over his shoulder, and carried the Viking toward me.</p><p>Oh, you crazy sonovabitch.</p><p>Curran dumped purple-faced Dagfinn by my feet. \u201cHere is your expert, baby.\u201d</p><p>The shapeshifters on the wall whistled and howled. Why me?</p><p>\u201cThanks, show-off,\u201d I told him. \u201cLet me see the hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hand, Curran.\u201d</p><p>He held it out. Blisters covered his right palm. Frostbite, probably second-degree. It had to hurt like hell. Lyc-V would fix it in a day or so, but meanwhile he\u2019d have to grit his teeth.</p><p>\u201cI said don\u2019t touch the axe.\u201d</p><p>He leaned over and kissed me. The shapeshifters on the walls cheered.</p><p>Dagfinn finally managed to remember how to breathe and swore.</p><p>I leaned over him. \u201cHe won. You\u2019re going to read my runes now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Dagfinn growled. \u201cGive me a minute. I think something\u2019s broken.\u201d</p><p>According to Doolittle, nothing was actually broken. Dagfinn treated the diagnosis with open suspicion, but given the circumstances, he decided to deal with it. Curran, on the other hand, got a plastic bag with some sort of healing solution tied around his hand. He liked it about as much as I expected.</p><p>\u201cThis is ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith the bag, the hand will be usable in two hours,\u201d Doolittle informed him. \u201cWithout the bag, it may be usable by tomorrow. It\u2019s your choice, my lord.\u201d</p><p>Curran growled a little, but kept the bag on.</p><p>I put Julie\u2019s drawing in front of Dagfinn. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He squinted at it. \u201cWhoa. Was this on a weapon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s on a gold necklace that\u2019s killing a child. Looks like Elder Futhark, but not exactly. Is this a spell?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t Elder Futhark.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s dvergr.\u201d</p><p>I sat down into the nearest chair. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>Dagfinn pulled back the sleeve of his tunic, displaying his tattoos. \u201cLook here.\u201d</p><p>The last two characters on his shoulder matched the last two characters on Julie\u2019s paper. Dagfinn drew his fingers along the tattoo. \u201cThis says, \u2018Wielder of Axe Aslaug, born from the blood of Earth shaped by the hands of Ivar.\u2019\u201d He tapped the paper. \u201cThis says, \u2018Apprentice of Ivar.\u2019 Yeah, I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat is dvergr?\u201d Curran asked me.</p><p>\u201cDwarf,\u201d I told him. \u201cOld Norse dwarf: magic, powerful, skilled with metalwork. Makers of weapons for the gods. They\u2019re often portrayed as embodiments of greed\u2014they lust after power, women, and most of all gold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey now!\u201d Dagfinn raised his hand. \u201cMost experts believe this to be a later development. The dwarf myths probably take their root in nature spirits...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDwarves like in Tolkien?\u201d Curran asked.</p><p>I wish. I dragged my hand over my face. \u201cOne time, four dwarf brothers, the sons of Ivaldi, created some magical gifts for the gods. Two other dwarf brothers, Brokk and Eiti, became jealous of all the praise and bet Loki, the trickster, that they could make better gifts. He wagered his head. The dwarves won and then wanted to murder Loki. The gods wouldn\u2019t let them do it, so Brokk sewed Loki\u2019s lips shut with wire. These are not the jolly, drink-beer-and-go-on-an-adventure type of dwarves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe one I met was a good guy,\u201d Dagfinn said.</p> <p>\u201cYou think the Ivar whose apprentice wore this necklace is the same Ivar who made your axe?\u201d Curran asked.</p><p>Dagfinn nodded. \u201cI was about fourteen or fifteen. I was wild back then, not like now.\u201d</p><p>Curran and I looked at each other.</p><p>\u201cSo my uncle Didrik, he was a Viking, took me to the mountains to this valley. We met a smith there and my uncle talked to him and then left me there for the summer. It didn\u2019t go well at first, but Ivar and me got along finally. I liked it there. When Didrik came to get me, Ivar made me this axe and put the runes on me. Right arm\u201d\u2014he slapped his right biceps\u2014 \u201ccontrols the axe. Left arm is my oath. I can\u2019t ever kill a defenseless person or force myself on anyone, or the axe will turn on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard you broke into the monastery looking for Asian ladies,\u201d Curran said.</p><p>\u201cAsian ale,\u201d Dagfinn said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t looking to rape anybody. I was looking for the beer. None of them would talk to me, so I kept trying to grab them to make them hold still so I could ask where the beer was. I had a bit to drink that evening.\u201d</p><p>The light dawned on me. \u201cDagfinn, they are Buddhists. They don\u2019t brew beer. You needed the Augustine Brothers two miles to the south. You went to the wrong monastery, you dimwit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me something I don\u2019t know,\u201d Dagfinn growled. \u201cAnyway, can I see this collar?\u201d</p> <p>We took him in to see the boy. Roderick shrank a little. \u201cDon\u2019t be scared,\u201d Dagfinn said. He examined the collar for a little while and we returned to the other room. Dagfinn sat down in his chair, while Curran leaned against the wall, watching him and emanating menace.</p><p>\u201cCould be Ivar\u2019s work,\u201d Dagfinn said. \u201cI just don\u2019t understand why. The dwarf I knew wouldn\u2019t hurt a child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about his apprentice,\u201d I asked. \u201cWhat do you know about him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever met him, but it looks like this collar must have belonged to him or at least his apprentice. Maybe Ivar will know more, if we can locate him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you find the valley again?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cThere is a trick to it somehow. I\u2019d meant to ask Didrik about it, but he died. I\u2019ve tried to find him on my own. I\u2019ve been all over the Smoky Mountains and nothing.\u201d</p><p>He was holding something back, I could feel it. \u201cWhat are you not telling me, Dagfinn?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to kill the kid,\u201d Curran said.</p><p>\u201cHe might know,\u201d Dagfinn said.</p><p>\u201cHe who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know. He.\u201d</p><p>My heart took a dive. This was getting better and better.</p><p>\u201cHe who?\u201d Curran demanded.</p><p>I stepped closer to him and lowered my voice. \u201cThe Vikings know of a creature. He\u2019s been trapped on their land for a very long time. They don\u2019t like to say his name, because he might hear and kill them at night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019re thinking about it,\u201d Dagfinn said.</p><p>I spread my arms. \u201cI\u2019m out of ideas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKate, please tell me you haven\u2019t been to see him before, right? Right?\u201d Dagfinn asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. This will be my first time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Curran asked.</p><p>\u201cHe catches your scent when you go to see him,\u201d Dagfinn said. \u201cIt takes him a while, but once he learns the scent, he never forgets it. People who go to see him twice don\u2019t come back. Their bones stay on that hill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to need backup,\u201d I said, thinking aloud.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look at me,\u201d Dagfinn said. \u201cI like you and all, but I\u2019ve been once. I ran like a little girl and barely got out. I can\u2019t go again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBackup won\u2019t be an issue,\u201d Curran said.</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cWe can\u2019t bring anyone we can\u2019t afford to lose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s right,\u201d Dagfinn said. \u201cI hired a crew. Six people. I was the only one who got out and only because he ate them first. My advice, hire someone you don\u2019t know and tell them up front it\u2019s a fight to the death. They\u2019re just flesh speed bumps for him.\u201d He looked at me. \u201cYou need to talk to the Cherokees.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know.\u201d Thinking of going to see H\u00e5kon sent ice down my spine.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m out.\u201d Dagfinn rose. \u201cThank you for the fight, I had fun, we should do it again sometime. It was nice knowing you.\u201d</p><p>Curran pushed from the wall. \u201cI\u2019ll walk you out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can find my way,\u201d Dagfinn said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you can. I\u2019ll save you the trouble.\u201d Gold rolled over Curran\u2019s eyes.</p><p>Dagfinn sighed and they left.</p><p>I went up onto the roof. We had set up a small dining area there, two chairs and a table. Lately, every time we sat down to eat in our kitchen, someone would knock on the door with some bullshit emergency, so when we didn\u2019t feel like being interrupted, Curran and I would go up to the roof and eat in peace. His Furry Majesty was threatening to drag a grill up there and \u201ccook meat\u201d for me. Knowing him, \u201cgrill\u201d meant a giant pit and \u201cmeat\u201d stood for half a deer.</p><p>I sat on the low stone wall bordering the top of the roof. It was late afternoon, and the sun was slowly rolling to the west. The stone wall was nice and hot under my butt. Summer was coming.</p><p>I sat, enveloped in warm air. It felt nice, but not hot enough to chase away the ice built up on my spine. I didn\u2019t want to visit H\u00e5kon. Several people I knew had gone to see him. Only two had come back, and Dagfinn was one of them.</p><p>The world blinked. The magic vanished, snuffed out like a candle by a draft. A mixed blessing: as long as the magic was down, the necklace wouldn\u2019t constrict Roderick\u2019s neck any further, but we couldn\u2019t see H\u00e5kon without it.</p><p>Voron, my adoptive father, had always warned me that friends would make me soft. When you cared about people, you forged a bond, and that bond made you predictable. Friends weren\u2019t for me. Greg, my now-dead guardian, took that a step further and added lovers to that ban. When you loved someone, your enemies would use it against you.</p><p>Neither of them had predicted that being in love and being loved in return made you value your life much higher. I liked my life. I had a lot to lose now.</p><p>Curran emerged from the door, pulled the bag off his hand, and tossed it into the garbage can we kept up here for the times we ate outside. He walked in complete silence, like a tiger stalking through the forest, quiet and confident. I liked to watch him, provided he didn\u2019t know about it. His ego was threatening the ozone layer as it was.</p><p>Curran sat next to me and put his left arm around my shoulders and kissed me. There was a slightly possessive edge to the kiss.</p><p>\u201cThrough the Guild and no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYou were about to ask how I know Dagfinn and if we were ever more than friends. We never were friends, actually. I got suckered by the Guild into bringing him in twice. He was wanted for unpaid fines and destruction of property.\u201d</p><p>Curran grimaced. \u201cNo, it never crossed my mind that you\u2019d be with Dagfinn. He\u2019s an undisciplined idiot. Give me some credit. I know you better than that.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged and leaned closer against him. \u201cThis is fucked up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it is. Can you think of any other way to find Ivar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Maybe Doolittle can try removing the collar during tech?\u201d</p><p>Curran shook his head. \u201cI asked. He says it will kill the boy. He says we have thirty-six to forty-eight hours, depending on how long the magic lasts. There is a good chance the next magic wave will be the boy\u2019s last.\u201d</p><p>Two days before Roderick with his owlish eyes died, choked to death.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember a few years ago a detachment of PAD disappeared? Eleven cops, armed to the teeth? It was in the papers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was H\u00e5kon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that his name?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cI didn\u2019t say it in front of Dagfinn so he wouldn\u2019t freak out. Whoever we take will die. If we don\u2019t take anybody, the boy will die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe explain it and ask for volunteers.\u201d Curran drew me closer. \u201cThose are the choices we make.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m tired of those lousy choices.\u201d If you put all the people I\u2019d killed together, their blood would make a lake.

Assuming Curran survived.</p> <p>The thought pissed me off. We\u2019d do it. There was a child on the other end of that equation, so yes, we would grit our teeth and do it. But it made me so mad. I could\u2019ve strangled Aurellia if I got my hands on her. She knew what the collar did, and she had deliberately chosen between her husband and her son.</p><p>\u201cCan H\u00e5kon be killed?\u201d Curran asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. The Cherokees have tried for years. All they can do is contain him on that hill. If he\u2019s destroyed, he just reassembles himself.\u201d I growled. \u201cI don\u2019t want to do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cDo you think less of me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d Curran stroked my back. \u201cLike I said, these are the choices we make, and sometimes every choice is bad, and then you sit by yourself and remember all the horrible shit you had to do and have done, and you deal with it. It will eat you alive if you let it.\u201d</p><p>I straightened and touched his cheek. \u201cWell, you don\u2019t have to sit by yourself anymore. We\u2019ll sit together.\u201d</p><p>He caught my hand and kissed it. His eyes turned dark. His fingers curved into a fist. He looked predatory. \u201cI wish I could rewind back to that second and crush her skull before she put the necklace on the kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I wish there was a way to get to her.\u201d</p><p>He looked at me. \u201cI thought about it. If we approached Forney\u2019s house at night...\u201d</p><p>\u201cCurran, we can\u2019t break into the house of the DA. The fallout for the Pack would be enormous.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know, I know.\u201d Muscles played along his jaw. He hated to have his hands tied and so did I. \u201cBut if we use someone outside of Atlanta for the DA job...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a bad idea. Even I know it\u2019s a bad idea.\u201d</p><p>He looked at me. He was still thinking about it.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I told him.</p><p>Curran swore.</p><p>Screwing with the DA would get us a witch hunt in a hurry. He knew it and I knew it. No, there had to be another way. Some way where the boy survived and our people didn\u2019t die.</p><p>I sighed. \u201cI envy navigators sometimes. All they do is sit in the Casino and drink coffee, while the bloodsuckers run into dang\u2014\u201d</p><p>I stopped in midword.</p> <p>Curran\u2019s eyes lit up.</p><p>\u201cYou think he\u2019ll go for it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes. Yes, he will go for it.\u201d He jumped off the wall. \u201cCome with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t we have some sort of a plan? Ghastek isn\u2019t an idiot. We can\u2019t just call down to the Casino and tell him, \u2018Hi, we\u2019re going on a suicide mission, wanna bring some vampires to be our bullet meat?\u2019\u201d Bloodsuckers were expensive. The very idea of taking four or five of them into danger with minuscule chances of survival would give Ghastek an aneurysm.</p><p>\u201cI have a plan.\u201d Curran grinned at me.</p><p>\u201cPlease enlighten me, Your Majesty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to make Jim figure it out,\u201d Curran said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it? That\u2019s your plan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019m brilliant. Come on.\u201d</p><p>I hopped off the wall and we went down the stairs.</p><p>If anybody could figure out how to rope Ghastek into this scheme, Jim would be the man. Served him right for all those times he\u2019d pushed me into the line of fire.</p><p>Payback is a bitch.</p><p>We trapped Jim in one of the conference rooms and explained our brilliant plan.</p><p>\u201cThis is payback, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Jim glared at me.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous,\u201d I told him. \u201cAs the Consort of the Pack, I\u2019m far above petty revenge.\u201d</p><p>Jim tapped the clipboard with several pieces of paper on it against his forearm. \u201cI\u2019ll do it if you go to the Guild tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll do it, because I asked you to,\u201d Curran said.</p><p>Jim turned to me. \u201cWill you do the Guild thing?\u201d</p><p>I had a dying kid on my hands and all he cared about was Guild idiocy. \u201cMaybe. I don\u2019t know yet. I\u2019m kind of busy at the moment.\u201d</p><p>Green flashed in Jim\u2019s eyes. He yanked a piece of paper from the clipboard and thrust it at me. It looked like a long list.</p><p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is the list of all the phone calls I\u2019ve gotten about this shit in the last week and a half. The mercs have gotten every damn member to call me here.\u201d He shook the list in Curran\u2019s direction. \u201cYou want to know why your background checks aren\u2019t done? This is why! I could get it done if your mate would stop dicking around and just deal with it.\u201d</p><p>Oh, it\u2019s like this, then. \u201cThen I have a great idea. Since they\u2019re all calling you, why don\u2019t you stop dicking around and deal with the Guild. You have the same time in as I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a job!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do I! Why is your time more important than mine?\u201d</p><p>The clipboard snapped in Jim\u2019s fingers. He dropped it on the ground and raised his hands. \u201cYou know what, I\u2019m done. I quit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God, seriously?\u201d</p><p>Jim wiped his hands against each other and showed them to me.</p><p>\u201cIs that you washing your hands off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? So what, you\u2019re going to retire and open that flower shop you always wanted?\u201d</p><p>Jim\u2019s eyes went completely green.</p><p>\u201cEnough,\u201d Curran said. An unmistakable command saturated his voice. Jim clicked his mouth shut.</p><p>I crossed my arms. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, is this the part where I fall to my knees and shiver in fear, Your Furriness? Silly me, I didn\u2019t get the memo.\u201d</p><p>Curran ignored the barb. \u201cWhat\u2019s your problem with the Guild?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only way to resolve it involves me being entangled in running it and I don\u2019t want to do it.\u201d I waved my arms. \u201cI have the Consort crap and I have the Cutting Edge crap and whatever other bullshit the two of you throw my way. I don\u2019t want to go to the Guild every month and deal with their crap on top of everything else.\u201d</p><p>Curran leaned toward me. \u201cI have to dress up and meet with those corpse fuckers once every three months and be civil while we\u2019re eating at the same table. You can deal with the Guild.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, dress up? Wow, I had no idea that putting on your formal sweatpants was such a huge burden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKate,\u201d Curran snarled. \u201cThey\u2019re not sweatpants, they are slacks and they have a belt. I have to wear shoes with fucking laces in them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to do it! I hate the ceremony crap.\u201d I so didn\u2019t need the Guild politics in my life. It was complicated enough, damn it. \u201cI don\u2019t have time for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverybody hates the political stuff,\u201d Curran growled. \u201cYou\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me one reason why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you know those people and some of them are your friends. The Guild is sinking and they\u2019re losing their jobs.\u201d</p><p>I opened my mouth and clamped it shut.</p><p>\u201cAlso, because I\u2019m asking you to do it,\u201d Curran said. \u201cWill you please resolve this, baby?\u201d</p><p>I would punch him. I would punch him straight in the face, hard. \u201cFine. I\u2019ll need a lot of backup for the Guild.\u201d</p><p>Curran looked at Jim. \u201cMake sure she has everything she needs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Jim said. He picked up the pieces of his clipboard, pulled a piece of paper out, and handed it to me with the pen. \u201cWrite it down.\u201d</p><p>I did and gave it back to him.</p><p>Jim read it. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of it, Consort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Alpha.\u201d</p><p>If it had been raining, our voices would\u2019ve frozen it into hail.</p><p>\u201cIs there anything else?\u201d Jim asked Curran.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Jim nodded and left.</p><p>\u201cI hate you,\u201d I told Curran.</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cYou\u2019d hate me more if Jim quit. We\u2019d have to find a replacement. I don\u2019t trust that many people. Just think how much more shit you\u2019d have to put up with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d I warned him.</p><p>\u201cMhm, Kate, the chief of security. Sexy. Who better to guard my body than the woman who owns it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCurran, I will punch you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRough play.\u201d Curran pretended to shiver in excitement.</p><p>I raised my fist and tapped his biceps lightly.</p><p>\u201cYou knew it was inevitable,\u201d he said.</p><p>I knew. The moment Jim sent me the file I had known exactly how it would end. But I\u2019d put up a valiant fight. \u201cYes, but I don\u2019t have to like it. Can we eat now? I\u2019m starving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh so am I forgiven?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cSure. The next time you decide to flex your claws and come up with a plan to invade the home of a high-ranking civil servant, I\u2019ll bark, \u2018Enough!\u2019 and expect to be obeyed, how about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told me no,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I didn\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t assault the DA\u2019s house, you crazy bastard!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you can\u2019t check out of the Guild\u2019s mess. We both have to do things we don\u2019t want to do. I consider us even.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes and we went upstairs to our cold food.</p><p>\u201cI know what that ass is getting from me next Christmas,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cClipboards. Lots and lots of clipboards.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 8</p><p>Before the Shift and the return of magic, a person\u2019s power could be readily judged by the kind of car they drove, by the clothes they wore, and the company they kept. In post-Shift Atlanta, visual clues still proved true in some cases, but not nearly often enough. A bum in tattered jeans and ragged cloak could walk out into a crowded street, raise his arms, and the sky would tear open and weep a rain of lightning and hail the size of coconuts, leveling everything in a three-mile radius. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>That\u2019s why post-Shift Atlanta\u2019s movers and shakers preferred both a show of power and dressing to impress. Still, if you did dress like a badass, you had better be able to back it up.</p><p>When I woke up in the morning, a pair of gray jeans, a gray T-shirt, and a gray leather jacket waited for me, folded on top of a gray cloak edged with fur. Just as I requested. Gray was the Pack color. I was going to put on a show for the Guild and this was my costume for it. I put the clothes on, added my boots, my saber in the back leather sheath, my throwing knives, and my wrist guards filled with silver needles. I braided my hair away from my face and examined myself in the mirror. I was broadcasting dangerous loud and clear.</p><p>Normally I stayed away from clothes like that. The less attention I drew when I worked, the better. Most mercs knew I was good at my job, but I wasn\u2019t very impressive. I didn\u2019t put on a show. Some of them had problems with me, most didn\u2019t. Today was different. Today I needed to be less Kate Daniels and more Pack Consort. I needed to knock them off balance, so they wouldn\u2019t question why I showed up there and told them what to do.</p> <p>I marched into the bathroom, where Curran was brushing his teeth. His blond eyebrows crept up. \u201cThat\u2019s your Council meeting outfit from now on.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cCloak or no cloak?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely cloak,\u201d he said.</p><p>I tried the cloak on in front of the mirror.</p><p>Curran came up behind me and nuzzled my neck.</p> <p>\u201cIs that your gun or are you just happy to see me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMhm, a challenge.\u201d He nipped the skin on the back of my neck, sending electric aftershocks down through me. Some men got excited by white lace and a translucent negligee. My love muffin got excited by a woman dressed to murder. There was probably something deeply twisted about that. Lucky for me, negligees were never my thing.</p><p>He kissed me again. \u201cYou\u2019re finally getting the hang of this whole badass thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was always badass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you thought you were badass and talked a lot of crap.\u201d He wrapped his arms around me.</p><p>Aha. \u201cLet me go.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou have time.\u201d He kissed my neck again. Every nerve in my body came to attention.</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t. I have people waiting.\u201d I pulled free from him and kissed him back. He pulled me close, locking me within his arms. Mhm, Curran. I really didn\u2019t want to leave.</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Have to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t take long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho would that be fun for, exactly? Your seducing techniques need work.\u201d I untangled myself and escaped, before he thought of something else to say to change my mind.</p><p>It took me ten minutes to stop by the medical ward.</p><p>Roderick\u2019s collar has faded to lemon yellow. The skin around it had turned bright red, inflamed. It hurt just to look at it. I crouched by him. \u201cHow are you doing?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m okay, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it hurt to eat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to see someone today to figure out how to take that thing off.\u201d</p><p>He just looked at me with his big eyes. Deep down, he must\u2019ve been scared. His sister had died. His parents were gone. But he held it all inside and he wasn\u2019t about to let me in.</p><p>Before I left, Doolittle drew me aside. His face was bleak. \u201cYou must hurry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do my best,\u201d I told him.</p><p>When I walked into the morning light, ten Pack vehicles waited for me. The crews of the vehicles stood in front of them wearing identical gray. Jim stood to the side, surveying the troops. I approached him.</p><p>\u201cSatisfied, Consort?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long are you going to be pissed off?\u201d I asked him. We both kept our voices low.</p><p>He stared straight ahead.</p><p>\u201cJim, we had a verbal disagreement. I was an ass, but you withheld information. The way you\u2019re acting, you\u2019d think I got some guys to jump you and work you over until you woke up with bites on your legs and bruises all over your body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s different now, because we\u2019re both Pack. I\u2019ve told you I was sorry about that. Are you going to keep dragging it out every time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a shitty thing to do.\u201d</p><p>He locked his teeth, making his jaw muscles bulge.</p><p>I sighed and started toward the cars. \u201cSuit yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always do,\u201d he called out.</p><p>I turned around and flipped him off.</p><p>He glared at me.</p><p>I kept walking.</p><p>\u201cKate!\u201d he called out.</p><p>I turned.</p><p>\u201cEduardo is your second. You need to talk to him. He wants you to practice something.\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>\u201cKate!\u201d</p><p>I turned around.</p><p>Jim approached me. \u201cDo you need me to watch your back for this Guild thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got it. Thanks,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cAnytime.\u201d</p><p>I went in search of Eduardo. Jim was an ornery bastard, but he did have my back. At least he wasn\u2019t mad anymore. I would probably have to make a peace offering all the same. The werejaguars were difficult creatures.</p><p>I\u2019d have to get Dali to help me pick a gift. That way there would be no misunderstandings.</p><p>The Mercenary Guild made its headquarters in a converted Sheraton Hotel on the edge of Buckhead. In another life the hotel, built as a hollow tower, had a solid glass front, complete with a rotating glass door. Now massive steel gates marked the entrance. As our procession rolled up to the hotel, I could see a few mercs milling about and smoking. Most of the Guild personnel were probably inside already. Perfect.</p><p>Next to me, Eduardo leaned forward in the Jeep\u2019s driver seat. A werebuffalo from Clan Heavy, he was over six feet tall and layered with thick muscle. His hair fell down his back in a black mane. His square chin and deep-set eyes said that he would rather die than back down. That impression was one hundred percent correct. I had a problem with a part of his plan and argued with him about it until I turned blue in the face, but he wouldn\u2019t budge, which was probably why Jim had assigned him to be my second for this venture.</p><p>\u201cWait until we line up before you go in, Consort,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cKate.\u201d We\u2019d been on a first-name basis for a while now.</p><p>\u201cNot today, Consort.\u201d</p><p>The ten Jeeps turned in unison, parking next to each other in front of the building. The mercs at the entrance forgot to suck at their cigarettes and stared.</p><p>The car doors opened. The shapeshifters stepped out, forming two lines with a military precision, their faces solemn. I glanced at Eduardo.</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d he said.</p><p>The shapeshifters marched into the Sheraton, looking like they would chew through anybody dumb enough to stand in their way.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to get out and go ahead. Derek will open your door. When you exit, keep walking, like you own the place,\u201d Eduardo said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got your back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch it, bison,\u201d Jezebel growled from the backseat. She was one of the two bouda advisors Aunt B, the alpha of the werehyenas, had attached to me. \u201cYou talk to her like she\u2019s a child.\u201d</p><p>I held up my hand. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I got it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo worries,\u201d Eduardo said. \u201cYou\u2019ll do fine.\u201d</p><p>There were few things I hated more than being the center of attention. Especially if the crowd was large.</p><p>Eduardo stepped outside. The passenger door behind me opened and Jezebel and Derek got out. Jezebel was six feet tall, moved like a predator, and had enough hard muscle on her to make me think twice about trying to take her on. Derek was leaner and younger, but his face and bearing made an instant impression.</p><p>Derek opened the door. \u201cMy lady.\u201d</p><p>The arrogant, self-assured face of my aunt flashed before me. I would be Erra for today.</p><p>Eduardo stomped toward the Sheraton like a mountain with a \u201cmake my day\u201d face.</p><p>I stepped out and marched on the Guild, imagining there was an army at my back.</p><p>Eduardo cleared the iron gates, sucked in a lungful of air, and roared. \u201cMake way for the Consort!\u201d</p><p>Oh boy.</p><p>Eduardo stood to the side. I strode through the gates and the lobby. Eduardo fell in behind me.</p><p>Before the Shift, the hotel was a many-star establishment, complete with an on-the-premises restaurant, a coffee shop, and a happy hour area raised on a three-foot platform. Mercs filled the main floor now. The twin lines of shapeshifters had sliced through the crowd, forming an empty corridor leading toward the platform. They stood like statues, hands behind their backs, feet together. A lone table waited for me. Mark sat on the left, his face pale. On the right Bob Carver and Ivera gawked at me with owl eyes.</p><p>I walked to the platform with my head held high, my cloak flaring. The entirety of the Guild focused on me. Super.</p><p>At the platform Eduardo sped up, drawing even with me. He took a knee, locked his left fist on his right wrist, and offered me the makeshift step.</p><p>Do not fall, do not fall, do not fall...</p><p>Without breaking my stride, I stepped onto his arms and then onto the platform.</p><p>We\u2019d practiced it at least two dozen times before we had left for the Guild.</p><p>The three shapeshifters\u2014Derek, Eduardo, and Jezebel\u2014turned, their backs to the platform, and glowered at the crowd. Derek carried a large wooden box. The two lines of shapeshifters stepped to the left as one, snapping into a wider stance.</p><p>Someone gasped.</p><p>Showtime.</p><p>\u201cI speak for the Pack,\u201d I said, putting all my power into my voice. \u201cWe hold twenty percent of the Guild. The admin group holds forty. The veterans hold another forty.\u201d</p><p>You could hear a pin drop.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve had months to choose a leader. You have failed and asked the Pack to break this deadlock. This is my proposal to the Guild. Listen well, because there won\u2019t be another.\u201d</p><p>They were listening. Thank you, Universe, for small favors.</p><p>\u201cSolomon Red envisioned this Guild as a place for independent men and women to earn their living in the way they see fit. We must continue the course he plotted for us.\u201d</p><p>It was bullshit. Solomon Red didn\u2019t have that grand of a vision, but Curran had suggested it, so I plowed on ahead. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPoint One.

The shapeshifter at the end of the left line stepped forward and unfolded a small table.

Don\u2019t blow it.\u201d</p> <p>Two hours later, two hundred and forty-six mercs voted yes, thirty-two voted no, and sixty-one dropped blank cards with their IDs into the box, abstaining. I made a show of congratulating Bob and Mark and got the hell out of there.</p><p>CHAPTER 9</p><p>I went to see Immokalee, a Cherokee medicine woman, after leaving the Guild. She spent half an hour making supplies for me and another half an hour trying to convince me that going to see the draugr was a Bad Idea. I knew it was a Bad Idea. I just didn\u2019t see any way around it.</p><p>I got to the Cutting Edge office just after noon. The Dude and a cart containing one very sedated deer waited for me in the parking lot. A female shapeshifter I didn\u2019t know sat on the cart with a sour expression on her face. It took me only a moment to figure out why. Next to the cart, hiding in the shade, crouched a vampire. It was thin, wiry, and covered in purple sunblock from head to toe, as if some giant bubble of grape bubblegum had exploded over it.</p><p>Jim had done it. I felt like jumping up and down. Instead I gave the vamp my flat stare.</p> <p>\u201cThere are more inside,\u201d the female shapeshifter informed me.</p><p>I stepped into the office. Curran sat at my desk, drinking a Corona from my fridge. In front of him, four vampires sat in a neat row in the middle of the floor. Two matched the purple delight outside, one was Grinch green, and the last one blazed with orange.</p><p>\u201cI get the sunblock,\u201d I said. \u201cBut why do you have to paint them like Skittles?\u201d</p><p>The orange vamp unhinged its jaws. \u201cThe bright color helps to make sure they\u2019re completely covered,\u201d an unfamiliar female voice explained. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to miss a spot. When they\u2019re young, they have a lot of wrinkles.\u201d</p><p>Ugh. \u201cWhat is the meaning of this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKate,\u201d the green vamp spoke with Ghastek\u2019s voice, \u201cit has come to my attention that you are planning to see a creature in the Viking territory with the purpose of finding a means to remove the necklace from the child. An undead creature. That explicitly violates the terms of our agreement to resolve this matter jointly.\u201d</p> <p>I looked at Curran. He shrugged.</p><p>\u201cAnd how did you know this?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cI have my methods.\u201d</p><p>How in the world had Jim pulled this off? I\u2019d have to buy him all the clipboards in the world.</p><p>\u201cGhastek, this is not a pleasure trip,\u201d Curran said.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t go,\u201d I added.</p><p>\u201cWhy ever not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause this undead will murder your vampire hit squad and I have no desire to get that bill,\u201d Curran said. \u201cDo yourself a favor. Sit this one out.\u201d</p> <p>Wow. He went there.</p><p>The vamp\u2019s red eyes bulged, struggling to mirror Ghastek\u2019s expression.</p><p>\u201cKate, perhaps you need to explain to your significant other that he is in no position to give me orders. Last time I checked, his title was Beast Lord, which is a gentle euphemism for a man who strips naked at night and runs around through the woods hunting small woodland creatures. I\u2019m a premier Master of the Dead. I will go where I please.\u201d</p><p>Once again I rode The Dude. Curran chose to drive the cart. We traveled side by side. Ghastek took point, while three of his journeymen flanked us. The fourth, the orange vampire, trotted next to me. It was piloted by Ghastek\u2019s top journeywoman. Her name was Tracy and as navigators went, she wasn\u2019t too bad.</p><p>Ghastek\u2019s vampire reached Gunnar\u2019s fork, marked by an old birch. Predictably, Gunnar lumbered out. \u201cCome to see Ragnvald again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoing to the glade.\u201d I nodded at the cart. The deer\u2019s moist dark eyes stared at the Viking.</p><p>Gunnar\u2019s spine went rigid. \u201cTo see him?\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI have to.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head and stepped aside. \u201cIt\u2019s been nice knowing you.\u201d</p><p>I touched the reins and our small procession rolled on.</p><p>Ghastek dropped back, drawing even with The Dude. \u201cWhy the secrecy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Vikings don\u2019t like to say H\u00e5kon\u2019s name. The glade isn\u2019t that far from here and he might hear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is he?\u201d</p><p>He and Curran had that in common. Wave a secret in front of them and they would foam at the mouth trying to learn it. \u201cHe\u2019s a draugr.\u201d</p><p>The vamp hopped on the cart and peered at me, its eyes only a couple of inches from my face. \u201cA draugr? A mythical Norse undead that\u2019s supposed to guard the treasure of its grave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet off my cart,\u201d Curran growled.</p><p>The undead hopped down. The vampire\u2019s grotesque face twisted into an odd expression: the corners of its cavernous mouth pinched up, while its lips gaped open, displaying its fangs. It stared at me with blood-red eyes and bopped its head forward and back a few times.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m laughing at you.\u201d</p><p>Kicking the vampire in the face with my foot would be counterproductive at this point.</p><p>\u201cWhen I was a journeyman, I spent eighteen months in Norway, looking for draugar. I\u2019ve camped in cemeteries in sub-zero temperatures, I\u2019ve scoured fjords, I\u2019ve dived into sea caves in freezing water. It was the worst year and a half of my life. In those eighteen months I didn\u2019t find any credible evidence of the existence of draugar. Trust me when I say this: they don\u2019t exist. Hence, my use of the word \u2018mythical.\u2019 As in, \u2018not real.\u2019\u201d</p><p>I briefly contemplated punching the vampire in the nose. It wouldn\u2019t hurt Ghastek any, but it would be immensely satisfying. \u201cThis draugr exists. Plenty of people have met him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I have no doubt that they have met something, but it wasn\u2019t a draugr. Don\u2019t you see the signs? The mysterious glade, the path to which is guarded by a giant. The legendary undead with magical powers, who you can only meet once, and those who disobey that rule die a gruesome death.\u201d The vampire waved his front limbs, fingers spread. \u201cWoo-ooo. Frightening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have a point?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose bearded, horn-helmeted bandits are conning you, Kate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to feel bad about this. You\u2019re a capable fighter, proficient with a blade, and you have intelligence and tenacity, but you don\u2019t work with the undead. You have very little familiarity with the basic principles of necromancy, beyond its most practical applications. You lack the tools to recognize the hoax.\u201d</p><p>The urge to grab the mind of the nearest vampire and use it to beat Ghastek\u2019s vamp to a bloody pulp was overwhelming. Perhaps that was why Voron had insisted on steering me away from necromancy. He\u2019d known there would be times that the temptation to show off would be too much.</p><p>\u201cNo worries. It\u2019s a forgivable mistake,\u201d Ghastek said. \u201cHowever, it\u2019ll cost us a day and the use of five vampires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHumor me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I intend to. I\u2019ve had a stressful day and breaking this farce open will prove a wonderful way to vent the pressure.\u201d</p><p>The vampire sauntered off.</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t like to be wrong,\u201d Tracy\u2019s vamp said. I caught a hint of humor in her voice.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t care less if he liked it. As long as his vampires stood between me and the draugr, it would buy me a couple of extra seconds to get away.</p><p>The old road led deeper and deeper into the forest. The trees grew taller and thicker, their long limbs thrusting at each other, as if trying to push their neighbors out of the way. Mist swirled between the trunks, first an ethereal haze shimmering along the ground, then a thicker blue fog that hugged the road, lying in wait. It swallowed the sounds: the hoofbeats of the horses, the creaking of the cart, and the occasional sigh from the deer in the back. All seemed muted.</p><p>Ahead a stone arch rose above the path, gray slabs of rocks tinted with moss. I halted The Dude. The cart rocked to a stop.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a path leading north just past the arch. We go on foot from here.\u201d I hopped off the cart. \u201cI need one of you to carry the deer.\u201d</p><p>A purple bloodsucker crawled up on the cart. Sickle claws sliced at the rope securing the animal, and the vampire pulled the deer off and slung it over its shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWhich way will you be coming on the way back?\u201d Curran asked.</p><p>\u201cThe glade is northeast from here.\u201d I pointed to a tall oak to the left.</p><p>Curran pulled me close.</p><p>Ghastek\u2019s vampire rolled his eyes.</p><p>\u201cRemember the plan?\u201d Curran said in my ear.</p><p>\u201cGet in, get the information, and run like hell out of there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee you in a few hours.\u201d</p><p>I brushed his lips with mine. \u201cSee you.\u201d</p><p>I grabbed my backpack and headed up the path.</p><p>The mist grew thicker. Moisture hung in the air, tinted with the odor of rotting vegetation and fresh soil. Somewhere in the distance a bird screamed. No movement troubled the still woods. No squirrels chattered in the canopy, no small game scurried away at our approach. Nothing stirred except for the vampires gliding alongside the path, their emaciated shapes flashing between the trees. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The path veered right and opened into a small glade. Tall pines framed it, the enormous dark trunks scratching at the sky. A carpet of dark pines needles sheathed the ground. Here and there rocks thrust from the forest floor.</p><p>\u201cPut the deer right there.\u201d I pointed to the center of the glade. The vampire unloaded the deer and hopped aside.</p><p>\u201cI suppose we wait until the magic returns?\u201d Ghastek inquired.</p> <p>\u201cYou got it.\u201d I sat on a fallen pine.</p><p>The vampire\u2019s shoulders rose up and down. Ghastek must\u2019ve sighed. \u201cI suppose we might as well treat this seriously.\u201d The vampire raised his left forelimb. A long yellow claw pointed at a tall birch on the left. \u201cObservation Post there.\u201d A claw moved to the right to a pine on the other side of the glade. \u201cAnother OP there. Give me a perimeter assessment.\u201d</p><p>Two purple vampires scattered, took a running start, and scrambled up the indicated trees. The third dashed into the bushes. Only Ghastek and Tracy remained. His vampire sat on my right, her vampire sat on my left. Peachy.</p><p>A minute passed. Another.</p><p>Ghastek\u2019s vamp lay down. \u201cIf half of the things said about draugar were true, it would revolutionize necromantic science. According to legend, they\u2019re the spirits of warriors who rise from the grave to guard their buried possessions. They see the future, they control the elements, they shapeshift into animals. They turn into smoke and become giants.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot at the same time,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said they turn into smoke and become giants. Not at the same time. They\u2019re solid in giant form.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still clinging to this fallacy?\u201d</p><p>I leaned forward. \u201cWhat would you have done if you had found a draugr in Norway, Ghastek?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d have tried to apprehend it, of course.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSuppose you live in a small village in Norway and you know a draugr is nearby. You bring him live game once in a while and you hope to God he leaves you the hell alone. Now some geeky hotshot foreigner shows up on your doorstep and explains to you how he\u2019s going to go annoy this terrible creature for the sake of \u2018necromantic science.\u2019 You try to explain to him that it\u2019s not a good idea, but he treats you as if you\u2019re an idiot child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never treat people like infantile idiots,\u201d Ghastek said.</p><p>I looked at him.</p><p>Tracy cleared her throat carefully.</p><p>\u201cGo on,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWould you take this foreigner to this undead monster and risk pissing it off, or would you steer him as far away from the draugr as possible and hope he\u2019ll go away eventually?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a sound theory, with one exception. I\u2019m not that gullible.\u201d</p><p>Fine. \u201cBet me.\u201d</p> <p>The vampire stared at me. \u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBet me. If the draugr is a hoax, I\u2019ll owe you a favor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if he\u2019s real?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you will bring me a quart of vampire blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why would you need vampire blood, Kate?\u201d</p><p>Because I needed it to experiment with making armor out of it, that\u2019s why. \u201cI want to calibrate the lot of new m-scanners the Pack bought.\u201d He didn\u2019t need to know I was practicing to see how much of Roland\u2019s talent had passed to me.</p><p>A hint of suspicion slid into Ghastek\u2019s voice. \u201cAnd you need a quart of blood for that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>The bloodsucker became utterly still as Ghastek mulled it over.</p><p>\u201cIf I win this silly game, you will tell me why Rowena came to see you after the Keepers affair.\u201d</p><p>Sucker. \u201cDeal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent.\u201d He put emphasis on the \u201cx\u201d and the word came out slightly sibilant.</p><p>\u201cYou need a fluffy white cat. That way you can stroke it when you say things like that.\u201d</p><p>Tracy\u2019s vamp made a small noise that might have been a clearing of a throat or a choked-up laugh.</p><p>A purple vampire popped out of the bushes, dragging something behind it. The bloodsucker strained, tight muscle flexing across its back, and heaved what looked like a large collapsed leather tent into the open.</p><p>\u201cWe found human bones,\u201d the vampire reported.</p><p>\u201cIn the ravine?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>I knew about the spot. Immokalee had described it to me this morning, trying to scare me into not going. A few dozen yards to the north, the ground dropped sharply into a narrow fissure lined with human skeletons. Some still held their weapons. When a draugr sucked the flesh off your bones, he did it quick, like jerking a shirt off a body.</p><p>\u201cWe also found this.\u201d The vampire indicated the tent.</p><p>Ghastek\u2019s vampire raised the top edge, exposing a dark opening, and vanished into it. The leather shifted, mirroring the vampire\u2019s movement inside it. The bloodsucker emerged into the clear air. \u201cThe design is ill-conceived. It is clearly too large for one person, but it has no structure or method of remaining upright as a tent, and besides, this side is completely open to the elements. Perhaps it\u2019s some sort of communal sleeping bag?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a sleeping bag,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cWould you care to enlighten me?\u201d Ghastek said.</p><p>\u201cLook at it from above.\u201d</p><p>The purple vampire leaped onto the nearest tree and scurried up into the branches. A long moment passed and then it dropped on the ground next to me without a word.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Tracy asked.</p><p>The vampire\u2019s face was unreadable, like a blank wall. \u201cIt\u2019s a glove.\u201d</p><p>The wind stirred the tree branches. The world blinked, as the tech vanished, crushed under the onslaught of a magic wave. Cold froze the glade. The other vampire burst from the bushes and came to rest by Tracy.</p><p>In the distance something wailed in an inhuman voice, its forlorn cry rising high above the treetops.</p><p>Gloom claimed the clearing. It came slowly, like molasses, from the dark spaces deep between the roots, washing over trees, leaching color from the greenery, drenching it in shadows, until the shrubs and foliage turned dark, almost gray. Behind the gloom, mist rose in thin wisps, tinted with an eerie bluish glow.</p><p>A crow cried overhead, its shrill caw impossibly distant.</p><p>\u201cThey are putting on quite a show,\u201d Ghastek said.</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d I nodded. \u201cGoing all out. Viking special effects are out of this world.\u201d</p><p>I pulled a canvas bundle out of my backpack and untied the cord securing it. Four sharpened sticks lay inside, each three feet long. I picked up a rock and hammered the first of the sticks into the ground at the mouth of the path. That was the way I\u2019d run when it came time to get the hell out of there.</p><p>I moved along the edge of the clearing, sinking the sticks in at regular intervals.</p><p>\u201cWhat is the purpose of this?\u201d Ghastek asked.</p><p>\u201cProtection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave I given you a reason to doubt my competence, Kate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I pulled a black box out of my backpack, took a black cloth out of it, and unfolded the cloth to extract an old pipe. The medicine woman had already packed it with tobacco.</p><p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA pipe.\u201d I struck a match, puffed to get the pipe going, and got a mouthful of smoke for my trouble. The pungent tobacco scraped the inside of my throat. I coughed and started to circle the clearing, blowing smoke as I went.</p><p>\u201cWhat sort of magic is this?\u201d one of the journeymen asked.</p><p>\u201cCherokee. Very old.\u201d If life was perfect, I\u2019d have Immokalee herself do the ritual. It took years of training for the medicine woman to reach her power, but none of the Cherokees would go near the draugr. Unlike me, they had common sense. All the chants over the sticks and the pipe had been said already. All I had to do was follow the ritual and hope Immokalee\u2019s magic was potent enough to work when an incompetent like me activated it.</p><p>I finished the circle, put the pipe away, and sat back on the log.</p><p>A pair of tiny eyes ignited by the roots of an oak to the left. No iris was visible\u2014the entire eye was an almond-shaped slit of pale yellow glow.</p><p>\u201cLeft,\u201d Tracy said. Her voice was perfectly calm.</p><p>\u201cI see it,\u201d Ghastek said.</p><p>Another pair sparked to the right, about a foot off the ground. Then another, and another. All around us the eyes fluoresced, clustered around tree trunks, staring from the underbrush, peering from behind rocks.</p><p>\u201cWhat are they?\u201d Tracy asked.</p><p>\u201cUldra,\u201d Ghastek said. \u201cThey\u2019re nature spirits from Lapland. They live mostly underground. I wouldn\u2019t provoke them. Stay in the clearing.\u201d</p><p>The eyes stared at us, unblinking.</p><p>A blast of icy cold ripped through the clearing. The uldra vanished as one. On the ground, the deer moaned, coming up out of its drugged state.</p><p>Here we go.</p><p>I reached into my backpack and pulled out a small leather satchel, a small plastic bear full of honey, and a canteen. No turning back now. I got up off the log and walked over to the center of the glade where a large stone waited. Ghastek\u2019s and Tracy\u2019s vampires trailed me.</p><p>I brushed the leaves from the stone. The inside of the rock had been hollowed out into a stone basin, large enough to hold about three gallons of liquid.</p><p>\u201cWhen the draugr appears, don\u2019t talk to him,\u201d I said. \u201cThe longer we talk, the more time he has to lock onto our scent. We\u2019ll have to fight to get clear anyway. No need to make things harder.\u201d</p><p>No response.</p><p>\u201cGhastek? Do you understand me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThe Cherokee have set protective wards on the mountain. If we make it to the pillars by the road, we\u2019re safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said this before,\u201d Ghastek informed me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just reminding you.\u201d This wouldn\u2019t go well.</p><p>I set the canteen on the ground and loosened the drawstring cord securing the pouch. It opened into a square of leather in the palm of my hand. Inside lay six rune stones chiseled from bone, and a handful of beat-up silver coins: two etched with a sword and hammer and four with the Viking raven. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I cast the runes into the basin. They clicked, rolling from the stone sides. It took me a second to unscrew the canteen. Ale splashed on the runes, drenching the bone in liquid amber. The scent of malted barley and juniper wafted up. The bluish mist snapped at it like a striking snake.</p><p>\u201cPatience, H\u00e5kon. Patience.\u201d</p><p>I poured in the rest of the ale, emptied the honey into the basin, and stirred it with a branch. Magic spread from the runes into the honey and ale. I reached in and pulled the runes out, all except two: the rune of enemy binding and \u00dej\u00f3fastafur, the rune that prevented theft.</p> <p>The mist hovered by me.</p><p>I took a deep breath, grabbed the deer by the head, and heaved it onto the basin. Moist brown eyes looked at me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>I pulled a throwing knife out and slit the animal\u2019s throat in a single quick swipe. Blood gushed into the basin, hot and red. The deer thrashed, but I held its head until the blood flow stopped. The basin was a third of the way full. I stepped back and hefted the coins in my hand. They jingled together, sparking with magic.</p><p>\u201cI call you out, H\u00e5kon. Come from your grave. Come taste the blood ale.\u201d</p> <p>Magic pulsed through the glade, ice cold and shockingly powerful. It pierced my skin, ripping its way all the way into my bones. I recoiled. Panic crested inside me like a huge black wave. Every instinct I had screamed, \u201cRun! Run as fast as you can.\u201d</p><p>I clenched my teeth.</p><p>The air reeked of fetid, decaying flesh. It left a sickeningly sweet patina on my tongue.</p><p>The mist congealed with an eerie moan and a creature stepped forth to the basin. A thick cloak of half-rotten fur hung off his shoulders, shielding the chain mail that covered him from elbow to the knee. The fur had thinned to long feathery strands, smeared with dirt. Long colorless hair spilled from his head in a tangled mess. His skin was blue, as if he had an intense case of argyria.</p><p>The draugr dropped by the basin, dipped his head, and lapped the blood like a dog. Death had sucked all softness from his flesh. His face was a leathery mask of wrinkles, his nose was a misshapen nub, and his lips had dried to nothing, baring a mouth full of long vampiric teeth. His eyes were awful: pale green, and completely solid, as if made of frosted glass. No iris, no pupil, nothing. Just two dead eyes behind an opaque green membrane.</p><p>I gave him a couple of seconds with the blood and squeezed the runes. They warmed my skin, forging a link to the two left in the blood ale. \u201cThat\u2019s plenty.\u201d</p> <p>The undead raised his head. Blood dripped from his chin. A voice came, hoarse, like the creaking of trees in the wood. \u201cWho are you, meat?\u201d</p><p>Not good. \u201cI\u2019ve come to trade. Fair trade: fresh meat for an answer.\u201d</p><p>The draugr dipped its head toward the blood. Magic pulsed from the runes. The creature let out a long sound halfway between a sigh and a growl.</p><p>Ghastek\u2019s vampire moved to stand next to me.</p><p>The undead swiveled to the bloodsucker. \u201cYou bring me dead meat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Dead meat guards me. Dead meat has no power over the ale. If you want to talk to dead meat, that\u2019s between you and it.\u201d</p><p>The draugr rose above the basin, shoulders hunched over. \u201cDead meat speaks?\u201d</p><p>Ghastek shifted the vampire another step.</p> <p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t,\u201d I told him.</p><p>The vamp halted. \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>Would it kill him not to screw with my thing?</p><p>The draugr leaned on the stone. \u201cI\u2019m H\u00e5kon, son of Eivind. My father was a jarl and his father before him was one. The blood ale calls to me. Who are you, meat, that you interrupt my feeding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Ghastek Sedlak, Master of the Dead.\u201d</p><p>The draugr\u2019s mouth gaped wider. The creature rocked back and forth. \u201cDr\u00f3ttinn of the dead. I am dead. Do you style yourself my master too, little dead meat?\u201d</p><p>Full stop. \u201cDon\u2019t answer that. Your ale is getting cold, H\u00e5kon. Have a taste.\u201d</p><p>The runes in my hand cooled. The undead took a step toward me, then turned, as if drawn by a magnet, dropped on his knees and drank deeply, sucking up the blood in long greedy swallows.</p><p>\u201cHow did you come to be here?\u201d Ghastek asked.</p><p>Damn it all to hell.</p><p>The draugr turned its unblinking eyes to the vampire and raised his head from the blood for a moment. \u201cWe came for gold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll the way from Norseland?\u201d</p><p>The draugr shook its head and drank.</p><p>\u201cKate,\u201d Ghastek said. \u201cMake him talk. Please.\u201d</p><p>How do I get myself into these things? I gripped the runes. The draugr ducked down, trying to lick the blood, got within two inches of the red surface and stopped.</p><p>\u201cFrom Vinland. The north skr\u00e6lingar brought us gold to trade for weapons. They told us they bartered with the southern tribes for it. They said the southern skr\u00e6lingar were soft. They were farmers, they said. Our seers had scryed the source of the gold, in the hills, not far from the coast. We took two ships and went looking for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you find the gold?\u201d Ghastek asked.</p><p>The draugr reared back, his teeth on display. \u201cWe found woods, and giant birds, and skr\u00e6lingar magic. We were retreating when a skr\u00e6ling arrow found me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why you rose? To punish the native tribe?\u201d Ghastek asked.</p><p>He just wouldn\u2019t stop talking.</p><p>The draugr\u2019s clawed hands scratched the stone of the basin. Magic snapped from him, flaring like a foul banner. The hair on the back of my neck rose.</p><p>\u201cTo punish them? No. I rose to punish the ingrate dogs who threw me into a hole in the ground like a common thrall. Not one of them bothered to even place a stone to mark my grave. I killed some of them and ate their flesh, but a few still lived. I\u2019ve searched for them, but I can\u2019t find them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t find them, because they\u2019ve been dead for a thousand years,\u201d I told him. Damn it. Now Ghastek had me doing it.</p><p>The wrinkled mask of the draugr\u2019s face twisted in derision. \u201cSo you say.\u201d</p><p>Ghastek\u2019s vamp leaned forward. \u201cIf you\u2019re so powerful, why don\u2019t you just leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t. The Cherokee wards are locking him in. No more questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn that case\u2014\u201d</p><p>I brought my fist down on the vamp\u2019s bald head. God, that felt good.</p><p>The vamp whipped around, glaring at me in outrage.</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d I told him and turned to the draugr. \u201cBlood ale, undead. If you want any more, you will grant me my boon.\u201d</p><p>The draugr rose, slowly. His fur mantle closed about him. Cold spread from him. My breath turned into a wisp of vapor.</p><p>\u201cAsk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do I find Ivar the Dwarf?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe lives in a hidden valley,\u201d the draugr said. \u201cTravel to Highlands and find Cliffside Lake. At the north edge of the lake, you will see a trail leading you to the mountain scarred by lightning. Make the offering of gold, silver, and iron, and the dwarf will permit you to enter.\u201d</p><p>I released the runes and backed away. \u201cThe blood ale is yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s grown cold.\u201d</p><p>I kept backing up.</p><p>Magic accreted around the draugr like a second cloak. \u201cI do not want it. I want my blood hot.\u201d</p><p>Mayday, mayday. \u201cThat\u2019s not the deal we made.\u201d</p><p>I passed the stick guarding the road.</p><p>\u201cI make deals and I break them.\u201d</p><p>The wooden stick between us shivered in the ground.</p><p>\u201cThere is no escape, meat.\u201d</p><p>The cocoon of the draugr\u2019s magic burst with icy fury, snapping at me with dark fingers. The stick shot from the ground and pierced the draugr\u2019s head.</p><p>I ran.</p><p>Behind me a wail of pure fury tore through the forest and Ghastek\u2019s voice barked, \u201cSecure the creature!\u201d</p><p>Magic exploded with mind-numbing intensity. My eyes watered. The breath in my lungs turned into a clump of ice. The path veered right. As I took the turn at a breakneck speed, I saw the draugr, towering over the trees, a mantle of dark magic streaming from his shoulders as he ripped a vampire in half with his colossal hands.</p><p>\u201cI have your scent,\u201d the giant roared. \u201cYou won\u2019t escape!\u201d</p><p>The translucent flood of magic crested the edge of the glade and rolled down, chasing me.</p><p>The forest turned into a blurry smudge of green. I flew, jumping over the roots. Weeds slapped me.</p><p>The harsh stench of rot filled my mouth. Around me the trees groaned, as if pulled upright by an invisible hand. My throat burned.</p><p>I could almost see the road through the shrubs.</p><p>The path turned left and I leaped straight down, praying the old injury to my left knee wouldn\u2019t flare up. The brush snapped under my weight and I tore down the slope, squeezing every last drop of speed out of my body.</p><p>A deep roar shook the ground.</p><p>No way to dodge, no direction to take but down.</p><p>A shadow fell over me. I threw myself forward. I rolled once, twice, catching a glimpse of a colossal clawed hand raking the forest behind me, flipped to my feet, and burst onto the road.</p><p>The pillar loomed to my right. I sprinted to it.</p><p>The air whistled. Something large crashed on the road ahead of me, bounced, and sprung to its feet. Ghastek\u2019s vampire. Deep gashes scoured its flanks, oozing thick undead blood onto the sunblock. It looked like it had gone through a shredder.</p><p>The trees creaked behind me. The draugr had made it onto the road.</p><p>I ran like I\u2019d never run before in my life.</p><p>The vampire froze for a fraction of an instant and galloped to the pillars.</p><p>My feet barely touched the ground. In my head my bad leg snapped like a toothpick.</p><p>The draugr\u2019s magic whipped at me, slashing at my back. I went airborne, rolled, and hit the ground hard. My head swam. I rolled to my feet.</p><p>Taller than the trees, the enormous undead towered above me, his eyes spilling icy green mist. Ragged chain mail hung from his torso. Colossal iron pauldrons guarded his shoulders. Huge chunks of his flesh were missing, and bone glared through the holes.</p><p>Holy shit.</p><p>The draugr raised a foot the size of a car. His magic swirled about him in a stormy cloud. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Curran in his warrior form shot out of the treetop, flying through the air like a gray blur.</p><p>I stood still, presenting a clear target for H\u00e5kon.</p><p>The draugr stomped forward.</p> <p>Curran smashed into the back of the undead\u2019s neck. Bone crunched. The draugr spun, and I saw Curran ripping into the space between the neck vertebrae with his claws. Undead gristle flew.</p><p>The draugr roared, trying to swat at the Beast Lord. His head began to droop.</p><p>Two ribbons of green magic snapped backward from the draugr, aiming for Curran.</p><p>Oh no, you don\u2019t. I opened my mouth and barked a power word.</p><p>\u201cOssanda.\u201d Kneel, you undead sonovabitch.</p> <p>The magic burst from me. It felt like someone had sunk claws into my stomach and tore out the muscle and my innards. The world went black for a tiny moment. I\u2019d sunk a lot of magic into it.</p><p>The horrible creak of bone snapping rolled through the air. The draugr\u2019s bony knees hit the road. The forest quaked.</p><p>I took a running start and sprinted at him.</p><p>The dazed undead raised its huge hands, trying to grab me. I veered left, avoiding the gnarled bone fingers, and scrambled up the giant\u2019s body, climbing the chain mail.</p><p>Above me, Curran snarled.</p><p>The draugr slapped his chest, missing me by a couple of inches.</p> <p>I pulled myself onto his shoulder and ran down the iron plate to his neck. Curran was ripping into the gristle. The undead flesh tore under his claws, and snapped back, regenerating.</p><p>I pulled Slayer and chopped at the gap he\u2019d made. My saber smoked from the contact with undead flesh. The gap widened.</p><p>Curran grasped the edge of the two vertebrae and forced them apart. I cut into the cleft, slicing through the connective tissue.</p><p>Cut. Cut. Cut.</p><p>Cartilage crunched.</p><p>Magic stung me, weaving about me in green strands.</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d Curran growled.</p><p>I stopped my sword in midstrike. Curran jumped into the gap, his clawed feet on the edge of one vertebra, his hands on the other. He strained, pushing them apart. Steel-hard muscle bulged on his frame, shaking with effort.</p> <p>The draugr howled.</p><p>Curran snarled, a vicious, short sound born of strain.</p><p>With a sickening screech, the draugr\u2019s head fell and rolled off his body. The colossal torso toppled. I jumped and landed on the road, my sword in my hand. Curran dropped down next to me.</p><p>We ran. We sprinted to the pillars.</p><p>Behind us an eerie, unnatural noise announced the draugr reassembling himself.</p><p>The green vampire that had fallen on the road picked itself up and chased after us.</p><p>We were almost to the pillars.</p><p>A shadow fell over us.</p><p>Curran spun. His head melted, reshaping into a lion\u2019s head. The Beast Lord roared.</p><p>The sound was like thunder. Deep, primeval, arresting, it froze the marrow in my bones. My instincts screamed and tried to drop me to the ground in a small quivering ball.</p><p>The draugr screeched to a halt.</p><p>We dashed forward.</p><p>The pillars flashed by our sides. I ran to a stop and turned around, my ribs hurting.</p><p>The undead giant strode toward us.</p><p>The pillars flashed with deep amber.</p><p>The draugr smashed into an invisible wall. Streaks of orange lightning clutched at his flesh. A deafening wail slapped my ears.</p><p>\u201cI will kill you! I will gnaw the flesh off your bones! I will pick my teeth with your femurs!\u201d</p><p>I vomited onto the ground.</p><p>Next to me Curran patted my back, his breath coming in ragged gasps.</p><p>The vampire next to me collapsed. The gashes on its body knitted together. A new pale skin slid over the cuts and began to smoke.</p><p>\u201cYou owe me vampire blood,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cYes, yes.\u201d Ghastek sounded sour. \u201cDo hand me that canvas before he burns to death.\u201d</p><p>I jerked the canvas off the cart and held it up. \u201cI just want to hear you say it.\u201d</p><p>The vamp squirmed.</p><p>I shook the canvas a bit.</p><p>\u201cFine. The draugar do exist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I was right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were right. The canvas, Kate.\u201d</p><p>I draped it over the vampire and looked at Curran. \u201cDid you hear that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard that.\u201d Together we picked up the vampire and heaved the bloodsucker into the cart. \u201cI still don\u2019t believe it, but I heard it.\u201d</p><p>Two vampires dashed past the raging draugr, one purple, one orange. The remains of Ghastek\u2019s super-squad.</p><p>\u201cOver here,\u201d I waved. \u201cRun to safety!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould the two of you gloat a little more?\u201d Ghastek said.</p><p>\u201cOh I could,\u201d I said. \u201cI definitely could.\u201d</p><p>The vampire pulled the canvas back and peeked out, staring in the direction of the glade. \u201cDouble or nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDouble or nothing, Kate. I can take him.\u201d</p><p>Ghastek was a gambler. Knock me over with a feather. I sat on the cart. The draugr would rip them to pieces in ten minutes, tops.</p><p>\u201cKnock yourself out,\u201d Curran told him. \u201cWe\u2019ll wait right here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t take too long,\u201d I told him. \u201cWe have a child to save.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 10</p><p>I knew that something was wrong by the look on the face of the werewolf who opened the door to the Pack\u2019s safe house. The Pack owned several properties in the city, and after we were done clapping and cheering at the sight of Ghastek\u2019s complete and utter failure, Curran and I had made a beeline for the nearest one to wash the undead nastiness off. The magic had fallen and with technology once again reasserting its grip on the world, Curran was eager to trade the cart for a Pack Jeep.</p><p>When the male werewolf opened the door, his eyes had that particular look to them that meant some catastrophe had happened.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Curran growled.</p><p>The werewolf licked his lips.</p><p>\u201cOut with it,\u201d Curran said.</p><p>\u201cAndrea Nash has been seen in the city, interviewing business owners.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is frequently in the city,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd interviewing is her job. She\u2019s investigating some murders for the Pack.\u201d Which I would look into as soon as we got Roderick out of that damned necklace.</p><p>The werewolf took a small step back. \u201cShe\u2019s doing it in her beastkin shape.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s walking around in her beastkin shape. And some clothes.\u201d</p><p>All unaffiliated shapeshifters within the Pack\u2019s borders were required to present themselves to the Pack within three days. Until now, the Pack had been able to deny all knowledge that Andrea was a shapeshifter, mostly because Curran made a very public point of ignoring it and nobody cared to bring it up.</p><p>Well, he couldn\u2019t ignore it any longer. Andrea had pretty much made sure of that.</p><p>It made no sense. Andrea almost never used her beastkin shape. In fact, she pretended to be human most of the time. Going out in her fur and claws for her would be equivalent to me taking off my clothes and parading through the city naked.</p><p>Something had happened. Something really bad.</p><p>I looked at Curran. \u201cI guess we\u2019d better go back to the office.\u201d</p><p>I walked through the office doors carrying a vampire\u2019s head smeared in green sunblock. I had picked it up after the draugr had punted it out of the ward zone. It was beginning to smell and needed to be buried in ice ASAP.</p><p>Andrea sat at her desk. She was wearing her beastkin shape, a perfect meld of human and hyena. It was a shape that could get her killed. Andrea\u2019s father was a hyenawere, an animal who turned into a human. That made her beastkin, and many older shapeshifters would want to murder her on sight.</p><p>\u201cWant\u201d being the operative word. Andrea could take care of herself. On top of that, I would help her, and Curran had made it plain that this was a prejudice he would not tolerate. He was waiting outside now in a parking lot a block away. I had asked him to give us a few minutes.</p><p>Andrea\u2019s feet were on the table. Her T-shirt was torn, her pants were in tatters, and a mess of blood and tissue stained both. She wiggled her clawed toes at me.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d Andrea raised her hand. There was a bottle in it. She was drinking.</p><p>I went into the kitchen, got a ceramic dish from under the sink, and deposited my vampire head inside the fridge. Then I came back, shrugged out of my sword sheath, and sat in the chair.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you drinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGeorgia Peach Iced Tea. Want some?\u201d Andrea shook the bottle at me.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d I sipped it. FIRE. \u201cWhat the hell is in this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVodka, gin, rum, sweet and sour, and peach schnapps. Lots of peach schnapps.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d never seen her drink before. \u201cDo you actually get a buzz from this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSort of. It lasts for about thirty seconds or so and then I need another gulp.\u201d</p><p>I tried to think. Derek was back at the Keep, but I was pretty sure Ascanio should have reported to the office this morning. \u201cWhere is the bane of my existence?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the shower, freshening up.\u201d</p><p>Damn it all to hell. \u201cOh God, who did Ascanio screw now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, he\u2019s covered in blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh good.\u201d Wait a minute. \u201cThe kid is covered in blood and we\u2019re relieved. There is something wrong with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about it.\u201d Andrea eyed me. \u201cNot going to mention my beastkin appearance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like it. The torn pants and gore-stained T-shirt is a nice touch.\u201d</p><p>She pointed her foot at me. \u201cI was thinking of painting my claws a nice shade of pink.\u201d</p><p>Those claws were three inches long. \u201cThat would take a lot of nail polish. What about some golden hoops in your ears instead?\u201d</p><p>Andrea grinned, baring a row of sharp fangs. \u201cIt\u2019s a definite possibility.\u201d</p><p>Okay, you know what, screw this. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw Raphael this morning. I\u2019d called him last night, because Jim put me on some shapeshifter murders and I needed to interview him. I wanted a chance to apologize.\u201d</p><p>Raphael, you spoiled moron, what the hell did you do?</p><p>I took her bottle and drank from it. I needed some alcohol for the next part. It tasted vile. I swallowed it down anyway. \u201cHow did it go?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe replaced me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe found another girl. She is seven feet tall, with breasts the size of honeydew melons, legs that start at her neck, bleached blond hair down to her ass, and her waist is this big around.\u201d She touched her claws together. \u201cThey are engaged to be engaged.\u201d</p> <p>Of all the stupid, idiotic things...\u201cHe brought her here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe sat in that chair right there.\u201d She pointed at a chair. \u201cI\u2019m thinking of burning it.\u201d</p><p>Andrea loved Raphael the way birds loved the sky, and until a minute ago I would\u2019ve sworn that he would have run into fire for her. \u201cDid you punch him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d Andrea shook her head. \u201cAfter he told me that his new sweetheart\u2019s best quality is that she isn\u2019t me, it didn\u2019t seem like it would make any difference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she a shapeshifter?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA human. Not a fighter. Not that bright either.\u201d The false cheer evaporated from her voice. \u201cI know what you\u2019ll say\u2014it\u2019s my own fault.\u201d</p><p>I wish I knew the right words to say. \u201cWell, you did check out of his life. You checked out of my life for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah.\u201d Andrea looked away.</p><p>Raphael was spoiled. He was handsome, and treasured by both his mother and Clan Bouda in general, but he was never known for being mean or cruel. He was also the male alpha of Clan Bouda. He had to have known exactly what sort of risks he faced by bringing another woman and shoving her at Andrea. He had to have done it to provoke a reaction. The next time we met I\u2019d pound his face into ground beef.</p><p>Still...I couldn\u2019t believe that there was no method to his madness. He\u2019d chased Andrea for months and he\u2019d won her, then lost her. Perhaps this was some sort of stupid attempt to make her chase him.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to fight for him?\u201d</p> <p>Andrea stared at me like I was crazy. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to fight for him, or are you going to roll over on your back and take it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook who\u2019s talking. How long did it take you and Curran to have a conversation after that whole dinner mess? Was it three weeks or more like a month?\u201d</p><p>I arched my eyebrow at her. \u201cThat\u2019s different. That was a misunderstanding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAha.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe brought his new main squeeze here after you called him with a peace offering. That\u2019s a slap in the face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to tell me that. I know.\u201d Andrea growled.</p><p>\u201cSo what are you going to do about it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI haven\u2019t decided yet.\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure she felt Raphael was worth fighting for. But once, when I was in a really bad place, Andrea had told me that she felt like being with Raphael had healed her. She\u2019d said he was picking up broken pieces of her and putting them back together. Well, all the pieces had fallen again, and Andrea was trying to reassemble herself on her own.</p><p>I\u2019d seen Andrea fight. I\u2019d seen her in unguarded moments, taken over by bloodlust and rage. Raphael would have to tread very carefully, because whether she decided that she wanted him or revenge, nothing would stop her.</p><p>I tried to pick my words carefully. \u201cNothing is free. If you want it, you have to fight for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking about it,\u201d she said. \u201cHow did your day go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got some head. It was vamp, but still.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat good, huh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a glass monster corpse for you. It\u2019s in the freezer.\u201d</p><p>I gave her a nice smile. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a bribe for putting up with my psychotic break.\u201d</p><p>The car motor started up. Curran had gotten tired of waiting.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my ride,\u201d I said.</p><p>The door swung open, and Curran walked in. I held my breath. Having Andrea and him at each other\u2019s throats would be more than I could take.</p><p>Andrea rose to her feet.</p><p>A show of respect for the Beast Lord. I decided that breathing was a good thing.</p><p>Curran nodded to Andrea. I got up too, walked over to him, and kissed him, just in case he was entertaining any violent thoughts. He winked at me.</p><p>\u201cHold on, let me grab the vamp head.\u201d I went to the back and got my head.</p><p>When I came out, carrying the head in a plastic bag, Andrea and Curran were still in one piece and had been joined by a freshly washed Ascanio.</p><p>I waved at Andrea, and Curran and I went to the car. Ascanio tried to linger behind, but Curran looked at him, and the kid decided he\u2019d better follow us.</p><p>We got into the car and pulled away.</p><p>\u201cAnd how did your day go?\u201d I asked Ascanio.</p><p>He turned to me, a dreamy look on his pretty face. \u201cWe killed things. There was blood. Fountains of blood. And then we had barbecue.\u201d</p><p>Why me?</p><p>When we walked through the doors of the Keep, Doolittle was waiting for us. Roderick\u2019s necklace had turned the color of white gold. He was having trouble breathing. The next magic wave could be his last.</p><p>Ten minutes later we rode out of the Keep in a Pack vehicle. Curran drove. I sat in the passenger seat, holding a bowl of jewelry and bullets for our offering. Doolittle and the boy sat in the back. Roderick whistled with every breath, and Curran drove like a maniac to the north leyline, his hands locked on the wheel, his face a grim mask. We reached the leypoint in record time and he didn\u2019t slow down as he drove the Jeep off the ramp into the invisible magic current. The magic clutched the car and dragged it north to the mountains. Whether magic or technology was in ascendance, the leylines always flowed and I was damn grateful for their existence.</p><p>The current carried us to Franklin, spitting us out at a remote leypoint, and from there we drove up a winding road to the Highlands. It used to be a ritzy destination, beautiful lakes and waterfalls wrapped in emerald-green forests that spilled from the sheer cliffs. Million-dollar homes, leisure boats, play ranches with pampered horses...But the magic had wrecked the infrastructure and the residents quickly learned that the mountains in winter are much less fun without electricity and takeout. Now the homes lay abandoned or taken over by die-hard locals. Little villages sprang up here and there, small remote communities whose residents peered suspiciously at us as we drove by.</p><p>Cliffside Lake was beautiful, but we had no time for sightseeing. Eight hours after we had left the Keep, we stood by a mountain scoured with white lightning whip marks.</p><p>I had expected an altar, or some sort of mark to show the right spot, but there was nothing. Just a cliff.</p><p>I dumped a bowl full of jewelry and bullets onto the rocks. They scattered, clinking. \u201cIvar?\u201d</p><p>Nothing happened.</p><p>Doolittle\u2019s face fell.</p><p>\u201cIvar, let us in!\u201d</p><p>The mountains were silent. Only Roderick\u2019s hoarse breathing broke the quiet.</p><p>We should\u2019ve gotten here sooner. Maybe the offering worked only during a magic wave, but as soon as magic hit, the necklace would snap Roderick\u2019s neck.</p><p>\u201cLet us in!\u201d I yelled.</p><p>No answer.</p><p>\u201cLet us in, you fucking sonovabitch.\u201d I hit the mountain with the bowl. \u201cLet us in!\u201d</p><p>\u201cKate,\u201d Curran said softly. \u201cWe\u2019re out of time, baby.\u201d</p><p>Doolittle sat down on a rock and smiled at Roderick, that patient calming smile. \u201cCome sit with me.\u201d</p><p>The boy walked over and scooted onto the rock.</p><p>I sagged against the mountain wall. It didn\u2019t work. All this and it didn\u2019t work.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s pretty up here,\u201d Roderick said.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t fair. He was only a boy...I buried my face in Curran\u2019s shoulder. He wrapped his arms around me.</p><p>\u201cCan you hear the birds?\u201d Doolittle asked.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Roderick said.</p><p>\u201cVery peaceful,\u201d Doolittle said.</p><p>I felt Curran tense and looked up.</p><p>A man walked up the path. Broad and muscular, built like he wrestled bears for a living, he had a wide face, lined with wrinkles and framed with a short dark beard and long brown hair. He wore a pair of soot-stained jeans and a tunic.</p><p>His gaze fell on Roderick and the necklace. Thick hairy eyebrows crept up above his pale blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you guys doing up here?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re looking for Ivar,\u201d Curran said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take you.\u201d The man looked at Roderick and held out his hand. \u201cCome, little one.\u201d</p><p>Roderick hopped off the rock and walked over. The dark-haired man took his hand. Together they walked up the steep mountain path. We followed.</p><p>The path turned behind the cliff, and I saw a narrow gap in the mountain, its walls completely sheer, as if someone had sliced through the rock with a colossal sword. We walked into it, stepping over gravel and rocks.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you folks from?\u201d the man asked.</p><p>\u201cAtlanta,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cBig city,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d None of us mentioned the necklace choking the boy\u2019s throat.</p><p>Ahead the sun shone through the gap. A moment and we passed through and stepped into the light. A valley lay in front of us, the ground gently sloping to the waters of a narrow lake. A watermill turned and creaked on the far shore. To the right a two-story house sat on the lawn of green grass. A few dozen yards to the side a smithy rose and behind it a garden stretched up the slope, enclosed by a chain-link fence. Further still, pale horses ran in a pasture.</p><p>The necklace clicked and fell off Roderick\u2019s neck. The dark-haired man caught it and snapped it in half. \u201cI\u2019ll take that, then.\u201d</p><p>Roderick drew a breath. Tiny red dots swelled on his neck, where the necklace had punctured skin.</p><p>\u201cNo worries,\u201d the man said. \u201cIt will heal in the next magic wave.\u201d</p><p>A shaggy gray dog trotted up to us, spat a tennis ball out of his mouth, and pondered Roderick with big eyes.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Ruckus,\u201d the man said. \u201cHe\u2019d like it if you threw the ball for him.\u201d</p><p>Roderick picked up the tennis ball, looked at it for a moment, and then tossed it down the slope. The dog took off after it. The boy turned to us. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGo ahead,\u201d Doolittle told him.</p><p>Roderick dashed down the slope.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re Ivar,\u201d I said.</p> <p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>It finally sank in. The necklace was gone. Roderick was safe. My legs gave a little bit and I leaned against the nearest tree.</p><p>Ivar studied me. \u201cOh now, that\u2019s not good. Why don\u2019t y\u2019all come down to the house? Trisha was making iced tea before I left. It should be about done.\u201d</p><p>As if in a dream I followed him down to the house. We sat on a covered porch, and Ivar brought a pitcher of tea and some glasses.</p><p>\u201cWhy make a necklace that would strangle a child?\u201d Curran asked.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a long story.\u201d Ivar sighed. \u201cI take it you know what I am?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA dvergr,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Ivar looked at his hands. They were large, out of proportion to his body. \u201cI work with metal. As long as I can remember, the metal spoke to me. Some things I make are harmless. Plows, horseshoes, nails. Some are not. I have made a blade or two in my time. The thing is, once the blade is out of your hands, you can\u2019t control what it\u2019s used for. I try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike with Dagfinn?\u201d I guessed.</p><p>Ivar nodded. \u201cHow is that boy doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Curran said.</p> <p>\u201cGood to hear. He had a bit of a temper, that one.\u201d Ivar looked out at the river\u2019s shore where Roderick and Ruckus chased each other. \u201cTrisha is my second wife. My first one, Lisa, well, she was...The best I can figure, she was elfin. No way to know for sure, of course. She showed up on my doorstep one day and stayed. She was beautiful. We had a daughter, but the valley life wasn\u2019t for Lisa, so one morning I woke up and she was gone. Left the baby with me. I did my best to raise her. She had hair like gold, my Aurellia. But I must have done a lousy job raising her. There was never any warmth in her, no empathy. I don\u2019t know why. She was fully grown when a young man came down to the valley. He said he wanted to apprentice himself to me. To learn about smithing. I don\u2019t take apprentices, but the boy had talent, so he and I made a bargain. He would stay with me for a decade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTen years is a long time,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s enough to learn how not to do harm,\u201d Doolittle said.</p><p>Ivar threw him a grateful look. \u201cYou understand. You can\u2019t teach the craft in ten years. I\u2019m past eighty and I still learn new things every day. But I thought a decade would be long enough to teach him what you should make and what you shouldn\u2019t and when. Can\u2019t just hand that kind of power to a man and let him loose in the world without guidance. So Colin and I made a bargain. He would wear the collar and stay here in the valley to learn all I could teach him. If he left the boundary of the valley before the time was up, the collar would kill him. He understood that there was no turning back. Once he put on the collar, he had to stay here for ten years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAurellia decided to leave?\u201d Curran asked.</p><p>Ivar nodded. \u201cShe had no skills. There\u2019s a school down in Cashiers, and I tried to take her there, but she quit. Didn\u2019t care for it. Didn\u2019t care for the metalwork either. Thought it coarse and common. It\u2019s my own fault: I had explained money to her and that in the outside world you can\u2019t just live off the land and barter the way we do here. So she decided Colin would take care of her. One day I went up in the mountains to the old Cooper mine, and when I came down, they were gone. I had warned Colin that even if he managed to take the collar off, it would try to find him again and he wouldn\u2019t be able to resist. The way I figure, Aurellia got it off him somehow and they must\u2019ve sold it. There was a lot of gold in that collar.\u201d</p><p>Now things made sense. Colin made the money. She needed him alive to take care of her. Roderick was just incidental.</p><p>\u201cColin doesn\u2019t do metal smithing anymore,\u201d I told him. \u201cHe\u2019s an accountant. I don\u2019t think he even remembers his time here. They way he acted when he saw the collar, I don\u2019t think he knew what it was. He and Aurellia had a daughter. The necklace killed her. That\u2019s their son.\u201d I pointed down toward the valley where the boy and dog played. \u201cAurellia put the necklace on him to keep it off Colin.\u201d</p> <p>Ivar\u2019s face jerked. \u201cThe necklace was never meant to follow the blood. It was only meant to keep Colin here.\u201d</p><p>Roderick came up the stairs. His face was flushed. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to go yet, do we?\u201d</p><p>I would not take him back to that bitch.</p><p>Ivar looked at his grandson. There was a sadness there and regret. A lot of regret. I could see the resemblance between them now: same dark hair, same serious, somber look in the eyes.</p><p>\u201cDo you like it here?\u201d Doolittle asked.</p><p>Roderick nodded.</p><p>The medmage looked at the dwarf. \u201cSecond chances don\u2019t come about often.\u201d</p><p>Ivar\u2019s face went slack.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s right,\u201d Curran said.</p><p>Ivar took a deep breath and smiled at Roderick. \u201cRoderick, I\u2019m your grandfather. Would you like to stay here for a while? With me?\u201d</p><p>Roderick looked at Doolittle.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your choice,\u201d the medmage said. \u201cYou can come back with me, if you would like.\u201d</p><p>Roderick mulled it over.</p><p>\u201cI never had a grandfather before,\u201d the boy said.</p><p>\u201cI never had a grandson before,\u201d Ivar answered.</p><p>\u201cCan I go swimming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Ivar said. \u201cYour grandmother will be back from the market soon. We\u2019ll have us some lunch and you can go swimming. The water\u2019s cold but you might enjoy it. Our kind does.\u201d</p><p>Roderick smiled. It was a tiny hesitant smile. \u201cI would like that.\u201d</p><p>Ivar got up and offered the boy his hand. \u201cWould you like to see my smithy?\u201d</p><p>Roderick nodded. The two of them walked off the porch together, hand in hand.</p><p>The three of us sat on the porch, watched the river, and drank the iced tea.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Aurellia?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s still married to the DA\u2019s brother-in-law,\u201d Curran said. \u201cA woman told me it would be a bad idea to do anything about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t worry about Aurellia,\u201d Doolittle said, watching Ivar and Roderick by the smithy. \u201cI have a feeling she\u2019ll get what\u2019s coming to her.\u201d</p><p>EPILOGUE</p><p>Atlanta Avery hospital reported an extremely troubling case: a local woman, Aurellia Sunny, has aged forty years overnight. The medmage professionals theorize that accelerated aging occurred due to a gold ring that arrived in the mail and was left on Mrs. Sunny\u2019s front porch. The ring has since dissolved into her skin and is impossible to remove. The aging process is continuing and the family has been advised to make the proper arrangements. PAD Detective Tsoi, the lead investigator on the case, had the following advice for residents: \u201cDon\u2019t accept gifts from anonymous parties. If you don\u2019t know who the package is from, don\u2019t open it.\u201d</p><p>The Atlanta Journal-Constitution </p> </body></html>"]
