Serious insane.</p><p>Normal Mum-insane: Mum says, \u201cLet\u2019s all do this great gluten-free diet I read about in the Daily Mail!\u201d Mum buys three loaves of gluten-free bread. It\u2019s so disgusting our mouths curl up. The family goes on strike and Mum hides her sandwich in the flower bed and next week we\u2019re not gluten free anymore.</p><p>That\u2019s normal Mum-insane. But this is serious insane.</p> <p>She\u2019s standing at her bedroom window, which overlooks Rosewood Close, where we live. No, standing sounds too normal. Mum does not look normal. She\u2019s teetering, leaning over the edge, a wild look in her eye. And she\u2019s holding my brother Frank\u2019s computer. It\u2019s balanced precariously on the window ledge. Any minute, it\u2019ll crash down to the ground. That\u2019s seven hundred pounds\u2019 worth of computer.</p><p>Does she realize this? Seven hundred pounds. She\u2019s always telling us we don\u2019t know the value of money. She\u2019s always saying stuff like \u201cDo you have any idea how hard it is to earn ten pounds?\u201d and \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t waste that electricity if you had to pay for it.\u201d</p><p>Well, how about earning seven hundred pounds and then deliberately smashing it on the ground?</p><p>Below us, on the front lawn, Frank is scampering about in his Big Bang Theory T-shirt, clutching his head and gibbering with panic.</p><p>\u201cMum.\u201d His voice has gone all high-pitched with terror. \u201cMum, that\u2019s my computer!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know it\u2019s your computer!\u201d Mum cries hysterically. \u201cDon\u2019t you think I know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMum, please, can we talk about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve tried talking!\u201d Mum lashes back. \u201cI\u2019ve tried cajoling, arguing, pleading, reasoning, bribing...I\u2019ve tried everything! EVERYTHING, Frank!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I need my computer!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do not need your computer!\u201d Mum yells, so furiously that I flinch.</p><p>\u201cMummy is going to throw the computer!\u201d says Felix, running onto the grass and looking up in disbelieving joy. Felix is our little brother. He\u2019s four. He greets most life events with disbelieving joy. A lorry in the street! Ketchup! An extra-long chip! Mum throwing a computer out of the window is just another one on the list of daily miracles.</p> <p>\u201cYes, and then the computer will break,\u201d says Frank fiercely. \u201cAnd you won\u2019t be able to play Star Wars ever again, ever.\u201d</p><p>Felix\u2019s face crumples in dismay and Mum flinches with fresh anger.</p><p>\u201cFrank!\u201d she yells. \u201cDo not upset your brother!\u201d</p><p>Now our neighbours across the close, the McDuggans, have come out to watch. Their twelve-year-old son, Ollie, actually yells, \u201cNoooo!\u201d when he sees what Mum\u2019s about to do.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Turner!\u201d He hurries across the street to our lawn and gazes up pleadingly, along with Frank.</p><p>Ollie sometimes plays Land of Conquerors online with Frank if Frank\u2019s in a kind mood and doesn\u2019t have anyone else to play with. Now Ollie looks even more freaked out than Frank.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t break the computer, Mrs. Turner,\u201d he says, trembling. \u201cIt has all Frank\u2019s backed-up game commentaries on it. They\u2019re so funny.\u201d He turns to Frank. \u201cThey\u2019re really funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d mutters Frank.</p> <p>\u201cYour mum\u2019s really like...\u201d He blinks nervously. \u201cShe\u2019s like Goddess Warrior Enhanced Level Seven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m what?\u201d demands Mum.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a compliment,\u201d snaps Frank, rolling his eyes. \u201cWhich you\u2019d know if you played. Level Eight,\u201d he corrects Ollie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Ollie hastily agrees. \u201cEight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t even communicate in English!\u201d Mum flips. \u201cReal life is not a series of levels!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMum, please,\u201d Frank chimes in. \u201cI\u2019ll do anything. I\u2019ll stack the dishwasher. I\u2019ll phone Grandma every night. I\u2019ll...\u201d He casts wildly about. \u201cI\u2019ll read to deaf people.\u201d</p><p>Read to deaf people? Can he actually hear what he\u2019s saying?</p><p>\u201cDeaf people?\u201d Mum explodes. \u201cDeaf people? I don\u2019t need you to read to deaf people! You\u2019re the bloody deaf one around here! You never hear anything I say! You always have those wretched earphones in\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnne!\u201d</p><p>I turn to see Dad joining the fray, and a couple of neighbours are stepping out of their front doors. This is officially a Neighbourhood Incident.</p><p>\u201cAnne!\u201d Dad calls again.</p><p>\u201cLet me do this, Chris,\u201d says Mum warningly, and I can see Dad gulp. My dad is tall and handsome in a car advert way, and he looks like the boss, but inside, he isn\u2019t really an alpha male. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>No, that sounds bad. He\u2019s alpha in a lot of ways, I suppose. Only Mum is even more alpha. She\u2019s strong and bossy and pretty and bossy.</p><p>I said bossy twice, didn\u2019t I?</p><p>Well. Draw your own conclusions from that.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re angry, sweetheart,\u201d Dad\u2019s saying soothingly. \u201cBut isn\u2019t this a little extreme?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cExtreme? He\u2019s extreme! He\u2019s addicted, Chris!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not addicted!\u201d Frank yells.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just saying\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Mum finally turns her head to look at Dad properly. \u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you drop it there, you\u2019ll damage the car.\u201d Dad winces. \u201cMaybe shift to the left a little?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t care about the car! This is tough love!\u201d She tilts the computer more precariously on the window ledge and we all gasp, including the watching neighbours.</p><p>\u201cLove?\u201d Frank is shouting up at Mum. \u201cIf you loved me you wouldn\u2019t break my computer!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if you loved me, Frank, you wouldn\u2019t get up at two a.m. behind my back to play online with people in Korea!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got up at two a.m.?\u201d says Ollie to Frank, wide-eyed.</p><p>\u201cPracticing.\u201d Frank shrugs. \u201cI was practicing,\u201d he repeats to Mum with emphasis. \u201cI have a tournament coming up! You\u2019ve always said I should have a goal in life! Well, I have!\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlaying Land of Conquerors is not a goal! Oh God, oh God...\u201d She bangs her head on the computer. \u201cWhere did I go wrong?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, Audrey,\u201d says Ollie suddenly, spotting me. \u201cHi, how are you?\u201d</p><p>I shrink back from my position at my bedroom window in fright. My window is tucked away on a corner, and no-one was meant to notice me. Least of all Ollie, who I\u2019m pretty sure has a tiny crush on me, even though he\u2019s two years younger than me and barely reaches up to my chest.</p><p>\u201cLook, it\u2019s the celebrity!\u201d quips Ollie\u2019s dad, Rob. He\u2019s been calling me \u201cthe celebrity\u201d for the last four weeks, even though Mum and Dad have separately been over to ask him to stop. He thinks it\u2019s funny and that my parents have no sense of humour. (I\u2019ve often noticed that people equate \u201chaving a sense of humour\u201d with \u201cbeing an insensitive moron.\u201d)</p><p>This time, though, I don\u2019t think Mum or Dad has even heard Rob\u2019s oh-so-witty joke. Mum is still moaning \u201cWhere did I go wroooong?\u201d and Dad is peering at her anxiously.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t go wrong!\u201d he calls up. \u201cNothing\u2019s wrong! Darling, come down and have a drink. Put the computer down...for now,\u201d he adds hastily at her expression. \u201cYou can throw it out of the window later.\u201d</p><p>Mum doesn\u2019t move an inch. The computer is rocking still more precariously on the windowsill, and Dad flinches. \u201cSweetheart, I\u2019m just thinking about the car...We\u2019ve only just paid it off...\u201d He moves towards the car and holds out his hands, as though to shield it from plummeting hardware.</p><p>\u201cGet a blanket!\u201d says Ollie, springing to life. \u201cSave the computer! We need a blanket. We\u2019ll form a circle...\u201d</p><p>Mum doesn\u2019t even seem to hear him.</p> <p>\u201cI breast-fed you!\u201d she shrieks at Frank. \u201cI read you Winnie-the-Pooh! All I wanted was a well-rounded son who would be interested in books and art and the outdoors and museums and maybe a competitive sport...\u201d</p><p>\u201cLOC is a competitive sport!\u201d yells Frank. \u201cYou don\u2019t know anything about it! It\u2019s a serious thing! You know, the prize pot in the international LOC competition in Toronto this year is six million dollars!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you keep telling us!\u201d Mum erupts. \u201cSo, what, you\u2019re going to win that, are you? Make your fortune?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d He gives her a dark look. \u201cIf I get enough practice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrank, get real!\u201d Her voice echoes around the close, shrill and almost scary. \u201cYou\u2019re not entering the international LOC competition, you\u2019re not going to win the bloody six-million-dollar prize pot, and you\u2019re not going to make your living from gaming! IT\u2019S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN!\u201d</p><p>A MONTH EARLIER</p><p>It all begins with the Daily Mail. Quite a lot of things in our house begin with the Daily Mail.</p><p>Mum starts twitching in that way she does. We\u2019ve had supper and cleared away and she\u2019s been reading the paper with a glass of wine\u2014\u201cMe time,\u201d she calls it\u2014and she\u2019s paused at an article. I can see the headline over her shoulder:</p><p>THE EIGHT SIGNS YOUR CHILD IS</p><p>ADDICTED TO COMPUTER GAMES </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d I hear her murmur. \u201cOh my God.\u201d Her finger is moving down the list and she\u2019s breathing fast. As I squint over, I catch a subheading:</p><p>7. IRRITABILITY AND MOODINESS.</p><p>Ha. Ha ha.</p><p>That\u2019s my hollow laugh, in case you didn\u2019t get that.</p> <p>I mean, seriously, moodiness? Like, James Dean was a moody teenager in Rebel Without a Cause (I have the poster, best film poster ever, best movie ever, sexiest movie star ever, why, why, why did he have to die?). So James Dean must therefore have been addicted to video games? Oh, wait.</p><p>Exactly.</p><p>But there\u2019s no point saying any of this to my mum, because it\u2019s logical and my mum doesn\u2019t believe in logic, she believes in horoscopes and green tea. Oh, and of course the Daily Mail.</p><p>THE EIGHT SIGNS MY MUM IS ADDICTED TO THE DAILY MAIL:</p><p>1. She reads it every day.</p> <p>2. She believes everything it says.</p><p>3. If you try to take it out of her grasp, she pulls it back sharply and says \u201cLeave it!\u201d like you\u2019re trying to kidnap her precious young.</p><p>4. When it runs a scare story about Vitamin D, she makes us all take our shirts off and \u201csunbathe.\u201d (Freeze-bathe, more like.)</p><p>5. When it runs a scare story about melanoma, she makes us all put on sunscreen.</p><p>6. When it runs a story about \u201cthe face cream that really DOES work,\u201d she orders it that moment. Like, she gets out her iPad then and there.</p><p>7. If she can\u2019t get it on holiday, she gets major withdrawal symptoms. I mean, talk about irritability and moodiness.</p> <p>8. She once tried to give it up for Lent. She lasted half a morning.</p><p>Anyway. There\u2019s nothing I can do about my mum\u2019s tragic dependency except hope that she doesn\u2019t do too much damage to her life. (She\u2019s already done major damage to our living room, after reading an \u201cInteriors\u201d piece about \u201cWhy not hand paint all your furniture?\u201d)</p><p>So then Frank ambles into the kitchen, wearing his black I MOD, THEREFORE I AM T-shirt, his earphones in and his phone in his hand. Mum lowers the Daily Mail and stares at him as though the scales have fallen from her eyes.</p><p>(I\u2019ve never understood that. Scales?</p><p>Anyway. Whatever.)</p><p>\u201cFrank,\u201d she says, \u201chow many hours have you played on your computer games this week?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefine computer games,\u201d Frank says, without looking up from his phone.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Mum looks at me uncertainly, and I shrug. \u201cYou know. Computer games. How many hours? FRANK!\u201d she yells, as he makes no move to respond. \u201cHow many hours? Take those things out of your ears!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d says Frank, taking his earphones out. He blinks at her as though he didn\u2019t hear the question. \u201cIs this important?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes this is important!\u201d Mum spits. \u201cI want you to tell me how many hours you\u2019re spending per week playing computer games. Right now. Add it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d says Frank calmly.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t? What do you mean, you can\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re referring to,\u201d says Frank, with elaborate patience. \u201cDo you mean literally computer games? Or do you mean all screen games, including Xbox and PlayStation? Do you include games on my phone? Define your terms.\u201d</p><p>Frank is such a moron. Couldn\u2019t he see Mum was in one of her pre-rant build-ups?</p><p>\u201cI mean anything that warps your mind!\u201d says Mum, brandishing the Daily Mail. \u201cDo you realize the dangers of these games? Do you realize your brain isn\u2019t developing properly? Your BRAIN, Frank! Your most precious organ.\u201d</p><p>Frank gives a dirty snigger, which I can\u2019t help giggling at. Frank is actually pretty funny.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll ignore that,\u201d says Mum stonily. \u201cIt only goes to prove what I was saying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo it doesn\u2019t,\u201d says Frank, and opens the fridge. He takes out a carton of chocolate milk and drains it, straight from the carton, which is gross.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do that!\u201d I say furiously.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s another carton. Relax.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m putting a limit on your playing, young man.\u201d Mum bats the Daily Mail for emphasis. \u201cI\u2019ve just about had enough of this.\u201d</p><p>Young man. That means she\u2019s going to drag Dad into it. Any time she starts using young man or young woman, sure enough the next day there\u2019s some ghastly family meeting, where Dad tries to back up everything Mum says, even though he can\u2019t follow half of it.</p><p>Anyway, not my problem.</p><p>Until Mum arrives in my bedroom that evening and demands,</p><p>\u201cAudrey, what is Land of Conquerors?\u201d</p><p>I look up from Grazia and survey her. She looks tense. Her cheeks are pink and her right hand is all clenched, as if it\u2019s just come off a computer mouse. She\u2019s been Googling \u201ccomputer game addiction,\u201d I just know she has. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cA game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s a game!\u201d Mum sounds exasperated. \u201cBut why does Frank play it all the time? You don\u2019t play it all the time, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I\u2019ve played LOC, and I really don\u2019t get the obsession. I mean, it\u2019s OK for an hour or two.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s the appeal?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, you know.\u201d I think for a moment. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting. You get rewards. And the heroes are pretty good. Like, the graphics are amazing, and they just released this new warrior team with new capabilities, so...\u201d I shrug.</p><p>Mum looks more bewildered than ever. The trouble is, she doesn\u2019t play games. So it\u2019s kind of impossible to convey to her the difference between LOC 3 and, say, Pac-Man from 1985.</p><p>\u201cThey show it on YouTube,\u201d I say in sudden inspiration. \u201cPeople do commentaries. Hang on.\u201d</p><p>As I\u2019m finding a clip on my iPad, Mum sits down and looks around the room. She\u2019s trying to act casual, but I can sense her beady blue eyes scanning my piles of stuff, looking for...what? Anything. Everything. The truth is, Mum and I haven\u2019t done casual for a while. Everything is loaded.</p><p>With everything that\u2019s happened, that\u2019s one of the saddest things of all. We can\u2019t be normal with each other anymore. The tiniest thing I say, Mum\u2019s all over it, even if she doesn\u2019t realize it. Her brain goes into overdrive. What does it mean? Is Audrey all right? What\u2019s Audrey really saying?</p> <p>I can see her looking closely at a pair of old ripped jeans on my chair, as though they hold some dark significance. Whereas in fact the only significance they hold is: I\u2019ve grown out of them. I\u2019ve shot up about three inches in the last year, which makes me five eight. Quite tall for fourteen. People say I look like Mum, but I\u2019m not as pretty as her. Her eyes are so blue. Like blue diamonds. Mine are wishy-washy\u2014not that they\u2019re particularly visible right now.</p><p>Just so you can visualize me, I\u2019m fairly skinny, fairly nondescript, wearing a black vest-top and skinny jeans. And I wear dark glasses all the time, even in the house. It\u2019s...Well. A thing. My thing, I suppose. Hence the \u201ccelebrity\u201d quips from Rob our neighbour. He saw me in my dark glasses, getting out of the car in the rain, and he was all like, \u201cWhy the shades? Are you Angelina Jolie?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not trying to be cool. There\u2019s a reason.</p><p>Which, of course, now you want to know.</p><p>I assume.</p><p>OK, it\u2019s actually quite private. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m ready to tell you yet. You can think I\u2019m weird if you like. Enough people do.</p> <p>\u201cHere we are.\u201d I find a clip of some LOC battle with \u201cArchy\u201d commentating. \u201cArchy\u201d is a YouTuber from Sweden who makes videos that Frank loves. They consist of \u201cArchy\u201d playing LOC and making funny commentaries on the game, and as I expected, it takes me forever to explain this concept to Mum.</p><p>\u201cBut why would you watch someone else playing?\u201d she keeps saying, baffled. \u201cWhy? Isn\u2019t that a complete waste of time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell. Anyway.\u201d I shrug. \u201cThat\u2019s LOC.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s silence for a moment. Mum is peering at the screen like some professor trying to decipher an ancient Egyptian code. There\u2019s an almighty explosion and she winces.</p><p>\u201cWhy does it always have to be about killing? If I designed a game it would centre on ideas. Politics. Issues. Yes! I mean, why not?\u201d I can tell her brain\u2019s firing up with a new idea. \u201cWhat about a computer game called Discuss? You could keep the competitive element, but score points by debating!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that is why we\u2019re not squillionaires,\u201d I say, as though to a third party.</p><p>I\u2019m about to find another clip, when Felix comes running into the room.</p><p>\u201cCandy Crush!\u201d he says in delight as soon as he spies my iPad, and Mum gasps in horror.</p> <p>\u201cHow does he know about that?\u201d she demands. \u201cTurn it off. I\u2019m not having another addict in the family!\u201d</p><p>Oops. It may possibly have been me who introduced Felix to Candy Crush. Not that he has any idea how to play it properly.</p><p>I close down the iPad and Felix stares at it, crestfallen. \u201cCandy Crush!\u201d he wails. \u201cI want to play Candy Cruuuuush!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s broken, Felix.\u201d I pretend to press the iPad. \u201cSee? Broken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBroken,\u201d affirms Mum.</p><p>Felix looks from us to the iPad. You can sense his mind is working as hard as his four-year-old brain cells will let him.</p><p>\u201cWe must buy a plug,\u201d he suggests, with sudden animation, and grabs the iPad. \u201cWe can buy a plug and fix it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe plug shop\u2019s closed,\u201d says Mum, without missing a beat. \u201cWhat a shame. We\u2019ll do it tomorrow. But guess what? We\u2019re going to have toast and Nutella now!\u201d</p><p>\u201cToast and Nutella!\u201d Felix\u2019s face bursts into joyous beams. As he throws up his arms, Mum grabs the iPad from him and gives it to me. Five seconds later I\u2019ve hidden it behind a cushion on the bed.</p><p>\u201cWhere did the Candy Crush go?\u201d Felix suddenly notices its disappearance and screws up his face to howl.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re taking it to the plug shop, remember?\u201d says Mum at once.</p> <p>\u201cPlug shop.\u201d I nod. \u201cBut hey, you\u2019re going to have toast and Nutella! How many pieces are you going to have?\u201d</p><p>Poor old Felix. He lets Mum lead him out of the room, still looking confused. Totally outmaneuvered. That\u2019s what happens when you\u2019re four. Bet Mum wishes she could pull that trick on Frank.</p><p>So now Mum knows what LOC is. And knowledge is power, according to Kofi Annan. Although, as Leonardo da Vinci said: \u201cWhere there is shouting, there is no true knowledge,\u201d which might apply better to our family. (Please don\u2019t think I\u2019m super-well-read or anything. Mum bought me a book of quotations last month and I flick through it when I\u2019m watching telly.)</p><p>Anyway, \u201cknowledge is power\u201d isn\u2019t really happening here, because Mum has no power over Frank at all. It\u2019s Saturday evening, and he\u2019s been playing LOC ever since lunchtime. He disappeared into the playroom straight after pudding. Then there was a ring at the doorbell and I scuttled out of the way into the den, which is my own private place.</p><p>Now it\u2019s nearly six and I\u2019ve crept into the kitchen for some Oreos, to find Mum striding around, all twitchy. She\u2019s exhaling and looking at the clock and exhaling again.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re all computer addicts!\u201d she says in a sudden burst. \u201cI\u2019ve asked them to turn off about twenty-five times! Why can\u2019t they do it? It\u2019s a simple switch! On, off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe they\u2019re on a level\u2014\u201d I begin.</p><p>\u201cLevels!\u201d Mum cuts me off savagely. \u201cI\u2019m tired of hearing about levels! I\u2019m giving them one more minute. That\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>I take out an Oreo and prise it open. \u201cSo, who\u2019s with Frank?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA friend from school. I haven\u2019t met him before. Linus, I think he\u2019s called...\u201d</p><p>Linus. I remember Linus. He was in that school play, To Kill a Mockingbird, and he played Atticus Finch. Frank was Crowd.</p> <p>Frank goes to Cardinal Nicholls School, which is just up the road from my school, Stokeland Girls\u2019 School, and sometimes the two schools join together for plays and concerts and stuff. Although to be truthful, Stokeland isn\u2019t \u201cmy school\u201d anymore. I haven\u2019t been to school since February, because some stuff happened there. Not great stuff.</p><p>Whatever.</p><p>Anyway. Moving on. After that, I got ill. Now I\u2019m going to change schools and go down a year so I won\u2019t fall behind. The new school is called the Heath Academy and they said it would be sensible to start in September, rather than the summer term when it\u2019s mainly exams. So, till then, I\u2019m at home.</p><p>I mean, I don\u2019t do nothing. They\u2019ve sent me lots of reading suggestions and maths books and French vocab lists. Everyone\u2019s agreed it\u2019s vital I keep up with my schoolwork and \u201cIt will make you feel so much better, Audrey!\u201d (It so doesn\u2019t.) So sometimes I send in a history essay or something and they send it back with some red comments. It\u2019s all a bit random.</p><p>Anyway. The point is, Linus was in the play and he was a really good Atticus Finch. He was noble and heroic and everyone believed him. Like, he has to shoot a rabid dog in one scene and the prop gun didn\u2019t work on our night, but no-one in the audience laughed or even murmured. That\u2019s how good he was.</p><p>He came round to our house once, before a rehearsal. Just for about five minutes, but I still remember it.</p><p>Actually, that\u2019s kind of irrelevant.</p><p>I\u2019m about to remind Mum that Linus played Atticus Finch, when I realize she\u2019s left the kitchen. A moment later I hear her voice:</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve played enough, young man!\u201d</p><p>Young man.</p><p>I dart over to the door and look through the crack. As Frank strides into the hall after Mum, his face is quivering with fury.</p><p>\u201cWe hadn\u2019t reached the end of the level! You can\u2019t just switch off the game! Do you understand what you did, just then, Mum? Do you even know how Land of Conquerors works?\u201d</p><p>He sounds properly irate. He\u2019s stopped right underneath where I am, his black hair falling over his pale forehead, his skinny arms flailing, and his big, bony hands gesticulating furiously. I hope Frank grows into his hands and feet one day. They can\u2019t stay so comically huge, can they? The rest of him has to catch up, surely? He\u2019s fifteen, so he could still grow a foot. Dad\u2019s six foot, but he always says Frank will end up taller than him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d says a voice I recognize.

Thanks for having me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go home!\u201d exclaims Mum, in her best charming-to-visitors voice. \u201cPlease don\u2019t go home, Linus. That\u2019s not what I meant at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if we can\u2019t play games...\u201d Linus sounds flummoxed.</p><p>\u201cAre you saying the only form of socialising you boys understand is playing computer games? Do you know how sad that is?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, what do you suggest we do?\u201d says Frank sulkily.</p><p>\u201cI think you should play badminton. It\u2019s a nice summer\u2019s evening, the garden\u2019s beautiful, and look what I found!\u201d She holds out the ropy old badminton set to Frank. The net is all twisted and I can see that some animal has nibbled at one of the shuttlecocks.</p><p>I want to laugh at Frank\u2019s expression.</p><p>\u201cMum...\u201d He appears almost speechless with horror. \u201cWhere did you even find that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr croquet!\u201d adds Mum brightly. \u201cThat\u2019s a fun game.\u201d</p> <p>Frank doesn\u2019t even answer. He looks so stricken by the idea of croquet, I actually feel quite sorry for him.</p><p>\u201cOr hide-and-seek?\u201d</p><p>I give a snort of laughter and clap my hand over my mouth. I can\u2019t help it. Hide-and-seek.</p><p>\u201cOr Rummikub!\u201d says Mum, sounding desperate. \u201cYou always used to love Rummikub.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like Rummikub,\u201d volunteers Linus, and I feel a tweak of approval. He could have legitimately laid into Frank at this point; walked straight out of the house and put on Facebook that Frank\u2019s house sucks. But he sounds like he wants to please Mum. He sounds like one of those people who look around and think, well, why not make life easier for everyone? (I\u2019m getting this from three words, you understand.)</p><p>\u201cYou want to play Rummikub?\u201d Frank sounds incredulous.</p> <p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d says Linus easily, and a moment later the two of them head off towards the playroom. (Mum and Dad repainted it and called it the Teenage Study when I turned thirteen, but it\u2019s still the playroom.)</p><p>Next moment, Mum is back in the kitchen, pouring herself a glass of wine.</p><p>\u201cThere!\u201d she says. \u201cThey just need a little guidance. A little parental control. I simply opened their minds. They\u2019re not addicted to computers. They just need to be reminded what else is out there.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s not talking to me. She\u2019s talking to the Imaginary Daily Mail Judge, who constantly watches her life and gives it marks out of ten.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think Rummikub is a very good game for two,\u201d I say. \u201cI mean, it would take ages to get rid of all your tiles.\u201d</p><p>I can see Mum\u2019s thoughts snagging on this. I\u2019m sure she has the same image I do: Frank and Linus sitting grimly across from each other at the Rummikub table, hating it and deciding that all board games are rubbish and total pants.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d she says at last. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll go and play with them. Make it more fun.\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t ask me if I want to play too, for which I\u2019m grateful.</p> <p>\u201cWell, have a good time,\u201d I say, and take out the Oreo packet. I scoot through the kitchen into the den, and it\u2019s only as I\u2019m zapping on the telly that I hear Mum\u2019s voice resounding through the house from the playroom.</p><p>\u201cI DIDN\u2019T MEAN ONLINE RUMMIKUB!\u201d</p><p>Our house is like a weather system. It ebbs and flows, flares up and subsides. It has times of radiant blue bliss, days of grey dismalness and thunderstorms that flare up out of nowhere. Right now the storm\u2019s coming my way. Thunder-lightning-thunder-lightning, Frank-Mum-Frank-Mum.</p><p>\u201cWhat difference does it make?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt makes every difference! I told you not to go on those computers anymore!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMum, it\u2019s the same bloody game!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not! I want you off that screen! I want you playing a game with your friend! IN REAL LIFE!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no fun with two players. We might as well play, I don\u2019t know, bloody Snap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know!\u201d Mum is almost shrieking. \u201cThat\u2019s why I was coming to play with you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I didn\u2019t bloody KNOW THAT, DID I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop swearing!

I have pretty sharpened reflexes. Oversensitive. Like the rest of me.</p><p>He\u2019s at the doorway. Atticus Finch shoots through my brain. A lanky, brown-haired teenager with wide cheekbones and floppy hair and one of those smiles like an orange segment. Not that his teeth are orange. But his mouth makes that segment shape when he smiles. Which he\u2019s doing now. None of Frank\u2019s other friends ever smile.</p><p>He comes into the den and instinctively my fists clench in fear. He must have wandered off while Mum and Frank were fighting. But no-one comes in this room. This is my space. Didn\u2019t Frank tell him?</p><p>Didn\u2019t Frank say?</p><p>My chest is starting to rise in panic. Tears have already started to my eyes. My throat feels frozen. I need to escape. I need\u2014I can\u2019t\u2014</p> <p>No-one comes in here. No-one is allowed to come in here.</p><p>I can hear Dr. Sarah\u2019s voice in my head. Random snippets from our sessions.</p><p>Breathe in for four counts, out for seven.</p><p>Your body believes the threat is real, Audrey. But the threat isn\u2019t real.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d he tries again. \u201cI\u2019m Linus. You\u2019re Audrey, right?\u201d</p><p>The threat isn\u2019t real. I try to press the words into my mind, but they\u2019re drowned out by the panic. It\u2019s engulfing. It\u2019s like a nuclear cloud.</p> <p>\u201cDo you always wear those?\u201d He nods at my dark glasses.</p><p>My chest is pumping with terror. Somehow I manage to edge past him.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I gasp, and tear through the kitchen like a hunted fox. Up the stairs. Into my bedroom. Into the furthest corner. Crouched down behind the curtain. My breath is coming like a piston engine and tears are coursing down my face. I need a Clonazepam, but right now I can\u2019t even leave the curtain to get it. I\u2019m clinging to the fabric like it\u2019s the only thing that will save me.</p><p>\u201cAudrey?\u201d Mum\u2019s at the bedroom door, her voice high with alarm. \u201cSweetheart? What happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just...you know.\u201d I swallow. \u201cThat boy came in and I wasn\u2019t expecting it...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d soothes Mum, coming over and stroking my head. \u201cIt\u2019s OK. It\u2019s totally understandable. Do you want to take a...\u201d</p><p>Mum never says the words of medication out loud.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll get it.\u201d</p><p>She heads out to the bathroom and I hear the sound of water running. And all I feel is stupid. Stupid.</p><p>So now you know.</p><p>Well, I suppose you don\u2019t know\u2014you\u2019re guessing. To put you out of your misery, here\u2019s the full diagnosis: Social Anxiety Disorder, General Anxiety Disorder, and Depressive Episodes.</p><p>Episodes. Like depression is a sitcom with a fun punch line each time. Or a TV box set loaded with cliffhangers. The only cliffhanger in my life is \u201cWill I ever get rid of this shit?\u201d and believe me, it gets pretty monotonous.</p><p>At my next session with Dr. Sarah I tell her about Linus and the whole anxiety attack thing, and she listens thoughtfully. Dr. Sarah does everything thoughtfully. She listens thoughtfully, she writes thoughtfully with beautiful loopy writing, and she even taps at her computer thoughtfully.</p><p>Her surname is McVeigh but we call her Dr. Sarah because they brainstormed about it in a big meeting and decided first names were approachable but Dr. gave authority and reassurance, so Dr. First Name was the perfect moniker for the children\u2019s unit.</p><p>(When she said \u201cmoniker\u201d I thought they were all going to be renamed Monica. Seriously, for about ten minutes, till she explained.)</p><p>The children\u2019s unit is at a big private hospital called St. John\u2019s, which Mum and Dad got the insurance for through Dad\u2019s job. (The first question they ask when you arrive is not \u201cHow do you feel?\u201d It\u2019s \u201cDo you have insurance?\u201d) I lived here for six weeks, after Mum and Dad worked out that there was something really wrong with me. The trouble is, depression doesn\u2019t come with handy symptoms like spots and a temperature, so you don\u2019t realize at first. You keep saying \u201cI\u2019m fine\u201d to people when you\u2019re not fine. You think you should be fine. You keep saying to yourself: \u201cWhy aren\u2019t I fine?\u201d</p><p>Anyway. At last Mum and Dad took me to see our GP and I got referred and I came here. I was in a bit of a state. I don\u2019t really remember those first few days very well, to be honest. Now I visit twice a week. I could come more often if I wanted\u2014they keep telling me that. I could make cupcakes. But I\u2019ve made them, like, fifty-five zillion times and it\u2019s always the same recipe. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>After I\u2019ve finished telling Dr. Sarah about the whole hiding-behind-the-curtain thing, she looks for a while at the tick box questionnaire I filled in when I arrived.

Very much.</p><p>Dr. Sarah calls this sheet my \u201csymptoms.\u201d Sometimes I think, Shall I just lie and say everything\u2019s rosy? But the weird thing is, I don\u2019t. I can\u2019t do that to Dr. Sarah.

You\u2019d probably been ill for a while before that without realizing. But the good news is, you\u2019ve come such a long way, Audrey. You\u2019re improving every day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cImproving?\u201d I break off, trying to speak calmly. \u201cI\u2019m supposed to be starting a new school in September. I can\u2019t even talk to people. One new person comes to the house and I freak out. How can I go to school? How can I do anything? What if I\u2019m like this forever?\u201d</p><p>A tear is running down my cheek. Where the hell did that come from? Dr. Sarah hands me a tissue without comment and I scrub at my eyes, lifting up my dark glasses briefly to do so.</p><p>\u201cFirst of all, you will not be like this forever,\u201d says Dr. Sarah. \u201cYour condition is fully treatable. Fully treatable.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s said this to me about a thousand times.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve made marked progress since treatment began,\u201d she continues. \u201cIt\u2019s still only May. I have every confidence you will be ready for school in September. But it will require\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know.\u201d I hunch my arms round my body. \u201cPersistence, practice, and patience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you taken off your dark glasses this week?\u201d asks Dr. Sarah.</p><p>\u201cNot much.\u201d</p><p>By which I mean not at all. She knows this.</p><p>\u201cHave you made eye contact with anybody?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t answer. I was supposed to be trying. With a family member. Just a few seconds every day.</p><p>I didn\u2019t even tell Mum. She would have made it into this huge palaver.</p><p>\u201cAudrey?</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d I mutter, my head down.</p><p>Eye contact is a big deal. It\u2019s the biggest deal. Just the thought makes me feel sick, right down to my core.</p><p>I know in my rational head that eyes are not frightening. They\u2019re tiny little harmless blobs of jelly. They\u2019re, like, a minuscule fraction of our whole body area. We all have them. So why should they bother me? But I\u2019ve had a lot of time to think about this, and if you ask me, most people underestimate eyes. For a start, they\u2019re powerful. They have range. You focus on someone a hundred feet away, through a whole bunch of people, and they know you\u2019re looking at them. What other bit of human anatomy can do that? It\u2019s practically being psychic, is what it is.</p><p>But they\u2019re like vortexes too. They\u2019re infinite. You look someone straight in the eye and your whole soul can be sucked out in a nanosecond. That\u2019s what it feels like. Other people\u2019s eyes are limitless and that\u2019s what scares me.</p><p>There\u2019s quiet in the room for a while. Dr. Sarah doesn\u2019t say anything. She\u2019s thinking. I like it when Dr. Sarah thinks. If I could curl up in anyone\u2019s brain, I think it would be hers.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had an idea for you.\u201d She looks up. \u201cHow do you feel about making a film?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I look at her blankly. I was not expecting this. I was expecting a sheet with an exercise on it.</p><p>\u201cA documentary film. All you need is a cheap little digital video camera. Perhaps your parents will get you one, or we could find one here to lend you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what will I do with it?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m sounding deliberately stupid and uninterested because inside, I feel flustered. A film. No-one ever mentioned making a film before. Is that a thing? Is it the new version of cupcakes?</p><p>\u201cI think this may be a good way for you to transition from where you are now to...\u201d Dr. Sarah pauses. \u201cTo where we want you to be.

DAY.</p><p>The camera pans around a cluttered family kitchen.</p><p>AUDREY (VOICE-OVER)</p><p>So, welcome to my documentary. This is the kitchen. This is the kitchen table. Frank hasn\u2019t cleared away his breakfast, he\u2019s revolting.</p><p>ANGLE ON: a scrubbed pine table, bearing a used cereal bowl, a plate covered with crumbs, and a pot of Nutella with a spoon sticking out.</p> <p>AUDREY (V.O)</p><p>These are the kitchen cupboards.</p><p>ANGLE ON: a range of Shaker kitchen cupboards painted grey. The camera pans slowly across.</p><p>AUDREY (V.O.)</p><p>This is stupid. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m supposed to be filming. This is the window.</p><p>ANGLE ON: a window to the garden, where we can see an old swing set and a brand-new fire pit, still with tags on. Camera zooms in on the fire pit.</p><p>AUDREY (V.O.)</p><p>That was my dad\u2019s birthday present. He should use it, really.</p> <p>Camera swings shakily to door.</p><p>AUDREY (V.O.)</p><p>OK, so I should introduce myself. I\u2019m Audrey Turner and I\u2019m filming this because\u2014</p><p>Anyway. My mum and dad bought me this camera. They were all like, \u201cMaybe you\u2019ll become a documentary maker!\u201d I mean, they got super-excited and they spent far too much on this camera. I was like, just get me the cheapest thing, but they wanted to, so...</p><p>The camera moves jerkily through to the hall and focuses on the stairs.</p><p>AUDREY (V.O.)</p><p>That\u2019s the stairs. You can see that, right? You\u2019re not a moron.</p><p>I don\u2019t even know who you are. Who\u2019s watching this? Dr. Sarah, I suppose. Hi, Dr. Sarah.</p><p>The camera moves unsteadily up the stairs.</p><p>AUDREY (V.O.)</p><p>So we\u2019re going upstairs now. Who lives in THIS house?</p><p>Camera focuses on a black lacy bra draped over the bannisters.</p><p>AUDREY (V.O.)</p><p>That\u2019s Mum\u2019s.</p><p>(beat)</p><p>Actually, she may not want you to see that.</p><p>Camera turns a corner and focuses on an ajar door.</p><p>AUDREY (V.O.)</p><p>That\u2019s Frank\u2019s room, but I can\u2019t even go near it because of the stench. I\u2019ll zoom in.</p><p>Camera zooms in on an area of floor space covered with trainers, dirty socks, a wet towel, three Scott Pilgrim books, a half-empty bag of Haribo, all thrown on top of each other.</p><p>AUDREY (V.O.)</p><p>The entire room\u2019s like that. Just so you know.</p><p>Camera moves away, along an upstairs landing.</p><p>AUDREY (V.O.)</p><p>And this is my mum and dad\u2019s room...</p><p>Camera focuses on a half-open door. From inside the room, we hear a voice. This is MUM, Audrey\u2019s mum. She is talking in a low, urgent voice which, nevertheless, we can hear.</p><p>MUM (V.O)</p><p>I was talking about it at book group and Caroline said, \u201cDoes he have a girlfriend?\u201d Well, he doesn\u2019t! Is THAT the problem? If he had a girlfriend, maybe he\u2019d be out more, instead of hunched over that screen. I mean, why DOESN\u2019T he have a girlfriend?</p><p>DAD (V.O.)</p><p>I don\u2019t know. Don\u2019t look at me like that! It\u2019s not my fault!</p><p>AUDREY (V.O.)</p><p>(sotto voce)</p><p>This is my mum and dad. I think they\u2019re talking about Frank.</p><p>MUM (V.O.)</p><p>Well, I\u2019ve had an idea. We need to throw a party for him. Set him up with some pretty girls.</p><p>DAD (V.O.)</p><p>A PARTY? Are you serious?</p><p>MUM (V.O.)</p><p>Why not? It would be fun. We used to throw him some lovely parties.</p><p>DAD (V.O.)</p><p>When he was EIGHT. Anne, do you know what teenage parties are like?

Right, of course.</p><p>(calls warningly)</p><p>Sweetheart, Audrey\u2019s filming...</p><p>Mum appears at the door, dressed in a skirt and bra.

Here\u2019s to a great film. Maybe warn us next time you\u2019re filming?</p><p>(glances at Dad and clears her throat)</p><p>We were just discussing the...er...crisis in...the Middle East.</p><p>DAD</p><p>The Middle East.</p><p>Both parents look uncertainly at the camera.</p><p>OK, so the backstory. You\u2019ll want to know that, I suppose. Previously, in Audrey Turner\u2019s life...</p><p>Except, Jeez. I can\u2019t go into it all again. Sorry, I just can\u2019t. I\u2019ve sat in enough rooms with teachers, doctors, regurgitating the same story, using the same words, till it starts to feel like something that happened to someone else.</p><p>Everyone involved has started to feel unreal. All the girls at Stokeland Girls\u2019 School; Miss Amerson, our head teacher, who said I was deluded and seeking attention. (Attention. Irony God, are you listening?)</p><p>No-one ever quite found out why. I mean, we sort of found out why, but not why.</p><p>There was a big scandal, yadda yadda. Three girls were excluded, which is a record. My parents took me out of Stokeland instantly, and I\u2019ve been at home ever since. Well, and hospital, which I told you about already. The idea is that I \u201cstart again\u201d at the Heath Academy. Only to \u201cstart again\u201d you need to be able to \u201cget out of the house,\u201d which is where I have a teeny problem.</p><p>It\u2019s not the outside per se. It\u2019s not trees or air or sky. It\u2019s the people. I mean, not all people. Probably not you; you\u2019d be fine. I have my comfort people\u2014people I can talk to and laugh with and feel relaxed with. It\u2019s just, they make up quite a small group. Tiny, you might call it, compared to, say, the world\u2019s population. Or even the number of people on an average bus.</p><p>I can eat supper with my family. I can go to see Dr. Sarah in my safe little bubble of car-waiting-room-Dr.-Sarah\u2019s-room-car-home. All the people in my therapy groups at St. John\u2019s\u2014they\u2019re comfort people too. Because they\u2019re not a threat. (OK, OK, I know people aren\u2019t really a threat. But try telling my stupid brain that.)</p><p>It\u2019s everyone else who is the problem. People on the street, people at the front door, people on the phone. You have no idea how many people there are in the world until you start getting freaked out by them. Dr. Sarah says I may never be comfortable in massive crowds, and that\u2019s OK, but I have to \u201cdial down\u201d the thoughts that are telling me to panic. When she\u2019s telling me this, it seems totally reasonable, and I think \u201cYes! I can do that! Easy.\u201d But then a postman comes to the door and I run before I can even stop myself.</p><p>Thing is, I was never exactly out there, even when I was OK. In a bunch of girls, I was the one standing alone, hiding behind her hair. I was the one trying to join in chat about bras even though, hello, a bra? That would surely require a female shape. I was the one paranoid that everyone must be looking at me, thinking how uncool I was.</p><p>At the same time, I was the one who got shown off to all the visitors: \u201cOur straight-A student, Audrey.\u201d \u201cOur netball star, Audrey.\u201d</p><p>Top tip to all teachers reading this (i.e., none, probably): try not showing off the girl who cringes when anyone even looks at her. Because it\u2019s not that helpful. Also, it\u2019s not that helpful to say in the whole class\u2019s earshot: \u201cShe\u2019s the great hope of this year group, so talented.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Who wants to be the great hope?

I\u2019ve seen those babies, and they go from happy and gurgling to howling in a heartbeat. Well, I don\u2019t howl. Not quite.</p> <p>But I feel like howling.</p><p>You still want to know, don\u2019t you? You\u2019re still curious. I mean, I don\u2019t blame you.</p><p>Here\u2019s the thing: does it matter exactly what happened and why those girls were excluded? It\u2019s irrelevant. It happened. Done. Over. I\u2019d rather not go into it.</p><p>We don\u2019t have to reveal everything to each other. That\u2019s another thing I\u2019ve learned in therapy: it\u2019s OK to be private. It\u2019s OK to say no. It\u2019s OK to say, \u201cI\u2019m not going to share that.\u201d So, if you don\u2019t mind, let\u2019s just leave it there.</p><p>I mean, I appreciate your interest and concern, I really do.

It was in the Daily Mail.\u201d</p><p>Forty minutes later they pant back into the hall. I say pant. Frank\u2019s barely broken a sweat, whereas Mum looks like she\u2019s going to collapse. Her face is red and her hair is dripping. She clutches onto the bannister for support, and breathes in and out like a traction engine.</p><p>\u201cHow was the running?\u201d begins Dad, coming into the hall, and stops in alarm as he sees Mum. \u201cAnne, are you OK?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d manages Mum. \u201cFine. Frank did very well, in fact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind Frank, what about you?\u201d Dad is still staring at her. \u201cAnne, did you overdo it? I thought you were fit!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am fit!\u201d she practically yells. \u201cHe tricked me!\u201d</p><p>Frank is shaking his head sadly. \u201cMum\u2019s cardio could really do with some work,\u201d he says. \u201cMum, you only get one body. You need to treasure it.\u201d</p><p>And, winking at me, he ambles off to the playroom.</p> <p>I mean, Frank has a point.</p><p>But Mum has a point too. Everyone has a point.</p><p>After he went for that run with Mum, Frank spent the next ten hours playing computer games. Ten hours solid. Mum and Dad were out all day with Felix, taking him to a series of birthday parties, and they told Frank to do his homework while they were out and Frank said yes and then he logged on and that was it.</p><p>Now it\u2019s Sunday morning and Mum is at tennis and Dad is doing something in the garden and I\u2019m watching telly in the den when Frank appears at the door.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d My dark glasses are already on and I don\u2019t turn my head.</p> <p>\u201cListen, Audrey, Linus is going to be spending a lot of time at our house. I think you should get to know him. He\u2019s on my LOC team.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve already stiffened a little at the words Linus and get to know him.</p><p>\u201cWhy do I need to get to know him?\u201d I counter.</p><p>\u201cHe feels weird coming to our house. Like, what happened the other day? When you ran away? It freaked him out a bit.\u201d</p><p>I scowl at Frank. I don\u2019t want to be reminded.</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t need to feel weird,\u201d I say, wrapping my arms round my knees.</p><p>\u201cWell, he does. He thinks he upset you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, tell him. You know. About...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell then.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s silence. Frank still doesn\u2019t look happy.</p><p>\u201cIf Linus doesn\u2019t want to come to our house, he might join another LOC team,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd he\u2019s really good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho else is on the team?\u201d I swivel round to face Frank.</p><p>\u201cThese two guys from school. Nick and Rameen. They play online. But Linus and I are like the strategists. We\u2019re going to enter the LOC International Tournament, and the qualifiers are on July eighteenth, so we need a ton of practice. The prize pot is six million dollars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I stare up at him.</p><p>\u201cSeriously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou win six million dollars? Just for playing LOC?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot \u2018just\u2019 for playing LOC,\u201d says Frank impatiently. \u201cIt\u2019s the new spectator sport.\u201d He looks more animated than I\u2019ve seen him for ages. \u201cThey\u2019re holding it in Toronto and they\u2019re building like this massive stadium, and everyone\u2019s flying in. It\u2019s big money. This is what Mum and Dad don\u2019t get. These days, being a gamer is a career choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I say dubiously. I went to a careers fair at school.</p><p>I didn\u2019t see anyone sitting at a stall under a sign, BECOME A GAMER!</p><p>\u201cSo you need to make Linus feel comfortable here,\u201d Frank finishes. \u201cI can\u2019t lose him off my team.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you go to his house?\u201d</p><p>Frank shakes his head. \u201cWe tried. His granny\u2019s there. She\u2019s got some dementia thing. She won\u2019t leave us alone. She shouts and she cries and sometimes she doesn\u2019t know who Linus is, and she keeps taking everything out of the freezer. They, like, have to watch her all the time. Linus has to do all his homework at school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d I digest this. \u201cPoor Linus. Well...you know. Tell him it\u2019s all fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe asked for your number, but...\u201d Frank shrugs.</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t have a phone number at the moment. Just to add to the party, I\u2019ve become phone-averse. Not phobic, just averse. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Which Frank will never understand in a million years.</p><p>He heads off and I switch over to You\u2019ve Been Framed. Felix comes in to watch it with me and we snuggle up on the sofa together. Felix is like a walking, talking teddy bear. He\u2019s soft and snuggly and if you press him in the tummy he laughs, every time. His head is a curly mass of blond like a dandelion clock and his face is constantly open and hopeful. You feel like nothing must ever go wrong for him, ever.</p><p>Which is, I guess, how Mum and Dad felt about me.</p><p>\u201cSo, how\u2019s school, Felix?\u201d I say. \u201cAre you still friends with Aidan?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAidan has chicken pops,\u201d he tells me.</p><p>\u201cChicken pox?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChicken pops,\u201d he corrects me, as though I\u2019m an idiot. \u201cChicken pops.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right.\u201d I nod. \u201cI hope you don\u2019t get them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will fight the chicken pops with my sword,\u201d he says importantly. \u201cI\u2019m a very strong fighter.\u201d</p> <p>I take off my dark glasses and look into his round, open little face. Felix is the only one I can cope with looking at, eye to eye. My parents\u2019 eyes\u2014forget it. They\u2019re full of worry and fear and too much knowledge. And kind of too much love, if that makes sense? If I look at them, it\u2019s like it all comes flooding back over me in a gush\u2014mingled in with their anger, which is pretty righteous. I mean, it\u2019s not directed at me, obviously, but still. It feels toxic.</p><p>Frank\u2019s eyes are just a little freaked out every time he looks at me. It\u2019s like, Help, my sister went nuts, what should I do? He doesn\u2019t want to be freaked out, but he is. Well, of course he is. His sister hides inside and wears dark glasses\u2014what else could he be?</p><p>But Felix\u2019s blue eyes are as transparent and clear and soothing as a drink of water. He knows pretty much nothing except the fact that he\u2019s Felix.</p><p>\u201cHello, you,\u201d I say, and press my face close against his.</p><p>\u201cHello, you.\u201d He squashes up even closer. \u201cDo you want to build a snowman?\u201d</p><p>Felix has a bit of a Frozen obsession, for which I don\u2019t blame him. I can relate to Queen Elsa myself. Only I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m going to melt the ice away by some random act of love. Chip it away with an ice pick, more like.</p> <p>\u201cAudrey.\u201d I hear Frank\u2019s voice. \u201cLinus is here. He sent you this.\u201d</p><p>My dark glasses are back on as I raise my head from Felix. Frank is holding out a folded sheet of paper.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I say, nonplussed, and take it from him. \u201cOK.\u201d</p><p>As Frank heads away, I unfold the sheet and read the unfamiliar handwriting.</p><p>Hi. Sorry about the other day. I didn\u2019t mean to freak you out.</p><p>Linus</p><p>Oh God.</p><p>I mean, oh God on so many levels. First, he thinks he freaked me out. (Which he did, but not because he\u2019s freaky.) Second, he feels the need to apologise, which makes me feel bad. Third, what do I do now?</p> <p>I think for an instant, then write underneath:</p><p>No, I\u2019m sorry. I have this weird thing. It\u2019s not you.</p><p>Audrey</p><p>\u201cFelix,\u201d I say. \u201cGo and give this to Linus. Linus,\u201d I repeat as he stares at me with blank eyes. \u201cFrank\u2019s friend. Linus? The big boy?\u201d</p><p>Felix takes the paper and looks at it carefully for a moment. Then he folds it up, puts it in his pocket, and starts playing with a train.</p><p>\u201cFelix, go on,\u201d I prod him. \u201cGive it to Linus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it fits in my pocket,\u201d he objects. \u201cIt\u2019s my pocket paper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not yours. It\u2019s a note.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want a pocket paper!\u201d He screws up his face to howl.</p><p>For God\u2019s sake. In movies, they fix the note to a dog\u2019s collar and it trots off obediently, no nonsense.</p><p>\u201cOK, Felix, you can have a pocket paper,\u201d I say in exasperation. \u201cWhatever that is. Here you are.\u201d I rip a page out of a magazine, fold it up and stuff it in his pocket instead. \u201cNow give this one to Linus. In the playroom.\u201d</p><p>When Felix finally leaves, I have no confidence that the note will reach its destination. It\u2019s a thousand times more likely that Felix will feed it into the waste disposal or the DVD player or just forget it exists. I turn up You\u2019ve Been Framed and try to forget about it.</p><p>But about two minutes later there\u2019s Felix holding the note, saying excitedly, \u201cRead it! Read the pocket paper!\u201d</p><p>I unfold it\u2014and Linus has added a new line. This is like a game of Consequences.</p><p>Frank explained. Must be tough for you.</p><p>I smooth the paper out on my knee and write:</p><p>It\u2019s fine. Well, you know, not fine. It is what it is. Hope you\u2019re winning.

You are a bad influence, Audrey.</p><p>I look at the way he wrote my name. It feels intimate. It feels like he\u2019s taken hold of a piece of me. I try to hear his voice saying the word.

He\u2019s totally got into his role as go-between. \u201cDraw the words.\u201d He jabs the paper. \u201cWords!\u201d</p> <p>I don\u2019t want to give this paper to Felix anymore. I want to fold it up and keep it somewhere where I can look at it in private. Study his writing. Think about him forming my name with his pen. Audrey.</p><p>I grab a fresh piece of paper from the side table where all my school supplies are stacked and scribble on it.</p><p>Well, it\u2019s been nice chatting or whatever. See you.</p><p>I send it off and half a minute later the reply comes:</p><p>See you.</p> <p>I\u2019m still holding the first paper; the one with my name on it. I press it to my face and inhale. I think I can smell his soap or shampoo or whatever.</p><p>Felix is pressing his nose to the other paper and he looks at me over the top with huge eyes.</p><p>\u201cYour pocket paper smells like poo,\u201d he says, and bursts into laughter.</p><p>Trust a four-year-old to ruin the mood.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Felix.\u201d I ruffle his hair. \u201cYou\u2019re a great messenger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDraw more words,\u201d he says, patting the paper. \u201cMore words.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve finished our chat,\u201d I say, but Felix picks up a crayon and hands it to me.</p><p>\u201cMake red words,\u201d he commands me. \u201cMake \u2018Felix.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>I write \u201cFelix\u201d and he gazes at it lovingly as I draw him close for another restoring cuddle.</p><p>I feel kind of exhilarated.

It\u2019s all good.</p><p>OK, so here\u2019s a life lesson. Don\u2019t try fixing a birthday cake with ketchup. Tipp-Ex would have been better.</p><p>As Dad brought out the cake, Mum\u2019s jaw dropped. And not in a good way. I mean, if you take a white iced cake and pipe it all over with ketchup, it basically looks like the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. We all launched into \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d extra loudly, and as soon as we\u2019d finished and Mum had blown out her (one) candle, Dad said, \u201cGreat! So let me take that away and cut it up\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d Mum put a hand on his. \u201cWhat IS that? That\u2019s not ketchup?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a Heston Blumenthal recipe,\u201d said Dad without blinking. \u201cExperimental.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Mum still looked puzzled. \u201cBut isn\u2019t that...\u201d Before anyone could stop her, she was scraping the ketchup off with a napkin. \u201cI thought so! There\u2019s a message underneath.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d said Dad quickly.</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s piped in icing!\u201d She wiped away the last blobs of ketchup and we all stared in silence at the smeared red-and-white cake.</p><p>\u201cChris,\u201d said Mum at last in an odd voice. \u201cWhy does it say thirty-nine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t! It says thirty-eight. Look.\u201d Dad\u2019s hand traced over the vestiges of the ketchup. \u201cThat\u2019s an eight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNine.\u201d Felix pointed confidently at the cake. \u201cNumber nine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an eight, Felix!\u201d said Dad sharply. \u201cEight!\u201d</p><p>I could see Felix staring at the cake in puzzlement and felt a twinge of sympathy for him. How\u2019s he supposed to learn anything with nutso parents like ours?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a nine, Felix,\u201d I whispered in his ear. \u201cDaddy\u2019s joking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think I\u2019m thirty-nine?\u201d Mum looked up at Dad. \u201cDo I look thirty-nine? Is that what you think?\u201d She squashed her face between her hands and glared at him. \u201cIs this a thirty-nine-year-old face? Is that what you\u2019re telling me?\u201d</p><p>I think Dad should have just junked the cake.</p><p>So this evening my dad is taking my mum on a date for her birthday, which you can tell from the clouds of perfume that suddenly descend onto the landing. Mum isn\u2019t exactly subtle when she goes out. As she always tells us, her social life is practically nonexistent since having three kids, so when she goes out, she makes up for it with perfume, eye liner, hair spray and heels. As she totters down the stairs, I can see a little fake-tan blotch on the back of her arm, but I won\u2019t tell her. Not on her birthday.</p><p>\u201cWill you be all right, darling?\u201d She puts her hands on my shoulders and looks anxiously at me. \u201cYou\u2019ve got our numbers. Any problems, you tell Frank to call, straightaway.\u201d</p><p>Mum knows I\u2019m not brilliant with phones.

Have an early night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d I promise.</p><p>\u201cAnd, Frank.\u201d She looks up as he lopes into the hall. \u201cYou will be doing homework only.

Yes, young man, I did. I don\u2019t want that computer going on for a nanosecond. If you finish your homework you can watch TV or read a book. Read some Dickens!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDickens,\u201d echoes Frank in disparaging tones.</p><p>\u201cYes, Dickens! Why not? When I was your age\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Frank cuts her off. \u201cYou went to see Dickens live. And he rocked.\u201d</p> <p>Mum rolls her eyes. \u201cVery funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo! Where\u2019s the birthday girl?\u201d Dad comes hurrying down the stairs, bringing with him a cloud of aftershave. What is it with parents and too much perfume? \u201cNow, are you guys OK?\u201d He looks at me and Frank. \u201cBecause we\u2019ll only be round the corner.\u201d</p><p>My parents cannot leave the house. Mum has to do a final check on Felix, and Dad remembers he left the sprinkler on in the garden and then Mum wants to make sure that her Sky Plus is recording East Enders.</p><p>Eventually we chivvy them out and look at each other.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll be back in, like, an hour,\u201d predicts Frank, and heads off to the playroom. I follow him because I don\u2019t have much else to do, and I might read his new Scott Pilgrim. He goes to his computer station, rummages around in his school bag, and produces a power cable. Then he plugs in his computer and logs in, and up pops a game of LOC.</p> <p>\u201cDid you know Mum was going to take your cable?\u201d I ask, impressed.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s done it before. I\u2019ve got like five of them.\u201d His eyes glaze over as he starts playing and I know there\u2019s no point talking to him. I look around for the Scott Pilgrim, find it under an empty jumbo Hula Hoops packet, and curl up to read it on the sofa.</p><p>It seems about a moment later that I glance up to see Mum at the door, standing there in her heels. How did that happen?</p><p>\u201cMum.\u201d I blink, disoriented. \u201cAren\u2019t you out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI came back for my phone.\u201d Her tone is sweet and ominous. \u201cFrank? What are you doing?\u201d</p><p>Oh God. Frank. Frank! My head whips round in apprehension. Frank is still moving his mouse around the mat, his earphones on.</p> <p>\u201cFrank!\u201d Mum barks, and he looks up.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d says Mum, in the same sweet, ominous tone.</p><p>\u201cLanguage lab,\u201d says Frank, without missing a beat.</p><p>\u201cLanguage...what?\u201d Mum seems wrong-footed.</p><p>\u201cFrench homework. It\u2019s a vocab-testing program. I had to find an old power cable to do it. I thought you wouldn\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>He points at the monitor, and I see armoire floating round the screen in a big red font, followed by wardrobe in blue.</p><p>Wow. He must have moved quickly to get that up on-screen.</p> <p>Actually, playing LOC does improve your reaction times. I mean, that\u2019s a real thing.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been doing language lab all this time?\u201d Mum glances at me with narrowed eyes, and I look away. I am not getting into this.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been reading Scott Pilgrim,\u201d I say truthfully.</p><p>Mum\u2019s focus returns to Frank. \u201cFrank, are you lying to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLying?\u201d Frank looks hurt.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t give me that! Are you telling me, hand on heart, that you\u2019ve been doing your homework and nothing else?\u201d</p><p>Frank just stares at her for a moment. Then he shakes his head, his face sad.</p><p>\u201cYou adults. You think teenagers lie. You assume teenagers lie. That\u2019s the starting point. It\u2019s infinitely depressing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t assume anything\u2014\u201d begins Mum, but he cuts her off.</p><p>\u201cYou do! All of you make these easy, obvious, lazy assumptions that anyone under the age of eighteen is a pathological, dishonest, sub-human with no integrity. But we\u2019re people, just like you, and you don\u2019t seem to get that!\u201d His face is suddenly passionate. \u201cMum, can\u2019t you just for once believe that your son might be doing the right thing? Can\u2019t you just for once give me an ounce of credit? But, look, if you want me to disconnect the computer and not do my French homework, that\u2019s fine. I\u2019ll tell the teacher tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Mum looks thrown by Frank\u2019s little speech. In fact, she looks quite chastened.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say you were lying! I just...Look, if you\u2019re doing French homework, that\u2019s fine. Carry on. I\u2019ll see you later.\u201d</p><p>She tip-taps down the hall, and a few moments later we hear the front door close.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sick,\u201d I say, without looking up from my book. Frank doesn\u2019t reply. He\u2019s already engrossed in his game again. I turn a page and listen to Frank\u2019s mutterings, and wonder whether to go and make a hot chocolate, when suddenly there\u2019s the most almighty banging on the window, from outside. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFRAAAAAAANK!!!\u201d</p><p>I jump a mile, and feel myself start to hyperventilate.

I\u2019VE CAUGHT HIM RED-HANDED!\u201d</p><p>How is she even up there? The windows of the playroom are like, eight feet off the ground outside.</p><p>I glance at Frank, and he looks genuinely a bit freaked out. He\u2019s closed down LOC, but she saw it. I mean, there\u2019s no way she didn\u2019t see it.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re for it,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d Frank scowls. \u201cI can\u2019t believe she would spy on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChris!\u201d Mum is yelling. \u201cHelp! I...Arrrgh!\u201d</p><p>Her face disappears from the window and there\u2019s a loud crunch.</p><p>Oh my God. What just happened? I leap to my feet and run to the back door. The window of the playroom backs onto the garden, and as I head out, I can\u2019t see Mum anywhere. All I can see is Felix\u2019s playhouse, pulled up to the playroom window. But the roof seems to have broken, and\u2014</p> <p>No.</p><p>No way.</p><p>Mum\u2019s feet are poking out of it, still in her high heels.</p><p>Frank arrives on the back step, and sees what I\u2019m looking at. He claps a hand over his mouth and I nudge him.</p><p>\u201cShut up! She might be hurt! Mum, are you OK?\u201d I call, hurrying over to the playhouse.</p><p>\u201cAnne!\u201d Dad has arrived on the scene. \u201cWhat happened? What were you doing?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI was looking in the window,\u201d comes Mum\u2019s stifled voice. \u201cGet me out of here. I\u2019m totally wedged in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought standing on the playhouse was a bad example to Felix, Mum,\u201d says Frank blandly, and I hear a furious gasp.</p><p>\u201cYou little...\u201d It\u2019s probably a good thing Mum\u2019s voice is muffled at that point.</p><p>It takes me, Dad, and Frank together to haul Mum out of the playhouse, and I can\u2019t say it improves her mood. As she brushes her hair down, she\u2019s shaking with fury.</p><p>\u201cRight, young man,\u201d she says to Frank, who is staring sullenly at the floor. \u201cWell, you have cooked your goose. You are hereby banned from playing any computer games for...what do you think, Chris?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne day,\u201d says Dad firmly, just as Mum says, \u201cTwo months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChris!\u201d says Mum. \u201cOne day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know!\u201d says Dad defensively. \u201cDon\u2019t put me on the spot.\u201d</p> <p>Mum and Dad go off in a huddle and start whispering, while Frank and I wait awkwardly. I could go inside, I suppose, but I want to see how it all works out.</p><p>This is pretty lame, though, having to stand here while they whisper things like \u201cReally get the message across\u201d and \u201cMake it count.\u201d</p><p>When I\u2019m a parent I\u2019m so going to work out the punishment first.</p><p>\u201cOK.\u201d Dad eventually emerges from the huddle. \u201cTen days. No computer, no phone, nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTen days?\u201d Frank gives Dad one of his death-ray, please-die-now stares. \u201cThat is so out of proportion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is not.\u201d Mum holds out her hand. \u201cPhone, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what about my teammates? I can\u2019t just let them down. All that bullshit you give me about team spirit and \u2018all pull together\u2019? And now I just let the side down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat teammates?\u201d Mum looks confused. \u201cIs this the cross-country team?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy LOC teammates!\u201d says Frank. \u201cWe\u2019re practicing for the tournament, like I\u2019ve told you a billion times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA computer game tournament?\u201d says Mum, in supreme disdain.</p><p>\u201cThe international LOC tournament! The prize pot is six million dollars! That\u2019s why Linus comes round the whole time! What do I say to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell him you\u2019re busy,\u201d says Mum crisply. \u201cIn fact, I\u2019d rather Linus didn\u2019t come round anymore. I think you should find some friends with wider interests. And he upset Audrey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLinus is my friend!\u201d Frank looks like he wants to explode. \u201cYou can\u2019t ban my frigging friends!\u201d</p><p>OK, \u201cfrigging\u201d was a mistake. I can see Mum drawing herself up like a cobra ready to strike.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t swear, Frank,\u201d she says icily. \u201cAnd yes I can. This is my house. I control who comes in and out of it. You know Audrey had an attack when he was here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe won\u2019t have any more attacks,\u201d says Frank at once. \u201cAudrey\u2019s getting used to Linus, aren\u2019t you, Audrey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s OK,\u201d I say weakly.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll discuss it,\u201d says Mum, giving Frank another icy stare. \u201cFor now, can I trust you to carry on with your homework tonight, and not produce another power cable, or do I have to cancel my birthday dinner, the one Dad and I have been looking forward to all month and which has already been half-ruined?\u201d She looks at her legs. \u201cMy tights are totally ruined.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When she puts it like that, you do feel guilty.

We hear the car doors bang and they\u2019re off again.</p><p>\u201cTen days,\u201d says Frank at last, closing his eyes.</p><p>\u201cIt could have been two months,\u201d I say, trying to make him feel better, and immediately realizing this is a really lame and annoying thing to say. \u201cI mean...sorry. That sucks.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>We go inside and I head towards the kitchen.

It\u2019s that name. Linus. It does that to me.</p><p>\u201cHe needs to come round here. He needs a space to practice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Mum won\u2019t let you play.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOnly for ten days.\u201d He waves his hand impatiently. \u201cThen we need to get some serious hours in. It\u2019s the qualifiers coming up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d I spoon hot chocolate powder into my mug.</p><p>\u201cSo you can\u2019t freak out when you see him. I mean, not \u2018freak out,\u2019 \u201d he amends at my expression. \u201cHave an attack. Whatever. I know it\u2019s really serious. I know it\u2019s an illness, blah blah, I know all that.\u201d</p><p>Frank was dragged along to a family therapy group thing a couple of times. Actually, he was really sweet at it. He said some nice things to me. And about me, and what happened, and\u2014</p><p>Anyway.</p><p>\u201cThe point is, Linus needs to come here, without Mum getting on my case,\u201d Frank is saying. \u201cSo you have to be able to look at him and not run away or whatever. OK?\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s a pause. I pour boiling water into my mug and watch the powder swirling round, turning from a dusty nothing into sublime hot chocolate in seconds. All it takes is one extra element to transform it. I think about that every time I make hot chocolate.</p><p>Which is not a good thing, by the way. I think too much. Waaaay too much. Everyone\u2019s agreed on that.</p><p>\u201cTry, at any rate,\u201d Frank says. \u201cPlease?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK.\u201d I shrug, and take a sip of hot chocolate.</p><p>MY SERENE AND LOVING FAMILY\u2014FILM TRANSCRIPT</p><p>INTERIOR. 5 ROSEWOOD CLOSE. DAY.</p><p>Mum, Dad and Frank are sitting round the breakfast table. Mum is reading the Mail. Dad is on his BlackBerry.</p><p>The camera zooms in on Frank. He looks thunderous and sulky.</p> <p>MUM</p><p>So, Frank, what are you doing today after school?</p><p>Frank doesn\u2019t reply.</p><p>MUM</p><p>Frank?</p><p>Frank is silent.</p><p>MUM</p><p>FRANK?</p><p>She nudges Dad with her foot. Dad looks up, bewildered.</p><p>MUM</p><p>CHRIS!</p><p>She nods meaningfully at Frank. Dad cottons on.</p><p>DAD</p><p>Frank, don\u2019t be so rude. We live in a family here. We communicate. Answer your mother.</p><p>FRANK</p><p>(rolls eyes)</p><p>I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing after school. Not playing computer games, clearly.</p><p>MUM</p><p>Well, I want you to go through your shirts. I don\u2019t know what happens to them. Chris, we can go through yours too.</p><p>Dad is working on his BlackBerry.</p><p>MUM</p><p>CHRIS? CHRIS?</p><p>Dad is too absorbed to hear.</p><p>FRANK</p><p>Dad? Family? Communicate? Family?</p><p>He waves a hand in front of Dad\u2019s face and Dad finally looks up. He blinks at Frank.</p><p>DAD</p><p>No, you CANNOT go out tonight. You are grounded, young man.</p><p>He looks at the blank faces. Realizes he\u2019s got it wrong.</p><p>DAD</p><p>I mean...stack the dishwasher.</p><p>(He tries again.)</p><p>I mean, put your laundry in the right basket.</p><p>(gives up)</p><p>Whatever your mother says.</p><p>It\u2019s the next night that Frank appears at the door of the den and says, with no preamble, \u201cI\u2019m going to bring Linus in to say hello.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I say, trying to sound relaxed and casual. \u201cOK.\u201d</p><p>Relaxed and casual? What a joke. Already my whole body is tense. Already my breath is coming faster. Panic is rocketing round my body. I\u2019m losing control. I hear Dr. Sarah\u2019s voice, and try to recall her soothing presence.</p><p>Allow the feelings to be there.</p><p>Acknowledge your lizard brain.</p><p>Reassure your lizard brain.</p><p>My damn lizard brain.</p><p>The thing about brains, which you might not know, is they\u2019re not just one ball of jelly. They\u2019re all divided up into bits, and some bits are great and some are just a waste of space. In my humble opinion.</p><p>So the one I could really do without is the lizard brain. Or the \u201camygdala,\u201d as it\u2019s called in the books. Every time you freeze in fright, that\u2019s your lizard brain taking over. It\u2019s called the lizard brain because we all had one of these even when we were lizards, apparently. It\u2019s, like, prehistoric. And it\u2019s really hard to control. I mean, OK, all bits of your brain are hard to control, but the lizard brain is the worst. It basically tells your body what to do through chemicals and electrical signals. It doesn\u2019t wait for evidence and it doesn\u2019t think, it just has instincts. Your lizard brain is totally not rational or reasonable: all it wants to do is protect you. Fight, flight, freeze. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>So I can tell myself rationally that talking to Linus in the same room and everything will be fine. No worries. What\u2019s the problem? A conversation. What could be dangerous about a conversation?</p><p>But my stupid lizard brain is all, like, \u201cRed alert! Danger! Run away! Panic! Panic!\u201d And it\u2019s pretty loud and convincing. And my body tends to listen to it, not to me. So that\u2019s the bummer.</p><p>Every muscle in my body is taut. My eyes are flicking around in fear. If you saw me now you\u2019d think there was a dragon in the room. My lizard brain is in overdrive. And even though I\u2019m telling myself frantically to ignore the stupid lizard brain, it\u2019s kind of hard when you have a prehistoric reptile banging away inside your head, yelling \u201cRun!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is Linus.\u201d Frank\u2019s voice breaks into my thoughts. \u201cI\u2019ll leave you two together.\u201d</p> <p>And before I can escape, there he is, at the door. Same brown hair, same easy smile. I feel kind of unreal. All I can hear is my own brain saying Don\u2019t run, don\u2019t run, don\u2019t run.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I manage to reply.</p><p>The thought of facing him or looking at him is impossible, so I turn away. Right away. Staring into the corner.</p><p>\u201cAre you OK?\u201d Linus takes a few steps into the room and pauses.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t look that fine,\u201d he ventures.</p><p>\u201cRight. Well.\u201d</p><p>I pause, trying to think of an explanation that doesn\u2019t involve the words weird or nutty. \u201cSometimes I get too much adrenaline in my body,\u201d I say at last. \u201cIt\u2019s just, like, a thing. I breathe too fast, stuff like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, OK.\u201d I sense that he nods, although obviously, I can\u2019t look at him, so I can\u2019t be sure.</p><p>Simply sitting here and not running away feels like riding a rodeo. It\u2019s taking a major effort. My hands are twisting themselves up in knots. I have an aching desire to grab my T-shirt and start shredding it to bits, only I have vowed to Dr. Sarah that I will stop shredding my clothes. So I will not shred my top. Even though it would make me feel a ton better; even though my fingers are dying to find a place of safety.</p> <p>\u201cThey should teach us this stuff in biology lessons,\u201d says Linus. \u201cThis is way more interesting than the life cycle of the amoeba. Can I sit down?\u201d he adds awkwardly.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>He perches on the edge of the sofa and, I can\u2019t help it, I edge away.</p><p>\u201cIs this to do with everything that...happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA bit.\u201d I nod. \u201cSo you know about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just heard stuff. You know. Everyone was talking about it.\u201d</p><p>A sick feeling rises up inside me. How many times has Dr. Sarah said to me, \u201cAudrey, everyone is not talking about you\u201d? Well, she\u2019s wrong.</p><p>\u201cFreya Hill\u2019s gone to my cousin\u2019s school,\u201d he continues. \u201cI don\u2019t know what happened to Izzy Lawton or Tasha Collins.\u201d</p> <p>I recoil at the names.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really want to talk about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. OK. Fair enough.\u201d He hesitates, then says, \u201cSo, you wear dark glasses a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a silence which I can sense he\u2019s waiting for me to fill.</p><p>And actually, why not tell him? If I don\u2019t, Frank probably will.</p><p>\u201cI find eye contact hard,\u201d I admit. \u201cEven with my family. It\u2019s too...I dunno. Too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK.\u201d He digests this for a moment. \u201cCan you do anything contact? Do you email?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I swallow down a wince. \u201cI don\u2019t do email at the moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you write notes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I write notes.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s quiet for a moment; then a piece of paper arrives by my side, on the sofa. On it is written one word:</p><p>Hi.</p><p>I smile at it, and reach for a pen.</p><p>Hi.</p><p>I pass it back along the sofa. The next minute it appears again, and we\u2019re into a backwards and forwards conversation, all on paper.</p><p>Is this easier than talking?</p><p>A bit.</p><p>Sorry I mentioned your dark glasses. Sore point.</p><p>That\u2019s OK.</p><p>I remember your eyes from before.</p><p>Before?</p><p>I came round once to see Frank. I noticed your eyes then. They\u2019re blue, right?</p><p>I can\u2019t believe he registered the colour of my eyes.</p><p>Yes. Well remembered.</p><p>I\u2019m sorry you have to go through all this.</p><p>Me too.</p><p>It won\u2019t be forever. You\u2019ll be in the dark for as long as it takes and then you\u2019ll come out.</p><p>I stare at what he\u2019s written, a bit taken aback. He sounds so confident. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>You think?</p><p>My aunt grows special rhubarb in dark sheds. They keep it dark and warm all winter and harvest it by candlelight and it\u2019s the best stuff. She sells it for a fortune, btw.</p><p>So what, I\u2019m rhubarb?</p><p>Why not? If rhubarb needs time in the dark maybe you do too.</p> <p>I\u2019m RHUBARB?!</p><p>There\u2019s a long pause. Then the paper arrives back under my nose. He\u2019s done a drawing of a rhubarb stalk with dark glasses on. I can\u2019t help a snort of laughter.</p><p>\u201cSo, I\u2019d better go.\u201d He gets to his feet.</p><p>\u201cOK. Nice to...you know. Chat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame. Well, bye, then. See you soon.\u201d</p> <p>I lift a hand, my face twisted resolutely away, desperately wishing I could turn towards him, telling myself to turn\u2014but not turning.</p><p>They talk about \u201cbody language,\u201d as if we all speak it the same. But everyone has their own dialect. For me right now, for example, swiveling my body right away and staring rigidly at the corner means, \u201cI like you.\u201d Because I didn\u2019t run away and shut myself in the bathroom.</p><p>I just hope he realizes that.</p><p>At my next appointment with Dr. Sarah, she watches my documentary so far, while making notes. Mum has come to the appointment, as she does every now and then, and she keeps up a running commentary:</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know WHAT I was wearing that day...Dr. Sarah, please don\u2019t think our kitchen is usually that untidy...Audrey, why did you film the compost heap, for goodness\u2019 sake\u201d\u2014until Dr. Sarah politely tells her to shut up. At the end she sits back in her chair and smiles at me.</p><p>\u201cI enjoyed that. You\u2019ve been a good fly on the wall, Audrey. Now I want that fly to buzz around the room a bit. Interview your family. Maybe some outsiders too. Push yourself a little.\u201d</p> <p>At the word outsiders I clench up.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of outsiders?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyone. The milkman. Or one of your old school friends?\u201d She says this casually, as though she doesn\u2019t know that my \u201cold school friends\u201d are a sore point. For a start, what \u201cold school friends\u201d? There weren\u2019t that many to begin with, and I haven\u2019t seen any of them since leaving Stokeland.</p><p>Natalie was my best friend. She wrote me a letter after I left school and her mum sent flowers and I know they call Mum every so often. I just can\u2019t reply. I can\u2019t see her. I can\u2019t face her. And it doesn\u2019t help that Mum kind of blames Natalie for what happened. Or at least, she thinks Natalie was \u201cculpable\u201d for \u201cnot acting sooner.\u201d Which is so unfair. None of it was Natalie\u2019s fault.</p><p>I mean, yes, Natalie could have said something. The teachers might have believed me sooner then. But you know what? Natalie was paralysed by stress. And I get that now. I really do.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ll do that, Audrey?\u201d Dr. Sarah has this way of pressing you until you agree to do something, and she writes it down like homework and you can\u2019t pretend it doesn\u2019t exist.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood! You need to start widening your horizons. When we suffer prolonged anxiety, we have a tendency to become self-obsessed. I don\u2019t mean that in a pejorative way,\u201d she adds. \u201cIt\u2019s simply a fact. You believe the whole world is thinking about you constantly. You believe the world is judging you and talking about you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey are all talking about me.\u201d I seize the opportunity to prove her wrong. \u201cLinus told me they were. So.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Sarah looks up from her notes and gives me that pleasant, level look of hers.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Linus?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA boy. A friend of my brother.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Sarah is looking back at her notes.</p><p>\u201cIt was Linus who visited before? When you found things difficult?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I mean, he\u2019s OK, actually. We\u2019ve talked.\u201d</p><p>A pink tinge is creeping over my face. If Dr. Sarah notices it, she doesn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a computer game addict, like Frank,\u201d says Mum. \u201cDr. Sarah, what am I going to do about my son? I mean, should I bring him to see you? What\u2019s normal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suggest we concentrate on Audrey today,\u201d says Dr. Sarah. \u201cFeel free to consult me at a different time about Frank if you feel it would be helpful. Let\u2019s return to your concern, Audrey.\u201d She smiles at me, effectively dismissing Mum.</p><p>I can see Mum bristle, and I know she\u2019ll slag off Dr. Sarah a little in the car on the way home. Mum and Dr. Sarah have a weird relationship. Mum adores Dr. Sarah, like we all do, but I think she resents her too. I think she\u2019s secretly poised for the moment when Dr. Sarah says, Well, Audrey, of course it\u2019s all the fault of your parents. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Which of course Dr. Sarah never has said. And never will.</p><p>\u201cThe truth is, Audrey,\u201d Dr. Sarah is saying, \u201cthat yes, people will probably talk about you for a fraction of the time. I\u2019m sure my patients talk about me, and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not always complimentary. But they\u2019ll get bored and move on. Can you believe that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say honestly, and Dr. Sarah nods.</p><p>\u201cThe more you engage with the outside world, the more you\u2019ll be able to turn down the volume on those worries. You\u2019ll see that they\u2019re unfounded. You\u2019ll see that the world is a very busy and varied place and most people have the attention span of a gnat. They\u2019ve already forgotten what happened. They don\u2019t think about it. There will have been five more sensations since your incident. Won\u2019t there?\u201d</p> <p>I shrug reluctantly.</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s hard for you to believe that, trapped in your own little world. And for that reason, I\u2019d like you to start making visits out of the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d My chin jerks up in horror. \u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo your local high street?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I can\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>My chest has started to rise and fall at the very idea, but Dr. Sarah ignores it.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve talked about exposure therapy. You can start with a tiny visit. A minute or two. But you need to gradually expose yourself to the world, Audrey. Or the danger is, you really will become trapped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d I swallow, unable to talk properly. \u201cBut...\u201d</p><p>There are black dots in front of my eyes. Dr. Sarah\u2019s room was always a safe space, but now I feel as though she\u2019s thrusting me into a pit of fire.</p><p>\u201cThose girls might be anywhere,\u201d says Mum, protectively grabbing my hand. \u201cWhat if she bumps into one of them? Two of them are still at school in the area, you know. I mean, it\u2019s outrageous. They should have been sent away. And when I say away, I mean away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s difficult.\u201d Dr. Sarah is focused solely on me. \u201cI\u2019m not suggesting you go out alone. But I think it\u2019s time, Audrey. I think you can do it. Call it Project Starbucks.\u201d</p> <p>Starbucks? Is she kidding?</p><p>Tears have started to my eyes. My blood is pulsing in panic. I can\u2019t go to Starbucks. I can\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a brave, strong girl, Audrey,\u201d says Dr. Sarah, as though reading my mind, and she passes me a tissue. \u201cYou need to start pushing yourself. Yes you can.\u201d</p><p>No I can\u2019t.</p><p>The next day I spend twelve solid hours in bed. Just the thought of Starbucks has sent me slithering down a tunnel of fear, to the black, dark place. Even the air seems abrasive. Every noise makes me flinch. I can\u2019t open my eyes.</p><p>Mum brings me soup and sits on my bed and strokes my hand.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too soon,\u201d she says. \u201cToo soon. These doctors get carried away. You\u2019ll get there in your own time.\u201d</p><p>My own time, I think after she\u2019s gone. What\u2019s that? What\u2019s Audrey time? Right now it feels like a slow-motion pendulum. It\u2019s lurching forwards and back, forwards and back, but the clock\u2019s not ticking round. I\u2019m not getting anywhere.</p> <p>And then three days have passed and the darkness has lifted and I\u2019m out of bed, having an argument with Frank.</p><p>\u201cThose were my Shreddies. I always eat Shreddies. You know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo you don\u2019t,\u201d I say, to be annoying. \u201cSometimes you eat pancakes.\u201d</p><p>Frank looks like he might spontaneously combust.</p><p>\u201cI eat pancakes when Mum makes pancakes. When she doesn\u2019t, I eat Shreddies. Every morning for the last five years. Ten years. And you just go and finish the packet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave muesli.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMuesli?\u201d He looks so aghast at the idea, I want to giggle. \u201cLike raisins and shit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s healthy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t even like Shreddies,\u201d he says accusingly. \u201cDo you? You only took them to wind me up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re OK.\u201d I shrug. \u201cNot as good as muesli.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI give up.\u201d Frank rests his head on his hands. \u201cYou\u2019re just trying to ruin my life.\u201d He shoots me a dark look. \u201cI preferred you lying in bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I preferred you plugged into a computer,\u201d I shoot back. \u201cYou were much less of a pain when we never saw you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrank!\u201d As Mum bursts into the kitchen, holding Felix on one hip, she looks shocked at the sight of him, collapsed on the table. \u201cSweetheart. Are you OK?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShreddies!\u201d Felix yells as soon as he sees my bowl. \u201cI want Shreddies! Please,\u201d he adds sweetly as he slithers down from Mum. \u201cPlease may I.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHere you are.\u201d I pass the bowl to Felix. \u201cYou just had to ask nicely,\u201d I inform Frank. \u201cTry learning from your brother.\u201d</p><p>Frank doesn\u2019t move a muscle.

You should be sleeping fourteen hours a night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFourteen hours?\u201d We both stare at her.</p><p>\u201cMum, even comatose people don\u2019t sleep fourteen hours a night,\u201d says Frank.</p><p>\u201cTen hours, then,\u201d she amends. \u201cSomething. I\u2019ll look it up. Are you taking vitamins?\u201d</p> <p>Mum starts randomly pulling vitamin bottles out of the cupboard. TeenVit, KidVit, Well Woman, Osteocare...I mean, it\u2019s a joke. None of us ever takes them.</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d She plonks about ten capsules in front of Frank and another load in front of me. \u201cFelix, sweetheart, come and have some magnesium.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t want nesium!\u201d he yells, and hides under the kitchen table. \u201cNo nesium!\u201d He clamps his hands over his mouth.</p><p>\u201cOh, for God\u2019s sake.\u201d Mum swallows the magnesium pill herself, and sprays herself with something called Skin Enhancer, which has been sitting in the kitchen cupboard for three years, I know for a fact.</p><p>\u201cYou need some iron,\u201d she adds to Frank. \u201cAnd an early night. I\u2019ve got a DVD planned for this evening, which we can all watch, and then straight to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds super-fun,\u201d says Frank, staring blankly into the middle distance.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a classic,\u201d adds Mum. \u201cDickens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDickens. Right.\u201d Frank shrugs like, Who cares?</p><p>\u201cAt least we\u2019ve got you off those wretched computer games!\u201d says Mum, sounding a bit too bright. \u201cIt just shows, you don\u2019t need to play them, do you? I mean, you\u2019ve barely noticed, have you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBarely noticed?\u201d Frank finally lifts his gaze to meet hers. \u201cBarely noticed? Are you joking? Barely noticed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s not like you\u2019re counting down the days until\u2014\u201d</p><p>Mum stops abruptly as Frank lifts his sleeve to reveal a digital watch strapped to his arm.</p><p>\u201cSixty-one hours, thirty-four minutes, twenty-seven seconds till the ban is lifted,\u201d he says tonelessly. \u201cI\u2019m not just counting down, all my friends are counting down. So yes, Mum, I have \u2018noticed.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>Frank can be pretty sarcastic when he wants to, and I see two little red spots appear on Mum\u2019s cheeks.</p> <p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t care!\u201d she snaps. \u201cTonight we\u2019re all going to watch Great Expectations, as a family, and believe it or not, Frank, you\u2019ll be amazed. You children think you know it all, but Dickens was one of the greatest storytellers ever, and you will be blown away by this film.\u201d</p><p>As she strides off again, Frank slumps down further on the kitchen table.</p><p>\u201cYou are so lucky,\u201d he says indistinctly. \u201cNo-one\u2019s on your case. You can do what the hell you like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do what the hell I like!\u201d I say defensively. \u201cI have to do this documentary the whole time. And now I\u2019m supposed to go to Starbucks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy Starbucks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDunno. Starbucks therapy. Whatever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Frank sounds supremely uninterested. But then, all of a sudden, he sits up. \u201cHey. Can you tell your therapist you\u2019ll be cured if you attend this year\u2019s European Gaming Expo in Munich and you have to take your brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhhhmph.\u201d Frank subsides onto the table again. Mum\u2019s right, he does look rough.</p><p>\u201cYou can have these.\u201d I give him the last remaining dregs of Shreddies, which Felix has abandoned.</p><p>\u201cYeah, right. Soggy, third-hand Shreddies covered in Felix dribble. Thanks, Audrey.\u201d Franks gives me a death stare.</p><p>Then, a moment later, he reaches for a spoon and starts shoveling them in.</p><p>MY SERENE AND LOVING FAMILY\u2014FILM TRANSCRIPT</p><p>INTERIOR. 5 ROSEWOOD CLOSE.

Wasn\u2019t that amazing? Wasn\u2019t it just the most gripping story?</p><p>FRANK</p><p>It was all right.</p> <p>MUM</p><p>\u201cAll right\u201d? Darling, it was DICKENS.</p><p>FRANK</p><p>(patiently)</p><p>Yeah. It was Dickens and it was all right.</p> <p>MUM</p><p>Well, it was better than one of your inane computer games, you have to admit that.</p><p>FRANK</p><p>No it wasn\u2019t.</p><p>MUM</p><p>Of course it was.</p> <p>FRANK</p><p>It wasn\u2019t.</p><p>MUM</p><p>(erupts)</p><p>Are you telling me that your ridiculous games can compete with a classic Dickens story? I mean, take the characters! Take Magwitch! Magwitch is unique!</p><p>FRANK</p><p>(unimpressed)</p><p>Yeah, there\u2019s a Magwitch character in LOC too. Only he has, like, a better backstory than the Dickens one. He\u2019s a convict, the same, but he can help any competitor.</p> <p>AUDREY (VOICE-OVER)</p><p>He transfers powers.</p><p>FRANK</p><p>Except the competitor has to take on one of his crimes and pay the penalty\u2014</p><p>AUDREY (V.O.)</p><p>Exactly. So you have to choose which power structure to go in at. And\u2014</p><p>FRANK</p><p>Shut up, Aud! I\u2019m explaining. Except you don\u2019t know which penalty you\u2019ve got till they make the choice. So it\u2019s like a gamble, only the more you play, the more you can work it out. It\u2019s awesome.</p><p>Mum is looking from Frank to Audrey and back again, in total bafflement.</p><p>MUM</p><p>OK, this makes no sense to me. None. What power structures? What is that?</p><p>FRANK</p><p>If you played, you\u2019d find out.</p><p>AUDREY (V.O.)</p><p>Magwitch is a pretty amazing character.</p><p>MUM</p><p>Exactly! Thank you.</p><p>A slight pause.</p><p>MUM</p><p>The Dickens Magwitch or the LOC Magwitch?</p><p>AUDREY (V.O.)</p><p>The LOC Magwitch, of course.</p><p>FRANK</p><p>The Dickens one is just a bit...</p><p>MUM</p><p>(sharply)</p><p>What? What\u2019s wrong with the Dickens Magwitch? What could be wrong with one of the great literary characters of our time?</p><p>FRANK</p><p>He\u2019s less interesting.</p><p>AUDREY (V.O.)</p><p>Exactly.</p><p>FRANK</p><p>Two-dimensional.</p><p>AUDREY (V.O.)</p><p>I mean, he doesn\u2019t DO anything.</p><p>FRANK</p><p>(kindly)</p><p>No offense. I\u2019m sure Dickens was a great guy.</p><p>MUM</p><p>(to DAD)</p><p>Are you hearing this?</p><p>Mum\u2019s been pissed off with us ever since Dickensgate. She made us tidy our rooms today, which hardly ever happens, and she found a cheeseburger in Frank\u2019s room and it all kicked off.</p><p>I don\u2019t mean a cheeseburger carton, I mean an actual cheeseburger. He\u2019d taken about two bites and put it back into the box and left it on the floor, like weeks ago. It was buried under a pile of rank sports kit. The weird thing is, the cheeseburger didn\u2019t moulder. It kind of fossilized. It was pretty gross.</p><p>Mum started on the hugest lecture about rats and vermin and hygiene, but Frank waved her away and said, \u201cI have to go, Mum, Linus is like a minute away. You always say we have to be polite to guests and greet them.\u201d He stomped downstairs and I felt a bit swoopy in my stomach.</p><p>Linus again. I didn\u2019t think we\u2019d be seeing so much of Linus while Frank was banned from computers.</p><p>Mum obviously thought the same thing, because she looked a bit thrown and called down the stairs, \u201cHe does know about your computer ban, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d and Frank said impatiently, \u201cOf course.\u201d Then he added, as he swung round into the hall, \u201cBut Linus can play LOC on my computer while he\u2019s here, can\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>Mum looked a bit flummoxed. She opened her mouth, but nothing came out. A moment later she was heading off to her bedroom, saying, \u201cChris? Chris, what do you think of this?\u201d</p><p>That was all about ten minutes ago. I know Linus is here because I heard him arrive, a few minutes ago. He went straight into the playroom with Frank and I guess they fired up LOC straightaway. Meanwhile, I could hear Mum and Dad in discussion in their bedroom.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the principle!\u201d Mum kept saying. \u201cHe\u2019s got to learn!\u201d</p><p>I think Dad was on the \u201cThey\u2019re only kids, it\u2019s all fairly harmless\u201d tack and Mum was on the \u201cScreens are evil and corrupting my son\u201d tack, and they couldn\u2019t agree, so after a while I got bored listening. I headed down to the den and here I am now, waiting.</p><p>No, not waiting.</p><p>Well, kind of waiting.</p><p>I put on an old episode of How I Met Your Mother and try not to calculate how long a game of LOC is, and whether Linus might come and say hello when he\u2019s done. Just the thought of him is giving me little twinges. Good twinges. I think.</p><p>I mean, not that he needs to say hello. It\u2019s probably the last thing he wants to do. Why would he? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Only, he did say \u201cSee you soon.\u201d Why would he say \u201cSee you soon\u201d if he was planning to ignore me for the rest of my life?</p><p>My hands are twisted up, and I try to unclench them. He won\u2019t come. He\u2019s here to see Frank, not me. I need to stop thinking about this. I turn up How I Met Your Mother and am flicking through a copy of Closer too, for good measure, when Felix comes charging towards the sofa.</p><p>\u201cThis pocket paper is for you!\u201d he announces, and thrusts a piece of A4 at me.</p><p>Hi, Rhubarb.</p> <p>He\u2019s drawn the picture of rhubarb in dark glasses again, and I feel my mouth twitch into a smile.</p><p>Hi, Orange Slice.</p><p>I\u2019m terrible at drawing, but somehow I manage a picture of a face with hair and an orange segment for a mouth.

I look up\u2014and it\u2019s him. It\u2019s Linus.</p><p>Before I know it, I\u2019ve bolted into the furthest corner of the sofa.</p><p>Stupid, dumb lizard brain.</p><p>I stare fixedly at the wall and mutter, \u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Rhubarb. So what\u2019s this \u2018orange slice\u2019 thing?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh.\u201d I can\u2019t help a tiny smile, and my fists unclench a teeny smidgen. \u201cI think your smile looks like an orange segment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mum says it\u2019s like a crescent moon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere you go, then.\u201d</p><p>He moves a little into the room. I\u2019m not looking that way, but my radar is on full twitch alert. If you spend most of your time turned away from people, you get to know what they\u2019re doing without having to see it.</p><p>\u201cSo\u2014aren\u2019t you playing?\u201d My voice comes out a little husky.</p><p>\u201cYour mum\u2019s banned me. She got a bit mad. Frank was helping me play, and she started on this thing about how he was banned, and that included sitting with his friends, telling them what to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d I nod. \u201cI can imagine. Do your parents get so stressed about computer games?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d says Linus. \u201cThey\u2019re more stressed about my granny. She lives with us and she\u2019s proper crazy. I mean\u2014\u201d</p> <p>He stops abruptly and there\u2019s a prickly silence. It takes me about three seconds to realize why.</p><p>That\u2019s what he thinks I am, hits me with a horrible thud, followed by, Of course he does.</p><p>The silence is getting worse. I can sense the word crazy floating around in the air, like the words on Frank\u2019s French vocab program.</p><p>Crazy.</p><p>Fou.</p><p>I learned that in French, before I quit school. Folie. That means crazy too, doesn\u2019t it? Only it sounds like a chic form of crazy. Crazy in, like, a Breton-striped top with red lipstick.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d says Linus.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be sorry,\u201d I say, almost aggressively. \u201cYou didn\u2019t say anything.\u201d</p><p>Which is true. He didn\u2019t say anything. He stopped midsentence.</p><p>Except that stopping midsentence is the worst thing people can do. It\u2019s like, totally passive-aggressive, because you can\u2019t take issue with anything they\u2019ve said. You have to take issue with what you think they were going to say.</p><p>Which then they deny.</p><p>The Queen of the Midsentence Stop is my mum. I mean, she\u2019s an expert. Some recent examples in no particular order:</p><p>1.</p><p>MUM: Well, I really think your so-called friend Natalie could have\u2014</p><p>Midsentence Stop.</p><p>ME: What? Prevented everything from happening? So it\u2019s her fault? We can lay everything at the door of Natalie Dexter?</p><p>MUM: Don\u2019t overreact, Audrey. I wasn\u2019t going to say that.</p><p>2.</p><p>MUM: I\u2019ve bought you some facial wash. Look, it\u2019s especially formulated for teenage skin.</p><p>ME (reading label): \u201cFor problem skin breakouts.\u201d You think I have problem skin?</p><p>MUM: Of course not, darling. But you have to admit that sometimes it\u2019s a little\u2014</p><p>Midsentence Stop.</p><p>ME: What? Rank? Gross? Like, I should walk around with a bag over my head?</p><p>MUM: Don\u2019t overreact, Audrey. I wasn\u2019t going to say that.</p><p>Anyway, so I\u2019m quite attuned to the Midsentence Stop. And Linus just stopped, totally midsentence, and I know what he was going to say. He was going to say: she\u2019s crazy like you\u2019re crazy.</p><p>He\u2019s repulsed by me. I knew it. He\u2019s only come by here because it\u2019s like entertainment, like a freak show. The girl in the dark glasses, roll up, roll up, see her cower in the corner. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The silence is going on and on, and someone has to break it, so I say tightly,</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine.

(I\u2019m getting all this from one syllable, you understand.)</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re nothing like my granny,\u201d he adds, and he gives this little laugh, like he\u2019s enjoying a private joke. \u201cIf you met her you\u2019d understand.\u201d</p> <p>Linus\u2019s voice is kind of easy. Not like Frank\u2019s, which sounds like a harsh battering ram most of the time. He laughs again and I feel like this swooshing of relief.

At least, the air around me feels prickly. Go out or anything. I feel an urge to curl up and shut my eyes.</p><p>\u201cNo. Not really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean, I\u2019m supposed to go to Starbucks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwesome. When are you going to go?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d I say it roughly, without even meaning to. \u201cIt\u2019s...I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s another silence. I\u2019m hunched away even further. I can sense his questions circulating around the silence like more vocab words: Why? How come? What\u2019s going on?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m supposed to do, like, exposure therapy,\u201d I say in a miserable rush. \u201cLike, you do a little bit at a time. But Starbucks isn\u2019t a little bit. It\u2019s huge. I just can\u2019t. So.\u201d</p><p>With every revelation, I\u2019m expecting him to leave. But he\u2019s still here.</p><p>\u201cLike allergies,\u201d he says, sounding fascinated. \u201cLike, you\u2019re allergic to Starbucks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess.\u201d This conversation is starting to wear away at my brain. I\u2019m clutching a cushion for comfort; the tendons are standing up on my hands.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re allergic to eye contact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m allergic to everything contact.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo you\u2019re not,\u201d he says at once. \u201cYou\u2019re not allergic to brain contact. I mean you write notes. You talk. You still want to talk to people, you just can\u2019t. So your body needs to catch up with your brain.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m silent for a while. No-one\u2019s put it like that before.</p><p>\u201cI suppose,\u201d I say at last.</p><p>\u201cWhat about shoe contact?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShoe contact!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s shoe contact?\u201d I\u2019d laugh, only my stupid lizard brain has disabled the laugh button for now. I\u2019m too frozen up with tension.</p><p>I am owed so much laughter. Sometimes I hope I\u2019m building up a stockpile of missing laughs, and when I\u2019ve recovered, they\u2019ll all come exploding out in one gigantic fit that lasts twenty-four hours.</p><p>Meanwhile, Linus has sat down on the sofa, at the other end from me. In my peripheral vision I see him extending a grubby trainer.</p><p>\u201cGo on,\u201d he says. \u201cShoe contact. Let\u2019s do it.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t move. I\u2019m a hedgehog rolled into a ball. I don\u2019t want to know.</p><p>\u201cYou can move your foot,\u201d says Linus. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to look at it. Just move it.\u201d</p><p>He sounds persistent. I can\u2019t believe this is happening. My lizard brain is really not liking this. It\u2019s telling me to dive under the blanket. Hide. Run. Anything.</p><p>Maybe if I don\u2019t react, I tell myself, he\u2019ll just give up and we can forget all about it.</p><p>But the seconds tick on, and he doesn\u2019t go anywhere.</p><p>\u201cGo on,\u201d he says encouragingly. \u201cI bet you can do it.\u201d</p><p>And now I have Dr. Sarah\u2019s voice in my head: You need to start pushing yourself.</p><p>Gradually, I shift my foot across the carpet, until the rubber rim of my trainer is touching the rubber rim of his. The rest of my body is still turned away. I\u2019m staring fixedly at the fabric of the sofa, my entire brain focused on the inch of foot that is in contact with his.</p><p>And OK, I know there\u2019s like two layers of trainer rubber between us, I know this could not be less erotic or romantic or whatever, and by the way, my entire body is still twisted firmly away from his as if I can\u2019t stand the sight of him. But still, it feels kind of\u2014</p><p>Well.</p><p>See how I stopped midsentence? I can do it too.

I have no idea where that came from.</p><p>Anyway. The ban is over tomorrow. Linus will be round again. And we\u2019ll see.</p><p>Except I hadn\u2019t reckoned on the apocalypse, which hit our house at 3:43 this morning. I know, because that was the time I blinked awake and stared blearily at my clock, wondering if there was a fire. There was a distant high-pitched screaming noise, which could have been an alarm, or could have been a siren, and I grabbed my robe off the floor and shoved my feet into my furry slippers and thought in a panic What do I take?</p><p>I grabbed my ancient pink teddy and my picture of me with Granny before she died, and I was halfway down the stairs when I realized that the noise wasn\u2019t a siren. Or an alarm. It was Mum. I could hear her in the playroom, and she was screaming, \u201cWhat are you DOING?\u201d</p><p>I skittered to the entrance and felt my whole body sag in astonishment. Frank was sitting at his computer playing LOC. At 3:43 a.m.</p> <p>I mean, obviously he wasn\u2019t playing LOC right that second. He\u2019d paused. But the graphics were there on the screen, and his headset was on, and he was looking up at Mum like a cornered fox.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you DOING?\u201d Mum yelled again, then turned to Dad, who had just arrived at the doorway too. \u201cWhat is he DOING? Frank, what are you DOING?\u201d</p><p>Parents have this way of asking really dumb, obvious questions.</p><p>Are you going out in that skirt?</p><p>No, I\u2019m planning to take it off as soon as I get out of the front door.</p><p>Do you think that\u2019s a good idea?</p> <p>No, I think it\u2019s a terrible idea, that\u2019s why I\u2019m doing it.</p><p>Are you listening to me?</p><p>Your voice is a hundred decibels, I can hardly avoid it.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you DOING?\u201d Mum was still shrieking, and Dad put a hand on her arm.</p><p>\u201cAnne,\u201d he said. \u201cAnne, I have an eight o\u2019clock.\u201d</p><p>Big mistake. Mum turned on him like he was the baddie.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care about your eight o\u2019clock! This is your son, Chris! Lying to us! Playing computer games at night! What else has he been doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t sleep,\u201d said Frank. \u201cOK? That\u2019s all. I couldn\u2019t sleep and I thought, I\u2019ll read a book, but I couldn\u2019t find a book, so I thought I\u2019d just...you know. Wind down.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow long have you been up?\u201d snapped Mum.</p><p>\u201cSince about two?\u201d Frank looked plaintively at her. \u201cI couldn\u2019t sleep. I think I\u2019m getting insomnia.\u201d</p><p>Dad yawned and Mum glared at him.</p><p>\u201cAnne,\u201d he said. \u201cCan we do this in the morning? It\u2019s not going to help Frank\u2019s insomnia if we all argue now. Please? Bed?\u201d He yawned again, his hair all tufty like a teddy bear\u2019s. \u201cPlease?\u201d</p><p>So that was last night. And things have not been Happy Families today. Mum gave Frank the third degree over breakfast, about: How many times has he got up in the night to play LOC? and How long has he had insomnia? and Did he realize that computer games give people insomnia?</p><p>Frank barely answered. He looked pretty gaunt and pale and out of it. The more Mum went on about circadian rhythms and light pollution and Why didn\u2019t he drink Ovaltine before bed? the more he retreated into his Frank shell.</p><p>I don\u2019t even know what Ovaltine is. Mum always brings it up when she talks about sleep. She refers to it like it\u2019s some magic potion and says \u201cWhy don\u2019t we drink it?\u201d but she\u2019s never bought any, so how can we?</p><p>So then Frank went off to school and I read Game of Thrones all morning and then fell asleep. This afternoon I\u2019ve been filming some birds in the garden, which I sense is not what Dr. Sarah wants, but it\u2019s peaceful. They\u2019re very cute. They come and eat crumbs off the bird table and fight with each other. Maybe I\u2019ll become a wildlife photographer or filmmaker or whatever. The only downer is your knees start to ache from crouching. Also, I\u2019m not sure who\u2019s going to watch an hour\u2019s footage of birds eating crumbs.</p><p>So I\u2019m pretty zoned out, and I jump in surprise when I hear a car coming into the drive. It\u2019s too early for Dad, so who is it? Maybe someone gave Frank a lift home from school. That happens sometimes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Maybe Linus.</p><p>I cautiously creep round the edge of the house and peek into the drive. To my surprise, it is Dad. He\u2019s getting out of his car in his business suit, looking a bit hassled. The next minute the front door has opened and Mum is coming down the path like she expected him.</p><p>\u201cChris! At last.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI came as soon as I could get away. But you know, I have a lot on right now...Is this really essential?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes it is! This is a crisis, Chris. A crisis with our son. And I need your support!\u201d</p><p>OMG. What happened?</p><p>I duck back into the garden and head silently into the kitchen, where I can hear them talking. I edge forward and see them coming into the hall.</p><p>\u201cI took Frank\u2019s computer to my Pilates class,\u201d Mum is saying grimly.</p><p>\u201cYou did what?\u201d Dad seems flummoxed. \u201cAnne, I know you want to keep it away from Frank, but isn\u2019t that a bit extreme?\u201d</p> <p>I have visions of Mum, staggering into the church hall, holding Frank\u2019s computer, and I have to clamp my mouth tightly closed to stop laughing. Is she going to take Frank\u2019s computer everywhere now? Like a pet?</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand!\u201d spits Mum. \u201cI took it for Arjun to have a look at.\u201d</p><p>\u201cArjun?\u201d Dad looks more baffled than ever.</p><p>\u201cArjun is in my Pilates class. He\u2019s a computer software developer and he works from home. I said, \u2018Arjun, can you tell from this computer how often my son has been playing games during the last week?\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Dad eyes her warily. \u201cAnd could Arjun tell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, he could tell,\u201d says Mum in ominous tones. \u201cHe could tell, all right.\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s silence. I can see Dad instinctively backing away, but he can\u2019t escape before the tidal wave of sound hits him.</p><p>\u201cEvery night! EVERY NIGHT! He starts at two a.m. and he logs off at six. Can you believe it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re joking.\u201d Dad seems genuinely shocked. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk Arjun.\u201d Mum proffers her phone. \u201cAsk him! He does freelance work for Google. He knows what he\u2019s talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. No, it\u2019s fine. I don\u2019t need to talk to Arjun.\u201d Dad sinks onto the stairs. \u201cJesus. Every night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe creeps around. Lies to us. He\u2019s addicted! I knew it. I knew it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK. Well, that\u2019s it, he\u2019s banned for life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLife.\u201d Mum nods.</p> <p>\u201cTill he\u2019s an adult.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least,\u201d Mum says. \u201cAt least. You know, Alison at my book group doesn\u2019t even have TV in the house. She says screens are the cigarettes of our age. They\u2019re toxic, and we\u2019re only going to realize the damage they\u2019re doing when it\u2019s too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Dad looks uneasy. \u201cI\u2019m not sure we need to go that far, do we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, maybe we should!\u201d Mum cries, sounding stressed. \u201cYou know, Chris, maybe we\u2019ve got this all wrong! Maybe we should go back to basics. Card games. Family walks. Discussions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr...OK.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean, books! What happened to books? That\u2019s what we should be doing! Reading the Booker short list! Not watching all this toxic, mindless television and playing brain-sapping video games. I mean, what are we doing, Chris? What are we doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d Dad is nodding fervently. \u201cNo, I totally agree. Totally agree.\u201d There\u2019s a slight pause before he says, \u201cWhat about Downton?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, well, Downton.\u201d Mum looks wrong-footed. \u201cThat\u2019s different. That\u2019s...you know. History.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd The Killing?\u201d</p><p>My parents are addicted to The Killing. They gorge themselves on like four episodes at a time, and then say, \u201cOne more? Just one more?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m talking about the children,\u201d says Mum at last. \u201cI\u2019m talking about the future generation. They should be reading books.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, good.\u201d Dad exhales in relief. \u201cBecause whatever else I do in my life, I\u2019m finishing The Killing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding? We have to finish The Killing,\u201d Mum agrees. \u201cWe could watch one tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could watch two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter we\u2019ve spoken to Frank.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God.\u201d Dad rubs his head. \u201cI need a drink.\u201d</p><p>The house is quiet for a while after that. It\u2019s the calm before the kickoff. Felix comes home from a playdate where they made pizza and unveils the most revolting tomatoey-cheesy mess and makes Mum heat it up in the oven. Then he refuses to eat it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Then he refuses to eat anything else, because he wants to eat the pizza he made, even though he won\u2019t eat it. I know. The logic of a four-year-old is beyond weird.</p><p>\u201cI want to eat MY pizza!\u201d he keeps wailing, whereupon Mum says, \u201cWell, eat it, then! Here it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNooo!\u201d He gazes at it tearfully. \u201cNooo! Not that one! Not THAT one!\u201d</p><p>Eventually he swipes it off the table altogether, and seeing it collapsed on the floor is too much for him. He descends into hysterical sobbing and Mum says darkly, \u201cThey probably gave him Fruit Shoots,\u201d and hauls him off for a bath. (Half an hour later he\u2019s all fluffy and clean and smiling and eating sandwiches. Baths are like Valium for four-year-olds.)</p> <p>Then I\u2019m put on make-sure-Felix-eats-his-crusts duty, so I\u2019m stuck at the kitchen table. I kind of thought I might get to Frank first and warn him. But it probably wouldn\u2019t have worked anyway, because Mum\u2019s like a sentry on speed. She goes into the hall every five minutes and opens the front door, and once she actually goes into the street, scanning the horizon all around, as if Frank might fool her by coming from some different direction. She\u2019s pretty revved up for seeing him. She keeps addressing the hall mirror with phrases like \u201cIt\u2019s the deceit as much as anything else\u201d and \u201cYes, this is tough love. It is tough love, young man.\u201d</p><p>Young man.</p><p>Meanwhile I\u2019ve kept my head well down, although I\u2019m dying to ask Frank whether he\u2019s really been getting up at two a.m., and whether Linus was playing with him. I\u2019m just secretly eating a couple of Felix\u2019s crusts for him, to speed things up, when I hear a yell from Mum. She\u2019s out in the front drive squinting along the road.</p><p>\u201cChris! Chris! He\u2019s coming!\u201d She comes striding into the house, her head swiveling around on full alert. \u201cWhere\u2019s your father? Where\u2019s he gone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDunno. Haven\u2019t seen him.\u201d</p> <p>OK, Mum\u2019s totally wired. I wonder whether I should tell her about breathing in for four counts and out for seven, but I think she\u2019d bite my head off.</p><p>\u201cChris!\u201d She stalks out of the kitchen.</p><p>I creep forward so I have a view of the hall. I should really get my video camera, only it\u2019s upstairs, and I don\u2019t want to venture across the battlefield. Dad appears at his study door, holding his BlackBerry to his ear, pulling an agonised face at Mum.</p><p>\u201cYes, the figures were unexpected,\u201d he\u2019s saying. \u201cBut if you look at page six...\u201d Sorry, he mouths at Mum. Two minutes.</p><p>\u201cGreat!\u201d she snaps as Dad disappears again. \u201cSo much for a united front.\u201d She peers out of the hall window. \u201cOK. Here he comes. Here we go.\u201d</p><p>She positions herself in the hall, her hand placed on her hip and glary eyes focused right on the door. After a tense ten seconds the door opens and I catch my breath. Frank saunters in, just the same as usual, and looks at Mum without much interest. I can see her draw herself up and take a deep breath.</p> <p>\u201cHello, Frank,\u201d she says in steely tones, which make me shiver, even though I\u2019m not the one in trouble. But Frank has his earphones in, so I\u2019m guessing he didn\u2019t pick up on the steely tones.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d he says, and makes to go past, but Mum pokes him on the shoulder.</p><p>\u201cFrank!\u201d she says, and gestures to his ears. \u201cOut!\u201d</p><p>Rolling his eyes, Frank takes out his earphones and looks at her. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d says Mum, in yet more steely tones.</p><p>\u201cWhat?</p><p>\u201cSo.\u201d</p><p>I can see her aim is to make him quake in fear with just that one syllable, but it hasn\u2019t really worked. He just looks impatient.</p> <p>\u201cSo? What do you mean? So what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been expecting you, Frank. Dad and I.\u201d She takes a step forward, her eyes like lasers. \u201cWe\u2019ve been waiting for you for quite a while.\u201d</p><p>OMG. She\u2019s totally channelling a Bond villain, I realize. I bet she wishes she had a white cat to stroke.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s my computer doing there?\u201d Frank suddenly notices it, perched on the hall table with its flex coiled around the plug.</p><p>\u201cGood question,\u201d says Mum pleasantly. \u201cWould you like to tell us about your computer activity over the last week or so?\u201d</p><p>Frank\u2019s shoulders sag, like Not this again.</p><p>\u201cI was playing LOC,\u201d he says in a monotone. \u201cYou caught me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust the once?\u201d</p><p>Frank lets his school bag slither to the ground.</p><p>\u201cI dunno. I\u2019ve got a headache. I need some paracetamol.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why would that be?\u201d Mum suddenly loses it. \u201cWould that be because you haven\u2019t had any sleep this week?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Frank gives her his special, blank, I-have-no-idea-what-you\u2019re-talking-about look, which, actually, is really annoying.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t play ignorant with me! Don\u2019t you dare play ignorant!\u201d Mum is breathing really hard by now. \u201cMy friend Arjun looked at your machine today. And what an interesting story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Arjun?\u201d Frank scowls.</p><p>\u201cA computer expert,\u201d says Mum triumphantly. \u201cHe told me all about you. You\u2019ve left quite the trail, young man. We know everything.\u201d</p> <p>I see a flicker of alarm pass across Frank\u2019s face. \u201cDid he read my emails?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He didn\u2019t read your emails.\u201d Mum looks momentarily distracted. \u201cWhat\u2019s in your emails?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d says Frank hastily, and glowers at her. \u201cJesus. I can\u2019t believe you hacked into my computer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I can\u2019t believe you\u2019ve been lying to us! You\u2019ve been up at two a.m. every night this week! Do you deny it?\u201d</p><p>Frank shrugs with a sullen expression.</p> <p>\u201cFrank?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf Arjun says it, it must be true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it is true! Frank, do you understand how serious this is? Do you? DO YOU?\u201d she suddenly yells.</p><p>\u201cWell, do you understand how seriously I take LOC?\u201d he yells back. \u201cWhat if I become a professional gamer? What will you say then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot this again.\u201d Mum closes her eyes and massages her forehead. \u201cWho were you playing with? Do I know them? Do I need to call their parents?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt it,\u201d says Frank sarcastically, \u201csince they live in Korea.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cKorea?\u201d This seems the last straw for Mum. \u201cRight. That\u2019s it, Frank. You are banned. Banned, banned, banned. Forever. No computers. No screens. No nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK,\u201d says Frank limply.</p><p>\u201cDo you understand?\u201d She stares at him, hard. \u201cYou\u2019re banned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get it. I\u2019m banned.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a silence. Mum seems dissatisfied. She\u2019s peering at Frank as though she wanted to hear something else.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re banned,\u201d she tries again. \u201cFor good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d says Frank with elaborate patience. \u201cYou told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not reacting. Why aren\u2019t you reacting?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI am reacting, Mum. I\u2019m banned. Whatever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m locking this computer right away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get it.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s another weird, tense silence. Mum is studying Frank closely, as though searching for the answer. Then suddenly her whole face seems to ping, and she draws breath.</p><p>\u201cOh my God. You don\u2019t take this seriously, do you? You think you\u2019ll get round it. What, you\u2019re already planning how you\u2019ll creep around the house at night and find your computer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Frank sounds sulky, which means Yes.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re already planning how you\u2019ll pick the lock?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think you can beat us!\u201d She\u2019s quivering now. \u201cYou think you can beat us, don\u2019t you? Well, beat this!\u201d</p><p>She grabs the computer, which is pretty bulky, and heads up the stairs, trailing the cord.</p><p>\u201cThis is going. It\u2019s going! I want it out of our house! I want it in smithereens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmithereens?\u201d Frank springs to life.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re banned anyway, so what does it matter?\u201d Mum shoots back over her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cMum, no,\u201d says Frank in a panic. \u201cMum, what are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou stay there, young man!\u201d Mum\u2019s voice is suddenly on a whole different level. She sounds properly scary, like she did when we were little kids, and Frank pauses, his foot on the step. I\u2019ve never seen him look so freaked.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s she going to do?\u201d he says in a low voice.</p><p>\u201cI dunno. But I wouldn\u2019t go upstairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what\u2019s she doing?\u201d</p><p>At that moment Felix comes bounding into the hall from the garden, in his dressing gown.</p><p>\u201cGuess what?\u201d he says in tones of joy. \u201cMummy is throwing the computer out of the window!\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t believe she did it. I can\u2019t believe she actually chucked Frank\u2019s computer out of the window.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t quite as dramatic as it might have been, because she suddenly got all health and safety and shouted to the neighbours to get out of the way, and then said to Dad that he should move the car if he was that worried.</p><p>Meanwhile Frank was lurching between total gibbering panic and trying to be one of those guys in the movies who talk the terrorist out of setting off the bomb. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMum, listen,\u201d he kept saying. \u201cPut the computer down.

It kind of bounced twice and landed on its side. In fact, it barely looked broken at all, once it was sitting on the lawn. There was just a bit of shattered glass from the screen, which Dad immediately cleared up because of Felix playing outside in bare feet or whatever.</p><p>But I guess it\u2019s messed up enough inside that Frank can\u2019t use it anymore.

But we\u2019ll get through it.</p><p>Mum lifts her coffee cup, then puts it down without drinking.</p><p>MUM</p><p>The thing about being a parent, Audrey, is that it\u2019s no picnic. You have to make difficult choices and you have to see them through. So yes, I\u2019m finding Frank a little challenging right at the moment. But you know what? He\u2019ll thank me one day.</p><p>Silence.</p><p>MUM</p> <p>Well, he might thank me.</p><p>Silence.</p><p>MUM</p><p>OK, so the thanking is unlikely. But the point is, I\u2019m a mother.

She even spoke to his teacher at school, who was, according to her, \u201cUseless! Worse than useless! He said Frank seemed \u2018fine\u2019 to him and we should \u2018let him alone.\u2019 \u2018Let him alone,\u2019 can you believe it?\u201d (I know this because I was outside Mum\u2019s room while she was sounding off to Dad.)</p><p>Tonight he\u2019s sitting at supper, eating his enchiladas without looking at anyone, staring ahead like a zombie.

Under the heading, Felix has drawn what I assume is a picture of us. At least, there are five figures. Mum looks pregnant and Dad looks like a gnome. I have a head the size of a pin and twenty very large circular fingers. But, you know, apart from that it\u2019s pretty accurate.</p><p>\u201c \u2018Fill in the box with help from your family,\u2019 \u201d Mum reads. \u201c \u2018For example, \u201cWe love each other because we give each other cuddles.\u201d \u2019 \u201d She reaches for a pen. \u201cOK. What shall I put? Felix, what do you love about our family?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPizza,\u201d says Felix promptly.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t put pizza.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPizza!\u201d wails Felix. \u201cI love pizza!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t put, \u2018We love each other because of pizza.\u2019 \u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think that\u2019s a pretty good answer,\u201d says Dad, shrugging.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it,\u201d says Frank, grabbing the page, and we all look up in shock. Frank spoke! He takes a black Sharpie from his pocket and reads aloud as he writes:</p><p>\u201c \u2018We love each other because we respect each other\u2019s choices and understand when a person has a hobby that they love, and would never deliberately damage their property.\u2019 Oh, wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrank, you can\u2019t write that!\u201d says Mum sharply.</p><p>It\u2019s a bit late to say that, since he\u2019s already written it. In permanent ink.</p> <p>\u201cGreat!\u201d Mum glares at Frank. \u201cSo now you\u2019ve ruined your brother\u2019s homework sheet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve spoken the truth.\u201d Frank glowers back at her. \u201cYou can\u2019t handle the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA Few Good Men,\u201d says Dad promptly. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you\u2019d seen that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYouTube.\u201d Frank gets to his feet and heads over to the dishwasher.</p><p>\u201cWell, marvellous,\u201d says Mum, looking totally pissed off. \u201cNow we can\u2019t send this in. I\u2019ll have to write a note in his link book. \u2018Dear Mrs. Lacy, unfortunately Felix\u2019s homework was...\u2019 what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChewed by rats,\u201d I suggest.</p> <p>\u201c \u2018Inapplicable to the Turner family as they do not understand the concept of love beyond their own self-serving version,\u2019 \u201d comes Frank\u2019s sonorous voice from the sink.</p><p>As he slouches out of the kitchen, Mum and Dad exchange glances.</p><p>\u201cThat boy needs a hobby,\u201d mutters Mum. \u201cWe should never have let him give up the cello.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease not the cello again,\u201d says Dad, looking alarmed. \u201cI think he\u2019s beyond the cello.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying the cello!\u201d snaps Mum. \u201cBut something. What do teenagers do these days?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll sorts of things.\u201d Dad shrugs. \u201cWin Olympic medals, get into Harvard, create Internet companies, star in blockbuster films...\u201d As he trails off, he looks a bit depressed.</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t need to win a medal,\u201d says Mum firmly. \u201cHe just needs an interest. What about the guitar?\u201d Her face brightens. \u201cCan he still play that? Why don\u2019t you two jam together in the garage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe tried that once,\u201d says Dad, pulling a face. \u201cRemember? It wasn\u2019t a success...but we can try again!\u201d he amends quickly, at Mum\u2019s expression. \u201cGood idea! We\u2019ll have a bit of a jamming session. Father and son. We\u2019ll play some tracks, get in the beers\u2014I mean, not the beers,\u201d he adds hastily as Mum opens her mouth. \u201cNo beers.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd he should volunteer,\u201d says Mum with sudden determination. \u201cYes! That\u2019s what Frank can do. Volunteer.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m sitting in the kitchen later that evening, fiddling with the playback on my camera, when Frank shuffles in.</p><p>\u201cOh, hi.\u201d I raise my head, remembering something. \u201cListen, I haven\u2019t interviewed you yet. Can we do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to be interviewed.\u201d</p><p>Frank looks like he hates everyone and everything. His face is pale. His eyes are bloodshot. He looks less healthy than when he was gaming all the time.</p><p>\u201cOK.\u201d I shrug. I reach for a Dorito from the bowl still sitting on the table. We had Tex-Mex for supper tonight, which is the only time Mum buys crisps. It\u2019s like, if they\u2019re Doritos and scooping up guacamole then they don\u2019t count as junk food. \u201cSo...\u201d I try to speak casually. \u201cI was wondering...\u201d</p><p>My voice is letting me down. It doesn\u2019t sound casual, it sounds over-alert. On the other hand, I don\u2019t think Frank is in a noticing mood.</p><p>\u201cIs Linus coming over?\u201d It comes out in a hurry and I sound the opposite of casual, but there you go. I\u2019ve asked.</p><p>Frank turns his head to give me a murderous glare.</p><p>\u201cWhy would Linus come over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...because...\u201d I\u2019m confused. \u201cHave you had a fight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I haven\u2019t had a fight.\u201d His eyes are so bleak and full of anger, I flinch. \u201cI\u2019ve been dropped from the team.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDropped from the team?\u201d I stare at him in shock. \u201cBut it was your team.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I can hardly play now, can I?\u201d</p><p>His voice is all muffled and low. I have a horrible feeling he wants to cry. I haven\u2019t seen Frank cry since he was about ten. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFrank.\u201d I feel a huge wave of sorrow for him. In fact, I think I might cry for him instead. \u201cHave you told Mum?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTold Mum?\u201d he lashes out. \u201cWhat, so she can stand there and cheer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wouldn\u2019t!\u201d I say. But actually I\u2019m not sure.</p><p>The thing about Mum is, she doesn\u2019t know what she\u2019s talking about. I don\u2019t mean that in a bad way. It\u2019s just, no adults do. They\u2019re totally ignorant, but they\u2019re in control. It\u2019s nuts. The parents are in charge of all the stuff like technology in the house and time on screens and hours on social media, but then their computer goes wrong and they\u2019re like a baby, going, \u201cWhat happened to my document?\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t get Facebook.\u201d \u201cHow do I load a picture? Double-click what? What does that mean?\u201d</p> <p>And we have to sort it out for them.</p><p>So Mum probably would cheer if she heard Frank wasn\u2019t on the team anymore. And then in the next breath she\u2019d say, \u201cDarling, why don\u2019t you take up a hobby and join a team?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry, Frank,\u201d I say, but he doesn\u2019t react. The next minute he\u2019s shuffled out of the kitchen and I\u2019m left alone with the Doritos.</p><p>\u201cSo things haven\u2019t been good.\u201d Dr. Sarah sounds as unruffled as ever.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re OK. But everyone\u2019s stressy. I\u2019ve been in bed a lot. It\u2019s like, I\u2019m so tired all the time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re tired, just rest. Don\u2019t fight it. Your body\u2019s mending itself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I sigh, my legs hunched up on the chair. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to be tired. I don\u2019t want to be overwhelmed. I want to kick this.\u201d</p><p>The words come out before I\u2019ve thought them, and I feel a sudden little jab of adrenaline.</p><p>When I say things to Dr. Sarah, it\u2019s as if I\u2019m hearing them for the first time and suddenly they become real. She\u2019s a bit magic, I think. She\u2019s like a fortune-teller\u2014only in the present, not the future. Things change in her room. I don\u2019t know how, they just do.</p><p>\u201cGood!\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s good. But, Audrey, what you don\u2019t seem to realize is, you are kicking it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo I\u2019m not.\u201d I look at her resentfully. How can she say that?</p> <p>\u201cYou are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been in bed for, like, the last three days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo-one said getting better would be a straightforward journey. Remember our graph?\u201d</p><p>She gets up and heads for her whiteboard. She draws two axes and a jagged red line heading up.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll go up and you\u2019ll go down. But your progress will be in the right direction. It is in the right direction. You\u2019ve come a long way, Audrey. Remember our first meeting?\u201d</p><p>I shrug. Some of our sessions are a bit of a blur, to be honest.</p><p>\u201cWell, I do. And believe me, I\u2019m pleased with what I see before me today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I feel a tiny glow of pride, which is pathetic. I mean, I didn\u2019t do anything.</p> <p>\u201cHow\u2019s the film going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s OK.\u201d I nod.</p><p>\u201cHave you interviewed anyone from out of the house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d I hesitate. \u201cNot yet. Not exactly.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Sarah waits. This is what she does, like a cop waiting to catch out a criminal. And every time I say I won\u2019t crack first, but I always do.</p><p>\u201cOK, there\u2019s this boy, Linus,\u201d I hear myself saying.</p><p>\u201cYes, you\u2019ve mentioned him.\u201d She nods.</p><p>\u201cHe used to come round to see Frank and I was going to interview him. Only now he doesn\u2019t come round anymore. So I thought...I mean...\u201d</p><p>I trail off, not sure what I do mean.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should ask him,\u201d says Dr. Sarah, like it\u2019s no big deal.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d I say automatically.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause...\u201d I lapse into silence. She knows why not. It doesn\u2019t need saying.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s visualize the worst that can happen,\u201d says Dr. Sarah cheerfully. \u201cYou ask Linus to come over and he says no. How does that make you feel?\u201d</p><p>Trickles of anxiety are running down my back. I don\u2019t like this conversation anymore. I should never have mentioned Linus.</p><p>\u201cHow does that make you feel?\u201d persists Dr. Sarah. \u201cAudrey, work with me. Linus has just said, \u2018No, I won\u2019t come over.\u2019 What are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m totally embarrassed,\u201d I say miserably. \u201cI\u2019m dying. I\u2019m like, oh my God. Like, I\u2019m so stupid...\u201d I screw up my face in agony. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy stupid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause\u2014 Because!\u201d I look at her almost angrily.

All that means is, he didn\u2019t feel like being interviewed, or he was busy, or he\u2019s intending to say yes another time. Or any number of things. It doesn\u2019t mean anything about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it does!\u201d I say before I can stop myself.</p><p>\u201cOf course?\u201d She instantly picks me up on it. \u201cOf course?\u201d</p> <p>OK, I fell into that one. Of course is the kind of phrase that makes Dr. Sarah\u2019s nose twitch like a shark scenting blood. That and I have to.</p><p>\u201cAudrey, do you know what Linus is thinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say reluctantly.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t sound sure about that.

I was mind-reading.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were mind-reading.\u201d She nods. \u201cYou have no idea what Linus is thinking. It could be good, it could be bad. Most likely, it\u2019s nothing at all. He\u2019s a boy. You\u2019d better get used to that.\u201d Her face crinkles in humour.</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d I know she\u2019s trying to make me smile, but I\u2019m too confused. \u201cSo...I should ask him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you should.\u201d She picks up the whiteboard cloth and rubs out Linus won\u2019t come over. In its place, she writes:</p><p>\u201cOK?\u201d she says, when I\u2019ve had a chance to read it.</p><p>\u201cOK.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Then ask him. Let\u2019s make that your homework. Asking Linus.\u201d</p><p>The first step is catching Mum in a good mood, when she\u2019s not going to freak out or overreact or anything. I wait till she\u2019s just finished watching an episode of MasterChef, then casually sit on the arm of the sofa and say,</p> <p>\u201cMum, I\u2019d like a phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA phone?\u201d She sits up, her eyes wide circles, her mouth open. \u201cA phone?\u201d</p><p>If I\u2019m the Queen of Overreaction, Mum is the Empress.</p><p>\u201cUm, yes. A phone. If that\u2019s OK.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are you going to call?\u201d she demands.</p><p>\u201cI just...I don\u2019t know. People.\u201d I know I sound scratchy, but she makes me scratchy.</p><p>\u201cWhich people?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople! Do you, like, need all their names?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s silence, and I know what she\u2019s thinking, because I\u2019m thinking it too. My last phone wasn\u2019t exactly a success. I mean, it was a nice phone. It was a Samsung. But it became like this portal. A kind of toxic portal to...all of it. It used to make me quiver with fright, just hearing the buzz of a text, let alone reading it. I don\u2019t know what happened to it. Dad got rid of it.</p><p>But I mean, that was then.</p><p>That was them.</p><p>\u201cAudrey...\u201d Mum\u2019s face is strained and I feel sorry I\u2019ve ruined her nice evening of Master Chef and Grand Designs or whatever.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be fine,\u201d I reassure her.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to call Natalie? Is that it?\u201d</p><p>The name Natalie makes me shrink away a little. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m quite ready to talk to Natalie. But nor do I want to give anything away to Mum.</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d I shrug.</p><p>\u201cAudrey, I don\u2019t know...\u201d</p><p>I know why Mum\u2019s sensitive on this issue. I mean believe me, I\u2019m sensitive too. (In fact, I\u2019m oversensitive, which basically the whole world has told me.) But I\u2019m not giving in. I feel resolved on this. I should get a phone.</p><p>\u201cAudrey, be careful. I just...I just don\u2019t want you to be...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>I can see a few grey hairs among Mum\u2019s vivid brown highlights. Her skin looks kind of thin. I think all this has aged her. I\u2019ve aged her.</p><p>\u201cDr. Sarah would tell me to get the phone,\u201d I say, to make her feel better. \u201cShe always says I can text her, any time. She says I\u2019ll know when I\u2019m ready. Well, I\u2019m ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK.\u201d Mum sighs. \u201cWe\u2019ll get you a phone. I mean, it\u2019s great that you want one, darling. It\u2019s wonderful.\u201d She puts a hand on mine as though she\u2019s only just seeing the positive side. \u201cThis is progress!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI haven\u2019t used it yet,\u201d I remind her. \u201cDon\u2019t get too excited.\u201d I sit properly on the sofa and shift up a bit. \u201cWhat are you watching?\u201d</p><p>As I\u2019m moving the cushions around, I see a book, nestled in Mum\u2019s lap. It\u2019s entitled How to Talk to Your Teens by Dr. Terence Kirshenberger.</p><p>\u201cOh my God.\u201d I pick it up. \u201cMum, what is this?\u201d</p><p>Mum flushes pink and grabs it.</p> <p>\u201cNothing. Just some reading matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need a book to talk to us!\u201d I flip through the pages and see lots of lame-looking cartoons, then turn to the back. \u201cTwelve ninety-five?

Poor Mum. I can\u2019t believe she spent \u00a312.95 on a book full of crap cartoons.</p><p>She read it! She read the \u00a312.95 book!</p> <p>The reason I know is that on Saturday she suddenly starts talking to Frank at breakfast like she\u2019s speaking a foreign language.</p><p>\u201cSo, Frank, I noticed you left two wet towels on the floor of your bedroom yesterday,\u201d she begins, in weird, calm tones. \u201cThat made me feel surprised. How did it make you feel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Frank stares at her.</p><p>\u201cI think we could find a solution to the towel issue together,\u201d Mum continues. \u201cI think that could be a fun challenge.\u201d</p><p>Frank looks at me, baffled, and I shrug.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think, Frank?\u201d persists Mum. \u201cIf you were running this house, what would you advise about towels?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDunno.\u201d Frank looks a bit unnerved. \u201cUse kitchen towel and chuck it away.\u201d</p><p>I can tell Mum is a bit frustrated with that answer, but she keeps on smiling this weird smile.</p><p>\u201cI hear you,\u201d she says. \u201cInteresting idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not.\u201d Frank looks at her suspiciously.</p><p>\u201cYes it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMum, it\u2019s a stupid idea I invented to piss you off. You can\u2019t say \u2018It\u2019s interesting.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cI hear you.\u201d Mum nods. \u201cI hear you, Frank. I can see your point of view. It\u2019s valid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a point of view!\u201d Frank snaps. \u201cAnd stop saying \u2018I hear you.\u2019 \u201d</p> <p>\u201cMum read a book,\u201d I tell him. \u201cIt\u2019s called How to Talk to Your Teens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh for fuck\u2019s sake.\u201d Frank rolls his eyes.</p><p>\u201cDo not swear, young man!\u201d Mum snaps straight out of her Stepford Mum mode.</p><p>\u201cOh, for futtsake!\u201d chimes in Felix joyfully, and Mum inhales furiously.</p><p>\u201cYou see? You see what you did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, stop talking to me like a bloody robot!\u201d shouts Frank. \u201cIt\u2019s totally fake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBloody robot!\u201d echoes Felix.</p><p>\u201cThat book cost twelve ninety-five,\u201d I tell Frank, who gives an incredulous laugh.</p><p>\u201cTwelve ninety-five! I could write that book in four words. It would say \u2018Stop patronizing your teenager.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>There\u2019s silence. I think Mum\u2019s making an effort not to lose it. From the way she\u2019s crushing her napkin into a tiny ball, I think she\u2019s finding it quite hard. At last she looks up with a smile again.</p><p>\u201cFrank, I understand you\u2019re frustrated with life at the moment,\u201d she says, in pleasant tones. \u201cSo I\u2019ve found you some occupations. You can do some jamming with Dad today and next week you\u2019re volunteering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVolunteering?\u201d Frank looks taken aback. \u201cLike, building huts in Africa?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaking sandwiches for the Avonlea fete.\u201d</p><p>Avonlea is the old people\u2019s home in the next street. They have this fete every year and it\u2019s quite fun. You know. For a thing in a garden with old people.</p><p>\u201cMaking sandwiches?\u201d Frank looks aghast. \u201cYou\u2019re joking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve volunteered our kitchen for the catering. We\u2019re all going to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not making bloody sandwiches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hear you,\u201d says Mum. \u201cBut you are. And don\u2019t swear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hear you, Frank,\u201d says Mum implacably. \u201cBut you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMum stop it, OK?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hear you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hear you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it! Jesus!\u201d Frank brings two fists to his head. \u201cOK, I\u2019ll make the bloody sandwiches! Now have you finished ruining my life?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He swings away from the table and Mum gives a tiny smile.</p><p>MY SERENE AND LOVING FAMILY\u2014FILM TRANSCRIPT</p><p>INTERIOR. 5 ROSEWOOD CLOSE.

What stuff?</p><p>FRANK</p><p>OK, you want to know? (He counts off on his fingers.) Minecraft\u2014architecture. SimCity\u2014how to manage a population and budget and shit. Assassin\u2019s Creed\u2014ancient Rome and the Borgias and like...Leonardo da Vinci. Everything. All the history I remember comes from Assassin\u2019s Creed. None from school.

So instead I text.</p><p>Hi, Linus. This is Audrey here. Frank\u2019s sister. I still need to do my documentary and you said you would be interviewed for it. Is that still OK? Could we meet? Thanks, Audrey.</p><p>And I\u2019m expecting no reply, or at least a long wait, but the phone buzzes straight away and there\u2019s his response:</p><p>Sure. When?</p> <p>I hadn\u2019t thought about that. When? It\u2019s Saturday evening, which means we\u2019ve got all day tomorrow.</p><p>Tomorrow? Do you want to come round here? 11 a.m.?</p><p>I press Send, and this time there\u2019s a bit of a wait before he replies:</p><p>No, let\u2019s meet at Starbucks.</p><p>A jolt of panic goes through me like white fire.

Isn\u2019t that your project?</p><p>But...but...but...</p><p>Starbucks?</p><p>Tomorrow?</p><p>My fingers are trembling. My skin feels hot. I\u2019m breathing in for four counts and out for seven and trying to channel Dr. Sarah. How would she advise me? What would she say?</p><p>But already I know what she\u2019d say. Because she\u2019s said it.

See you there.</p><p>I know what it\u2019s like to be an old person now.</p><p>OK, I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to have wrinkly skin and white hair. But I do know what it\u2019s like to walk down the road at a slow, uncertain pace, wincing at the passing of people, and flinching when horns beep and feeling like everything is just too fast.</p> <p>Mum and Dad have taken Felix out for the day to some garden show, and at the last minute they took Frank too to \u201cbroaden his horizons.\u201d So they have no idea I\u2019m doing this. I couldn\u2019t face the whole big deal of telling them and Mum fussing and all that palaver. So I waited till they left, got my key, got my money and the camera, and just left the house.</p><p>Which I haven\u2019t done for...</p><p>I don\u2019t know. So long.</p><p>We live about twenty minutes\u2019 walk from Starbucks, if you\u2019re striding. I\u2019m not striding. But I\u2019m not stopping either. I\u2019m going. Even though my lizard brain is poised to curl up in fright, I\u2019m managing to put one foot in front of the other. Left, right. Left, right.</p><p>My dark glasses are on, my hands are jammed in the pockets of my hoodie, and I\u2019ve pulled the hood up for extra protection. I haven\u2019t raised my gaze from the pavement but that\u2019s OK. Most people walk along in their own worlds anyway.</p><p>As I reach the town centre the crowds become denser and the shop fronts are bright and noisy and with every step I have a stronger desire to run, but I don\u2019t. I push on. It\u2019s like climbing a mountain, I tell myself. Your body doesn\u2019t want to do it, but you make it.</p><p>And then, at last, I\u2019ve made it to Starbucks. As I approach the familiar fa\u00e7ade I feel kind of exhausted, but I\u2019m giddy too. I\u2019m here. I\u2019m here!</p><p>I push the door open and there\u2019s Linus, sitting at a table near the entrance. He\u2019s wearing jeans and a grey T-shirt and he looks hot, I notice before I can stop myself. Not that this is a date.</p><p>I mean, obviously it\u2019s not a date. But even so\u2014</p><p>Midsentence Stop. Whatever. You know what I mean.</p><p>Linus\u2019s face brightens as he sees me, and he leaps up from the table.</p><p>\u201cYou made it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think you would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think so either,\u201d I admit.</p><p>\u201cBut you did! You\u2019re cured!\u201d</p><p>His enthusiasm is so infectious I grin madly back and we sort of do a mini-dance, arms waving up and down.</p><p>\u201cShall we get some coffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d I say, in my new confident, everything\u2019s-fine way. \u201cGreat!\u201d</p><p>As we join the queue I feel kind of wired. The music on the sound system is too loud and the conversations around me are hitting my eardrums with a force that makes me wince, but I\u2019m going with it instead of resisting. Like you do at a rock concert, when your nerves get taken over by the force of the noise and you just have to surrender. (And yes, I appreciate most people would not equate low-level Starbucks chatter to a rock concert. All I will say is: Try living inside my brain for a bit.)</p><p>I can feel my heart pumping, but whether it\u2019s because of the noise or the people or because I\u2019m with a hot-looking boy, I don\u2019t know. I give my order (caramel Frappuccino) and the surly girl behind the counter says, \u201cName?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>If there\u2019s one thing I don\u2019t want it\u2019s my name being shouted across a busy coffee shop.</p><p>\u201cI hate the name thing,\u201d I mutter to Linus.</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d He nods. \u201cGive a fake one.

Um, Rhubarb,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cRhubarb?\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s easy to keep a poker face when you\u2019re wearing dark glasses and a hoodie and you\u2019re looking off to one side.</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s my name. Rhubarb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re called Rhubarb?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course she\u2019s called Rhubarb,\u201d chimes in Linus. \u201cHey, Rhu, do you want anything to eat? You want a muffin, Rhu?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks.\u201d I can\u2019t help smiling.</p><p>\u201cOK, Rhu. No problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Rhu-barb.\u201d The girl writes it down with her Sharpie. \u201cAnd you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would like a cappuccino,\u201d says Linus politely. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour name?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll spell it for you,\u201d he says. \u201cZ-W-P-A-E-N\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She stares at him, Sharpie in hand</p><p>\u201cWait. I haven\u2019t finished. Double-F-hyphen-T-J-U-S. It\u2019s an unusual name,\u201d Linus adds gravely. \u201cIt\u2019s Dutch.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m shaking, trying not to laugh. The Starbucks girl gives us both evil stares.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re John,\u201d she says, and scrawls it on his cup.</p><p>I tell Linus I\u2019ll pay because this is my documentary and I\u2019m the producer, and he says OK, he\u2019ll get the next one. Then we take our cups\u2014Rhubarb and John\u2014and head back to our table. My heart is pounding even harder, but I\u2019m on a high. Look at me! In Starbucks! Back to normal!</p><p>I mean, OK, I\u2019m still in dark glasses. And I can\u2019t look at anyone. And my hands are doing weird twisty things in my lap. But I\u2019m here. That\u2019s the point.</p><p>\u201cSo you dumped Frank off your team,\u201d I say as we sit down, and immediately regret it in case it sounds aggressive.</p> <p>But Linus doesn\u2019t look offended. He looks worried. \u201cFrank doesn\u2019t blame me,\u201d he says quickly, and I realize they must have had a conversation about this. \u201cI mean, he wouldn\u2019t expect us all to give up playing LOC just because he\u2019s had to. He said he\u2019d do the same if it was him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo who\u2019s the fourth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis guy Matt,\u201d says Linus without enthusiasm. \u201cHe\u2019s OK.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad made Frank play bass with him in the garage,\u201d I tell him. \u201cHe thinks that\u2019s a better interest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes Frank play bass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBarely.\u201d I snuffle with laughter. \u201cHe plays, like, three chords and Dad does ten-minute solos.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think that\u2019s bad? My dad plays the recorder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe what?\u201d My laughter dies away. \u201cSeriously?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t tell anyone.\u201d Linus looks suddenly vulnerable and I feel a wave of...something. Something strong and warm. Like when you put your arm round someone and squeeze.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t tell. I promise.\u201d I take a sip of Frappuccino. \u201cLike, the kind of recorder kids play?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA grown-up kind. Wooden. Big.\u201d He demonstrates.</p><p>\u201cWow. I didn\u2019t know that existed.\u201d</p><p>We sip our drinks and smile at each other. Thoughts are racing through my head, crazy thoughts like I\u2019ve made it! I\u2019m in Starbucks! Go me! But there are other, weird, random thoughts popping up, like Everyone\u2019s looking at me and I hate myself. And then suddenly I wish I was at home right now, which is just weird. I do not wish I was at home. I\u2019m out with Linus! In Starbucks!</p><p>\u201cSo what do you want to ask me on your documentary?\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know. Stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this part of your therapy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Kind of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut do you still need therapy? I mean, you look fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I am fine. It\u2019s just this project...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you just took off your dark glasses you\u2019d be, like, totally back to normal. You should do that,\u201d Linus says with enthusiasm. \u201cYou know, just do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you shouldn\u2019t wait. You should do it, right here, right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Maybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShall I do it?\u201d He reaches over and I recoil.</p><p>My bravado is melting away. His voice feels hectoring, like he\u2019s giving me an interrogation.</p><p>I don\u2019t know what\u2019s happened in my head. Things have turned. I take a sip of Frappuccino, trying to relax, but all I really want to do is grab a napkin and shred it into little bits. The voices around me are getting louder and louder; more and more threatening. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>At the counter, someone\u2019s complaining about a cold coffee, and I find myself tuning in to the only side of the argument that I can hear.</p><p>\u201cComplained three times\u2014 Don\u2019t want a free coffee\u2014Not good enough!

What\u2019s the point of me, anyway?</p> <p>\u201cAudrey?\u201d Linus waves a hand in front of my face, which makes me flinch even more. \u201cAudrey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I gulp, and push my chair back. I have to escape.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Linus stares at me, bewildered.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just...too loud. Too much.\u201d I put my hands over my ears. \u201cSorry. I\u2019m so sorry...\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m already at the door. I push it open and feel some small relief as I make it outside. But I\u2019m not safe. I\u2019m not home.</p><p>\u201cBut you were fine.\u201d Linus has followed me out. He sounds almost angry. \u201cYou were fine just now! We were chatting and we were laughing...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d I say desperately. \u201cI don\u2019t know. It makes no sense.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo, just tell yourself to snap out of it. You know, mind over matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve tried!\u201d Angry tears rise in my eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t you think I\u2019ve tried snapping out of it?\u201d</p><p>My head is a whirling mass of distress signals. I have to go. Now. I never hail taxis, ever, but right now I don\u2019t even think twice. I stick my hand out and a black cab comes trundling by. Tears are filling my eyes as I get in\u2014not that anyone can see them.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I say to Linus, my voice a little thick. \u201cI really am. So. We should forget the film and everything. So. I won\u2019t see you, I guess. Bye. Sorry. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>At home I lie in my bed, totally still, totally silent, with the curtains drawn and earplugs in. For about three hours. I don\u2019t move a muscle. Sometimes I feel as if I\u2019m a phone, and this is the only way I can recharge. Dr. Sarah says my body is on an adrenaline roller coaster, and that\u2019s why I lurch from totally wired to totally fatigued, with nothing in between.</p><p>At last, feeling wobbly, I head downstairs for something to eat. I write a text to Dr. Sarah:</p><p>I went to Starbucks but I had a meltdown,</p><p>and send it off. The dark, ill thoughts have gone, but they\u2019ve left me feeling weak and jittery.</p> <p>I drift into the kitchen, and wince as I pass my reflection in the mirror. I look pale and kind of...I don\u2019t know. Shrunken. It\u2019s like the flu. It attacks you and your whole body takes the hit. I\u2019m just considering whether to make a Nutella sandwich or a cheese one when I hear a rattling sound from the hall, and something dropping on the mat, and I jump a mile.</p><p>For a moment there\u2019s silence. I\u2019ve tensed up all over like an animal in a trap, but I tell myself firmly, I am safe, I am safe, I am safe, and my heart rate slowly drops, and at last I wander out to see what it is.</p><p>It\u2019s a note, on the doormat\u2014a piece of lined paper torn out of a notebook with Audrey written in Linus\u2019s handwriting. I open it to see:</p><p>Are you OK? I texted but you didn\u2019t reply. Frank didn\u2019t reply either. I didn\u2019t want to ring the doorbell and shock you.</p><p>I haven\u2019t even looked at my phone since I texted Dr. Sarah. And Frank\u2019s at the garden show, in the countryside. He probably hasn\u2019t got any signal. I imagine Frank, grimly tramping round some field, and raise a faint smile. He\u2019ll be in such a bad mood.</p><p>Through the ripply glass of the front door I suddenly notice a kind of shadowy movement, and my heart catches. Oh God. Is that Linus, there? Is he waiting? For what?</p><p>I reach for a pen and think for a moment.</p><p>I\u2019m fine, thank you, sorry I freaked out.</p><p>I push it back through the letter box. It\u2019s a bit difficult because there\u2019s a spring, but I manage it. A moment later, it reappears.</p><p>You looked really bad. I was worried.</p><p>I stare at his words, my heart falling like a stone. Really bad. I looked really bad. I ruin everything.</p><p>Sorry.</p><p>Somehow I can\u2019t find anything to put except that one word, so I write it again.</p><p>Sorry. Sorry.</p><p>And I post the letter back through the letter box. Almost at once the page is pushed back with his reply: </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>No, don\u2019t be sorry. It\u2019s not your fault. In Starbucks, what were you thinking?</p><p>I wasn\u2019t expecting that. For a few moments I don\u2019t move. I\u2019m hunched on the doormat, thoughts running through my head like ticker tape. Do I answer? What do I answer?</p><p>Do I want to tell him what I was thinking?</p><p>The voice of that therapist from St. John\u2019s keeps running through my head; the one who used to take the Self-Assertion workshop. We do not have to reveal ourselves. She used to say it every week. We are all entitled to privacy. You do not have to share anything with others, however much they may ask you. Photos, fantasies, plans for the weekend...they\u2019re yours. She used to look around the room almost sternly. You do NOT have to share them.</p> <p>I don\u2019t have to share with Linus what I was thinking. I could walk away. I could write, Oh, nothing! Or, You don\u2019t want to know!!!;) Like it\u2019s all a big joke.</p><p>But somehow...I want to share. I don\u2019t know why, but I do. I trust him. And he\u2019s on the other side of the door. It\u2019s all safe. Like in a confessional.</p><p>Before I can change my mind, I scrawl,</p><p>I was thinking, \u201cI\u2019m a total failure, I shouldn\u2019t exist, what\u2019s the point of me?\u201d</p><p>I shove it through the letter box, sit back on my heels, and blow out, feeling a strange satisfaction. There. Enough pretending. Now he knows just how weird the inside of my mind is. I hold my breath, trying to glean his reaction on the other side of the door, but there\u2019s silence. The ripply glass is still. I can\u2019t detect any response at all. I think he must have gone. Of course he\u2019s gone. Who would stay?</p> <p>Oh God, am I nuts? Why would I write down my most warped thoughts and post them through a letter box to the one guy I actually like? Why would I do this?</p><p>Totally deflated, I get to my feet, and I\u2019ve reached the kitchen door when I hear a rattling. I whip round\u2014and there\u2019s a reply on the doormat. My hands are trembling as I grab it, and at first I can\u2019t focus properly. It\u2019s a new page, covered in writing, and it begins,</p><p>What\u2019s the point of you? Try this, for starters.</p><p>And underneath there\u2019s a long list. He\u2019s written a long, long list, that fills the page. I\u2019m so flustered, I can\u2019t even read it properly, but as I scan down I catch beautiful smile and great taste in music (I sneaked a look at your iPod) and awesome Starbucks name.</p><p>I give a sudden snort of laughter that almost turns to a sob and then turns to a smile, and then suddenly I\u2019m wiping my eyes. I\u2019m all over the place.</p><p>With a rattle, another note plops through the letter box and I jerk in shock. What more can he have to say? Not another great big list, surely? But it says:</p> <p>Will you open the door?</p><p>A flurry of alarm races through me. I can\u2019t let him see my shrunken, pale, ratty self. I just can\u2019t. I know Dr. Sarah would tell me I\u2019m not shrunken or ratty, I\u2019m imagining it, but she\u2019s not here, is she?</p><p>Not quite up to it. Another time. Sorry, sorry...</p><p>I hold my breath after I\u2019ve posted the page. He\u2019ll be offended. He\u2019ll leave. That\u2019s it, all over, before it even began...</p><p>But then the letter box rattles yet again and a reply comes through:</p><p>Understood. I\u2019ll be off, then.</p><p>My spirits plunge. He is leaving. He is offended. He hates me, I should have opened the door, I should have been stronger, I\u2019m so stupid...I\u2019m just trying desperately to think of what I can write, when another page drops onto the mat. It\u2019s folded over, and on the outside is written:</p><p>Had to give you this before I go.</p> <p>For a few moments I don\u2019t dare read it. But at last I open it up and stare at the words inside. My head is prickling all over with disbelief. My breath is jumpy as I read it. He wrote that. He wrote that. To me.</p><p>It\u2019s a kiss.</p><p>At St. John\u2019s, they tell you not to keep rewinding your thoughts and going over old ground. They tell you to live in the present, not the past. But how are you supposed to do that when a boy you like has just kind of, virtually, kissed you?</p><p>By the time I see Dr. Sarah at my next session I\u2019ve replayed the scene like a million times, and now I\u2019m wondering if the whole thing was just him winding me up, or having something to laugh about with his friends, or was he just being polite? I mean, does he feel sorry for me? Was it a pity kiss? Oh God. It was so a pity kiss. (Not that I\u2019m an expert on kisses. I have kissed precisely one boy in my life, which was on holiday last year and it was gross.)</p><p>Dr. Sarah listens politely for about half an hour as I blabber on about Linus. And then we talk about \u201cmind-reading\u201d and \u201ccatastrophising,\u201d just like I knew we would. I think I could be a therapist myself, sometimes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI know what you\u2019ll tell me,\u201d I say at last. \u201cI can\u2019t read his mind and I shouldn\u2019t try. But how can I not think about it? He kissed me. I mean...sort of. On paper.\u201d I shrug, feeling a bit embarrassed. \u201cYou probably think it doesn\u2019t count.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d says Dr. Sarah seriously. \u201cThe fact that it was on paper doesn\u2019t lessen it. A kiss is a kiss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now I haven\u2019t heard from him and I have no idea what he\u2019s thinking, and it stresses me out...\u201d Dr. Sarah doesn\u2019t reply immediately, and I sigh. \u201cI know, I know. I have an illness and it\u2019s fully treatable.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s another long silence. Dr. Sarah\u2019s mouth is twitching.</p> <p>\u201cYou know, Audrey?\u201d she says at last. \u201cI hate to break it to you, but getting stressed over what boys are thinking after they\u2019ve kissed you may not be fully treatable. Not fully.\u201d</p><p>And then, three days after Starbucks, I\u2019m sitting watching TV peacefully on my own when Frank comes stomping into the den and says, \u201cLinus is here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right.\u201d I sit up in a fluster. \u201cReally? He\u2019s here? But...\u201d I swallow. \u201cYou\u2019re not allowed to play LOC, so...I mean, why is he...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wants to see you.\u201d Frank sounds fairly unimpressed by this fact. \u201cIs that OK? You won\u2019t freak out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Yes. I mean...that\u2019s fine.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood, because he\u2019s here. Lin-us!\u201d</p><p>Some brothers would give their sister a chance to brush their hair. Or at least change out of the scaggy old T-shirt they\u2019ve been in all day. I\u2019m sending murderous thought waves to Frank as Linus comes into the den and says cautiously, \u201cHi. Wow, it\u2019s dark in here.\u201d</p><p>Everyone in the family has got so used to my darkened den, I forget how it must look to other people. I keep the blackout curtains closed and the lights off, and the only illumination is the flickering telly. And then I feel safe. Safe enough to take my dark glasses off.</p><p>\u201cYes. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine. You really are rhubarb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my name.\u201d I see him smile through the darkness. There\u2019s a glow on his teeth from the TV, and his eyes are two shining chinks.</p> <p>I\u2019m sitting in my customary place on the carpet and after a moment he comes over and sits down next to me. I mean, not right next to me. He\u2019s about a foot away. I think my skin must be able to send out signals like a bat, because I\u2019m totally aware of his position in relation to mine. And all the time my head is buzzing with the thought: He kissed me. On paper. Kind of. He kissed me.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you watching?\u201d He stares at the telly, where a woman in a tailored dress is trying to find things to say about kelp shampoo. \u201cIs that QVC?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I find the conversations soothing.\u201d</p><p>QVC is the most calming TV I know. You have three people in a studio and they all think the moisturiser is great. No-one argues the point or raises their voice. No-one discovers they\u2019re pregnant or gets murdered. And there\u2019s no studio laughter, which believe me, can sound like a drill in my head.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I know I\u2019m nuts,\u201d I add.</p><p>\u201cYou think this is nuts?\u201d says Linus. \u201cYou want to meet my granny. She\u2019s really nuts. She thinks she\u2019s twenty-five. When she looks in the mirror she thinks we\u2019re playing tricks on her. She can\u2019t see reality. She wears miniskirts, she wants to go out to dances...She wears more makeup than any granny you\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe sounds awesome!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s...you know.\u201d He shrugs. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s funny, sometimes it\u2019s sad. But the point is, she\u2019s not twenty-five, is she? It\u2019s just her sick brain telling her that, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p> <p>He seems to expect an answer, so I say, \u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI meant to say this to you, before. After Starbucks. Do you get what I\u2019m saying?\u201d He sounds emphatic. \u201cGran\u2019s not twenty-five, and you\u2019re not...whatever all that bad stuff in your head was telling you. You\u2019re not that.\u201d</p><p>And suddenly I see what he\u2019s doing, what he\u2019s trying to do.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I say again. \u201cYes. I know.\u201d</p><p>And I do know. Although it\u2019s easier to know when the bad thoughts aren\u2019t rushing through your head like a river.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I add. \u201cThanks for...you know. Understanding. Getting it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really get it. But...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do, more than most people. Really.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell.\u201d He sounds awkward. \u201cAnyway.

Then Linus says,</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s the shoe contact coming along?\u201d</p> <p>At the word contact I stiffen inside. Contact. Not just on paper, for real.</p><p>Don\u2019t think I haven\u2019t thought about it.</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t tried it again.\u201d I\u2019m trying hard to sound casual. \u201cDo you want to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK.\u201d</p><p>I shift my shoe over till it\u2019s touching his. Shoe to shoe, like we did before. I\u2019m poised for a meltdown, for a freakout, for some totally embarrassing reaction. But the strange thing is...it doesn\u2019t happen. My body hasn\u2019t squirmed away. My breathing is even. My lizard brain is, like, all Zen and relaxed. What\u2019s going on?</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s the darkness,\u201d I say out loud, before I can stop myself. \u201cIt\u2019s the darkness.\u201d I feel almost heady with relief.</p><p>\u201cWhat is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can relax when it\u2019s dark. It\u2019s like, the world is a different place.\u201d I spread my arms out in the dark, feeling it against my skin like a soft, enveloping cushion. \u201cI think I could do anything if the whole world was dark the whole time. You know. I\u2019d be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you should be a potholer,\u201d suggests Linus. \u201cOr a caver.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr a bat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA vampire.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh my God, I should so be a vampire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept the whole eating people thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYerk.\u201d I nod, agreeing.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t it get monotonous? People\u2019s blood every night? Don\u2019t they ever want a plate of chips?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I feel a giggle rise. \u201cNext time I see a vampire I\u2019ll ask him.\u201d</p><p>We watch the vegetable chopper make way for a steam cooker which has sold 145 units already, this hour.</p><p>\u201cSo, bearing in mind it\u2019s dark and all,\u201d says Linus, casually, \u201cwhat about...thumb contact? Just to see if you can do it. Like an experiment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d I nod, feeling a little flip in my stomach. \u201cUm. OK. Why not?\u201d</p> <p>I feel his hand make its way towards mine. Our thumbs find each other and his skin is dry and warm and kind of how I expected it to be. His thumbnail circles mine and I playfully dodge his, and he laughs.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re OK with thumb contact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThumb contact is good.\u201d I nod.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t say anything more, but I can feel him extending his thumb down into the palm of my hand. We\u2019re into finger-to-hand contact. And then palm-to-palm contact. His hand clasps mine and I squeeze back.</p><p>Now he\u2019s shifting closer and with more intent. I can feel the warmth of him, through the air, against my arm, against my leg. And now I\u2019m a little keyed up, but not like I was in Starbucks. There\u2019s nothing crazy running through my head. In fact, I\u2019m not sure anything\u2019s running through my head at all except Is this happening for real? And Yes it is.</p><p>\u201cJeans contact OK?\u201d he murmurs, as his leg twines round mine.</p><p>\u201cYes, jeans contact is good,\u201d I manage.</p><p>We\u2019ve reached arm-round-shoulders contact. Hair-to-hair contact. Cheek-to-cheek contact. His face feels gently rough as he slides it along mine.</p><p>Mouth contact.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t say anything about it or ask if it\u2019s OK. I don\u2019t say anything either. But it is OK. It\u2019s more than OK.</p><p>When we\u2019ve kissed, like, forever, he shuffles up and sits me on his knee, and I curl into him. He feels warm and solid. His arms feel strong around me. And his hair smells nice. And it\u2019s pretty hard to concentrate on the benefits of a food processor with four unique attachments, on special exclusive offer today for only \u00a369.99.</p><p>Here\u2019s the really embarrassing thing: I fell asleep. I don\u2019t know if it was a post-adrenaline crash or just the Clonazepam I\u2019d taken at lunchtime\u2014but I did. When I woke, I was spread-eagled on the floor and Mum was calling me from the hall, and the ladies on QVC were talking about a magic chip fryer that halves the calories. And next to me there was a note.</p><p>I\u2019ll see you soon. XXX</p><p>I\u2019ve gone up a level. That\u2019s the only way I can describe it.</p><p>If I was a hero in LOC I\u2019d have like enhanced attributes, or some extra kick-ass weapon or something. I\u2019m stronger. I feel taller. I bounce back quicker. It\u2019s been a week since Linus and I watched QVC and yes, I\u2019ve had one bad episode, but I didn\u2019t sink quite as low. Things weren\u2019t quite as dark. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Linus has come over a few times and we always watch QVC and just chat or whatever and it\u2019s just...Well.

From the kitchen window I watch Felix running round the lawn with no clothes on and a watering can in his fist.</p><p>I hear the tinkle of an ice-cream van and I\u2019m about to call out to Mum that we should get Felix an ice lolly, when she comes into the kitchen. Staggers, more like. Her face is so pale it\u2019s like mauve. And she actually holds on to the kitchen island as though otherwise she might fall over.</p><p>\u201cMum?\u201d I eye her in alarm. \u201cAre you OK?\u201d At once I realize this is a stupid question.

Have you got a temperature?\u201d I\u2019m trying to remember all the things she says to us when we\u2019re ill. \u201cWould you like a Lemsip?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, a Lemsip.\u201d She breathes out, looking like a wraith. \u201cYes, that would be nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll look after Felix,\u201d I say firmly. \u201cYou go to bed. I\u2019ll bring the Lemsip up.\u201d</p><p>I flip on the kettle and am rooting around in the cupboards for the Lemsip packet, when Frank arrives home. I can tell this from the almighty crash that comes from the hall. That\u2019ll be his school bag, a sports bag, his cricket bat, and whatever other junk he\u2019s got, all being dumped from a great height onto the tiles. He comes into the kitchen, singing some tuneless song and peeling off his tie.</p><p>\u201cAll right!\u201d He punches the air, singing, \u201cIt\u2019s the weeeeeek-end...What\u2019s for supper?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMum\u2019s ill,\u201d I tell him. \u201cShe\u2019s got, like, flu or something. I told her to go to bed. You should go out and buy her...\u201d I think for a moment. \u201cGrapes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve only just got home.\u201d Frank looks unenthusiastic. \u201cAnd I\u2019m starving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, have a sandwich and then get her some grapes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat good do grapes do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDunno,\u201d I say impatiently. \u201cIt\u2019s what you have when you\u2019re ill.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve made the Lemsip and found a couple of biscuits, and I put them all on a tray.</p> <p>\u201cGet Ribena too.\u201d I say. \u201cAnd whatsit. Nurofen. Write it down.\u201d I turn to make sure Frank is listening\u2014but he\u2019s not writing anything down. He\u2019s just standing there, giving me this weird, very un-Frank look. His head is tilted and he looks sort of fascinated, or curious, or something. \u201cWhat?\u201d I say defensively. \u201cLook, I know it\u2019s Friday, but Mum\u2019s ill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d says Frank. \u201cIt\u2019s not that. It\u2019s...\u201d He hesitates. \u201cD\u2019you know something, Aud? You wouldn\u2019t have done this when you first came back from hospital. You\u2019ve changed.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m so taken aback, I don\u2019t know what to say. Like, first of all, I didn\u2019t think Frank ever noticed things about me. And second of all, is that true? I try to think back, but it\u2019s a bit hazy. This is a side-effect of depression, Dr. Sarah has told me. Your memory gets shot to pieces. Which, you know, can be a good thing or a bad thing.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I say at last.</p><p>\u201cYou would have just hidden in your room. Everything got you into a state, even the doorbell ringing. But now look. You\u2019re in charge. You\u2019re on top of it.\u201d He nods at me holding the tray. \u201cIt\u2019s...well...It\u2019s good. It\u2019s cool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I say awkwardly.</p><p>\u201cNo probs.\u201d He looks equally awkward. Then he opens the fridge, gets out a carton of chocolate milk and plugs in his iPod buds. I guess this conversation is over.</p><p>But as I walk up the stairs with the tray, I\u2019m replaying it. You\u2019re in charge. You\u2019re on top of it. Just the thought gives me an inner glow. I haven\u2019t felt on top of anything for...forever.</p> <p>I tap on the door and go into my parents\u2019 room. Mum\u2019s lying in bed, her eyes closed. I think she\u2019s fallen asleep. She must have been exhausted.</p><p>I put the tray down as quietly as I can, on her dressing table. There\u2019s a bunch of framed photos on the polished wood, and I linger, looking at them all. Mum and Dad on their wedding day...me and Frank as babies...and one of Mum with all her workmates, winning some award. She\u2019s wearing a pink jacket and clutching a Perspex trophy and beaming, and she looks totally vibrant. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Mum is a freelance brand consultant, which means that she does projects all over the country. Sometimes she\u2019s really busy and sometimes she has weeks off, and that\u2019s how it\u2019s always been. She came to my school and talked about her job once, and showed us this supermarket logo redesign she\u2019d worked on, and everyone was really impressed. I mean, she\u2019s cool. Her job is cool. Only now I\u2019m looking at this photo I\u2019m wondering: When did she actually last work?</p><p>She was on a project when I got ill. I can vaguely remember hearing her talking to Dad about it, hearing her say, \u201cI\u2019m pulling out. I\u2019m not going to Manchester.\u201d All I felt then was relief. I didn\u2019t want her to go to Manchester. I didn\u2019t want her to go anywhere.</p><p>But now...</p><p>I look at the photo again, at Mum\u2019s happy, shiny photo face\u2014and then down at her tired, asleep, real-life face on the bed. It hadn\u2019t occurred to me that Mum had stopped working completely. But ever since I\u2019ve been at home, I realize, she hasn\u2019t gone to her office once.</p> <p>I feel like I\u2019m slowly coming out of a fog and noticing things I didn\u2019t before. What Dr. Sarah said is true: you get self-obsessed when you\u2019re ill. You can\u2019t see anything around you. But now I\u2019m starting to see stuff.</p><p>\u201cAudrey?\u201d</p><p>I turn to see that Mum is pushing herself up on her elbows.</p><p>\u201cHi!\u201d I say. \u201cI thought you were asleep. I brought you some Lemsip.\u201d</p><p>Mum\u2019s face cracks into a smile, as though I\u2019ve made her year.</p> <p>\u201cSweetheart,\u201d she says. \u201cThat is so kind.\u201d</p><p>I bring the tray and watch as she sips the hot drink. Her face is so distant that I think she might be falling asleep again, but suddenly she focuses on me.</p><p>\u201cAudrey,\u201d she says. \u201cThis Linus.\u201d</p><p>I feel my defenses rise at once. Not Linus. This Linus.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d I say, trying to sound casual.</p><p>\u201cIs he...?\u201d She trails off. \u201cAre you...? Is he a special friend?\u201d</p> <p>I can feel myself squirming inside. I don\u2019t want to talk about Linus to Mum.</p><p>\u201cKind of.\u201d I look away. \u201cYou always say I need to make friends. So. I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s great.\u201d Mum hesitates. \u201cBut, Audrey, you need to be careful. You\u2019re vulnerable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDr. Sarah says I need to push myself,\u201d I counter. \u201cI need to begin building relationships outside the family again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Mum looks troubled. \u201cBut I suppose I\u2019d rather you began with...Well. A girl friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause girls are so nice and sweet and lovely,\u201d I retort, before I can stop myself, and Mum sighs.</p><p>\u201cTouch\u00e9.\u201d She takes a sip of Lemsip, wincing. \u201cOh, I don\u2019t know. I suppose if this Linus is a nice boy...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s very nice,\u201d I say firmly. \u201cAnd his name isn\u2019t This Linus. It\u2019s Linus.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat about Natalie?\u201d</p><p>Natalie. A tiny part of me shrivels automatically at the name. But for the first time in ages, I can also feel a kind of longing. A longing for the friendship we had. For friendship, full stop.</p><p>There\u2019s quiet in the room as I try to pick through my muddled thoughts. Mum doesn\u2019t push me. She knows it sometimes takes me a long time to work out what I think. She\u2019s pretty patient.</p><p>I feel like I\u2019ve been on this massive long, lonely journey, and none of my friends could ever understand it, even Natalie. I think I kind of hated them for that. But now everything\u2019s feeling easier. Maybe I could see Natalie sometime? Maybe we could hang out? Maybe it wouldn\u2019t matter that she can\u2019t understand what I\u2019ve been through?</p><p>There\u2019s a photo on Mum\u2019s dressing table of Natalie and me dressed up for last year\u2019s Year 9 prom, and I find my eyes swiveling towards it. Nat\u2019s in a pink lacy dress and I\u2019m in blue. We\u2019re laughing and pulling party poppers. We did that picture about six times to get the party poppers just right. They were Nat\u2019s idea. She has funny ideas like that. I mean, she does make you laugh, Nat.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I will call Natalie,\u201d I say at last. \u201cSometime.\u201d I look at Mum for a reaction, but she\u2019s fallen asleep. The half-full Lemsip is tilting dangerously on the tray, and I grab it before it can spill. I leave it on her bedside table in case she wakes up, then tiptoe out of the room and head downstairs, full of a kind of new energy.</p><p>\u201cFrank,\u201d I demand as I enter the kitchen. \u201cHas Mum given up work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDunno.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she\u2019s really good at her job.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes, but she can\u2019t go out, can she?\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t say it, but I know what he means.

It is a tip of teenage stuff. Frank is sitting by the window, playing a game on a 1980s Atari console. Bleepy, tinny noises fill the room.</p><p>AUDREY (V.O.)</p><p>You could have looked up Uruguay on your phone.</p><p>FRANK</p> <p>Yeah.</p><p>AUDREY (V.O.)</p><p>So you\u2019re just messing with Dad.</p><p>FRANK</p><p>I need a computer.</p><p>The camera focuses on the Atari console.</p><p>AUDREY (V.O.)</p><p>Where did you find that?</p><p>FRANK</p><p>In the loft.</p><p>There\u2019s a knock at the door and, in one seamless motion, Frank throws a tracksuit over the Atari console, swivels his chair round, and picks up a book.</p><p>Mum comes in and looks around the room.</p><p>MUM</p><p>Frank, this room is a mess. You need to tidy it up.</p><p>Frank shrugs.</p><p>MUM</p><p>So what are you up to?</p><p>FRANK</p><p>Just...you know.</p><p>He glances at the camera.</p><p>FRANK</p><p>The usual.</p><p>I\u2019m doing it. I\u2019m getting better. Not just baby-steps better, massive-great-strides better. It\u2019s three weeks later and I\u2019m feeling more on top of it than ever. I\u2019ve been to Starbucks three times, Costa once, and The Ginger Biscuit once for milk shakes. I know! Dr. Sarah was like, \u201cAudrey, you are making strides!\u201d Then she told me not to go too fast too soon, yadda yadda, but you could tell she was impressed.</p><p>I\u2019ve even had lunch at a pizza restaurant! I had to leave before pudding because the restaurant suddenly got too clattery and threatening\u2014but still, I lasted a whole Quattro Staggioni. Mum and Dad came too, and Linus and Frank and Felix, and it felt like we were...you know. A normal group. Apart from the fact that one of us was sitting there in dark glasses like some sad, wannabe celeb. I said that to Mum and she said, \u201cYou think you\u2019re the abnormal-looking one? Look at Felix!\u201d</p><p>Which was a fair point, as Felix was dressed in his beloved new morph suit with a tiger mask on top of it, and had a tantrum when we pointed out that he wouldn\u2019t be able to eat any pizza like that.</p><p>So that made me feel better. In fact, a lot is making me feel better at the moment. Seeing Linus is definitely making me feel better. We text all the time and he comes over every day after school, and we\u2019ve started playing table tennis in the garden, like, obsessively. Even Frank joins in sometimes.</p><p>And today was amazing, because Linus gave me a present. A T-shirt. It has a picture of rhubarb on it and he got it off the Internet. Mum and Dad said \u201cWhy rhubarb?\u201d and he winked at me and said, \u201cIt\u2019s our thing.\u201d</p><p>Our thing.</p><p>I\u2019m not sure what makes me happier\u2014the T-shirt or the our thing. I\u2019ve never had an our thing with a boy before. Whichever it is, I\u2019m still glowing. Mum and Dad are out and Frank is doing homework and Felix is in bed and I feel fired up. I feel restless. I\u2019m wandering around the house in my T-shirt, feeling like I want to share all this. I want to talk to someone. I want to see someone</p><p>Natalie. I want to see Natalie.</p><p>The thought is like a light ray in my brain, so positive, it makes me blink. I want to see her. I want my friend back. Yes. I\u2019m going to do it. Right now.</p><p>I\u2019ve nearly phoned Nat a couple of times since I had that talk with Mum. Once I was actually halfway through dialling when I chickened out at the last moment. But today I can face it. I can more than face it.</p><p>I get out my phone and key in Natalie\u2019s number before I can change my mind. I know it off by heart, even though I haven\u2019t spoken to her for, like, a zillion years. The last time we saw each other was on that awful last day at school, and she was crying, and I was, like, beyond crying, and it wasn\u2019t the greatest goodbye.</p><p>I text:</p><p>Hi Nat. How are u? I\u2019m a lot better. Love to c u sometime. Auds. x</p><p>About thirty seconds later her reply arrives. It\u2019s like she\u2019s been sitting by her phone all this time, all these weeks, waiting.</p><p>Which maybe she has. I blink at the text, which goes like this:</p><p>OMG Auds. I have been SO WORRIED ABOUT U. Can I come round? Shall I come round now? Mum says it\u2019s fine. Nat xxxxx</p><p>I text back:</p><p>OK C u soon.</p><p>And what seems like five minutes later, the doorbell rings. It might have been ten minutes. It definitely wasn\u2019t any longer than that. She must have left the house that exact second. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I swing open the front door and step back, a bit unnerved. Not because I\u2019m not pleased to see Natalie, but because of all the stuff she\u2019s holding. She\u2019s got a gift basket of bath oil and a teddy bear holding a banner saying Get Well Soon and some books and magazines and bars of chocolate and a massive card.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I say faintly. \u201cWow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe wanted to visit you before,\u201d says Nat in a rush. \u201cBut your mum said...\u201d She swallows. \u201cAnyway.

It looks a bit mad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...come in.\u201d</p><p>As she edges in, she\u2019s eyeing up my dark glasses until I say, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople at school told me they\u2019d seen you in those.\u201d She points at my dark glasses. \u201cYou know, in the street. Even when it\u2019s raining. No-one knows why you wear them all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just...you know.\u201d I shrug awkwardly. \u201cBeing ill and everything.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She seems a bit freaked out. \u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>She comes in and dumps the stuff on the kitchen table and looks at me. For a moment there\u2019s a prickly, awkward silence, except the ticking of the clock, and I think Was this a mistake?</p><p>I\u2019m tense like a cat. I\u2019m wary. It\u2019s not the way I expected to be, but seeing Nat is bringing back all kinds of things I\u2019d put away in my mind.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Her voice comes out in a miserable gush. \u201cAuds, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m so sorry\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I shake my head, not wanting to go there. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I should\u2019ve\u2014 I didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d Tears are trickling down her face. \u201cI still can\u2019t believe it happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s OK. Look, have a drink.\u201d</p><p>I pour us both some elderflower. I should have realized she\u2019d be upset. In my head I\u2019ve skipped past all that. Or trudged through it, more like. Worked through it, is what Dr. Sarah would say. Processed it. Like I\u2019m a cheese slice machine.</p><p>I don\u2019t think Nat has processed an awful lot. Every time she looks at me, fresh tears pour down her face.</p><p>\u201cAnd now you\u2019re ill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. I\u2019m a lot better. I\u2019ve got a boyfriend!\u201d</p><p>OK, that sounded a bit abrupt, but let\u2019s face it\u2014this was the main purpose of inviting her over. To tell her I\u2019ve got a boyfriend. Immediately her tears vanish and she leans forward, avidly.</p><p>\u201cA boyfriend? From the hospital?\u201d</p><p>FFS. What does she think, that I\u2019m some mental case hanging out with another mental case because that\u2019s all I\u2019m fit for now?</p><p>\u201cNo, not from the hospital,\u201d I say impatiently. \u201cIt\u2019s Linus. You know? In Frank\u2019s year at Cardinal Nicholls?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLinus? You mean...Atticus Finch?\u201d Nat seems flabbergasted.</p> <p>\u201cExactly. He gave me this.\u201d I point at my T-shirt. \u201cToday. Isn\u2019t it cool?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that a picture of rhubarb?\u201d She looks confused.</p><p>\u201cYes. It\u2019s our thing,\u201d I say casually.</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d Nat seems unable to get over this news. \u201cSo...how long have you been going out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few weeks. We go to Starbucks and stuff. I mean, it\u2019s just...you know. Kind of fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were, like, properly ill. Like, in bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I was.\u201d I shrug. \u201cI suppose I\u2019m recovering or whatever.\u201d I rip open a bar of chocolate and break it into pieces. \u201cSo, tell me about school.\u201d</p><p>I force myself to ask it, even though the word school leaves a nasty sensation in my brain; a kind of poisonous imprint.</p><p>\u201cOh, everything\u2019s different now,\u201d says Natalie vaguely. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t believe it. Now that Tasha and that lot have left. Katie\u2019s totally changed. You wouldn\u2019t even know her. And Chloe isn\u2019t friends with Ruby anymore, and you know Miss Moore left? Well, we have a new deputy head now and she\u2019s brilliant\u2014\u201d Natalie breaks off from her jabbering. \u201cSo, are you going to come back?\u201d</p><p>The question hits me like a punch in the stomach. The idea of going back to that place literally makes me feel ill.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to the Heath Academy,\u201d I tell her. \u201cI\u2019m going to go down a year, because I\u2019ve missed so much school time. I mean, I\u2019m young for the year anyway, so it\u2019ll all work out...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could go down a year at Stokeland?\u201d suggests Nat, but I wrinkle my nose. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat would be weird. To be in the year below you. Anyway...\u201d I pause. \u201cThey hate us at Stokeland. My parents got really angry with them. They called this whole big governors\u2019 meeting and had a go at them and it all got...you know. Acrimonious.\u201d I know this from Frank, not from Mum and Dad. \u201cThey reckon the staff didn\u2019t handle things well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, they didn\u2019t!\u201d Nat opens her eyes wide. \u201cEveryone says that the whole time. Like, my parents go on about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell. So. Exactly. It\u2019d be weird to come back.\u201d</p><p>I break the chocolate into more pieces and offer them to Nat. She takes a piece, then looks up, a tear trickling down her face again. \u201cI miss you, Auds.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI miss you too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was really horrible when you\u2019d gone. Really horrible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a moment\u2019s pause\u2014then somehow, with no warning, we\u2019re hugging one other. Natalie smells of Herbal Essences, just like she always does, and she has this little thing of patting you in the small of your back which brings tears to my eyes, just because it\u2019s so familiar.</p><p>I\u2019ve missed hugging. God, I\u2019ve missed hugging.</p> <p>As we draw away from each other, we\u2019re both laughing but a bit teary too. Natalie\u2019s phone rings and she grabs it impatiently.</p><p>\u201cYes, Mum,\u201d she says shortly. \u201cEverything\u2019s fine. That\u2019s Mum,\u201d she explains as she throws her phone down again. \u201cShe\u2019s waiting outside in the car. I was supposed to text her every five minutes to say everything\u2019s OK.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause...you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know.\u201d Natalie wriggles awkwardly, looking past me.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAuds. You know. Because you\u2019re...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMentally unstable,\u201d says Natalie, practically in a whisper.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I stare at her, genuinely gobsmacked. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re bipolar.\u201d Natalie\u2019s cringing all over. \u201cBipolar people can become violent. Mum was just worried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not bipolar!\u201d I say in astonishment. \u201cWho told you I was bipolar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you?\u201d Natalie\u2019s jaw drops open. \u201cWell, Mum said you must be bipolar.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo I\u2019m going to attack you? Because I should never have been let out of my institution and should in fact be in a straitjacket? Jesus!\u201d I try to stay calm. \u201cI\u2019ve met bipolar people, Nat, and they were perfectly safe, believe it or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019m sorry!\u201d Natalie looks unhappy. \u201cBut we didn\u2019t know, did we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t my mum tell you what was wrong? Didn\u2019t she explain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...\u201d Natalie looks still more awkward. \u201cMy mum thought she was putting a gloss on it. I mean, there have been all these rumours\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what? What rumours?\u201d Natalie is silent, and I put on my most menacing tone. \u201cWhat rumours, Nat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK!\u201d she says hurriedly. \u201cLike you tried to commit suicide...like you\u2019ve gone blind...like you can\u2019t speak anymore...Oh! Someone said you\u2019d gouged out your own eyes and that\u2019s why you wear dark glasses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I feel winded from shock. \u201cAnd you believed them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Natalie looks foolish. \u201cOf course I didn\u2019t believe them. But\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gouged out my own eyes? Like Van Gogh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was ears,\u201d Natalie points out. \u201cOnly one ear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gouged out my own eyes?\u201d I feel a bit hysterical. A weird, painful laughter is bubbling through me. \u201cYou believed it, didn\u2019t you, Nat? You believed it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t!\u201d Natalie is getting all pink. \u201cOf course I didn\u2019t. I\u2019m just telling you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you thought I was a bipolar homicidal maniac.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even know what bipolar means,\u201d admits Natalie. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s just one of those words.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA bipolar, homicidal maniac with gouged-out eyes.\u201d I feel a fresh wave of hysteria. \u201cNo wonder your mum\u2019s outside in the car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it!\u201d wails Natalie. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean any of it!\u201d</p><p>Natalie is a total, utter dope and her mum is worse. But I can\u2019t help feeling a wave of affection as I watch her, all miserable and flustered and not knowing what to say. I\u2019ve known Nat since we were six, and even then she was totally wide-eyed and thought my dad really was Father Christmas. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I say at last, letting Natalie off the hook. \u201cIt\u2019s fine.

I have to think for a few seconds before I reply.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting better,\u201d I say at last. \u201cThat\u2019s what I am.\u201d I reach for the last piece of the chocolate bar and split it into two. \u201cC\u2019mon. Let\u2019s finish this before Frank sees it.\u201d</p> <p>Dr. Sarah loves the bipolar homicidal maniac story.</p><p>Well, I say \u201cloves.\u201d She actually groans and clutches her hair with both hands and says \u201cSeriously?\u201d And I can see her writing Outreach program\u2014schools? EDUCATE??? on her notepad.</p><p>But I just laugh. I mean, it is funny, even if it\u2019s all wrong too. You have to see that.</p><p>I laugh a lot more when I see Dr. Sarah these days. And I talk a lot more. For a long time it seemed like she had more to say than I did. It seemed like she did most of the talking and I did most of the listening. (To be fair, I wasn\u2019t wild about communication of any type when we first met. To be even more fair, at our first session I wouldn\u2019t even come in the room, let alone look at her, let alone speak.) But now things have flipped the other way. I have so much to tell her! About Linus, Natalie, all my trips out, that time I went on the bus and didn\u2019t panic one bit...</p><p>\u201cSo anyway, I reckon I\u2019m done,\u201d I say as I finish my last story. \u201cI\u2019m cooked.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCooked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCured.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Dr. Sarah taps her pencil thoughtfully. \u201cWhich means...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know. I\u2019m fine. Back to normal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re certainly making very good progress. I\u2019m delighted, Audrey. Really delighted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not just \u2018good progress,\u2019 \u201d I say impatiently. \u201cI\u2019m back to normal. I mean, you know. Practically.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMmhhm.\u201d Dr. Sarah always leaves a polite pause before she contradicts me. \u201cYou haven\u2019t been back to school yet,\u201d she points out. \u201cYou\u2019re still wearing dark glasses. You\u2019re still on medication.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK, I said \u2018practically.\u2019 \u201d I feel a spike of anger. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be so negative.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAudrey, I just need you to be realistic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am!\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember the graph of your progress that I drew? The jagged line?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, well, that graph is old news,\u201d I say. \u201cThis is my graph.\u201d</p><p>I stand up, march to the white board and draw a straight line, zooming up to the stars. \u201cThis is me. No more down. Only up.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Sarah sighs. \u201cAudrey, I\u2019d love that to be true. But the overwhelming majority of patients recovering from an episode such as yours will encounter setbacks. And that\u2019s fine. It\u2019s normal.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ve had all my setbacks.\u201d I look at her stonily. \u201cI\u2019ve done setbacks, OK? I\u2019m just not having any more. It\u2019s not happening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re frustrated, Audrey\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking positive. What\u2019s wrong with that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. Just don\u2019t overdo it. Don\u2019t put pressure on yourself. The danger is that you give yourself a real setback.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I say resolutely.</p><p>\u201cYes, you are.\u201d She nods. \u201cBut you\u2019re also fragile. Imagine a mended china plate which hasn\u2019t quite set.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a plate?\u201d I say sardonically, but Dr. Sarah doesn\u2019t rise to it.</p><p>\u201cI had a patient a few years ago, very similar to you, Audrey, who was at the same stage of her recovery. She decided to go to Disneyland Paris, against my advice.\u201d She rolls her eyes. \u201cDisneyland! Of all places!\u201d</p><p>Even the idea of Disneyland makes me wince, not that I\u2019ll admit that to Dr. Sarah.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d I can\u2019t resist asking.</p><p>\u201cIt was far too much for her. She had to come home from the trip early. Then she felt she\u2019d failed. Her mood sank to the lowest it had been, and it didn\u2019t do her progress any good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I won\u2019t go to Disneyland.\u201d I fold my arms. \u201cSo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I know you\u2019re sensible.\u201d As Dr. Sarah surveys me, her mouth twitches. \u201cYou\u2019ve got your spirit back, at any rate. And life is good?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLife is good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Linus is still...\u201d She pauses delicately.</p><p>\u201cLinus.\u201d I nod. \u201cHe\u2019s still Linus.

DAY.</p> <p>LONG SHOT: Linus and FELIX are sitting in the garden. They have a chessboard between them and appear to be playing chess.</p><p>The camera pans closer and their voices become audible.</p><p>Felix moves a piece and looks triumphantly at Linus.</p><p>FELIX</p><p>Chess</p><p>Linus moves a piece.</p> <p>LINUS</p><p>Chess.</p><p>Felix moves a piece. Chess.</p><p>FELIX</p><p>Chess.</p><p>Linus moves a piece.</p><p>LINUS</p><p>Chess.</p> <p>He looks at Felix seriously.</p><p>LINUS</p><p>This is a good game you invented, Felix.</p><p>Felix beams at him.</p><p>FELIX</p><p>I know.</p><p>LINUS</p><p>What do you call it again?</p><p>FELIX</p><p>Squares.</p><p>Linus is struggling to keep a straight face.</p><p>LINUS</p><p>That\u2019s right. Squares. So why don\u2019t we say \u201cSquares\u201d when we move the pieces?</p><p>Felix looks at him pityingly, as though he\u2019s a little dim.</p><p>FELIX</p><p>Because we say \u201cChess.\u201d</p><p>Linus looks at the camera.</p><p>LINUS</p><p>That tells me.</p><p>Mum comes into the garden.</p><p>MUM</p><p>Linus! You\u2019re here! Marvellous. Now, you speak German, don\u2019t you?</p><p>LINUS</p><p>(warily)</p><p>A bit.</p><p>MUM</p><p>Great! Well, you can come and help me decipher my new dishwasher instructions. The whole leaflet\u2019s in German. I mean, German. I ask you.</p><p>LINUS</p><p>Oh. OK.</p><p>As he gets up, Felix grabs onto his leg.</p><p>FELIX</p><p>Lin-us! Play Squares!</p><p>At this moment, Frank comes into the garden and brandishes a gaming magazine at Linus.</p><p>FRANK</p><p>Linus, you have to see this.</p><p>AUDREY (VOICE-OVER)</p><p>What is this family LIKE? Stop trying to kidnap my boyfriend, everyone. OK?</p><p>Dr. Sarah has said I need to increase my interactions with strangers. It\u2019s not enough just to go to a restaurant and hide behind a menu and let other people order for me. (How did she guess?) I need to talk confidently to unfamiliar people. This is my homework. So Linus and I are sitting in Starbucks and he\u2019s choosing someone random for me to go and talk to.</p><p>We did all kinds of role-play in hospital, which was supposed to achieve the same aim. But role-play is role-play. You feel so stupid. OMG it was embarrassing, pretending to have a \u201cconfrontation\u201d with some skinny boy who you knew would practically go into a panic attack if you even looked at him. And all the counsellors having to feed us lines when we dried up, and saying \u201cLook at your body language, Audrey.\u201d</p><p>Anyway. So role-play totally sucks, but this is kind of fun. Because I\u2019m going to do one and then Linus is going to do one. It\u2019s like dares.</p><p>\u201cOK, that guy.\u201d Linus points to a man on his own at a corner table, who\u2019s tapping away at a laptop. He\u2019s in his twenties with a goatee and has a grey T-shirt and one of those cool leather man-bags that Frank despises. \u201cGo up to that guy and ask him if he has Wi-Fi.\u201d</p><p>I feel a bubble of panic, which I try to swallow down. The man looks absorbed in his work. He doesn\u2019t look like he wants to be interrupted.</p><p>\u201cHe looks really busy...\u201d I prevaricate. \u201cWhat about someone else? What about that old lady?\u201d There\u2019s a sweet-looking, grey-haired woman sitting at the next table, who has already smiled in our direction.</p><p>\u201cToo easy.\u201d Linus is adamant. \u201cYou won\u2019t need to say a word, she\u2019ll just jabber at you. Go up to that guy and ask about the Wi-Fi. I\u2019ll wait here.\u201d</p><p>Everything in my body is telling me not to go, but Linus is sitting there looking at me, so I force my leg muscles to operate. Somehow I\u2019m walking across the coffee shop and now I\u2019m standing right in front of the man, but he hasn\u2019t looked at me.

He hasn\u2019t even looked up.</p><p>I so want to back away. But Linus is watching. I have to see this through.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d My voice bursts out so loudly I almost jump in fright, and finally the man lifts his head. \u201cI was wondering if you have Wi-Fi?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He scowls.</p><p>\u201cWi-Fi?

Can you read, at all?\u201d He points to a notice in the corner of the coffee shop, which is all about the Starbucks Wi-Fi code. Then he focuses on my dark glasses. \u201cAre you blind? Or just subnormal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not blind,\u201d I say, my voice trembling. \u201cI was just asking. Sorry to bother you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFucking moron,\u201d he mutters as he starts tapping again.</p><p>Tears are welling in my eyes, and as I back away, my legs are wobbly. But my chin is high. I\u2019m determined I\u2019m not going to dissolve. As I get back to the table, I force a kind of rictus grin onto my face.</p><p>\u201cI did it!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d demands Linus.</p><p>\u201cHe called me a fucking moron. And blind and subnormal. Apart from that, you know, he was really charming.\u201d</p><p>The tears in my eyes are edging down my cheeks by now, and Linus stares at them in alarm.</p><p>\u201cAudrey!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine,\u201d I say fiercely. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWanker.\u201d Linus is glaring balefully at the man in the grey T-shirt. \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t want to be disturbed, he shouldn\u2019t come and sit in a public place. You realize how much he\u2019s saving on rent? He buys one coffee and sits there for an hour and then he expects the whole world to tiptoe around him. If he wants an office he should pay for an office. Fucker.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnyway, I did it.\u201d I speak brightly. \u201cYour turn now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m speaking to the same guy.\u201d Linus gets to his feet. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t get away with being such a prick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to say?\u201d I ask in panic. A choking dread is filling my chest, and I don\u2019t even know what I\u2019m scared of. I just don\u2019t want Linus to go over there. I want to leave. \u201cSit down,\u201d I beg him. \u201cLet\u2019s stop the game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe game hasn\u2019t finished.\u201d Linus winks at me and heads over to the corner table, coffee in hand. \u201cHi!\u201d he says to the man in a childish voice which is so loud that half the coffee shop looks round. \u201cThat\u2019s an Apple Mac, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>The man looks up as though in disbelief at being interrupted again.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he says curtly.</p><p>\u201cCould you tell me the advantages of an Apple Mac over other brands of computer?\u201d says Linus. \u201cBecause I want to buy a computer. Is your one really good? I bet it is.\u201d He sits down opposite the man. \u201cCan I have a go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019m busy,\u201d the man snaps. \u201cCould you sit somewhere else?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you working here?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s silence as the man continues tapping and Linus leans forward. \u201cAre you working?\u201d he repeats in a foghorn voice.</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d The man glowers at him. \u201cI\u2019m working.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy dad works in an office,\u201d says Linus artlessly. \u201cDon\u2019t you have an office? What do you do? Could I be like your shadow? Will you come and give a talk to our school? Oh look, your cup\u2019s empty. Are you going to buy another coffee? Was that a cappuccino? I like flat whites. But why are they called flat whites? Do you know? Can you look it up for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen.\u201d The man slams his laptop shut. \u201cKid. I\u2019m working. Could you please find another table?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut this is Starbucks,\u201d says Linus in tones of surprise. \u201cYou can sit anywhere. You\u2019re allowed.\u201d He flags down a female barista who\u2019s collecting empty cups nearby. \u201cExcuse me, can I sit anywhere? Is that how Starbucks works?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d says the barista, and smiles at him. \u201cAnywhere you like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you hear that? Anywhere I like. And I\u2019ve got a cup of coffee, but you haven\u2019t,\u201d Linus points out to the man. \u201cYou\u2019ve finished yours. Hey, wait.\u201d He gives the empty cup to the barista. \u201cSee?\u201d he says to the man. \u201cYou\u2019re all done. You should either buy a cup of coffee or go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus!\u201d Looking like he wants to explode, the man shoves his laptop into his man-bag and gets to his feet.</p><p>\u201cFucking kids,\u201d he mutters to himself. \u201cUnbelievable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye then,\u201d says Linus innocently. \u201cHave fun being a wanker.\u201d</p><p>For an instant I think the man might hit him round the head\u2014but of course he doesn\u2019t. He just heads out of the coffee shop looking savage. Linus gets up and slides back into the seat opposite me, his face all creased up into his orange segment smile. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh my God.\u201d I exhale. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you did that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext time, you do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could.

I haven\u2019t even got time to think about whether I\u2019m nervous or not.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, do you serve mint muffins?\u201d I say, adopting Linus\u2019s innocent, childlike tones.

I\u2019m not me, I\u2019m not Audrey, I\u2019m a character.</p><p>\u201cAh, no.\u201d She shakes her head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I saw them on the website,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019m sure I saw them. Mint muffins with a chocolate centre? With, like, sprinkles?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd Polo mints on top,\u201d chimes in Linus seriously, and I nearly crease up with laughter.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The barista looks puzzled. \u201cI never heard of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh well,\u201d I say politely, \u201cthank you anyway.\u201d As she walks off, I grin at Linus, feeling a bit heady. \u201cI did it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can talk to anyone.\u201d He nods. \u201cNext, why don\u2019t you hire a soapbox and make a speech?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat idea!\u201d I say. \u201cLet\u2019s invite, like, a thousand people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo the graph is going upwards. Miss Audrey is heading for the stars.\u201d Linus knows about the jagged/not-jagged graph, because I told him about it. I drew it out and everything.</p> <p>\u201cDefinitely.\u201d I clink my coffee cup against his. \u201cMiss Audrey is heading for the stars.\u201d</p><p>Which just proves it: I\u2019m in charge of my graph. Me. And if I want a straight graph, I\u2019ll have a straight graph.</p><p>So at my next session with Dr. Sarah, I lie a little when I\u2019m filling in my tick boxes.</p><p>Have you experienced worries most days? Not at all.</p><p>Do you find your worries difficult to control? Not at all.</p><p>She looks at the sheet with raised eyebrows when I hand it to her.</p><p>\u201cWell. This is an improvement!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou see?\u201d I can\u2019t help saying at once. \u201cYou see?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you have any idea why you\u2019ve improved so much this week, Audrey?\u201d She smiles at me. \u201cLife\u2019s good, is it just that? Or anything else? Any changes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDunno.\u201d I shrug innocently. \u201cI can\u2019t think of anything that\u2019s changed in particular.\u201d</p><p>Which is another lie. Something that\u2019s changed is: I\u2019ve stopped taking my meds. I just take the pills out of the blister packs and chuck them away in a screwed-up envelope. (Not down the loo, because all the chemicals get into the water or whatever.)</p><p>And guess what? I haven\u2019t noticed a single difference. Which just proves I didn\u2019t need them.</p><p>I haven\u2019t told anybody. Well, obviously I haven\u2019t, because they\u2019d stress out. I\u2019m going to wait, like, a month and then I\u2019ll casually tell everyone and I\u2019ll be like, you see?</p><p>\u201cI told you,\u201d I say to Dr. Sarah. \u201cI\u2019m cooked. I\u2019m done. All better.\u201d</p><p>Mum\u2019s in an organizing mood. She\u2019s sweeping around the house, tidying and shouting and saying \u201cWhose shoes are these? What are they doing here?\u201d and we\u2019ve all hidden in the garden. I mean me, Frank, Linus, and Felix. It\u2019s a warm day anyway, so it\u2019s nice, just sitting on the grass, picking daisies.</p><p>There\u2019s a rustling sound, and Dad appears round the side of the bush we\u2019re lurking behind.</p><p>\u201cHi, Dad,\u201d says Frank. \u201cHave you come to join the Rebel Alliance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrank, I think your mother wants you,\u201d says Dad.</p><p>Your mother. Code for: Don\u2019t associate me with Mum\u2019s latest nutty plan, I have nothing to do with it.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Frank gives an unpromising scowl. \u201cI\u2019m busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBusy hiding behind a bush?\u201d I say, and snort with laughter.</p><p>\u201cYou offered to help?\u201d Dad says. \u201cFor the Avonlea fete catering? I think they\u2019re starting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did not offer to help,\u201d says Frank, looking outraged. \u201cI did not offer. I was forced. This is forced labour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have such a great attitude,\u201d I observe. \u201cHelping your fellow man and everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t notice you helping your fellow man,\u201d Frank shoots back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help my fellow man.\u201d I shrug. \u201cI don\u2019t mind making a few sandwiches.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnyway, fellow man?\u201d counters Frank. \u201cThat\u2019s sexist.

Frank! Where are you!\u201d in her most ominous You\u2019ll-pay-for-this-later voice and it\u2019s like we all realize there\u2019s no point hiding out here anymore. Frank trudges back to the house looking like a condemned man and I take a few deep breaths because I\u2019m feeling a little edgy.</p> <p>I mean, I\u2019m fine. I\u2019m not panicking or anything. I\u2019m just a tiny bit\u2014</p><p>Well. A bit jittery. Dunno why. I\u2019m probably just getting back to normal after all those months polluting my body with chemicals. I mean, when is the last time I knew what normal even was?</p><p>The kitchen is full of the most motley crew of people. There\u2019s one old lady in an ancient purple suit and hair which is clearly a wig. There\u2019s one middle-aged lady with plaits and sandals. There\u2019s a plump couple who are wearing matching St. Luke\u2019s Church sweatshirts. And a white-haired man on a mobility scooter.</p><p>The mobility scooter\u2019s pretty cool, actually. But it is kind of getting in everyone\u2019s way.</p><p>\u201cRight!\u201d Mum comes in and claps her hands. \u201cWelcome, everybody, and thank you for coming along today. So, the fete starts at three. I\u2019ve bought lots of ingredients...\u201d She starts emptying food out of supermarket carriers onto the kitchen table\u2014stuff like tomatoes and cucumbers, lettuce and bread, chicken and ham. \u201cI thought we could make some sandwiches, stuffed wraps, um...does anyone have any other ideas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSausage rolls?\u201d says the plump woman.</p> <p>\u201cRight.\u201d Mum nods. \u201cD\u2019you mean buy sausage rolls or make sausage rolls?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoh.\u201d The plump woman looks baffled. \u201cI don\u2019t know. But people like sausage rolls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we haven\u2019t got any sausage rolls. Or any sausage meat. So\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a shame,\u201d says the plump woman. \u201cBecause people like sausage rolls.\u201d</p><p>Her husband nods. \u201cThey do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone loves a sausage roll.\u201d</p><p>I can see Mum getting a little tense. \u201cMaybe next time,\u201d she says brightly. \u201cMoving on. So, I thought...egg sandwiches?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMum!\u201d Frank says in horror. \u201cEgg sandwiches are rank.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI like egg sandwiches!\u201d says Mum defensively. \u201cDoes anyone else like egg sandwiches?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweetheart, I think we can do better than egg sandwiches.\u201d A man\u2019s voice cuts across Mum\u2019s, and we all look up. A bloke I\u2019ve never seen before is striding into the kitchen. He must be in his twenties. He\u2019s got a shaved head and about six earrings in one ear and is wearing one of those chef outfits.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Ade,\u201d he announces. \u201cMy grandad\u2019s Derek Gould\u2014he just moved into Avonlea. Told me about this. What are we doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you a chef?\u201d Mum goggles at him. \u201cA professional chef?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI work at the Fox and Hounds. I\u2019ve got an hour. This what you\u2019ve got?\u201d He\u2019s turning Mum\u2019s food over in his hands. \u201cI think we can knock up some nice fresh fillings to go in the wraps, maybe a Waldorf salad, maybe roast this fennel off and do it with a lemon-tarragon dressing...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYoung man.\u201d Purple lady waves a hand in his face. \u201cHow will we keep salads fresh on a day like today?\u201d</p><p>Ade looks surprised. \u201cOh, I brought the chill boxes from the pub. Thirty. And all the other catering supplies. You can give them back tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>The purple lady blinks at him in surprise.</p><p>\u201cChill boxes?\u201d Mum is starting to look overexcited. \u201cCatering supplies? You\u2019re a saint!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problemo. OK, so our menu is Waldorf salad wrap, Mexican bean wrap, a couple of salads\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, could we use some eggs?\u201d says Mum, looking embarrassed. \u201cI bought a whole load of eggs for egg sandwiches, which no-one seems keen on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpanish omelette,\u201d says Ade without missing a beat. \u201cWe\u2019ll put in some chorizo, garlic, fry off some sweet onion, serve it in slices...\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I love Spanish omelette. This guy is so cool!</p><p>\u201cI bought lots of peppers too,\u201d says Mum eagerly, handing him one. \u201cCould they go in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect.\u201d</p><p>Ade takes the pepper from Mum and turns it over in his fingers. Then he opens up his back pack to reveal a set of knives, all carefully packed in covers. We watch agog as he takes a chopping board from the kitchen table, places the pepper on it, and starts chopping it up.</p> <p>Oh my God, I have never seen anyone chop so fast.</p><p>Chop-chop-chop-chop-chop.</p><p>Everyone in the kitchen is just staring in astonishment. Even Frank. In fact, especially Frank. When Ade finishes and everyone bursts into applause, Frank is the only one who is still transfixed, his eyes like saucers.</p><p>\u201cYou.\u201d Ade seems to notice him. \u201cI want you on dicing duty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d Frank swallows. \u201cI can\u2019t do that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll teach you. No sweat.\u201d Ade looks Frank up and down. \u201cYou cooking in that? Got an apron?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can find one,\u201d says Frank hastily, and I stifle a giggle. Frank\u2019s going to wear an apron?</p><p>Ade is now rootling around in Mum\u2019s cupboards, dumping ingredients all over the counter.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to make a shopping list,\u201d he announces. \u201cWe need Parmesan, more garlic, harissa...Who\u2019s our runner?\u201d He looks at me. \u201cPretty girl in the dark glasses. You want to be our runner?\u201d</p><p>Shopping\u2019s OK-ish for me now.</p><p>I mean, it\u2019s not always easy. I still have to deal with my lizard brain, which springs into action whenever I don\u2019t want it to. Over the last few days, I\u2019ve been feeling these, like, waves of panic at random times, which is really annoying, because I thought I\u2019d got rid of them.</p> <p>But what I\u2019ve learned is not to fight my lizard brain, but kind of tolerate it. Listen to it and then say, \u201cYeah, whatever.\u201d Just like you tolerate a four-year-old. I\u2019ve come to think of my lizard brain as basically a version of Felix. It\u2019s totally random and makes no sense and you can\u2019t let it run your life. If we let Felix run our lives, we\u2019d all wear superhero costumes all day long and eat nothing but ice-cream.</p><p>But if you try to fight Felix, all you get is wails and screams and tantrums, and it all gets more and more stressy. So the thing is to listen to him with half an ear and nod your head and then ignore him and do what you want to do.</p><p>Same with the lizard brain.</p><p>So when I freeze in sudden terror at the entrance to the supermarket, I force myself to smile and say, \u201cNice try, lizard brain.\u201d I actually say it aloud, and exhale for twelve beats. (If you breathe out really slowly, it regulates the carbon dioxide in the brain and calms you down, instantly. Try it if you don\u2019t believe me.) Then I saunter in, doing my best impression of someone who really couldn\u2019t give a toss what some old reptile thinks.</p><p>And you know what? It kind of works.</p><p>When I get back home, holding two carrier bags, I stop dead in astonishment. Frank\u2019s standing at the kitchen counter, chopping.</p><p>He\u2019s wearing one of Mum\u2019s aprons and he\u2019s holding a knife I don\u2019t recognize and he\u2019s learned that cool-chef way of doing it. That chop-chop-chop thing. Fast. He\u2019s pink in the face and totally absorbed. Like, he doesn\u2019t even notice me watching, let alone come up with some wisecrack.</p><p>\u201cGreat!\u201d Ade has noticed me and grabs the bags. \u201cLet\u2019s get that garlic out.\u201d He sniffs it and rubs the papery skin. \u201cBeautiful. OK, Frank, I want it finely diced. All of it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, chef,\u201d says Frank, breathlessly, and takes the garlic.</p><p>Yes, chef?</p><p>Yes, chef?</p><p>OK, what has happened to Frank?</p><p>MY SERENE AND LOVING FAMILY\u2014FILM TRANSCRIPT</p><p>INTERIOR. 5 ROSEWOOD CLOSE.

I won this in the raffle.</p><p>A hand picks up a fluffy pink loo roll cover from the kitchen table.</p><p>AUDREY (V.O.)</p><p>You put it on your loo roll. Isn\u2019t it like the grossest thing you have ever seen?</p><p>She replaces the loo roll cover.</p><p>AUDREY (V.O.)</p><p>But everyone LOVED the food. I mean, it all sold out in, like, five minutes, and it got a special mention from the mayor.</p><p>The camera focuses in on Frank. He\u2019s watching a YouTube video of a chef chopping.</p><p>FRANK</p><p>D\u2019you think Mum would buy me a set of knives? Like, proper knives?</p><p>AUDREY (V.O.)</p><p>Dunno.

He singes a chicken.</p><p>AUDREY (V.O.)</p> <p>Wow. Well, it was delicious food. No-one could stop talking about it.</p><p>FRANK</p><p>The Waldorf needed more seasoning. That\u2019s what Ade said.</p><p>AUDREY (V.O.)</p><p>Tasted OK to me.</p><p>The camera moves out of the kitchen and towards the garden door. There it pauses. We see Mum and Dad, standing by the play house, talking in low voices. Mum is holding a letter and gesticulating furiously with it at Dad.</p> <p>MUM</p><p>I can\u2019t believe they would even ask this.</p><p>DAD</p><p>Anne, don\u2019t take it personally.</p><p>MUM</p><p>How can I not take it personally? How can they have the gall? The nerve?</p><p>DAD</p><p>I know. It\u2019s preposterous.</p> <p>MUM</p><p>It\u2019s monstrous! Do you realize how much damage they could do to Audrey? I\u2019m going to email this woman tonight, and I\u2019m going to tell her what I think of her and\u2014</p><p>DAD</p><p>I\u2019ll send it.</p><p>MUM</p><p>(fiercely)</p><p>Well, I\u2019m contributing. And you\u2019re NOT censoring me, Chris.</p><p>DAD</p><p>We\u2019ll work out an email together. We don\u2019t want to be too antagonistic.</p><p>MUM</p><p>Too antagonistic? Are you joking?</p><p>AUDREY (V.O.)</p><p>About what?</p><p>Both parents whip round in shock.</p><p>AUDREY (V.O.)</p><p>What\u2019s going on?</p><p>MUM</p><p>Audrey!</p><p>DAD</p><p>It\u2019s nothing, sweetie.</p><p>MUM</p><p>Nothing for you to worry about. Um, wasn\u2019t the fete fun?</p><p>There\u2019s a pause as the camera surveys their anxious faces and zooms in on Mum\u2019s hand, clutching the letter.</p><p>AUDREY (V.O.)</p><p>Yes. It was super-fun.</p><p>What were they looking at? What?</p><p>I\u2019m totally flummoxed. Mum and Dad have never been like that before. They were so anxious that I shouldn\u2019t know what they were talking about, they were kind of aggressive. I mean, Mum was almost snarly.</p><p>So whatever it is, they don\u2019t want me to have even the slightest inkling of it.</p><p>I\u2019m nonplussed. I can\u2019t even go through all the possible theories in my head and eliminate them, because I don\u2019t have any theories. Maybe something to do with Dr. Sarah? That\u2019s all I can think of. Maybe she wants to do some weirdo experimental treatment on me and Mum and Dad are mad at her for asking?</p><p>But Dr. Sarah wouldn\u2019t do that. She wouldn\u2019t just land something like that on me. Would she? And Mum and Dad wouldn\u2019t call her they.</p><p>That evening at supper I bring it up again, and both Mum and Dad practically bite my head off.</p><p>\u201cIt was nothing,\u201d says Mum, eating her pasta very fast and crossly. \u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMum, it was something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to know every something in the world, Audrey.\u201d</p><p>As she says that, I feel a sudden shaft of fear\u2014is Mum ill or something? Is there some massive family tragedy coming along to hit us like a juggernaut and that\u2019s why she won\u2019t say anything?</p><p>But no, she said damage Audrey. And they. It\u2019s all about they, whoever they are.</p><p>That evening Mum and Dad are closeted in Dad\u2019s study for, like, two hours, and then eventually they emerge, and Mum says, \u201cWell, there we are, then.\u201d There\u2019s a kind of dark, satisfied cloud surrounding her. I have a feeling her email didn\u2019t hold back.</p><p>Dad announces he\u2019s off for a quick half with Mike who he plays squash with, and Mum says she\u2019s going to have a bath. I wait until I can hear the water running, then sidle along to Frank, who\u2019s in his room, listening to his iPod.</p><p>\u201cFrank, can you hack into Dad\u2019s emails?\u201d I say in a low voice.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we do it? Now?\u201d</p><p>From the way Frank gets straight into Dad\u2019s inbox, it\u2019s clear he\u2019s done this before. He even knows Dad\u2019s weirdo password, which is all signs and numbers and gibberish.</p><p>\u201cDo you often look at Dad\u2019s emails?\u201d I say curiously, perching on the side of the office chair.</p><p>\u201cSometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes he know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCourse not.\u201d Franks clicks on a couple of emails from someone called George Stourhead. \u201cThere\u2019s some quite interesting stuff. Did you know he applied for another job last year?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t get it. But his mate Allan reckons the company\u2019s in trouble anyway, so Dad\u2019s well out of it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh.\u201d I digest this for a moment. \u201cThat\u2019s not interesting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s better than geography coursework.

You\u2019re Topic A in this family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I stare at him, taken aback. I don\u2019t know what to say to that. I don\u2019t want to be Topic A.

Frank could show me, I could ask him...</p><p>Even at the thought, it\u2019s as if a big iron gate clanks down in my mind. No. I\u2019m not going to look. Not at anything more than is necessary. I don\u2019t want to know what Mum secretly thinks. We\u2019re all allowed our private places.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t spy on Mum and Dad,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re spying too,\u201d retorts Frank.</p> <p>\u201cOK, but...\u201d I wince, knowing he\u2019s right. \u201cThis is necessary. This is a one-off and it\u2019s about me and it\u2019s important and...I won\u2019t ever do it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis\u2019ll be it, I bet.\u201d Frank is clicking on a recently sent email called Your request.</p><p>As the text comes up I scan straight to the bottom and it\u2019s signed from Anne and Chris Turner.</p><p>\u201cOh my God.\u201d Frank is chuckling. \u201cMum\u2019s really let this person have it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShhh! Let me read it!\u201d</p><p>I peer over his shoulder and squint at the words.</p><p>Dear Mrs. Lawton</p><p>We are writing to you in shock, horror, and dismay. First, that you would have the nerve to write an email directly to our daughter, Audrey, in a completely inappropriate manner. Second, that you should make such an outrageous request. I am sorry that your daughter Izzy is having problems, but if you think that Audrey would be willing to meet her, you must be quite mad. Do you recall the situation here? Do you recall the fact that our daughter was persecuted by your daughter (among others)? Are you aware that Audrey has not returned to school since the events and spent several weeks in hospital?</p> <p>We don\u2019t care if Izzy wants to apologise or not. We are not risking any further psychological damage to our daughter.</p><p>Yours,</p><p>Anne and Chris Turner</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Izzy?\u201d says Frank. \u201cOne of them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I\u2019m getting the sick, poisoned feeling again. Just that name Izzy does it.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe she wants to see me,\u201d I say, my eyes fixed on the words. \u201cAfter all this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, they said no. So you\u2019re off the hook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are! Look, Mum and Dad will back you up. You don\u2019t have to see anyone. Audrey, you practically don\u2019t even have to go to school ever again. You can do whatever the hell you like. Do you appreciate your position?\u201d Frank clicks on another email. \u201cYou don\u2019t, do you? It\u2019s wasted on you.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m only barely aware of him. Thoughts are spinning around my brain. Thoughts I don\u2019t even understand myself. Thoughts I don\u2019t want.</p><p>Without realizing I\u2019ve done it, I\u2019ve crumpled down on the floor and buried my head in my hands. I need all my energy for thinking.</p><p>\u201cAud?\u201d Frank suddenly seems to notice. \u201cAud, what\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand,\u201d I say. \u201cReading this\u2014knowing that they\u2019ve asked\u2014that\u2019s put me on the hook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause...\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t say it.

But they won\u2019t disappear.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I should see her.\u201d I force it out. \u201cMaybe I should go and see her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Frank looks aghast. \u201cWhy would you do that?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.

You know, it\u2019s been shit enough for you already, Aud. Don\u2019t make things worse.

Did you see what I did?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I deleted a document. Oops.\u201d He clicks madly. \u201cCome on, you bastard\u2014undo. Hey, don\u2019t tell Dad we did this, will you? Because if I\u2019ve lost anything, he is going to go insane\u2014\u201d</p><p>Frank says something else, but I walk out, not even hearing him. My head is a whirl and my heart\u2019s thumping and I feel surreal.</p><p>Apologize. I can\u2019t imagine Izzy apologizing. I can\u2019t imagine Izzy saying a lot. She was never the main one. She sort of hung back and agreed and went along with Tasha. Well, let\u2019s face it, everyone in my class went along with Tasha. Because if I was the victim, then they weren\u2019t. Even Natalie stopped standing up for me\u2014</p><p>No. Let\u2019s not go there anymore. Natalie was freaked out. I\u2019ve made my peace with Natalie. It\u2019s all good.</p> <p>Tasha is the one who\u2019s really scary. She\u2019s the one who makes my flesh crawl. She\u2019s bright and smart and motivated and pretty in that strong-jawed athletic way. All the teachers loved her. They loved her. You know, till they found out the truth and everything.</p><p>I\u2019ve had a long time to think about this. And I\u2019ve decided she did it for fun. You know. Because she could.</p><p>My theory is that Tasha will win awards one day. She\u2019ll be some top advertising creative, selling a message to the public and getting everyone to believe it and doing it in a relentless, unremitting, really inspired way. She\u2019ll be one of those advertisers who trick you so you don\u2019t even realize you\u2019re being advertised to, you just give in and start to operate the way she wants you to. She\u2019ll use other people then discard them. Everyone she smiles at will fall under her spell and join the team. The people who hate her will feel totally used and wretched, but who cares about them?</p><p>The real truth, which by the way no grown-up would ever admit to, is that probably the whole experience will do her great in life. It was like, the most put-together project you could imagine. It was innovative. It was sustained. If it had been a GCSE project: Torment Audrey Turner using a variety of imaginative methods, she would have got A+ highly commended.</p><p>I mean yes, she got excluded in the end. But small detail, right?</p><p>In the end, I can\u2019t rest till I\u2019ve had it out. So I march downstairs, way past eleven, when I should be asleep, and catch Mum and Dad in the kitchen making herbal teas.</p> <p>\u201cMum, I read your email and I think I should go and see Izzy,\u201d I say.</p><p>There. Done.</p><p>So that was a no from Mum. And from Dad.</p><p>Mum got pretty mad. I mean, she was mad with Mrs. Lawton, she kept saying, but it sounded like she was more mad with me, from the way she kept coming back to the same topics.</p><p>I do appreciate that reading private emails is beyond the pale.</p><p>I do appreciate that Mum and Dad are juggling some big issues, and they can\u2019t do that if they\u2019re constantly afraid I\u2019m going to hack into their email account all the time.</p><p>Do I want to turn into a household with locked doors? (No.)</p><p>Do I want to live in a family with no trust? (No.)</p> <p>Wait a minute, was this Frank? Did Frank help you? (Silence.)</p><p>Mum\u2019s nostrils were white and her forehead veins were throbbing, and Dad looked grave, seriously grave, like he hasn\u2019t looked for a while, and they were both one hundred percent adamant that seeing Izzy was a nonstarter.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re fragile, Audrey,\u201d Mum kept saying. \u201cYou\u2019re like a piece of china that\u2019s just been mended.\u201d</p><p>She pinched that from Dr. Sarah.</p><p>Does Mum talk to Dr. Sarah behind my back? This has never occurred to me before. But then, I can clearly be quite slow off the mark.</p><p>\u201cSweetheart, I know you think it\u2019ll be a cathartic experience and you\u2019ll say your piece and everyone will come away the wiser,\u201d says Dad. \u201cBut in real life, that doesn\u2019t happen. I\u2019ve confronted enough assholes in my time. They never realize they\u2019re assholes. Not once. Whatever you say.\u201d He turns to Mum. \u201cRemember Ian? My first boss? Now, he was an asshole.

The trouble is, I can\u2019t explain. I don\u2019t know why I want to do it. Except maybe to prove something. But to who? Myself? Izzy?</p><p>Dr. Sarah isn\u2019t wild about hearing about Izzy or Tasha or any of them. She\u2019s all, like, \u201cAudrey, you aren\u2019t validated by other people,\u201d and, \u201cYou\u2019re not responsible for other people\u2019s emotions\u201d and \u201cThis Tasha sounds very tedious, let\u2019s move off the topic.\u201d</p><p>She even gave me a book about unhealthy relationships. (I almost laughed out loud. Could you get any more unhealthy than the relationship between me and Tasha?) It was about how you have to be strong to break free from abuse and not constantly measure yourself against toxic people but stand strong and distinct like a healthy tree. Not some stunted, falling-over, codependent victim tree. Or whatever.</p><p>It\u2019s all very well. But Izzy and Tasha and all of them are still in my mind all the time. They have not checked out of the building. Maybe they never will.</p><p>\u201cIf I don\u2019t do it, it\u2019ll always be a question,\u201d I say at last. \u201cIt\u2019ll bug me my whole life. Could I have done it? Would it have changed things?\u201d</p> <p>Mum and Dad don\u2019t look convinced.</p><p>\u201cYou could say that about anything,\u201d says Mum. \u201cCould you skydive off the Empire State Building? Well, maybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLife\u2019s too short,\u201d says Dad firmly. \u201cMove on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to move on. This is part of moving on!\u201d</p><p>But as I look from face to face I know I\u2019m never going to persuade them. Never, whatever I say.</p><p>So I go to Frank. Who also thinks it\u2019s a bad idea, but the difference is, after we\u2019ve discussed it for about five minutes, he shrugs and says, \u201cYour life.\u201d</p> <p>Dad\u2019s changed his email password, but Frank soon finds it on his BlackBerry on a memo called New Password (poor Dad; he really shouldn\u2019t leave his BlackBerry lying around), and we get into the account. I was planning to write the email myself, but Frank takes over, and honestly, he sounds just like Dad.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been reading too many of Dad\u2019s emails,\u201d I say in awe as I read his words. \u201cThis is amazing!\u201d</p><p>\u201cPiece of piss,\u201d says Frank, but I can tell he\u2019s pleased. And he should be. The email is totally a work of art. It goes like this:</p><p>Dear Mrs. Lawton</p><p>Please forgive my wife and me for our intemperate outburst of yesterday. As you can imagine, we were shocked at being contacted by you and perhaps reacted too quickly.</p><p>On reflection, Audrey would very much like to meet with Izzy and hear what she has to say. Could we suggest 3:00 p.m. next Tuesday, in Starbucks.</p><p>Please do not reply to this email, as my machine is playing up. Please text this number to confirm: 079986 435619.</p><p>With best wishes,</p> <p>Chris Turner</p><p>That\u2019s my new mobile number. After we\u2019ve sent the email, Frank deletes the email and then deletes it again out of Trash, and I think we\u2019re safe.</p><p>And then all of a sudden I feel this lurch of fright. What am I doing? Shit, what am I doing? My heart starts racing, and I can feel my hands twisting up into knots.</p><p>\u201cWill you come with me? Please?\u201d I say before I can stop myself, and Frank turns to give me a long look. I dodge it, turning my head, but then sneak a glance back. He\u2019s looking really anxious, like it\u2019s suddenly hit him too, what we\u2019ve done.</p><p>\u201cAud, are you sure you want to do this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Yes.\u201d I nod, over and over, as though to convince myself. \u201cYes. I\u2019m going to do it. I just need a bit of moral support. If you come with me. And Linus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe three musketeers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you told Linus?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I\u2019m meeting him later at the park. I\u2019ll tell him then.\u201d</p><p>As I get to the park, I have a really bad moment. One of the old, scary kinds. Everyone around looks like a robot out to get me, and the whole place is crackling with this air of dread and threat. My lizard brain is really not enjoying the experience; in fact, my lizard brain wants to crawl under a bush.</p><p>But I\u2019m not crawling under bushes, I tell myself firmly. I\u2019m not listening to any lizards. Even though I feel ill with fear and keep getting these weird, dizzy waves, I manage to stride into the park like a normal person, and spot Linus sitting on a bench. Seeing him anchors me a little. Seeing his orange-segment smile splitting his face, all wide and happy, just for me, feels like someone stroking my lizard brain and telling it to calm down, everything\u2019s fine. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>(I haven\u2019t mentioned my lizard brain to Linus.

Go and ask that man if ducks are vegetarian.\u201d He points to an elderly man throwing bread at the ducks.</p> <p>\u201cAre ducks vegetarian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course they\u2019re not, you dope. They eat worms. Go on.\u201d He pushes my shoulder and I get up with a grin. I\u2019m pulsating with dread but I force myself to have a conversation with the guy about ducks. Then I return to the bench and tell Linus to go and ask a bunch of French tourists which country we\u2019re in.</p><p>Linus is a master. A master. He tells the French tourists in tones of consternation that he was aiming for Sweden, and must have gone astray, and they all start looking at maps and phones and saying \u201cAngleterre! Eeengland!\u201d to him and gesticulating at the red buses that pass the park every five seconds.</p><p>\u201cOh, England,\u201d says Linus at last, and they all nod furiously and say \u201cD\u2019accord! Grande Bretagne! Eeengland!\u201d and at last they head off, all still gabbling and looking back at him. They\u2019ll probably talk about him for the rest of their holiday.</p><p>\u201cOK,\u201d says Linus as he returns to the bench. \u201cGo and ask that guy if he sells coconut ice-cream.\u201d He nods at the ice-cream seller who has had his stall in the park every summer for as long as I can remember.</p> <p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. That\u2019s why you\u2019re asking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo easy,\u201d I say proudly. \u201cThink of another one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t be bothered,\u201d says Linus lazily. \u201cGo and do ice-cream guy.\u201d</p><p>I head over to the stall and patiently wait my turn, and then say,</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, do you sell coconut ice-cream?\u201d</p> <p>I know what he\u2019s going to say. I\u2019ve asked for coconut ice-cream every year since I was about eight, but he never has it.</p><p>\u201cI do today,\u201d says the ice-cream seller, his eyes twinkling. I stare at him stupidly as he reaches for his scoop.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCoconut ice-cream for the young lady,\u201d he says with a flourish. \u201cOne-day special. Just for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I blink in disbelief as he scoops white ice-cream into a massive cone. \u201cIs that coconut?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust for you,\u201d he repeats, handing me the cone. \u201cAnd a chocolate-chip for the young man,\u201d he adds, handing me a second cone. \u201cAll paid for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCoconut\u2019s my favourite flavour,\u201d I say, in a daze. \u201cBut you never have it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what he said. Your young man. Asked me to get it in special-like.\u201d</p> <p>I swivel round, and Linus is watching, his smile wider than ever.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I say to the ice-cream seller. \u201cI mean, thanks.\u201d</p><p>As I reach Linus, I fling my arms round him without dropping either ice-cream and kiss him. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you did that!\u201d I hand him his cone and lick my own. It\u2019s nectar. It\u2019s bliss. Coconut is the best flavour in the world. \u201cOh my God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love it. I love it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do I,\u201d says Linus, licking his own cone. \u201cYou.\u201d</p><p>His words catch on my brain. So do I. You.</p><p>The park is a riot of sunshine and ducks quacking and children shrieking, but right now it\u2019s as though the whole world has shrunk to his face. His brown hair, his honest eyes, that crescent smile.</p><p>\u201cWhat...do you mean?\u201d I force the words out.</p><p>\u201cWhat I said. I love it too,\u201d he says, not taking his eyes off mine.</p><p>\u201cYou said you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...maybe that\u2019s what I meant.\u201d</p><p>I love it. So do I. You.</p><p>The words are dancing round my mind like jigsaw pieces, fitting together this way and that way.</p><p>\u201cWhat, exactly?\u201d I have to say it.</p><p>\u201cYou know exactly.\u201d His eyes are smiling to match his orange-segment mouth. But they\u2019re grave too.</p><p>\u201cWell...I love it too,\u201d I say, my throat tight. \u201cYou.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I swallow. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>We don\u2019t need to say any more. And I know I\u2019ll always remember this moment, right here, standing in the park with the ducks and the sunshine and his arms round me. His kiss tastes of chocolate-chip and I\u2019m sure I taste of coconut.</p><p>Actually, those flavours go very well together. So.</p><p>And it\u2019s only later that life disintegrates. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He doesn\u2019t understand.

You know how many people are willing you to get better? And you pull a stunt like this, just because you \u2018have to\u2019? This is dangerous, if you ask me. And who\u2019s going to pick up the pieces afterwards? Tell me that.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s so righteously indignant, I feel a surge of fury. What does he know? What the fuck does he know about me?</p><p>\u201cThere won\u2019t be any \u2018pieces,\u2019 \u201d I spit at him. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, seeing one girl in Starbucks isn\u2019t dangerous. And anyway, it wasn\u2019t what happened that made me ill. That\u2019s a common mistake people make, actually. Stressful events don\u2019t make you ill, actually. It\u2019s the way your brain reacts to stressful events. So.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK, so how\u2019s your brain going to react to this stressful event?\u201d he shoots back with equal ferocity. \u201cDo a dance and sing \u2018Happy\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to react fine,\u201d I say savagely. \u201cI\u2019m better. And if by any chance it doesn\u2019t, don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t expect you to pick up the pieces. In fact, you know, Linus, I\u2019m sorry I\u2019ve caused you so much trouble already. You\u2019d better find someone else to hang out with. Someone who doesn\u2019t possess any dark glasses. Maybe Tasha, I\u2019ve heard she\u2019s super-fun.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m scrambling to my feet, trying to keep my poise, which isn\u2019t easy when the landscape is looming at me and my head is singing loud protests.</p> <p>\u201cAudrey, stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m going.\u201d</p><p>Tears are coursing down my face, but that\u2019s OK, because I\u2019m keeping it twisted away from Linus.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m coming with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave me alone,\u201d I say, wrenching my arm out of his grasp. \u201cLeave me alone.\u201d And finally, after managing to ignore it all day, I surrender to my lizard brain. And I run.</p><p>Here\u2019s what I\u2019m not supposed to do after a stressful event: Ruminate about it. Brood. Replay it over and over. Take responsibility for anyone else\u2019s emotions.</p><p>Here\u2019s what I\u2019ve been doing ever since my fight with Linus: Ruminating about it. Brooding. Replaying it over and over. Taking responsibility for his fury (yet resenting it). Lurching between despair and indignation. Wanting to call him. Wanting to never call him again.</p><p>Why can\u2019t he understand? I thought he\u2019d admire me. I thought he\u2019d talk about Closure and Courage and say, \u201cYou\u2019re right, Audrey, this is something you have to do, however hard it is, and I\u2019ll be right behind you.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019ve barely slept, the last two nights. It\u2019s like my mind is a cauldron, cooking away, throwing up noxious bubbles and fumes and fermenting itself into something quite weird. I feel light-headed and surreal and hyper. But kind of focused too. I\u2019m going to do this, and it\u2019s going to be like a major turning point, and afterwards things will be different. I don\u2019t know how exactly, but they will. It\u2019s like, I\u2019ll have got over the hurdle or run through the finishing tape or whatever. I\u2019ll be free. Of something.</p><p>So in short, I\u2019m a bit obsessed. But luckily Mum and Dad are too preoccupied with Frank to notice me right now. I\u2019m way down under their radar. Basically, Mum found the Atari in Frank\u2019s room last night and it all kicked off again and now we\u2019re in Family Crisis Mode. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As I come down to breakfast, they\u2019re at it again.</p><p>\u201cFor the millionth time, it\u2019s not a computer,\u201d Frank is saying calmly. \u201cIt\u2019s an Atari console. You said no computers. I classify a computer as a machine which can process information in a number of ways, including word processing, email and Internet browsing. The Atari does none of these, therefore it\u2019s not a computer, therefore it wasn\u2019t a basic breach of trust.\u201d He shovels Shreddies into his mouth. \u201cYou need to tighten up your definitions. That\u2019s the problem. Not my Atari console.\u201d</p><p>I think Frank should be a lawyer one day. I mean, he\u2019s totally nailed the argument, not that Mum appreciates it.</p><p>\u201cDo you hear this?\u201d Mum is appealing to Dad, who looks like he wants to hide behind his newspaper. \u201cThe point is, Frank, we had an agreement. You do not play any kind of video games, end of. Do you know how damaging they are?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJesus.\u201d Frank holds his head in his hands. \u201cMum, you\u2019re the one with a problem with computer games. You\u2019re becoming fixated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not fixated!\u201d She gives a scoffing laugh.</p><p>\u201cYou are! You can\u2019t think about anything else! Do you even know that I got ninety-five in my chemistry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNinety-five?\u201d Mum is stopped in her tracks. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you yesterday, but you didn\u2019t even listen. You were all, Atari! Evil! Get it out of the house!\u201d</p> <p>Mum looks a bit chastened.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she says at last. \u201cWell...ninety-five! That\u2019s great! Well done!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOut of a thousand,\u201d says Frank, then adds, \u201cJoke. Joke.\u201d</p><p>He grins at me, and I try to smile back, though my stomach is churning. All I can think is: Three o\u2019clock. Three o\u2019clock.</p><p>We\u2019ve stuck to the meeting place in Starbucks, even though the Lawtons have been constantly texting, wanting to change it to a \u201cmore conducive location\u201d and offering their own house or a hotel suite or a room at Izzy\u2019s counsellor\u2019s office. Yeah, right.</p><p>Frank has been in charge of all the correspondence. He\u2019s brilliant. He\u2019s batted away all their suggestions in a way that could totally be Dad, and refused to give them an alternative email address, which they keep asking for, and texted in exactly Dad\u2019s style.</p> <p>It\u2019s actually quite funny. I mean, they have no idea it\u2019s just us, two kids. They think Dad and Mum are coming. They think this is a big family meeting. They hope it will be \u201ccathartic for all,\u201d according to their last text.</p><p>As for me, I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m going to see Izzy again. It\u2019s going to happen. The big showdown. I feel like I\u2019m a spring that is slowly coiling up and up, tensing, waiting...</p><p>Only seven hours to go.</p><p>And then suddenly it\u2019s seven minutes to go and I truly feel sick. My head is pounding, not with a headache, but with a kind of impending, heightened sense of reality. The street seems brighter than normal, somehow. Noisier. Rawer.</p><p>Frank\u2019s bunked off school early, which is OK because exams are over, so all they do in lessons is watch \u201ceducational\u201d DVDs. He\u2019s walking along with me, chatting about what happened in assembly this morning when someone brought their pet rat in and let it go. I half want to snap, \u201cShut up! Let me think!\u201d and I\u2019m half grateful for the distraction.</p><p>I\u2019m wearing jeans and a black T-shirt and black trainers. Serious clothes. I have no idea what Izzy will wear. She was never a particularly cool dresser; that was Tasha. I even half wonder if I\u2019ll recognize her. I mean, it wasn\u2019t that long ago, but it feels a whole lifetime.</p><p>But of course I do recognize her, instantly. I see them through the glass before they see us. The mother, the father, both looking anxious, but doing that fake smile thing. And her. Izzy. She\u2019s in some childlike T-shirt with pink ribbon edging, and a pretty skirt. What\u2019s that all about? I want to laugh. But...I can\u2019t.</p><p>I can\u2019t smile either. It\u2019s like all my powers are slipping away, one by one.</p> <p>As I step inside the coffee shop, I know I can\u2019t speak. My insides have turned hollow. Just like that, in an instant. All the inner strength I\u2019ve been building up, the tensed-up spring, the fighting talk...it\u2019s all disappeared.</p><p>I feel small and vulnerable.</p><p>No, not small. I\u2019m taller than her. I still have that. I\u2019m tall.</p><p>But vulnerable. And speechless. And now they\u2019re all looking our way. I squeeze Frank\u2019s hand in silent desperation and he seems to get the message.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d he says briskly, heading towards their table. \u201cLet me introduce myself. Frank Turner. You must be the Lawtons.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He holds out his hand but no-one takes it. Both of Izzy\u2019s parents are looking him up and down in bewilderment.</p><p>\u201cAudrey, we were expecting your parents,\u201d says Mrs. Lawton.</p><p>\u201cThey were unavoidably detained,\u201d says Frank without blinking. \u201cI am the family representative.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d Mrs. Lawton looks flustered. \u201cI really think your parents should\u2014 We understood this would be a family meeting.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI am the Turner family representative,\u201d Frank repeats adamantly. He pulls out a chair and we sit down opposite them. The Lawtons look at each other anxiously and make little mouthing gestures and raised-eyebrow signals, but after a while they quieten down and it\u2019s clear that the conversation about parents is over.</p><p>\u201cWe bought some bottles of water,\u201d says Mrs. Lawton, \u201cbut we can get some teas, coffees, whatever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWater is fine,\u201d says Frank. \u201cLet\u2019s get to the point, shall we? Izzy wants to apologise to Audrey, yes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s put this in context,\u201d says Mr. Lawton heavily. \u201cWe, like you, have gone through some pretty hellish months. We\u2019ve asked ourselves why, over and over. Izzy has asked herself why too. Haven\u2019t you, darling?\u201d He looks gravely at Izzy. \u201cHow could such a thing happen? And, in a way, what did happen and who, in actual fact, was at fault?\u201d</p><p>He presses a hand to Izzy\u2019s, and I look at her properly for the first time. God, she looks different. She looks like an eleven-year-old, I suddenly realize. It\u2019s kind of disturbing. Her hair is in a ponytail with a little-girl bobble, and there\u2019s the infantile ribbony T-shirt going on, and she\u2019s looking up at her father with huge baby eyes. She\u2019s wearing some kind of sickly strawberry lip gloss. I can smell it from here.</p> <p>She hasn\u2019t given me a single glance this whole time. And her parents haven\u2019t made her. If I were them, that\u2019s the first thing I would do. Make her look at me. Make her see me.</p><p>\u201cIzzy has been through a pretty tough journey.\u201d Mr. Lawton continues on what is clearly a prepared speech. \u201cAs you know, she\u2019s homeschooled for now, and she\u2019s undergone a fairly rigorous program of counselling.\u201d</p><p>Snap, I think.</p><p>\u201cBut she\u2019s finding it hard to move on.\u201d Mr. Lawton clutches Izzy\u2019s hand, and she looks imploringly up at him. \u201cAren\u2019t you, darling? She unfortunately suffers from clinical depression.\u201d</p><p>He says it like it\u2019s a trump card. What, are we supposed to applaud? Tell him how sorry we are, wow, depression, that must be horrible?</p><p>\u201cSo what?\u201d says Frank scathingly. \u201cSo\u2019s Audrey.\u201d He addresses Izzy directly. \u201cI know what you did to my sister. I\u2019d be depressed if I were you too.\u201d</p> <p>Both Lawtons inhale sharply and Mr. Lawton puts a hand to his head.</p><p>\u201cI was hoping for a more constructive approach to the meeting,\u201d he says. \u201cPerhaps we could keep the insults to ourselves?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not an insult!\u201d says Frank. \u201cIt\u2019s the truth! And I thought Izzy was going to apologise? Where\u2019s the apology?\u201d He pokes Izzy\u2019s arm and she withdraws it with a gasp.</p><p>\u201cIzzy has been working with her team,\u201d says Mr. Lawton. \u201cShe\u2019s written a piece which she would like to deliver to Audrey.\u201d He pats Izzy on the shoulder. \u201cIzzy devised this in one of her poetry workshops.\u201d</p><p>Poetry? Poetry?</p><p>I hear Frank snort and both Lawtons look at him with dislike.</p><p>\u201cThis will be hard for Izzy,\u201d says Mrs. Lawton coldly. \u201cShe is very fragile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs we all are,\u201d says Mr. Lawton, nodding at me and making a face at his wife.</p> <p>\u201cYes, of course,\u201d says Mrs. Lawton, but she doesn\u2019t sound convinced. \u201cSo we ask you to listen to her piece in silence, without comment. Then we can move into the discussion phase of the meeting.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s silence as Izzy unfurls a wad of A4 pages. She still hasn\u2019t looked at me properly. Still.</p><p>\u201cYou can do it, Izzy,\u201d whispers her mother. \u201cBe brave.\u201d Her father pats her hand and I see Frank make a barf gesture.</p><p>\u201c \u2018When the darkness came,\u2019 \u201d says Izzy in a trembling voice. \u201cBy Isobel Lawton. \u2018It came on me, the darkness. I followed when I should not. I acted when I should not. And now I look back and I know that my life is a twisted knot...\u2019 \u201d</p><p>OK, if they paid good money for this poetry workshop, they were done.</p><p>As I listen to the words, I\u2019m waiting for some strong, visceral reaction. I\u2019m waiting for some part of me to rise up and hate her or attack her or something. I\u2019m waiting for the big moment, the confrontation. But it\u2019s not coming. I can\u2019t get traction. I can\u2019t feel it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Since the moment I stepped through the door, this hasn\u2019t been what I thought it would be. I\u2019m not the warrior I imagined. I\u2019m hollow and vulnerable and kind of lesser. I\u2019m not winning any battle, sitting here, silently clutching the table, unable to speak, just thinking my own rapid, restless thoughts.</p><p>But more than that\u2014there isn\u2019t even any battle to have, is there? The Lawtons aren\u2019t interested in me. I could say what I like\u2014they wouldn\u2019t listen. They\u2019re playing out their little story in which Izzy apologises and she\u2019s the hero and I\u2019m the bit part. And I\u2019m letting them do it. Why am I letting them do it?</p><p>I feel a sudden wave of revulsion as I survey Izzy\u2019s bowed head.</p><p>She won\u2019t look at me, will she? She can\u2019t. Because I might pop the bubble.</p> <p>I mean, I guess that\u2019s one way to go. Slip back into being eleven years old, wear ponytails, and get homeschooled and let your parents take over and tell you everything\u2019s OK, you weren\u2019t really a bullying monster, my sweetheart. It was the nasty people who didn\u2019t understand you. But if you write a poem, everything will be OK.</p><p>Out of nowhere, Linus\u2019s voice comes into my head: Why would you even give her the time of day?</p><p>Why would I? Why am I giving her the time of day? What am I doing here?</p><p>\u201c \u2018...but bad forces come from every direction, no affection, just affliction...\u2019 \u201d</p><p>Izzy is still droning on in what seems to have become a tragically bad rap. She\u2019s got another A4 page to go, I notice. It\u2019s definitely time to leave.</p> <p>I squeeze Frank\u2019s hand and look at the door. He raises his eyebrows and I nod firmly. I even make a small, inarticulate sound.</p><p>\u201cYes, we have to go now,\u201d says Frank, cutting across Izzy. \u201cThanks for the water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo?\u201d</p><p>The Lawtons look poleaxed.</p><p>\u201cBut Izzy hasn\u2019t finished reading.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t had any discussion.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve only just begun the meeting!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d says Frank cheerfully as we both get to our feet. \u201cOK, Aud?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t leave before Izzy has even finished her piece!\u201d Mrs. Lawton sounds quite shirty. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, what kind of behaviour is this?\u201d</p><p>And then I finally find my voice. \u201cYou want to talk about behaviour?\u201d I say quietly.</p><p>It\u2019s like a magic charm. Everyone else is silenced. Paralysed.</p><p>There\u2019s an odd hush around the place\u2014it feels like the whole of Starbucks might have picked up on our vibe, just for a second. Mr. Lawton\u2019s face has kind of crumpled. It\u2019s as if reality has pushed its way through his soap bubble of denial, just for a second, and he\u2019s been forced to see exactly who I am. I\u2019m the one they did all those things to.</p><p>Yes, those things. The ones they did. And said. And wrote. Your daughter in her ponytail. That\u2019s right.</p><p>I don\u2019t look at Izzy. Why would I expend the energy that swiveling my eyeballs in her direction would require? Why would I expend even one microjoule of energy on Izzy?</p> <p>And then we\u2019re walking out, Frank and I, not looking back, not talking about it, not wasting a second more of our lives on that load of shitty, shitty crap.</p><p>And I should feel high now. Shouldn\u2019t I? I mean, I think I won. Didn\u2019t I?</p><p>Only now it\u2019s all over, I just feel kind of empty. Frank\u2019s sole comment as we walked back was \u201cWhat a bunch of weirdos.\u201d Then he told me he was heading back to school for tech club and when I gave him a big hug and muttered \u201cThanks, I don\u2019t know how I can repay you,\u201d into his shoulder, he said \u201cOK, well, I get to choose both pizza toppings on Friday night. OK?\u201d</p><p>And now it\u2019s seven o\u2019clock and I\u2019m on my own. Mum and Dad are out at their salsa class. They have no idea. I mean, how weird is that? I\u2019ve actually met up with Izzy and they don\u2019t know.</p><p>I\u2019ve texted Linus and told him about it. I\u2019ve said I\u2019m sorry I blew up at him. I\u2019ve said he was right, I should never have gone and I miss him and I want to see him so, so much. I want to go back to how we were. I want him to give me another crazy challenge. I want to forget I ever went to see Izzy.</p><p>I mean, I think we were both right. I was right because I didn\u2019t relapse and there aren\u2019t any pieces to pick up. And Linus was right because I shouldn\u2019t have given her the time of day in the first place. So. And when he texts back, I\u2019ll ask him round and maybe we\u2019ll get back to that other conversation we were having in the park.</p><p>That was two hours ago and he still hasn\u2019t texted back. I\u2019ve checked my phone signal like a million times and it\u2019s fine. Anyway.

He was right, I was selfish. I should never have gone to that stupid meeting. Why did I do it? Why? I always do stupid things. I\u2019m such a stupid, idiot failure, and now I\u2019ve spoiled the only good thing I had in my life, and he hates me and there\u2019s nothing I can do about it. The whole thing\u2019s over.

I don\u2019t understand it. I glance in the mirror and flinch at my own wild stare. I can feel a weird sparking all over my body, like I\u2019m more alive than I should be, like my body is overloaded with life force. Can you have too much life stuffed into one body? Because that\u2019s what this feels like. And everything\u2019s too fast. My heart, my thoughts, my feet, my clawing arms...</p><p>Maybe I should take something. The thought hits me like a very sensible person talking in my ear. Yes. Of course. I have things I could take. I have lots of things.</p><p>I rootle around in my box full of magic tricks, dropping bottles and packets on the floor in my haste. OK, a Clonazepam. Maybe two. Maybe three. I swallow them, and wait for everything to calm down. But my mind is still screaming, round and round like a motor race, and I can\u2019t stand it. I can\u2019t stand myself.

DAY.</p><p>The camera wobbles as someone stabilises it on a high surface. As this person backs away we see it is Frank, in the sitting room. He stares into the camera with deeply worried eyes.</p><p>FRANK</p><p>Is this working? OK. Hello. I\u2019m Frank Turner and this is my video diary. My sister Audrey is missing. It\u2019s a nightmare. We woke up this morning and there she wasn\u2019t. Mum and Dad are just...(He swallows.) We\u2019ve looked everywhere, and we\u2019ve phoned everyone. Mum and Dad called the police, like, that instant. And the police are great, they\u2019re really calm. But...</p><p>He shuts his eyes briefly.</p> <p>FRANK</p><p>I still don\u2019t believe this is happening.</p><p>He\u2019s silent a while, his eyes hollow.</p><p>FRANK</p><p>They blame me. Which is...</p><p>He exhales miserably.</p><p>FRANK</p><p>Anyway. We\u2019re going out again in a minute, to look again. I dunno where\u2014I mean, we\u2019ve looked everywhere. All the little side alleys, maybe? But Mum said I should have some food first. Like anyone wants to eat.</p> <p>He gives another heavy sigh.</p><p>FRANK</p><p>Anyway. I told them what we did yesterday. I had to. Audrey, if you\u2019re watching this, I had to.</p><p>Long pause.</p><p>FRANK</p><p>Audrey, please come home and be watching this.</p><p>The doorbell rings and he jumps a mile.</p><p>FRANK</p><p>Wait a sec.</p><p>He runs out of the room. A few seconds elapse, then he returns, slack-shouldered, accompanied by Linus.</p><p>FRANK</p><p>(into camera)</p><p>It wasn\u2019t her. It was Linus.</p><p>LINUS</p><p>(to Frank)</p><p>Sorry.</p><p>He looks awkwardly into the camera.</p><p>LINUS</p><p>Sorry.</p><p>Mum comes striding into the room, her face drawn, her eyes burning with purpose, her manner hyper.</p><p>MUM</p><p>Frank, we\u2019re going through her things, and I need to know\u2014</p><p>She sees Linus and stops dead, full of hostility.</p><p>MUM</p><p>You.

I just\u2014Frank told me about Audrey, so\u2014</p><p>MUM</p><p>Do you know where she is?</p><p>LINUS</p><p>No! Of course not! I would have said!</p><p>He gulps nervously at Mum\u2019s manner but carries on.</p><p>LINUS</p><p>Frank said you wanted to know who she\u2019d been texting?

I have to try everything, I have to consider everything, every possibility\u2014</p><p>She breaks off as Dad appears, breathless, holding his mobile.</p><p>DAD</p><p>They\u2019ve found her. In the park.</p><p>Asleep. She was hidden away,</p><p>behind a\u2014</p><p>We must have missed her\u2014</p><p>He can barely form his words.</p><p>DAD</p><p>They\u2019ve got her.</p><p>The weird thing is, I lost my sunglasses that night and I didn\u2019t even notice until Dad suddenly said, \u201cAudrey! You\u2019re not wearing your dark glasses!\u201d</p><p>And I wasn\u2019t. My eyes were bare. After all those months. And it took Dad to point it out to me.</p><p>We were in the police waiting room at the time, and the nice police woman, Sinead, got the wrong end of the stick and thought we were complaining and that we\u2019d lost a pair of dark glasses on the premises. It took a while for us to explain that I didn\u2019t want them back.</p><p>And I don\u2019t. I\u2019m good the way I am. The world seems lighter, although I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s because of the dark glasses or because I\u2019m back on my meds. For now. Dr. Sarah gave me this whole great lecture about the dangers of coming off meds without supervision and how it can cause dizziness (check) and a racing heart (check) and loads of other symptoms and I must promise never to do it again. Which I did.</p><p>The stuff she gave me kind of knocked me out, so I\u2019ve been sleeping a lot these last two days, but everyone\u2019s come into my room to see me, like, all the time. To make sure I\u2019m still here, I guess.</p><p>Dad has told me about the new song he\u2019s writing, and Frank has shown me endless YouTube clips of knife skills (which he is getting very boring about) and Felix has told me he cut the hair of his friend Ben at school and Ben cried. This is apparently true, according to Dad, but Felix maintains that Ben cried \u201cbecause he was happy.\u201d</p><p>Mum\u2019s been in to see me the most. She sat on my bed all afternoon and we watched Little Women, which is like the perfect movie to watch with your mum when you\u2019re in bed, feeling a bit weird. (The old one with Elizabeth Taylor, in case you\u2019re wondering.)</p><p>While we were watching, we decorated these handbags we\u2019d made out of felt yesterday. This is Mum\u2019s new thing: she buys little craft projects and we make them together. Neither of us is very good at it, but...you know. It\u2019s nice. It\u2019s relaxing. It\u2019s not about anything. And Mum just sits on my bed, hanging out, not looking anxiously around the room, not trying to get clues to my thoughts. I don\u2019t think she needs clues anymore. She knows. Or at least, she knows enough.</p><p>It was while I was trying to glue an appliqu\u00e9 star onto the front of my bag that I said, \u201cMum, why don\u2019t you go back to work?\u201d</p><p>Mum kind of stiffened. She carefully looped a piece of ribbon into a bow and stapled it before looking up and saying, \u201cWork?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, work. You haven\u2019t been for ages. Not since...\u201d I trailed off.</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s been difficult.\u201d Mum gave a short laugh.</p><p>\u201cI know. But you\u2019re brilliant at your job. And you win prizes and you wear great jackets...\u201d</p><p>Mum threw back her head and laughed again. \u201cDarling, you don\u2019t go to work just to wear great jackets.\u201d She thinks for a moment. \u201cWell, most of the time you don\u2019t.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re staying at home because of me, aren\u2019t you?\u201d I persisted.</p><p>\u201cSweetheart...\u201d Mum sighed. \u201cI love being here with you. I wouldn\u2019t want to be anywhere else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>There was silence and we watched as Jo turned down Laurie\u2019s proposal, which, every time I watch it, I wish she would say yes.</p> <p>\u201cBut still, I think you should go back to work,\u201d I said. \u201cYou\u2019re all shiny when you\u2019re at work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShiny?\u201d Mum seemed a bit taken aback.</p><p>\u201cShiny. Like, super-mum.\u201d</p><p>Mum looked incredibly touched. She blinked a few times and threaded another ribbon through the bow, and then said,</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not as simple as that, Audrey. I might have to travel, there are long hours, you\u2019re starting a new school...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo we\u2019ll make it work,\u201d I said, as robustly as I could. \u201cMum, there\u2019s no point me getting better if things don\u2019t get better for all of us. I mean, we\u2019ve all had a bad time, haven\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d been thinking about that all morning. About how it would be easy for me to get better and spring happily through the door, and leave Mum and Dad and Frank and Felix behind. But it shouldn\u2019t be like that. We were all affected by what happened. We should all spring happily out of the door together.</p><p>Well, you know. Maybe Frank could slouch happily.</p><p>We watched for a while more in silence. Then Mum said, as though she was carrying on the same conversation,</p><p>\u201cDr. Sarah told me why you ditched your meds. You wanted to have a straight graph?\u201d</p><p>My heart kind of sank. I had really not wanted to get onto the subject of meds. But I might have known it would come up.</p> <p>\u201cI wanted to be better,\u201d I mumbled, feeling hot. \u201cYou know. Properly, one hundred percent better. No meds, nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are better.\u201d Mum put my face between her hands, just like she used to when I was a little girl. \u201cSweetheart, you\u2019re so much better every week. I mean, you\u2019re a different girl. You\u2019re ninety percent there. Ninety-five percent. You must be able to see that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m sick of this bloody jagged graph,\u201d I said in frustration. \u201cYou know, two steps up, one step down. It\u2019s so painful. It\u2019s so slow. It\u2019s like this endless game of snakes and ladders.\u201d</p><p>And Mum just looked at me as if she wanted to laugh or maybe cry, and she said, \u201cBut, Audrey, that\u2019s what life is. We\u2019re all on a jagged graph. I know I am. Up a bit, down a bit. That\u2019s life.\u201d</p><p>And then Jo met Professor Bhaer, so we had to watch that bit.</p><p>And then Beth died. So I guess the March sisters were on their own jagged graph too.</p><p>That night I come downstairs for a cup of hot chocolate and hear Dad saying, \u201cAnne, I\u2019ve ordered Frank a new laptop. There. I\u2019ve said it. It\u2019s done.\u201d</p><p>Wow.</p> <p>I creep forward and peer through the open door to see Mum almost drop her mug.</p><p>\u201cA new laptop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSecondhand. Excellent price. I went to Paul Taylor, he has some good deals\u2014\u201d Dad breaks off at Mum\u2019s expression. \u201cAnne, OK. I know what we said. I know. But I can\u2019t cope with the tension in this house anymore. And Frank\u2019s right, he does need the Internet for his schoolwork, and he can hack into my emails, as we now know...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you just went and did it.\u201d</p><p>Mum is shaking her head, but she doesn\u2019t sound quite as shrieky as I was expecting. In fact, she seems almost calm.</p><p>It\u2019s eerie. I\u2019m not sure I like Mum calm. She\u2019s better all mad and voluble.</p><p>\u201cIs it so bad for Frank to play computer games once in a while?\u201d ventures Dad.</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know, Chris.\u201d Mum rubs her face. \u201cI don\u2019t know anymore. About anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, nor do I.\u201d He pulls her in for a hug. \u201cAnyway, I\u2019ve got him a laptop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK.\u201d Mum kind of subsides onto Dad and I can see how tired out she is. Frank said he\u2019s never seen Mum like she was when I was missing. She was kind of grey, he said. And her eyes were flat inside, like their battery had died.</p><p>I\u2019ll never get over doing that to them. But I\u2019m not brooding. I\u2019ve talked to Dr. Sarah about it and we\u2019ve agreed that the best way I can make it up to them is to stay well. Stay on my meds. Think healthful thoughts.</p><p>\u201cYou remember that Christmas when they got ill?\u201d Mum says presently. \u201cThe year they were about two and three? Remember? And got poo all over their Christmas stockings, and it was everywhere, and we said, \u2018It has to get easier than this\u2019?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were cleaning it all up and we kept saying to each other, \u2018When they get older, it\u2019ll get easier.\u2019 Remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d Dad looks fondly at her.</p><p>\u201cWell, bring back the poo.\u201d Mum begins to laugh, a bit hysterically. \u201cI would do anything for a bit of poo right now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI dream of poo,\u201d says Dad firmly, and Mum laughs even more, till she\u2019s wiping tears from her eyes.</p><p>And I back away, without making a sound. I\u2019ll get my hot chocolate later.</p><p>And so the only piece left in the jigsaw is Linus. But it\u2019s a big piece.</p><p>Frank just showed me the footage of Mum laying into Linus in the sitting room and I stared in total disbelief. First, I couldn\u2019t believe Mum could blame Linus for anything, Second, I couldn\u2019t believe he\u2019d only just got my text. Third, I couldn\u2019t believe he\u2019d come over to see me.</p><p>So he hadn\u2019t given up on me. He didn\u2019t hate me. I hadn\u2019t spoiled everything. I\u2019d been wrong on pretty much everything. As I watched it for the second time I felt pretty sheepish, and I could tell Mum felt even worse.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t sound like that,\u201d she kept saying in horror. \u201cI didn\u2019t say that. Did I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou totally sound like that,\u201d said Frank. \u201cYou sound worse, actually. The camera was flattering.\u201d</p><p>He was rubbing it in. She doesn\u2019t sound quite as shrill as that in real life.</p><p>\u201cSo, I need to apologise to Linus.\u201d She sighs.</p><p>\u201cSo do I,\u201d I say quickly.</p><p>\u201cSo do I,\u201d says Frank glumly.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Mum and I swivel to look at him.</p><p>\u201cWe had a fight. About LOC. He was talking about the tournament and I got...well, jealous, I suppose.\u201d</p><p>Frank looks like an overgrown schoolboy. He\u2019s got ink on his hands and is staring miserably at his knees. He doesn\u2019t know about the laptop yet, and I would love to whisper it in his ear to cheer him up, but I\u2019ve had enough of going behind my parents\u2019 backs. For now.</p><p>\u201cSo.\u201d Mum is back into her brisk mode again. \u201cWe all need to apologise to Linus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMum, that\u2019s all very well,\u201d I say in a flat tone. \u201cBut it\u2019s too late. Linus\u2019s parents are emigrating. He\u2019s at the airport right now. We\u2019ve missed our chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Mum looks up as though scalded.</p><p>\u201cWe could make the airport.\u201d Dad looks alertly at his watch. \u201cWhich airport? Anne, we\u2019ll take your car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich flight?\u201d demands Mum. \u201cAudrey, which flight?\u201d</p> <p>What are my parents like? They\u2019ve watched too many Richard Curtis films, that\u2019s their trouble. They\u2019ve gone soft in the head.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not at the bloody airport!\u201d I expostulate. \u201cI said that as a joke. Don\u2019t you think you\u2019d know if Linus was emigrating?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Mum subsides, looking highly embarrassed. \u201cOK. I just got carried away for a moment. What shall we do, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cInvite him to Starbucks,\u201d I say after a moment\u2019s thought. \u201cIt needs to be at Starbucks. Frank, you text him.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s actually pretty funny. When Linus arrives at Starbucks, we\u2019re all sitting there at one big table, the whole family, waiting for him. He looks totally unnerved, and for a moment I think he\u2019s going to run away, but you know, Linus isn\u2019t a runner-awayer. After about five seconds he comes forward resolutely and looks at us all in turn, especially Mum. And last of all me.</p><p>It takes him about thirty seconds to realize.</p><p>\u201cYour glasses!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I can\u2019t help beaming.</p><p>\u201cWhen\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDunno. They just fell off. And...here I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, Linus,\u201d says Mum. \u201cWe would all like to apologise to you. Frank?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry I got ratty, mate,\u201d says Frank, turning red.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Linus seems embarrassed. \u201cEr...that\u2019s OK.\u201d</p><p>They bang fists together then Frank turns to Mum.</p><p>\u201cMum, your turn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK.\u201d Mum clears her throat. \u201cLinus, I\u2019m very sorry I took my worries and fears out on you. I got completely the wrong end of the stick. I know how good you\u2019ve been for Audrey and I can only apologise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Um.\u201d Linus looks even more embarrassed. \u201cListen, you don\u2019t have to do this,\u201d he says, looking around the family. \u201cI know you were all stressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe want to.\u201d Mum\u2019s voice gives a sudden waver. \u201cLinus, we\u2019re all very fond of you. And I should not have shouted at you. It was a bad time, and I really am sorry.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSorry!\u201d chimes in Felix, who has been chomping on shortbread biscuits all this time. \u201cWe have to say sorry to Linus.

Understood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnderstood,\u201d says Linus with a little smile.</p> <p>\u201cAnd, Linus, we\u2019d like to give you a little present to make amends,\u201d says Mum. \u201cA little gift. Maybe a theatre outing...or a theme park? You choose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can choose anything?\u201d Linus looks secretively from Mum to Dad. \u201cAnything I want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, within reason! Nothing too expensive...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis wouldn\u2019t be expensive, what I\u2019m thinking of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sounds great!\u201d says Dad at once, and Mum frowns at him.</p><p>\u201cI want to play in the LOC qualifiers with Frank,\u201d says Linus. \u201cThat\u2019s what I want more than anything.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh.\u201d Mum stares at him, discomfited. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in a team already,\u201d says Frank gruffly. I can tell he\u2019s super-touched from the way he won\u2019t even look at Linus.</p><p>\u201cI want to play in your team. They\u2019ve got a reserve. They don\u2019t need me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we haven\u2019t got a team!\u201d says Frank, and there\u2019s a sudden depth of misery to his voice. \u201cI haven\u2019t got a computer, we don\u2019t have a team\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet,\u201d chimes in Dad, bubbling over. \u201cYet.\u201d He grins madly at Frank. \u201cYet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Frank stares blankly at him.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t got a computer yet.\u201d Dad gives one of his stage winks. \u201cJust look out for a big brown box, is all I\u2019m saying. But no more hacking my emails.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Frank looks almost heady with hope. \u201cSeriously?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf you follow our rules and don\u2019t make a fuss when we tell you to stop playing,\u201d says Mum. \u201cIf there\u2019s any trouble, it\u2019s going out of the window.\u201d She gives a satisfied little grin. \u201cYou know I\u2019ll do it. You know I want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything!\u201d Frank seems almost beyond speechless. \u201cI\u2019ll do anything!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you can play in your game,\u201d says Dad, who looks almost as fired up by this as Frank. \u201cI was reading a piece about it in the Sunday Times magazine. I mean, this LOC is a big business, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d says Frank, as if to say Finally! \u201cIn Korea it\u2019s an official spectator sport! And they have scholarships for it in the States. Actual scholarships.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should read the piece, Anne,\u201d says Dad. \u201cWhat\u2019s the prize pot, six million dollars?\u201d He grins at Frank. \u201cSo, are you going to win that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have a team.\u201d Frank suddenly deflates. \u201cWe\u2019ll never get a team together. It\u2019s, like, a week away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOllie could play,\u201d suggests Linus. \u201cHe\u2019s not bad, for a twelve-year-old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could play,\u201d I offer, on impulse. \u201cYou know, if you want me to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou?\u201d says Frank derisively. \u201cYou\u2019re crap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I can practice, can\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly!\u201d says Mum. \u201cShe can practice. So, that\u2019s sorted.\u201d She glances at her watch, then at Linus and me. \u201cAnd now we\u2019ll leave you two alone, for Audrey to...Well, for you to...\u201d She pauses. \u201cAnyway. You don\u2019t want us hanging around embarrassing you!\u201d</p><p>OK, the thing is, no-one was embarrassed till she said the word embarrassed. As it is, Linus and I wait in awkward silence while they all get up and Felix drops his biscuit and wants another one, and Dad starts looking for his BlackBerry and Mum tells him he didn\u2019t have it, and honestly, I love them to bits, but could my family be any more annoying?</p><p>I wait until they\u2019ve well and truly left and the glass door has closed behind them. And then I turn properly to Linus and look at him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWelcome to my eyes,\u201d I say softly. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like them.\u201d He smiles. \u201cI love them.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019re just looking and looking at each other.

I\u2019ve said it. Enough.\u201d</p><p>He has a point. We\u2019ve sent about five zillion texts to each other since I came back.

You\u2019re desperate to see it. Especially the elephants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK. I\u2019ll do it.\u201d I get up and do a mock curtsey. \u201cLook, no glasses! Just eyes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He looks up, smiling. \u201cI told you, I love them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou love them?\u201d I preen myself.</p> <p>\u201cYou.\u201d</p><p>Something catches in my throat.

We\u2019re like starving people gorging on cream cakes. But he\u2019s challenged me, and I\u2019m not going to wuss out, no way. So I wrench myself away and go to pester a strange blond woman about the circus. I don\u2019t look back once, the entire time I\u2019m talking to her. But I can feel his eyes on me all the time. Like sunshine.</p><p>Mum\u2019s printed us T-shirts. She\u2019s actually printed us team T-shirts. We\u2019re called The Strategists, which got pulled out of a hat when we couldn\u2019t agree on a name.</p><p>You wouldn\u2019t believe the playroom. It looks like Gaming Central. Ollie and Linus brought their stuff over yesterday, so now there are two desktops (Dad\u2019s, which he\u2019s lending to me for the match, and Ollie\u2019s) and two laptops, each with a chair and a headset and a bottle of water so we stay hydrated. And\u2014last-minute purchase by Mum\u2014a box of Krispy Kremes.</p><p>I mean, we could all play online in our own homes. That would be the normal thing. But Mum was like, \u201cOK, if this is a team sport, play it like a team sport.\u201d And it\u2019s a Saturday morning, so actually it works fine.</p><p>Mum\u2019s suddenly become interested in LOC, for the first time in her life, and we\u2019ve spent all week explaining the characters and the levels and the backstory and answering her dumb questions, like \u201cBut why does everyone have to be so greedy and violent?\u201d In the end, Frank snapped, \u201cIt\u2019s Land of Conquerors, Mum, not Land of Community Service Volunteers,\u201d and she did look a bit embarrassed.</p> <p>I\u2019ve put in a few hours online and I\u2019ve sharpened up my game a little. I mean, I\u2019m no Frank. But I won\u2019t let them down. I hope. Actually, I think I\u2019m a little better than Ollie, who asked me at our first practice session if I was dating Linus and when I said \u201cYes,\u201d looked deflated for about thirty seconds, then said, manfully, \u201cWell, let\u2019s just be good friends and teammates, then.\u201d He is quite a cutie, old Ollie.</p><p>\u201cI bought some Cokes for the team!\u201d Dad arrives at the door of the playroom.</p><p>\u201cChris!\u201d Mum frowns. \u201cI got them water!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne Coke won\u2019t hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God. Look at this.\u201d Mum is peering round the room as though for the first time. \u201cLook at this room. Coke? Krispy Kremes? Computers?\u201d It\u2019s like the triumvirate of all the things she despises and fears. I feel quite sorry for her. \u201cAre we bad parents?\u201d She turns to Dad. \u201cSeriously. Are we bad parents?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d He shrugs. \u201cProbably.

Listen, The children are teased at school, but Christy Gorringe, thirty-two, is unrepentant. \u2018I like my kids to match,\u2019 she says. \u2018I buy my fabric wholesale.\u2019\u201d Mum shakes her head in disbelief. \u201cHave you seen them?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She turns the paper round so we can see a lineup of six miserable kids, all in matching spotted shirts.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s made my day!\u201d Mum hastily adjusts her expression. \u201cI mean, poor kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoor kids.\u201d Dad nods.</p><p>\u201cBut at least we\u2019re not as bad as that.\u201d She hits the paper. \u201cAt least I don\u2019t make my children wear vile matching clothes.

DAY.</p><p>The camera (held by Dad) shows the playroom littered with empty Coke cans and water bottles.</p><p>Seen from behind, Frank, OLLIE, Linus, and Audrey are playing LOC intensely. Mum is looking from screen to screen, peering over their shoulders and trying to follow, without success.</p> <p>FRANK</p><p>Go on him. Jesus.</p><p>He clicks madly and his screen explodes in graphics.</p><p>MUM</p><p>(alertly)</p><p>What was that? Which one\u2019s you?</p> <p>LINUS</p><p>Initiate. Initiate.</p><p>AUDREY</p><p>Stay in the trees. Nooo!

What happens when you die? How can you keep up?</p><p>FRANK</p><p>Fireblast the fucker. Die! Die!</p><p>MUM</p><p>(shocked)</p><p>Frank!</p><p>A series of Russian swearing comes from the audio Skype link.</p><p>FRANK</p><p>Na kaleni, cyka.</p><p>MUM</p><p>What does that mean? Is that in the game?</p><p>LINUS</p><p>It\u2019s Russian. You don\u2019t want to know what it means.</p><p>MUM</p><p>So is that chap a Russian? Or is that you, Frank?</p><p>She points at the screen.</p><p>MUM</p><p>I mean, they all look the same to me. Do they look the same to you, Chris?</p><p>The camera (held by Dad) focuses in on a screen.</p><p>DAD (VOICE-OVER)</p><p>Of course they\u2019re not the same. Die! Die!</p><p>We didn\u2019t win. Not only did we not win, we were stomped.</p><p>Mum was genuinely shocked. I think she\u2019d mentally checked us in for the finals in Toronto and the six-million-dollar prize pot, with her lording it over all the other parents.</p><p>\u201cSo, how did they beat you?\u201d she said in astonishment when we\u2019d finally got it through to her.</p><p>\u201cThey played better,\u201d said Frank despondently. \u201cThey were really good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re really good too,\u201d says Mum at once. \u201cYou killed loads of people.

She\u2019s now behaving as though the only thing she rates in life is LOC.</p><p>\u201cAnyone want the last Krispy Kreme?\u201d she says, and we all shake our heads. It\u2019s a pretty sad atmosphere in here, what with the silent computers and the Coke cans and the air of defeat, and I think Mum realizes this.</p><p>\u201cWell, anyway!\u201d she says brightly. \u201cWe\u2019ll go out for a team lunch to celebrate the taking part. Pizza Express, everyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool.\u201d Frank takes off his headset and switches off his laptop. \u201cAnd then I might go in to the Fox and Hounds,\u201d he says casually. \u201cAde said I could help in the kitchen or whatever at weekends. I need to talk to the head chef. I\u2019ll give Ade a ring now, sort it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Mum looks a bit flummoxed. \u201cWell...OK, Frank. Good idea!\u201d As he lopes out of the room, she turns to Dad, her jaw sagging. \u201cDid I hear that right? Is Frank getting himself a job?\u201d</p><p>But Dad can\u2019t hear. He\u2019s put on one of the headsets and is logged into another LOC game with Ollie.</p><p>\u201cDad, can you play?\u201d I say in surprise.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019ve picked up a bit,\u201d he says, and clicks furiously. \u201cHere and there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut who are you playing with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA couple of friends from school,\u201d says Ollie, who is equally engrossed. \u201cThey were online, so...Go on him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on it,\u201d says Dad breathlessly. \u201cOh, shit. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>Mum is staring at Dad, flabbergasted. \u201cChris, what are you doing?\u201d She pokes his shoulder. \u201cChris! I\u2019m talking to you! Did you hear what I said about Frank?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Dad pulls off the headset for a moment. \u201cYes. I heard. Ground him.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help giggling, and even Mum gives a little smile.</p><p>\u201cGet back to the game, you big kid,\u201d she says. \u201cBut we\u2019re going out in half an hour, OK? Half an hour. And I don\u2019t care if you have to interrupt the game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK,\u201d says Dad, sounding just like Frank. \u201cGreat. Yeah. Can\u2019t wait.\u201d He clicks madly, then punches the air as the screen explodes in colour. \u201cDie, you bastard! Die!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Always and Forever, Lara Jean (To All the Boys I've Loved Before #3)</p>  </body></html>"]
