I was trying to enjoy basking in the Miami sun, but I was still a little sore. It had been over a month now since I\u2019d sustained my injuries. I was fit enough to work now, but I still got occasional reminders of what had happened to me when I moved or breathed just wrong.</p><p>My phone chimed that I had a new text message, and I winced again. I needed to remember to keep it in the off position. It helped me to delay the inevitable. I reached down to the concrete below my pool lounge chair, gripped my phone, and held down the off button until it powered off.</p><p>Just seconds later, I heard the Kings of Leon song that served as Stephan\u2019s ringtone begin to play. He sighed heavily from his lounge chair beside me, then rose, heading into the hotel bar that was nearest the pool. If I hadn\u2019t been sure my text was from James, I was now. It was his pattern lately. He would call Stephan after failing to get ahold of me. And for some odd reason, Stephan felt obliged to answer his calls. It had been the cause of an unusual new tension that had sprung up between us.</p> <p>A different figure loomed over me a moment later, casting a shadow as it hovered near the seat that Stephan had just vacated.</p><p>\u201cMind if I join you, Bee?\u201d Damien asked in his heavy Australian accent. I didn\u2019t open my eyes from behind my dark shades, but I recognized his voice easily enough.</p><p>I made a humming noise that meant I didn\u2019t care, and he lounged beside me.</p><p>Stephan and I had had to call in several big favors from another crew to get to Miami for our layover.</p><p>But I had wanted so desperately to avoid New York this week that Stephan had made it happen.</p> <p>Somehow Captain Damien and First Officer Murphy had managed to do the same, after Stephan had casually mentioned in a text that we would be missing our New York trip for the week. At first, I\u2019d thought it was rather stalker-ish of them, but more and more, the two men were growing on me. Damien had made no overtures. He was, in fact, great company for a person who just wanted some peace and quiet. He had no problem being comfortably silent, occasionally making light-hearted comments that drew me out of my black moods. And he was accompanied by Murphy more often than not. Murphy could make anyone laugh. Even me in the depressed mood that was dogging me lately.</p><p>\u201cThat cover-up is gonna give you an interesting tan line,\u201d Damien said in an amused tone.</p><p>I wore a black swimsuit coverup that went to the top of my thighs. I wore it over my plain black bikini.</p><p>The coverup was see-through, but it was just dark enough to mostly obscure the faint traces of bruises that still patterned my torso in a stark reminder of the violence I\u2019d survived just weeks ago. They had faded considerably, but they were still dark enough to need covering. I would draw unwanted attention if I bared my skin for all to see. I\u2019d already gotten enough unwanted attention lately. The paparazzi would take any excuse to make me a headline nowadays. I wasn\u2019t in any mood to encourage them.</p><p>\u201cNo one wants to see what\u2019s under this cover-up. Trust me,\u201d I told him, still not opening my eyes or even twitching.</p><p>He coughed back a little laugh that made me uncomfortable. I was perceptive enough to know that Damien was more than a little interested in me in a romantic way. Any reminders of the fact were unwelcome.</p> <p>\u201cI beg to differ,\u201d he said quietly, and I felt myself frown.</p><p>\u201cSorry, sorry,\u201d he said quickly, before I could speak. I let it go. As long as he knew I wasn\u2019t interested in anything beyond friendship, I was content to let sleeping dogs lie.</p><p>Damien was handsome and funny and great company. He was also a shameless womanizer. I figured it was just second nature to him to try to to show interest in any woman in his vicinity. And it was also in his nature to flatter any woman when given an opening. I was usually more careful about giving him that opening.</p><p>\u201cIs everything okay between you and Stephan? I\u2019ve never seen you guys like this before. You\u2019re so stiff with each other. Are you fighting?\u201d</p><p>My gut clenched. Things did seem off between us, and I wasn\u2019t sure how to make it better. I figured he had to be at least a little resentful of me for making him miss his week\u2019s worth of Melvin time this week.</p><p>Not that I had actually made him. I had told him more than once that I would understand if he still wanted to go to New York. The crew we had traded with had even agreed to just do a single trade with me. But Stephan had insisted we stick together. He was worried about me, I knew.</p><p>I liked Damien. I even thought of him as a friend. One of my few pilot friends. But I couldn\u2019t imagine discussing my difficulties with Stephan with anyone. It felt almost disloyal.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s just worried about me, I think. Since the attack, we\u2019ve both been on edge,\u201d I explained. It was all true, but didn\u2019t address the reason for our awkwardness.</p> <p>Damien made a neutral little hum in his throat. \u201cWhat about that James guy? You two doing okay? I saw a little bit of the media circus that surrounds him. You get tired of all that, and drop him? You could have any man you want, you know.\u201d</p><p>I sucked in a breath. Damien was usually very good about not asking questions like that. It was why he had made good company lately.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it,\u201d I said, my tone cool.</p><p>He got the hint. \u201cDamn, sorry. I\u2019m on a roll, putting my foot in my mouth, aren\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>I gave a half-smile, finally looking at him. I gave a little nod, and he laughed.</p><p>\u201cWell, I guess I owe you now. You want to ask me any rude, prying questions about my personal life?\u201d</p><p>he asked. He had a great smile. It was all even white teeth, and self-deprecating humor. It would have been hard not to smile back. I didn\u2019t even try.</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d I told him with no hesitation.</p><p>He laughed again, as though I was much more funny than I actually was. \u201cI guess when you answer yes to that question, I\u2019ll know I have you where I want you.\u201d</p><p>I just wrinkled my nose and turned my face away.</p><p>\u201cWanna take a walk on the beach?\u201d he asked, after several minutes of silence.</p><p>I realized in surprise that I did want to get up and move around a bit. I\u2019d been so inactive lately, due to my injuries. \u201cIt\u2019s not a romantic stroll or anything, is it?\u201d I asked him cautiously.</p><p>He sat up, grinning at me. He really was a good-looking man. He wore only low-slung black swim trunks. He was tan and muscular. His dark hair and warm brown eyes were hollywood material. I really didn\u2019t understand why he would put so much time into a passably attractive girl who wasn\u2019t even remotely interested in him. I tried to use that characterization as further proof that he was just being friendly, still strangely uncomfortable with his company.</p><p>I got up, moving slowly. I was still stiff, though I had recovered remarkably well, all things considered.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t been released from the hospital until I\u2019d had countless tests run, so I was in the clear of any serious injuries.</p><p>I started walking, and Damien fell into step beside me. He seemed to know better than to try to help me.</p><p>I found the wooden crosswalk that led from our hotel to the beach, and crossed it resolutely.</p><p>I walked almost to the water line before I began to walk along the beach. My bare feet got wet, but it felt good after laying in the hot sun. I even got a few steps deeper into the tide before I began to follow the shoreline, passing the various ocean-front hotels. I counted the hotels we passed, absently keeping track.</p><p>\u201cSome weirdo just got a picture of us,\u201d Damien told me as we walked.</p><p>Inwardly, I cursed. Outwardly, I shrugged.</p><p>\u201cWant me to go beat him up and take his camera?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I laughed. \u201cThe damage is done,\u201d I said. I could only imagine what they would print about me this week. I figured no matter what it was, it couldn\u2019t be worse than the tangent they had gone on a month ago.</p><p>They had called me every derogatory name in the book. I was becoming quickly immune to it. It was almost a pleasant surprise to me, how quickly I was becoming desensitized to being publicly insulted.</p><p>Someday I might even stifle my unhealthy urge to check online for what they were saying about me. I wasn\u2019t sure I\u2019d ever have enough self-control to keep from checking to see what they were saying about James...</p><p>\u201cAre you really done with that James Cavendish guy, or are you just taking a break?\u201d Damien asked, walking close to my side, as though afraid I would lose my balance. He probably wasn\u2019t totally wrong. I did feel a little wobbly, but it was mostly because I was so stiff.</p><p>I gave him a level stare. I decided to be brutally honest with him. \u201cI\u2019d like to think I\u2019m sensible enough to be done with him. I\u2019m realistic enough to know that, done or not, I\u2019m ruined for other men. If you must know, he and I have certain...tastes in common. I don\u2019t really care to discuss it any more than that.\u201d</p><p>Damien touched my arm briefly, giving me a warm smile when I looked at him. \u201cIf you\u2019re a dominatrix, Bee, I can live with that. Feel free to tie me up and spank me, anytime you feel the need.\u201d</p><p>I laughed, because he was joking, and because it was the opposite of the truth.</p><p>\u201cUm, no,\u201d was all I said to him.</p><p>\u201cAre you in love with him?\u201d he asked. \u201cIs it that serious? You can tell me, Bianca. I won\u2019t judge. I just want to be your friend.\u201d</p><p>I grimaced. He was my friend. Why is it so hard for me to open up? I wondered. Even to a friend. I thought over the question, trying to suppress my natural urge to just close up at such a personal topic.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I answered finally. \u201cIt\u2019s hopeless, I know. Maybe that\u2019s why my heart was perverse enough to give itself. But I do love him.\u201d</p><p>He squeezed my elbow. \u201cHey, I know the feeling. Don\u2019t beat yourself up so much. What will you do?\u201d</p><p>I took a few deep breaths, really thinking about it. \u201cThat\u2019s what I don\u2019t know. I can\u2019t deny how I feel, but I can deny where it has to lead. He still wants me. Will I let him have me again? That\u2019s the million dollar question, I suppose.\u201d</p><p>Damien gave me a pained look. \u201cIt is.\u201d</p><p>I gave a small shrug, the one I couldn\u2019t seem to help. It was a gesture that seemed to drive everyone in my life insane.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll grow tired of me, I\u2019m sure,\u201d I said softly. \u201cIt\u2019s his M.O. The question is, am I so desperate for him that I\u2019ll just sign on for the ride?\u201d</p><p>Damien didn\u2019t have an answer for that. Neither did I.</p><p>CHAPTER TWO</p><p>Damien and I walked slowly back to the hotel. We found more neutral topics to chat about on the return trip.</p><p>I noticed this time when my picture was taken by the man who crouched in the bushes outside of the hotel that bordered our own. He was a pudgy, balding man. I had the urge to tell him that he didn\u2019t need to bother damaging his knees by attempting to hide. He was very visible, even hiding.</p><p>I made myself ignore him instead. His publication would say something horrible about me either way, I was sure.</p><p>\u201cWanna hit up that Cuban restaurant on the corner?\u201d Damien asked. We were almost back to our hotel.</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cLet\u2019s see what Stephan wants to do,\u201d I said neutrally. The food sounded good, but I didn\u2019t want to end up going to dinner with just Damien. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOkay. We\u2019ll make it a foursome. Murphy will no doubt have an opinion on where to eat,\u201d Damien said cheerfully. His attitude reassured me. I\u2019d been half-worried he was trying to corner me into some kind of a date.</p><p>We found the other two men chatting with each other in our crew hotel\u2019s large, crowded bar. Everyone agreed on the Cuban restaurant easily enough. It did have killer food.</p><p>We split up to change for dinner, meeting back in the lobby twenty minutes later. I just threw on some shorts and a tank top.</p><p>We walked to the restaurant, the men joking constantly, making me laugh. They really were good company.</p> <p>I ordered black bean soup and rice at the restaurant. It was a simple, if fattening, meal. I didn\u2019t care. It was my version of comfort food. I gorged myself, as I rarely did. I even ordered a second order of the meal to go. It was a great breakfast, if you added orange juice. I did, grabbing a carton from the mini- mart a block away from the hotel.</p><p>Stephan carried everything for me without a word. Awkward as it was between us, he was still a gentleman to his core. His unusual mormon upbringing had ingrained in him a need to shelter me that I\u2019d never been able to talk him out of. I accepted him too much to even try at this point. I just thanked him when he unburdened me of the bags.</p><p>Unexpectedly, he gripped my hand as we walked. I squeezed his hand back instantly. I couldn\u2019t stand distance between us.</p><p>\u201cAre you mad at me?\u201d I asked him. We walked just a few feet in front of Murphy and Damien, so I pitched my voice very low.</p><p>He sent me a wide-eyed, surprised look. \u201cOf course not, Buttercup. I\u2019m terrified that you\u2019re angry with me for keeping in contact with James.\u201d</p> <p>I squeezed his hand again. \u201cNo. I understand very well how hard it is to ignore that man. He is persistent. I was just worried that you were mad at me for keeping you away from Melvin this week.\u201d</p><p>His mouth tightened. \u201cNot at all. I\u2019ve come to realize that Melvin isn\u2019t relationship material. He admitted to hooking up with another guy last week, even though we had said we were going to take it slow, but be exclusive. And I also think he tried to talk to the press about you and I. I feel bad that my judgement was so off about him. I was so attracted at first that I just saw what I wanted to see. You know what I mean?\u201d</p><p>I cringed. \u201cSadly, I know exactly what you mean,\u201d I said, thinking of James.</p><p>He shook his head, giving my hand a little squeeze. \u201cJames isn\u2019t the same as Melvin, Bee. I\u2019m sure of it. I just wish you could see it, too.\u201d</p><p>I just gave him a look. It was my \u2018drop it\u2019 look.</p><p>Murphy and Damien wanted to go bar hopping on South Beach.</p> <p>I declined their invitation quickly. Stephan followed suit. Murphy turned to his phone, texting the rest of our crew. We had seen the three other flight attendants at the pool briefly earlier, but they seemed to be a room-bound lot for the evening. Murphy looked crestfallen. An antisocial crew was his worst nightmare.</p><p>\u201cA movie? There\u2019s a theatre less than ten minutes away.\u201d</p><p>Stephan sent me a questioning look.</p><p>I just shrugged. What I wanted was to go to my room and crawl under my covers until morning, but I knew I would just drive myself crazy if I went that route. A movie seemed the lesser evil.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Just let me a grab a sweatshirt. I always get cold in that theatre,\u201d I agreed finally.</p><p>My room was down the hall from Stephan\u2019s. Unfortunately, the hotel hadn\u2019t been able to accommodate us with adjoining rooms, as we preferred.</p><p>He handed me my bags of food and juice as we split up. I put the food in my mini-fridge, and grabbed a sweatshirt from my suitcase.</p><p>I set my phone on the end table by my bed, plugging it in to charge. Reluctantly, I turned it on. I was just intending to set my alarm for the morning, then leave the phone in my room, charging.</p> <p>There were several missed texts and calls. There always were, lately. Most were from James, of course, though a few were from other friends, and a few were from a strange Vegas 702 number that kept popping up lately. I wondered briefly who that strange number could be, as it kept showing up more and more in my missed call log. I\u2019d even taken the call once, though there\u2019d just been a few seconds of background noise followed by an abrupt hangup.</p><p>My mind changed courses when, in a sudden total loss of self-control, I checked my latest missed text. I wasn\u2019t at all surprised to see that it was from James, but my heart still skipped a beat just seeing his name.</p><p>James: Just checking in to see how you\u2019re doing. I miss you.</p><p>I was texting back before I could stop myself.</p><p>Bianca: Doing fine. Please stop worrying about me. Just hanging out with the crew. Hope things are well with you.</p><p>He responded immediately.</p><p>James: Well enough. I\u2019ll be in London for most of next week, so please don\u2019t skip out on New York again just to avoid me. When can I see you again?</p><p>My heart ached with longing at just the thought of seeing him, but my heart wasn\u2019t doing a good job of steering me in the right direction lately.</p><p>Bianca: I need more time. I\u2019m sorry. I just seem to lose all self-control when I get near you. I need to get myself grounded again.</p><p>James: We can meet however you want. You make the terms. I would agree to anything, just to see you for five minutes. I mean that literally. I could meet up with your crew or we could meet up for coffee. Just tell me what you want and I\u2019ll do it. I\u2019m desperate to see you.</p><p>I swallowed, feeling at sea. How I wanted to see him, even if only for five minutes. I should be able to control myself, if it were only five minutes... Bianca: Let me think about it. You know my schedule. Let me know when we\u2019re in the same city and I\u2019ll try to find a brief, neutral way that we can meet up.</p><p>James: Don\u2019t tempt me so, Love. I\u2019ll be on a plane in thirty minutes if you really mean that.</p><p>My gut clenched.</p><p>Bianca: Don\u2019t do that. I meant if your schedule takes you to the same city. Please don\u2019t travel on my account.</p><p>James: I need to take a business trip to Vegas soon. I\u2019d like to see you when I\u2019m there. Tell me the time and place and I\u2019ll work my schedule around it.</p><p>Bianca: Stephan and I are meeting up with some friends a week from monday. We haven\u2019t decided on a time or place, but I\u2019ll let you know when we do. You can join us if you want.</p><p>James: I very much want. Give me the details when you have them. I\u2019ll count the days, my love.</p><p>I turned my phone off after that.</p><p>We all met back up in the lobby. I was the last to arrive. I felt bad that I had made them all wait, but no one seemed to mind.</p><p>They were having a good-natured argument about whether we should walk or share a taxi.</p><p>I wrinkled my nose at Murphy, who seemed to think it was worth it to take a taxi the short distance.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s less than a mile,\u201d I told him. \u201cIt\u2019s a waste of money. Especially since it\u2019s so nice out.\u201d</p><p>Damien poked Murphy\u2019s oversized belly. \u201cIt seems like you could use a walk, mate.\u201d</p><p>Murphy poked Damien\u2019s belly. \u201cDon\u2019t foist your body image issues on me, mate. I\u2019m sexy. When I want a six pack, I go to the liquor store. It\u2019s a hell of a lot more fun than spending three hours a day at the gym, like Mr. Universe here.\u201d</p><p>We all laughed.</p><p>Murphy saw that he was outvoted, so we walked.</p><p>The walk was pleasant, but once there, we had a hard time deciding on what to see. For some odd reason, the pilots were insisting on a romantic comedy. Stephan and I wanted to see a newly released Sci-Fi horror flick. I didn\u2019t like romantic comedies as a rule, but I particularly refused to see the one they were pointing out. It was starring a young red-headed actress whom I\u2019d seen photographed with James.</p><p>If I watched the movie, I knew I\u2019d just obsess about him and get depressed all over again. When I suggested that we just watch two different movies, the pilots finally caved.</p><p>\u201cBut if I get nightmares after this, Damien is getting a roommate tonight. I am always the big spoon. No exceptions,\u201d Murphy warned.</p><p>Stephan and I laughed, but Damien just gave him a disgruntled look, as though he was genuinely worried Murphy would try it. That look just made me laugh harder.</p><p>I thought the movie was great, but Murphy didn\u2019t agree. \u201cThat scene where that chick cut the alien out of her...I can\u2019t stop seeing that in my head. I\u2019m going to be scarred for life now. You guys owe me for that.</p><p>I\u2019m making you all watch a lighthearted comedy next time,\u201d Murphy threatened as we walked back to the hotel.</p><p>Dark had fallen while we watched the movie, but the streets were well-lit and many people still walked along the popular street.</p><p>I noticed that Stephan had tensed up, and I followed his stare to a man taking pictures of us. I held his arm firmly, continuing to walk. Stephan looked about ready to punch the guy.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to just learn to ignore that sort of thing,\u201d I told him quietly. \u201cWe can\u2019t stop them from taking pictures, and we can\u2019t control what they say, so ignoring them is our only recourse.\u201d</p><p>He gave me an assessing glance. \u201cMaybe you are suited to James\u2019s lifestyle. It\u2019s pretty impressive that you\u2019re already accustomed to the paparazzi, considering that you\u2019ve only been dealing with them for a few weeks.\u201d</p><p>I gave my little shrug. \u201cIt\u2019s not the end of the world. I could do without all of the horrible things they\u2019ll print along with the pictures, but I really just need to learn to stop reading it. It\u2019s all garbage. Before I dated James, I never would have even glanced at any of it. I need to get back to that mindset.\u201d</p><p>Stephan nodded firmly. \u201cMe, too. I have Google alerts on you and James now. I need to quit torturing myself. It\u2019s not like we can stop any of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you see me looking up garbage gossip sites online, you need to stop me. This has gotten out of hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDitto, Buttercup.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER THREE</p><p>The days passed slowly, as I looked forward to seeing James. Despite my reservations, I almost called him to arrange a meeting sooner several times.</p><p>In the end, I had hardly any contact with James, only texting him briefly the Sunday before I was due to see him. I just told him where everyone had decided to meet. It was a work affair that I wasn\u2019t particularly enthused about attending. But Stephan wouldn\u2019t go anywhere without me lately, and I was tired of keeping him home. I knew he loved to go out, so I had agreed to attend the work party almost two weeks before.</p><p>Bianca: We\u2019re meeting at 6pm at The Dime Lounge. It\u2019s just off of the strip, on the east side of Tropicana. It\u2019s going to be a lot of flight attendants and pilots.</p><p>James: I\u2019ll be there.</p><p>I started getting ready at 3:30, which was early for me. Giving myself more than an hour to get ready was unusual, so taking over two hours meant that I was nervous. Nervous and excited.</p><p>It took me an uncharacteristically long time to choose an outfit. I finally settled on a black mini-skirt that showed a lot of leg. I paired it with a sleeveless black button-up silk top that showed a tasteful but generous hint of cleavage. The all-black outfit put me in the mood for some loud shoes, so I dug out a pair of wedge sandals that were a bright mix of colors that didn\u2019t go with anything but black. They were a mix of orange, yellow, pink and blue that made me smile. They laced up my ankles in wide satin ribbons, and I tied them in neat little bows there. I never got a chance to wear the impulsive purchase, and I was pleased with the overall look of the outfit. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I found some big silver hoops for my ears. I eyed a silver box that had arrived in my mail the day I\u2019d gotten home from the hospital. I\u2019d glanced inside of it, seen the contents, and shut it without another glance. It contained the collar and watch that James had given me, before all hell had broken loose. I didn\u2019t know what to do with the jewelry. I didn\u2019t feel like I could keep it, since we weren\u2019t together. But I was also sure that James wouldn\u2019t accept it back. He obviously wouldn\u2019t, since the last time I\u2019d returned it it had just ended up in my mailbox.</p><p>I did my hair and makeup, stewing about the jewelry.</p><p>Part of me wanted to just wear it. The collar would go well with my neckline, setting off my cleavage nicely. James would be happy to see me wear it, I knew. But it might also give him the wrong idea. He might take it to mean that I was willing to pick up again where we\u2019d last left off. I wasn\u2019t sure I was willing to do that.</p><p>A change came over me when I was near James. A change that I wasn\u2019t sure I liked. He\u2019d gotten me to fall in love with him after just over a week of knowing him. And if that wasn\u2019t bat-shit crazy, I didn\u2019t know what was.</p> <p>I left my hair pin straight and hanging down my back in a pale, beige-blond line. I lined my eyes in a soft brown. I had a heavy hand with the black mascara and used a generous amount of gold eyeshadow. I went with a soft pink lip, liberally applying gloss. It was more makeup than I usually went with, but I thought it would suit a place like The Dime just fine.</p><p>The overall effect made me feel sexy and sophisticated, and that was exactly what I wanted. I needed to feel confident when I saw James again.</p><p>I heard my phone chime, and knew it would be Stephan, saying it was time to go. A look at the clock told me that.</p><p>Impulsively, I opened the silver box. I weighed the lovely choker in my hands. It was a silver color, though I had no idea what metal it was. I could never tell the difference. But it looked expensive, with diamonds peppering the whole necklace, and a loop on the front made entirely of alarmingly large ones. I hadn\u2019t realized how large they were before.</p><p>I took a deep breath, and reached back to put it on. The weight of it felt nice against the base of my neck, and I studied it, running my finger along it. I needed to go, but I couldn\u2019t seem to look away from the collar around my neck.</p> <p>I glanced back at the box, and noticed for the first time that the box held more than just the necklace and watch. I opened another small box that I had overlooked with my previous cursory inspection. It contained exquisite, large hooped earrings made up of large diamonds that matched the details on my collar to the T.</p><p>I bit my lip, and put them on. In for a penny, in for a pound, I thought recklessly.</p><p>I hurried out the door, and, sure enough, Stephan\u2019s car was waiting in my driveway. I got into his car, digging into my small clutch-purse as I did so. I checked to make sure I had all the essentials.</p><p>Stephan let out a low whistle at the sight of me. \u201cYou look hot, Buttercup. If you hadn\u2019t told me James was stopping by to see you, I could have guessed by that mini skirt.\u201d</p><p>I gave him a sharp look, but couldn\u2019t maintain it for long. He had a point. I hardly ever tried to dress sexy.</p><p>\u201cEveryone is going to be there,\u201d Stephan told me happily as we drove the twenty minutes to the club. He started naming off the attendees. Some I would normally have been happy to see, but at the moment, not so much.</p> <p>Everyone knew I had been attacked in my home. And that I had been hospitalized for over a week. The rumor was that I\u2019d had a home invader attack me, but people would be asking me well-meaning questions about it nonetheless. I hated the kinds of questions that I knew would be asked. I hated that people had even a vague idea of what had happened to me.</p><p>I\u2019d survived, and the rest were just details , I told myself firmly. It was a mantra that always snapped me out of self-pity mode. As usual, it worked. I was alive, and it was enough.</p><p>We had a good-natured argument as we drove about whether Stephan should pop the collar of his polo.</p><p>He\u2019d worn the collar up, and I\u2019d noticed almost immediately. I just couldn\u2019t seem to get onboard with the style. There was just something inherently douche-baggy about the look. I told him so.</p><p>He eventually caved, straightening his collar with a rueful smile.</p><p>\u201cJust because you like a look, that doesn\u2019t make it right,\u201d I teased him.</p><p>We got to the lounge a solid ten minutes before six. The doorman was checking our I.D\u2019s and even our airline badges. We both had them on us, since we had been told we\u2019d need them to get an employee discount, but it was unusual to have to show them at the door.</p><p>I heard a familiar voice behind me. \u201cThese are Mr. Cavendish\u2019s guests. I\u2019ll walk them in.\u201d</p> <p>I turned, giving a surprised smile to Clark. I inwardly cringed, thinking of the last time he\u2019d seen me.</p><p>I\u2019d been a complete mess, running into traffic like a maniac. But it wasn\u2019t his fault he\u2019d seen me in that state, so I tried to greet him as though it hadn\u2019t happened. \u201cHow are you, Clark?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He smiled at me warmly. He seemed genuinely pleased to see me. \u201cJust great, Ms. Karlsson. I\u2019m very happy to see you looking so well.\u201d</p><p>I just nodded, automatically shying away from the subject of what had made me so un well recently.</p><p>Clark led us through the dimly lit lounge, heading straight to the small VIP section.</p><p>I sighed.</p><p>Of course James would be in VIP, but it kind of defeated the whole purpose of us being here, socializing with co-workers.</p><p>Sure enough, we were no sooner seated than Stephan was bouncing back up, spotting a friend of ours across the room. It was our friend, Jessa. I hadn\u2019t seen her in over a month, and I really did want to say hi.</p><p>I saw quickly that James was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>I sent Clark an apologetic glance. \u201cThanks for showing us to the table, Clark, but I see someone I want to chat with. Where is James?\u201d</p><p>Clark looked uncomfortable. He was even fidgeting with his tie. The nervous gesture seemed very uncharacteristic for him. \u201cIn the car, finishing up some phone calls. I\u2019m pretty sure he didn\u2019t think you\u2019d be so prompt, or I know he would have wrapped his business up by now.\u201d</p><p>I just nodded and headed over to where Stephan and Jessa were hugging in greeting. She saw me and gasped. She gave me a hug that was hard enough that I had to hide a little gasp. My ribs were still a little tender, if they were pressed just wrong. She\u2019d hit just the wrong spot with her exuberant squeeze. I hid my reaction and returned her hug.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so good to see you looking better,\u201d Jessa gushed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I couldn\u2019t come by the hospital or visit you before. Thing\u2019s have been crazy lately, and I didn\u2019t hear about anything until you were leaving the hospital. And I was out of town at the time.\u201d She glared at Stephan. \u201cStephan here kept it under wraps. Even from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, don\u2019t give it a thought. In fact, let\u2019s never talk about it again. How\u2019ve you been? Where have you been flying this month?\u201d I asked her.</p><p>Jessa was from our flight attendant class. She was a tall brunette, nearly my height, with lovely brown eyes and the warmest smile. She was one of my favorite people. When possible, we tried to meet up with her at least twice a month to catch up. She had a great sense of humor, and loved to go out. Even Stephan was a homebody compared to her.</p><p>She was flipping her thick, curly hair behind her shoulders as she told us a story about some passenger on her last flight who\u2019d tried to smoke in the bathroom and then lie about it. She was getting agitated just relating the story about the shameless lies the old man had tried to get away with.</p><p>I had to hide a smile. She was always getting agitated with the crazies. And her sassy way of dealing with them was just good comedy.</p><p>A cocktail waitress in a mini skirt and corset promptly approached us and got our drink orders. Stephan was drinking house cabernet. I stuck with water. I was off of alcohol, especially if James was attending.</p><p>He abhorred the stuff.</p><p>I spotted Brenda by the bar, and waved. She joined us, smiling.</p><p>\u201cWe missed you guys this week,\u201d she said in greeting.</p><p>\u201cCindy and Lars are great, though, right?\u201d I asked, smiling. The couple we had traded with were notoriously fun to work with.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah, those two are a blast. We still missed you, though.\u201d She pursed her lips. \u201cJake and I, I mean.\u201d</p><p>We shared a wry smile. I didn\u2019t have to ask why she had left out Melissa\u2019s name. The other girl was acting more and more unhinged every time I dealt with her. I had known she wouldn\u2019t miss us.</p><p>She noticed my jewelry. \u201cThat is the loveliest necklace and earrings. So unique.\u201d</p><p>I fingered my choker, thanking her.</p><p>\u201cDid your husband come?\u201d I asked, glancing around. He often came with her to work functions, and sometimes even joined her on layovers.</p><p>\u201cNo, he didn\u2019t get off of work until six, and he says he\u2019s beat. I probably won\u2019t stay long. It\u2019s just so hard to miss out on an opportunity to see so many of the flight attendants that I rarely get to see. We should organize these parties more often.\u201d</p><p>Jessa agreed with her heartily, and they chatted about trying to do just that for a solid ten minutes.</p><p>Jake joined us amidst their plans, hugging everyone while managing to seem interested in the current conversation. I hugged him back lightly. I had had a hard time with the flight attendant hugging situation right at first, but the custom had grown on me. When you had close friends that you only got to see once a month in passing, a hug seemed appropriate. Though everyone, even not so close friends, seemed to insist on the habit. I just went with it now. No one else understood my hangup, I knew. So I had just learned to keep it to myself.</p><p>A tall, slender, dark-haired man approached Stephan from behind, clapping him on the shoulder in greeting. The man leaned in close to Stephan\u2019s ear, whispering something. Stephan seemed to blush down to his toes.</p><p>I watched the whole thing as if in slow-motion, my jaw dropping in shock.</p><p>CHAPTER FOUR</p><p>It took me a long moment to recognize the man, since what I was seeing made no sense to me.</p><p>Javier Flores and Stephan were not exactly on friendly terms. Last I had checked, they were closer to bitter exes. The two men hadn\u2019t spoken for over a year. Or so I had thought.</p><p>Javier was Stephan\u2019s version of the one that got away.</p><p>The two men were as dissimilar physically as they were personality-wise. Though both men were tall and handsome, Stephan was much taller. Javier was maybe an inch shy of six feet. And where Stephan resembled a strapping Abercrombie and Fitch model with his blond good looks, Javier was almost delicate looking. His face was just plain pretty, with perfect, even features, and the thickest eyelashes I\u2019d ever seen. He had jet black hair that hung to his shoulders, falling into his eyes artfully as he tilted his head forward, giving Stephan a wicked sideways smile. He was tall and slender, almost thin. His dark brown eyes were mysterious and lovely, but I had always found them a little cold and distant.</p><p>The two men had dated for just a month, over a year ago. It had been an intense month, but it had ended quickly, and badly. Javier had a real problem being Stephan\u2019s secret lover, and he hadn\u2019t tolerated the situation for long. He\u2019d given Stephan an ultimatum; Stop hiding their relationship, or he was out. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Javier had been shocked and hurt when Stephan had chosen the latter. He\u2019d been giving Stephan the silent treatment ever since, avoiding him at parties like this. He\u2019d even left the room at the sight of Stephan for several months after the breakup. Stephan had been crushed by the whole thing.</p><p>I had understood that Javier was hurt badly, but I still thought he\u2019d been an asshole about the breakup.</p><p>Still, I\u2019d been upset about the breakup as well. Stephan had never looked at any guy the way he looked at Javier, and I\u2019d really hoped, at the beginning, that the relationship would work out for them.</p><p>Javier saw me staring at him, and his smiled died a quick death. He\u2019d always been polite and courteous with me, but I\u2019d sensed that I made him wary. Not a lot of people understood the relationship between Stephan and I.</p> <p>Javier surprised me by striding to me and enveloping me in a soft hug. \u201cI\u2019m so happy to see you well, Bianca.\u201d</p><p>I hugged him back automatically. He didn\u2019t let go for some strange reason.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t hate me, do you?\u201d he whispered in my ear.</p><p>I blinked, meeting Stephan\u2019s sheepish eyes over Javier\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWhy would I hate you?\u201d I asked him quietly. He\u2019d thrown me for a loop.</p> <p>\u201cFor being such a bastard to Stephan for so long. My heart was totally broken, but that\u2019s no excuse for the way I treated him. And I wasn\u2019t exactly nice to you. I stopped speaking to you as well, even though none of it was your fault. Stephan even tells me that you defended me, up until I threw a fit at that Valentine\u2019s party and embarrassed myself.\u201d</p><p>Javier had been on our crew for the month when he and Stephan had started seeing each other. I had never even given a thought to the fact that Javier hadn\u2019t spoken to me either, since the breakup. All things considered, I had just expected it.</p><p>\u201cI know it sounds crazy, but I was jealous of you. I had myself half-convinced that something was going on between the two of you, and that was why Stephan couldn\u2019t seem to commit to being gay.\u201d</p><p>I stiffened. He hugged me tighter, though his hold was still soft. I doubted that the slender man had it in him to be rough.</p><p>\u201cI know. Crazy, right?\u201d Javier continued. \u201cBut me and Stephan have been talking again. Please, tell me you\u2019re okay with it.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, though I wasn\u2019t really sure what to think. Javier\u2019s about-face was just so sudden and unexpected, and Stephan hadn\u2019t said a word. I had just barely caught up with the fact that he wasn\u2019t seeing Melvin anymore.</p> <p>\u201cYes, of course. I\u2019m not Stephan\u2019s keeper, contrary to popular belief.\u201d</p><p>He kissed my forehead, pulling back to look at me. \u201cI know, but you\u2019re his family. I just want us to be cool.\u201d</p><p>His eyes were earnest and pleading now, far from the cool way they usually looked. It gave me hope.</p><p>Perhaps he just acted cool, to hide his feelings. I could well understand that.</p><p>I smiled at him. It was stiff, but not for lack of effort. \u201cYes. Okay. I want whatever makes Stephan happy. Always.\u201d</p><p>Javier nodded emphatically, finally stepping away from me. \u201cGood. Great. Stephan was worried you wouldn\u2019t like us seeing each other again.\u201d</p><p>I sent Stephan a baffled look. He was still watching us, looking distressed.</p><p>\u201cHe should know better,\u201d I said.</p> <p>Javier moved back to Stephan. I was floored by what happened next. Stephan threw an arm over Javier\u2019s shoulders, messing up his hair playfully. He released the smaller man almost instantly, but it was still the most affectionate thing I\u2019d ever seen him do in public with another man.</p><p>For some reason, I felt my eyes getting moist.</p><p>Stephan caught my eye, walking over to me. He pushed me into his chest, leaning down to speak into my ear. \u201cAre you really okay with this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of a question is that?\u201d I asked, my voice muffled against his pale orange polo. \u201cAnd why is this the first I\u2019m hearing about it?\u201d</p><p>He was running a hand up and down my back soothingly. \u201cIt was just weird timing. I kept meaning to, but things have been so crazy. I could never find the right time. He actually called me because he heard you\u2019d been hurt, and he wanted to make sure we were both okay. That\u2019s sweet, right?\u201d</p><p>I pushed back, nodding at him. \u201cWhat about your...issues?\u201d</p><p>He swallowed, hard. \u201cJavier and I talked about it. And I realized he has a very good point. I don\u2019t have to make an announcement to the world. I don\u2019t need a coming-out ball, yanno? But I don\u2019t need to lie about it anymore, either. I can just live my life. I don\u2019t owe any explanations to anybody. I always said I just wanted my private life private, but I\u2019m beginning to see that there was more to it. And I have nothing to be ashamed of, right?\u201d</p><p>He had tried to make it a statement, but I still heard the question in there. I gripped his arms, hard. \u201cNot a thing. I\u2019m so proud of you, Stephan.\u201d</p><p>He squeezed my arm. We avoided eye contact for a long minute, both blinking back embarrassing tears.</p><p>Finally, composed, he just nodded, heading back to stand near Javier. He gripped the other man\u2019s shoulder briefly before folding his arms across his chest, listening to whatever Jessa was ranting about.</p><p>I felt a little in shock about Stephan\u2019s sudden, drastic change of heart. But it was a good shock.</p><p>I watched the two men for several minutes, dazed by the change in Stephan. It wasn\u2019t full on PDA, but he kept playfully poking Javier in the chest, or tugging on a lock of his hair. Javier kept his hands carefully to himself, but he was giving Stephan the warmest, sweetest looks. I thought it was beautiful.</p><p>Murphy and Damien were the next to join our group, and made the rounds, hugging everyone. I realized that our little group had grown rather large and loud.</p><p>I searched the spacious lounge, thinking that James might have a hard time spotting me in such a large group, but I saw no sign of him.</p><p>I did spot Melissa across the room. She was sitting by the bar with Captain Peter. She was wearing a skin-tight red dress, staring at our group sullenly. I wondered, a little cattily, why she insisted on wearing colors that clashed with her hair. I mentally chastised myself. She was an unpleasant person, but that was no excuse for sinking to her level.</p><p>I gave her a little wave when our eyes met, resolving to at least be polite since she was a member of our crew for at least another month. She just nodded back, then looked away. At least she hadn\u2019t flipped me off.</p><p>I focused back on our growing group as we were joined by two more.</p><p>It was Judith and Marnie. They\u2019d been on our crew a few months back. They were inseparable party girls. Judith had long black hair, and Marnie was a platinum blond. They were both very short with great figures and cute faces. They sort of reminded me of naughty pixies. Half-drunk naughty pixies at the moment.</p><p>I remembered that they often introduced themselves to men at bars as Ivanna Humpalot and Alotta Vagina. They rarely went back to their rooms alone, sometimes even sharing men with each other. They were a funny pair, but not for the faint of heart. Stephan and I had been at Judith\u2019s twenty-first birthday party about two months ago. It had been crazy. She\u2019d made out with at least three men that I\u2019d seen, and dragged two of them to her hotel room.</p><p>Marnie was a year older than Judith, just twenty-two. I was older than both girls, but the two of them had me beat by a lot of years in experience. They both thought any woman who had lasted to fifteen with their virginity intact was a prude. I didn\u2019t imagine they even had a word for someone who had lasted until age twenty-three, like I had.</p><p>Judith squealed in delight when she saw me. She rushed over and hugged me.</p><p>\u201cI heard about the attack. How are you doing?\u201d she nearly shouted.</p><p>I hugged her back stiffly, wishing she hadn\u2019t spoken so loudly. \u201cGood. How are you?\u201d</p><p>She cast a sidelong glance in Damien\u2019s direction.</p><p>\u201cHow much you wanna bet I\u2019ll wake up in Damien\u2019s bed tomorrow?\u201d she whispered. \u201cThen I\u2019ll be good. Marnie hooked up with him a few months ago. She says he\u2019s hung. The last guy I hooked up with was a real disappointment. It had to have given me some like good cock charma, right?\u201d</p><p>Her words surprised a laugh out of me. I hadn\u2019t known about the hook-up between Marnie and Damien, but I wasn\u2019t surprised.</p><p>\u201cTMI, Judith,\u201d I told her with a smile. \u201cI have to work with him every week.\u201d</p><p>Marnie had sidled up next to us, squeezing between us to hug me softly. \u201cIf Judith goes after him tonight, I\u2019m joining them,\u201d she said with a wink. \u201cI swear to god, if any man can handle two women at once, it\u2019s him. He\u2019s a marathon man.\u201d</p><p>Judith wrinkled her nose at Marnie. \u201cI never get the really good ones to myself. She always wants a piece.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t even try to hide my laugh. She was complaining, but her tone was more amused than upset.</p><p>Damien caught my eye from a few feet away. He didn\u2019t walk over, just gave me wide, questioning eyes. I was sure he was worried what they were telling me about him. I just smirked at him. He covered his face with his hands, and I swore I could hear his pained groan. I didn\u2019t feel real bad for him, since I was willing to bet he\u2019d end up with the feisty girls by the end of the night.</p><p>\u201cI heard a rumor that you lost your V-card. Finally. And to some super hot rich guy. Is it true?\u201d</p><p>I grimaced. The rumor mill was alive and well, and apparently held some truth. \u201cYes. Please don\u2019t say it so loud.\u201d</p><p>I was still mortified that the two girls even knew I\u2019d been a virgin. They had guessed it, strangely enough, considering I knew few people who knew less about being virgins themselves. We\u2019d been in Judith\u2019s hotel room, watching some romantic comedy on a layover, when the two girls had started in on their favorite sex stories. They\u2019d asked me to share, and I\u2019d just blushed. They had guessed, with no little disgust, that I was a virgin. I had to give them a firm talking to when they wouldn\u2019t stop trying to find men to relieve me of the \u2018problem\u2019. Marnie had even volunteered to lend me her on-again off-again boyfriend at the time. I had not taken the offer well. I\u2019d gotten over it, though, knowing she was a little oblivious to other people\u2019s feelings when it came to things like that.</p><p>\u201cWell, congratulations. Was he any good? Sometimes the really good-looking ones are horrible in bed.</p><p>It\u2019s that whole, I\u2019m so hot I don\u2019t even have to try, mentality. Yanno?\u201d Judith elbowed Marnie playfully in the ribs while she spoke.</p><p>I just shook my head, wide-eyed. I most certainly didn\u2019t know anything about that. I couldn\u2019t imagine there was a man on the planet who was better in bed. I didn\u2019t particularly want to share that information, though.</p><p>\u201cSo he was good? Your first time was good?\u201d Marnie pried.</p><p>I nodded, very uncomfortable. The sharing personal information thing was so not for me.</p><p>\u201cOn a scale of one to ten, what was he?\u201d</p><p>I sighed. They were not gonna let up. \u201cHow would, \u2018I want him to fuck me to death, and he just might\u2019, rate on that scale?\u201d</p><p>The women hooted with laughter, but their laughter died as they looked up and to my left. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I felt a familiar firm hand grip my nape. Soft lips that I was well acquainted with kissed my cheek.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a heartwarming assessment, Love,\u201d James murmured against my skin.</p><p>CHAPTER FIVE</p><p>I felt heat suffuse my cheeks in a rush, and a perverse shiver of pure pleasure rock my body.</p> <p>Typical James timing. Showing up at the most disarming moment possible.</p><p>Judith and Marnie were just staring at him, stunned speechless for a long moment.</p><p>I turned to look up at him. His hand fell from my nape and we just stared at each other. I drank in the sight of him.</p><p>He looked... wonderful. He was dressed in a bright blue polo with dark washed, fitted jeans, and navy running shoes. It was the \u2018James\u2019s supermodel take on casual\u2019, I thought. Even his casual looked too sexy for public. I\u2019d never seen him in jeans before. He made them look sinful. I saw just the hint of the top of his tan chest at his collar, and had to stifle my urge to check my mouth for drool. His caramel- colored hair just brushed that collar, and I clenched my hands to keep them at my sides. I wanted to touch him. But touching always led to too much, too fast, with us.</p><p>I met his vivid blue eyes. They were intense and unsmiling. His eyes dropped down to my earrings and then to the collar at my throat. His jaw clenched, then unclenched. He ran his tongue over his teeth. My whole body seemed to clench.</p> <p>\u201cThank you for wearing those. It was...considerate of you,\u201d he said in his most polite, if hoarse, voice.</p><p>He swallowed, shoving his hands into his pockets, then folding them across his chest. It made his upper arms bulge through his fitted shirt distractingly. His chest and arms looked bigger than I remembered, the muscles bulging as though he\u2019d been lifting weights excessively. The material of his shirt looked so soft it made me itch to run my fingers over it. But that light touch would turn to a stroke. And then I would stroke harder to feel the resilient flesh beneath... James\u2019s eyes were running down my body now, not for the first time. His eyes were on my very bare legs, then my cleavage.</p><p>\u201cYour legs are outrageous. You make that mini skirt look illegal.\u201d He looked back at my face, finally.</p><p>\u201cYou look beautiful.\u201d He took a deep, harsh breath, staring at me. It was gratifying. \u201cBut isn\u2019t that outfit a bit sexy for a work function?\u201d</p><p>I wrinkled my nose at him, then pointedly looked around the room. This was Vegas, and we were in a bar full of flight attendants. My attire was downright modest compared to some of the outfits I saw.</p><p>\u201cDid you want me to fuck you in front of all of your co-workers? Because that\u2019s all I can think about, when I see you in that outfit.\u201d His voice was pitched low, but I gasped at his words.</p> <p>\u201cThis was supposed to be a short, casual meeting,\u201d I told him, a hint of accusation in my voice.</p><p>He took another deep breath, looking around the room, and away from me. I watched as he counted to ten silently.</p><p>\u201cI missed you,\u201d he said finally.</p><p>I had missed him too, but I couldn\u2019t make myself tell him that. He still unsettled me too much for that kind of honesty. Instead, I said the first thing that popped into my head. \u201cYou were late.\u201d</p><p>His jaw clenched again. \u201cYes. I was in my car, in the middle of the most annoying business call of my life. I think I may need to fire my manager in New York. I didn\u2019t see you arrive, and lost track of time. I apologize. I didn\u2019t want to miss a second of our time together, which made the phone call particularly annoying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. We got here early, for once, so I was just surprised to see that you weren\u2019t early, for once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIntroduce us,\u201d Judith said loudly.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t surprised. The two party girls had shown a surprising amount of self-control in letting us talk quietly for as long as we had.</p> <p>I turned, giving the women a rueful smile. Jessa moved closer, and we suddenly had the attention of the entire group.</p><p>I went around the group, naming all of the people that James hadn\u2019t yet met. I touched James\u2019s arm lightly as I finished. \u201cEveryone, this is my friend, James,\u201d I said, feeling awkward. I had no idea what to call him.</p><p>\u201cBoyfriend,\u201d James corrected, and I raised a brow at him. I didn\u2019t know what he was, but it didn\u2019t seem like he could call himself that. \u201cVery serious boyfriend,\u201d he elaborated with a smirk.</p><p>I thought I knew what he was doing. He wanted to talk to me in private, and he knew that giving himself that title would antagonize me enough to draw me into an argument. I wasn\u2019t going to bite, though, I told myself resolutely. And he was overly possessive. He would say anything to warn other men off.</p><p>I sent Damien a glance. He was watching us, his mouth tight. I glanced away quickly, wanting to avoid drawing attention to the fact that he was staring at us rather intently.</p><p>Judith and Marnie began chatting James up mercilessly. I was more than a little surprised that they weren\u2019t hitting on him. Not even a little bit. It seemed more like they were interviewing him. I thought it was kind of sweet. They were the most flirtatious women I knew, but they were going out of their way to be completely platonic with someone whom they thought was my boyfriend. Someone who happened to be the most beautiful man on the planet. It made me see that they were good friends to me. Maybe better than I\u2019d given them credit for.</p><p>I had a sad habit of being more cynical than was warranted. Kindness or consideration almost always caught me by surprise if it came from anyone but Stephan. I supposed he was the only person I\u2019d ever allowed myself to have expectations of. I had plenty of friends. Mostly casual friends. But friendship and trust just hadn\u2019t been a connection I\u2019d made. I listened to the girls asking James question after question, even their language cleaned up.</p><p>I suddenly felt old beyond my twenty-three years. I\u2019d always thought they were the mature, experienced ones, but I certainly had them beat in the cynicism department.</p><p>I touched James\u2019s arm with just the tips of my fingers. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back. I need to use the restroom.\u201d</p><p>James tried to walk me to the bathroom, but I waved him off.</p><p>\u201cGo say hi to Stephan,\u201d I told him.</p><p>He gave me a stern look, but headed in that direction.</p><p>Judith and Marnie joined me. The top of their heads were right at a level with my chest. I always felt like a giant when I was hanging out with them.</p><p>\u201cO M G, Bianca, that is the most beautiful man I\u2019ve ever seen in my life,\u201d Judith gushed as we made our way across the bar. I flushed, but I certainly couldn\u2019t dispute the comment.</p><p>\u201cThat man is downright pretty,\u201d Marnie said.</p><p>I wrinkled my nose. The word pretty just sounded so feminine to me. And that was so not James.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s good in bed, too?\u201d Marnie asked, clearly skeptical. \u201cThat just isn\u2019t fair. If I looked like him, I\u2019d never leave my house. I\u2019d just stay home and fuck myself. If you tell me he has a big dick, I might become either a cutter or a lesbian.\u201d</p><p>We got to the line for the restroom, filing into the outrageous crowd that had already formed a good twenty feet away from the actual bathroom.</p><p>I smiled ruefully. \u201cThen I won\u2019t tell you,\u201d I said.</p><p>Both women started making loud sounds of despair. I laughed at their theatrics.</p><p>\u201cI guess good things really do come to those who wait.\u201d Judith said, sounding sad. \u201cI can\u2019t go on one date without sleeping with a guy. And I can\u2019t go two days without finding a date, so I guess I\u2019ll never be getting anyone good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait to come either, so I guess I won\u2019t be getting anything that good. That kind of good only comes to those who wait twenty-three years, apparently,\u201d Marnie said forlornly. She brightened, snapping out of it almost immediately. \u201cBut we are gonna get a piece of Captain Damien tonight. He\u2019s a nice slice of something good.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t point out that he hadn\u2019t even looked happy to see them. I doubted it would even slow them down. They were a persuasive pair.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s with all this tabloid garbage I keep seeing?\u201d Marnie asked, leveling a rather serious stare at me.</p><p>I grimaced. \u201cMostly lies and just horrible people saying horrible things because it gets attention. I\u2019m trying to ignore it.\u201d</p><p>Judith gave me a baffled look. \u201cI think it\u2019s awesome. It feels like we know a celebrity now. I think it\u2019s all so fun and exciting. And he\u2019s so beautiful. There could be worse things.\u201d</p><p>She had a good point about the worse things, I thought.</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cI can\u2019t change it, so I\u2019m adjusting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo he doesn\u2019t have a longtime girlfriend?\u201d Marnie asked. \u201cI read somewhere that he was dating some gorgeous heiress, for like, the last eight years.\u201d</p><p>Talk about a mood killing change of topic.</p><p>I sighed. \u201cHe tells me she\u2019s just a friend. I guess the question is, do I believe him? I\u2019m working it out.</p><p>Trusting him is not my first instinct, but that doesn\u2019t really have anything to do with him.\u201d</p><p>Judith gestured at my jewelry. \u201cAnd all this gorgeous bling. I vote trust him.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. They were starting to remind me of a half-drunk version of good cop, bad cop.</p><p>Marnie patted my shoulder. \u201cBe careful, Bianca. That man looks like he could break hearts for fun, yanno?\u201d</p><p>Judith pretended to fan herself. \u201cBut what fun, right?\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t argue with any of it. It was nothing that I hadn\u2019t thought myself.</p><p>There was a group of women huddled close, a few people ahead of us. They were whispering and rudely pointing me out. I didn\u2019t know any of them, but they were most likely other flight attendants that I\u2019d never worked with. I guessed that they\u2019d read something dreadful about me. I ignored them. It was something I was going to have to get used to.</p><p>It was all part of the media circus that surrounded James\u2019s life. And I had apparently decided not to give up on the man, despite my better judgement. He still wanted me, and he was a hard man to ignore when he was in hot pursuit.</p><p>The group burst into laughter. Even their laughter sounded catty, so I knew they were saying something awful. I forced my mind to focus on something else, a longtime habit I\u2019d used for avoiding unpleasant things that couldn\u2019t be changed.</p><p>We eventually made it through the line and got in and out of the bathroom without incident. The group of mean girls had had Judith and Marnie about ready to brawl. They\u2019d gotten progressively louder, emphasizing words like \u2018whore\u2019 and \u2018gold-digger\u2019, as they shot me strangely malevolent glances.</p><p>Whatever they\u2019d read about me, I couldn\u2019t understand how it would affect them, or why they would care enough to be openly hostile to a stranger. It was beyond me, so I didn\u2019t linger on the musings long.</p><p>CHAPTER SIX</p><p>My back stiffened as we approached our group again. James was standing near Stephan and Javier, and they were laughing at something. But he wasn\u2019t alone. Melissa was practically plastered to his side, laughing along with them.</p><p>\u201cYou notice that bitch didn\u2019t say boo until we left. Then she swooped in like a vulture,\u201d Marnie was saying under her breath. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t like her. She talks a lot of shit about people for doing less messed-up shit than she does on a regular basis,\u201d Judith added.</p><p>I tried to follow all of the shits in that sentence. I gave up as we got close enough for me to see the way Melissa\u2019s hands were sneaking in little touches all over James.</p><p>She touched his arm, patted his back, reached way way up and squeezed his shoulder. And then ran her hand along his chest and stomach on it\u2019s way back down. James took a little step back, avoiding her touch, but I still saw red. Red as in crimson. Crimson as in blood. Blood as in I was going to make the bitch bleed.</p><p>I moved between the two of them in an odd haze of temper, plastering myself to his side and pushing her roughly out of the way with my body. I ran my hand along the line of his chest and abdomen that she\u2019d touched, as though my touch could erase hers.</p> <p>I heard the ice cubes in her drink clink against her glass as she was jostled by my sudden movement.</p><p>She gasped in outrage.</p><p>I ignored her, looking up at James. \u201cWhy were you letting her touch you?\u201d I asked him quietly.</p><p>He looked surprised, and half-amused. \u201cI thought she was a friend of yours. I was trying not to be openly rude, but she was making it difficult. You have a drink while you were gone? You were gone for thirty minutes. Now you\u2019re acting a little...differently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou fucking bitch. You made me spill my drink on my dress,\u201d Melissa was yelling behind me. It was easy to ignore her, for some reason.</p> <p>I ran my hands up and down James\u2019s torso again, using my fingertips to trace each muscle. He was unbelievably hard.</p><p>\u201cNot one part of my body is this hard,\u201d I mused aloud.</p><p>\u201cCareful, Love. You can\u2019t offer a starving man a feast and expect him not to take you up on it.\u201d</p><p>I stroked his chest again, pausing at one of his nipples. \u201cI want to see your skin,\u201d I told him.</p><p>Now I\u2019d done it. I\u2019d gone and touched him, and it was worse than being drunk. I couldn\u2019t seem to focus on anything but touching more of him.</p><p>\u201cFucking Bitch!\u201d Melissa said louder. \u201cDo you have any idea how much this dress is worth? It\u2019s BCBG. Do you even know what that is, you skank?\u201d</p> <p>I saw James\u2019s eyes widen just a second before he spun me around, putting his back to the crazy redhead.</p><p>I heard the sound of a drink being thrown, glass and all, against his rock-hard back.</p><p>It had been aimed at the back of my head, I realized, stunned. She was such a crazy bitch... \u201cFuck,\u201d James said, glaring over his shoulder at a still fuming Melissa. \u201cYou need to get the fuck out of here, or security will be escorting you out. I think you\u2019ve embarrassed yourself enough tonight, don\u2019t you?\u201d His tone was positively scathing.</p><p>Melissa cursed fluently as she stormed away.</p><p>Our group erupted into chatter as she walked away. The general consensus was, \u2018Bitch is crazy\u2019.</p><p>\u201cBitch be cray cray,\u201d Murphy summed it up, as only Murphy could. Everyone laughed, breaking the last bit of tension.</p><p>I looked up at James, pursing my lips. \u201cThat was gentlemanly of you, taking the shot for me,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p> <p>He shook out his shirt, ice cubes still flying off of his back. I checked his back. His shirt was soaked.</p><p>Even his jeans were soaked. I was relieved to find, though, that the glass had broken on the ground, leaving him unscathed.</p><p>A waitress showed up with a bucket and mop and began to clean up the liquid and broken glass. We moved out of her way.</p><p>\u201cIt looks like you\u2019re going to have to take off all of your clothes,\u201d I told him with a smile.</p><p>He smiled back, but his smile was all heat. \u201cI have a change of clothes in the car. Come with me?\u201d</p><p>I leaned in closer to him, inhaling deeply. He smelled so good that I felt my eyelids drift closed with the pleasure of his scent. It was so good that I wanted to put a name to it, and bottle it up.</p><p>\u201cConvince me,\u201d I told him softly, as I forced my eyes back open to look at him.</p><p>He glanced around, running his tongue over those sexy as hell teeth. \u201cOkay. Did you have something particular in mind, or do I get to pick how? I\u2019m trying to play nice here, since I don\u2019t want to scare you off again. You\u2019re not making it easy, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour shirt\u2019s all wet. I want you to take it off. I want to see your skin.\u201d</p><p>He gave me an appraising look. \u201cThat\u2019s it? All I have to do to get you to my car is to take my shirt off?\u201d He was whipping it off before he\u2019d even finished his question.</p><p>Hoots and whistles were starting up around the lounge as people took in the spectacular sight of his naked torso.</p><p>I gasped at the sight of all of his bare skin. He had definitely bulked up in the month we\u2019d been apart, his already impressive chest swollen attractively. It was distracting, to say the least.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been lifting more weights,\u201d I observed.</p><p>His smile was a little pained. \u201cI needed a little more physical activity to adjust to the whole celibacy thing. I usually work out for two hours in the morning. I added two more in the evening, as well, as a sort of...sleep aid.\u201d</p><p>I felt a strange stirring of guilt, and a not so strange thrill of joy at his mention of celibacy. I opened my mouth to say...something, but I couldn\u2019t seem to hold a thought, with all of his bare skin in front of me.</p><p>My captivated gaze moved lower.</p><p>His jeans dipped low. I traced the skin just above his jeans. It was dangerous territory, dipping into a sharply defined V. An impressive and growing arousal was making his jeans more obscene by the second.</p><p>He gripped my hand. \u201cUnless part of my convincing you was that you want to get fucked against the nearest wall, I\u2019d start walking, Buttercup.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed my hand and started walking.</p><p>\u201cI need a new shirt,\u201d James called in Stephan\u2019s direction as we passed. Stephan gave him a wide-eyed look, but just nodded. \u201cWe\u2019ll be back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to have his babies,\u201d someone muttered as we passed.</p><p>I sent a glare in their general direction. I couldn\u2019t get real mad about it, though. I had made him bare the finest chest in the world to a room full of hungry flight attendants... And if anyone got a glance at his jeans, it certainly wouldn\u2019t lessen their interest.</p><p>Clark met us at the entrance of the club, holding the door open, face impassive.</p><p>\u201cNice catch, Sir,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>I smiled at him, knowing he was referring to James moving to protect me from the thrown drink.</p><p>\u201cAny paparazzi in the parking lot?\u201d James asked brusquely.</p><p>\u201cMax just did a sweep. Looks clean so far, Mr. Cavendish.\u201d</p><p>James just nodded, almost dragging me through the small back parking lot.</p><p>Clark managed to get in front of us again to open the car door. \u201cYour suitcase is already in there, and open.\u201d</p><p>James nodded. \u201cVery good,\u201d he said, ushering me into the car first.</p><p>I sat down, then scooted across the seat to make room for James. He crowded in behind me without a pause, the door shutting behind him. I heard him take a few ragged breaths, and then he was on me.</p><p>He had me on my back between one breath and the next. He opened my legs wide, crawling between them. He unbuttoned his jeans, pulling his stiff erection out with a harsh groan.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to take my time with you, when I finally got my hands on you again, but I can\u2019t wait. Unbutton your blouse. I want to tear it too badly to touch it.\u201d As he spoke, he was inching my skirt up over my hips. It was a little stretchy, luckily. I thought that he wouldn\u2019t have hesitated to tear it if it wasn\u2019t.</p><p>My panties weren\u2019t so lucky. He gripped the lace in his hands and ripped both sides. I wriggled my lower half while working on the small buttons of my blouse. When I had released the last one, he was pushing my shirt open impatiently. His hands were already on the front clasp of my bra when what he saw made him freeze. My torso was still dotted with the last vestiges of what had been some truly heinous bruising. I saw his hands shake a little as he unclasped my bra. He brushed along the fading marks with just his fingertips.</p><p>\u201cOver a month later, and it still looks like this?\u201d His voice was deep with agitation.</p><p>I turned my face away. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it. I\u2019ve talked about it enough.\u201d</p><p>He gripped my chin, turning my face back to him. His eyes were wild. \u201cI couldn\u2019t stand it if something were to happen to you. Do you understand that? I\u2019ve never felt so powerless or terrified in my life as I did when I watched that ambulance driving away with you, having no clue what had happened, or even if you were alright. And then to find out that some monster had put his hands on you? I want to kill him. I need to protect you.\u201d</p><p>I just set my mouth in a hard line. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I want from you. And I don\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d</p><p>He was kissing me suddenly. It was an angry, passionate kiss. I kissed him back with just as much passion. Just as much anger. He was thrusting into me so fast that I was filled before I knew his intent. I was wet and ready but I was so tight and he was so big that it still caused a delicious friction that bordered on pain.</p><p>I gasped, my head falling back, my eyes closing.</p><p>He gripped my chin, hard. \u201cLook at me,\u201d he ordered.</p><p>I did, watching the fervor in his eyes with a wistful pain that I felt deep in my chest. I would have given anything to have him feel the way he looked at me when he was deep inside of me. He looked at me like I was more dear than his next breath at times, and it was almost more than I could bear.</p><p>His hair trailed over his face and into mine as he leaned his face close. He held my wrists above my head, using his hands as shackles. He moved my wrists into one hand, the other moving to my jeweled collar, tugging at the ring roughly. His thrusts never let up or slowed. \u201cYou\u2019re mine, Bianca. Say it.\u201d</p><p>My words came out as a rough gasp. \u201cI\u2019m yours, James.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome,\u201d he ordered, thrusting so fast and hard that I sobbed as I came.</p><p>He groaned my name again and again as he poured into me.</p><p>Afterwards, he braced himself carefully on his elbows, protecting my still tender chest and ribs.</p><p>He grabbed a clean t-shirt from his open suitcase to wipe me, and then himself. I lay and watched him almost lazily as he changed into a new pair of boxer briefs, jeans, and a soft light gray V-neck shirt.</p><p>He crouched beside me once he\u2019d changed, straightening my clothes almost tenderly.</p><p>\u201cDid I hurt you?\u201d he asked as he buttoned my shirt.</p><p>\u201cMmm, no,\u201d I said. Anything that could be considered pain certainly hadn\u2019t bothered me at the time.</p><p>\u201cNot even your ribs?\u201d He smoothed my shirt as he finished with the buttons.</p><p>I took a deep breath, but no, there was still no pain. \u201cNo, not at all. They finally aren\u2019t bothering me so much. Breathing was a little rough there for awhile.\u201d</p><p>His mouth tightened as he smoothed my skirt back down. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to do any of the rough stuff, if you don\u2019t want. I don\u2019t just mean while you\u2019re healing. I could give that stuff up completely, if it isn\u2019t what you want anymore.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI still want it. Nothing\u2019s changed in that regard. What he did... and what you do, I don\u2019t see them as the same thing. I can\u2019t explain it, but the one helps me cope with the other. Can we not talk about this anymore?\u201d</p><p>He smoothed my hair back from my face, kissing my forehead. \u201cWe need to talk more, not less. About a lot of things. If you would just let me talk to you, we could get things settled between us. I can\u2019t stand this constant uncertainty where you\u2019re concerned.\u201d</p><p>I sat up, feeling a need for some distance.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s make a deal. How about we not talk. I\u2019ll go home with you tonight. I\u2019ll stay at your place. We can do anything you want. You can fuck my brains out all night.\u201d My voice was getting embarrassingly thick, even a hint of accent was coming out. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to talk about the attack, not any part of it.</p> <p>And I don\u2019t want to talk about our relationship, or lack of one.\u201d</p><p>His jaw clenched, but I saw almost immediately that he wouldn\u2019t turn me down.</p><p>\u201cDo we have to go back to the party first?\u201d he finally asked, his mood clearly darker.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said firmly.</p><p>CHAPTER SEVEN</p> <p>We walked back into the building without another word. James gripped my elbow in a proprietary manner.</p><p>We re-joined my group of friends. A few people gave us good natured smirks for our absence, but no one said anything about it.</p><p>James was quiet and withdrawn. I had a hard time enjoying myself when I knew I had put him into his sudden dark mood. He was barely even touching me. It wasn\u2019t until Damien engaged me in conversation that he became suddenly affectionate. Damien was asking me if I had any plans for the next New York layover when I felt James press against my back, wrapping his arms around me very carefully, just under my breasts.</p><p>Contrary man, I thought darkly, as he buried his face in my neck.</p><p>\u201cUm, no, I don\u2019t think so.\u201d I tried to answer Damien, distracted by the mercurial man at my back. He\u2019d pressed his groin against me, and I had no doubts as to what he was thinking about.</p><p>James raised his head at my answer. \u201cI have an event I\u2019d like you to attend with me, if you\u2019re up for it.</p> <p>It\u2019s a formal affair, for charity.\u201d</p><p>I stiffened, bewildered by the offer. It was an about-face for him, asking me to something so public. We had established from the start that we weren\u2019t going to date. It wasn\u2019t what either of us had wanted from each other. I had quickly found myself hurt by the arrangement, but I hadn\u2019t known he\u2019d changed his stance on any of it. When had it changed and why? Or was this just a stunt to show his ownership to Damien?</p><p>\u201cUm, I don\u2019t have anything to wear to something like that,\u201d I said, naming off the first excuse that came into my head.</p><p>His hands started moving along my stomach, stroking. He grabbed my hips, holding me still as he straightened behind me. The motion brought his erection more flush against my butt, and I had to stifle a gasp. I didn\u2019t want anyone to see just what he was doing. I tried my best to look normal, but had no idea if I succeeded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had my dresser select a wardrobe for you, to keep at my place,\u201d he said in a perfectly casual tone.</p><p>\u201cAnd she\u2019ll be there Friday morning to help you either select something from the wardrobe, or find something else. She\u2019ll have a sampling from several designers for you to try on.\u201d</p><p>I blinked, not sure what to think of that. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t-\u201c \u201cIt\u2019s only fair, if I want you to attend a bunch of stuffy affairs with me, that I provide the clothes you\u2019ll need to wear to them. And besides, we\u2019ve already discussed the gift thing exhaustively. If I recall, that was one of the concessions that you actually agreed to.\u201d He was moving against me as he spoke. It was hard to hold on to a thought when he did that.</p><p>\u201cWhen did you do all that? The wardrobe thing?\u201d I asked, baffled.</p> <p>\u201cWeeks ago, when I realized that I was just going to have to get used to the idea that I couldn\u2019t shelter you from the paparazzi, so I might as well show you off.\u201d</p><p>I just blinked.</p><p>Damien was looking between us, studying James. I had almost forgotten, for a few minutes, that he was even there. James had that effect on me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll come with me, won\u2019t you?\u201d James murmured in my ear.</p><p>He wrapped his arms around my shoulders, his arms moving slowly, rubbing against my nipples. There was no way that he wasn\u2019t aware he was touching them. They were hard little pebbles that he had to feel through the material of my thin shirt and lacy bra.</p><p>\u201cI, um, I don\u2019t know. The invitation is unexpected, as I\u2019m sure you know. I\u2019ve never been to anything like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to it. We just get dressed up and walk around, mingling. I won\u2019t leave your side, if you\u2019re nervous. I just want your company.\u201d</p><p>Damien walked away, likely feeling ignored. He made his way to Murphy, who was telling a story loud enough for the entire room to hear.</p><p>I pitched my voice low, speaking over my shoulder. \u201cI thought we weren\u2019t doing any of that. You said from the beginning that we weren\u2019t dating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d talk to you about it, but I\u2019m not allowed to talk tonight, remember?\u201d His deep voice was a rumble against my ear.</p><p>I saw his game. He wanted to get me curious enough to take back my own words. I wouldn\u2019t do it, though, even if my curiosity was eating at me.</p><p>I poked an elbow behind me. \u201cFine then, let\u2019s not talk about any events either, while we\u2019re at it. That raises too many questions about our relationship.\u201d</p><p>He made a displeased little hum behind me that I could feel rumble through me. He didn\u2019t speak for several minutes. I had to bite my tongue to keep from asking him questions.</p><p>Finally he broke his silence. \u201cDo you like horses?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cHorses?\u201d I asked, baffled.</p><p>\u201cYes, horses. Do you like them?\u201d</p><p>I thought about it. More about why he was asking then what he was asking. Finally, I just focused on the question. \u201cYes, I like horses. Doesn\u2019t everyone? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you ridden?\u201d</p><p>I flushed. \u201cOnce. It was just a two-hour guided tour, up in the mountains, so I\u2019m not even sure it counts, but I loved it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think you feel well enough to try riding now? Or do you need to heal up more?\u201d</p><p>I cast him a suspicious glance. \u201cDo you have horses in town?\u201d I hadn\u2019t noticed any stables at his property, but I also hadn\u2019t exactly gotten a proper tour.</p><p>\u201cI do. I need to show you the entire property sometime, including the stables. They\u2019re set away from the house. But that isn\u2019t what I had in mind. You said I could do whatever I wanted with you. You didn\u2019t give me any restrictions, including staying in town. I would take you to the beach, to relax, but I find that lately I absolutely despise the beach.\u201d</p><p>I raised my brows at him. \u201cYou don\u2019t like the beach?\u201d I asked him, baffled.</p><p>He set his jaw and looked across the room with a steely glare. I followed his eyes. He was staring at Damien as though he wanted to do the man bodily harm.</p><p>\u201cCurrently, just the thought of the beach makes me want to do violence,\u201d he said, his tone quiet but ominous. \u201cSo I have another idea, if you\u2019re up to try some riding.\u201d</p><p>I studied him, trying to follow his odd thought patterns. \u201cWhere did you want to take me?\u201d</p><p>He turned that steely glare on me. \u201cYou said I could do anything with you tonight. And you did not say I had to tell you what or where. All I want to know is, do you think you can ride a horse?\u201d</p><p>I glared back. \u201cI\u2019m not sure. I feel okay. If I didn\u2019t do anything too crazy, and it was a calm horse, I suppose I could.\u201d</p><p>He nodded decisively. \u201cOkay, we\u2019ll take it easy. Let me make some phone calls.\u201d</p><p>I watched him walk outside, a little stunned by the sudden turn of events.</p><p>He always seemed to do that, turn everything around until I was dizzy and panting and giving into his whims without a protest. It was infuriating, and exhilarating. I had thought my life was content and full before I met him. I had thought that excitement was the last thing that I wanted for myself. And the thought of falling in love had been anathema to me. How could meeting one person make everything change so suddenly? I wondered, not for the first time. I didn\u2019t know where he was planning to take me, but it didn\u2019t matter. I would go. My self-control became an elusive quality when I got into James\u2019s orbit.</p><p>I approached Stephan, listening to the long-winded story Murphy was into before I was noticed. He was walking everyone through the horror of waking up with two women and a new tattoo with one of their names on it. Only he hadn\u2019t remembered either of their names, just that one of them was Lola, since it was written in big black letters on his chest.</p><p>I blinked at the ridiculous story. Surprisingly, I hadn\u2019t heard it before, though I had seen the tattoo when he was lounging by the pool. I listened, as interested as everyone else to find out which woman the tattoo was for, and why.</p><p>\u201cTurns out, it was another woman I\u2019d met earlier that night. She\u2019d left in a jealous rage after the tattoo, when I started talking to the two I woke up with. I was just being friendly, I\u2019m sure!\u201d</p><p>His defensive stance about two women he\u2019d woken up in bed with made everyone laugh. He was still genuinely offended by the woman who\u2019d inspired his tattoo and never spoken to him again.</p><p>Four other pilots had joined the group. I recognized them only vaguely. They were part of the younger generation of pilots, and I knew they were friends with Damien and Murphy, but I couldn\u2019t recall any of their names.</p><p>\u201cHe calls her the one that got away every time he gets really trashed,\u201d Damien said in an amused voice, making me start. He was just behind me.</p><p>I turned to give him a slight smile.</p><p>His voice was pitched loud enough for the large group to hear, but he seemed to be speaking to me. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t even remember her, but he says he trusts even his drunk judgement enough that, if she inspired a tattoo in one night, she must have been \u2018the one.\u2019 Every time he goes on a rant about how he hates being single, he blames Lola\u2019s damned temper.\u201d</p><p>I looked at Murphy, laughing. He had a sheepish, good natured-grin on his face. It sounded like something he\u2019d say, and he didn\u2019t deny it.</p><p>\u201cWhere was this?\u201d I asked him.</p><p>\u201cMelbourne, Australia. I bet she had a sexy accent,\u201d Murphy said in a dejected tone.</p><p>\u201cWe all know how much you love sexy Australian accents,\u201d one of the pilots added, sending everyone into new peals of laughter.</p><p>\u201cHey, now.\u201d Damien said, raising his hands. \u201cDon\u2019t drag me into this. I\u2019ve been with Murphy for years, and he has yet to get a tattoo for me on any part of his body, sexy accent or no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow we know for sure he\u2019s never slept with you,\u201d Marnie interjected. \u201cIf he had, there would be a Damien tattoo somewhere on his body, I can attest. One night, and I had to check the urge not to brand you on my ass.\u201d</p><p>Loud hoots and hollers followed her brazen announcement, Murphy laughing the loudest. His laugh was particularly infectious. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I had to give Damien a second look. I\u2019d have sworn he was blushing.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think I haven\u2019t tried,\u201d Murphy gasped out, still laughing. \u201cHe\u2019s just about the prettiest man I know. Prettier than at least half the women I\u2019ve been with. But I can\u2019t even get a cuddle when he\u2019s drunk.\u201d</p><p>Our laughter was loud enough that even in the boisterous bar, most of the people were staring our way.</p><p>That was about the time James strode back inside.</p> <p>I was standing closest to Damien, though we were still a good two feet apart. And I couldn\u2019t stop laughing, even seeing the storm that immediately overtook his lovely features at the sight of us standing near each other again.</p><p>I knew that he had a problem with Damien. He seemed to think there was something between us. I just didn\u2019t understand why. I\u2019d known Damien for years before I\u2019d met James. If we had shared a real interest in each other, obviously something would have happened by now. I understood Damien\u2019s appeal, but he just didn\u2019t do it for me. I had more...exotic tastes. I thought that all should have been very obvious to James, so it was hard to humor his strange dislike for one of my good friends.</p><p>James strode to me, looking much too fine even in a pique.</p><p>I marveled, as I did much too often, at how beautiful he was. His longish, sandy brown hair fell artfully out of his face as he walked. The chiseled muscles of his arms and upper body were clearly defined by his thin shirt. His clenched jawline was perfection. His mouth was almost bow shaped but held too firm of an edge to be pouty, though it sure was pretty. His arched eyebrows and thick lashes were a shade darker than his hair, drawing attention to his vivid turquoise eyes. His nose was straight and flared appealingly at the tip, sitting just right in his unrivaled face. He was simply beautiful. He was in no way feminine, but the word handsome just couldn\u2019t do those refined looks justice. He was long and lean, but in tight fitting clothing, it was clear that he was well muscled, rather than thin. He\u2019s perfection, I thought absently. What is he doing with me? Was always my follow up question.</p><p>He moved in close beside me, but didn\u2019t touch me.</p> <p>\u201cLooks like I missed all the fun,\u201d he said quietly to me, his voice strangely empty.</p><p>My smile began to fade.</p><p>\u201cThe arrangements have been made,\u201d he said shortly. \u201cYou\u2019re all mine, whenever we finish up here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you two? You look like you\u2019re hot enough about each other to break out the ink. When are you going to tattoo your names on each other?\u201d Marnie called out to James and I, smiling and wiggling her eyebrows suggestively.</p><p>I sent him a sidelong smile.</p><p>He gave me the tiniest smile in return. \u201cIt would be a waste to mar her perfect skin just for a little ink,\u201d</p> <p>James said. \u201cBut I would happily get a Bianca tattoo, if that\u2019s what she wants.\u201d</p><p>I arched a brow at him as the crowd erupted, shouting encouragement for the folly. I\u2019d seen James\u2019s body. He didn\u2019t have one tattoo, so he was just messing with them, of course.</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t return the favor, Bianca?\u201d Judith called out, sounding aghast.</p><p>I shrugged, giving James a narrow-eyed glare. \u201cI guess if he got a tattoo for me, I\u2019d let him pierce my nipples,\u201d I said more to him than the crowd. But the crowd absolutely roared at the joke.</p><p>He ran his tongue over his teeth in that mouthwatering way of his. He held out a hand to me, as though to shake. \u201cYou have a deal, Love. Please, shake on it. Nothing would please me more.\u201d</p><p>Someone sounded like they choked on their drink just behind me. I heard Stephan shouting something along the lines of, \u201cWhat the fuck, Buttercup?\u201d</p><p>I looked at his hand, wondering why he had to take the joke so far. But I shook his hand without giving it much thought, just going along with his over the top antics. One of Murphy\u2019s favorite lines about telling jokes came to mind, for some reason. Always go with the bit, he liked to say. Can\u2019t deny the bit.</p><p>\u201cYou first, though. I want to see that ink before I pierce anything,\u201d I said, making sure I had insurance, just in case he really had gone crazy.</p> <p>He smiled, and it was positively wicked. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I want to see those piercings, Bee!\u201d someone called out. I couldn\u2019t even tell who it was.</p><p>\u201cWe want to see, as proof that you both held up your end of the bargain!\u201d I recognized Judith\u2019s voice that time.</p><p>\u201cYou should put her name on your cock, in that case!\u201d Marnie called out. She got enough of a shocked response to call out, \u201cToo far? Was that one too far?\u201d</p><p>James threw an arm around my shoulder, anchoring me close against his side. \u201cNo one gets to see her piercings, but I\u2019ll show the tattoo. Bianca can even pick which part of my body she wants to mark.\u201d</p><p>The joke had gone on long enough. I pulled back to give him a stern look, opening my mouth to speak.</p><p>He pressed his hot mouth against mine before I could get a word out. He kissed me, a hot, not fit for public, kind of kiss. His tongue swept deep into my mouth, just begging me to suck it. I pushed against his chest at first, having every intention of avoiding his need for PDA. His hand fisted in my hair, the other hand going to my lower back to press me firmly against him.</p><p>I struggled for only a moment before I was lost, softening against him, sucking at his tongue like my life depended on it. My hands fisted helplessly in his shirt, my wrists aching for the feel of the restraining pressure that I craved.</p><p>I forgot about my friends, forgot about the joke he\u2019d taken too far. He could have taken me there, against the wall, if he\u2019d wanted to. That was his power over me.</p><p>He was the one to pull back, smiling. He looked over my head, and I knew he was grinning at Damien, a cold, triumphant grin.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t pick a spot, I might just have to take the only other suggestion I heard, something about your name on my cock.\u201d He spoke loudly enough to get some hoots and hollers from the crowd.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t even form the words to respond. He took one of my fisted hands, spreading it flat over his heart.</p><p>\u201cOr how about right there, Love?\u201d he whispered to me.</p><p>I licked my lips, opening my mouth to speak. I knew I should say...something, but my mind had just gone off into space. Off into, thinking about the things he could do to me, territory. He laughed, clearly enjoying the state he\u2019d put me in.</p><p>He was smug and gloating as he stroked a hand over my hair. I couldn\u2019t bring myself to care. I was soon to be at his mercy for the night. The thought was all-consuming. I was excited, and aroused, and scared.</p><p>Was it too soon, since my injuries? Would I bring back some of the shadow pains that had so recently faded? Would he take it easy on me, or push me hard? I wanted to know the answers more than I feared the pain.</p><p>One thing I knew for certain. He was going to fuck me mindless, and I could barely stand the wait.</p><p>CHAPTER EIGHT</p><p>\u201cAre you ready to leave yet?\u201d James murmured to me a few minutes later.</p><p>We\u2019d grown silent as the group moved on to another topic. James was stroking me lightly, touching me everywhere, falling just short of indecency.</p><p>He would touch my collarbone, but stop just short of my breasts. One hand lingered at my hipbone, dangerously close to dipping low enough to be obscene. I was getting more and more lost in his touch, losing all sense of what was appropriate, and losing sight of all of the reasons that I\u2019d ever had any reservations about him at all.</p><p>This was the reason I had tried to keep my distance from him, but also the reason that I couldn\u2019t. I simply couldn\u2019t resist him. I had held out for a time, but if I was honest, it had only been a countdown to my capitulation.</p><p>I didn\u2019t answer him, and he took it as a challenge. He kissed me again, holding nothing back this time.</p><p>He was gripping my hair almost to the point of pain, his other hand grabbing my butt as he ground against me. He was aroused and I moaned into his mouth, the sound barely registering in my lust fueled haze.</p><p>He pulled back, his breath ragged now. \u201cYou ready to leave now? I don\u2019t find the idea of fucking you against that wall behind you even slightly unpleasant. Exhibitionism has never been a problem for me. Is that something you\u2019d like to try?\u201d</p><p>He ground against me with every word he spoke, and his voice was mocking, almost angry. His words were barely registering, as my focus was on what he was doing.</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d Was all I managed to get out.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready to leave now? Or would you prefer that I fuck you in front of all of your co-workers?\u201d</p><p>James bit out in a hard enough tone to finally bring my mind back to the surface.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, breathless and agitated.</p><p>How could I so quickly forget where I am, and that we\u2019re in a room crowded with people that I know?</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not ready to leave? Or no, you wouldn\u2019t prefer that I fuck you in a room crowded with your friends? Where they can all watch me bury my cock inside of you against that wall, not ten feet behind you. Is that something you want them to see?\u201d</p><p>I just stared at him for awhile, my mind moving like molasses.</p><p>He seemed to be getting angrier by the moment. \u201cAnswer me. Do you want me to do that?\u201d he asked, each word biting and harsh.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, shaking my head. \u201cNo,\u201d I repeated, trying to make it sound convincing. \u201cWe need to go.\u201d</p><p>He ground his teeth together. \u201cI\u2019m aware of that. Go say goodbye to Stephan,\u201d he ordered.</p><p>I stepped away from him, catching my breath for long moments.</p><p>I counted in my head as I made my way to Stephan, trying to get my mind onto the matter at hand, and off of James.</p><p>Stephan gave me a slightly worried look as I approached. \u201cYou okay, Bee?\u201d He leaned near my ear as he spoke.</p><p>I just nodded, looking only at him. \u201cJames and I are leaving. I\u2019m going home with him. I\u2019ll call you tomorrow,\u201d I told him.</p><p>He began to look around as I spoke, searching for James. He met the other man\u2019s stare as James approached. James leaned in, saying something in his ear, pitched too low for even me to hear.</p><p>Stephan nodded slowly, giving the other man a severe frown, but saying nothing.</p><p>James led me from the room by the hand, his own grip uncompromising. We didn\u2019t speak to anyone else. I was lucid enough to know I should be a little embarrassed at how far I\u2019d almost let James go in a room full of people.</p><p>James was close to dragging me by the time we got to his car. He ushered me, rather forcefully, into the low limo the second Clark opened the door. He was a hard presence at my back as I moved across the seats. He sat close to me, but made no move to touch me again. I didn\u2019t mind, taking the reprieve to try to compose myself.</p><p>Several minutes passed in silence, James staring out the window as though he was avoiding even the sight of me. I could tell he was angry, but I couldn\u2019t even begin to guess why.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve done that before?\u201d I finally asked him quietly. My mind had been stubbornly lingering on the idea in the long silence. \u201cYou\u2019ve had sex in front of other people before?\u201d</p><p>He looked at me, his brow arched, his expression cold. \u201cYes. Are we sharing information now? I thought that was strictly off-limits tonight. Your idea, if I recall.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My eyes narrowed on him. \u201cDon\u2019t bring things up that you aren\u2019t willing to talk about, then.\u201d</p><p>His brows flew straight up at that. \u201cIs that a rule now? So you\u2019re saying that if you bring up a subject, you have to answer my questions about it, as well? If you\u2019ll agree to reciprocate, I\u2019ll accept those terms.\u201d</p><p>I bit my lip, wondering how this was going to backfire on me. I knew it would, eventually. How badly did I want to know about his exhibitionist tendencies?</p><p>Badly. \u201cFine. Tell me.\u201d</p> <p>He pursed that pretty mouth. \u201cTell you what, exactly? About having sex in front of other people?\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>\u201cIs it something you\u2019re interested in doing, or are you merely curious?\u201d</p><p>My eyes widened in dawning horror. Had he thought I would want to do that in front of my co-workers, if I was thinking at all clearly? The thought was abhorrent.</p><p>\u201cMerely curious,\u201d I said with a blush. \u201cAbout you more than the practice. I want to know what you did in front of other people, and with whom.\u201d</p> <p>He spread his hands. \u201cI\u2019ve done it several times. There are...events for people like us. BDSM demonstrations. I\u2019ve dominated, and spanked, and fucked several women at things like that. In front of a few people or even crowds. I never had a problem with it, though it was more a novelty than one of my actual preferences. And I fucked a few women at some frat houses in college in front of crowds, a few times on a dare, if I recall. I wasn\u2019t exaggerating when I said I used to be a real slut. I\u2019ve been more circumspect in recent years, but only in comparison to my past exploits, really. Anything else you want to know about it?\u201d His voice was tight with agitation by the end of his explanation, and his question was downright angry.</p><p>I felt sick to my stomach suddenly, the last vestiges of arousal leaving me completely. \u201cAnd you\u2019d have no problem doing that to me, in front of a crowd?\u201d</p><p>His jaw clenched hard, and he turned his head away. He was silent for so long that I didn\u2019t think he was going to answer, though the answer was important to me.</p><p>\u201cI have a huge problem with it,\u201d he said finally. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean I wouldn\u2019t do it. Even knowing how much I would have regretted it after, I still had a hard time stopping myself. I felt like you wanted me to, and that made it so hard to stop. I\u2019m starting to see that that\u2019s not what you wanted. Still, I would have been furious with us both if it had gone that far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy furious? You said yourself you\u2019ve done it several times.\u201d</p><p>He gave me an almost malevolent glare. \u201cBecause you\u2019re mine. I don\u2019t want other people to see you like that. I don\u2019t want to share you like that. When I\u2019ve done it before, it\u2019s been with women who were...dispensable. They were all dispensable, Bianca. I\u2019m not proud of that fact, but it is the truth.</p> <p>Even the few subs who I\u2019ve had under contract longterm were dispensable, in a way. I never shared them, but I certainly didn\u2019t care if anyone saw me fucking them.\u201d</p><p>I licked my lips. \u201cYou had subs under contract? Longterm?\u201d I asked, feeling the sickness growing.</p><p>He sighed. \u201cI did bring it up, didn\u2019t I? Yes, I\u2019ve had a few subs under contract. They were amenable, though only two were compatible for what could be considered longterm. It can be a necessary arrangement, when you have a lot of money and your sexual proclivities are...unusual. I wanted no misunderstandings, and certainly none of them were strangers to the scene.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that something you would try to do to me? The contract thing?\u201d I asked him, my voice smaller than I preferred.</p><p>He gave me a baffled, wild look.</p><p>I had a horrible thought. I hadn\u2019t wanted the arrangement, would certainly have turned it down, but what occurred to me next was even more appalling.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I said, the sick knot in my stomach growing by the moment. \u201cThat\u2019s a more longterm arrangement than what you had in mind for me, I take it.\u201d I made my voice and face empty of emotion as I spoke, wanting to take the blow with some grace. \u201cYou would obviously want someone more experienced with the things you like, to fill a role like that. Well, that\u2019s for the best. I couldn\u2019t make a commitment like that, anyways.\u201d</p><p>His head dropped forward, his hair covering his face. I saw his fists clenching and unclenching.</p> <p>He was silent for a time. His voice was low but harsh with intensity when he spoke. \u201cThat is not the contract that I had in mind for you. But which is it, Bianca? Are we talking about our relationship, or am I not allowed? Because you keep saying the most infuriating things, and I\u2019m finding it increasingly difficult to bite my tongue. So are we talking about our relationship tonight, or not? I\u2019ve wanted to explain myself to you for a long time, but you always run away before I can even begin.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed. I suddenly wanted to know, quite desperately, what he would say if I encouraged this conversation. But I lost my nerve, feeling terrified enough of what he might say to postpone it for another day.</p><p>\u201cNot tonight,\u201d I said finally.</p><p>A chilly silence filled the car after that. He didn\u2019t move, didn\u2019t speak, didn\u2019t touch. I withdrew into my own thoughts, for a time. We stayed that way until we pulled into the parking lot of Las Vegas\u2019s private airport. It was close to the main airport, but I\u2019d never actually been to it.</p><p>\u201cWhat are we doing?\u201d I asked James.</p><p>He didn\u2019t look up. \u201cYou said I could do anything with you that I wanted. I am.\u201d</p><p>I gave him an exasperated look that he didn\u2019t see. \u201cI don\u2019t have anything with me. I haven\u2019t even packed a bag. And it\u2019s late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve taken care of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will be morning by the time we get anywhere. I can\u2019t wear this outfit anywhere but a night club.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I said I\u2019ve taken care of it.\u201d</p><p>We had stopped by then, and Clark was opening the door scant seconds later. James got out in a flash, pulling me out as soon as I got within his reach. He gripped my elbow firmly, guiding me into the small terminal.</p><p>\u201cWe should be able to depart immediately,\u201d he said brusquely.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to tell me where we\u2019re going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Not to a beach. I\u2019ll tell you that much.\u201d</p><p>I nearly laughed. \u201cWhat is your issue with beaches? Everyone loves the beach.\u201d I looked at him, smiling to draw him out of his mood.</p><p>His face darkened. \u201cI\u2019m aware,\u201d he said, his tone scathing. The beach was a topic off-limits, I noted. I tucked away that little piece of information.</p><p>\u201cI need a change of clothes,\u201d I complained.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m aware,\u201d he repeated.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the moodiest person I\u2019ve ever met,\u201d I told him, my own tone dark now.</p><p>He squeezed my arm, hard. \u201cYou make me crazy. If you would give me some clue what you were thinking or feeling, if you even feel anything for me, I think I could handle our situation with a little less volatility.\u201d</p><p>His words struck me silent, and we walked like that through the smaller airport. We went through all of the motions, my mind reeling.</p><p>He wanted to know if I felt anything for him? It was a strange notion to me, one I couldn\u2019t credit. He\u2019s worried about getting me to care for him? I mused.</p><p>I dismissed the thought after mulling it over. I\u2019d had this type of interaction with men before. It wasn\u2019t that he cared. It was that I came across just aloof enough that it made me a challenge. James couldn\u2019t have felt challenged to gain the affection of many women. One night with him, and most probably professed undying love. Because, frankly, there was so much to l ove. But I wouldn\u2019t humor him, not at the cost of what little pride I intended to retain at the end of our affair.</p><p>CHAPTER NINE</p><p>We were boarding his jet in record time. I\u2019d never been on a private jet before, and his was impressive.</p><p>I studied the beautifully designed interior, keeping my features schooled into passivity as the flight attendant greeted us warmly.</p><p>He led me directly to a seat, buckling me in without a word, his mouth tight. We hadn\u2019t spoken since his odd statement, and I didn\u2019t know what to say.</p><p>He sat beside me in an oversized leather chair, buckling himself in. The seats made my airline\u2019s first class seats look tiny in comparison.</p><p>\u201cThe decor is lovely. Your decorators, as always, have exquisite taste,\u201d I told him. The plane\u2019s interior was done up in a muted red color with deep brown accents. I wouldn\u2019t have even known it was a plane, if I\u2019d only seen the interior.</p><p>\u201cWell, thank you. I decorate most of it myself,\u201d he told me, flushing a little.</p><p>I was surprised. \u201cThat\u2019s...impressive.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, looking uncomfortable. \u201cI own hotels. It always made sense to me, that I should have a hand in all of it, so I\u2019ve been making many of the decorating decisions since I was a teenager. It goes without saying that I choose my own decor on my private properties. I like things a particular way.\u201d</p><p>I flushed a little at that. He was a control freak, was what he should have said. Strangely, that thought only ever turned me on. \u201cDo you enjoy interior design? Or is it merely a necessary evil for you?\u201d</p><p>He looked thoughtful. \u201cI enjoy it. If I\u2019m honest, I even enjoy shopping. Do you think less of me now?\u201d</p><p>I gave him a tiny, teasing smile. \u201cHardly. I far prefer these revelations to ones about you being an exhibitionist.\u201d</p><p>He had begun to smile, and just like that, it died. He grew broodingly silent again as the plane was prepped and we took off.</p><p>\u201cDo you think you\u2019ll be able to accept my past? Or is it all just too sordid for you?\u201d he finally asked quietly. His head was tilted back as he rested in his chair.</p><p>I blinked. \u201cI suppose, as long as it is actually in the past, I could cope with it, if you\u2019re always honest with me.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, looking relieved, but oddly sad. \u201cI will be. I have been. I\u2019ve gone out of my way to tell you even the things I don\u2019t want to, because you asked it of me. You just need to give me some time to prove it to you. To gain your trust.\u201d</p><p>I thought about that as he went silent again.</p><p>The flight attendant was attentive, asking us if we needed anything mere seconds after we reached ten thousand feet.</p><p>She was beautiful, I noticed. Her hair was long and black, hanging straight down her back and parted down the middle, her features stunning. She had a slim but shapely figure. Her uniform was a plain black skirt with a fitted, almost too tight white dress shirt tucked in. She wore four inch red stilettos that she worked like a pro. I couldn\u2019t have walked in those shoes to save my life.</p><p>I remembered James\u2019s offer to hire me as his personal flight attendant. Was that how she had gotten the job? Did I want to know? The masochistic side of me certainly did.</p><p>\u201cHave you slept with Helene?\u201d I asked James, my tone very nearly idle.</p><p>He studied me. He hesitated, and I had my answer.</p><p>I looked out the window.</p><p>\u201cOnce, when she first hired on,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cShe offered rather blatantly, and I accepted. We\u2019ve been nothing but professional in the years since. Are you upset?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIs she a submissive?\u201d I asked.</p><p>I heard his breath puff out in a frustrated sigh.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s almost as if you\u2019re toying with me, hinting that you might be jealous. I shouldn\u2019t hold my breath, huh? No, she is not. We weren\u2019t compatible in that way. I didn\u2019t even consider it. As I said, it was years ago. I was more promiscuous then. She was beautiful and amenable, and it was enough, at the time.\u201d</p><p>Ick, ick, ick, I was thinking. Ouch, ouch, ouch, was what I was feeling. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem very professional, sleeping with your employees like that,\u201d I said stiffly.</p> <p>He covered my hand with his own. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t. I don\u2019t do anything like that anymore, even before I met you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill we be running into women you\u2019ve slept with everywhere we go?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He squeezed my hand. \u201cNot everywhere, but occasionally, yes. If it bothers you too much, I could let her go, or reassign her. I hate to make you uncomfortable.\u201d</p><p>I looked to where the flight attendant worked in her tiny galley. She had been nothing but professional and efficient.</p><p>\u201cDoes she hit on you anymore?\u201d I asked.</p> <p>\u201cNo. I told her quite clearly after the first time that it would not be happening again. She took it with grace. She is a real professional. But I will accommodate you, however you like. I want you in my life, and I will make any concessions needed to see that happen. Do I need to let her go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d I said, not looking at him. If we were having sex, he never would have allowed my looking away from him in such a way. He never would have allowed the distance it gave me. But, for whatever reason, he seemed to be giving me the control outside of the bedroom. \u201cShe seems to be good at her job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s quite good. And always available to fly at a moment\u2019s notice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you taking me?\u201d I asked him, changing the subject. Talking about and looking at the other woman was depressing me, for obvious reasons.</p><p>\u201cWyoming,\u201d he answered.</p><p>I blinked at him.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a fairly short flight, but there\u2019s a bed in the back, if you want to get a little sleep. There\u2019s also clothes and toiletries for you,\u201d James went on.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s in Wyoming?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cI have a horse ranch there. It\u2019s very secluded and peaceful. I thought it might be a nice reprieve for us, for a day or two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to work?\u201d I asked him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m grooming a North American manager to take over some of my duties. I have micro-managed my businesses for too long, I\u2019m recently realizing. I have a man who I believe is capable, so he should certainly be able to handle things for a few days. I need to be able to have a life outside of work. For once, I actually want that. So this will be a test for him. When I want to take a few days, or even a few weeks off, I want to leave things in capable hands.\u201d</p><p>I hadn\u2019t expected my casual question to elicit such an in-depth answer. He always surprised me, and unwillingly, I felt some of my walls weakening.</p><p>\u201cI have to be back to work thursday night,\u201d I told him.</p><p>He smiled at me, his mood lightened. \u201cYes, I know.\u201d</p> <p>I realized I was tired enough to sleep with a sudden yawn.</p><p>James saw, giving me a hooded look. \u201cReady to go to bed?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cAre you tired?\u201d I asked him, about to tell him he didn\u2019t have to join me if he wasn\u2019t.</p><p>His eyes seared me. \u201cLove, I\u2019ve been waiting for weeks to see you. Sleep is the last thing on my mind.\u201d As he spoke, he unbuckled me, pulling me to my feet and leading me to the back of the plane, without further ado.</p><p>Just before we reached the closed door at the back, he let go of my hand, reaching up to the ring on my choker, hooking a finger inside. He didn\u2019t even glance back at me, but I felt a change in him.</p><p>He opened the door, pulling me into a surprisingly large bedroom. He led me around the room, showing me where I could find the things I\u2019d need. Half of the clothes in the closet were women\u2019s clothes. Dare I ask? \u201cWill those fit me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would hope so,\u201d he answered in an icy tone. \u201cI had my shopper buy them for you, and she had all of your measurements.\u201d</p><p>The bathroom was tiny, but held the essential toiletries that I might need.</p><p>He was unbuttoning my blouse, his chest against my back, before we\u2019d finished the short tour. He pulled it off my arms, unsnapping my front clasping bra with one swift motion. He had my skirt unzipped and falling to my feet in a flash.</p><p>Unexpectedly, he bit down between my neck and shoulder, right on the tendon, hard enough to make me jerk. He sucked on the wound he\u2019d made, and I moaned.</p><p>\u201cLeave the shoes on. Lie down on your back, and spread your legs,\u201d he ordered.</p><p>I obeyed.</p><p>He pulled restraints from under the mattress, fastening my wrists, and then my ankles. I felt a sensual haze overtake me as I gazed at him. I was spellbound as I watched him undress.</p><p>He shrugged out of his shirt in one smooth motion. I held my breath as he undid the button and zipper of his pants, releasing his erection. He pushed them to the floor, stepping out of them and immediately stepping up to the bed.</p><p>He studied me for long minutes, his intense eyes drinking me in, as though memorizing the sight.</p><p>\u201cI missed you,\u201d he said, his voice a harsh whisper, and I believed him.</p><p>He crawled onto the foot of the bed, burying his face between my legs before I saw his intent.</p><p>I gasped as he licked at me with long, perfect strokes. He sucked at my clitoris and I whimpered. He had me on the brink of orgasm in seconds, but pulled back suddenly, going back to slowly licking me.</p><p>\u201cJames, please,\u201d I begged him.</p><p>I got no response, just the slowest lick along my core.</p><p>\u201cMr. Cavendish, please,\u201d I tried again.</p><p>He moved up my body, licking and sucking at my naval. He spent drawn-out minutes at my breasts, sucking hard on my nipples for endless minutes, kneading at my full breasts, until that alone had me close to the edge. He stopped short there, as well.</p><p>I sobbed.</p><p>He left no part of my exposed body untouched, rubbing, pinching, sucking, biting. It was the most exquisite torture.</p><p>His heavy arousal dragged along my body as he moved, and I tugged hard at my restraints, trying to get closer to that part of him. I pulled so hard at them that my hands and feet began to go numb, but James never let up.</p><p>I tried begging again. \u201cI beg you, Mr. Cavendish.\u201d</p><p>He ignored the words, never speaking, never letting up.</p><p>\u201cAre you punishing me, Mr. Cavendish?\u201d I finally cried.</p><p>\u201cOf course I am,\u201d he murmured against my skin, and there was steal in his voice. \u201cI can\u2019t whip you.</p><p>This is the alternative. Do you prefer the whipping?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said without hesitation. There was no comparison in my mind. One liberated me, and the other made me feel desperate and exposed. Tears seeped down my cheeks as he relentlessly worked on my body.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I asked breathlessly.</p><p>He thrust two fingers into me suddenly, and my back bowed on a gasp.</p><p>His own breathing was harsh as he spoke, stroking me purposefully. \u201cJust to give you a taste. I was desperate for you. To comfort you, to tend to you. Hell, just to look at you. But you withdrew from me completely, until I was pathetically grateful for just a text from you, and even that you withheld most of the time. So I needed to give you at least a small taste of the wanting.\u201d He worked his fingers along just the perfect spot as he spoke.</p><p>I was tensing with my approaching orgasm when he pulled his fingers out.</p><p>I screamed in frustration.</p><p>He kissed me. It was a bruising kiss, and I tasted myself on his mouth. He plundered my mouth as he positioned himself above me. I began to whimper loudly as I felt his cock right at my entrance. He teased, rubbing in circles there. I tried to thrust up at him, but merely served to further strangle my ankles in the process.</p><p>\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry I did that,\u201d I told him finally. \u201cYou scare me. The way I feel about you scares me, so I ran.\u201d</p><p>He thrust inside of me as I spoke.</p><p>I screamed. He moaned.</p><p>He propped himself on his elbows, thrusting furiously, but holding my gaze with his own. He tugged on the loop of diamonds on my collar as he thrust, and I felt the pull there, the connection that it symbolized.</p><p>\u201cNothing in my life has ever felt as perfect as being inside of you,\u201d he gasped out, cupping my face, his punishing pace never letting up. \u201cCome, Love,\u201d he ordered.</p><p>I did. \u201cJames,\u201d I cried, and I watched his eyes as his own release took him.</p><p>The way he looked at me then made me want to cry with longing. If I was foolish enough to believe that look, I\u2019d be lost forever.</p><p>CHAPTER TEN</p><p>I was already on the edge of sleep when he undid my restraints. I heard first a pained noise escape his throat, then a harsh string of cursing. It brought me back from sleep enough to open my eyes. He was studying the marks the ropes had left on my skin. I couldn\u2019t even feel the marks that were apparently bothering him, so I just closed my eyes, and drifted off.</p><p>He was sliding panties up my legs when I awoke. He was already dressed in a fresh white T-shirt and jeans.</p><p>I felt surprisingly good as I sat up. He\u2019d laid a T-shirt, jeans, and a bra for me on the bed.</p><p>\u201cYou can pick something else, if you prefer. There\u2019s plenty to choose from in the closet,\u201d he told me, and strode from the room, closing the door with a loud click behind him.</p><p>I went into the small bathroom to change. I freshened up in a hurry, pulling the jeans on, pleased to find that they actually fit. They were the right size. They were even long enough, which was rare. They were Diesel brand, which I\u2019d never worn, but I quickly became a fan. They were bootcut and hugged my butt just perfectly, with a little bit of stretch in the material. The dark wash was flattering. I was impressed with his dresser\u2019s success at picking out jeans for me, a task that usually made me want to gnash my teeth in frustration.</p><p>I shrugged into the white t-shirt. It was soft and thin, with a small pocket right over my left breast. It was much more tight than something I would have chosen for myself, but beggars couldn\u2019t be choosers. I fingered the lovely collar at my throat, clearly visible with the T-shirt\u2019s neckline. I noticed for the first time that my earrings from the night before were missing. James must have removed them, and I had no idea where they were. I made a note to ask him about it.</p><p>I saw that he\u2019d laid out navy running shoes for me by the door. As I slid them on, I noted that they looked oddly familiar. I was still staring at them as the door opened and a matching men\u2019s pair of them came into view.</p><p>\u201cWe have matching shoes?\u201d I asked him, and I couldn\u2019t keep back a smirk.</p><p>He pulled me against him, rubbing my back and then my butt. \u201cShoes and shirts, and the jeans are pretty damn close.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cIs this a fetish of some kind? You like to match?\u201d</p><p>He smoothed my hair back, tilting my face up as he began to braid it. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t deliberate, exactly. I just saw that you had things similar to mine, and unconsciously picked them out. I kind of like it, though. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>No one could doubt that we\u2019re together when we\u2019re dressed like this.\u201d He finished braiding my hair, using a hair tie from his wrist to tie it off.</p><p>He fingered my thick metal collar, his eyes soft. He surprised my by pulling a small box from his pocket. It looked like a small ring box.</p><p>My breath caught, my mind going a little panicky at what it might contain. I was almost relieved when he revealed the large, square cut, light blue gem stud earrings. They were beautiful and unexpected, and I was stunned enough to let him put them on me without protest. Foolishly, I\u2019d had a horrifying moment where I thought he might be trying to give me a ring of some kind. I was relieved but baffled that it was something else entirely.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too much, James. You don\u2019t need to shower me with gifts. It\u2019s really not my thing.\u201d</p> <p>He touched my ear lightly. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not your thing. It\u2019s my thing, so humor me. And they match your eyes. I knew they would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to the other ones? The ones I wore last night? I hope I didn\u2019t lose them.\u201d</p><p>He just smiled at me. \u201cYou didn\u2019t. I packed them. When will you learn that I\u2019m a man who thinks of everything?\u201d</p><p>I sighed at his description of himself, oddly resentful at the aptness of it.</p><p>He kissed my forehead, grabbing my hand and leading me from the plane.</p> <p>Helene nodded at us as we left, calling out a polite good-day. I nodded back, uncomfortable but civil.</p><p>We emerged into a landscape of rolling green hills, surrounding a tiny landing strip that I doubted anyone could call an airport. It was an instant, pleasant change from Vegas.</p><p>\u201cHow pretty,\u201d I said, as he led me to a sleek silver convertible sports car. Two black SUV\u2019s were parked behind it, and I saw Clark getting behind the wheel of one of them.</p><p>The convertible\u2019s leather seats were a bright blue that contrasted with the gunmetal color of the car. The emblem was a crown, and I had no idea what brand it was, but I knew nothing about cars, so I shouldn\u2019t have been surprised. It was a given that the brand was out of my price range.</p><p>He opened the passenger side for me, handing me in, and even buckling my seat belt. I gave him a wry look as he did so.</p><p>\u201cI could never pass up an opportunity to restrain you,\u201d he said softly, as he ran his hand along the belt.</p> <p>He got into the driver\u2019s seat, reaching into the glove box and taking out two pairs of sunglasses. I took my pair, thanking him.</p><p>\u201cYou thought of everything,\u201d I said, reaffirming his own words from a few minutes ago.</p><p>His right hand, which had been gripping my knee, went to my wrist. The marks there were harsh and red, the skin raw in places.</p><p>\u201cNot everything, apparently. This went too far.\u201d He started the car, signaling the SUV\u2019s. Clark\u2019s car went in front of us, the other falling into place behind.</p><p>Clark sped ahead in a hurry. He had to be speeding as he drove almost out of our sight on the two lane highway. I watched the lovely rolling hills pass us as James handled the sports car, as he did all things, with consummate skill.</p><p>The rolling hills quickly turned into pine covered foothills and plateaus. It was a lovely, pleasant drive. Even the weather was perfect. We had been transported from the desert and into a green haven.</p><p>James kept his hand on my thigh, rubbing and squeezing as he drove, only lifting it to shift when necessary.</p><p>I shifted slightly in my seat, already a little sore from our activities of the night before.</p> <p>James noticed immediately. \u201cYou sore?\u201d he asked me. He had to raise his voice a little to be heard above the sound of the car and the wind.</p><p>I gave a little shrug. \u201cNothing that I mind,\u201d I answered. \u201cCertainly nothing that would make me want to keep from doing it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about a half a dozen times?\u201d he asked me with a warm smile, his eyes hidden behind dark shades.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t keep from responding with my own soft smile.</p><p>Less than twenty-four hours with him, and he already had me wrapped around his little finger again.</p><p>It was hard to stay away from him, even while he was driving. A rather obtrusive console separated us.</p><p>I slid my hand over to his waist, pressing my hand over the bulge in his jeans.</p><p>His hand covered my own and he shot me a rather surprised look.</p><p>I checked the SUVs escorting us. They both seemed safely out of sight for the moment.</p><p>I fumbled with the button on his jeans, finally unbuckling to use both hands. I uncovered his growing erection, and he sucked in a breath as the air hit him. I arranged myself over the console, taking him into my mouth before he could protest. The console dug into my ribs a little painfully, but it wasn\u2019t enough pain to stop me.</p><p>His hand gripped my hair roughly. \u201cFuck.\u201d His curse was low and hoarse. \u201cThat\u2019s not safe, Bianca,\u201d</p><p>he said, but he didn\u2019t stop me.</p><p>I lifted my head briefly to say, \u201cSo come fast, and we\u2019ll be out of danger quickly.\u201d I took him back into my mouth, stroking his base hard with both hands. His grip on my hair grew painful as I bobbed my mouth up and down on his cock relentlessly.</p><p>He was coming in my mouth in under two minutes. I hadn\u2019t even known he was capable of coming so fast. He cursed and moaned as I swallowed his hot cum.</p><p>\u201cFuck, fuck, fuck. Bianca, you\u2019re too much. I almost went off the road. My vision got way too fuzzy there.\u201d</p><p>I sat up, buckling in. I smiled at him, a wicked smile, my lids heavy but hidden.</p><p>He stared, mesmerized. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be the death of me, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>We were on the highway for just over an hour before James began to slow down, seemingly in the middle of nowhere. Clark had turned off of the road in front of us, I saw. James followed him, turning onto a well-paved but small road. We passed through heavy gates almost immediately after turning off of the main road. It was set up so that you couldn\u2019t even use the road to turn your car around without the gate open.</p><p>We were on the small road a good twenty minutes, passing through rolling hills, then a forest of oaks, then between twin plateaus. The grassy hills were dotted with pine trees here. It was a mercurial, changing landscape. Land just like the man who owned it all.</p><p>\u201cAlmost there,\u201d James said, his hand on my knee.</p><p>I saw the sprawled-out buildings minutes before we reached the ranch. It seemed almost unreal, this secluded compound in the middle of nowhere.</p><p>James pulled directly up to the main building. All of the buildings matched, built in an elegant dark brown wood in a modern log cabin style, with huge reflective windows. It looked like an ultra modern take on a cabin in the woods. It mixed the modern with nature, taking elements of the area and adding a stylish flair. It seemed to be the Cavendish designing trademark.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s lovely,\u201d I told him.</p><p>He smiled, pleased. \u201cThe stables are in back, but let me show you the house first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could see them from the road. What are all of the other buildings? The house seems so huge just by itself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor staff,\u201d he said, as he pulled me inside.</p><p>He showed me the house room by room. It was beautiful, of course.</p><p>\u201cYou decorated this,\u201d I stated. I didn\u2019t have to ask. I was starting to recognize his personal touch. The stark modern floors and walls mixed with rustic tables and furnishings that had an authentic Wyoming feel to them just had his stamp all over it.</p><p>He just nodded, leading me through the entryway and through a mammoth living room. He showed me each room of the main floor, pointing out details of the design.</p><p>\u201cWhat? No antlers?\u201d I asked him, as he led me around.</p><p>He gave me a mock glare.</p><p>I realized I needed a nap as he led me up the stairs. I tried to stifle a yawn.</p><p>He glanced back at me. \u201cNap-time,\u201d he told me.</p><p>I just nodded, though it hadn\u2019t been a question.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll finish the tour later,\u201d he said.</p><p>He led me to what was obviously the master bedroom and into a ridiculously huge closet. Half of it held what were obviously women\u2019s clothing. I shot him a look.</p><p>\u201cWhose clothing is that?\u201d I asked. I\u2019d been going for a casual tone, but it came out stiff.</p><p>He gave me a censorious look. \u201cYours. I told you I had my shopper pick out a wardrobe for you. You can add whatever you like, but I thought it would be convenient, for the moment, to have at least the essentials available for you, so you don\u2019t have to pack every time we want to go to one of my houses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said you had done that in New York. And I didn\u2019t imagine it was anything like this. This is too much, James.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d he said curtly, pulling a tiny transparent slip off of a hanger and thrusting it at me. \u201cPut this on and get in bed,\u201d he ordered, and started to strip.</p><p>\u201cDo you always do this? Looking at this closet, you\u2019d think you were living with a woman. Is this your usual...arrangement?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not! I\u2019ve never lived with a woman, never even considered it. You will be the first, when I\u2019ve talked you into it,\u201d he told me, pulling off his shirt.</p><p>\u201cIt will be an easy transition once I convince you,\u201d he continued blandly, \u201csince all of my properties have been stocked with your things. As I said, you can add whatever you like. And if there\u2019s any decorating changes you\u2019d like to make, please feel free to do so. I know I can be controlling and possessive about my things, but I want you to feel that what\u2019s mine is yours.\u201d</p><p>I froze in the act of unbuttoning my pants. The things he was saying, and in that dispassionate tone, just weren\u2019t computing in my head.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be serious,\u201d I said softly.</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiving with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see by the look on your face that you aren\u2019t pleased with the notion, but I\u2019m a very determined man.</p><p>Start getting accustomed to the idea.\u201d</p><p>I went back to undressing, dismissing the notion. Maybe he was trying to say outrageous things just to get me to talk about the things I didn\u2019t want to. I didn\u2019t know. But, instead of feeling caged or trapped by the arrangement he was proposing, I felt...nothing. Denial was my reaction, and I welcomed it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re insane,\u201d I told him lightly as I pulled on the tiny slip he\u2019d handed me.</p><p>I crawled into the luxurious covers of yet another of his ridiculously oversized beds. I felt him hovering near my side, standing over the bed.</p><p>\u201cWell, I suppose that\u2019s not the worst reaction I could have gotten. I was scared you would run screaming from the house, so this is actually a positive, compared to that,\u201d he told me, his voice still so dispassionate. I\u2019d heard him use that tone on the phone before. I realized it was the one that he used for business transactions.</p><p>I heard him go into the bathroom, not shutting the door. The shower began to run. I was asleep before he joined me in bed.</p><p>CHAPTER ELEVEN</p><p>James was a hot weight enfolding me from behind when I awoke. The clock on the bedside table read 1:30 p.m. I\u2019d slept at least four hours, and I desperately needed a shower. I slid out from under his heavy arm, going into the bathroom. I shut the door behind me as quietly as I could. The man seemed to get so little sleep. I\u2019d feel bad if I woke him, when he seemed to be sleeping so deeply. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I was rinsing conditioner from my hair when he pressed his naked body against my back. I gasped.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d he murmured, reaching around me to pump some soap into his hand. His arousal was already hard and pressed against my backside. He rubbed the soap over me with one hand, kneading at my breasts. I was already clean, but I didn\u2019t protest. Who would?</p><p>He was washing himself with his other hand, and I felt it as he reached his own arousal, stroking the length, again and again. He reached between my legs as he did so, his expert fingers giving attention to every fold.</p><p>\u201cPut your hands against the wall,\u201d he rasped into my ear after he\u2019d teased us both for several minutes.</p> <p>I laid my hands flat against the wall, and he grasped my hips roughly. He buried his face in my neck as he drove into me. It was a smooth entry, but he hammered into me, again and again, holding nothing back.</p><p>Every stroke pulled along that perfect spot, and I arched my back, sobbing. One hand held my hips anchored while the other slid up to a wet breast, gripping it roughly. He pinched the nipple, twisting hard enough to make me cry out. He bit my neck at the same moment.</p><p>I came instantly, sobbing out his name brokenly. The name James had never had so many syllables.</p><p>\u201cFucking perfect,\u201d he groaned into my ear. \u201cTell me you\u2019re mine. I need you, Bianca. I need you to know that you belong to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I gasped, already building inexorably towards another powerful climax.</p> <p>\u201cSay it,\u201d he bit out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m yours, James. I belong to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow come,\u201d he ordered, spilling into me with a rough shout.</p><p>The shout did it, and I was lost again in the rolling waves of pleasure.</p><p>He washed me again, leaning my near limp body against him. \u201cNo one else can do this for you, Bianca.</p><p>Don\u2019t ever even consider it. You were made for me.\u201d</p> <p>He dried me and nearly carried me to the bed, laying me down. \u201cI\u2019ll get your clothes. I want to dress you.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t return for several minutes, and when he did the sight of him made me prop myself up on my elbows to study him more thoroughly. He was wearing skin-hugging tan riding breeches, with dark brown chaps that came to his knees. He wore a thin bright white V-neck shirt. The getup hugged nearly every muscle of his body, leaving nothing to the imagination. It was absolutely, mouthwateringly sexy.</p><p>My jaw dropped. He smiled, and it was wicked.</p><p>He set a bulky pile of clothing on the bed beside me, and began the drawn-out process of gearing me up to ride. He dressed my bottom half first, slipping on my tiny panties, caressing every body part that he passed. He had to work the tan riding pants up my legs more slowly, they were so tight.</p><p>\u201cAre they too small?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. This is what they\u2019re supposed to do, until you break them in. They will fit like a glove soon enough.\u201d He worked them to my waist as he spoke. He kissed my belly, running soft fingers over the fading bruises along my torso. He did that so often, it was becoming a sort of ritual.</p><p>He slipped thick soft black socks onto my feet, kissing my arches. Next, he worked on stiff dark brown ankle-length boots that matched his own. \u201cThese will take breaking in as well. The leather\u2019s been softened, so it shouldn\u2019t be too rough,\u201d he explained.</p><p>He worked dark brown leather half-chaps onto my legs next. He named all of the clothing as he dressed me. The chaps hooked just under my heels, fastening to my legs with heavy velcro. It allowed him to size them to my long, thin calves perfectly. \u201cI got you some full chaps as well, but this is the best gear for learning.\u201d</p> <p>He moved to my top half next, managing to slip me into a snug sports bra without making me sit up. It zipped in the front, and he sucked on each breast thoroughly before zipping it up with a look of regret. It was only then that he sat me up, slipping a skin tight white V-neck shirt over my head, pulling each of my arms through gently.</p><p>I laughed at him. \u201cWe match again, you weirdo.\u201d</p><p>He grinned back at me. \u201cI find that I like that. I can\u2019t say that this will be the last time, either.\u201d He pulled me to my feet, straightening my shirt as he did so.</p><p>\u201cYou realize that I can dress myself, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He just smiled, content. \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind my eccentricity, I prefer to do this.\u201d</p><p>I gave him my little shrug. I hadn\u2019t known pampering like this before, and I found myself unexpectedly relishing the experience. \u201cIt makes me feel special. I find that I love it. I find that I love everything you do to me.\u201d</p><p>He cupped my face, his eyes fiercely tender. I had to force myself to meet that searing gaze. \u201cYou are special. You\u2019re the most special person in the world to me. I don\u2019t known how to make you see and feel that.\u201d</p><p>I was speechless. He kept saying the most disarming things to me, things I had never prepared myself to hear.</p><p>My stomach growled loudly, interrupting the too intense moment.</p><p>He kissed my forehead, taking my hand. \u201cLet\u2019s feed you, poor thing. I\u2019ve been negligent.\u201d</p><p>He led me swiftly to the kitchen, where an attractive black-haired woman was busily preparing a meal that smelled divine. She beamed at James but greeted me more cooly, while remaining wholly professional. \u201cI\u2019ve prepared slow cooked three-bean chicken chili, Sir. I could also prepare sandwiches, or anything else that you\u2019d prefer for lunch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll take sandwiches, and fresh vegetables from the garden. We will eat in the formal dinning room for lunch, and have the chili for dinner, Sara,\u201d he said without asking me, leading me into the daunting dinning room.</p><p>\u201cWhy not use the smaller dinning room for just the two of us?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cThis room is more private,\u201d he said with a shrug.</p><p>He pulled me onto his lap for a long kiss. It was a sweet, affectionate kiss, but it left me hot all the same.</p><p>I felt his hands in my hair, and it was a drugging moment before I realized he was braiding it. I pulled back with reluctance. He just moved his mouth to my neck, braiding all the while. He\u2019d barely finished that task before he was spreading sunblock on my arms, keeping me on his lap the entire time. I hadn\u2019t even seen the little bottle on the table, he\u2019d had my attention so completely glued to him.</p><p>He set me onto my own chair only when Sara was carrying a large tray into the room. It held several Turkey sandwiches on dark wheat buns, with some sort of white cheese that I couldn\u2019t have named, and loaded with vegetables. They were delicious, the vegetables tasting fresh from the garden. Each sandwich was smeared with a spicy hummus. She brought out a large dish of fresh, raw vegetables as well, with a serving of hummus for dipping.</p><p>I ate heartily. I\u2019d gone too long between meals. \u201cI\u2019m going to lose some weight hanging out with you. I try to eat healthy normally, but not surprisingly, you take healthy eating to the next level. You don\u2019t even know the meaning of the term \u2018half-assed\u2019.\u201d</p><p>He gave me his censorious look. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to lose weight.\u201d</p><p>I gave a little shrug and went back to eating. Easy for Mr. No Body Fat to say, I thought.</p><p>James finished eating before I did. \u201cDo you mind if I make some calls?\u201d he asked politely.</p><p>I shook my head that I didn\u2019t mind, knowing he was skipping out on a lot of work just to be there.</p><p>I finished eating, and waited for maybe five minutes while he made call after call, working on his laptop as he did so.</p><p>\u201cDo you mind if I go look at the horses while you work?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, waving me off absentmindedly.</p><p>\u201cTake your time,\u201d I told him as I left. I had a general idea where the stables were, so I headed that way.</p><p>I nearly got lost just trying to leave the palatial house, but finally found a door that led out of a room adjacent to the kitchen. I\u2019d walked in a circle just to get there. It was easier to take a direct route to the stables after I got outside, since the buildings housing the horses were so huge that I couldn\u2019t possibly miss them.</p><p>I walked inside the wide opening into the shaded stalls, looking into each one. Many of the stalls were empty. I stopped at the first stall that wasn\u2019t. It held a beautiful chestnut who came when I clicked to it softly. It let me pet it, sniffing around for snacks. I hadn\u2019t thought to bring any, hadn\u2019t known where any were.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll love you if you give her an apple,\u201d a deep, unfamiliar voice drawled behind me, a hint of a strange accent detectable. I thought it may be French, but wasn\u2019t sure. I turned, a little startled, though I shouldn\u2019t have been. Of course there would be people in the stables. The sight that greeted me, though, was startling.</p><p>The man was tall and smiling, his black hair shaved close to his head. He was devastatingly handsome, with a dominant but attractive nose and smiling eyes. His strong jaw had an appealing five o\u2019clock shadow. I guessed he was in his early thirties. He was geared up in clothing similar to my own, and the tight apparel showed his heavy muscles to distraction. His teeth were even, his smile engaging. I met his light brown eyes, smiling politely.</p><p>He sized me up as I had him.</p><p>My breath caught as I saw the riding crop in his hand. It was for the horses, of course, but he looked like a man who could dominate a woman, and my newly awakened sexuality made my mind drift to the things he might do to a woman with that crop.</p><p>He held a hand for me to shake, stepping closer to me to pat the horse on the neck while he did so. I shook his hand, and he gripped mine firmly, lingering. I pulled away hastily.</p><p>\u201cThis one is Nanny. She\u2019s a good horse.\u201d He went to a bag near the door of her stall, pulling out an apple, and handing it to me. \u201cIf you\u2019re looking for a horse that will adore you, look no further than Nanny. She\u2019s as docile as they come. You don\u2019t look like a woman who appreciates docile, though. I\u2019m Pete, by the way. I train horses for Mr. Cavendish. In fact, I do just about anything horse-related for the boss.\u201d</p><p>I smiled at him while I tried to feed Nanny the apple. I pulled back with a startled yip when she tried to take the apple from my hand, fingers and all.</p><p>Pete laughed, stepping in close behind me. \u201cNot like that, ma chere.\u201d He positioned my hand around the apple so that my fingers weren\u2019t sticking out like tempting targets. \u201cNever give a horse your finger, or sure enough, they\u2019ll take it.\u201d He held the apple to her with me, and she took it this time without touching me with her teeth.</p><p>I moved hastily away from Pete after Nanny had the apple.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Bianca,\u201d I said, strangely breathless.</p><p>He winked at me. \u201cI know who you are. The boss\u2019s lady. Come with me. I have a special treat for you.\u201d He turned and walked away, just expecting me to follow him.</p><p>He knows I\u2019m with James, so he should be safe. Shouldn\u2019t he? I wondered.</p><p>I hesitated, then followed.</p><p>CHAPTER TWELVE</p><p>He led me to a large, open corral that held a lovely pale horse that captured my attention immediately.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s what we call a palomino, based on her coloring. The tan coat with the white hair. She\u2019s a palomino thoroughbred, which is rare. Her name is Princess, and the boss wants you to learn to ride on her. She doesn\u2019t have any bad habits, so she won\u2019t be teaching you any. But she\u2019s real particular, so it might be tricky.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I continued to stare at the beautiful creature. She was already saddled and tossing her head restlessly.</p><p>I noticed absently where all of the horses from the stalls had been. The were frolicking and eating in a large pasture just behind Princess\u2019s corral.</p><p>\u201cYou want to get on her, see how she feels?\u201d Pete asked, smiling at me. He had his elbows propped up on the high post of the corral. \u201cMr. Cavendish said you had some injuries, so we can just work on your seat for today. You set the pace. We\u2019ll go however fast you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to teach me to ride?\u201d I asked him, surprised. I had oddly assumed James would be teaching me. This made more sense, I supposed.</p> <p>He shrugged, smiling. \u201cWho else? I train the horses, so why not the people that ride them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, yeah, I\u2019d like to ride her. She\u2019s exquisite.\u201d</p><p>He gave me a wicked grin.</p><p>It made me want to shiver, but not in distaste.</p><p>\u201cLike her rider,\u201d he said, his tone rich with sin. \u201cI can see why the boss wanted to see you on her.</p> <p>Come on, ma chere, let\u2019s get you mounted.\u201d</p><p>I blushed at his terminology, but followed him to the palomino.</p><p>I petted her nose first, and she sniffed me, flipping her lovely white hair.</p><p>\u201cShe seems to like you fine so far,\u201d Pete observed. She had lovely amber eyes. \u201cCome here, ma chere,\u201d</p><p>Pete said, standing at the horse\u2019s side.</p><p>I stepped closer to him, but not too close. He tsk\u2019d at me. \u201cI won\u2019t bite. Come here. I\u2019ll help you on her back.\u201d</p> <p>I stepped even closer, until I felt like I was way too close. He turned me by the shoulders, his touch gentle but dominant. I sucked in a breath.</p><p>He grabbed my hips and lifted me suddenly.</p><p>\u201cLeft foot in the stirrup, right over the horse,\u201d he said, not even breathless from the impressive lift. I did what he said, and Princess shifted restlessly when I sat in the saddle. \u201cNow, your seat is the most important part. If you have that down correctly, it\u2019ll make everything else work right. You actually look natural on that horse, Bianca.\u201d As he spoke, he gripped my thigh, pushing it against the horse firmly.</p><p>His grip moved down to my foot, pushing my toe in slightly, and my heel down. \u201cHeels down, toes in.</p><p>And remember to grip her real, real tight with your thighs. She has a sensitive mouth, which is good.</p><p>That\u2019s what I meant about her not having bad habits. But it means you\u2019re gonna be real light with the reigns. Real light. Most of your control will be gained from the movement of your legs.\u201d</p><p>I followed his instructions carefully, mindful of every part of my body, not wanting to mess up.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he said approvingly. \u201cYour legs look amazing. Mr. Cavendish said you hadn\u2019t ridden before, so you must be a real natural to look so good, so fast. It doesn\u2019t hurt that you have killer legs.\u201d He gave me an appreciative smile at his last comment, and I blushed involuntarily.</p> <p>The man was flustering me, for some odd reason. He moved to my other side, making a pleased sound in his throat. The sound made me blush harder.</p><p>\u201cLook at you,\u201d he murmured. \u201cI didn\u2019t even have to touch this leg, and you fixed it perfectly.\u201d</p><p>He brought out the riding crop he\u2019d tucked into his chap, and brushed it lightly along my back. My eyes flew to his in shock, trying to read his intent.</p><p>\u201cArch your back, ma chere,\u201d he instructed. I complied automatically, the motion seating me more securely in the saddle. \u201cPerfect. Your seat is looking great,\u201d he said, still not removing the crop from my back. \u201cYou think you feel up to walking her a bit?\u201d</p><p>I was nodding as I caught a movement out of the corner of my eye. I looked up to see James striding towards us out of the stable, looking positively livid.</p><p>Pete spotted him at the same time I did. He gave his boss an inquiring look.</p><p>James didn\u2019t speak until he was intimidatingly close to the other man. James was maybe an inch taller than Pete, but he made that inch work to his advantage, glaring down at the other man.</p><p>\u201cGive me that crop, Pete,\u201d James said through gritted teeth.</p><p>Pete obeyed, looking startled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be training Bianca. And don\u2019t ever lay another finger on her. Or anything else, for that matter. Do you understand?\u201d James asked, his voice filled with rage. His hands were clenched, one around the offending crop.</p><p>Pete nodded, his mouth curving down in a frown.</p><p>\u201cLeave us, Pete,\u201d James ordered coldly.</p><p>Pete left instantly, without saying one word, though he adopted a leisurely pace.</p><p>James turned his livid eyes to me. He looked furious, but I saw the hurt there, too. I didn\u2019t understand it, didn\u2019t understand him.</p><p>He gripped my thigh with his free hand, his head dropping forward suddenly, and he laid his cheek on my thigh, putting his hand on my horse\u2019s neck. I stroked my hand over his hair, and he shuddered under my touch.</p><p>I should be mad at him, I thought, for embarrassing me, for embarrassing his trainer, but I just wasn\u2019t.</p><p>He seemed almost injured by the exchange. While I didn\u2019t understand it, I wasn\u2019t immune to his pain.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t stand seeing that,\u201d he told me finally, his voice harsh and raw. \u201cWhen I see another man touch you, I want to kill him. Why were you letting him touch you, Bianca? Do you want him?\u201d</p><p>I stroked his hair. \u201cI thought he was supposed to teach me to ride. You overreacted, James. He was just showing me how to sit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw your face. You were reacting to him. Don\u2019t lie to me. I know that look. And he wanted you. I saw his face, as well.\u201d</p><p>I froze. I had been reacting to him, in a way, though I hadn\u2019t been about to do anything about it. It had been the simple reaction of a woman meeting a man whom she sensed could please her, a man who wanted to. I had simply felt an attraction, when I was seldom attracted. But it was nothing to compare to my reaction to just the sight of James, just the thought of him.</p><p>I licked my lips. \u201cI-it was nothing. I was startled by the crop. I think you know why. I couldn\u2019t believe he had used it in that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was dominating you, and you were submitting to him. I know what I saw.\u201d</p><p>I continued to stroke his hair when he fell silent, searching for the right words. \u201cIf that was what was happening, it wasn\u2019t deliberate, and I didn\u2019t understand it. Even if he had made a pass at me, which he didn\u2019t, I would have turned him down.\u201d</p><p>He was shaking his head before I finished. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough, Bianca. It\u2019s not just about the sex. It\u2019s about the ownership. I want you to promise me that you won\u2019t let another man touch you. And if they do, you need to pull away immediately. Even if it\u2019s just here.\u201d He reached up, touching my elbow, his eyes angry and charged.</p><p>My brows drew together in a frown. \u201cStephan-\u201c \u201cI\u2019m not talking about Stephan. Stephan is the exception, of course.\u201d</p><p>I sighed at him, wanting to get down from the horse. \u201cYou\u2019re asking too much, James. Flight attendants hug every time they see each other. I\u2019m already odd enough, without finding new things to separate me from everyone else. And most of the men I touch are gay, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. I\u2019m not talking about them. I\u2019m talking about you thinking about how I would react to seeing who was touching you, and to react accordingly. If you think it would bother me, don\u2019t do it. How about that?\u201d</p><p>I glared. \u201cAnd what about you? What arbitrary rules do I get to impose on you?\u201d</p><p>He straightened, holding his hands out as if in deference. \u201cName them. I\u2019ll be happy to oblige any whim that makes you happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. No one is allowed to touch you, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s an easy one. Done.\u201d He closed his eyes, leaning his face into my leg again. \u201cThe sight of him touching you with that crop made me insane. I can\u2019t get that picture out of my head. I want to rip him apart, the kinky bastard.\u201d</p><p>I nearly laughed. James should talk... but I didn\u2019t think pointing that out would help.</p><p>I stroked his hair, trying to comfort him. His hair was soft and silky, and so thick, especially for such a light color. I stroked it away from his golden kissed skin.</p><p>We stayed like that for several minutes, neither of us saying a word. Princess shifted impatiently but was otherwise cooperative. James began to stroke her neck, making soothing noises, not taking his cheek off of my thigh.</p><p>Eventually he straightened, adjusting my hands on the reigns, then studying my \u2018seat\u2019 in the saddle. He poked the spot between my shoulder blades with one finger. \u201cShoulders back,\u201d he instructed.</p><p>\u201cPerfect,\u201d he said when I complied.</p><p>\u201cGoddammit,\u201d he said suddenly. \u201cHe put you on her without a helmet?\u201d He lifted his arms up to me, almost in the stance of coaxing a child into his arms.</p><p>I leaned down to him, and he pulled me off of the horse like a rag doll.</p><p>He laughed, the moody bastard. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to work on your dismount. Come. Let\u2019s get you a helmet.\u201d</p><p>We found several, in what he called a tack room. James went immediately to a black one on the wall, fitting it onto my head.</p><p>\u201cFeel good?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I nodded. He pulled me back out to Princess, who was trotting in circles around the corral. He made a clicking noise at her, and she came to him. She held perfectly still when she was near us, as though waiting for me to mount her.</p><p>James glanced around, his brows knitting together. \u201cWhere\u2019s the mounting block?\u201d he asked, looking at me.</p><p>I shrugged, wondering why he thought I should know.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you mount her?\u201d</p><p>I grimaced, seeing where this was going.</p><p>\u201cRight here,\u201d I said, resigned for another of his outbursts.</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPete lifted me onto her back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother. Fucker,\u201d he said through clenched teeth. But that was all.</p><p>He lifted me much like Pete had, but I knew what to do with my legs at that point, so he didn\u2019t have to instruct me. I adjusted myself into my seat as they had told me. Back arched, shoulders back, toes in, heels down, thighs tensed. I kept my reigns steady but put no pressure on the horse\u2019s mouth.</p><p>\u201cBeautiful seat. You\u2019re a natural. You\u2019re going to pick this up in no time. You feel up to walking her around a bit?\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>\u201cYou want me to lead you, or do you want to try controlling her? You\u2019re going to need to be very light on her reigns. Shift in your saddle to show her where you want her to go. It\u2019s all about the legwork, with the really good thoroughbreds. If you use her reigns too roughly she\u2019s liable to buck, understand?\u201d</p><p>The mention of bucking intimidated me, but I nodded, willing to at least try.</p><p>James unsnapped her lead rope and stepped back. He looked a little worried. It wasn\u2019t reassuring.</p><p>\u201cOk, now walk her around the corral. Hug the edges.\u201d</p><p>I did, afraid to tug at the reigns even a little, sitting forward and leaning how I wanted her to go while gripping with my thighs. She obeyed beautifully, her walk smooth and quick. There was no pain at all in my ribs as she moved, her gait was so smooth. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPerfect, Love. Are your injuries smarting at all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a bit. She has such a smooth walk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. She\u2019s my best mare. A real prize. Do you feel up to trying to trot?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, already wanting to move faster.</p> <p>\u201cWalk her to me.\u201d</p><p>I did, and she obeyed perfectly. James patted her coat, then rubbed his hand up my leg, smiling. \u201cWe\u2019re going to start with posting. This is where you will lift from the horse for one beat, then sit on the next, as she trots. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. I had not a clue.</p><p>He put a hand on my butt, the other on my hip. He pushed lightly, and I stood slightly in the stirrups at his touch.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll move with her movement, up and down like this.\u201d</p> <p>He pushed me back down.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s rather like being on top when you have sex,\u201d he said with a grin. \u201cJust pretend you\u2019re making love to the saddle.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTEEN</p><p>I blinked at him, wondering if he was being perverted and funny, or perverted and serious.</p><p>He grinned wickedly. \u201cThat\u2019s right. You wouldn\u2019t know about being on top. I\u2019ll have to let you ride me later, then I can really demonstrate what I\u2019m trying to explain. In the meantime, move all the way forward in the saddle, and keep your feet deep in the stirrups, okay?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, obeying carefully.</p> <p>I yelped in surprise as he vaulted up behind me. Princess shied a little, taking several steps back, but he had her stilling as he commanded her to in a soothing tone. He pressed in close behind me, and I felt his obvious arousal.</p><p>I shot him an arch look over my shoulder. \u201cAre you always hard?\u201d</p><p>He gave a little shrug. \u201cI can\u2019t watch you straddle something and grind yourself against it and not get turned on. So sue me.\u201d He gripped my hips tight, grinding against me from behind.</p><p>I glanced down at our legs. His dangled behind mine with no stirrups. He somehow made the precarious position look natural.</p><p>He slapped my ass lightly. \u201cPay attention,\u201d he commanded. \u201cLook forward and correct your seat.\u201d</p><p>I wriggled, trying to obey. It was challenging with an aroused James grinding into me. \u201cYou\u2019re in the way. Or rather, your cock is.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, rubbing against me. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to manage to ignore it. I\u2019m up here to show you the rhythm. Like this.\u201d He lifted my hips, then lowered them, clicking the horse into the trot. I supposed it was a lot like being on top. Princess trotted up and down, up and down, and James moved me with her momentum.</p><p>He was, of coarse, using the demonstration to his advantage, grinding against me every time I touched back down on the saddle. \u201cYou could go even higher, and it would still be a good trot. Try it.\u201d</p> <p>I did, and the exaggerated motion felt even more natural to me.</p><p>\u201cOkay, now sit deep in the saddle and lean back a bit. We\u2019re going to try a sitting trot next. You\u2019ll keep in the saddle and just move with her. It\u2019s a lot like learning to canter, so you\u2019ll be prepared when I start teaching you that.\u201d</p><p>I did as he instructed, and found the sitting trot a little more challenging. James leaned his chest against my back, hands on my hips. \u201cJust move with her. Accept her rhythm and relax. Yes, perfect, Love.\u201d</p><p>He leaned in, whispering roughly in my ear. \u201cI\u2019m going to fuck you on horseback soon. You\u2019re going to straddle me while I ride, and we can fuck to this rhythm. It\u2019s gonna be so hard and rough that you\u2019ll be sore when we\u2019re done. Would you like that?\u201d</p><p>My mind went a little hazy and soft at his visual. \u201cYes. Can we do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. But not on Princess. We\u2019ll take my stallion, Devil. He\u2019s a huge beast of a horse, more than up to the task.\u201d</p><p>His hand moved to my breast as he spoke, cupping it softly, his fingers finding my nipple as it hardened in response.</p><p>It was hard for me to focus after that, and James didn\u2019t help, caressing me every time he corrected me.</p><p>He called a halt to the lesson some time later. I was aching and needy by then, the last half of the lesson a blur of sensual teasing.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a tease,\u201d I told him, my tone breathless.</p><p>He hopped off the back of my horse in a smooth motion. He met my gaze with raised brows. \u201cThat\u2019s a silly thing to say, when I\u2019m about to make you come over and over again. Let\u2019s work on your dismount.</p><p>Swing your other leg over.\u201d</p><p>I did, standing on just one side of the horse.</p><p>He grabbed me, pulling me down the rest of the way. \u201cShe\u2019s too tall. You\u2019ll need a mounting block if I\u2019m not here to lift you. My horses are particularly tall breeds, for the most part. With those long legs of yours, though, you\u2019d be able to mount almost any other kind of horse from the ground.\u201d He spoke into my ear after he\u2019d lowered me, pressing into my back. He made the words sound dirty, even though they weren\u2019t. The man could make anything sound dirty.</p><p>He caressed my breasts from behind, kissing and sucking on my neck. \u201dWe\u2019re going to fuck like animals in the horse stalls, and you\u2019re going to love it.\u201d</p><p>I gasped. \u201cAren\u2019t there people around? Working?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dismissed them all before I found you. I plan to make love to you in as many areas of this ranch as we can in one trip.\u201d</p><p>I licked my lips. He\u2019d never used the term make love before. I found it peculiar that he would do so now. \u201cMake love? Isn\u2019t what we do called fucking?\u201d I asked him.</p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t it be both?\u201d James growled against me.</p><p>I didn\u2019t have an answer for that. Instead, I thought of another question. The question embarrassed me, but I asked it anyways. My curiosity always seemed to win out on my pride where James was concerned. \u201cHow many women have you brought to this ranch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust you, Bianca. I usually come here to get some peace. The only properties I\u2019ve ever brought women to were my New York and Vegas homes. Do you want me to buy new beds and such at those homes?</p><p>Would that make you feel more comfortable?\u201d</p><p>I thought he might be crazy, not for the first time. \u201cAre you offering to get rid of anything in your homes that you might have used to fuck other women?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI assume everything\u2019s been cleaned thoroughly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then that would be wasteful, and silly. Those beds have to be ungodly expensive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think the fact that you didn\u2019t answer is an answer in itself,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>I elbowed him softly. \u201cYour beds look like works of art. I wouldn\u2019t want you to get rid of them. I like them. How often do you get new beds just to humor a girl?\u201d</p><p>He bit me hard enough to make me yelp. \u201cThere you go, belittling us again. You must know by now that I\u2019ve never done any of this for anyone else. I was a slut once with my body, but I\u2019ve never been a slut with my heart.\u201d</p><p>He swung me into his arms suddenly, cradling me. \u201cHow are your injuries?\u201d</p><p>I was surprised to realize that I had forgotten about them completely. \u201cGood. Great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. We\u2019ll go take one of the trails tomorrow, with Princess and Devil.\u201d As he spoke, he carried me into an empty stall. I realized that he\u2019d been serious about where we were going to fuck. I shouldn\u2019t have been surprised. He seemed to be a man of his word. Even when he said something I thought was a complete joke, he\u2019d always followed through, so far. I tried not to linger on that thought, since he\u2019d said some pretty outrageous things in just the last day.</p><p>He set me down. \u201cTake off your helmet. And your pants,.\u201d he ordered, leaving the stall.</p><p>I obeyed, feeling very odd undressing in a horse stall.</p><p>He returned with a huge blanket, laying it on a thick pile of hay. I was just getting to my actual pants, having to first remove my chaps and boots. He lounged on his back on the blanket, peeling off his shirt.</p><p>He left his pants on, just pulling his breeches down to expose his hard length.</p><p>\u201cCome ride me,\u201d he ordered, his tone casual. \u201cI want to see what you learned today.\u201d</p><p>I approached his lounging figure, placing my feet on either side of his hips and lowering myself to my knees. I felt almost more exposed than I did when I was completely naked, with just my bottom half bare.</p><p>\u201cSit on my cock. I want to feel you. Now,\u201d he said roughly when I hesitated.</p><p>I complied, lowering myself slowly, guiding him to my entrance with my hand. I impaled myself, inch by thick inch, shuddering as I did so. All of his teasing caresses had left me more than wet enough to accommodate his entrance.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he said, when I\u2019d seated myself to the hilt. \u201cNow fix your seat and post.\u201d</p><p>I thought he might be joking. I just couldn\u2019t tell, but I did it nevertheless. I positioned my knees for best leverage, put my shoulders back, arched my back, and began to post. I moved up and forward, then down and back in big motions. I moved until only his tip was inside of me, then pushed back down in a jerky motion.</p><p>I rode him for long minutes, working myself more slowly towards my climax than James usually did.</p><p>My hands stroked over his magnificent chest covetously as I rode. It felt so good, unbelievably good, but when he was in control, it just did something for me that nothing else could. I watched him as I posted.</p><p>He had his hands folded behind his head in a casual pose, his lids heavy, watching me. I thought that this position must not quite be his preferred method, either.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re bored,\u201d I accused him, still moving, my voice a gasp.</p><p>He grinned, a wicked grin. I clenched around him just looking at it.</p><p>\u201cNever. I would love to do this all day. It just so happens that I also could. It\u2019s a lot easier for me to keep from coming when you\u2019re in control. I\u2019m sure I don\u2019t have to explain why to you.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t. What his control did for me, it did for him as well. In bed, we couldn\u2019t have been more perfect for each other.</p><p>\u201cYour post is extraordinary, Love. Especially considering your inexperience. Now for the sitting trot,\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeat yourself to the hilt,\u201d he instructed.</p><p>I did it on a gasp.</p><p>\u201cNow just enjoy the ride.\u201d He smiled, and took over the movement, bucking me up and down, his hands gripping my thighs. I caught his rhythm, but that was all. He was on the bottom, but he had suddenly taken all of the control. It was all that I needed.</p><p>I climaxed within seconds, crying out loudly enough to disturb any horses left in the stables. I started to go limp.</p><p>James slapped my ass, hard. \u201cKeep your seat. I\u2019m not done with you.\u201d</p><p>And he wasn\u2019t. He worked me from below for long minutes, grabbing my hips and thrusting up, again and again. He was so tireless. Like a machine, I thought, as he bucked high, bouncing me with the force.</p><p>My head fell back, my hands clutching his on my hips. I couldn\u2019t reach anything else at that point in the wild ride. He reached up to pinch a nipple hard enough to bring tears to my eyes. My gaze went to his.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look away. I need to see your eyes as you fall to pieces.\u201d His voice was a harsh growl, his breathing heavy. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCome, now,\u201d he ordered finally, and it was my undoing, as always.</p><p>I fell apart, and he came with me, his eyes going to that forbidden place of tenderness that I craved, and feared, and tried so hard not to feel down to my soul.</p><p>\u201cOh, Bianca,\u201d he whispered, cupping my cheek as I lowered myself to lay on his chest.</p><p>He shifted me so that he stayed inside of me securely. \u201cYou\u2019re a marvel. I never imagined anyone could be so perfectly made for me.\u201d</p> <p>I shut my eyes, and felt a dreaded tear seep down my cheek. I felt his words deeply, but couldn\u2019t find any of my own, so stayed silent.</p><p>CHAPTER FOURTEEN</p><p>Recovering and getting dressed again was a slow and languorous affair.</p><p>James did most of the work, laying me down to get my pants back on.</p><p>\u201cI want to tie you to that hook and take you there, but your wrists need to heal from the last time,\u201d he murmured as he fastened a chap back on.</p> <p>I looked up at the hook he was talking about. A bridle hung from it. It did seem ideal for his purposes.</p><p>I glanced at my wrists. They were red with conspicuous abrasions. I hadn\u2019t been able to put my watch back on. James had packed it somewhere, I knew. I would have to find a way to cover the marks at work. They could raise questions. They stood out starkly against my pale skin.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind,\u201d I said softly. \u201cI can barely feel them. You could try it. If it got too rough, that\u2019s what my safe word is for, right?\u201d</p><p>He gave me a wild kind of look. I was already able to read him so well. This look said \u2018You shouldn\u2019t encourage me.\u2019</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a dangerous woman,\u201d he nearly growled. \u201cI\u2019ll be making all of the calls about your safety, since you apparently can\u2019t be trusted to judge such things. Your wrists are in bad shape. I went too far the last time, whether you think they hurt now or not. We\u2019ll leave them alone until they\u2019ve healed.\u201d He finished the long process of dressing the lower half of my body as he spoke.</p><p>All he\u2019d had to do was raise his pants and cover himself, then shrug back into his shirt with a fluid movement. I\u2019d watched each delectable part of his body disappear behind clothes with disappointment. I could have looked at his tan flesh forever.</p> <p>He smiled, pulling me against him for a long kiss. We walked back to the house with his arm around my shoulder, tucked tightly into his side.</p><p>A man in a suit and shades whom I didn\u2019t recognize met us at the back door of the house. He nodded at us, opening the door. \u201cSir. Ms. Karlsson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell Pete to tend to the horses,\u201d James said brusquely. \u201cWe are done with the stables for today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Sir. Kent called to check in with you about the investigation,\u201d the man said hesitantly, glancing between the two of us. As though not sure whether to speak in front of me, I thought.</p><p>\u201cAny new developments?\u201d James asked, his voice cold. This was a subject that didn\u2019t improve his mood, I noted.</p><p>\u201cNothing, Sir. Just his daily account of what he and his men have been doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell him to send me a report. And notify me if there are any new leads. That will be all, Paterson.\u201d</p><p>James led me into the house, and Paterson closed the door behind us, remaining outside.</p> <p>\u201cIs that about my father?\u201d I asked him quietly.</p><p>He glanced at me, his face a careful mask. \u201cYes. Can we talk about it yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. There\u2019s nothing to talk about. I gave my report to the police, and I won\u2019t be so careless again. It was just terrible timing that got him into my house in the first place.\u201d</p><p>He blanched. \u201cWill you please tell me what happened? I\u2019m trying to be patient, Bianca, but I need to know how he got to you. If only to prevent it from happening again.\u201d</p><p>I sighed, the pain in his gorgeous eyes affecting me. \u201cStephan was due at my house. I heard the doorbell ring. I checked the peephole, but a hand was covering it. I was a fool. I actually let him in myself. I thought Stephan was playing a mean joke. Which is so ludicrous, because Stephan doesn\u2019t do things like that, even when he\u2019s being playful. I undid my security and opened the door, meaning to tell him off. My father had me pinned to the wall before I could even register who it was.\u201d</p><p>He looked away, his face gone ashen. \u201cHe just attacked you on sight?\u201d</p><p>His hands had dropped away. He looked so forlorn that I wanted to comfort him. But I gave him his space. And, finally, with a resigned sigh, some answers. \u201cHe had seen me in the tabloids. And he thought someone had been investigating him, so he blamed me. He had come to threaten me. The injuries were just his neanderthal way of telling me not to speak to the police.\u201d</p><p>His eyes shot back to mine, shocked and appalled. \u201cIt was my fault. It was my fault you were in the tabloids. And my men had begun to look for him. He laid hands on you because I was careless enough to look for him, and expose you, without protecting you.\u201d</p><p>I studied him. His tone and his face spoke of a deep self-loathing so misplaced that I didn\u2019t even know how to address it.</p><p>\u201cOf course it wasn\u2019t. It was no one\u2019s fault but my own. I know what he\u2019s capable of, more than anyone, and I was careless enough to let him into my home. It\u2019s not your job to protect me, James. It\u2019s my job.</p><p>Stephan had your same reaction, blaming himself. I don\u2019t understand it. It\u2019s impossible to take responsibility for things that are completely out of your control.\u201d</p><p>His eyes were anguished as he told me, \u201cIt is my job to protect you. You don\u2019t have to acknowledge it, but it is. All of my influence is completely worthless if I can\u2019t even protect the thing I cherish most.\u201d</p><p>I reached up and patted his arm comfortingly. \u201cMy dad has been like this for my entire life. Will you blame yourself for all of the other times, as well? You must see how illogical that is.\u201d</p><p>He seemed to get himself under control, schooling his features once again. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to agree on this, Bianca. But thank you for answering some of my questions.\u201d</p><p>I thought briefly of all of the questions I hadn\u2019t answered. And all of the secrets I still kept. I was grateful that James seemed to drop the subject after that.</p><p>\u201cLet me show you the upstairs now. I\u2019ve made some changes that I think will please you,\u201d he told me solemnly.</p><p>I smiled at him. \u201cI\u2019d love to see all of it. Your homes are like works of art. You have impeccable taste.\u201d</p><p>He put his hand on my nape as he led me to a set of stairs. \u201cI have to agree,\u201d he said warmly, and I knew he was referring to more than his homes.</p><p>He pointed out several guest rooms first, just glancing inside. They were themed in different colors. I thought it was a rather English thing to do. They all had names. The Green Room, The Blue Room, etc.</p><p>\u201cAll of your homes probably have the same thing. It\u2019s so English,\u201d I told him teasingly.</p><p>He smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re right. They do.\u201d We came to a closed door that he opened with a flourish. \u201cThe library,\u201d he told me with a smile. \u201cI\u2019ve made some recent additions. Guess which ones.\u201d</p><p>I blinked at the massive room. It was filled with sunlight. It was a a room of windows and books. So many books filled the massive room.</p><p>\u201cI know e-books are the way of the future, but I can\u2019t help it, I still love plain old books. Guess which section I made just for you.\u201d</p><p>I glanced around, baffled as to how he thought I could know that, with so many things to take in. But my eyes fell on it quickly. One of the dark floor to ceiling bookshelves was filled with content that was just more colorful than the rest of it.</p><p>I laughed, delighted and a little embarrassed. \u201cYou know, I don\u2019t just read Manga,\u201d I told him. But I moved to the shelf to study it. It held full collections of all of the favorites that I\u2019d told him about, and several that I had heard of but hadn\u2019t yet read. I sent him a warm smile. \u201cThank you. What a sweet thing to do.\u201d</p><p>He smiled back. \u201cI can be sweet. You inspire me to be sweet. And you can get whatever you want, for any of our libraries. I added a Romance and Urban Fantasy shelf, as well, though I was just guessing at the authors you might like. You only mentioned that your read the genres, not what in particular.\u201d He pointed. \u201cIt\u2019s over by the window.\u201d</p><p>I glanced over, blinking at the extent of what he\u2019d done just to please me. There was a small fortune worth of books in this monstrosity of a room, purchased just for me. It was such a thoughtful thing to do.</p><p>He\u2019d made a few more chips in the thick wall of ice around my heart with the gesture. Little by little, he was making his way in.</p><p>I took deep breaths, trying to manage my sudden feeling of panic at the thought. It worked. I was becoming more accustomed to the way I felt about him. I wasn\u2019t sure if it was a good thing, but I didn\u2019t linger on that thought.</p><p>\u201cThank you. I could spend the afternoon reading, if you need to do some work,\u201d I told him politely.</p><p>\u201cI have one more surprise for you.\u201d He pulled me from the room as he spoke.</p><p>I looked at him warily, wondering what he had planned for me next.</p><p>He led me into a large room with a bed, though I didn\u2019t think it was a bedroom. It was another room of windows, the sunlight streaming in to light every corner. I saw the painting supplies then, lined up along an ornate chestnut table. There was an impressive easel beside it, already holding a large piece of mounted watercolor paper.</p><p>I walked to it, speechless.</p><p>\u201cThe table holds more supplies, in drawers, and shelves. And I had shelving put in along the walls to hold various canvases, so you can keep them organized.\u201d</p><p>I glanced where he gestured with his arm. One wall was covered with custom made, built-in shelving, with shelves large enough to hold many sizes of canvases and papers. Many blank ones were already stacked there, sorted by size. The room was a painter\u2019s dream. It was an inspiration in itself, the large windows giving me an unobstructed view of the majestic Wyoming forest.</p><p>There was a large desk in one corner. It held a Mac that had the biggest screen I\u2019d ever seen on a computer.</p><p>I pointed at it. \u201cWhat\u2019s that thing?\u201d</p><p>He raised his brows, as though I should know. \u201cThose are the best computers for artists. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll find a use for it if you need to pull up a picture, or do any kind of research. There are also several programs you might find useful. I\u2019ll walk you through them, whenever you like.\u201d</p><p>I just nodded, overwhelmed. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cSo what do you want to do this afternoon? I got to pick horseback riding, and you were more than a good sport about it. Your turn. We could read in the library, or you could paint. Or anything, really. What\u2019ll it be?\u201d</p><p>I chewed on my lip, my mind already on a picture I\u2019d seen online that I wanted to paint. \u201cThere is a painting I\u2019d like to start on, if you don\u2019t mind. You could get some work done.\u201d</p><p>He just nodded. \u201cOkay. We need to shower first, though. I\u2019ll work in here with you, if it won\u2019t disturb you.\u201d He gave me an inquiring look while he spoke.</p><p>I just shook my head that it wouldn\u2019t. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThen come.\u201d He led me by the hand back to his bathroom.</p><p>The shower was a short, if intense, affair. James washed every inch of me, but that was all. I tried to return the favor, but he just kissed me, washing himself. He slapped my ass when I was clean.</p><p>\u201cOut,\u201d he ordered.</p><p>I was dressed before he was dry.</p> <p>\u201cI need to grab a few things, if you want to go back to your art studio,\u201d he told me.</p><p>I left the sight of all of his naked flesh with more than a little reluctance.</p><p>I went to the computer, sitting down. I hated to have to look at tabloids, but unfortunately they held what I needed for the painting I was planning. It took me a minute to find out how to even go online with the new operating system. I typed in the name James Cavendish with a little feeling of dread.</p><p>Looking at tabloids had not been a good idea for me lately, but I really wanted that picture.</p><p>CHAPTER FIFTEEN</p> <p>I braced myself for the onslaught of unflattering pictures and headlines I was about to see of myself. I wasn\u2019t disappointed.</p><p>A few phrases stood out. \u2018Cavendish\u2019s new Vegas Vixen\u2019 and \u2019Trashy Man-eater\u2019 caught my eye as I tried to get quickly to images.</p><p>The images didn\u2019t hold the picture I wanted, and I sighed with resignation. I would have to delve deeper into the search.</p><p>I paused on a picture of James, dated just last week. He was alone, in a suit, looking so much more solemn than any of his other red carpet shots.</p><p>I clicked on the picture. It had been taken at a charity event in New York last week. He had none of his usual charm for the camera, instead posing almost coldly. His eyes were impatient, when he usually had a camera-ready smile. I wondered if I had been the cause for his change. If so, the tabloids had probably been running wild with the idea. They hated me, and loved the idea of a love match between James and his best friend\u2019s sister, Jules. I tried to just ignore the many old images of James and Jules as I went back to my original search, scanning carefully for what I wanted.</p><p>I froze at one particular headline. \u2018James Cavendish\u2019s New Love has Countless Other Men on the Side.\u2019 I clicked on the link before I could think better of it, wanting to see what on earth they could mean. I blinked stupidly at the pictures in the article.</p> <p>One was of Stephan and I, walking hand in hand on a sidewalk. I recognized that I was in Miami without having to read the article, though I read the horrid thing anyway.</p><p>According to the article, Stephan was my long-time boyfriend, and we were scheming to get a piece of the Cavendish fortune.</p><p>I scrolled down in disgust, scanning for other pictures. There were several beach shots of Damien and I, and I flushed at some of them. In one, we lounged by the pool. Damien was giving me a very warm look while I lay with my eyes covered by shades, a little smile on my face. It didn\u2019t look anywhere near as innocent as it had actually been. Looking the picture, you got the impression that he was staring at my breasts and thinking naughty things about me.</p><p>Another was of our walk on the beach. His hand was on my elbow, his eyes tender. The way his face was angled towards me... He looked very nearly loving. I was blushing, as though flustered by him, I thought. According to the article beside it, he was a steamy lover that I\u2019d been stringing along. I flushed with anger at the blatant lies.</p><p>They\u2019d even caught a picture of Murphy and I. We were walking beside each other and laughing. The article claimed here that I was a shameless seductress who had too many men ensnared to keep track. I regretted reading the trash before I\u2019d even finished, but finish I did.</p><p>I scrolled back up to the shots of Damien and I. They looked so much different than what had actually been going on, and I wondered why. The look on his face, perhaps? Or the dark shades I wore, that made my expression so inscrutable?</p><p>I was still staring at the disconcerting pictures when James returned to the room quietly, approaching my desk with his slim laptop in one hand.</p><p>He raised a brow when he saw my expression. \u201cWhy do you look like a deer caught in headlights, Bianca?\u201d he asked, his voice amused. He glanced at my computer screen as he got closer. I didn\u2019t close the window, thinking that hiding what I was looking at would be worse than just confronting it.</p> <p>James\u2019s face tensed instantly when he saw the photos of Damien and I. I was struck with a thought. He had seen these before. He wasn\u2019t surprised by the outrageous photos, merely infuriated by them. The conversation we\u2019d had about him hating the beach suddenly made a lot more sense. And his elevated hostility towards Damien.</p><p>\u201cTh-this is all garbage,\u201d I told him, feeling strangely defensive. \u201cDamien and I were just hanging out.</p><p>You know that, right?\u201d</p><p>He studied me, his face painfully solemn. His entire demeanor had changed since he\u2019d glanced at the pictures.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he answered finally. \u201cI know as well as anyone how they can take a made up story and run with it. But it still hurts to see you together like that. Damien obviously cares for you, and wants you.</p><p>Personally, I think he\u2019s in love with you. My only comfort is that if you wanted him, you would have accepted him before you ever met me.\u201d He studied my face, his very serious, before he continued, \u201cAnd I confess, the thought that you\u2019ll choose him if you ever decide to go vanilla has disturbed me.\u201d</p><p>I blinked at his outrageous little rant. \u201cOf course he\u2019s not in love with me. You know we\u2019ve never even been on a date. And I\u2019m not even quite sure just what going vanilla means, but I don\u2019t think of Damien as anything but a friend, even without you in the equation.\u201d</p><p>I wondered, not for the first time, what on earth James could be insecure about. But even the thought was wrong. I just couldn\u2019t put James and insecurity together, even with the proof of it in front of me. The whole idea was absurd. No one in the world could compete with him, in any way. There\u2019s no room in perfection for insecurity, I thought.</p><p>He sat down in the other seat at the large desk. He was a good four feet away there, still. He opened his paper-thin laptop, going to work without another word.</p><p>\u201cAre you upset?\u201d I asked him quietly, needing to clear the air before I could move on.</p><p>His mouth tightened, his fingers already working on his laptop. \u201cI am managing both my unreasonable hurt and my unfounded jealousy. I\u2019ll work it out.\u201d</p><p>I stared at him for awhile, trying to determine how best to proceed. I finally decided that if I wanted to work something out myself, something that nothing could be done about, I would want to be left alone to do so. So that\u2019s what I did.</p><p>I returned to my search, moving on from the inflammatory article, wanting to forget that the horrid thing even existed. I tried to ignore all of the headlines that drew my unwilling attention, and all of the photos that piqued my curiosity.</p><p>I went through webpage after webpage before I finally found what I was looking for. I made a little humph of relief that I\u2019d located the prize.</p><p>My noise got James\u2019s instant attention. I clicked to print out the picture as he rose, looking over my shoulder from behind.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that for?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I turned to smile at him. \u201cI\u2019ve wanted to paint it from the moment I saw it, a few weeks ago,\u201d I explained. \u201cIs that okay with you?\u201d</p><p>He blinked at me, but nodded his assent.</p><p>It was a picture of him when he was fourteen, at some red carpet function. He was posing for the camera, but it was a far different pose from the polished one he had adopted as an adult. His dark blond hair had just brushed his shoulders even then, perfectly coifed, his dusky skin perfect. His face was solemn and serious, his turquoise eyes haughty and fierce. He had been no more than a child, but the man he would become shone through every arrogant line of his face.</p><p>It fascinated me, how his strong character shone at such a tender age. I wanted to make it into a portrait shot that he could hang on some fireplace mantle at one of his many estates. Perhaps it could be a legacy for his children.</p><p>\u201cYou were like a baby supermodel,\u201d I said as he went back to his seat.</p><p>He shot me a wry smile. \u201cI detested the way I looked back then. I thought it made my business associates take me less seriously. Typical fourteen-year-old reasoning. It didn\u2019t even occur to me that being fourteen did that all on it\u2019s own.\u201d</p><p>I studied him, trying to hide the sympathy I felt for a fourteen-year-old James, who\u2019d had far too heavy of a burden to bear.</p><p>\u201cI wish I\u2019d known you back then. I bet we would have been friends.\u201d</p><p>He gave me a warm look. \u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t homeless, but you didn\u2019t have anyone, like I did, to turn to for comfort. I think I got the better deal.\u201d</p><p>He gave me a sad little smile. \u201cYou may be right there.\u201d</p><p>I took the printout of the photo across the room, beginning a rough sketch, loving all of the new supplies.</p><p>He\u2019d thought of everything I could possibly need.</p><p>\u201cOh, I forgot,\u201d James said. I glanced back at him. He was holding my phone. \u201cYour reception isn\u2019t great out here, but Stephan has been trying to get ahold of you. You can call him from my phone.\u201d</p><p>I realized belatedly that I had forgotten I\u2019d even had a phone since we\u2019d arrived at the ranch.</p><p>He carried the other phone to me, already set to dial Stephan. I pushed the button, thanking him.</p><p>An excited Stephan answered after one ring. It took me a long moment to piece together his hyper chattering.</p><p>I blinked, glancing at James. He was working intently at his computer.</p><p>\u201cIt even has the white grill and the black racing stripe that I was obsessed with. It\u2019s like he took every piece of information he ever heard me say about my dream car and just ordered it.\u201d</p><p>Stephan had been going on and on about the brand new Dodge Challenger that James had delivered to his driveway for several minutes, before I got a word in.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s amazing, Stephan.\u201d I listened as he added several excited details. \u201cYes, James is unerringly thoughtful. I\u2019m so happy for you.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t get a word in for another solid five minutes while Stephan went on and on about his extravagant gift. Finally, he asked to speak to James, wanting to thank him personally.</p><p>James took the phone from me with good grace, smiling as he told Stephan, \u201cIt is the best way I could think of to thank you for watching out for our Bianca for all these years. I\u2019m indebted to you.\u201d He paused with a laugh as he was obviously interrupted by a frenzied Stephan. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what. Let\u2019s schedule a meeting when we\u2019re both in New York. I want to discuss a few business matters with you.\u201d James listened politely to the response. \u201cThat will work fine. Yes, I\u2019ll do that. Okay, have a good one, Stephan.\u201d With that, he hung up.</p><p>I eyed him suspiciously. \u201cWhat are you up to now?\u201d I asked him ungraciously. But I just knew that he was somehow meddling in my life.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cStephan is your family. I want to take care of him. And I do feel strongly indebted to him for the way he\u2019s protected you. Also, I\u2019ve found that it pays to be on his good side.\u201d</p><p>I studied him, wanting to be annoyed at his interference, but I just couldn\u2019t. He had found something that made Stephan so happy. How could I help but be thankful to him for it? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThank you for doing that for him,\u201d I finally said. \u201cHe\u2019s been obsessed with the new Challenger since it came out. And his obsession for old muscle cars goes way back. There\u2019s not a gift in the world that he would love more than what you\u2019ve done.\u201d</p><p>He just smiled at me, shrugging like it was no more than the most simple of gifts to give someone their dream car. \u201cAnd what would be your dream car?\u201d he asked me.</p><p>I gave him a warning look. \u201cDon\u2019t even think of it. I have a car. I bought it with my own money, and I like it just fine.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t let up, even with the clear warning in my voice. \u201cEventually, you\u2019ll realize that what\u2019s mine is yours, and when you do, you can buy whatever you like. I want you to start growing accustomed to the idea.\u201d</p> <p>I took deep breaths as he spoke, trying to calm the panic that bloomed inside of me at his words.</p><p>Was he trying to take over my life? It was a dark, terrifying thought for me.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d I told him on a gasp.</p><p>His expression became more closed off, but his tone was as steady as before. \u201cI understand that you need time. I\u2019m trying to give you as much time as I can bear, Bianca.\u201d</p><p>My eyes widened at his words. Clearly, the man was deranged. \u201cWe\u2019ve only known each other for a month, and most of that time we weren\u2019t even in contact with each other. You call that giving me time?\u201d</p> <p>His expression, his voice, didn\u2019t alter. \u201cThe lack of contact was not of my choosing. And I\u2019ve always been decisive about what I want. When I see it, I take action. This is just how I am. I am trying to be patient, but I have no reservations about what I want from you, what I want our relationship to be. I am trying to respect the fact that you don\u2019t feel the same. I\u2019m just asking you to start growing accustomed to the idea of living together.\u201d</p><p>I took several deep breaths, watching him sitting so calmly behind his desk. \u201cI don\u2019t know that I can ever give you what you want. I\u2019m almost positive, in fact, that I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>His gaze hardened, but his voice was very even. \u201cAnd I am determined to convince you otherwise.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER SIXTEEN</p><p>We didn\u2019t speak for a long time after his pronouncement.</p><p>I didn\u2019t know what to say to him. He couldn\u2019t know me well enough to understand how impossible what he wanted was for me. I could give him control in bed, but I was utterly incapable of giving him control over the other parts of my life. Doing so would trap me. And I knew too well that I couldn\u2019t be trapped and helpless ever again. It had almost destroyed me as a child. It had most certainly destroyed my mother.</p> <p>I began the prep-work for my painting, but I felt a little too distracted to work at all efficiently. I sketched for nearly an hour before James spoke again.</p><p>\u201cI spoke to the manager of my L.A gallery recently. She\u2019s very excited about your debut. She and my New York manager actually had a little tiff over who would get your showing. Due to the desert landscapes, we leaned towards an L.A showing. She will start putting the showing together as soon as you give the go ahead.\u201d</p><p>I just stared at him, dumbfounded. The idea of showing my work was still a foreign concept to me. And so much had happened since he\u2019d had samples of my work shipped to his galleries.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have to attend the showing, do I?\u201d I asked, the thought daunting and unwelcome.</p><p>He looked genuinely surprised. \u201cWell, no. I suppose you don\u2019t have to. But why wouldn\u2019t you want to?\u201d</p><p>I gave him an exasperated look. \u201cThe press hates me. They will crucify my work if they find out it\u2019s attached to me in any way. I would prefer not to use my own name for the work, as well.\u201d</p><p>He looked troubled at the thought. Those exquisite eyes of his were raw with it. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry you\u2019ve been dragged into this media circus of a life. It\u2019s my fault they hate you. The things I\u2019ve seen printed about you...it makes me feel murderous.\u201d</p><p>I held up a hand at his tirade. \u201cFault isn\u2019t the issue. We need to deal with the issues at hand, not whose at fault. And you have to admit that my showing won\u2019t be helped by the media attention my name and appearance would bring to it.\u201d</p> <p>He flushed a little, though I couldn\u2019t tell why. \u201cPlease just consider attending. You deserve to take pride in your work, and to get credit for it. I would love it if you would allow me to escort you to the event, but by all means take some time to think about it. I\u2019ll have Sandra prep your work and hold off on the date until you decide what you want to do.\u201d</p><p>I nodded that I understood, but still dwelled on it as I worked. If I was brave, I would just go through with the ordeal. It wasn\u2019t as though I\u2019d be forced to read the horrible reviews about my work.</p><p>I was so distracted that I made a mess of my initial sketch, finally having to just toss it and start over. I could hear James talking quietly on the phone or I would have turned on some music to relax. Finally, I put in some headphones and played the music on my phone, tucking it into the pocket of my jeans. The picture started to come together after that, the sketch much closer to the image I had in my head of what I wanted.</p><p>We worked for hours like that, in relative peace and barely speaking. We worked for so long that I even began the painting process, which sometimes took me several sessions to advance to. I liked to have a very good sketch, usually, before I broke out the paint.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure what it was, but suddenly, I just felt a change in the air, a shift of energy. The hair on the nape of my neck stood on end, and I turned slowly to look at James. He had his phone to his ear, but he watched me. His eyes were...haunted, as though he\u2019d just learned of a loved one\u2019s death.</p><p>I moved to him, removing my earbuds. He just watched me, not taking the phone from his ear.</p><p>\u201cThank you for the update.\u201d He just listened for a long time. \u201cYes, it is. Keep looking into it. And double your search efforts.\u201d He hung up after that, but watched me almost warily.</p><p>I perched on the desk facing him, his laptop near my hip.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happened?\u201d I asked, knowing with a certainty that something had.</p><p>\u201cMy investigators just found out from the police that your father has a warrant out not just for assault and battery, but also for murder.\u201d He just stared at me for a long time, a torment in his eyes that was becoming familiar to me. Those dear eyes.</p><p>I cupped his cheek, bracing myself. \u201cYes, I know,\u201d I told him reluctantly.</p><p>\u201cI let a murderer lay his hands on you,\u201d he told me in an agonized whisper.</p><p>I cupped his face in my other hand, as well. \u201cThat\u2019s an unreasonable way to look at it. I\u2019ve known he was a killer since I was fourteen, long before I knew you, and he\u2019s laid his hands on me many times since then.\u201d</p><p>He blinked at me, as though my words were beginning to register past his shock and fear.</p><p>\u201cYou knew he had killed someone?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I nodded, my mouth tight, my chest aching. \u201cI\u2019m the one who reported him to the police, though I was nearly a decade too late. It was my mother that he killed. I was the only witness. I was standing close enough to touch her when he did it. I lied to the police for him for all these years. But after this last attack, I realized that I couldn\u2019t live like that anymore. I can\u2019t run anymore, even if it means he kills me, too.\u201d</p><p>His eyes were so panicked and vulnerable that, unwillingly, I felt my own fill suddenly with tears. It was hard to believe I\u2019d gone years without crying before I met James. But the things he made me feel had opened a floodgate, and the damned thing wouldn\u2019t close.</p><p>I continued, wanting to get it all out. \u201cI felt so guilty, for all of these years, for dishonoring her memory, for helping her killer run free, but inside I was such a scared child that I just couldn\u2019t go back to the police. After he killed her, they just took his word at face value, never even interviewing me in a separate room from him, and I knew that he would kill me if I told. I was absolutely certain that not even the police could stop him. Even years later, when I hadn\u2019t had contact with him at all, I tried to go to the police, but just got cold feet every time.\u201d</p><p>I brushed his hair out of his stricken face with a soft touch, wanting to comfort the things I saw in his eyes so clearly. It was such a reflection of my own torment. His soul was a mirror of my own. Perhaps his insane claim that we were made for each other wasn\u2019t so very far off the mark. I had known him for such a short time, but sometimes I felt I could read him so perfectly, so naturally, that it astounded me.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t bear the burden of protecting me from my father,\u201d I told him gently. \u201cNo one can. And you couldn\u2019t have known that he would seek me out to threaten me to stay silent, because you didn\u2019t know about my mother, of course. But you are responsible for helping me to find the strength to finally tell the truth. Thank you for that.\u201d</p><p>It nearly broke me when one lone tear rolled down his cheek. \u201cIt just keeps hitting me, over and over again, that I really did come close to losing you forever. I can\u2019t bear the thought.\u201d His voice was a rough whisper. \u201cAnd he\u2019s still out there, loose, so you\u2019re essentially in as much, if not more, danger than ever.</p><p>I\u2019m glad you got to finally tell the truth, but it still terrifies me what that truth might mean for you.\u201d</p><p>I traced the tear down his cheek, catching it right at his perfect jaw. He didn\u2019t seem bothered by the tear. He was so much braver than I with his feelings, I knew, but he still managed to surprise me with his depths.</p><p>I tried to put myself in his shoes briefly. If his uncle was still alive, and capable of hurting him, even killing him, but just lay in wait for the right opportunity...It would make me insane. But could James feel for me what I felt for him? I just couldn\u2019t picture it, even though he obviously felt at least something.</p><p>Neither of us seemed capable of working after both of our emotional outbursts.</p><p>We ate dinner in silence. It was a spicy chicken chili. I ate quickly, polishing off the comfort food without tasting it properly.</p><p>We went to bed early, James mentioning that we needed to rise early to get a proper ride in, beating the worst heat of the day.</p><p>I got ready for bed with little comment. I felt as though I hadn\u2019t slept for days as I lay on his exquisitely comfortable bed and closed my eyes. I sighed in contentment when I felt James wrapping himself around me.</p><p>I swiftly drifted into a deep and peaceful sleep.</p><p>CHAPTER SEVENTEEN</p><p>James woke me up with a light kiss on the forehead. I blinked awake, surprised to find him already dressed in clean riding clothes and leaning over me. He began to dress me without a word.</p><p>My riding clothes were much different this time. My tight pants were made up of a thin black material, not much thicker than tights, and reached just past my knees. I took note of the fact that he didn\u2019t bother with putting any panties on me.</p><p>He worked snug, thigh-high black chaps onto each of my legs slowly. I touched the soft suede material, running my fingers over it.</p><p>He was arranging the chaps over my riding boots when he spoke. \u201cThe full chaps are normally worn with jeans. I\u2019ll pack a pair, for the ride back.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I digested his words, my mind going to dark, sensual places with it.</p><p>He pulled me to my feet, dragging my thin shift over my head in one smooth motion. He ran his tongue over his teeth as he studied my naked torso.</p><p>I had to stifle the urge to cover my bare breasts. Clearly, I was not as comfortable with casual nudity as Mr. Beautiful.</p><p>He zipped me into a thick sports bra, pulling a tight, thin shirt over my head.</p> <p>He braided my hair, keeping his hands, disappointingly, to himself. I was still turned on at his every motion.</p><p>I closed my eyes as he spread sunblock over my face very carefully. The man thought of everything.</p><p>He slapped my ass, hard, when he finished. \u201cLet\u2019s go for a ride, Love,\u201d he told me with a wicked smile, taking my hand.</p><p>The horses were saddled and ready when we got to the stables. It was the first time I got to see James\u2019s stallion.</p><p>He introduced me to Devil by handing me an apple, and a warning. \u201cCareful, he bites.\u201d</p> <p>I fed the huge beast carefully, admiring his exceptional coat. I ran my fingers over his blue-black mane.</p><p>His coat was a blueish gray color, so dark it shone in the sunlight like blue fire. His fur got much darker at his face, nose and feet, almost black-tipped. He seemed like a stallion out of a fairy tail, his coat too astonishingly colored to be real.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s amazing,\u201d I told James, running my hands along his smooth neck. Another horse butted my back from behind. I laughed when I saw that it was Princess.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s jealous.\u201d James wore an indulgent smile as he ran a hand along Princess\u2019s neck.</p><p>I had thought she was an exceptionally tall horse, but she was almost short compared to Demon. I patted her, as well.</p><p>James handed me another apple to give to the friendly palomino.</p> <p>Pete was nearby, but kept a careful distance. He had obviously been the one to saddle the horses for us, but was wise enough to stay away from his boss after the episode of the day before.</p><p>He had merely nodded politely as we had passed him in the stables.</p><p>I had nodded back with a small smile.</p><p>Nevertheless, James\u2019s hand had tightened significantly at the small exchange.</p><p>Impossibly jealous man, I thought to myself, but kept my own council.</p><p>\u201cDemon is a rare blue roan thoroughbred,\u201d James told me, feeding a carrot to the oversized stallion.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t even know that horses could be blue,\u201d I told him with a sheepish smile. I really didn\u2019t know a thing about horses, I was quickly realizing.</p><p>\u201cNormally it\u2019s just an expression for a bluish tinge to a horse. Demon is a truly unusual shade, though, almost more blue than gray.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAn outrageously beautiful horse, for an outrageously beautiful man,\u201d I told him with a smile.</p><p>He tugged on my braid, tilting my head back. His eyes were hot as they looked into mine. \u201cWhatever keeps you around, Love,\u201d he said, fitting a sleek black helmet carefully onto my head. I saw with no surprise that it exactly matched his own.</p><p>He worked black leather gloves onto my hands, patiently working them on, tightening them at the wrists.</p><p>\u201cYou know, I\u2019m fully capable of dressing myself,\u201d I told him, but I knew it was pointless. I knew that he loved to tend to me, no task too insignificant for his attention.</p><p>He just smiled in response, kissing my leather clad knuckles. He worked on his own gloves next, and I watched, transfixed, as he worked them onto his powerful hands. His fingers were long and elegant, but so very strong. I watched his tan hands disappear into the black leather, and flushed, remembering the feel of those gloved hands punishing me.</p><p>He saw my stare and gave me a wicked smile. \u201cYou remember these?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, still watching, captivated, as he worked on the gloves. Even his hands were an obscenely tempting sight to me.</p><p>\u201cI love your hands. So much.\u201d My voice was already breathless.</p><p>He threw his head back and laughed. I was captivated by the sight. Even his smooth, golden throat was perfect, and I wanted to bury my face there.</p><p>I had to stifle the urge. He was obviously on a schedule this morning.</p><p>He gave me the warmest smile as his laughter faded.</p><p>He gave me a short, sweet kiss, and lifted me by the hips to mount the Princess. I mounted how I had been taught, swiftly trying to position myself into the seat correctly.</p><p>\u201cPerfect,\u201d he told me, unhooking the lead rope attached to Princess\u2019s bridle and roping it over the fence post.</p><p>I felt a wonderful little thrill as I got to watch the amazing sight of James vaulting up onto Devil in one smooth motion. He was such an elegant man, but his strength was astounding. Muscles bunched under his tight shirt, his breeches snug enough to show the cut of his thigh muscles as he moved.</p><p>He passed me on his horse, pausing to finger my collar, apparent just above the neckline of my top.</p><p>\u201cI should get a lead rope for this, as well,\u201d he murmured, clicking his horse to go.</p><p>\u201cFollow me,\u201d he ordered, as he rode to the gate that Pete had just opened without a word.</p><p>I followed, Princess moving into a brisk walk with the slightest pressure of my heels.</p><p>He led me into the thick woods, the barest hint of a trail guiding our way.</p><p>I admired the scenery as we walked, trying to move with the horse and keep my seat nice and smooth. It was so peaceful and calm there. The trees covered us in cool shade, and it was early enough that the weather was perfect for a long ride.</p><p>The forest always made me feel that I had been transported to another world, another time. The solitude, the serenity, had my mind drifting into fantasyland. The pine trees were incredibly tall there, the foliage thick and little purple wild flowers dotted the ground whimsically.</p><p>It was almost jarring when we passed out of the thicker forest and onto a trail pronounced and wide enough to be a small road. James stopped there, waiting for me to reign in beside him.</p><p>He sent me a sidelong, wicked look. \u201cHow do you feel? Are you sore?\u201d</p><p>I just shook my head. I sucked in a breath as he brought a gloved hand to the waist of his skin tight pants.</p><p>He laid his reigns on his horses neck, giving a firm command for Demon to stay. Then he proceeded to undo the thick buttons on his pants, folding them down and under his thick manhood. It jutted up proudly, already so thick and hard that my mouth watered at the sight. He shrugged out of his shirt in a smooth motion, tucking it into one of his chaps.</p><p>I just drank in the sight of his gleaming golden flesh, always amazed at his perfection. The muscles of his chiseled bronze abs were visibly working as he sat his horse. Somehow, his legs being covered, and being on horseback, made his nudity all the more obscene. And unbelievably hot.</p><p>He gave me his wicked grin, and I nearly melted. \u201cCome here,\u201d he ordered.</p><p>I obeyed, my horse sidling towards him eagerly.</p><p>He snatched me up, swinging me to straddle him in a seemingly easy motion. My eyes were on the hard play of muscles in his magnificent arms.</p><p>He perched me just in front of him, almost on Demon\u2019s neck.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t move,\u201d he ordered, pulling a rather large pocket knife from his boot. He worked me onto his thighs, until I was just inches from his jutting cock.</p><p>I sucked in a startled breath as he used the knife on the waistband of my pants, cutting towards himself.</p><p>He cut to a few inches above the saddle, putting the knife back in his boot. He ripped my pants the rest of the way off. The initial sound of ripping made Demon start, but James calmed him with a few soothing words, still ripping away, until I wore only the chaps. My sex looked profoundly bare and obscene, surrounded by black suede chaps and nothing else, my top half still completely covered.</p><p>James reached behind me, rearranging the reigns, untying them to make them longer, and wrapping them around his right arm. He was giving Demon free reign, controlling him with his legs, as he\u2019d said he would teach me to do.</p><p>He used firm hands on my hips to lift me up and poised me on the tip of his erection. He touched my sex with only his cock, moving his hips in small circles to spread my growing moisture onto his eager tip.</p><p>I moaned, jerking my hips. I wanted him to impale me so badly, just a quick thrust to ease the ache.</p><p>He did, his head jerking back to look up at me, his jaw clenched at the excruciatingly tight fit. He thrust straight to the hilt, and I melted around him.</p><p>\u201cOh, James,\u201d I cried out with feeling. Even with him full inside of me, I still ached. My hips jerked in a request for movement. James clicked, and Demon began to walk. James moved with him, an expert rider, each movement of his hips a little thrust inside of me. My legs almost dangled behind his, my body had submitted to him so completely.</p><p>We watched each other as he moved inside of me, the movements half thrusts that left me gasping for more.</p><p>\u201cDo you want a posting trot, Bianca?\u201d James asked, his voice a growl.</p><p>I thought of the exaggerated movements of a posting trot. Oh God, yes, I wanted tha t.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I moaned.</p><p>\u201cBeg me for it,\u201d he said, in a strangely calm voice. How was he not more winded?</p><p>\u201cPlease, Mr. Cavendish, bring us to a posting trot.\u201d</p><p>He just tsk\u2019d at me impatiently. \u201cThat was a sad excuse for begging, Bianca. Now you only get the sitting trot.\u201d He clicked Demon into a trot, keeping his seat. He sat the trot so smoothly, it barely increased his thrusting from the walk.</p><p>I moaned at him in distress, gripping his shoulders now. I needed more. I needed the deep thrusting that I had so quickly grown addicted to.</p><p>Our eyes never strayed from each other, his intense turquoise gaze imprinting itself on me inexorably.</p><p>\u201cI beg you, Mr. Cavendish,\u201d I tried again. \u201cPlease, fuck me at a posting trot. Please, please, please.\u201d</p><p>His eyes smoldered at me, and he clicked the horse into the faster trot. \u201cThat is the tone I was looking for. Hold on, Love.\u201d</p><p>He lifted me higher, his posting trot thrusting him into me with the longest, hardest strokes. I was close to screaming within seconds of the new rhythm.</p><p>\u201cCome,\u201d James growled, his eyelids heavy as he watched me. He impaled me hard and to the hilt as he spoke, and I fell apart in his arms. I was gasping, back in the ride again as he pulled out of me, dragging along each sensitive nerve. I was in a fever dream as he continued to thrust. I came again to his harsh command. And yet again, before he found his own rough release, shouting my name, his eyes going from hard and commanding to tender as the rapture took him.</p><p>He kissed me, still buried deep inside of me, as we floated back to reality, Demon slowing to an aimless walk.</p><p>I broke the spell several minutes later when I pulled back from his long kiss. \u201cHave you ever done that before?\u201d</p><p>His eyes shuttered, and I knew I wouldn\u2019t like his answer. \u201cMade love on horseback?\u201d he asked.</p><p>My eyes narrowed, taking immediate exception to his wording. He seemed to me to be splitting hairs.</p><p>\u201cFucked someone on horseback,\u201d I corrected.</p><p>He flushed, and my vision went a little red, knowing his answer. \u201cI\u2019ve fucked a woman on horseback before, but it wasn\u2019t like that. It was far more technical, almost clinical. It was more about seeing if it could be done, for me, than the actual doing. And I was barely an adult at the time.\u201d He studied me, his eyes wide as he read the iciness that was blooming there. \u201cPlease don\u2019t try to demean what we just shared.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I heard his words as if at a distance, my mind suddenly recalling an appalling little detail I\u2019d read in a tabloid, about James and Jules both coming from affluent English families who both shared a long history as avid equestrians.</p><p>\u201cWas it her?\u201d I asked in a whisper, my eyes narrowed.</p><p>He squeezed me more tightly against him, as if sensing a threat. He buried his face in my neck before he spoke. \u201cWho are you referring to?\u201d</p><p>I stiffened even more. \u201cJules,\u201d I said, my voice going glacial.</p> <p>I felt him sigh against me. \u201cIt was. But it didn\u2019t mean anything. Please don\u2019t use her to keep me at a distance.\u201d</p><p>I tried to move off of him, but he had me at a severe disadvantage, and he wasn\u2019t letting me go.</p><p>Instead, he clicked Demon back into a brisk walk.</p><p>CHAPTER EIGHTEEN</p><p>He began to move inside of me again, his erection swiftly growing and hardening, as though it were a parlor trick.</p> <p>I gasped, slapping at his shoulders. \u201cYou can\u2019t use sex to subdue me,\u201d I told him. I was hurt and angry, but also unwillingly and wildly aroused.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t withdraw from me every time you get mad or jealous. We need to talk this out. I\u2019m not letting you go until we do.\u201d</p><p>I pulled on his hair, hard, but my hips were already moving unbidden with his thrusts. \u201cYou call this talking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI call this making love, and yes, talking.\u201d He tried to smile at me. I yanked on his sweaty hair. He winced, but made no move to stop me.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you keep calling it that? Why do you keep calling it making love?\u201d</p><p>He gave me a smoldering look. \u201cYou know why. You keep trying to belittle what we have, but you need to understand that it\u2019s as new to me as it is to you. I have a past. A wildly sordid past. I can\u2019t change it. I would if I could. You are going to run into a lot of my ex-lovers. That\u2019s an unfortunate fact.</p> <p>It will be a lot less painful for you if you can just get it into your head that none of them were anything but a fuck to me. And fucking was nothing to me before I met you. Sex was a bodily function to me before I met you. That\u2019s why I call this making love. It means something to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never even had a girlfriend before you, never even considered the idea. I\u2019m sure it sounds callous, but no woman has ever been anything to me beyond a fuck, a sub, or a friend, occasionally all three, though never all of them for long. They all knew the score. I was brutally honest with every single one of them, without exception. You are the one that I want, the one that I need. So getting upset about my past, or feeling jealous of women I\u2019ve been with, is unwarranted.\u201d</p><p>He never stopped moving as he spoke, and I felt emotionally charged.</p><p>\u201cUnwarranted?\u201d The word burst out of me, angry and wounded. \u201cI\u2019ve years worth of pictures of you going out with Jules. How can you expect me to dismiss that out of hand?\u201d I gasped as he thrust harder, a deliberate motion, his eyes intense. \u201cUnfair,\u201d I muttered. \u201cAnd you are hardly one to talk. I was a virgin when I met you, but you\u2019re still jealous of every man I speak to. That\u2019s unwarranted.\u201d</p><p>He lifted me up and down for several long, fast strokes before he spoke. He was playing me like a drum, I knew. It was very hard to stick to my point when I was insanely turned on, and in the middle of getting thoroughly fucked. \u201cWhen I was about eighteen, the paparazzi were hounding me relentlessly, printing silly stories that drove me crazy. They were hiding in the bushes when I left school. It was out of control.\u201d</p><p>I tried my hardest to focus on his words, but he wasn\u2019t helping, still moving inside of me tirelessly.</p><p>\u201cYou know how I need control,\u201d he growled.</p><p>He thrust harder, clicking Demon into a hard trot. He clicked again, and the motion took us into a canter. This movement was unfamiliar to my limited riding skills, and I clutched at James\u2019s shoulders in panic. His thrusts were more measured at this pace. I was falling apart almost instantly.</p> <p>\u201cCome,\u201d he ordered roughly. It took me over the edge. He slowed back to a walk, but still didn\u2019t stop.</p><p>\u201cYou know how I need control,\u201d he repeated. \u201cBut the things they were doing were completely out of my control, and I realized one day that the press was like a garden hose,\u201d he explained.</p><p>I blinked at him, dazed and confused. \u201cA garden hose?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He gave me a gentle smile, enjoying the complete loss of my composure. \u201cA garden hose. If you turn it on too lightly, you can\u2019t control the flow. It just drips where it will. But if you turn it to full force, you can control the flow, sending it wherever you want. So I began to court the paparazzi, rather than ducking away. I encouraged their attentions by charming them, and publicly, becoming an open book. Or rather, making it appear that way. Jules was my best friend\u2019s sister, and occasionally, a very casual lover of mine, and we\u2019d been friends for awhile. We were seen out and about together, since we traveled in the same circles. I quickly noticed that she loved the attention, encouraging rumors about us shamelessly, even leaking lies to the press about us.\u201d</p><p>His eyes were solemn and serious on my face as he continued, \u201cI see now that it was stupid to let her take it so far, but at the time I couldn\u2019t see a problem with it. Other women thought she and I had an open relationship, so no one tried for anything more with me. It saved me from worse misunderstandings, for a time. I see that it looks bad, but I want you to trust me that that\u2019s all it was. Jules is not someone you need to worry about.\u201d</p><p>He began to move in earnest after that little speech, and he undid me yet again, bringing me to release at a trot. I sobbed his name, gripping his hair in tight fists. He came with me that time, his eyes going so soft that unwanted tears pricked my eyes.</p><p>He slowed Demon to a walk. He leaned me back slightly, his eyes moving down to where our bodies joined. He ran his tongue over his model perfect teeth as he studied the sight. My own gaze followed his. The sight that greeted me made my barely steadied breath catch.</p><p>I was still impaled on him, my moisture mixing with his on the thick base of his shaft as he shifted me slightly up and back.</p><p>His voice was low with pleasure when he spoke. \u201cYou\u2019re so full of my semen right now. You\u2019re stuffed full of my cock and my cum. I want to keep you like this forever. I might have gotten you pregnant just now, if you weren\u2019t on the pill.\u201d</p><p>His words made me stiffen, the sensual haze lifting from me in an instant. I tried to shift off of him. He had to help me lift off of his semi-hard length.</p><p>He pulled me flush against him, his cock between us. \u201cWrap your arms and legs around me tightly. I\u2019m going to dismount. Too much more of this and I\u2019ll make you too raw to fuck for days.\u201d</p><p>I did as he said. \u201cI thought it was making love,\u201d I told him archly.</p><p>He sent me a censorious look. \u201cSassy girl.\u201d</p><p>He set me on unsteady feet, leaning me against Demon when I swayed.</p><p>\u201cGet your balance. I need to catch Princess.\u201d</p><p>He fastened his trousers while he walked away. Princess was still visible, though she was quite a ways behind us. It seemed she had been trailing us, albeit slowly.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t noticed, for obvious reasons.</p><p>Demon didn\u2019t protest as I leaned against him heavily, watching James stride to Princess purposefully, vaulting onto her back in that smooth motion that seemed impossible, given the height. He rode her back to us at a smooth canter, stopping smoothly beside us and dismounting with the grace of a panther.</p><p>He studied me from head to foot, his eyes lingering appreciatively on the sight of my bared sex. He moved to a pouch on his saddle as he spoke. \u201cI take it from your reaction that you don\u2019t want children any time soon.\u201d His tone was almost idle, as though it were the most casual topic in the world.</p><p>I looked at him incredulously. \u201cOr ever. I\u2019m way too fucked up to ever be a mother,\u201d I said, my tone final.</p><p>He didn\u2019t take the hint. \u201cWhy would you think that? Because of your childhood?\u201d He turned to look at me as he pulled a rolled up pair of jeans from the pouch.</p><p>\u201cYes, of course, because of that. My mind is too clouded with dark things. Mother\u2019s are supposed to be, I don\u2019t know, happy, and full of love. They should be able to give and receive love, and I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m capable of that.\u201d I flushed at what I\u2019d revealed. I was embarrassed by how screwed up I was, but he needed to know.</p><p>He moved to me as I spoke, cupping my cheeks, his eyes impossibly tender. \u201cOh, Bianca, that\u2019s just not true. You think only the people with perfect childhoods should be parents?\u201d</p><p>I mulled it over, finding the answer easily. \u201cOf course not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou probably think someone like me should never be a father.\u201d</p><p>I blinked, mortified that he would think such a thing. \u201cOf course not. I think you\u2019ll be great at it, when you have children. You\u2019re so patient, and controlled.\u201d</p><p>He stroked my cheeks, giving me a look so intense that I had to fight the urge not to look away. It was so much like trying to stare into the sun. \u201cSo will you. But if you never want to have children, I can live with that, as well.\u201d</p><p>My heart stopped, just stopped, then began to pound as though I\u2019d just run a marathon. \u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d</p><p>He kissed me, a long, heated kiss. \u201cNothing. You just aren\u2019t ready to talk about this. I don\u2019t want to scare you off again.\u201d</p><p>I took deep breaths, trying not to panic at what I knew he\u2019d almost said.</p><p>He shrugged the whole thing off, slinging my jeans over his shoulder and digging back into the saddlebag. He pulled out some packed wet cloths, unbuttoning his trousers to wipe our mingled fluids off.</p><p>I watched him touch himself, biting my lip. How could I still want him with such desperation when he\u2019d just had me, again and again? I didn\u2019t know, but there it was.</p><p>He disposed of the wipe in a small bag, taking out more wipes to clean me. His gaze was scorching as he cleaned me, eyeing me from top to bottom in a sexy once over.</p><p>\u201cKeep looking at me like that if you want to get fucked against a horse,\u201d he warned.</p><p>I looked away, moving against his searching fingers as he cleaned me. He smacked my bare ass roughly with his other hand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying not to fuck you raw. Don\u2019t make it harder.\u201d His tone was so stern that I just got more turned on.</p><p>I closed my eyes, still biting my lip.</p><p>He growled, dragging me over to a tree. He placed my hands against the rough trunk. \u201cDon\u2019t move an inch. You need a good spanking. You\u2019re just lucky that you need to ride back, or I\u2019d spank you raw, you little minx.\u201d</p><p>I arched my back, my body running the show.</p><p>He growled again, and began to spank me, his leather-clad gloves smarting at the first blow.</p><p>I moaned, shifting around. He stopped after ten, breathing hard.</p><p>He was entering me without warning an instant later, cupping my breasts, his breath rough and heavy in my ear. \u201cJust one quick, gentle ride. I can\u2019t fucking think straight, I want you so bad. Don\u2019t move, this needs to be quick and soft.\u201d</p><p>I let out a ragged laugh at his description of being fucked against a tree by his impressive cock \u2018gentle\u2019 and \u2018soft\u2019. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It wasn\u2019t the jarring ride I usually craved. He moved in and out of me smoothly, crying out in my ear as he came, too fast for me to even keep up.</p><p>I was shocked at his release. He usually went for so long before coming himself. But, of course, he didn\u2019t leave me unsatisfied for long. He was turning me, kneeling in front of me, ripping a glove off impatiently with his teeth.</p><p>He buried his face between my legs with a rough moan, and I screamed as he purposefully made me come, using his tongue and fingers and just the barest hint of teeth, my hands gripping his silky hair all the while.</p><p>He cleaned us up again after that, shaking his head ruefully all the while. He had to strip off my chaps before he worked me into my panties and then tight jeans. They were new, but still fit perfectly. I wasn\u2019t even surprised by it anymore. He worked the chaps back up my legs swiftly and efficiently, as though he\u2019d done it a thousand times. I tried my best not to dwell on that fact.</p><p>\u201cI never thought I\u2019d have the urge to fuck someone to death,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>I giggled.</p><p>He gave me a little smirk as he led me back to Princess. He helped me mount, and I turned quickly, wanting to see him execute his own perfect mount once again. He did so effortlessly, taking the lead as we headed back to the ranch.</p><p>\u201cDid you need to get back to Vegas today or tomorrow?\u201d James asked, glancing back at me.</p><p>I grimaced, thinking about it. \u201cTonight. I\u2019d hate to push it and hit bad weather.\u201d</p><p>He sighed with resignation. \u201cOkay. We\u2019ll have lunch and head out.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER NINETEEN</p><p>We were heading back to Vegas in way too short a time. So much had happened in our short reprieve.</p><p>James had weakened my resolve to keep my distance in that way he had, with his persistence and his willpower. He was not a man to be deterred. And for whatever reason, he seemed resolute in his desire to be with me. And wanting me for something more permanent than I\u2019d ever thought he would even consider. Living together didn\u2019t terrify me, as marriage did, but I couldn\u2019t say that I was even approaching comfortable with it.</p><p>We were both quiet for the drive, and then the flight. I didn\u2019t mind. I had a lot to think about, and James seemed lost in his own thoughts, not even getting his laptop out to get some work done on the flight.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll stay at your house tonight,\u201d James said, as we touched down in Vegas. It was the first thing he\u2019d said in an hour. I studied him. He seemed a little distant, a little sad.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m having some work done on my place,\u201d he explained. \u201cI\u2019ll finally give you a tour of the property sometime next week.\u201d</p><p>I just nodded, but he hadn\u2019t been asking me a question.</p><p>We went to bed early that night. James could see that I was exhausted from the riding and the traveling, and oh yeah, the phenomenal fucking.</p><p>He did his kinky little exam of my body. It had become a habit of his. I felt well enough, mostly tired, and a little sore, but he insisted on checking every inch of me. He softly kissed shadow bruises still on my ribs and back, the abrasions on my wrists and ankles, and even turned me around to check my butt, for soreness from the saddle. He studied my sex last, his eyes heavy-lidded as he touched me ever so gently, fingers sifting through my folds.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be the kinkiest wannabe doctor on the planet,\u201d I told him with a half smile.</p><p>His mouth turned up faintly at the corners. He took it as a challenge. The comment seemed to inspire him to be kinkier.</p><p>He\u2019d brought a glass of ice water into the room, and he grabbed it from the beside table, taking a long drink. One of his hands still held my inner thigh, keeping my legs pushed wide apart and my body pinned to my spot right at the edge of the mattress.</p><p>He bent, burying his face between my legs. I gasped as he pushed an ice cube inside of me with his clever tongue. He lapped at me like a cat for a moment before straightening again. He took another long drink, repeating the process. My hands fisted in his silky hair, begging him silently for release, but he took his time. He stroked me, and licked me, and sat back, just to look at me, again and again. He pushed a finger into me, thrusting, but I wanted more.</p> <p>\u201cPlease, James, I want you inside of me.\u201d</p><p>He bit the bottom lip of that pretty mouth, but didn\u2019t respond, just kept up the process.</p><p>I was shivering, chills wracking me from both desire and the delectable feeling of cold ice inside of me.</p><p>He had shoved five cubes in deep.</p><p>He took another ice cube and began to run it along my belly, circling my navel in almost lazy motions.</p><p>Next he ran the ice up along my ribs, then traced my sternum. My nipples were already pebbled long before he\u2019d payed them any personal attention. I shivered and shuddered as he finally circled a quivering nipple.</p><p>The ice wasn\u2019t the only cold thing he\u2019d brought into the bedroom with us, I realized after endless minutes of his teasing. His very demeanor was cold tonight, his eyes icy as he worked on me slowly, torturously.</p><p>\u201cAm I being punished?\u201d I asked him finally, when he held back from letting me come, pulling his busy fingers out of me just short of release.</p><p>He smiled, and even the smile was cold. \u201cNot exactly. This is only a lesson, Bianca. I\u2019m doing this to you for one simple reason. Because I can. This is what it means to be my submissive.\u201d</p><p>I writhed at that, his calculated actions bringing out a shivering fear that, perversely, made me want him even more.</p><p>\u201cWill you be fucking me tonight? Or is this all a tease? Because you can?\u201d</p><p>In answer, he buried his face between my legs again, his tongue circling my clit, his fingers going back to work inside of me. I felt the ice cubes clink together, and I moaned, right on the edge of orgasm. He straightened, leaving me bereft.</p><p>He stood, stripping out of his boxer briefs in one smooth motion. He was hard. At this point, I would have been more shocked if he wasn\u2019t. He stroked himself, looking down at me with that hard, stony expression. I bit my lip as I watched him stroke himself, once, twice. I was sobbing on his third stroke, drawing my legs up to my chest, wanting to touch myself, anything to ease the ache that the ice inside of me only antagonized. I pushed my legs down, lifting my hips into the air in a silent plea.</p><p>He stopped abruptly. \u201cNo,\u201d he finally answered. \u201cI\u2019m punishing myself tonight, so I won\u2019t be fucking you. Only you get to come tonight.\u201d</p><p>He bent down, and began the torture all over again. He\u2019d said I could come, but he hadn\u2019t said when, and he left me wanting for long minutes that felt like hours.</p><p>The first ice had melted, with new cubes replacing it, before he finally sucked me into a climax so hard that I sobbed out his name at the end, tears running down my cheeks.</p><p>He tried to hold me afterwards, and I turned away, trying to roll out of his reach. But my bed wasn\u2019t that big, and he was determined. He swatted my butt for the effort.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t turn away from me,\u201d he said in a hard voice, pulling my back against him.</p><p>I tried to fall asleep, but he began to touch me again, kneading my breasts until I was arching my back, brushing my backside against his stiff length.</p><p>\u201cYou can take me there,\u201d I told him, brushing my backside against him again. I hated that he was denying himself, whatever the reason.</p><p>He purred against me. \u201cNo release for me, not tonight. I keep pushing you too hard, even though you\u2019re injured and unaccustomed to this. I need a torturous night to reflect on my sins. Keep teasing me. I deserve it.\u201d</p><p>I stopped rubbing my butt against him, not willing to help him in that regard. He bit my neck, one hand snaking down to stroke my sex. \u201cYou don\u2019t want me to suffer, Love? You don\u2019t agree with the punishment I\u2019ve chosen for myself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said on a gasp.</p><p>He plunged his large fingers into me, starting up an exquisite rhythm.</p><p>\u201cI want to bring you pleasure, not punishment,\u201d I told him.</p><p>He grunted. \u201cWell, it\u2019s not up to you, is it?\u201d he asked, his fingers quickening, bringing me to orgasm quickly this time, a stark contrast to what he\u2019d done to me the first time.</p><p>He kept his fingers inside of me, a hand gripping my breast, and his stiff erection still pressed firmly against my butt.</p><p>\u201cGo to sleep, love,\u201d he whispered harshly in my ear.</p><p>I was so exhausted that I actually did.</p><p>James woke me in the morning in much the way he\u2019d put me to bed, his hand stroking me, his other kneading at my breast. He was sucking on that perfect spot on my neck, his rigid cock grinding against my butt in rhythm to his fingers.</p><p>\u201cAre you awake?\u201d he asked into my ear.</p><p>\u201cYes. Please, I need you inside me. Please don\u2019t deprive yourself again.\u201d I arched my back as I spoke.</p><p>He shifted me onto my back, but stayed on his side. He dragged me around until my wet entrance was pointed at his stiff member, throwing my legs over his hip. My head was nearly hanging off the side of the bed.</p><p>One of his arms was used to prop him up, but his other hand was free to roam over my body. He lingered on my breasts, plucking at my nipples.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to have special rings designed for these,\u201d he said, and rammed into me.</p><p>I didn\u2019t have a chance to ask him what he meant. I was too busy gasping as he began a jolting rhythm, still pulling on my breasts.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make them match your collar and your earrings. I want you dripping in diamonds. I\u2019ll decorate all of your chains with them. Before I\u2019m done with you, every part of your body will be stamped with my ownership.\u201d</p><p>My hands fisted in the sheets. It was all I could reach in this position. I used my legs to move with his thrusts, and he groaned in approval.</p><p>He had us both coming in swift moments, impatient from his night of torture.</p><p>\u201cDid you get any sleep last night?\u201d I asked him as we lay panting, spent.</p><p>\u201cA little. Though every time I drifted off, I woke up trying to violate you in your sleep. I need to rethink that punishment, I think.\u201d</p><p>I shifted until I could kiss him. It was a long, sweet kiss. He was surprisingly passive for it, as if he was curious to see what I would do.</p><p>I pulled back, touching his cheek. I knew my tenderness showed in my eyes. \u201cGet a little more sleep.</p><p>Please? At least rest while I go try to scrounge up breakfast.\u201d</p><p>He must have been exhausted, because he nodded, closing his eyes. He didn\u2019t open them as he raised my hand to his lips, kissing it softly.</p><p>I rose, pulling a sheet over him, and impulsively kissing his forehead before throwing on my tiny, nearly transparent shift. I grabbed a thong from my drawer full of the lacy things, even knowing I would be changing again soon, since I needed to shower after breakfast.</p><p>I padded into the kitchen, getting out anything I could find that went well with eggs. I cursed when I heard the loud sound of the garbage truck driving down my little street. I had already forgotten to put out my trash can the week before. I really needed to get it out to the curb before the truck passed my house.</p><p>I wouldn\u2019t normally go out front in my tiny slip of a nightgown, but I didn\u2019t have a spare moment to change.</p><p>Besides, I\u2019ll be quick. I told myself. I just needed to drag my one full garbage can out of the garage and onto the curb, then dart back in. And this was Vegas. See-through clothing was hardly unheard of, even in public. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I moved into the garage, punching the button to open my garage door. I was already dragging the can underneath the door when it was only halfway up. I was relieved to see that the garbage truck was a few houses away. I had made it in time.</p><p>I didn\u2019t notice the strange man blatantly photographing me until I was at the curb, lining up my garbage can.</p><p>I saw him, and just froze while he took shot after shot of me.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t galvanized into action until he looked up from the large camera, leering at me. \u201cThank you, Ms.</p> <p>Karlsson. Looking hot this morning.\u201d</p><p>He was a paunchy man, in his late forties, I guessed. Just the look on his face made my stomach churn. I was turning to rush back into the house when all hell broke loose.</p><p>A large man in a suit grabbed the greasy photographer, handling him roughly at the same time that the garage door into the kitchen burst open, a frantic, boxer clad James sprinting out. I heard clicks behind me, the photographer somehow managing to get a few shots of James, even while being restrained by a man much larger than himself. It was almost impressive.</p><p>I watched James\u2019s face as he took in the mess, watched it change from frantic to livid in a heartbeat. He looked like he wanted to murder the man as he strode to me, glaring at the paparazzi the entire time. He stepped in front of me, blocking me from view.</p><p>\u201cGet inside,\u201d he said through gritted teeth.</p> <p>I had seen his face. I couldn\u2019t imagine, from his look, that he didn\u2019t plan to do the man violence.</p><p>\u201cCome inside with me, please,\u201d I pleaded with him, my voice pitched low.</p><p>\u201cGo, Bianca. Now.\u201d</p><p>I hugged his back, not wanting him to get into trouble for some scumbag photographer.</p><p>\u201cYou look like you\u2019re going to attack him, James. I don\u2019t want you to go to jail.\u201d Even as I spoke, I heard a few more clicks from that damn camera. The man was fearless.</p><p>\u201cI would rather fucking go to jail than let him leave with those pictures of you. Now go inside.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYour man over there can handle it,\u201d I said, my cheek against his back. \u201cAnd who will protect me, if you\u2019re in jail? Would it be worth it, if something happened to me while you were gone?\u201d I felt horrible saying it, and I knew it wasn\u2019t even a sound argument, but I was desperate to get him to walk away, and I thought it would at least get his attention. Some scandalous pictures of me were not my biggest concern.</p><p>He shuddered, and I felt a rush of relief. He turned into me, still using his body to block me from view, and ushered me back into the garage.</p><p>\u201cGet those fucking pictures off of his camera, Stimpson, or it\u2019s your fucking job!\u201d James barked over his shoulder, not slowing.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck were you thinking?\u201d James burst out the second he\u2019d shut the door from the garage into my kitchen. \u201cDo you like giving the world a fucking show?\u201d</p><p>I stiffened at his words, raised nearly to a rage-filled shout. I didn\u2019t respond, raising my chin and walking woodenly through my house and into my bathroom.</p><p>If he was going to take his anger out on me in a way I couldn\u2019t handle, I supposed it was better that I find out sooner rather than later. I tried to stay calm, but my whole body was shaking as I waited to see what he\u2019d do next.</p><p>I tossed off my scanty clothes before stepping into the shower, turning it on, the cold spray hitting me for several seconds before it began to warm.</p><p>I just stood under the spray, unmoving, for several minutes. It was a long time before James joined me.</p> <p>I felt him more than saw him, since my eyes were closed.</p><p>He hugged me very carefully from behind. My first instinct was to pull away, but I let him hold me. I could feel him trembling, and the thought of hurting him, when he was as vulnerable as I, was abhorrent to me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, love. Of course you were just taking out your trash, like a normal person. I shouldn\u2019t have taken my anger out on you. I\u2019m sorry I raised my voice. I would never put my hands on you in anger. Whatever demons I may have, I don\u2019t have that in me. But I saw that scared look on your face when I raised my voice. I hate myself for putting it there.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t say anything, but I didn\u2019t push him away, either.</p><p>He washed me, his touch gentle. \u201cWill you come to the hotel with me today? You can do a spa day while I get a few things done.\u201d As he spoke, he lathered my hair.</p><p>I sighed, feeling weak from the morning\u2019s drama.</p><p>Why not do a spa day? I asked myself, seriously considering the idea. I never got to do things like that.</p><p>I didn\u2019t have to work until evening, and James would spend ridiculous amounts of money on me, spa day or not. It was really a drop in the bucket at this point.</p><p>\u201cYou can invite anyone you want. They\u2019ll give you the royal treatment, as well as any of your friends.</p><p>Just invite Stephan, and tell him to get the word out. You could have a flight attendant reunion at the spa, if you want. My resort has one of the best in town.\u201d</p><p>I caved at the plea in his voice. He was like a child, grasping for a way to make amends.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I finally said. I sounded like a brat to my own ears. \u201cThank you, James. That\u2019s considerate.</p><p>You\u2019re considerate.\u201d</p><p>Wet lips kissed my cheek almost sloppily. It was so unlike him that I let out a little giggle.</p><p>\u201cThank you. Nothing makes me happier than taking care of you, in any way that I can.\u201d His voice was a raw whisper against my skin.</p><p>I turned and hugged him, his vulnerability almost palpable to me at that moment.</p><p>\u201cYou make me so happy, Bianca. I was just angry with myself, that I\u2019d failed to protect you, yet again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, James. What am I going to do with you? A few stupid pictures aren\u2019t going to hurt me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I heard the garage door opening, my heart stopped. Just the thought of you being outside by yourself, when your father is still on the loose, makes me panicky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI obviously wasn\u2019t alone, with that bodyguard out there. Seems to me like you had your bases covered.\u201d</p><p>He stiffened up at that. \u201cWhat took him so fucking long to react? That\u2019s what I want to know.\u201d</p><p>I kissed the center of his chest, right in that little indent between his well muscled pectorals. I loved that spot.</p><p>I filled my palm with shampoo, reaching up high to lather his honey-colored hair. I smiled at him as the motion dragged my chest against his. He bent down to give me better access, leaning his forehead onto my shoulder. I washed him as he had washed me. It was the first time he\u2019d allowed me to tend to him as tenderly as he so often did to me. \u201cDo you mind me touching you like this? Is that why you avoid letting me do this to you, usually?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, his eyes closed. His voice was a rasp in my ear. \u201cNot you. I love any touch from you. It feels caring, and I want that. I want so much for you to care for me.\u201d</p><p>My heart hurt a little at his words. I wanted to reassure him, but the words were a lump in my throat.</p><p>He just hugged me tightly, not pressing me for the words. If he had wanted a woman who could express her feelings easily, I supposed he wouldn\u2019t have chosen me.</p><p>\u201cMove in with me.\u201d His words were quiet but heartfelt.</p><p>I sighed. He was an undeniable force. A few short days, and it was nearly impossible to tell him no.</p><p>\u201cHow about this? We\u2019ll spend more time together. If we\u2019re in the same city, we\u2019ll have sleepovers, just like we\u2019ve done the last few days.\u201d</p><p>He just about squeezed the breath out of me. \u201cThank you,\u201d he rasped, and began to kiss me. His hands were everywhere, his mouth hot, as he backed me against the shower wall. When he felt my hot center and found it wet, he lifted me against him, impaling me brutally.</p><p>\u201cTell me if you\u2019re sore,\u201d he said roughly.</p><p>He leaned my back against the tiled wall and began to thrust.</p><p>I was sore, deliciously sore, but I wouldn\u2019t have told him so for anything. Then he might have stopped the heavenly orgasm that built as he pounded into me. I watched his lovely face, as he had taught me, as he moved, my hands grasping his shoulders. His face was wet, his golden skin so perfect. I thought he looked like an angel, with his wet hair trailing into his face.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful,\u201d I told him quietly, but he still heard me over the spray.</p><p>He clearly enjoyed my admiration, his body shuddering in preparation for his climax. I felt him shuddering down to my toes, and it tipped me over the edge.</p><p>I cupped his cheek as we came together. It was so intimate that it should have made me cold, or uncomfortable, or even repulsed, but it didn\u2019t. More and more, I was craving this intimacy, not running from it.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY</p><p>After we\u2019d showered and dressed, I found my phone, intending to text Stephan about the spa day.</p><p>James held up a hand. \u201cLet me talk to him.\u201d</p><p>I wrinkled my nose. He tapped it.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you need to tell him?\u201d I asked, suspicious.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I dropped it, seeing by his innocent expression that I would have better luck asking Stephan what James was texting him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to cook some eggs for breakfast, unless you object,\u201d I told him, pulling on an old sundress. I figured I\u2019d get dressed for real after we ate. I didn\u2019t even bother with underwear.</p><p>He gave me a heated kiss. He tasted unbelievably good. He always did. I sucked at his hot mouth, and he groaned, pulling away. He smiled and slapped my ass.</p><p>I beat a hasty retreat. At this rate, we would fuck each other until we starved to death.</p><p>I was walking to the kitchen, phone still clutched in my hand, when it began to ring. I glanced at the face. I recognized the number, since I\u2019d missed several calls from the same 702 number over the past month.</p><p>Impulsively I answered. I didn\u2019t like mysteries, and I wanted to know who kept calling me so persistently.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d I said into the phone.</p><p>There was no response on the other end, just silence with the faintest hint of soft music in the background. Three heartbeats later the phone disconnected from the other end.</p><p>My brow was furrowed as I set my phone on the counter and began to cook breakfast. The calls were strange, but hardly something to let myself be bothered about. I resolved not to let myself dwell on them.</p><p>I made a huge portion of eggs and whatever else I could find that went with them. Peppers, onions, ham, smoked turkey, with some extra sharp cheddar to top it off. It was a better breakfast then I\u2019d thought I could come up with, so I was rather pleased with the effort.</p><p>James ate a ridiculous amount of it. His plate had to be filled with at least five eggs worth, but he cleared it in short order. He ate it as though he\u2019d never had such fine food in his life, when the reality was, it was just what I could scrounge up, since I was often out of town. Still, I appreciated his enthusiasm.</p><p>I shouldn\u2019t have been surprised to find new additions to my closet, both for me and for James. It was stuffed full, whereas before it had been rather sparse. I sent him an arch look as I noticed the change. He didn\u2019t even seem to notice, looking through my new clothes. He pulled a pair of tiny white cargo shorts off of a hanger, handing them to me. They were shorter than anything I owned. He picked out a little gold tank top with geometric designs printed across it in black and white. He handed it to me without a word. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I raised my brows at his arbitrary choices, but I put them on without a protest. I could at least see how they fit, and how they looked.</p><p>The shorts were very short, but stretchier than they looked, and oddly comfortable. I hadn\u2019t ever owned a pair of white shorts that I could remember. I checked my panty line carefully, a little worried that my pink thong would show through, but the material seemed solid enough. The top was comfortable, hanging rather loosely to my hips. I decided I liked James\u2019s choices as I studied the outfit in the mirror. It was flattering but tasteful. Well, as tasteful as short shorts could be.</p><p>I was nearly done with my easy hair and minimal makeup by the time James emerged from the closet, dressed and looking fabulous, as always. His attire was different than any I\u2019d seen him wear before. He wore white linen shorts that clung to his hips deliciously. My eyes lingered there the longest. He wore a loose, brilliant blue dress shirt, sleeves rolled up and open at the collar. The color set off his eyes and his tan to perfection.</p><p>I was surprised that he was dressed down. I didn\u2019t imagine that anyone at his resort had ever seen him in anything but a three-piece suit. He looked like he was about to go on vacation in the Hamptons, not spend a few hours working.</p> <p>\u201cThat looks nice,\u201d I told him as he approached my vanity, hovering behind me. \u201cI\u2019m surprised to see you in anything but a suit, though, for the hotel.\u201d</p><p>He just shrugged, studying me with that razor focus of his. He reached past me, digging into the silver box of jewelry that had followed us from Wyoming. I\u2019d taken off my collar before showering, and he clasped it back around my neck without a word. I fingered it as he reached back into the box, pulling out a pair of huge, princess cut diamond earrings I\u2019d never seen before. He put them on me without a word, pressing against my back intimately.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all too much, James,\u201d I said, but didn\u2019t take them off. He seemed to need to do this, to shower me in gifts. I should have put up more of a fight, I knew, but his warm gaze stopped me. It pleased him to do this, and it killed any urge I had to stop him when I realized just how much it pleased him.</p><p>He reached into the large jewelry box again, pulling out a good-sized black jewelry box. I pursed my lips, knowing he had done yet another outrageous thing.</p><p>He opened the box, showing me matching diamond cuffs. The were thick, twinkling with more tiny diamonds than I could even guess at. It didn\u2019t escape me that they looked like jewel encrusted shackles.</p> <p>He studied my wrists, running a light finger over the abrasions still visible there. \u201cThese will have to wait a few days, I think.\u201d He snapped the case closed, putting it back.</p><p>He pressed a palm flat against my stomach, pressing me harder against him. His other hand snaked down to my inner thighs, pressing past my scanty shorts and panties. It was shocking how fast and easily he could access me there.</p><p>I sucked in a breath as he worked a long finger into me. I sought out his hot gaze in the mirror.</p><p>He watched his hand as though transfixed. \u201cMy dresser is getting you more shorts like this. Not only do your legs look phenomenal, I can also do this anytime I please. Gotta love that kind of access.\u201d</p><p>Regrettably, he extricated his finger rather quickly, kissing the back of my head. He sighed heavily before moving away. He went back into my closet, returning with two pairs of shoes that I hadn\u2019t put in there. He slipped on a pair of white loafers that set his golden skin off to perfection, handing a pair of bright blue wedge heels to me. I saw immediately that they matched his shirt.</p><p>In spite of myself, I smiled.</p> <p>\u201cIt seems you know the contents of my closet better than I do nowadays, Mr. Cavendish.\u201d My tone was arch as I bent down to fasten the heels onto my feet. They were comfortable for three and a half inch heels, I had to admit.</p><p>He didn\u2019t respond, just smirked, waiting for me.</p><p>\u201cHow did you get so much stuff into my house without my noticing?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He pursed his lips, taking my arm and leading me out of the bedroom, making a beeline for the front door. \u201cStephan let my dresser in. When will I be getting my own set of keys?\u201d</p><p>I stiffened. It didn\u2019t escape me that he had somehow turned the conversation around on me. \u201cWhy would you need them?\u201d</p><p>He sighed, aiming a hooded look at me as we walked out the front door. I didn\u2019t even question that we would take his car. I couldn\u2019t picture him in my own small car.</p><p>A new, creepy photographer had taken up residence on my sidewalk. However, he wasn\u2019t snapping pictures when we walked out. He was far too occupied arguing with an intimidating Clark. Clark shifted in front of the man, blocking us from his view as soon as we were spotted. I couldn\u2019t imagine the man got any clear pictures of us as James ushered me swiftly into the car. Clark didn\u2019t get out of the man\u2019s face until we were safely ensconced.</p><p>\u201cVery good, Clark,\u201d James said as Clark slid into his seat.</p> <p>Clark nodded and began to drive. \u201cI fired Stimpson, Sir. I\u2019m very sorry about what happened this morning. I thought he was more reliable, or he never would have gotten the job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d James said, clutching my hand tightly. \u201cWas he at least successful at retrieving all of the pictures taken?\u201d</p><p>Clark\u2019s voice was quietly furious when he answered. \u201cHe claims he did, but it\u2019s impossible to say. I only have his account of events.\u201d</p><p>James\u2019s grip tightened almost painfully. \u201cI should have handled it myself,\u201d James said darkly.</p><p>He closed the privacy screen after that, brooding quietly for most of the drive. It wasn\u2019t until we were nearly at the hotel that he spoke. The impressive resort was visible from far away. I watched it as we drew closer and closer.</p><p>\u201cHave you been to the property before?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I remembered all of the buzz when it first re-opened two or three years ago. It was one of the swankier casinos on the strip, with five star restaurants and a nightclub hotspot that was quite famous, and I had heard a lot of people mention the large shopping mall attached to it. But I rarely went on the strip, and when I did, it was usually to meet with friends, and never at the more overpriced hotel/casinos.</p><p>He kissed my hand. \u201cI\u2019ll have to show you around on the way to the spa. Stephan said he\u2019d meet you there. It sounds like he got quite a few friends to come, considering that it was such short notice.\u201d</p><p>I smiled, thinking of Stephan\u2019s reaction to a spa day. It sooo wasn\u2019t his thing. \u201cDid he gripe about the spa?\u201d</p><p>James grinned. \u201cHe did. But I told him you missed him, and it was enough. Has he never done a spa day before?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, laughing. \u201cNeither of us have. That sort of thing is ungodly expensive.\u201d</p><p>We pulled up to the huge entrance that read Cavendish Hotel&amp;Casino as he spoke. \u201cWell, you\u2019ll be getting the royal treatment today, I can assure you. And you can go every day of the week, if you want to.</p><p>I will inform the staff that you have carte blanche status.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t bother to protest. I knew I wouldn\u2019t be making much use of that extravagance. I felt spoiled enough just going today.</p><p>He led me through the shopping mall first, as that was where we had entered. He wrapped a possessive arm around the back of my waist, his hand gripping my hip warmly. I put my hand over his as he ushered me around, giving me a short but thorough tour of the shops. He introduced me to several managers throughout the mall, but I knew I wouldn\u2019t remember hardly any of their names.</p><p>Only the female owner of the casino\u2019s famous tattoo shop stood out. She had dark hair streaked with blue and a pouty red mouth, every inch of her exposed skin covered in ink. And she had a lot of of exposed skin. She wore a half shirt and cut-off jean shorts that were so short they made mine look overly modest.</p><p>She smiled at me warmly, but I stiffened immediately at the sight of her. I had seen her and James photographed together in several pictures online. It was rumored that they\u2019d had a steamy affair. There was a reality TV series filmed at her shop, I suddenly recalled reading. Her name was Frankie, and I tried not to be openly rude to her, but it was a struggle.</p><p>James embraced the woman, showing an easy affection with her that made my vision go a little red and hazy. He introduced me simply by name, not giving me a title or explaining our relationship. We moved on quickly.</p><p>I was tense and stiff after that meeting. I knew it was unreasonable to be jealous and moody after that, but I still couldn\u2019t shake it. James led me through the shopping mall and the restaurants, through the expansive casino, and lastly, through the hotel portion and into the spa.</p><p>I was happy to see my group of friends as James led me into the swanky waiting lounge that led to the salon and spa.</p><p>It was an impressive group on such short notice. But then again, who would turn down a free spa day?</p><p>Stephan was waiting in the luxurious waiting area, flanked by a laughing group that consisted mostly of girls. The only exception sat rather close beside him. Javier looked happier than I\u2019d ever seen him as he laughed at something Stephan had said.</p><p>Marnie, Judith, Brenda, and Jessa flanked the cute couple, chattering excitedly.</p><p>Marnie and Judith jumped up, squealing in delight when they spotted James and I. They hugged me, thanking James as they did so, talking over each other and giggling all the while.</p><p>I glanced at James. He smiled indulgently, waving at Stephan, who waved back with a nod, as though answering a silent question. The two men in my life seemed to be developing their own language of sorts. Perversely, I found that fact both heartwarming and disconcerting.</p><p>James addressed the group. \u201cPlease, everyone, enjoy yourselves. Don\u2019t hesitate to avail yourselves of any of the spa and salon services that you wish to. It\u2019s my treat, of course.\u201d</p><p>He just smiled and nodded when all six of them thanked him at nearly the same time.</p><p>He turned to me, leaning down to kiss me softly on the cheek. \u201cI\u2019ll miss you, Love. Take your time. I\u2019ll be awhile. If you need to get ahold of me, call my cel,\u201d he whispered the words into my ear softly, then departed.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE</p><p>No one even bothered to wait for James to get out of earshot before they started talking about him.</p><p>Everyone seemed to be in agreement. James was dreamy, and sweet, and fabulous in every way imaginable. I took all of their dreamy gushing and goodnatured advice with a wry smile.</p><p>Stephan rose and kissed my cheek, smiling. \u201cYou\u2019re glowing. Things going well?\u201d he asked, his voice pitched low, but I still heard him over the loud women, who were still extolling James\u2019s obvious charms.</p><p>I just nodded.</p><p>\u201cAre you glad that you finally agreed to see him?\u201d he asked, his voice almost chiding.</p><p>I shot him a look, but knew he had a point.</p><p>A spa hostess approached me, looking harried. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Ms. Karlsson. We are ready for you now. I apologize for the wait. Which service would your party like to begin with.\u201d</p><p>I just blinked at her for a long moment. I didn\u2019t even know what services there were, and I hadn\u2019t even been waiting for more than maybe five minutes, tops.</p><p>I looked to my group for help. \u201cWhat first?\u201d I asked them. I figured someone there had to have a preference. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Judith didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cThe deluxe package how it\u2019s listed should be perfect. Massage first, I think.\u201d</p><p>The hostess nodded, looking relieved. \u201cYes, right this way.\u201d She led us into another waiting area. It was even more posh than the first one, with stone walls and opaque glass throughout. There was a tea bar, but before we could serve ourselves, the hostess introduced us to our own personalized attendants.</p><p>Mine was a delicately petite asian girl named Mina.</p><p>She seemed anxious and nervous as she asked me what I would like to drink. \u201cI can get you literally anything, Ms. Karlsson. Please don\u2019t hesitate to ask.\u201d</p> <p>It was an intimidating request. I would rather have just had a menu. \u201cTea, please.\u201d</p><p>She named off ten different teas that the spa boasted. \u201cI\u2019ll take the youthberry oolong infused with lemongrass. Plain, thank you,\u201d I told her.</p><p>She seemed relieved, as though she\u2019d been worried I would request something more complicated. She brought a tea service tray to the table in front of me, and prepared my tea as though it were a ritual. I thought it was charming. I told her so.</p><p>She looked up, beaming at me. \u201cI trained in Japan, when I was little. You should see my mother. Her tea service puts mine to shame.\u201d</p><p>She finally poured the impressively prepared cup of tea, then left briefly, returning with trays of food.</p> <p>There was fruit, vegetables, tiny sandwiches, hors d\u2019oeuvres, and cheese and crackers. She brought tray after tray, and I took little samples from each.</p><p>All of my friends were getting the same treatment in comfortable seats around the stone lined room. It was almost like being inside of a luxurious cave, I mused.</p><p>I heard Judith telling the room at large that the cucumber sandwiches were divine. I ate the one I had grabbed. It was pretty tasty, I had to admit. And the tea was to die for, smooth without a hint of bitter.</p><p>Mina brought a tray of tiny muffins, truffles, and fruit tarts. I took one of the fruit tarts, thanking her. I ate lightly, sampling more than eating. I had a nervous stomach, since I didn\u2019t know what to expect from the spa day, and surprises made me nervous. I was even bad at relaxing at a spa. The thought was somewhat disheartening.</p><p>After we had snacked and drank, we were escorted into a large massage room. It was another modern cavelike design, with frosted glass obscuring us from each other for the massage. We could talk, but we didn\u2019t have to all get naked together. I was relieved.</p><p>Mina explained to me how I should prepare for the massage, then left me to it. I undressed, putting my clothes into the large locker provided in my massage nook. It felt wrong to take my jewelry off in public, and leave it in a locker, but I did it, not knowing exactly what we were in store for. I got quickly under the white sheet in only my thong, as Mina had instructed, lying on my stomach.</p> <p>I saw white shoes approaching me from the hole in the table my face fit into.</p><p>\u201cMs. Karlsson, I\u2019m Jen, I\u2019ll be massaging you today,\u201d a very soothing voice told me.</p><p>Jen went through all of the techniques she offered, and I requested the deep tissue. She set to work immediately. She was good. I\u2019d never had a massage like that before, never had a professional of any kind, and it felt divine. Everyone must have been having a similar experience, because shortly after the service began, no one said a word, not even Marnie or Judith, who were notorious for never being able to shut up. There were some appreciative groans heard throughout the hour, but that was all.</p><p>We all wore matching plush terrycloth robes as we followed our respective spa attendants to the next service. We used separate rooms for that one. The facial also lasted an hour, and my face felt clean and fresh when it was finished.</p><p>All of the girls met up in a modern, stone-walled room that housed a collection of pools designed to look like a modern twist on a natural hot-spring. Stephan and Javier had to go to a separate pool, since the pools were not co-ed, though we were the only occupants of this one.</p><p>We soaked for a long time, and I mostly listened to the chatter with a half-smile.</p><p>\u201cHow cute are Javier and Stephan together?\u201d Judith was asking the room.</p><p>I silently agreed. It wasn\u2019t just that they were good-looking. The way they looked at each other, even casually, was good for my soul. I wanted so badly for them to work, I was almost afraid to hope for it.</p> <p>\u201cDo you approve, Bianca? Does Javier get your stamp of approval?\u201d Marnie was asking me, snapping me out of my musings.</p><p>I wondered why everyone thought that I was Stephan\u2019s keeper. The idea was bizarre to me. I would never tell him who to date. From my point of view, I always just wanted his dates to like me, and not mind me being around a lot, since that was usually how it went. \u201cTo be honest, anyone that Stephan wants gets my stamp of approval. I just want him to be happy.\u201d</p><p>For some reason, that got soft \u2018ahs\u2019 all around. Then the topic moved to how cute Stephan and I were.</p><p>\u201cYou guys are related somehow, right?\u201d Brenda asked. She was the one in the group that had known us the shortest amount of time. \u201cStephan told me you were family.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cNot by blood, but in every way that counts. He\u2019s like a brother, and my best friend. If that\u2019s not family, I don\u2019t have a clue what is.\u201d</p><p>Another round of \u2018ahs\u2019 made me smile. The talk soon turned to James, of course.</p><p>\u201cIs it serious, Bianca? It seems really serious.\u201d This came from Judith, who had no qualms about prying.</p><p>I had a hard time with girl talk, with opening up in general, but I wanted to try. \u201cI don\u2019t know. It feels that way, but it\u2019s still so new.\u201d I took a deep breath, continuing. \u201cHe wants me to move in with him.\u201d I was surprised at myself for revealing that, but I wanted their opinions.</p><p>Every single one of them gasped, hands flying to their chests. It was comical.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d Jessa asked. She was the first one to recover, from the looks of the other ones.</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cI told him we needed to spend more time together before I could consider something like that. He\u2019s not easily deterred, though. He had a stylist, or dresser or whatever you call them, buy me a wardrobe for each of his houses, so he already has me kind of moved in, even though I never agreed to it.\u201d</p><p>More comical gasping and some stuttering at that one.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s crazy, right?\u201d I asked, hoping to hear a sensible opinion.</p><p>I didn\u2019t get one. Even sensible Brenda thought he was romantic, and hopelessly in love with me.</p><p>I didn\u2019t tell them that he\u2019d never said he loved me. It will hurt to say it out loud, I thought.</p><p>\u201cYou guys would have supermodel babies,\u201d Judith said on a sigh, in fantasyland.</p><p>Jessa was watching me closely, and seemed to see something on my face at Judith\u2019s words. \u201cOh, my, god, have you guys talked about having kids?\u201d</p><p>I grimaced. \u201cHe mentioned it briefly. He dropped the issue when he saw that it made me want to run screaming. It\u2019s all way too fast, right? It\u2019s crazy to move so fast in a relationship, right?\u201d I asked, again looking for a voice of sanity.</p><p>\u201cMartin said he knew he was going to marry me on our very first date. He said he just knew, like something in his mind clicked. He said I was the missing piece in his life\u2019s puzzle. He pursued me until I saw it, too. And that was twenty years and two kids ago, so it worked out for us.\u201d Brenda smiled as her story got \u2018ahs\u2019 around the room.</p><p>Okay, even I could admit that story was pretty sweet.</p><p>\u201cJames strikes me as a man who knows what he wants,\u201d Brenda continued. \u201cI don\u2019t see him changing his mind, either, not with the way he looks at you.\u201d</p><p>Okay, I am not going to get any sobering advice from this crowd, I decided.</p><p>Next we moved on to manicures and pedicures, the guys joining us again. They weren\u2019t a cute couple, I decided, watching them. They were beautiful, Stephan so muscular and golden, Javier so, well, pretty, and elegantly built.</p><p>\u201cMe and Marnie are official losing it, guys,\u201d Judith told us all.</p><p>\u201cDid we ever even have it?\u201d Marnie asked her, mock despair in her voice.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Jessa asked, laughing at the outrageous women. They were like a comedy duo, playing off of each other for an entertaining routine.</p><p>\u201cWe tried to get a guy to do a three-way with us, and he turned us down! \u201d Judith\u2019s voice was bewildered.</p><p>I giggled a little. The unexpected turn of conversation had surprised it out of me.</p><p>\u201cCaptain Damien?\u201d Stephan asked them sympathetically, but he couldn\u2019t quite hold back his smile.</p><p>Marnie and Judith were in pedicure chairs next to each other, and they nodded at the same time, as though in sync.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t take it personal, girls, he\u2019s hopelessly in love with Bianca,\u201d Javier said, his first words in a while.</p><p>Stephan gave him a look, and Javier winced at me sympathetically.</p><p>My face flushed. I hoped he was joking, or at least mistaken.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not fair!\u201d Judith told me. \u201cYou have Mr. Beautiful. Give us Damien!\u201d</p><p>I wrinkled my nose. \u201cDamien is just a friend. He\u2019s not in love with me.\u201d My voice was almost apologetic. I looked to Stephan for support. \u201cYou talk to him all the time, Stephan. Tell them he\u2019s not into me.\u201d</p><p>Stephan grimaced. \u201cI\u2019ve told him, over and over again, that you\u2019re not interested in him like that, but he at least has a very enduring crush.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean by enduring?\u201d I asked him, my eyes narrowed on him.</p><p>\u201cTwo years or so. And he stopped dating, and hooking up, at least six months ago, so that you would take him serious when he asked you out again. He thought that the fact that he\u2019s a slut is what was keeping you from seeing him as more than a friend.\u201d</p><p>I was shocked. All of this had been going on without my knowledge, and Stephan decided to tell me about it when we were getting our feet worked on by strangers, and in front of five of our friends. I gave him my best \u2018WTF\u2019 look.</p><p>It grew real quiet after that, the others sensing the sudden tension between Stephan and I. It was a good ten minutes before they all started chatting again, but I stayed silent, brooding.</p><p>I didn\u2019t understand why Stephan had kept it from me, but I supposed it was an awkward thing to bring up, when he\u2019d known how I clearly felt.</p><p>Stephan sat next to me when we got the manicures. He looked pretty cute, a big muscular guy in a soft robe, getting his nails done. I was smarter than to point it out, though.</p><p>He gave me a searching look. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. That came out at a bad time, but when you asked so directly, I couldn\u2019t deny it. That was just the first time it came up, yanno?\u201d</p><p>I could see his position, and I nodded. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s just awkward. But it\u2019s awkward for you, as well. I just don\u2019t understand what I could have done to give Damien the wrong idea. It makes no sense.\u201d</p><p>Stephan flushed a little, and I studied him, fascinated. \u201cFrom what I\u2019ve gleaned, your disinterest is just more of a turn on for him. I think he likes unreadable, mysterious women, and you\u2019re the ultimate when it comes to that. The problem is, it\u2019s because you genuinely aren\u2019t interested in him. But that just doesn\u2019t seem to faze him. He thinks he just needs to wait out your relationship with James, and that you\u2019ll come around eventually.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I sighed. \u201cWell, what a waste of hi s time. I wish someone could talk some sense into him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelieve me, Buttercup, I have tried.\u201d</p><p>We were escorted back to the refreshment waiting area. Mina offered me more snacks and drinks. I took more tea, trying jasmine oolong that time.</p><p>We changed back into our street clothes before being ushered into the salon portion of the spa. I took very careful inventory of my jewelry as I put it back on.</p> <p>I went for the full hair treatment as well, needing a trim. My hairdresser was pleasant and friendly. She immediately started trying to talk me into some highlights.</p><p>Mina interrupted her, her tone apologetic. \u201cMr. Cavendish left instructions not to color her hair,\u201d she explained, then moved away.</p><p>The hairdresser looked nonplussed. She seemed to shake herself out of it. I almost wanted to tell her to give me the highlights, anyways. Who cared? It was just hair. But I would feel terrible if it somehow got her in trouble, so I left it alone. James was her boss, after all.</p><p>She indicated a spot on my forehead. \u201cWhat about short, straight bangs for you? It would set off your eyes, and your hair is straight enough to pull off the style that\u2019s really hot right now.\u201d</p><p>I gave a little shrug. \u201cDo whatever you think would look flattering. My hair only ever stays straight just like this, so keep that in mind. I usually just trim it, and keep it like this. I wouldn\u2019t mind a change, as long as it doesn\u2019t require a long time to style.\u201d</p> <p>She nodded decisively, seeming to know just what she wanted to do. I closed my eyes and let her work.</p><p>I was rather pleased with the finished product, despite my apathy. It was flattering, and it did bring out my eyes, the short bangs making them seem bigger in my face.</p><p>Everyone seemed to agree, and I flushed a little at all of the compliments thrown at me.</p><p>We got our cosmetics done next. The woman who did my makeup tried to instruct me as she did so, handing me a large bag of cosmetics when she finished. I liked what she had done, the effects subtle but flattering, the smoky eye not too heavy on my pale face, as I would have thought. I thought it went particularly well with my new haircut.</p><p>We were ushered back to the tea room again to finish up, the hostess asking me if they could provide any other services.</p><p>I checked the time on my phone, surprised to see that it was nearly time for us to start heading home to prepare for work that night.</p> <p>\u201cNo, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you were satisfied with our services, Ms. Karlsson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery much so. We had a great time. Thank you.\u201d As I spoke, James walked into the room, as though he had timed the entire thing down to the minute.</p><p>He grinned wide when he saw me, looking happy and...mischievous. I knew instantly that he had done or was planning to do something outrageous.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you planning?\u201d I asked him as soon as he was within earshot.</p><p>His grin just widened, and I got a little worried.</p><p>He glanced around at everyone, smiling warmly. \u201cHow was it?\u201d</p><p>He got flooded with enthusiastic answers, all positive, of course. Who could complain about a free spa day? He seemed pleased, though, that everyone had enjoyed themselves.</p> <p>\u201cI got you something,\u201d James told me, that happy smile never leaving his face. He was positively beaming.</p><p>I bit my lip, tilting my head back to look up at him. I was scared to ask. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d I asked, not even trying to hide my worry.</p><p>He laughed. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I can do it justice by explaining it. I\u2019ll have to show you. And your friends, too, I think. I did promise.\u201d</p><p>I was perplexed when he started to unbutton his shirt, still grinning, his eyes glued to mine.</p><p>\u201cWhat on earth are you doing?\u201d I asked him.</p><p>Someone, I thought it was Judith, hooted in encouragement.</p><p>Was he giving me a striptease? I wondered, genuinely confounded. And unwillingly turned on.</p><p>I gasped, my heart stopping when I saw the blood red letters inked on his perfect chest. Right over his heart, I thought. He had marred his perfect skin for me. I felt tears prick my eyes.</p><p>The room around us went straight into chaos mode, Marnie and Judith shamelessly screaming and jumping around like maniacs.</p><p>I heard a disgruntled, \u201cWhat the fuck, man?\u201d from Stephan.</p><p>I took deep breaths, my eyes glued to the Bianca written in small letters cleanly over his heart.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fake, right?\u201d I asked him. \u201cIt\u2019s a joke, right?\u201d</p><p>His smile didn\u2019t falter as he wiped a horrifying tear from my cheek. \u201cWhy the tears?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour perfect skin. You shouldn\u2019t have marked it for my sake. You have the finest skin on earth. It seems like a shame,\u201d I told him, my voice whisper soft.</p><p>That surprised a laugh out of him. \u201cYou\u2019ll get used to it. I think you\u2019ll like the other one better,\u201d he told me.</p><p>\u201cPlease, tell me the other one is on your dick!\u201d</p><p>I sent Judith a stern look for that one. She just dissolved into helpless giggles.</p><p>James bit the bottom lip of his pretty mouth, turning to show me his back.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO</p><p>The tattoo was etched directly over the clean slab of his right shoulder blade. And, like the man himself, it was exquisite.</p><p>I stood, brushing close to him to study it intently. Tears ran liberally down my cheeks, embarrassing but irrepressible.</p><p>It was a portrait of my face, my hair flowing out to shape into lilies that formed a perfect frame, as though it were a painting. He had taken one of my self-portraits and etched it permanently into his skin. It was the sweetest, craziest, most romantic thing I\u2019d ever witnessed, and I didn\u2019t know what to make of it. I loved the tattoo on sight, though, loved having my painting turned into something so wonderful. Even the lilies used to frame the portrait had been copied from my work, I recognized. I was suddenly glad that I had spent so much time on the paintings he\u2019d used, trying to get all of the details just so.</p><p>James was shooting me expectant looks over his shoulder, his face as happy and carefree as I\u2019d ever seen it. \u201cWell, what do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, James,\u201d I said, my voice catching. \u201cIt\u2019s exquisite. It\u2019s more colorful than any tattoo I\u2019ve ever seen. I\u2019ve never seen one that looks like this. It\u2019s more like a painting than a tattoo. Why does it look so different?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t use any black ink for outlining. I used lighter colors for that. And with James\u2019s dark skin, I was able to use white ink for the skin color, which gave it a very painting kind of feel. He\u2019s one of the best canvases I\u2019ve had the pleasure of working on. I\u2019ll have to thank you for helping me finally get my hands on him. Obviously, you inspired his sudden interest in ink.\u201d I hadn\u2019t seen her approaching until she spoke, but the tattoo artist, Frankie, was suddenly beside me, pointing out details of the tattoo on his back, standing nearly as close to him as I was. I stiffened.</p><p>I knew it was illogical, and unreasonable, but realizing that another woman had done the tattoo, one he was obviously fond of, made me a little crazy. That red haze I was beginning to recognize as jealousy was now a pernicious film over my vision.</p><p>\u201cCan I cover it now, James? Have you finished the show and tell?\u201d Frankie asked him, sounding sassy but playful, her smile very warm on him.</p><p>He grinned at her, still looking over his shoulder, letting me look my fill.</p><p>I still studied the incredible portrait. I wanted to run my fingers over it, but even with my limited knowledge on the subject, I knew it was too new for touching. My hand gripped the top of his shoulder instead, as I leaned in very close and studied it intently, trying to ignore the woman standing too close, and too familiarly, beside James and I.</p><p>I was smiling in the picture, a slight, sort of enigmatic smile, my eyes heavy-lidded and mysterious. She had even matched the blue of my eyes astonishingly well. She was very talented, I had to admit. I had never even known a tattoo could look like that. Most of my friends had one or two, but they were usually outlined in heavy black, or else entirely black. What Frankie had done looked so much softer than that. It was hard to even think of James\u2019s marking as the same thing.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful. You\u2019re very talented. I didn\u2019t even know that a tattoo could look like that,\u201d I told Frankie, trying to be civil, but my voice was stiff and a little cold.</p><p>James seemed to notice my tone, his eyes flying back to my face, studying me intently, his happy smile wilting a little, his eyes becoming solemn.</p><p>I felt instantly contrite. Just the wrong tone of voice, and his ridiculously happy mood seemed to have been subdued.</p><p>I tried to give him a smile, but I could feel that it looked forced. \u201cI\u2019m finished looking at it, if she needs to tend to it,\u201d I told him, stepping back from him.</p><p>Frankie stepped in instantly, rubbing a clear gel over the entire inked surface. I watched her hands on him, and felt the strangest urge to move between them.</p><p>I moved away, turning my back to them.</p><p>Frankie\u2019s voice was still friendly as she addressed me. \u201cYou\u2019re very talented. I just did my best to do your picture justice. It was a real treat for me to get to work on a picture like that, on a body like James\u2019s. Talk about a work of art.\u201d Her voice turned over the top flirtatious on the last sentence, and I knew she was talking about his body.</p><p>I counted to ten, hating myself for being so weak and so insanely jealous.</p><p>I heard Frankie giving James care instructions briefly.</p><p>\u201cSo, um, nice meeting you, Bianca. I\u2019ll see ya around,\u201d Frankie said, her voice still friendly, but a bit uncertain.</p><p>A brief glance at my group of friends showed most of them looking at me, wide-eyed, as though they weren\u2019t sure what to make of my behavior. I couldn\u2019t blame them. I felt ridiculous, but I still couldn\u2019t look at James, worried that if Frankie was still near him, I would do something completely insane.</p><p>Stephan was the only one of the group who seemed oblivious to my strange reaction, his intent glare focused narrowly on James.</p><p>I just tensed up more when James hugged me from behind.</p><p>\u201cWe need a minute, guys. Thank you all for coming on such short notice,\u201d James addressed the group, politely but briskly, his tone a courteous dismissal. He gripped the back of my neck, in that dominant spot, leading me into a room.</p><p>I recognized the room immediately. It was the faux hot springs room. One of the attendants followed us in. \u201cMay I help you with anything, Mr. Cavendish?\u201d she asked, her voice nervous.</p><p>\u201cYes. Please make sure we\u2019re not disturbed until we\u2019ve finished in here.\u201d</p><p>They were at my back as they spoke, and I looked resolutely at the low pools, a hot blush coloring my face. I knew what would be assumed, of course. I didn\u2019t even know myself what James had planned.</p><p>\u201cOf course, Sir. Please let me know if I can further assist you.\u201d</p><p>I heard the door shut just as she finished speaking. The sound of the door clicking closed echoed in the huge room.</p><p>James was silent for a long moment, his hand heavy on my neck.</p><p>\u201cYou seem tense,\u201d James told me in a sort of offhanded way, his voice almost disinterested. He removed his hand, and I heard clothes rustling behind me. I held me breath, trying intently to hear what he was doing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTake off your clothes, Bianca,\u201d he ordered, still in that offhanded way.</p><p>I did, my hands shaking a little. I didn\u2019t know why I was so nervous, I\u2019d had sex with him more than once that very day, but I was nonetheless. I just never knew exactly what he had planned.</p><p>\u201cGo sit on the edge of the pool. Put your legs in the water, just up to your knees,\u201d he told me, still in that disinterested tone.</p><p>I sat at the edge of the water, leaning back on my hands, watching him.</p> <p>He was completely naked as he took the steps into the shallow pool. The water came just to his hips, his arousal clearly visible above the water. I trembled, biting my lip as I watched him.</p><p>He dipped into the water, just up to a spot right below the tattoo over his heart, standing up straight again almost immediately. All of the wet spots on his body were slick and dripping. My mouth watered. He ran his hands over his slick torso, watching me as he touched his abs and stroked his chest. The plastic covered patch over his heart was the only thing he left untouched.</p><p>He glided towards me, hips moving directly between my knees when he drew close. \u201cWhat does it do to you, when you see someone else put their hands on me?\u201d he asked. \u201cEven the most casual touch. Does it make you crazy? Do you feel like you might do something insane, or even violent? Does it make you sick, deep in your stomach? Does it make your chest hurt, and your insides clench? Does a red haze overtake your vision? Do you lose all ability to be civil, or even form a coherent thought?\u201d He moved against me as he spoke, his mouth speaking directly into my ear, his tone so cold it made my whole body shiver with a delicious kind of fear. He was in a mood, and he had plans for me. I just knew it. And it was nothing I could predict.</p><p>\u201cAnswer me,\u201d he said, biting my earlobe with enough force to make my back arch, pushing my breasts into his slick chest.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes to what? Which of those things happens when you see someone else\u2019s hands on me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll of it. I can\u2019t even trust myself, it makes me so crazed. I don\u2019t recognize the person I become when I\u2019m jealous. It\u2019s nothing I\u2019ve ever had to deal with before. I hate it.\u201d</p><p>He was adjusting my body as I spoke, bringing my hips to the very edge of pool, which made my words even more breathless and desperate.</p><p>He poised himself at my entrance. \u201cGood,\u201d he said, his voice still cold, but with anger now. He entered me, having to work himself in slowly at that angle, my hips right on the edge of the pool.</p><p>\u201cWhy is that good?\u201d I asked him on a little moan, my eyes going to his as he penetrated me. I had been well conditioned. My eyes couldn\u2019t seem to look away from him now when he was inside of me.</p><p>\u201cI want you to feel what I feel. I want you to know what that does to me, what it\u2019s like to feel jealous and covetous. And now you do.\u201d</p> <p>One of his hands, which had been at my hip, moved up to my neck. He circled it, squeezing lightly.</p><p>\u201cGrab my wrist with your hands,\u201d he ordered.</p><p>I obeyed.</p><p>\u201cIf you look away from me, I\u2019ll let up,\u201d he told me. \u201cBut I want you to scratch me while I choke you. I want you to try to rip my hand away. I want you to struggle, but don\u2019t look away unless it\u2019s too much.</p><p>That will be your safe word, since you won\u2019t be able to speak.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, trembling and watching his beautiful eyes.</p><p>He used his other hand to push my legs wider apart as the hand at my neck began to squeeze. He thrust slowly in and out of me, but they were heavy thrusts, and so deep.</p><p>My hands began to tug at his hard hand at my neck, and I dug my nails into that thick wrist, hesitant at first, but as the pressure increased, I raked at him desperately, lightheaded with the sensation. My head fell back, and he perched me back like that, his hand squeezing and releasing in time to his heavy strokes.</p> <p>My vision started to get a little hazy, and that\u2019s when he would let up, beginning the drugging process all over again. I hadn\u2019t realized my neck could be such a source of intoxicating pleasure, not in that way. My very pulse seemed to throb in time to his rhythm inside of me. I did what he told me and struggled against him, particularly his hand and wrist, but not one inch of my body wanted him to stop. The choking and the struggling was a marvel to me.</p><p>I saw with clarity that I loved to struggle against him, loved to fight him wildly, my efforts not even straining him, not even slowing his purpose. His sheer strength floored me. I relished it.</p><p>His grip tightened as he began to pound relentlessly.</p><p>My vision went spotty, and I came so violently that I wasn\u2019t sure how long the orgasm lasted, and I wasn\u2019t certain if I had blacked out for a fuzzy moment.</p><p>When I focused again, James had his choking hand gripped in my hair to hold me in place as he rubbed out the last of his own orgasm inside of me. He was making these deliciously shivery little involuntary thrusts, his neck arched back. His eyes found mine again, his heavy-lidded and sated.</p><p>\u201cWas it too much, Love?\u201d he asked, his voice low and hoarse. \u201cYou were having such a fit, I couldn\u2019t tell if you passed out.\u201d As he spoke, he hugged me against him, tilting my head back to look at him from where I was pressed to his chest.</p><p>\u201cIt was...exquisite. It was fucking perfect, James.\u201d</p><p>He swallowed hard, studying me. \u201cIt would have been, if we could keep eye contact at the end doing that. But I probably don\u2019t have to ask if choking is on your \u2018yes\u2019 list. I think I can figure it out. I need to be very careful with that. You\u2019re so delicate, and I have the urge to be...overzealous when I get your neck in my hands.\u201d</p><p>He pulled out of me suddenly, shuddering as he did so. I was right there with him.</p><p>\u201cWe need to get moving. We need to rush, actually.\u201d He tugged me into the water, dragging me to the steps with a firm grip on the the ring of my choker.</p><p>He dried us both with businesslike efficiency, leaving the spa\u2019s plush towels on the floor.</p><p>\u201cGet dressed quickly,\u201d he told me.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE</p><p>We dressed quickly, rushing out of the resort. James held my nape, steering me out of the vast property.</p><p>I was completely lost by the time we reached the casino. The place was colossal.</p><p>James\u2019s car was waiting when we got to the valet station, Clark ready with the door open wide. He inclined his head to us politely, his face warm and smiling. I thought the stoic man might be softening towards me. \u201cSir. Ms. Karlsson.\u201d</p><p>James was silent until Clark got behind the wheel and started driving, rather speedily towards my house, before he leaned in close to my ear to speak to me. We were sitting very close, but not touching, which was unusual for James.</p><p>\u201cSo, when do I get to pierce these?\u201d he asked quietly. As he spoke he reached up a hand, pinching first one nipple and then the other. He quickly withdrew his hand.</p><p>My mind just went sort of...blank. It had hovered around in the back of my mind in a sort of disjointed way when I\u2019d seen the tattoos, but it was still a shock to hear it out loud. I mulled it over, thinking about the ink he\u2019d gotten on his beautiful skin. If he wanted so badly for me to do this thing, why not? I couldn\u2019t say that I would like the piercings, but I couldn\u2019t say that I wouldn\u2019t, either.</p><p>\u201cI thought that was all a joke,\u201d I told him, but I didn\u2019t say no.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t joking, obviously. But if that\u2019s really what you thought, I won\u2019t make you do it. And I am certainly willing to wait until you\u2019re ready. There\u2019s no reason to rush it.\u201d</p><p>I thought about it, really thought about the deal we\u2019d made. I had told myself that he was joking, but had I really thought that he was? If I was honest, I had known on some level that, though he was being playful, he always did exactly as he said he would.</p><p>I met his gaze steadily. \u201cI\u2019ll do it. I think I tried to convince myself that you were joking, but I\u2019m beginning to understand you enough to know that you always do as you say.\u201d</p><p>He pulled my head back lightly by the hair, and began to kiss me, an open-mouthed, hot kiss. He took his time before pulling back. \u201cThank you for being honest. But you still don\u2019t need to do it. I wouldn\u2019t force you, even if the thought appeals to me strongly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it. I said I would. And, though I can\u2019t deny I\u2019ve never thought of doing something like that, it appeals to me simply because you want it so badly. I can\u2019t seem to help myself. I want to please you. I love to please you.\u201d</p><p>He reacted strangely with a sharply indrawn breath. He leaned his head back against his seat, shutting his eyes, his face a little drawn.</p><p>He found my hand and squeezed it in his. \u201cThank you, Bianca.\u201d</p><p>An unexpected laugh escaped me suddenly. He opened his eyes, giving me a puzzled look.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I told him, smiling warmly into his eyes. \u201cYou just looked so relieved that I would pierce my nipples and it struck me as funny. That\u2019s such a strange thing to be relieved about.\u201d</p><p>He smiled at me, but it didn\u2019t reach his eyes. It was a sad kind of smile, and I felt my own fade a little.</p><p>\u201cI was relieved, but not about the piercing. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m very happy about that. But it was what you said that eased my mind. The thought that you love to please me, it gives me hope. If you truly love to please me, you won\u2019t leave me. You\u2019ll stay with me, and live with me. If not now, then eventually. I can at least hope to talk you into it.\u201d</p><p>I flushed. I still thought moving in with him was ridiculous, but I could see that I had already softened towards the idea, and for just the reason he had latched onto. I loved to please him. But more, I loved him. I wondered if I would have the courage to tell him. Not anytime soon. It was still a shock to me to even think it, to even realize it fully. How had this happened so fast? But how not? With him being so charming, and so perfect, so heart-achingly beautiful, but tarnished in all of the right places, and in all of the ways that I understood so well, how could I not love him?</p><p>\u201cDid you like Frankie?\u201d he asked. The change of topic made me flush, but for a different reason. And why did he sound so smug when he asked that question?</p><p>My mouth tightened involuntarily. \u201cHave you slept with her? Because you seem to like her,\u201d I told him, trying to pull my hand away.</p><p>He gripped it more tightly, still with that smug smile. \u201cNo. She\u2019s a very close friend of mine, though, so I would like you to get along with her.\u201d</p><p>I felt my face turning red. I looked away from his infuriating face. \u201cI doubt I will. She likes to touch you, and talk about your body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould it make you feel better to know that she\u2019s a gold star lesbian, and a dominant herself? She and I are as about as platonic as a male and a female can be.\u201d</p><p>I blushed impossibly harder, feeling silly and ridiculous suddenly. Because it did make me feel better to know that. Worlds better. I was a fool.</p><p>\u201cWhat is a gold star lesbian?\u201d I asked him.</p><p>\u201cNever been with a man, never even thought about it. She liked you, I could tell. I should probably be the jealous one, with the way she was looking at you. But I\u2019m not. She\u2019s too good of a friend. She may be envious of what we have, but she would never cross a line. She knows that you\u2019re important to me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI-I wouldn\u2019t-even if she wanted to,\u201d I stammered, feeling flustered at where the conversation had gone.</p><p>Did he think I would be submissive to any dom? I didn\u2019t understand that, and I was just too embarrassed to ask. I wasn\u2019t just interested in James because he could dominate me. I wondered, for the first time, if he felt that I used him for only that aspect of himself. I wanted to ask him, but the words just wouldn\u2019t come out. I never felt used by him, and I had just assumed that a man so perfect and confident couldn\u2019t feel used. Not by someone like me.</p><p>He kissed my hand softly as we pulled up to my house. \u201cI know. But in some circles, having a dom so much as approach your sub is a huge breach of conduct. It\u2019s not something you have to worry about. And I don\u2019t feel threatened by Frankie. It would please me if you two could be friends, actually. Would you be willing to go have dinner with her sometime? The three of us, I mean.\u201d</p><p>I felt a little mortified. I had very nearly been openly rude to the woman. \u201cIf she still wants to, I would be willing to. I feel like a fool. I was so jealous of her. I thought for sure you two had been lovers.\u201d</p> <p>He just smiled that smug smile again as he ushered me out of the car. \u201cShe won\u2019t be fazed by that. I\u2019ll set it up.\u201d</p><p>I had only thirty minutes to get ready once we walked in the door. I hurried, packing up my suitcase before moving to get dressed.</p><p>I had just slipped off my bra, grabbing the one I preferred for work, when James pressed up behind me.</p><p>He had already changed into dark blue slacks and a pale blue polo that hugged his chiseled torso distractingly. He had been ready before I\u2019d even finished packing. He gripped my breasts, kneading at the supple globes. He moved his fingers to my nipples, twisting them almost cruelly.</p><p>I gasped, arching my back. He released the captive flesh abruptly. I felt him digging into his pocket, still pressed hard against me. I looked down at my quivering breasts while he fastened nipple clamps to each hardened crest.</p> <p>He slapped my ass, hard, before stepping away. \u201cOkay, get dressed. And don\u2019t even think of taking those off. I\u2019m driving you and Stephan to work. He\u2019s already ready and waiting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t you be late for the flight if you drop us off first?\u201d</p><p>He just gave me a look. \u201cI\u2019ll make it. But you need to quit arguing and get dressed. If I have to take the time to spank you, then we\u2019ll both be late.\u201d</p><p>I scrambled into my clothes, double checking my suitcase to make sure I had everything.</p><p>\u201cRemember, you don\u2019t need to pack for New York anymore. You\u2019re all set up there, and you can buy anything you want, if I overlooked something. By the way, I was a little distracted, but your hair looks lovely. I like the cut. It brings out those devastating eyes of yours.\u201d</p><p>I shot him a look. He thought my eyes were devastating? The irony wasn\u2019t lost on me, his exquisite turquoise gaze captivating me at a glance.</p> <p>\u201cThank you. Thank you for the spa day. It was a very nice treat for my friends and I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnytime. You can take them as often as you like. The staff knows that you have carte blanche status.</p><p>You don\u2019t need an appointment, or even to call ahead, though it\u2019s never a bad idea to give them a heads- up. Everything that\u2019s mine is yours, love. I mean that in every sense you could imagine. Feel free to test it.\u201d</p><p>I straightened my tie as he spoke, feeling the clamps on my heavy breasts acutely.</p><p>I moved to my vanity, clasping my watch over the angry marks on one wrist. I studied the other one, wondering how to cover it. It really wasn\u2019t even uncomfortable. It just looked rather conspicuous. As I studied it, James circled it with long fingers, reaching into my silver jewelry box. He pulled a smaller box out of it that I hadn\u2019t even noticed before. He opened it, showing a platinum bracelet that closely matched the band pattern of the rolex he\u2019d given me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re shackled and collared, my love,\u201d James said as he fastened it onto my wrist. They did indeed look like shackles, I thought, as he led me from the house, pulling my suitcase. \u201cDo they chafe your wrists too badly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not at all. My wrists aren\u2019t bothering me at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I have plans for you. We get to spend some time in our playground tomorrow, before we have to get ready for the gala.\u201d</p> <p>I had nearly forgotten about the gala. He had swept me up so thoroughly from the moment we had reunited, I had forgotten about everything save for my Mr. Beautiful.</p><p>Stephan started in on James almost the moment we all got into the car. \u201cBianca thought that tattoo and piercing thing was a joke. You can\u2019t hold her to it, James,\u201d he said, looking ready for an argument.</p><p>James smiled. Contrarily, it was a rather fond smile, and all for Stephan. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t dream of it, Stephan. Bianca, would I hold you to doing something like that, if you didn\u2019t want to?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, giving Stephan an exasperated look. I was blushing involuntarily. I sooo didn\u2019t want to talk about things like that with Stephan, especially not in front of James. \u201cStephan, he knows I thought it was a joke. Please don\u2019t get upset about it. James is crazy, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>Stephan gave a very heartfelt sigh of relief. He had been dreading the confrontation, but had obviously felt a strong need to say something. \u201cOkay, okay. Sorry, I just saw those tattoos, and remembered what you two had said at the bar. I didn\u2019t know you had it in you, James.\u201d</p><p>James grinned, hugging me to him. He kissed my forehead rather sweetly. \u201cI didn\u2019t, not until I met my perfect Bianca.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR</p><p>The flight was an agonizing ordeal. Every time my aching breasts pulled or strained at the clamps, which was constantly, I thought of James, and it left me yearning and hot but still with a job to do.</p><p>It was a full flight, the only empty seat the one next to James, as was his habit.</p><p>I rushed and served and passed him again and again, my sensitized breasts sending little jolts right to my sex every time I so much as thought of him.</p><p>He barely glanced at me, working on his laptop. He didn\u2019t even look up as I asked him direct questions, just gave brief answers, his bored gaze on the screen of his laptop. He was the disinterested master tonight. It made me want to scream, I was so agitated and keyed up. I wanted to hit him, I was so frustrated. The fact that he wouldn\u2019t even look at me drove me crazy.</p><p>It was nearly two hours into the flight before the cabin began to get quiet and sleepy. Most of the first class passengers were drinking heavily, so I had been on my feet in the cabin, serving almost constantly.</p><p>Stephan headed back to help coach as soon as our regular service was done. Javier was on the flight as a passenger, though he hadn\u2019t been able to snag a first class seat. Flying non-revenue, we only got first class seats when there was space available. He had been lucky to find a seat at all, since the flight had been overbooked. That would have been a waste, since he had taken days off to join Stephan on our layover.</p><p>My passengers were all taken care of, most falling asleep or already there. A few alert faces could be seen, but I was suddenly too desperate to care, my usual professional reserve escaping me in a brash moment.</p><p>I sat down in the empty seat next to James. I leaned over the console that separated the two seats, grabbing his wrist, pulling it from the keyboard of his laptop. Finally, he looked at me.</p><p>His gaze was amused, and I wanted to scream. \u201cNo touching, Bianca. That\u2019s an order.\u201d</p><p>I dropped his wrist like it was on fire, breathing heavily as I glared at him. His smiling eyes were wickedly infuriating. I tried to compose myself, tried to smooth my features. I knew I failed. \u201cPlease, Mr. Cavendish, I\u2019m desperate. Why are you ignoring me? You\u2019ve put these...things on me, and I can\u2019t think of anything but you. Meet me in the restroom. I need you to touch me.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, still just looking amused. \u201cNot tonight, Bianca.\u201d</p><p>I clasped my hands together tightly, nearly overwhelmed with the urge to touch him. \u201cAre you punishing me?\u201d</p><p>He ran his tongue across those perfect teeth. My sex clenched, and I felt a rush of moisture between my legs. \u201cNo. Just teaching you. Sometimes we have to wait for what we want. I have been extremely lax in this part of your instruction, but you need to learn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so wet, James. And I think if you just keep talking, your voice alone could make me come.</p><p>Please.\u201d</p><p>His eyes turned a little hard. \u201cYou won\u2019t entice me into changing my mind, you little vixen. You\u2019ll be punished if you try that again.\u201d</p><p>I wanted that punishment, wanted it badly, but I wanted to please him more. \u201cI can\u2019t bear this. What should I do, Mr. Cavendish? I could go into the bathroom and pleasure myself. It\u2019s not what I want, but I think it would help.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed into an almost mean glare. \u201cNo. You\u2019re not allowed to touch yourself, either.\u201d His eyes moved to a spot behind my seat. \u201cYou need to move, Bianca. That seat is spoken for.\u201d</p><p>I got up, moving away, feeling baffled and bereft. I noted absently that Javier took the vacated seat, giving me a polite nod. I nodded back, moving away as Stephan stepped in close to them, thanking James for relinquishing his extra seat.</p><p>That was nice of him, I thought absently. James began to chat amiably with Javier, not sparing me another glance.</p><p>I went into the galley, not knowing what to do with myself. I took off my serving vest, leaving just my white dress shirt and tie. My nipples stood out like sore thumbs with the clamps on them in such a thin shirt. I decided I didn\u2019t care. I wanted James to see how conspicuous they were, how impossible to ignore. He had left me wanting, and seemed unaffected himself. I wanted to affect him.</p><p>I returned to Javier, asking him politely if he needed anything. I felt James\u2019s gaze on me then, since I had interrupted their polite small talk.</p><p>\u201cJust a bottle of water, please. Thank you, Bianca,\u201d Javier said with a smile.</p><p>I smiled back, not looking at James. I turned away, heading back to the front of the plane.</p><p>\u201cBianca,\u201d James called, his voice very casual.</p><p>I looked at him over my shoulder, my brow arched.</p><p>\u201cPut your vest back on, Love. Now.\u201d James gave me a bland smile, as though he hadn\u2019t just given me an arbitrary order in front of Javier, in front of strangers.</p><p>I fumed as I went back into the galley. I hadn\u2019t gotten around to putting my vest back on when Damien stepped out of the cockpit to use the restroom. He stepped into my galley when he saw me, smiling warmly. I had seen him briefly on the crew bus, but we had been in too big of a hurry to chat. His smile dropped a little when he saw that I was visibly agitated.</p><p>\u201cEverything all right?\u201d he asked, concern in his voice.</p><p>I just nodded, meeting his eyes while I took deep breaths. I should have realized that the action would accentuate my conspicuous breasts, but I didn\u2019t, not until his eyes roamed there, widening when they saw the outline of my clamped nipples. I didn\u2019t think he could see the actual clamps, but I really wasn\u2019t sure.</p><p>I thought he must have just seen my over exaggerated nipples. Whatever he saw, it seemed to freeze him in place. He couldn\u2019t seem to look away from my chest. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He put a hand on my shoulder, licking his lips nervously. \u201cCan I help you with anything?\u201d he asked in a low voice.</p><p>I just shook my head, still looking at him. I didn\u2019t remove his hand, didn\u2019t think of it. My mind wasn\u2019t working right. I knew that James wasn\u2019t touching me, but all I could think about were his hands on me.</p><p>So while I knew that it was Damien\u2019s hand on me, it felt almost as if James was touching me. And besides, it was only my shoulder he was touching. But I was in a state.</p><p>\u201cKindly remove that hand, Damien. Shouldn\u2019t you be flying the plane or something?\u201d James asked, stepping into the galley. His voice was cold as ice. I didn\u2019t have to look at his eyes to know that they would be the same.</p> <p>Damien pulled his hand back, eyes wide, looking as though he\u2019d been doing something much worse than just touching my shoulder. He mumbled an agreement, backing off and going into the lavatory.</p><p>I felt more than saw James moving to me. He plucked my vest from where it hung on an open cabinet, holding it out for me to slip into. I did so without a word, not looking at him.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that, Bianca? Do you want him? Explain it to me.\u201d His voice was still so cold. I was intimated and...embarrassed.</p><p>\u201cI-I don\u2019t want him. I think he was just caught off-guard. And I...I was just distracted, thinking about you. I know he was standing right in front of me, but I couldn\u2019t seem to focus on him.\u201d</p><p>James gripped my hair at the nape, the only place he touched me, pulling my head back to look up and squarely into his eyes. They were more shuttered than I would have guessed. Whatever he was feeling, I couldn\u2019t have guessed it from his face.</p> <p>\u201cI told you this wasn\u2019t a punishment, Bianca, but it is now.\u201d He pulled my hair hard enough to make me gasp. His voice was strangely blank. \u201cIt will be better or worse, depending on your answer. Were you trying to make me jealous by letting him touch you, or are you drawn to him? Do you want him, just a little?\u201d</p><p>I mulled it over, wanting to give him the most honest answer, dreading the punishment, when it was this overwhelming depravation. \u201cI was too involved with my own thoughts to react to what he was doing. I think I would have reacted, would have pulled away, if he had touched more than my shoulder, but he didn\u2019t, so I didn\u2019t. I just don\u2019t think of him like that.\u201d</p><p>I was relishing his hands on me, even with this limited contact, as I continued breathlessly. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t feel like a threat, and I\u2019ve never even thought about having sex with him. I couldn\u2019t tell you why. I can see that he\u2019s good looking, and I value him as a friend. He\u2019s funny, and charming, and nice, but I\u2019ve only ever had platonic feelings. Perhaps it\u2019s something like how you feel about Frankie. For all I know, he\u2019s another submissive. That may be why I could only see him as a friend.\u201d</p><p>He studied me for the longest time, his eyes still shuddered, but if I had to guess, I would say that he was feeling hurt and worried.</p><p>\u201cI like your answer,\u201d he finally said. \u201cI can\u2019t tell if I believe it because I want so desperately to, or because it\u2019s the truth. You\u2019ll still be punished, but I won\u2019t draw it out like I was planning to when I saw his hand on you. Don\u2019t let it happen again.\u201d With that, he walked away.</p><p>The rest of the flight was long and James wouldn\u2019t so much as spare me a glance. When he deprived me, he deprived me of everything, even his beautiful eyes, and that intense regard that I had come to adore and depend on so helplessly. I hadn\u2019t realized how much I craved even his stare, how it made me feel less empty, less cold. He was the sun, and when he turned away, I felt so cold and empty, so achy and wanting.</p> <p>I hadn\u2019t realized it before. Is that why I was getting this lesson? Had he known the extent of his affect on me, and known how to show me just how much I needed him to want me, needed him to show me.</p><p>The depravation of his physical affection affected me first, but I thought that the emotional withdrawal from him was by far more devastating. And I wouldn\u2019t have realized it, wouldn\u2019t have realized how generously he had always tended to my emotional needs, until he had set my body on fire and withdrawn from me completely. It was a revelation.</p><p>He was a generous man. I had never doubted it. But I had never given him credit for being so generous with his emotions and feelings. They were things I never would have realized I needed so desperately until he\u2019d lavished me with them, and then suddenly taken them away. How long would I feel the loss?</p><p>How long would he put me through purgatory? It had only been hours so far that he had left me wanting, but I didn\u2019t know that I could bear much more of it.</p><p>I wanted to bask in the sun again.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going directly to my house,\u201d James told me as he walked with my crew through the airport.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t touching me, but pulled my bag. He would barely look at me, though his tone and posture seemed relaxed.</p> <p>I had gone past the point of only wanting him to make me come, to ease the ache that traveled from my tortured nipples and directly to my sex. Now I wanted his affection, his attention. I wanted him to hold me. It made me almost angry, that he would make me so needy with so little effort on his part. But even anger didn\u2019t change the wanting.</p><p>It took me a moment to process his words. We were trailing behind my crew. Melissa cast me sharp glances, as though we were slowing them down. I ignored her. It seemed the best way to deal with her in general.</p><p>\u201cI could get into trouble for that,\u201d I told him, my voice pitched low. \u201cWe\u2019re supposed to ride with the crew to the hotel, and check in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI spoke to Stephan. He looked it up in the manual. The exact wording is, \u2018at the discretion of your lead\u2019. Stephan is your lead. He gave you the thumbs up. You\u2019re coming with me.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t argue, didn\u2019t respond. I wanted to get to his house. I didn\u2019t know what he had planned, but I was sure that the sooner we got there, the sooner this torture would end.</p><p>I waved goodbye to most of the crew at the curb, only giving Stephan a quick hug and kiss.</p><p>\u201cCall me if you need anything, Buttercup,\u201d he said into my ear, then let me go.</p><p>I scooted in close against James, nearly touching hips when we got into his town car.</p><p>I spoke into his ear, since the privacy screen was down and I didn\u2019t recognize the driver. \u201cThis is more than delayed gratification. You\u2019re depriving me of every part of you. You\u2019ll barely look at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in the car,\u201d he said, looking out the window and dismissing me.</p><p>I felt stung.</p><p>\u201cWhat is the punishment for touching you?\u201d I asked him after several minutes of complete silence. I was past the point of only wanting to please him. If it was a punishment I could stand, I was willing to risk his displeasure. He had brought me to that point.</p><p>\u201cA simple one. If you touch me, I won\u2019t touch you,\u201d he said, his tone idle.</p><p>It was like a slap in the face. I averted my face, tears stinging my eyes. It felt like a rejection, something I\u2019d never experienced even a hint of from James.</p><p>It was a long and silent drive into Manhattan. The clamps on my nipples were a constant ache. I had resorted to trying to hold perfectly still, since every movement further agitated the sensual torture.</p><p>I wanted to say mean things to him, hurtful things that might goad him into touching me, but I refrained. I didn\u2019t want to cause him to stay this withdrawn from me. I knew that the more I cooperated, the sooner I would get my James back.</p><p>Finally, the unfamiliar driver dropped us off in the underground garage I\u2019d been in once before, on my first visit to James\u2019s Manhattan penthouse.</p><p>He took my suitcase out of the trunk, inclining his head at us. \u201cSir, Ms. Karlsson. I\u2019ll be here at 9:00 p.m to pick you up for the charity event.\u201d</p><p>James just nodded, dismissing the man. He pulled my suitcase to the elevator, still barely acknowledging my presence.</p><p>I lowered my chin, my posture rigid, standing very still in my work heels. My gaze seemed glued to his navy dress shoes. They were sexy. I thought sullenly that even his feet held a sort of elegance.</p><p>The elevator car arrived, the door sliding open silently. James stepped inside.</p><p>I hesitated, still just watching his feet, wanting some sign from him that he even remembered my presence.</p><p>He sighed, the softest sound, and reached a hand to me. I watched, transfixed, as his hand went to the collar of my work shirt. He used one finger to fish out the hoop at my throat. He managed not to touch even an inch of my skin, pulling me forward by just that diamond-studded circle. He led me into the car, keeping his finger crooked into my collar as he slid in his card, pushed the button, and we began to ascend.</p><p>\u201cMy perfect little submissive,\u201d he murmured, and that was all. I sopped up even that little bit of his jaded attention.</p><p>He led me into his opulent home by that one finger on my collar. I was as lost in the maze of rooms as I had been the first time, as he led me to the kitchen. He only let go of the collar when we encountered an unfamiliar woman prepping food next to the oversized stovetop. She was plump and middle-aged, with light brown hair and kind brown eyes that I noticed the moment she turned to greet us.</p><p>She smiled. It was a good smile, warm and sweet. \u201cMr. Cavendish, Ms. Karlsson, good morning. How was your flight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery good, thank you. Bianca, this is Marion. She\u2019s our new housekeeper and cook.\u201d</p><p>I blinked my eyes a few times, wondering if I was seeing things when she bobbed us a little curtsy. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to working for you, Ms. Karlsson. It\u2019s nice to finally meet you. Please let me know if you need anything. Anything at all.\u201d</p><p>I processed their words, the way they both implied that she was somehow working for me. It was a baffling development, but I didn\u2019t comment.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m making you vegetable omelets with feta, as you requested, Mr. Cavendish. Is there anything I can do for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe will be in the dining room, Marion. Just serve the omelets when they\u2019re ready. That will be all.\u201d</p><p>James held the door open for me, and I moved into his grand dining room. He pulled a chair out for me and I sat. He took the seat next to me at the head of the table. He stapled his elegant fingers together on top of the heavy table.</p><p>I watched those hands as I spoke. \u201cWhat happened to the other housekeeper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had to let her go. She proved to be...unprofessional. She seemed to think that, because she had worked for me for eight years, she could interfere in my personal life. I found some of her actions and words unacceptable.\u201d</p><p>I mulled that over for awhile, still watching his hands. Even those hands were like eye candy.</p><p>\u201cShe seemed like an unpleasant woman, though she and Jules appeared to be close,\u201d I said absently.</p><p>\u201cShe was pleasant enough to her.\u201d</p><p>I watched his hands squeeze together very tightly as I spoke. \u201cYes. And that was the problem. She let her into my home against my wishes, and then she made the fatal mistake of insulting you, Love. I fired her that night.\u201d</p><p>I took a deep breath, savoring that light endearment. I was starved for his affection. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Marion served us quickly, withdrawing with a smile. We ate the delicious omelets in silence. James finished before me. I could feel him watching me as I took a drink of water. He stood the instant I swallowed my last bite. He led me by the collar through the multi-floored penthouse, heading to his bedroom without further ado.</p><p>I was more than happy to go. I had been living in a world of tortured anticipation since he had pinched on my nipple clamps, just waiting for him to get me alone like this.</p><p>He took me into his colossal bedroom closet.</p><p>\u201cTake off your clothes,\u201d he commanded, shrugging out of his shirt, his back to me. I obeyed without a word, taking off everything but my jewelry. He took off my watch and cuff, putting them on a little tray on the huge dresser in his closet. My eyes had moved to his feet as soon as I was undressed. He was barefoot now, wearing only his slacks. I thought about how even his tan feet were sexy.</p><p>He threaded a silver chain through the hoop at my collar. It attached to each of my nipple clamps, raising my nipples.</p><p>I winced, rubbing my thighs together restlessly.</p><p>He fastened a sheer black half-slip over my hips. I had worn it just once before, in his playground. It covered nothing, but the sight of it turned me on. It made my body look sinful, with just that touch of black. I bit my lip, arching my back a little.</p><p>To say I was turned on was a vast understatement. I was so far past that point. I raised my gaze just enough to see the hard ridge pressing against the front of his navy slacks. I moaned at the sight of it.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t try to tempt me, Bianca. You\u2019ll be punished for that. Is that what you were trying to do?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, out of my mind with wanting him.</p><p>He led me by my collar to the elevator that went directly from his bedroom and into his private playground. I mewled at the cruel pressure that pulled at my nipples. He slapped my ass hard as we descended to his 4th floor. For making the noise, I thought.</p><p>He pulled a length of black cloth from his pocket, stepping behind me in the elevator. It was a blindfold, I realized, as he covered my eyes, tying it firmly in the back. The material was silky and luxuriously soft.</p><p>The elevator stopped, and he pulled me forward by the collar. Our footsteps seemed loud in the hallway, but the padded flooring once we got into the playroom made a softer, muffled sound. He led me only a few steps into the room before stopping.</p><p>\u201cGet on your knees,\u201d he told me.</p><p>I obeyed, raising my chin. I heard him move away.</p><p>I heard him opening drawers across the room. Some sort of machinery whirred softly, the sound of chains clinking together following immediately, and I had no idea what would make such a noise.</p><p>I sat back on my heels, my hands flat on my thighs. I began to rub them slowly over my own skin as I waited, anticipation and fear a palpable feeling along my skin. As my hands rubbed, I shifted my arms, moving them against my breasts, pushing the round globes closer together to rub against each other, craving contact, even if it was just the contact of my own skin on itself.</p><p>\u201cStop that,\u201d James snapped from across the room. \u201cIf you pleasure yourself, then that\u2019s all you\u2019ll do.</p><p>All you\u2019ll get is a dildo to relieve your ache, if you keep that up. Which would you prefer? My cock, or a dildo?\u201d</p><p>I gasped, and stopped moving, though I wanted more than ever to move after hearing his words. \u201cYour cock. Oh god, I want your cock, James.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Mr. Cavendish, or Master, in here, Bianca.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Mr. Cavendish.\u201d</p><p>There was a noise, like chains clinking together, and then he was pulling me to my feet by the collar. I gasped at the rough pull on my nipples. They seemed to be getting more sensitive, not less so, the longer those mean clamps stayed attached.</p> <p>He pulled me across the padded floor. He pulled me maybe twenty feet before stopping abruptly.</p><p>Finally he touched my skin, pulling my wrists together in front of me. The action rubbed my breasts together, and my back arched. He placed something soft around my wrists, closing it with a loud metal clink on first one wrist and then the other. Padded handcuffs, I thought.</p><p>He moved very close to me as he reached above me, pulling down a metal chain that clicked loudly with each link. He dragged the length along my cheek, my collar, against the side of one breast, and finally to my joined hands. He attached the chain rather noisily to the handcuffs, stepping away. I heard the links clinking again as the cuffs were raised above my head agonizingly slowly. My arms pulled up high until I was stretched taut onto the balls of my feet.</p><p>\u201cGrip the chain,\u201d James told me.</p><p>I tried, but obviously did it wrong, because he adjusted my hands until I had a firm double grasp on the chain that held me up. He jerked suddenly on my neat little work braid, arching my head back. It pulled at the chain between my clamped nipples, as everything seemed to.</p><p>I whimpered loudly.</p><p>\u201cI want you to be silent,\u201d James told me, his voice a hoarse rasp. \u201cDon\u2019t make sexy little noises. Don\u2019t beg me to stop. Be as quiet as you can, unless you need to safe word.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX</p><p>I gave a little nod, since I couldn\u2019t speak. I felt him move away. He was gone for long minutes, and I felt bereft. I couldn\u2019t move or speak, because he\u2019d ordered me not to, so only my mind was active. It was the most torturous part of all, as I imagined what he would do to me, what he was planning, and all I could do was wait.</p><p>Soft music began to play, the notes of a dark song drifting through the room. It had an ominous tune.</p><p>I didn\u2019t even sense him move but just suddenly felt something soft brush across the skin of my back. A feather, I realized, as he trailed it down my spine. He removed it, but it was instantly replaced by something else, something rougher, with thin strands that caught at my skin as he stroked it where the feather had been. The feather came back, stroking along my butt and down my thighs.</p><p>I shivered as he softly stroked it over the back of my knee and down to my foot. He moved the feather back up my body via the other leg. It covered every inch of the back of my body before he pulled back.</p><p>The rougher object began to move across my skin, mirroring the feathers trail exactly. Where the feather had made me shiver all over, the rougher trail made me writhe, fighting to keep from making noise.</p><p>The rough little tails were absent, and the feather was back, brushing just below my shoulder blades. It lingered there, slowly whispering over that skin oh so carefully. The feather pulled away and the instant it left my skin he struck, flogging me with those rough little tails viciously.</p><p>I bit my lip so hard I tasted blood, my back arching, spine bowing.</p><p>He struck again and again, only striking those tender spots that the feather had paid such special attention to. My heart was trying to pound out of my chest, and tears ran down my cheeks silently but freely before he stopped.</p><p>I felt him unclip the tiny slip at my waist, felt it drop to the floor, the feather lightly caressing my naked ass. I wondered if he was timing the feather contact to the timing of the flogging. It seemed that way to me, and it was a torturous realization, because he lingered for the longest time on my rear, that soft feather relentless. Of the two touches, I thought the feather was the cruelest.</p><p>The feather\u2019s absence was immediately replaced by the sharp bite of the tails. It went on and on, striking again and again, and I began to move with the strikes, circling my hips, the pain taking my mind to a little fuzzy place, and I thought I would come if he so much as touched my sex.</p><p>I heard his ragged breaths when he replaced the tails with the feather on my thighs. When the feather touched my inner thigh, a scant breath from my sex, I nearly came. I didn\u2019t know if I could stop myself when the tiny whips replaced that cruel feather. I wondered, very briefly, if I would be punished for that.</p><p>My breaths were so ragged that I worried I would be punished for the noise when the tails replaced the feather, slapping at my sensitive thighs relentlessly.</p><p>My back bowed, my feet pushing on my toes as the whips hit that spot on my groin, and I came, gyrating on my chain and biting on my bloody lip. At least I had kept silent, if you didn\u2019t count my loud panting breaths.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d James panted, and that was all. He replaced the little whips with a feather on my calves. This was a shorter touch, and a shorter flogging.</p><p>He seemed to finish with my back, stepping away. I felt him studying me for impossibly long minutes.</p><p>My release had been involuntary, and done very little to ease the ache. My pulse still beat in time to the blood pounding in my veins and every inch of me wanted him inside of me, against me, touching me. My hips made little circling thrusts as he watched me.</p><p>Finally, I felt him moving to the front of my body. He studied my front for nearly as long as he had my back.</p><p>Abruptly, he released my breasts from the mean little clamps. I took deep breaths, counting to ten, trying to keep the noises in my throat. He began to move the feather along my front, starting with my cheek. He circled my lips with the feather.</p><p>He stopped abruptly, walking away. I wanted to scream at his abrupt absence, but he returned almost instantly, placing some type of strap against my mouth.</p><p>\u201cBite down on this if you need to,\u201d he ordered. \u201cDon\u2019t bite your lip anymore. You\u2019ll need stitches if you keep that up.\u201d I bit it. It was an instant relief to have something firm to bite down on.</p><p>He started in on me with the feather again, covering the front of my body with those soft caresses. He mirrored the movement with the tiny whips. The pattern was already familiar, but still I agonized over what he would do next. The feather was back again, and I knew what to expect when the whips had a turn, every touch telling me sadistically just where and for how long I would get the attention of those mean little tails.</p><p>He softly caressed my upper thighs first, using his foot to part my legs, snaking that little feather in dangerously close to my wet core. I felt the feather drag a little through the moisture there, and heard James suck in a gasp. But there was still no pause as he pulled back the feather and struck with the whip in almost the same motion, as though they were two sides of the same object. I wondered, rather distantly, if they were.</p><p>He struck my thighs again and again, stopping abruptly, but I knew that if I had been counting, it would have timed the same as the feather.</p><p>My head fell back, and I sucked in harsh breaths when the light touch made contact with my breasts. He caressed the fleshy globes for long moments, thankfully only briefly teasing at my tortured nipples. When he began to whip me there, I shuddered, my body on the brink of release when he stopped.</p><p>He stared at me for the longest time, until I heard him unzip his pants.</p><p>I wanted to sob in relief just at the sound.</p><p>He moved to my back. \u201cThat\u2019s enough of a lesson and a punishment, I think,\u201d he said, his voice rough and affected. Just how I wanted it.</p><p>His smooth chest moved against my back as he leaned into me from behind. \u201cGrip the chains more tightly,\u201d he told me, his hard hands settling on my hips.</p><p>I obeyed eagerly.</p><p>\u201cArch your back. More.\u201d</p><p>I felt the tip of his cock at my entrance. It poised there for long moments, quivering against me. He entered me, but not how I wanted, not with a hard thrust, as I was wishing for. He worked his large length inside of me, inch by thick inch, working into my tight wet sheath agonizingly slowly. I wanted to cry. I wanted to beg. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His mouth moved to my ear. \u201cNow you may beg me,\u201d he whispered, as though reading my mind.</p><p>I did beg, sobbing as I did so, the strap falling from my mouth, his permission acting as a floodgate. I begged with heartfelt feeling. He pulled out of me slowly when I\u2019d finished. His mouth moved to the spot between my neck and shoulder, right on the tendon, that perfect sensitive spot, and he bit down savagely at the same moment that he plunged into me, hammering into me with the hardest, fastest thrust. It was a wonderful, brutal angle, my hips held immobile in his hands. I had no way to move with him or away from him, even my toes lifted slightly off the floor.</p><p>He bottomed out in me, reaching the end of me with a vicious twist of his hips.</p><p>He was making this perfect little noise low in his throat, deep but almost helpless, as though he couldn\u2019t believe what was happening every time he slammed into the end of me. The third time he made that noise, I came, screaming.</p><p>He didn\u2019t stop, still pounding , one hand snaking from my hip and up over my tortured breast. It hurt, my skin raw, but that pain seemed to jolt directly from my breast to deep inside my sex, where his stiff cock still worked furiously.</p><p>The second release caught me like that, a mix of pleasure and pain, jolting through the parts of my body that he played like an instrument. I was perfectly tuned, but only to his expert touch.</p><p>His thrusts stuttered for a moment, the hand at my hip sliding forward from my hip and his finger began to circle my clit. He resumed his pace, the arm now anchored over me from waist to pelvis and his other hand still a vise on my breast. His hardness rocked into me with that furious pace.</p><p>He slammed, slammed, slammed, his breathing harsh and ragged enough that I could hear it over my own uncontrollable mewling.</p><p>\u201cCome,\u201d he ordered roughly.</p><p>I shuddered as the waves of pleasure took me for a third time. He allowed himself to come with me that time, and I felt him shuddering and pouring inside of me, making those sounds I loved deep in his throat.</p><p>His hard arms wrapped around my waist, his cheek touching the top of my head.</p><p>Was the tender lover back? I wanted that, had never wanted it more. I needed some reassurance that this coldness that had overtaken him wasn\u2019t permanent. Only a night of it and I felt emotionally bereft.</p><p>But he released me quickly, pulling out of me, and I heard the chains clanking together as my arms went a little slack. It put me more solidly onto my feet, but my knees gave way almost instantly. The cuffs caught me right away, since he\u2019d only lowered me a few inches.</p><p>\u201cGet your balance back. Get some weight onto your feet,\u201d James ordered, lowering the chain a few more inches.</p><p>I put more weight on my feet, catching my balance slowly, shifting from foot to foot until I felt like I could stand without aid. It took awhile.</p><p>He unwound the chains above me until I was taking all of my weight. He unlatched my cuffed hands. I didn\u2019t have to hold my own weight for more than a split second before he swept me off my feet, cradling me like a child as he carried me across the room.</p><p>I stroked my cheek along his bare, sweaty chest. He felt divine. He smelled divine.</p><p>He laid me down on a firmly cushioned surface. It felt like being on an examination table at the doctors office. I hadn\u2019t seen anything like it the last time I\u2019d been in his playground, but I\u2019d only been there once before, and I\u2019d been more than a little distracted at the time He drew my cuffed hands above my head, fastening them there. I tested the restraint. I didn\u2019t even have an inch of slack. He fastened my feet to the bottom of the table, parted slightly. He used soft straps of some kind on each of my ankles, though I couldn\u2019t have said what they were. I was still blindfolded, and it wasn\u2019t anything he\u2019d ever used on me before. I tested those restraints as well. There was no give at all. He definitely couldn\u2019t fuck me in this position. My legs wouldn\u2019t part far enough with the way I was bound.</p><p>I writhed a little at that realization, suddenly afraid of what he did plan to do.</p><p>He slapped the front of my thigh, hard. \u201cDon\u2019t move,\u201d he ordered, his voice all dominance, with no hint of affection.</p><p>My tender lover was still missing. I didn\u2019t think there was anything that I wouldn\u2019t endure to get him back.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN</p><p>A little shriek escaped my lips as I felt cold metal grip one of my nipples firmly.</p> <p>I felt James untying my blindfold, and suddenly I could see again. He had what looked like tiny smooth metal forceps holding my nipple captive. The end was a small hoop that fit perfectly around my hardened nipple. He reached into a drawer inside the table with his free hand, pulling out a marker. He bent close to my chest as he carefully marked my nipple on both sides.</p><p>His hands were covered in latex gloves that I hadn\u2019t heard him put on, though he must have done so sometime since he had bound me to the table. His eyes were intent, studying the marks he\u2019d made.</p><p>Finally, he put the pen away, pulling out a thick needle with a sharpened end. I could see that it was hollowed out in the middle, but I was still surprised at how big it was, how intimidatingly thick.</p><p>He smiled slightly as he saw my eyes widen as I studied the needle. \u201cYou ready to be pierced?\u201d he asked, his voice wicked.</p><p>I studied him. He still wore his slacks, though the top button was undone. He was shirtless, and I could see my name in crimson over his heart. Somehow, I had almost forgotten about his new tattoos. The crimson lettering was startling and lovely against all of his golden skin.</p><p>He had his hair tied back, the first time I had seen him do that, so he could work on the piercing without his hair in his eyes. Some people were more beautiful with hair framing their faces, but it didn\u2019t matter with James. He was exquisite even without all of that caramel hair falling artfully into his face. His face was just too perfect for it to affect his looks either way.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful,\u201d I told him. I couldn\u2019t seem to keep it in.</p><p>He sent me a very hot glance. He loved my admiration, I could tell. Even in this cold mood, he wasn\u2019t immune. \u201cYou think flattery will distract me?\u201d</p><p>I blinked at him. It wasn\u2019t flattery. It was fact. \u201cYou\u2019re magnificent.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t respond, just pulled my nipple taut with the tongs, digging the thick needle into my skin. I held my breath, waiting for him to drive it in. I couldn\u2019t seem to look away.</p><p>He surprised me when he pulled back, opening the drawer underneath me and dropping the needle and forceps inside. By the look on his face, he\u2019d surprised himself.</p><p>He stripped off the latex gloves, tossing them aside. His eyes were on my breasts as he bent down to me, sucking on the abused nipples. He did it with singleminded focus, drawing on the flesh like his life depended on it.</p><p>I writhed beneath his ministrations, though my movements were hampered considerably. My head was bent forward as far as it would go and I watched him. His eyes were closed as he suckled there. His hands cupped my breasts from the sides, pushing them close together. He moved to my other breast, opening his eyes to gaze up at me, watching me as he very deliberately lapped at the flesh and then sucked so hard that a shudder went through my body, the sensation causing a shock of pleasure to shoot directly to my core.</p><p>He didn\u2019t lift his head when he spoke, his breath punching at my skin, his eyes steady and heavy-lidded on mine. \u201cI\u2019m going to drink your milk like this when you breastfeed our children.\u201d He bent down and began to suck again, drawing at it with hard suction, as though the large globes were already filled with milk. His words made my sex clench.</p><p>I told myself to reprimand him for saying something so outrageous. To imply that we would have children was stepping over a line, and saying that he would nurse on me like a babe, well, that was just wrong, but my body didn\u2019t care. It thrived on any kinky thing that came out of his mouth.</p><p>He straightened. My hips were making little twisting motions even as he pulled away. He watched them, his eyes almost lazy, the lids were so heavy.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t pierce you yet. I won\u2019t be able to suck on your nipples, or even play with them, while the piercings heal. That will take months. I just can\u2019t bear to do it yet. Perhaps in a week or two.\u201d He released my ankles as he spoke, and then my arms, swiftly releasing my cuffs. It always amazed me how quickly he untied my restraints, as though he\u2019d been trained to do it. For all I knew, he had.</p><p>He cradled me against him. \u201cPut your arms around my neck, Love,\u201d he murmured, striding from the room.</p><p>Even his voice had changed. It had softened between one moment and the next. The tender lover was back. My James was back.</p><p>\u201cI missed you,\u201d I murmured against his sweaty chest.</p><p>He gazed down at me, and I could see real surprise in his eyes as he stepped into the elevator car. \u201cI can\u2019t shirk my duties to you, as your dom. I know what you need, Bianca. And I need you to know that no one else can give it to you like I can.\u201d He punched the button, and we began to ascend as he spoke.</p><p>I wanted to respond, but he gripped my hair and leaned down to kiss me. It was a desperate kind of kiss, not altogether practiced. He ate at my mouth like he was starving for me, as though the distance he had put between us had affected him as well. He licked at my mouth, sucking at my injured bottom lip.</p><p>It hurt, but I didn\u2019t mind hurting, and I kissed him back with all of the pent-up longing he had built in me over the cold evening. There was so much I wanted to tell him, about my feelings, about his, and I tried to put it into the kiss. I was much better at communicating my feelings to him in this manner.</p><p>The elevator stopped and he stepped off, still kissing me, as he strode to his beautiful bed. He laid me on it, pulling away to push his slacks off impatiently. It took the briefest moment, and he was back, arranging me in the middle of the bed.</p><p>He parted my legs wide, moving his hips between them, lowering his chest to mine. He was propped up slightly on his elbows, and he moved those elbows almost into my armpits so he could cup my face as he stared down at me.</p><p>His eyes were so tender and soft that an embarrassing tear slid down my cheek. His thumb caught it, and he pressed his thick arousal against my sex, pressing that first perfect inch inside of me. He entered me very slowly at first, though I was slick from arousal and the shared fluids from our last bout of fucking.</p><p>\u201cI missed you,\u201d I told him again, and he groaned, moving into me more forcefully, but with the smoothest strokes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad,\u201d he told me with the softest smile. \u201cI\u2019m relieved that you want more than just the dominant side of me.\u201d</p><p>I wanted so badly right then to tell him that I loved him, but the words wouldn\u2019t form past the lump in my throat. I kissed him instead, gripping my hands in his silky hair and pulling him down to me.</p><p>He seemed pleased with that, kissing me back with a moan. His thrusts increased into that steady pounding that he\u2019d taught me to love, and I melted under him, an exquisite orgasm building inside of me. I cried out into his mouth as I came, and he joined me, his own cries just as loud, just as desperate, as mine had been.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re mine,\u201d he told me, but it was a tender admission that time.</p><p>He crushed me under him when we\u2019d finished, as though he didn\u2019t even have the energy to roll off of me, when he was the most inexhaustible of men. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I didn\u2019t complain, even though it was a bit of a struggle to breath like that. But I liked his weight on top of me. I relished it. When he did finally roll off of me, it was only to lay plastered to my side, a heavy arm thrown over me.</p><p>We didn\u2019t speak for long minutes, and I felt a sleepy fog invading my senses. But something was nagging at me, a persistent thought that I wanted to clear between us before exhaustion took me.</p><p>\u201cDo you feel used by me?\u201d I asked him suddenly.</p><p>He rose on an elbow to meet my eyes squarely. His studied mine, looking sad. It made me feel a little sad just to see it.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d he said after a long pause. \u201cI worry that you don\u2019t care for me, not like I care for you. I worry that you aren\u2019t able to return my feelings. And I realize that, for the first time in my life, I would let you use me, however you wanted, if it came to that. If that\u2019s all I could get from you, I would take it.\u201d</p><p>I stroked his cheek, feeling an almost uncontrollable need to reassure him. \u201cI do care for you. It scares me sometimes, the way I feel.\u201d My voice was a whisper. It was all I could manage.</p><p>His eyes closed and he pressed his cheek into my hand, looking relieved but still almost anguished, all at once. It was hard to look at him, his face was so raw with emotions.</p><p>\u201cThen live with me,\u201d he said softly. \u201cBe with me. Swear you\u2019ll never leave me.\u201d</p><p>I sighed heavily, but I knew him well enough to know that he couldn\u2019t help but be so demanding. I\u2019d given him a confession of sorts, and it was his first and strongest instinct to press forward and use it to his advantage. I had known, just known, that he would. When I gave, he took more, it was what both drew me to him, and terrified me about him.</p> <p>\u201cWe need to be rational adults about this, James. Let\u2019s start by trying to be together, trying to spend time together, when we can. I think that\u2019s a good start. So, yes to the \u2018be with you\u2019 part. We\u2019ll see on the rest.\u201d</p><p>He arranged me against him for sleep, spooning me from behind, both of us lying on our sides how we slept. \u201cMove in with me. We\u2019ll be traveling so much that I\u2019m not sure you\u2019ll notice the difference, but say you\u2019ll live with me. Just give me that much, and I\u2019ll relent from pressing you for more, for the moment.\u201d</p><p>Shockingly, his persistence actually just made me smile. That\u2019s when I knew that I was well and truly sated. Or perhaps that was just an excuse for my sudden weakness. I made a conscious effort not to analyze it to death, and just thought about his request. What would it mean, to live together? It wasn\u2019t a permanent step, right? I could always withdraw, if I panicked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m keeping my house. I worked my ass off for that house, and I\u2019m keeping it,\u201d I told him, shocked even as the words left my mouth, because I knew how he would take them, and it was, amazingly, actually how I meant them.</p><p>His arms squeezed me almost painfully from behind. \u201cOf course. We can stay there when we\u2019re in Las Vegas. Whatever you want. I\u2019ll sell the other house in Vegas, if you prefer, though we should probably keep it for the stables, if you want to keep riding.\u201d</p><p>I felt such a relief at my own acquiescence, at the world of relief that I heard in his voice and felt in his body, that it floored me. I had wanted this just as much as he had, I realized. I just hadn\u2019t allowed myself to admit it.</p> <p>\u201cI do want to keep riding,\u201d was all I said.</p><p>\u201cYes. Thank you, Bianca. You make me so happy. I never knew life could be like this,\u201d he murmured into my hair. His voice was thick, as though with tears. I wasn\u2019t brave enough to look back and see.</p><p>\u201cSo now you can\u2019t propose, or do anything else crazy, since you said you\u2019d relent if I agreed to live with you.\u201d</p><p>He stiffened slightly as I spoke, and I was right there with him. My words had been a joke, because of course he wouldn\u2019t propose, but they had made him tense up. That made me tense up.</p><p>\u201cHow long do I have to wait, then?\u201d he asked, his tone earnest. \u201cGive me a time frame, and I\u2019ll respect it.\u201d</p><p>The word \u2018forever\u2019 wanted to shoot out of my mouth, but I counted to ten, trying not to panic. \u201cI can\u2019t give you a time frame, James. I can\u2019t even talk about it without having a panic attack. Let\u2019s just enjoy the living together part, ok?\u201d</p><p>He nuzzled against my hair, burrowing deep until he\u2019d moved all the way into my neck. He kissed me there. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk about it another time. I\u2019ll give you time to grow accustomed to the idea.\u201d</p><p>My exhausted body began to drift off, but not before I had the clear thought that he had somehow managed to get me to agree to one huge concession and still insisted on gaining some ground on yet another.</p> <p>Impossible, dominant man.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT</p><p>I blinked awake slowly. James was still spooned tightly behind me. And he had apparently been the thing that woke me up, as he murmured softly into my ear. He was saying sweet little things, an apology in his soft tone. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, my love. I\u2019d let you sleep longer, I\u2019d stay like this forever if I could, but I have to go to this thing, and I can\u2019t bring myself to leave you. Please wake up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m awake,\u201d I told him in a voice rusty from sleep.</p><p>He kissed my hair. \u201cGood.\u201d He sat up, slipping away.</p><p>I made a loud sound of protest at his absence.</p><p>He laughed, and it was a carefree, happy sound.</p><p>I felt my face soften, my whole body softened, and a tender smile took over my face. Hearing such a happy sound come out of James made me happy. How not? I couldn\u2019t imagine being immune to him.</p><p>I sat up sluggishly, watching him stride naked to the door of the bedroom. I was naked myself, and couldn\u2019t even bring myself to cover up as I sat up, sitting cross-legged and just watching him move.</p><p>He opened the door, bent down and picked up a large covered tray. He shut the door again with his foot, carrying the tray to a large heavy dresser and setting it on top. He took off the lid, picking up two large plates and moving back to the bed. He handed me one, sitting close to me, cross-legged, to dig into his own.</p><p>It was a small portion of lightly seasoned salmon with a small cucumber ginger salad on the side. James scarfed it down in a few large bites, and I didn\u2019t take much longer to finish mine.</p><p>\u201cThis feels decadent, eating in your bed,\u201d I told him between bites.</p><p>He took my plate from me, smiling. He fed me the last few bites himself. \u201cOur bed, love. Everything is ours now, remember.\u201d</p><p>I gave him an arch look. That was something I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d ever really agree with. What was his was his. I felt no ownership for any of it, and couldn\u2019t imagine a time when I would. But I knew it was pointless to argue with him, and I really wasn\u2019t in the mood to, so I kept my silence.</p><p>James discarded our cleaned plates on the tray, covering it and shoving it back out of the room.</p><p>He dragged me into the bathroom, and then the shower, speaking more to me with smiles than words. He washed me as he washed himself, as though I was an extension of him. He even shampooed our hair at the same time, lathering my hair and then his. It was a strange thing, having someone tend to me like that, but I knew it was his preference, and I was growing to love it, as I loved everything he did to me.</p><p>He even lathered up my underarms and legs, shaving me expertly, bending down under the showers hard spray, without a qualm, to shave my legs. He even had and used the razor I preferred. The man didn\u2019t miss a trick.</p><p>It was a quick shower, though it felt luxurious. He toweled us both dry afterwards, touching all of the marks he\u2019d made on my body as he did so. He had insisted on leaving my choker on, even to shower, and he dried it carefully and thoroughly.</p><p>His eyes were enigmatic. If I read him right, he both loved and hated the marks he\u2019d made on my body.</p><p>The angry little marks both fascinated and worried him. He pulled me to the bed, laying me down to rub nearly every inch of me with a creamy lotion.</p><p>\u201cThis is not the thing to start if you want us to leave your house tonight,\u201d I told him rather breathlessly.</p><p>He smiled wickedly. \u201cThis is actually me not starting anything. And it\u2019s our house.\u201d</p><p>Impossible man.</p><p>He even dressed me, though not in much. He slid me into a tiny black thong, a strapless black bra, and a very short, very sheer black slip. He put on the large diamond hoop earrings that matched my collar.</p><p>\u201cDid you see the changes I made to our room since the last time you saw it?\u201d James asked as he pulled the slip over my head. He pulled on a pair of low slung black athletic shorts, his chest bare.</p><p>I glanced around. I hadn\u2019t noticed much of anything since I\u2019d come to his house. I had been more than a little distracted, with eyes only for James.</p><p>I saw my paintings almost immediately, once I started looking. He had two of my self-portraits beautifully framed and hanging facing his bed. I didn\u2019t know how I hadn\u2019t seen them before then. They were the most conspicuous pictures on his wall, positioned for a clear view from his bed.</p><p>\u201cThey kept me company when I was missing you. Your larger self portrait is hanging above our fireplace in the main living space downstairs. The others are in the bedrooms of our other properties.</p><p>And the nude is in our playground.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t see it,\u201d I told him. That was understandable, I supposed, since I\u2019d been blindfolded for most of our activities.</p><p>\u201cYou will next time. And I replaced the mattress and all of the bedding. You said you didn\u2019t want me to replace the beds, so as you see, they stayed. Also, if you didn\u2019t notice, most of the playground was redone.\u201d</p><p>I took some deep breaths, trying to process his actions. It was all very sweet, and my heart felt like it was twisting in my chest to think of all he had done for me, but my first instinct was to panic.</p><p>I counted and breathed and tried to react calmly and reasonably. \u201cThat was very thoughtful, James. You didn\u2019t have to do all of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to. We need to get moving. First, we\u2019re meeting with the dresser so you can pick out a dress.</p><p>You\u2019ll get your hair and makeup done while she makes any adjustments that might be needed.\u201d As he spoke, he pulled me from the room.</p><p>I dug in my heels almost immediately. \u201cYou aren\u2019t wearing a shirt. There are people in the house?</p><p>You\u2019ll give someone a heart attack like that, James.\u201d</p><p>He completely ignored me, and I got quickly distracted as I caught a glimpse of the tattoo on his back. It was still so shocking to me, and so lovely. A thought occurred to me. \u201cAre you just showing off your new tats to anyone you can?\u201d</p><p>He flashed me a grin. It didn\u2019t tell me much of anything. He was just happy in general, and he wasn\u2019t putting a shirt on anytime soon.</p><p>We stayed on the third floor, but walked down the long hallway. He pulled me into the room closest to the stairs. It was a very sparsely furnished guest bedroom decorated in blue. There were racks of dresses everywhere, nearly overwhelming the large room.</p><p>\u201cJames, is that you?\u201d a voice called from what must have been the closet.</p><p>\u201cYes, Jackie,\u201d he called back. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A small, black-haired woman walked out of the closet, clutching hangers full of colorful dresses in each hand. She grinned at us.</p><p>She was beautiful, with sleek, long black hair pulled back from her stunning face. Her dark eyes were almond shaped and vibrant, with heavy violet eye shadow that brought out her olive skin to perfection.</p><p>Her lips were pure crimson and the shade suited her coloring. She was one of those people who could have been just about any race, but whatever it was, it was lovely.</p><p>She wore cute little eyeglasses on her nose that were so attractive that you had to wonder if they were just a fashion statement, or if she really required them. She wore an impeccably fitted emerald green sheath with a bright blue belt. Her shoes were five inch stilettos and hot pink. She wore a necklace of deep jewel-toned stones, with heavy gold hoops in her ears. Both of her wrists were heavy with intricate metal bangles.</p> <p>She looked fashionable and intimidating, and though the outfit somehow worked beautifully, I could tell at a glance that she was a woman who wasn\u2019t afraid to try and fail at fashion. I was betting that she would think that not trying was the only way to fail. Her outfit was timeless elegance but still managed to be trendy. I was impressed. I would have been happy to achieve either of those things. It was ambitious to try for both.</p><p>She eyed me up and down without shame as James introduced me. \u201cJackie, this is Bianca. Bianca, Jackie. She\u2019s responsible for all of the new additions to your wardrobe.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at me rather expectantly. \u201cWhat do you think? It\u2019s okay if you hate it all. I just need feedback, so I can get an idea of what you do like. James here is my favorite client of all time. He lets me dress him however I like. Can you imagine? It\u2019s every stylists dream, a supermodel of a client who will wear damn near anything I pick out.\u201d She eyed me critically as she spoke, as though mentally taking my measurements. She even began to circle me. I thought she was a strange little woman.</p><p>\u201cI, uh, haven\u2019t had much of a chance to look at it.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, pursing her lips. \u201cWell, when you do, any feedback would be good. It will give me some direction for your sense of style.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBianca likes the preppy look for men, Jackie,\u201d James told her. \u201cKeep that in mind when you\u2019re shopping for me as well.\u201d</p><p>She snorted. \u201cAnd so it begins.\u201d She sounded very put out by his request. \u201cI\u2019ll keep it in mind.\u201d</p><p>I shot him a baffled look. Where did he come up with this stuff?</p><p>He shrugged at me, smiling a little. \u201cYou forget that Stephan and I talk.\u201d</p><p>She was still circling me, studying me rather unnervingly. \u201cJames had you right on, size-wise. A size 5/6 in the waist and hips, and a 7/8 in the bust and shoulders. You have a body that\u2019s fun for men to play with, but not too fun to dress. Your legs are a plus, though. There\u2019s nothing I love to dress more than a killer set of legs. If you lost about ten pounds, though, you could have model proportions. That would be ideal. Something to think about.\u201d</p><p>Some part of me agreed with her about the need to lose ten pounds, but it still stung to hear it. It was petty, but I had gone from kind of liking her to thinking she was awful in a few short sentences.</p> <p>\u201cJackie,\u201d James said, a cool warning in his voice. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t need to lose a pound. If you talk her into a diet, I will fire you.\u201d</p><p>She just grinned, uncaring about the warning and my stiff expression. \u201cOkay, okay, just a mild suggestion.\u201d</p><p>She laid the colorful armfuls of fabric onto the bed. \u201cBased on your body type and skin tone, I picked out five dresses that I thought had the best shot of suiting you. Try them on, if you please, or anything else you see that catches your fancy.\u201d She seemed to dismiss me completely after she finished speaking, approaching James with wide eyes.</p><p>She stabbed the red ink on his chest. \u201cWhen did this happen? It has to be brand new!\u201d</p><p>He just grinned, turning to show her his back. She was struck speechless at the sight.</p><p>I turned my back on them, grabbing the dresses on the bed and heading into the closet to try them on, while they continued to chat.</p><p>You wouldn\u2019t have known it was a guest room if you were going by the closet. It was the size of a guest room all by itself, with mirrors lining every wall. I assumed this was the room where he usually worked with Jackie, going by the clothing, both male and female, lining the walls, tags intact.</p><p>I hung Jackie\u2019s choices on a bare stretch of racks, eyeing them up dubiously. They were gowns. I liked skirts and sundresses well enough if they were cool and comfortable, but I felt overwhelmed even trying on the gowns I was looking at now.</p> <p>I took a deep breath, plunging in. I wouldn\u2019t let someone like Jackie see that I was intimidated by the clothes, or any of it, for that matter.</p><p>I grabbed a plain navy gown first. I could see by the cut of the top half that I wouldn\u2019t be wearing a slip with it, so I slipped out of it before working the silky material over my legs, hips, and finally my bust. It was a strapless gown, with a long slit up the side. It zipped in back, and I couldn\u2019t manage on my own. I almost took it off just because of that, but with a sigh, I stepped out of the closet to get a hand.</p><p>Jackie was still studying James\u2019s shoulder tattoo when I stepped out of the closet. He shot me a admiring smile. \u201cThat looks great.\u201d</p><p>I gave him a rather weak smile. The more I got ready for the gala, the more I felt a little overwhelmed by my misgivings. This was not my world, I didn\u2019t want it to be, and I didn\u2019t know if I could fake it, even for James.</p><p>\u201cCan you zip me?\u201d I asked him, my voice very stiff. He did, after all, have a strange woman running her fingers along his back.</p><p>He moved to me, completely ignoring Jackie\u2019s demand for him to hold still. He held the back together, zipping me in with more ease than I would have expected. The dress didn\u2019t have a bit of give in the silken fabric, and I\u2019d thought it would be tighter.</p><p>I turned to the huge mirror mounted on the wall, approaching it to eye the gown with a critical eye.</p><p>James followed me, watching my face more than anything. I thought he could sense my uncertainty.</p><p>I thought the dress looked nice enough. \u201cIt fits,\u201d I said flatly. \u201cAnd it\u2019s actually long enough. That\u2019s pretty impressive, I suppose.\u201d</p><p>Jackie made a little humming sound in her throat. \u201cThey make them long like that, for heels. Looks like you\u2019ll need at least a three inch heel to pull that one off. It fits well enough. A little plain, but it fits.\u201d</p><p>I headed back into the closet, biting back a comment about the fact that she had been the one to pick the thing out.</p><p>I chose a pretty lavender gown next. The top was a halter, and it didn\u2019t take long to realize that I couldn\u2019t wear a bra with the neckline.</p><p>I usually wouldn\u2019t be caught dead going braless in public, but I tried it on, just to see. The way it tied gave the top a surprising amount of support in the bust area, and the silk was soft against my skin.</p><p>It was fitted, but not tight, from neck to about mid hip, where it fanned out in fluffy layers of chiffon, a high slit showing a lot of one leg. Jackie liked her high slitted gowns. It was ultra-feminine but still sexy, and I loved it instantly.</p><p>James blinked at me as I walked out, his jaw going just a touch slack. I was gratified. I decided instantly to wear the dress. Jackie\u2019s input be damned.</p><p>Jackie whistled. \u201cVery nice. I almost want to save that one for a bigger event.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019ll wear it tonight,\u201d I told her. I needed all of the confidence boosting I could get for the night, and James looking at me the way he was looking at me did exactly that.</p><p>He swallowed, then licked his lips. All of his nervous tells. It made me smile.</p><p>\u201cYou look beautiful,\u201d he said, with feeling. \u201cBut it seems a little revealing. Do you think it\u2019ll pick up as see-through with the camera flashes, Jackie?\u201d</p><p>She gave him a \u2018do you think I\u2019m an amateur?\u2019 kind of look. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be in the pile if it did.\u201d She turned back to me, her voice brisk. \u201cNow to accessorize. You can go start getting dressed yourself, James. I got this.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE</p><p>Jackie pointed me in the direction of shiny navy wedges with a peep toe and a four inch heel. They were more comfortable than they looked, though that wasn\u2019t saying much.</p><p>\u201cDoes the navy go with the lavender?\u201d I asked dubiously.</p><p>She gave me a very exasperated look. \u201cWould I pair them if they didn\u2019t? And James is wearing this amazing all navy tux. It\u2019s very fashion forward. Only a supermodel like James could pull it off. And he mentioned that he likes you guys to match, so I think he\u2019ll like the shoes.</p><p>Eyeing myself up in the mirror, I had to agree that the shoes went well. I would have never guessed the the dress would pop even more with shiny navy shoes, but I was no stylist.</p><p>She sighed, looking at my jewelry. \u201cJames obviously wants you wearing that choker and earrings.</p><p>While they\u2019re lovely, I had other accessories in mind for that dress. Oh well. Sometimes I must compromise my vision. A girl\u2019s got to eat.\u201d As she finished speaking, James was striding back into the room, a jewelry box in his hands. He was still shirtless. He set it on the bed without a word, just smiling as he strode back out.</p><p>Jackie sighed again, opening the box. Her eyes widened. She shot me a speculative glance. She took two thick diamond studded cuffs out of the box, walking to me. She snapped them on my wrists, making no comments about the abrasions that they covered. She circled me, pursing her lips as she tugged at several spots on my dress, adjusting it just so.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t need alteration, since you\u2019re so damned tall, so that saves time.\u201d She grabbed a smooth white robe off of a rack, holding it up for me. \u201cSo you don\u2019t mess up the dress while you get hair and makeup done. We have a minute to talk.\u201d</p><p>I thought that sounded ominous, but I met her gaze squarely.</p><p>She arched a brow at me. \u201cJames and I go way back. We went to school together. I\u2019m his stylist, but it\u2019s not because I need the money. I love fashion, but I come from money myself. I\u2019ve had to dodge my fare share of fortune-hunters, but it\u2019s nothing compared to what James has to deal with.\u201d</p><p>She eyed me from top to bottom, but it only made my spine straighten. \u201cYou\u2019re attractive enough, but I must admit, I don\u2019t get it. Is your vagina gold plated? He\u2019s been chased by supermodels and playboy bunnies. He fucked a lot of them, hell, most of them, but he never even talked about having a girlfriend.</p><p>Not once. Now you\u2019ve moved in with him, and he\u2019s acting like he\u2019s a one woman man for life all of a sudden. I\u2019ll admit, I\u2019m intrigued and mystified by the change in him, but I don\u2019t understand any of it. How did you wrap him around your little finger, Bianca? And how do you feel about him? As one of his few close friends, I\u2019d like to know your intentions.\u201d</p><p>I returned her narrowed gaze with an icy one of my own. If I\u2019d had any doubts before, I knew it now; Jackie and I were not going to be friends.</p><p>\u201cIf you and James are such close friends,\u201d I began coldly, \u201cyou should be having this conversation with him, not me. You\u2019re a virtual stranger to me. I won\u2019t be discussing my feelings, or my intentions, with you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She just sighed, as though I\u2019d disappointed her. \u201cI was too direct, wasn\u2019t I? Now you don\u2019t trust me.</p><p>I\u2019m blunt, Bianca, but we don\u2019t have to be enemies.\u201d</p><p>I just gave a little shrug, wanting to end the awkward and personal conversation as quickly as possible.</p><p>\u201cHair and makeup?\u201d I asked coldly.</p> <p>She sighed again. \u201cFollow me. They\u2019ve set up a room for it.\u201d</p><p>She led me to a large room one floor down. It had glass walls, and I thought it must have been some sort of entertainment room before they\u2019d taken it over. There was a huge flatscreen TV mounted on the wall, and several reclining chairs pushed up against the wall, as though to make room for the salon-like setup.</p><p>Two ladies were waiting and chatting, looking antsy as we entered the room. There was a barber shop chair set up in front of a a table loaded with hair products and cosmetics. It was intimidating to imagine the setup was all for my benefit.</p><p>A thin, dark-haired girl strode towards me, smiling. Her heavy chestnut hair hung in waves nearly to her waist. Her nose dominated her thin face, but in an attractive kind of way. It was somehow a distinctive nose, rather than just large. Her big, dark eyes helped. And her artfully applied makeup, with smoky eyes and plum colored lips.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Amy,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll be doing your makeup. It\u2019s very nice to meet you, Ms. Karlsson.\u201d</p> <p>I shook her hand, thinking that her amiable approach had to be the polar opposite of Jackie\u2019s. \u201cNice to meet you, Amy. Please, call me Bianca.\u201d</p><p>The second woman stepped forward, her smile just as friendly as Amy\u2019s. \u201cI\u2019m Ariel. I\u2019ll be doing your hair. Nice to finally meet you, Ms. Karlsson.\u201d</p><p>I shook her hand, smiling. The friendly women were already helping me shake off the awkwardness that was Jackie. \u201cBianca, please. Nice to meet you, as well.\u201d</p><p>They sat me in the chair, tripping over each other to discuss my hair and makeup, then giggling at each other. They were obviously friends.</p><p>I made it easy on them. \u201cYou\u2019re the experts. I trust your judgement, so fix me up however you think is best.\u201d I\u2019d never spared much time or thought on my appearance, and I didn\u2019t intend to let my strange new lifestyle change that.</p><p>This seemed to please them both, and they set to work. I closed my eyes, just letting them. They worked on me, blowdrying my hair, and applying my makeup for maybe ten minutes before I felt James enter the room. Both women paused for scant moments before resuming their ministrations. I guessed that he\u2019d waved them back to their work, sitting somewhere to watch. I felt Ariel begin to play with my hair, pulling it back and twisting it.</p> <p>\u201cLeave her hair down,\u201d James said from somewhere to my right.</p><p>Ariel let it fall without a word, smoothing it out.</p><p>James wasn\u2019t quiet for a full minute before speaking again. \u201cAre you ignoring me, Love?\u201d</p><p>Impatient man. \u201cIf you didn\u2019t notice, Amy is applying makeup to my face. I\u2019m trying to hold still.\u201d</p><p>He made a little noise of displeasure in his throat.</p><p>\u201cYou can open your eyes, Bianca. I can work around it,\u201d Amy told me. I could tell she was just trying to appease James, since I could still feel her working on my eyelids.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I\u2019ll hold still until you\u2019re done,\u201d I told her.</p><p>It was maybe thirty seconds before James spoke again. \u201cDid you like the cuffs?\u201d he asked me.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re lovely. Thank you,\u201d I told him.</p><p>Amy and Ariel began to ooh and ah over my diamond jewelry. \u201cThat is luxe. Who did you borrow from? You\u2019ll need a bodyguard for this kind of jewelry.\u201d Ariel\u2019s voice was awed.</p><p>James answered for me, but I felt my cheeks redden. I had tried very hard not to think about how much the jewelry he gave me was worth, but her comment made it harder to ignore.</p><p>\u201cI actually had it all designed for her,\u201d James told them. \u201cIt\u2019s her own personal collection.\u201d</p><p>More oohs and ahs. \u201cWhat a generous boyfriend,\u201d Amy said, her voice dreamy.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s nothing. I haven\u2019t even begun to gift her with my mother\u2019s jewels. She left me a queen\u2019s ransom\u2019s worth,\u201d James said, a clear grin in his voice.</p><p>I thought the two women were going to swoon as they rushed to tell him how wonderful he was. He was wonderful, but I couldn\u2019t bring myself to be pleased with the prospect of more extravagant gifts. They still just made me uncomfortable. And if he wasn\u2019t joking, if he really did intend to give me some of the jewels his mother had left him, well, that was even more disconcerting. It seemed like such a huge step.</p><p>You didn\u2019t give a woman things with such sentimental value unless she was your wife, or you were certain that she would be. The thought still made my blood run cold. Would he really push this issue so soon after I had agreed to live with him? I still couldn\u2019t believe we were moving so incredibly fast, and yet he only wanted more. I tried not to panic at the thought.</p><p>\u201cShe even left me her five-carat princess cut diamond engagement ring, surrounded by sapphire baguettes. Don\u2019t you ladies think that would look particularly lovely on Bianca\u2019s left hand?\u201d</p><p>I felt myself get a little light-headed, but the ladies went crazy, gushing over how romantic he was. I told myself, rather desperately, that he was only joking, that he was just having fun at our expense, but I was beginning to know him well enough to be worried.</p><p>\u201cJust take deep breaths, Love. You\u2019ll grow accustomed to the idea, once the initial shock wears off,\u201d</p><p>James told me, his tone rather casual considering the topic matter.</p><p>The ladies giggled, as though he were joking. If only.</p><p>\u201cJames,\u201d I began.</p><p>\u201cDeep breaths,\u201d he said again, the clear smile in his voice infuriating. But I took a few deep breaths, and it did help a little.</p><p>Amy and Ariel finished my hair and makeup within seconds of each other, almost as though they had it down to a science. They seemed to be used to working together, so I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if that was the case.</p><p>\u201cThank you, ladies,\u201d James said, his voice a touch husky.</p><p>I knew that tone. It wasn\u2019t fit for company. It was way too tender and affected for that.</p><p>\u201cYou can open your eyes, Bianca. Tell us what you think. We can change anything you don\u2019t like,\u201d Amy said, her voice endearingly earnest.</p><p>I looked. I was...stunned. I looked more lovely than I had thought makeup could make me. My eyes were lined in a soft brown, my lashes sooty and black. My lids were a pale lavender near the brows, with a more vibrant violet along my lashes. The color brought out my eyes startlingly, the liner making them look huge in my rounded face. Just a touch of bronzer on my cheeks had me glowing, and a soft, shiny pink lip made my lips look plump and kissable. My hair was straight and smooth, the short bangs working with the makeup to bring out my pale aquamarine eyes.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d I managed to get out.</p><p>\u201cExquisite,\u201d James murmured.</p><p>My eyes traveled to him when he spoke. He had turned one of the reclining chairs towards me, and was lounging in it comfortably, one perfectly tailored leg crossed over a knee, shiny navy shoes gleaming in the light. They were the mens version of my shoes. I knew he\u2019d get a kick out of that, if he hadn\u2019t noticed already. Hell, I got a bit of a kick out of it. He looked amazing, of course. Jackie had been right about his tux being fashion forward. It was sleek and navy, more fitted than a normal tux, showing off his stark muscular build to perfection. Even his sleek dress shirt and bow tie were a dark navy that caught the light a bit more than the rest of the ensemble. It was something you would normally only see on a runway at fashion week, because no one who wasn\u2019t a damned supermodel could pull it off. The dark navy set off his dark tan, his turquoise eyes shining vibrantly against the dark contrasts. His hair was slicked back just a tad.</p><p>I pointed at him. \u201cDid it really only take you ten minutes to look like that? That is so unfair.\u201d</p><p>He looked at his watch. It wasn\u2019t one I\u2019d seen before. I had quickly caught on that he liked to collect watches. Expensive ones, of course. \u201cLove, it only took you forty-five minutes, so you can\u2019t really complain, either. That\u2019s unheard of for a red carpet event.\u201d</p><p>I waved a hand at the women hovering behind me. \u201cIt took a team to get me ready that fast, Mr.</p><p>Beautiful.\u201d</p><p>Amy and Ariel giggled at the name.</p><p>James smirked. \u201cEvery woman attending tonight had a team getting them ready, love, and I guarantee that no one other than you only took forty-five minutes, team or no.\u201d</p><p>James politely dismissed my \u2018team\u2019 of beautifiers, and I thanked them again.</p><p>When we were finally alone, he pulled me to my feet, whipping off the white robe that protected my gown. His eyes were hot as he just stared at me, studying me from head to toe. He smiled when he saw our matching patent-leather navy shoes.</p><p>\u201cI take it you like me all dolled up like this. Are you going to try to have those two follow me around to achieve the affect more often?\u201d I asked him, only half-teasing. There was no telling what the crazy man would do.</p><p>He ran his tongue over his teeth, a gesture that always drove me wild. \u201cTo tell you the truth, I like you best bare of makeup and everything else. I\u2019ve never met a woman who looked more beautiful without a thing on. But I have to admit that I love the idea of shoving you in the face of the press when you look so polished and lovely, and when they\u2019ve printed so many unflattering things about you. It will make them all look like fools, after some of the nonsense that\u2019s been posted.\u201d</p><p>I gave a little shrug. I really couldn\u2019t let the things being said about me get to me, or I\u2019d never leave my house again. I thought that it was a little naive for James to think that he could change anyone\u2019s mind after the things that had been said about him. I certainly wouldn\u2019t be holding my breath.</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTY</p><p>Jackie reappeared as we were almost to the elevator, handing me a tiny navy patent-leather clutch. It was cute, but I hated having something on me that would take up the use of my hand for the entire night, so I declined. She looked baffled by the refusal, looking at the clutch in her hand as though it had done something to warrant the rejection.</p><p>I looked at James. \u201cDo I need to take anything?\u201d</p><p>He considered. \u201cOnly what you would consider essential. If you don\u2019t have anything you want to bring, then you certainly don\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it completes the ensemble!\u201d Jackie said.</p><p>I just looked at her. If she was paying attention, she could have seen in my eyes that I just didn\u2019t care that much about \u2018completing the ensemble\u2019. She finally got the idea, moving out of our way, though the look she gave me was less than friendly.</p><p>\u201cWill you be attending tonight?\u201d James asked her as he led me into the elevator by a hand on the small of my back.</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI may come to hound the red carpet press about who I dressed tonight. Free publicity and all that.\u201d</p><p>James just nodded, pushing the button.</p><p>Jackie hurried into the car. She seemed to have just realized that she was leaving, too. She pushed the button for the fifteenth floor. She saw my look. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI live in this building, as well,\u201d she explained.</p><p>Well, that was handy, I thought.</p><p>She got off on her floor with a dismissive little wave.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think of Jackie?\u201d James asked as soon as the door closed.</p> <p>I gave him my little shrug that drove him crazy. I was going for nonchalant, but I ruined it with a dumb question. \u201cHave you slept with her?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t get offended, as most men probably would. He never seemed to mind my inquiries about his past affairs. He didn\u2019t like my questions, but he seemed ever willing to give me answers. I appreciated his candor, even if I didn\u2019t always like his answers.</p><p>\u201cI have not. We have always been strictly platonic, and we\u2019ve been friends since high school. So what did you think of her?\u201d</p><p>I grimaced a little, but not so he could see it. \u201cI\u2019m trying hard to reserve judgement, at the moment. She told me you\u2019ve been friends for a long time, but she seems to be nurturing a vague dislike for me. The feeling is very much mutual, so far.\u201d</p><p>His hand gripped my hip almost painfully. \u201cWhy? What did she say to you?\u201d</p> <p>I shot him a look. \u201cShe thinks I\u2019m after your money, I guess. It\u2019s what you can expect everyone to be thinking and saying. I\u2019ll have to get used to that kind of nonsense, I suppose.\u201d</p><p>He used the tight grip on my hip to push my other side into his rigid stomach. He spoke very close to my ear, as though we weren\u2019t alone in the elevator. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to put up with that. We can fire her.</p><p>You can fire anyone who doesn\u2019t suit you, for any reason.\u201d</p><p>I placed a hand on his chest, right on his heart, where my name was branded. I looked up into his beloved eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s not necessary. You\u2019ve obviously been able to maintain a good working relationship with her over the years. Maybe just don\u2019t have her shop for me anymore. I don\u2019t want anything else, anyways. It\u2019s all too much, James.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will have a word with her, Bianca. If she disrespects you again, I\u2019m firing her. She will get a clear warning, but only one.\u201d</p><p>I rubbed that sweet little spot on his chest. \u201cPeople will be thinking that, James. We need to be prepared for it. It\u2019s a conversation that I will undoubtedly be having again and again. There\u2019s no way for me to prove to the world that I don\u2019t want a damned cent from you.\u201d</p> <p>We arrived at the lobby floor, and he hugged me into his side, a hand going to the hoop at my collar to hook in that familiar finger as we made our way through the swank lobby and to the waiting town car. In the scant space from the building\u2019s doorway to the car, three flashbulbs snapped at us just getting into the car. James ushered me in without a word, crowding in behind me. I scooted across the seat to give him room, but he just followed me, plastering me to his side as the door closed behind him.</p><p>He kissed the skin just behind my ear as he spoke. \u201cAnd yet, it\u2019s all yours, love. Every damned cent. I want to lay the world at your feet. There\u2019s nothing I wouldn\u2019t do for you. You know that, right?\u201d</p><p>I rubbed my hands over him comfortingly, hearing a strange vulnerability in his voice. I stroked his knee, and found my favorite spot on his heart, running my hand over it again and again. \u201cI don\u2019t need any of that, James. I\u2019ve grown to need you. I love your honesty, and your tenderness, and your dominance.\u201d</p><p>I took a deep breath, suddenly panicky about the things coming out of my mouth. I had never said anything quite so revealing to him before. \u201cBut I don\u2019t need any of that other stuff,\u201d I said firmly.</p><p>\u201cNonetheless, you have it,\u201d he murmured, burying his face in my neck. He began to suckle me there, and I melted. He pulled back abruptly. \u201cI don\u2019t want to muss you up for your first red carpet.\u201d</p><p>I was breathless when I responded. \u201cAt least I\u2019m not nervous now. I can\u2019t even remember why I should care enough to be nervous. I only care about getting you to touch me again.\u201d</p><p>He threw his head back and laughed. It was his happy laugh, and I felt my whole body get soft, my smile as our eyes met unmistakably tender. I didn\u2019t think there was much I wouldn\u2019t do to make him that happy.</p><p>And yet I had done so little to make him so. It seemed miraculous to me that my every small gesture seemed to affect him so.</p> <p>He was still giving me that boyish smile as the car stopped. The gala was apparently very close to his home.</p><p>James handed me out of the car expertly, his hand falling swiftly to my waist. He ushered me through the press as though it were a dance, the cameras snapping at us in quick succession. I plastered my most polished smile on my face. It was a photo-ready smile, if a touch cool. I had perfected it at a young age.</p><p>Growing up fast and painfully had taught me that smile. Yes, it was polished, but I had earned that polish.</p><p>A few photographers shouted out some rather rude comments, but we both ignored them. They were acting that way for a reaction, and it was the last thing I would give them. My smile never even slipped.</p><p>James kissed my forehead when we finally made our way into the grand entrance of the building.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a natural. Those bloodhounds can take some getting used to.\u201d</p><p>My mind had already moved past the strange red carpet experience when I saw a doorway into some kind of elaborate ballroom. \u201cOh, James, I don\u2019t know how to dance. I didn\u2019t even think of it.\u201d</p><p>He kissed my forehead again, and I caught the edge of his smile at the top of my vision. \u201cYou only need to dance with me, Love. And we know all too well that if I lead, you know how to follow, even without experience.\u201d</p><p>I tried to tell myself that he may well be right. Perhaps it would just be that easy. I felt the nerves clench in my stomach nonetheless.</p><p>A seemingly endless stream of introductions and polite mingling began almost immediately. I gathered from some of the pleasantries exchanged that this was a gala that his mother had been involved with before she\u2019d passed. She had made the charity rounds, I learned, donating generous amounts of both her time and money. James had mentioned briefly that it was a fundraiser for cancer research at a prominent New York hospital. I tried to say the right things when addressed, but I felt quickly out of my depth. I had never been to anything like the gala before, and I was overwhelmed by all of the affluent company I was suddenly keeping. It was daunting, to say the least.</p><p>James, for his part, was a perfect date for such an event, including me in conversations that really had nothing to do with me, and keeping a warm hand on my hip, often sending warm, reassuring smiles my way. He seemed content just to have me at his side. But I just felt awkward, as though I had no purpose there. The introductions quickly became a blur for me. Most of the people I met hadn\u2019t left enough of an impression to put a face with a name even moments after moving on. There were a few exceptions.</p><p>After mingling for a solid hour, we were approached by the most austere looking woman I had ever seen in my life. She had to be seventy, with silver hair pulled back into a severe bun, and a navy gown that went from her neckline to her toes, the stark lines showing a sparse figure.</p><p>She stood directly in front of us before she spoke. Her tone was icy, her accent crisp and British.</p><p>\u201cJames. And how are you this evening?\u201d</p><p>His eyes were cold as he studied the woman, but the moment he spoke, I detected a note of something I\u2019d never heard from him before. It was almost as if he affected a slightly sneering tone, mimicking her accent just enough to goad her. I watched him in fascination. \u201cAunt Mildred. I am well. And how are you this fine evening?\u201d</p><p>Her brow arched. I thought that to her it may have been a way of answering. She never spared me a glance. \u201cWell enough. I have been hearing things about you, though. Disturbing things. Even more disturbing than your usual debaucheries. Please tell me that you haven\u2019t invited a penniless flight attendant to live in one of your homes.\u201d</p><p>I stiffened, but still couldn\u2019t look away from James. How did everyone seem to know that we had moved in together before it had even happened? I had barely even agreed to the arrangement.</p><p>His eyes began to twinkle, but it wasn\u2019t a good kind of twinkle. It was as though he had engaged this woman in hostile banter too many times to count, and I thought he just might look forward to offending her. \u201cAunt Mildred, meet my girlfriend, Bianca. Bianca, this is my charming Aunt Mildred.\u201d</p><p>The awful woman just slanted me a malevolent stare, giving me a sneer.</p><p>\u201cNow, now, Auntie,\u201d James began in that goading tone, \u201cyou had better play nice with my dearest Bianca. I have not invited her to live in one of my homes. I have welcomed her into all of them. And though I know it would break your heart if anything were to ever happen to me, you will be beholden to this angel to cover your living expenses when I pass away, as she will be my sole inheritor.\u201d</p><p>I shot him a look. I didn\u2019t care for him putting me in the middle of what was obviously a family squabble. I let my eyes tell him as much. He just smiled at me, stroking a finger down my cheek.</p><p>Mildred harrumphed. \u201cI know you like to have your fun at my expense, you rotten boy, but this is going too far. Really, what a ridiculous thing to say. You\u2019ll give the poor chit delusions of grandeur.\u201d</p><p>He stopped smiling, giving her a very serious look. \u201cIt is no joke, Mildred. Meet my future. Her name is Bianca. Come to terms with it. My advice would be to get on her good side.\u201d With that, he led me away.</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE</p><p>He was tense as he led me away. \u201cPlease don\u2019t involve me in that family stuff, James. It makes me horribly uncomfortable.\u201d</p><p>His mouth tightened. \u201cJust handle it with the practicality that you\u2019ve handled the press, Love. My family is fucked up to the Nth degree, and you are now a part of it. Trust me, it\u2019s best to face them all head on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFacing them is different than goading that awful woman with lies about heirs or inheritors.\u201d</p><p>He pursed his lips, studying me. I could tell that he was debating with himself what he should say to me. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a lie, Bianca. You will be inheriting everything, should I pass. I\u2019ve already begun the process.\u201d</p><p>I swayed a little on my feet, feeling suddenly quite light-headed. \u201cPlease don\u2019t, James. Don\u2019t say that, and if you\u2019re so crazy that it\u2019s actually the truth, don\u2019t do it. It is the last thing I want. Your family will despise me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to say that they will despise you regardless. They are a spiteful nest of vipers, and if something should happen to both of us, all of the family wealth will be going to my mother\u2019s favorite charities. I know you will tell me that I am too hasty, that it\u2019s all too sudden, but this is how I do things, Bianca. When I\u2019m certain of something, I am decisive about it.\u201d His eyes were steady on mine as he spoke, and we stared at each for a long moment while I tried to process what he was saying.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t sway me from this,\u201d he continued, \u201cI\u2019m quite set on this course. It only needs to bother you as much as you let it. Go back to pretending that you don\u2019t know, if you need to.\u201d</p><p>I gave him a long, level stare. \u201cYou\u2019re impossible,\u201d I told him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He had the nerve to grin.</p><p>His gaze shot to a spot behind me, and in an instant that grin was gone, replaced by a very careful, very blank mask. It worried me. I didn\u2019t want to see what had bothered him enough to close him off so quickly.</p><p>I turned, a feeling close to dread in my stomach, and sure enough, it was justified. Jules was less than ten feet away, clearly making her way to us through the crush.</p><p>James moved in close to me, tilting his head closer to my ear. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t know she would be here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not avoiding her,\u201d I told him, my eyes never leaving the ravishingly beautiful woman.</p><p>She was stunning in a cream silk gown. Her shoulders were perfect and delicate in the classic sleeveless gown, her skin a perfect dusky shade against the pale silk. My own shoulders were broad and bony and pale. Her cleavage was perfect, showing just enough to be tasteful and sexy. My own cleavage felt vulgar in comparison. Fair or not, I hated her.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s for the best, in general, I suppose,\u201d James said quietly into my ear. \u201cI can see from here, though, that she is determined to start trouble for us. Please, my love, don\u2019t let her get to you.\u201d</p><p>I took deep breaths, not answering. The last time I had seen the woman, I had been devastated by the things she had implied about her relationship with James. If I could trust James, and I was beginning to, this woman had to be close to crazy, planting stories to the press about their fictional romantic love affair. I was bound and determined not to let her ruffle my feathers. She wasn\u2019t worth it, even if she was one of the most beautiful women I\u2019d ever seen. I despised her for that, for being so close to the female counterpart to James\u2019s impossible beauty.</p><p>Jules gave us what appeared to be a truly genuine smile as she drew close. \u201cJames! Bianca! How lovely to see you both.\u201d She air kissed both of our cheeks.</p> <p>Our responses and postures were nearly identical as she leaned close to us both. Stiff and distrustful.</p><p>James held me to him with a hard arm around my waist, his hand snaking to grip my hip firmly. One side of the front of his body pressed into my back.</p><p>I thought resentfully that Jules even smelled divine as she pulled back with a smile on her blood red lips.</p><p>\u201cGive it a rest, Jules. I know about the stories you\u2019ve been planting. Just what did you hope to accomplish with any of it? And bringing her here? What are you doing? Why waste so much energy?</p><p>Just for pure spite? Or are really so addicted to staying in the headlines?\u201d James spoke in a cold, disdainful voice that somehow managed to be bored. Jules\u2019s smile barely slipped, but I sensed how his disdain crushed her as I looked into her gray eyes.</p><p>She\u2019s in love with him, I thought. I shouldn\u2019t have been surprised, all things considered. And of course, the largest consideration was the man himself. Who wouldn\u2019t be in love with him?</p> <p>I hadn\u2019t noticed the second woman until James mentioned her, though it was hard to believe that anyone could overlook the stunning woman. Perhaps it was her size. She was very petite, maybe five feet tall, with curly black hair that hung loose to her waist.</p><p>Her face was devastatingly beautiful. Even Jules was no match for this woman. She had the face of an angel, her eyes a clear blue that stood out on her dusky skin. That dusky skin was nearly the same shade as the woman who stood so close to her side. In fact, their skin tones matched perfectly enough to make me think they could be sisters. Either that, or they\u2019d used the same spray tanner. If so, it was worth every penny.</p><p>She wore a crimson dress that matched her pouty bow-shaped lips. It was a classic style that matched Jules\u2019s gown almost perfectly, down to the silky material, one of them red, one of them white, as though they had planned it. An angel and a devil. They were holding hands, and I knew this woman was trouble for me. Just knew it.</p><p>It was probably the way her focus never wavered from James. As though he had trained her never to look away from him... \u201cBianca, dear, this is Jolene. Jolene, Bianca. I know you were dying to meet her. What do you think?\u201d</p><p>Jules addressed Jolene.</p><p>Jolene shrugged a lovely shoulder, her gaze never leaving James.</p><p>\u201cHello, Mr. Cavendish,\u201d she said softly. Her voice was almost breathy and bled over-the-top sexy vibes across the scant feet separating them.</p><p>I looked at James, almost scared to see his reaction to the stunning woman.</p> <p>He gave her a stiff nod, his eyes cold and unreadable. \u201cJolene.\u201d</p><p>Jules ignored all of the awkwardness, beaming at me as though we were longtime friends. \u201cYou and Jolene have a lot in common, Bianca. I bet you can guess at some of it...\u201d</p><p>The hand on my hip had turned into an absolute death-grip. \u201cWell, we\u2019ve had about enough of the immature games for tonight. Please excuse us, ladies. Ah, perfect. I think I see your brother, Jules.\u201d I got a fleeting glance of the near-panicked expression on Jules\u2019s face as James tugged me away. She was searching the crowd, looking none too happy.</p><p>I didn\u2019t have time to ask James any questions about the odd exchange, and the conclusions I\u2019d drawn, before he was introducing me to a stunning man who I knew at a glance had to be Jules\u2019s brother. They could have been twins, though he was much taller and broader. \u201cBianca, this is my good friend, Parker.</p><p>Parker, this is my Bianca.\u201d</p><p>The man smiled warmly, much as his sister did, though I thought his smile might actually be genuine.</p><p>\u201cSo good to meet you, Bianca. James has instructed me not to scare you off, but I would like to thank you for finally getting him to settle down. My wife and I would love to have you both over for dinner. At your convenience, of course. You should see James with our two-year-old. You\u2019ll get baby fever at a glance, I guarantee it.\u201d</p><p>I was still stiff and upset from the exchange with Jules and Jolene, and this only made me tense up even more. I simply had no idea how to respond to such a statement. Didn\u2019t even know where to begin.</p><p>James just sighed. \u201cThat\u2019s not a great way of not scaring her off, Parker. Of course, it doesn\u2019t help that we just ran into your deranged sister. She\u2019s being crazier than ever, by the way. She\u2019s here with Jolene.\u201d</p><p>Parker began to scan the crowd at that. \u201cThat little brat. What the hell is she doing, anyways? What does she hope to accomplish? She\u2019s only making it so you\u2019ll never want to speak to her again. I\u2019ll have a word with her. Which way did she go?\u201d</p><p>James pointed in the direction we had come from, and Parker was off in a flash. James grinned at me.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll lecture her all night.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t reply as yet another woman approached us, her smile friendly and warm. She was maybe five seven, with curly white-blond hair clipped up in an elegant style. She was classically beautiful, with even features and soft pink lips. The color of her soft pink gown suited her perfectly. It was one shouldered and mermaid style, with fluffy layers of taffeta making it move playfully as she walked. I didn\u2019t think many women could have pulled the style off. She had a very slim figure, and moved with absolute confidence in her own skin. I thought that Jackie would love to dress that figure.</p><p>She walked directly into James\u2019s arms for a long embrace. I watched the exchange with the cool mask I had adopted for the evening, taking a careful step away from them. I wondered what the odds were that James somehow hadn\u2019t slept with this lovely woman. I was guessing not good. I was happy to be wrong.</p><p>She pulled back finally to smile at us both, looking back and forth between us. She smiled, her gaze finally just settling on me. \u201cYou must be Bianca. I\u2019m so happy to meet you. I\u2019m Parker\u2019s wife, Sophia.\u201d</p><p>I smiled back, but I knew it was stiff. I had become too guarded to even try to adopt a real smile.</p><p>\u201cPleased to meet you, Sophia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJules is at it again. Parker has gone off to try to talk some sense into her. She and Jolene came here together.\u201d</p><p>Sophia grimaced. \u201cThat little fool.\u201d She looked at me, reaching out to touch my arm reassuringly.</p><p>\u201cJules puts on a good show, but she is basically a society princess who\u2019s spoiled to the point that she\u2019s never had to deal with the notion that she can\u2019t have everything she wants. She\u2019s being particularly dense about the fact that she can\u2019t have James. It drives Parker and I crazy that, to this day, their daddy gives her everything she wants. She\u2019s never had to work a day in her life, and she has way too much time on her hands to cause trouble.\u201d</p><p>Sophia looked at James. \u201cParker is seriously considering telling their daddy about some of the things she\u2019s done. She\u2019s got her parents half sold on some of her delusions about you two. As though she\u2019s been holding a torch all these years, as opposed to the truth, which is that she\u2019s always done whatever the hell she wants, with whoever she wants, male or female. Hell, she made a pass at me when Parker and I became engaged. The fact is, she\u2019s thinks she\u2019s in love with you, but that\u2019s only because she\u2019s too selfish to know what love actually is. And you\u2019ve always been clear about how you felt.\u201d She took a breath after that little speech. I just blinked at her. Not many people were so open at a first meeting.</p><p>\u201cAnyways,\u201d she continued, \u201cdon\u2019t be surprised if you see Jules and Parker\u2019s parents and it\u2019s a touch awkward. They have no notion of what\u2019s actually going on.\u201d</p><p>James sighed heavily. \u201cI can\u2019t say I\u2019m looking forward to it. Perhaps I should have a word with them myself. The things she\u2019s been telling the gossip mags is unacceptable.\u201d</p><p>Sophia blanched. \u201cYes, you\u2019re absolutely right, but I think Parker should be the one to speak to them about all of it. I\u2019ll make sure he does that sooner rather than later.\u201d</p><p>James nodded, but he did not look happy about it.</p><p>Sophia seemed to spot someone in the crush behind us. She kissed me on the cheek. \u201cPlease, you have to come have dinner at our house sometime. I promise the talk will be about more pleasant things.\u201d I nodded rather stiffly before she strode away.</p><p>James watched her go, waving at whoever she was joining. I guessed it was Parker, though I didn\u2019t turn to look. He studied me for a long time, looking solemn and a touch worried. \u201cAre you okay, Love?\u201d</p><p>I just studied him, my chest feeling tight and achy. \u201cJolene was your submissive,\u201d I said, my voice very soft.</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO</p><p>His mouth tightened and his jaw clenched, but he didn\u2019t look even a little surprised that I had guessed.</p><p>\u201cYes, she was. Past-tense. Please, let\u2019s not talk about it here. I\u2019ll tell you anything you want to know, but later.\u201d</p><p>I thought of him doing all of the things that he did to me to that perfect creature, and I felt sick. How could I compete with someone so beautiful? And how could he want me for long, when he had a woman like that, still so obviously infatuated with him? The thought was daunting and demoralizing.</p><p>He gripped my nape firmly. My gaze had gone a little glassy with my thoughts, but I looked back at him squarely. His face was composed, but there was trouble in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t think like that,\u201d he said, his voice quiet but pained. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I arched a brow at him. \u201cYou\u2019re reading my mind now?\u201d I asked him. I was only half-joking. The man had an uncanny ability to read me.</p><p>He sighed. \u201cIn a way. I could tell by looking at you that you were having doubts about us. About me. I can\u2019t change my past, Bianca. All I can do is be honest with you, and I\u2019ve done my best.\u201d</p><p>I tried to make him understand. \u201cI understand that. But understanding and feeling okay with it aren\u2019t always the same. Your past, all of the other women...intimidate me. There\u2019s no way I can compete with all of that.\u201d</p><p>His eyes got a little wild at my words. His voice held a hint of cold anger when he spoke. \u201cI\u2019ve never asked you to. You have no competition for me, Bianca.\u201d Someone should tell his ex-lovers that, I thought, but even as I had the thought, I knew it was petty.</p> <p>He studied me, visibly calming himself in that mercurial way of his. \u201cLet\u2019s go dance,\u201d he murmured, leading me in the direction of the ballroom.</p><p>\u201cI really don\u2019t know how,\u201d I said to him, voice pitched low so I wouldn\u2019t be overheard.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. I want to show you something. Come.\u201d</p><p>He led me purposefully into the ballroom, and onto the dance floor without further ado. He pulled me into a dance as though it were the most natural thing in the world. And it turned out to be just that. He led, and I followed. He held me close in his arms, barely a breath between us, and moved us as though we\u2019d practiced a thousand times.</p><p>He murmured into my ear as he led us through the steps that turned out to be easy and natural. \u201cYou may not like my experience. But it has it\u2019s uses. It made me see very early on that you and I are different.</p> <p>This thing we have is different. Take this dance, for example. It comes so natural, the leading and the following, because you and I are so perfectly matched. And I knew it would. I had no doubts, and I was correct. That\u2019s how it\u2019s always been with you, Bianca. You are not experienced. And perhaps that\u2019s why you can\u2019t see how perfect we are together. Not how I see it, anyways. That\u2019s why you need to learn to trust me. I\u2019m sure of this, sure of us. I will endeavor to convince you as well, my love.\u201d</p><p>I let him lead me through the dance, and it felt like a dream. He took control and it was magic. A heavy violin added a thread of melancholy to the dance, but it added emotion as well. I looked at him as we moved, but I could have closed my eyes, it came so naturally. There were times when I could let him take control, and it was perfect. I had thought that effect could only work in the bedroom, but apparently he dominated the dance floor as well.</p><p>\u201cOh, James,\u201d I sighed, not knowing what to do with him. He was a force of nature. \u201cThis is all so fast.</p><p>You overwhelm every part of me.\u201d</p><p>I hadn\u2019t meant to ruin the moment, but I felt him stiffen instantly at my words.</p><p>\u201cThat sounds ominous,\u201d he said, his voice very low and carrying an almost imperceptible hitch. I wondered sadly if I had put the vulnerability in his eyes. If I was the reason for his oh-so-careful demeanor. But then I mentally chastised myself. I was giving myself too much credit. Perversely, the thought made me feel both sad and reassured.</p> <p>He led me from the floor as the music died briefly. He ignored the music as it started up again, a slow, sensuous chord strong in the instrumental song. I just knew that I had darkened his mood.</p><p>\u201cI need to use the restroom, James,\u201d I told him quietly. Mostly I needed a moment to myself. I had only spoken the truth. I was utterly overwhelmed by him. Still, it hurt me to displease him, as I knew my constant reluctance did, and I needed a moment alone to compose myself. A wave of sadness rocked me.</p><p>I was supposed to be the innocent one here, but I simply couldn\u2019t trust James in the way he seemed to trust me. The very idea was impossible to me. I didn\u2019t even trust my own feelings. Every emotion he made me feel was met with my reluctance, and my skepticism, and my doubt. I felt like half of a person, the part that could trust other people somehow missing from my soul.</p><p>\u201cOf course. This way,\u201d he said, his voice just as quiet as mine had been, leading my by a hand gripped just above my elbow.</p><p>I felt an urge to reassure him, or even to apologize, for what, I wasn\u2019t quite sure. In the end, I was silent.</p><p>He led me to the restrooms, pointing down the hallway as we parted. \u201cI\u2019ll be waiting in the antechamber to the dining hall.\u201d He walked away.</p><p>Even the restroom was daunting, huge with cream and white marble along the floor, and thick columns that seemed out of place in a bathroom.</p><p>The stalls were made of glass that frosted over from transparent to opaque as you clicked the lock into place. I\u2019d seen the trick before in a few hotspot Vegas clubs, but I was still vaguely impressed with the effect.</p> <p>I just stood there for the longest time, door closed, taking deep, painful breaths. I tried to place what was affecting me so. I felt myself falling, once again, so deeply under James\u2019s intoxicating spell, but some part of me just couldn\u2019t trust him.</p><p>But was it him? Or was it me? Was I so superficial that, just because he was so impossibly beautiful, I didn\u2019t believe he could ever really fall for me the way I\u2019d so easily fallen for him?</p><p>He had an angel\u2019s face, but his eyes were so hypnotically tarnished, a mirror of my own pain in their depths. I had never been superficial, and I knew that his looks hadn\u2019t been what made me fall for him. It was the soul underneath all of that beautiful packaging. I had seen that he was more, so why wouldn\u2019t I let myself trust that? Why had that seductively beautiful submissive, so much closer to his physical equal than myself, shaken my faith in him with just a brief encounter? Was I insecure, or just realistic? I berated myself, again and again, for being foolish. If he had wanted to be with Jolene, he wouldn\u2019t be with me... Finally, when I felt I had given myself a good enough pep talk, I let myself out of the stall. I nodded politely to the bathroom attendant as I washed my hands.</p><p>I was checking my makeup carefully in the mirror when two figures breezed through the door. I stiffened when I saw who they were.</p><p>Jules practically beamed when she spotted me. Jolene\u2019s look was even more confusing. It was feral and almost...smoldering.</p><p>They moved to flank me, moving together as though they had planned it. I towered over both of them, but they still managed to make me feel overwhelmed.</p><p>\u201cBianca,\u201d Jules murmured, running a hand over my hair affectionately.</p><p>I stiffened until I felt a little brittle. Her smile grew wider, and perversely, warmer. \u201cHow are you, love? Is James sweeping you off of your feet? He\u2019s very good at that, you know. No one so beautiful was ever so charming as our James. Wouldn\u2019t you agree, Jolene?\u201d</p><p>Jolene was studying me in the mirror, barely blinking as her stunning eyes drank me in. \u201cHe\u2019s irresistible and completely relentless when he wants a new woman. In the beginning, he pursued me with such passion and fire that I still dream about it sometimes. I\u2019ve never felt as beautiful or desirable as I did when I was with our James. It was the most exhilarating year of my life.\u201d</p><p>My breath caught, my heart pounding in my chest nearly loud enough to drown out the last of her words.</p><p>A year? My head began to spin.</p><p>\u201cTell her everything, Jolene,\u201d Jules prompted the other woman. It was an order, really.</p><p>\u201cI was under contract with Mr. Cavendish for a year and two months. I belonged to him for that time, exclusively unless he said otherwise, to do with as he wished, completely at his disposal. I was in my own personal heaven.\u201d</p><p>Under contract? I tried to take it all in. I had known a little about the contract she spoke of, though he had never tried to do the same to me. Perhaps because he had been afraid to scare me off, perhaps not.</p><p>But a year and two months? He had claimed never to have had a girlfriend before, but this sounded far more serious than having a girlfriend... \u201cHow long ago was this?\u201d I asked Jolene, keeping my face very carefully blank, my tone very empty.</p><p>She ran her tongue over her teeth, and the gesture struck me hard, as though she had learned it from being so familiar with James. She must know him so much better than I do, I thought. \u201cThree years ago.\u201d</p><p>I was somewhat mollified. I arched a brow at our reflections. \u201cA bit long ago for you to still be so hung up on him, don\u2019t you think?\u201d I asked her. I didn\u2019t mind at all if I came off as a bitch with these two women. The last time I had encountered Jules, her words had crushed me, and I had fled like a wounded animal. I wanted her to know, this time, that I was not such an easy mark.</p><p>Jolene\u2019s eyes were earnest, as though she felt not even a hint of my malice. \u201cThree years ago was the end of our written contract, but far from the end of us. He still calls me often, between whatever fresh conquests he\u2019s obsessed with. Just six weeks ago he flew me out to Vegas on his private jet to spend a night with him.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE</p><p>That one hit it\u2019s mark squarely, and I felt myself trembling. I did some absent math in my disconnected brain. He had admitted to being with a woman only one day before he had met me. The dates added up for her claim. At least he hadn\u2019t called her while we were on a break... I turned my eyes to Jules, studying her and trying very hard to remind myself that this woman was just trying to cause trouble. And still, it was working... \u201cAnd what is your purpose in all of this, Jules? Are you going to map out your own relationship with James for me?\u201d</p><p>She gave me that warm smile. The most sincere fake smile I\u2019d ever seen. \u201cI\u2019m not his submissive, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re asking. He\u2019s always seen me too much as his equal to ever treat me that way.\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t get it , I thought, a little shocked. It wasn\u2019t about equality. If anything, James had always made me feel that I had most of the power in the relationship, outside of the bedroom. After all of the trouble this woman had caused us, to realize that she wasn\u2019t even his type, and that she didn\u2019t understand him at all, was stunning.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m his social equal,\u201d she continued, \u201cand we have always been perfectly matched. I\u2019m self-confident enough to allow him his kinky little side affairs.\u201d</p><p>All I could think as she spoke was how pathetic she was. \u201cYou realize that he has a completely different opinion about your relationship, don\u2019t you? He said it\u2019s been at least a year since you\u2019ve had sex. He claims that you\u2019re just a friend.\u201d</p><p>Her face tightened nearly imperceptibly, but I saw the tension around her mouth. It was written on her young face like an old bitterness. \u201cHe\u2019s sowing his wild oats. I\u2019m an understanding woman. He needs that in a partner. It\u2019s something only someone from our social class could really comprehend.\u201d</p><p>I had nearly forgotten about Jolene until she pressed her large, soft breasts against my arm. My gaze swung to hers in the mirror. Hers were smoldering at me.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t need to be your enemies, Bianca,\u201d she said, her voice nearly breathless. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to last for any length of time at all with our James, you should know that he only stays interested in women who like other women.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I blinked at her, trying hard to find another meaning to her words. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d I asked her.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t mistake how she rubbed against me. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing he loves more than dominating two women at once. Hasn\u2019t he mentioned that to you yet? I loved it when he brought other women into the playground with us. And, of course, as his favorite, he brings me back in to play with his new subs.\u201d</p><p>A wave of nausea hit me, and my fists clenched. I did not want these women to know how they\u2019d affected me, but it was already a struggle, and I knew they weren\u2019t finished.</p><p>Jolene lowered the sleeveless top of her dress, exposing the perfectly proportioned, overly generous globes of her breasts. I noticed the large silver hoops pierced into her dark red nipples immediately.</p> <p>Her sinfully full lips curved into a sensuous smile. \u201cHe only gives these to his favorites. Didn\u2019t you know?</p><p>Jules shocked me by pressing hard against me from behind and grabbing my wrists in a hard grip. It didn\u2019t even occur to me to struggle at first. A physical threat from these women was the last thing I had expected.</p><p>Even as Jules moved, Jolene was reaching her arms up around my neck and pressing her soft figure against me. Her petite, small-framed body was much stronger than I could have imagined as she pulled my head down to hers.</p><p>\u201cJust a taste, Bianca,\u201d she whispered, just before she crushed her soft mouth to mine. I registered that it felt beyond strange to be kissed by such a soft, moist mouth as she moved her lips against mine. I was frozen in shock at the unexpected assault until she thrust her little tongue into my mouth. I began to struggle against the two women holding me in earnest, then. I bit Jolene\u2019s tongue hard enough to make her pull back with a curse.</p><p>She looked absolutely shocked at my rejection as she stepped away from me, her hand to her mouth.</p> <p>Jules released me at almost the same moment, moving in front of me to join a red-faced Jolene. Jolene\u2019s eyes made a surprisingly quick transformation from shocked to hard and mean as I watched the sensually lovely woman.</p><p>She pointed a finger at me. \u201cYou\u2019re making a mistake, you know. You can\u2019t hope to hold his interest unless you\u2019re willing to be more open-minded. He\u2019s completely insatiable. He needs variety, and if you can\u2019t provide it, he\u2019ll be done with you in a week.\u201d As she spoke, Jules was adjusting Jolene\u2019s top back over her breasts. Her touch on the other woman spoke of familiarity.</p><p>I glared at both of them. \u201cThat\u2019s not happening. If James wants other women, he\u2019s free to have them.</p><p>I\u2019ll leave him so fast his head will spin. And if you two like women so much, you can have each other.</p><p>Why even bother with James?\u201d</p><p>Jolene\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change at all. \u201cYou won\u2019t be able to let him go so easily. And he\u2019s impossible to forget. Mark my words, you\u2019ll change your mind about wanting me. I\u2019ll be waiting.\u201d As she spoke, the two women linked their fingers together, a clear sign of their solidarity.</p> <p>Jules gave me a very \u2018cat that ate the canary\u2019 smile as they sauntered out of the bathroom. They walked out slowly, as though they hadn\u2019t assaulted me just moments before.</p><p>I just stood there, staring at the closed door for long moments, completely stunned by the whole deranged exchange. In spite of my resolve not to let Jules cause us problems, the things I had been told had shaken my faith in James, and in our ability to have any kind of a stable relationship. I turned from the closed door to look in the mirror. The sight that met my eyes made me angry. My mouth was smeared with Jolene\u2019s crimson lipstick, and my eyes were wide and scared. I dragged the back of my hand across my mouth, wiping away the offending color.</p><p>I had forgotten about the bathroom attendant completely. I only recalled her presence as she kindly offered me a towel. I thanked her gratefully, wiping at the red on my lips, trying to erase every trace. It clung to my mouth stubbornly. I hated the color.</p><p>The bathroom door burst open and a furious James tore inside as though he\u2019d hit it at a dead sprint. He took me in with wild eyes, searching the bathroom as he moved towards me.</p><p>A drop-dead gorgeous woman hurried in the door behind him. She had streaky blond hair worn down her back in whimsical mermaid waves. She wore a soft gray sheath gown that managed to be both elegant and sexy. It covered her from neck to ankle but did nothing to disguise her spectacular, supermodel figure.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t spare her much of a glance as James reached me swiftly, cupping a hand at the back of my head, his other hand tilting my chin up to study me.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d he asked.</p><p>My hand grabbed his where it held my chin, and his eyes flew to the back of my hand. It was covered in crimson lipstick smears.</p> <p>His eyes moved from my hand to my mouth and back again. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d he repeated, his tone harsh.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you guess? Your Exes got their hands on me. The short one doesn\u2019t understand the word no very well,\u201d I told him. My voice came out more coldly than I meant for it to.</p><p>His hand tightened to a nearly painful grip on my chin. His voice got very quiet, but I heard the panic in it. \u201cThey assaulted you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJules held my wrists while Jolene took her top off and forced me to kiss her. Yeah, I guess you could say they assaulted me. They seem to have some sort of routine down for pressuring your women into trying threesomes.\u201d I made my face and voice as expressionless as I could manage. I wanted to see his response and I watched him carefully for it.</p><p>He cringed, an awful kind of rawness overtaking his face. He pulled me into his chest. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I should have done a better job of protecting you. I swear I\u2019ll take the necessary steps to make sure nothing like that ever happens again. I just never dreamed they would do something like confront you in a bathroom. And I never imagined they would put their hands on you.\u201d</p><p>I should have realized that he\u2019d blame himself for it all. I still felt angry and bitter about the entire thing, but even in spite of that, I felt myself wanting to soften towards him.</p><p>\u201cBianca, this is Lana. She\u2019s an old friend of mine.\u201d James made the introduction while still holding my face buried in his chest. \u201cShe happened in on you being harassed in the bathroom and was kind enough to come get me.\u201d</p><p>I turned to meet the woman, not missing the clear affection I heard in his voice as he said the woman\u2019s name.</p><p>The woman was even more stunning than I had realized, as I caught my second glance at her, this time closer up. She gave me a friendly, if very careful, smile. She had the face of a fairytale princess, with eyes so bright a blue they were violet. I wondered if they could have been her real eye color. I had never met anyone with purple eyes before.</p><p>Her wavy blond hair had every shade of blonde streaked through it as it flowed down her back and around her shoulders like a whimsical cape. Her face was stunning, her features perfectly symmetrical, her eyes big and thickly lashed, her nose tiny and pert, her soft, pouty mouth damn near as pretty as James\u2019s.</p><p>She stood at eye level with me, which meant she was somewhere between five nine and six feet tall, though I couldn\u2019t say for sure without a good look at the size of her heels. As I studied her, I realized that somehow I recognized this exquisite woman, though I hadn\u2019t a clue how. She was not the type of woman anyone could forget meeting.</p><p>She saw my brow furrow as I studied her. She seemed to read my thoughts, and grimaced. \u201cYou recognize me,\u201d she said with a sigh. Her voice was soft and musical. She shot James an arch look.</p><p>\u201cJames, you\u2019re in the ladies restroom, as you seem to have forgotten. Go wait outside. I\u2019ll help your Bianca freshen up so you two can make your escape. I\u2019ll even make your excuses for you, but you need to get out of this bathroom before you create a scene. Anyone could come in here at any moment.\u201d</p><p>James kissed the top of my head before heading to the door. He cast me a worried glance but spoke to Lana. \u201cDon\u2019t be long,\u201d he warned.</p><p>She held out a chair in front of a vanity for me. \u201cSit down, hon,\u201d she said. I complied, responding automatically to the kindness in her voice. She couldn\u2019t have been more than twenty-six, but she had an almost maternal countenance, in spite of her bombshell looks.</p><p>I studied her in the mirror, but still couldn\u2019t place her. \u201cWhat do I know you from?\u201d I asked her finally.</p><p>She had a huge, if fashionable, handbag, splayed out on the counter, and was digging through it determinedly.</p><p>She cast me a wry smile. \u201cI had a dismally short stint in modeling a few years ago. I wasn\u2019t suited for it at all, but people occasionally recognize me from some high profile covers I did. I only ever even got the covers because my mother was a supermodel from the eighties.\u201d</p><p>As she spoke I conjured up a memory of her in a tiny yellow bikini, straddling a surfboard for a very famous cover of Sports Illustrated. My jaw dropped. \u201cYou were a supermodel yourself. You don\u2019t model anymore?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged, her smile turning very self-deprecating. \u201cIt\u2019s a fact that I\u2019m much better at working for the family business than I ever was at smiling for the camera.\u201d</p><p>I studied the fascinating woman, happy for a distraction from the night\u2019s drama. \u201cWhat\u2019s the family business?\u201d</p><p>She flashed a charming dimple at me. \u201cDon\u2019t hold it against me, but my family is also in the hotel business. The Middletons are infamous competitors of the Cavendish family. Imagine everyone\u2019s shock when James and I met and became fast friends, over eight years ago.\u201d</p><p>I wondered if friends could possibly be all that they were. How could two such outrageously good looking people of the opposite sex be strictly friends? Especially if one of them was James... She seemed to read my mind again. Her eyes widened on mine in the mirror and she vehemently shook her head. \u201cWe have been strictly friends. We went out to dinner a few times when we first met. I think James was toying with the idea of trying to seduce me, but it never came to that. He\u2019s a man that knows how to read women, and he knew I was unreceptive. And I must tell you, I\u2019m quite relieved at the change I\u2019ve seen in him since he\u2019s met you. I had thought, for the longest time, that James was as broken as me, if for different reasons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBroken?\u201d I asked, completely drawn in by her candid manner.</p><p>She grimaced, but her fairytale lavender eyes quickly smoothed back into a smile. \u201cI\u2019m not usually such an open book, but I can\u2019t seem to help it with you. It makes sense, I suppose. You and I just have to be friends. I adore James, and I adore you on principal just for being the woman to finally make him fall in love.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTY-FOUR</p><p>I didn\u2019t correct her words, though they made me wince as though she\u2019d hit upon a very tender subject.</p><p>Instead, I turned the focus back on her. \u201cWhy did you say you were broken?\u201d</p><p>She smiled. It was the saddest smile, unarguably heartbreaking. She just had that effect. What she felt showed on her lovely face, and it was impossible not to feel at least a little of it with her.</p><p>\u201cSince I can remember, I\u2019ve been in love with a man who can never love me back. In fact, he\u2019s in love with someone else, though it took me a long time to see that. My heart\u2019s never been able to move on, so, much to my parents horror, I seem to be immune to the opposite sex. Even to a man as beautiful as James. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I tried to be attracted to him, at first, but it\u2019s no use. I think that it was after that when I knew not to bother anymore. I\u2019m the type of woman who will only ever fall in love once. Unfortunately, that one time happened to be with a man who could only ever see me as a sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s impossible,\u201d I told her. \u201cYou could have any man you wanted.\u201d</p><p>She just shook her head, finally pulling a brush out of her monstrosity of a designer bag. She began to carefully pull the brush through my mussed-up hair. \u201cLovely hair,\u201d she murmured to me almost absently.</p><p>\u201cYou and I could pass for sisters, really,\u201d she added. I thought it was a hugely flattering compliment.</p> <p>\u201cHow many women have naturally blond hair nowadays? You\u2019re the only other one I know. But, no, I certainly cannot have any man I want. And I only ever wanted one. Akira Kalua. I shamelessly threw myself at him and the best I got was a pity fuck, pardon my crass language, but that\u2019s the best term for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAkira Kalua,\u201d I repeated back, surprised at the name. It sounded vaguely familiar, though I couldn\u2019t place why. I thought the name sounded very Hawaiian. I had several Hawaiian friends, and there was a large population of them working for my airline.</p><p>She smiled almost wistfully, as though just hearing the name brought back bittersweet memories. \u201cI\u2019m an island girl at heart, if you can believe it, though I was banished from paradise a long time ago. God, I hate New York.\u201d</p><p>I was more than a little surprised at that admission. I had just assumed, with her family wealth and incredible looks, that she would fit right into the big apple. \u201cYou\u2019re from Hawaii?\u201d I guessed.</p><p>She nodded, smoothing my hair with a comforting hand before digging back into her bag. \u201cBorn and raised. My dad fell in love with Hawaii when my mother was pregnant with me. Maui, to be specific.</p> <p>By the time they were ready to live in a different house, I wasn\u2019t ready to go with them. They had to leave without me, and my adopted Hawaiian family wound up having me more than my actual parents did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about Akira,\u201d I prompted. She just smiled, shaking her head. She brought a makeup wipe to my face, wiping off the errant mascara that had bled under my eyes. I wanted badly to hear her story now that she had given me a few juicy tidbits. From the beauty of her face and the sadness in her eyes, I just knew it was a tragic love story that would be captivating.</p><p>\u201cAnother time, perhaps. You need to join James before he causes a scene. We have to hang out sometime soon, though. James told me you live in Vegas. I spend a lot of time there, managing the family property. It\u2019s only five minutes from the Cavendish property, in fact. I\u2019ll get your number from James.</p><p>Have lunch with me?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. I had met her minutes ago, but I felt like we were already friends. It was more than a little unusual for me. \u201cWill you tell me about Akira then?\u201d I asked, strangely curious about this lovely woman\u2019s love life.</p><p>She gave me an exasperated look, digging into her handbag again. She handed me a tube of clear lipgloss. \u201cJust use your finger. I swear it\u2019s never touched my lips. It\u2019ll make your lips look less bruised. And yes, I\u2019ll tell you about Akira when we meet for lunch, if you really want to know. I never talk about him, so maybe it\u2019ll be therapeutic to get it off of my chest. But you have to tell me about you and James.\u201d</p> <p>I liked Lana, so I agreed as I dabbed on a bit of lipgloss with my finger, handing the tube back to her.</p><p>She smiled at me. \u201cGood as new. James will want to get out of here asap. He\u2019s in a rare state. He was expected to say a few words, but I\u2019m familiar with the charity, so let him know I\u2019ll step in for him. I\u2019ll call you sometime this week.\u201d</p><p>When I stood she enveloped me in a tight hug. I hugged her back, more than a little surprised by the affectionate gesture.</p><p>\u201cGod, I love that you\u2019re as tall as me. I don\u2019t feel like a giant around you. We have got to hang out,\u201d she said with a smile as she pulled back.</p><p>James was practically pacing impatiently as we stepped out of the bathroom. He grabbed my arm in a death-grip as soon as I was within reach.</p><p>\u201cGo on. I\u2019ll make your excuses. Oh, and James, send me Bianca\u2019s number. We\u2019re going out to lunch, hopefully sometime this week,\u201d Lana told him.</p><p>He gave her a grateful, if tense, smile. \u201cThanks, Lana. I owe you.\u201d He began to lead me away, not pausing as he spoke. \u201cThe car is being brought \u2018round. We can make a quick escape. I need to get out of here.\u201d</p><p>Becoming almost twitchy with impatience, James led us out of the ball and into a waiting town car in a dizzying blur of activity. We exited into a tiny back alley where I saw no sign of photographers.</p> <p>I sensed James withdrawing as the car began to move. When I gazed out the window I felt him studying me but when I turned back to look at him, he was gazing out of his own window, stone-faced.</p><p>I had endless questions that I needed answers to. I wanted to know what Jolene had lied about and what had been the truth. I hoped to god not all of it had been true. I wanted and needed, to know, but I was almost scared to hear his side of it, scared that our relationship wouldn\u2019t survive the answers. And it didn\u2019t help that I had no idea where to even begin.</p><p>We were nearly back to his building before I broke the silence. The feet that stretched between us on the seat felt like miles.</p><p>\u201cYou said you\u2019d never been in a serious relationship before, but Jolene claims that you were with her for a year and two months, and that you continued to see her often, up until six weeks ago. Was she lying?\u201d</p><p>He was silent for an unnervingly long time, his face unmoving as he stared out the window. \u201cWe\u2019re almost to my building. We\u2019ll talk about this inside.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t like that answer. I knew that the only answer I would have liked would have been a quick and unhesitant, \u2018yes, she was lying.\u2019</p><p>The driver took us to the underground garage elevator and we disembarked from the car silently. James took my arm in a proprietary manner as we walked to the elevator, but didn\u2019t even touch me once we were alone. It made a little ball of terrible black dread tie a knot in my belly.</p><p>He was deeply upset, and it had to do with what had happened in the bathroom. Was he upset about the questions I would ask? Was he troubled about how I would respond to his answers? Or was it something worse? I was starting to worry that it was something even more terrible, like he was about to break up with me altogether. Had the whole relationship idea finally sank in for him, and now he was realizing that it wasn\u2019t what he wanted? Had seeing the lovely Jolene made him realize his mistake? A part of me had been expecting him to do something like that all the while.</p><p>\u201cCan we talk in our bedroom?\u201d James asked, finally breaking the silence as we neared the top floor of the building.</p><p>I studied him. He wouldn\u2019t even look at me. I thought I might become physically ill. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to move this quickly, James. We shouldn\u2019t even be talking about moving in together yet, let alone actually doing it.\u201d I\u2019ve lost all of my pride, I realized. I was trying to reassure him that we could take a step back instead ending it altogether. Anything to keep him from saying what I feared he was thinking.</p><p>He sent me an almost stricken look, but quickly looked away, making me think I\u2019d imagined it. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk in our room,\u201d he said. I wasn\u2019t reassured.</p><p>The elevator reached his floor, and he led me up to his room without a word. I saw from a clock we passed that it was just past eleven o\u2019clock. I was shocked that it wasn\u2019t any later than that. A lot had happened in the last few hours. I thought of Lana Middleton. She had been a welcome distraction. \u201cDo you know anything about Lana and Akira?\u201d I asked James.</p><p>He still didn\u2019t look at me. \u201cAkira?\u201d he asked. So he didn\u2019t know, either.</p><p>\u201cNever mind.\u201d</p><p>He was walking first up the stairs to the floor of his bedroom. \u201cLana is the worst workaholic I know.</p><p>She makes me look like a slacker with my seven day work weeks. Everyone who knows her loves her, but even the socializing she does is for work.\u201d His tone was impersonal as he mapped Lana out.</p><p>\u201cShe asked me to go to lunch,\u201d I pointed out.</p><p>\u201cThat means she really likes you. I\u2019m glad. She\u2019s a very good friend, and she\u2019s very discreet and nonjudgemental, so you won\u2019t have to guard your words with her.\u201d</p><p>I blinked, wondering if he meant that I could discuss us with her. \u201cDoes she know about your... preferences?\u201d I asked finally.</p><p>\u201cNot exactly. She knows that I have atypical sexual proclivities, and she knows that I used to sleep around too much, but I doubt she\u2019s heard many more details than that. But I think she would be a good person for you to talk to, if you need that. As I said, she can be trusted with secrets, and she won\u2019t... berate you for your own preferences. That\u2019s just not her way.\u201d</p><p>He had basically given me the go ahead to tell Lana about our BDSM activities. I was grateful that I could, though I still didn\u2019t know if I would. I hadn\u2019t even discussed it with Stephan, and I rarely kept even the most minor of details from him. I decided that it might be easier to tell a woman like Lana than it would be Stephan. He was so protective of me that I wasn\u2019t sure how he would react to the things I let James do to me.</p><p>Our brief distraction technique came to an abrupt end as we reached his bedroom. He hovered in the doorway, ushering me inside. I glanced back at him. He was acting so unlike himself that it raised every hair on my body.</p><p>He just watched me for long minutes, as though trying to get answers just by looking. His face was shuttered, but his hands shook a little as he loosened his silken navy bow-tie.</p><p>\u201cTake off your clothes, Bianca.\u201d When he finally spoke, his voice was dangerously soft.</p><p>I shot him a defiant look, my chin lifting. \u201cWe can\u2019t put this off, James. We need to talk.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cYes. Take off your clothes and get on the bed. We\u2019ll talk then.\u201d</p><p>I watched him closely, trying to decide if it was a strange joke.</p><p>His nostrils flared. \u201cNow,\u201d he said. There was a fine tremor in the hand that pointed to the bed.</p><p>Finally I complied, driven by his strange mood and the desire to know exactly what it meant.</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE</p><p>I stepped out of my shoes as I approached the bed, shrugging out of my floaty gown with a few easy movements. My tiny lace thong was a distant memory between one step and the next.</p><p>I sat on the very edge of the bed, facing him. I was naked, but I didn\u2019t feel as self-conscious as I usually did. I had too many other things to be anxious about.</p><p>\u201cLie down in the center of the bed,\u201d James ordered softly, still framed in the doorway. He was still fully dressed in that devastating navy tux, only his tie mussed, though it still hung undone around his neck.</p><p>I obeyed, but it didn\u2019t come as naturally as it normally did. Sheer force of will made me shift my body onto the spot where he\u2019d ordered it.</p><p>\u201cSpread your legs and raise your hands over your head,\u201d he continued.</p><p>I shot him a wild look. He was getting waaay off track. \u201cJames,\u201d I began. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDo it,\u201d he said with a new trace of steel in his voice. I closed my eyes, nearly shuddering as I obeyed him. I wanted answers, but I couldn\u2019t lie to myself. I wanted this just as much.</p><p>He only moved after I\u2019d complied, striding towards the bed and using the restraints hidden at each corner of the bed to secure me swiftly. As he stared at my restrained body, some of the tension seemed to drain out of him, right before my eyes.</p><p>He loomed over me from the side of the bed for a long time before he finally spoke. \u201cNow you can\u2019t run away if you get upset. Ask me whatever you need to. I\u2019ll answer all of your questions, and you know I\u2019ll be honest, but you don\u2019t get to run away if you don\u2019t like the answers.\u201d</p><p>I was looking directly at him, but I could see my chest rising and falling with rapid breaths out of the corner of my eye. If his tactic had been to distract me from the questions that troubled me, he\u2019d succeeded beautifully. Now that I was naked and bound, nothing seemed as important as what he could do to me, not even those answers.</p><p>I mentally shook myself, making my mind move back to the discussion at hand with great effort.</p><p>\u201cWas Jolene lying, James?\u201d I finally asked, dreading the answer.</p><p>He ran a restless hand through his dark golden hair, mussing up it\u2019s artful evening styling. He began to pace, shrugging out of his tuxedo jacket and tossing it onto a chair. I was ready to scream by the time he answered.</p><p>\u201cShe wasn\u2019t lying. She was my contracted submissive for about that long. But we didn\u2019t see each other \u2018often\u2019 after that. We met up maybe six times a year, if that, and generally when I was between subs. I know this doesn\u2019t make me look any better, but it was only ever physical between Jolene and I. I know she thinks she\u2019s in love with me, so it was badly done of me to keep in touch, but it was a strictly sexual relationship. It\u2019s an awful thing to say, but I don\u2019t even like her.\u201d</p><p>I flinched every time he mentioned things like \u2018physical\u2019 and \u2018sexual\u2019, horribly vivid images of the two beautiful people entwined naked together flashing through my mind. I turned my head away and shut my eyes for a moment, trying to compose myself. I knew it was silly to be so jealous, but knowing and feeling were two very different things. \u201cWas she the woman you were with the night before I met you?\u201d</p><p>He cursed, a long and fluid rant, but I didn\u2019t look at him.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he answered after a long pause. \u201cI always used a condom with Jolene, though, if that\u2019s what\u2019s worrying you.\u201d</p><p>I counted to ten in my head, the word \u2018condom\u2019 striking at some vulnerable part of me. It wasn\u2019t the condom, but rather the act that went with it, and the horrible woman he had done those things with, painting a vivid and painful picture in my mind of the two of them together.</p><p>My next question embarrassed me for some ludicrous reason, and my cheeks blushed pink even as I began to speak. \u201cJolene said a few things about joining you and your other subs...\u201d</p><p>I felt him sit down near my hip. His hot hand gripped my wrist. The hold was light, but I thought I could still feel his intensity through the contact. \u201cShe joined me and two of my subs in the playground, maybe a handful of times. None of this matters, Bianca. I know it troubles you, but it really is insignificant. How I feel about you is what\u2019s important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe said that there\u2019s nothing you love more than dominating two women at once,\u201d I said quietly, wanting to pull my wrist away from the hot contact of his hand.</p><p>I heard him suck in a breath, but kept my eyes stubbornly closed. \u201cThat\u2019s a lie. I\u2019ve done that with a few subs, but only the subs I knew favored that sort of thing, but that\u2019s never been about my preferences. I suspect that Jolene herself may prefer that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJolene said you didn\u2019t stay with women unless they would do that for you.\u201d</p><p>His palm made contact with my thigh. It wasn\u2019t a slap, exactly, but it wasn\u2019t a soft touch either. \u201cThis is ridiculous. I wouldn\u2019t ask that of you. I would be distraught if you even suggested it. You aren\u2019t just my sub, Bianca. This is much more than just a physical relationship. I feel utterly possessive of you. If someone touched you the way I touch you, male or female, I would lose my mind.\u201d</p><p>He took a shaky breath before he continued. \u201cI want to share my life with you, to be monogamous with you, and my past is in the past. I wish there was some way I could prove it to you, once and for all. I do have a sordid past, but I\u2019ve never lied to any of the women I\u2019ve been with, and I\u2019ve never promised to anyone the things I promise to you.\u201d</p><p>My breathing was growing more even, the strange red haze over my vision getting better with every word he spoke. He was charming me out of my doubts, and no part of me wanted him to stop. I have it bad, I realized then. It was worse than I had even realized, and I\u2019d known I was already crazy in love with this incomparable man. \u201cThank you for answering my questions,\u201d I told him softly.</p><p>He was so quiet for a long moment that I couldn\u2019t even hear him breathe. \u201cYou\u2019re not upset?\u201d he asked finally.</p><p>\u201cA little, but I\u2019ll get over it. I get insanely jealous when I think about you with other women, and I was sick with worry that you would want me to do things with Jolene that I just can\u2019t do, but I\u2019m not unreasonable.\u201d I looked at him as I spoke. His face was stricken.</p><p>He crawled on top of me still fully clothed. He moved until we were nose to nose, that awful look still on his face. \u201cI would never ask you to do anything like that. Moreover, I wouldn\u2019t allow it. You promised me exclusivity, and I intend for you to hold up your end of that as staunchly as I\u2019ll hold up mine.</p> <p>Will you still move in with me, still stay with me? Even though I\u2019ve done a dismal job of protecting you?\u201d</p><p>I agreed that I would, even though my doubt was still a thick knot in my stomach, but as I was learning, again and again, he was impossible to resist.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t exactly protect me in the women\u2019s restroom, James. That\u2019s just silly. And you certainly couldn\u2019t predict that they would do that to me. I couldn\u2019t believe it even when it was happening. Jolene showed me her piercings. I really didn\u2019t ever want to see that.\u201d</p><p>James got up at my words, moving swiftly into his bathroom. He returned quick moments later with a toothbrush. He was very gentle as he brushed my teeth. It was an awkward angle with me on my back and helpless. \u201cTell me where they touched you. I want to scrub them off of you.\u201d</p><p>I thought he was beyond strange, and it went without saying that this was some kind of OCD on his part, but I enabled his strange need to wash them away, telling him every single thing they had done, and every part of me that had been touched.</p><p>His face was dark as he worked, scrubbing hard at my wrists. He worked for a long time on my kiss swollen lips. They were swollen more from the way I had scrubbed them myself than from the kisses, but it didn\u2019t seem to matter to James. When he was finally done scrubbing, he moisturized me thoroughly, spreading something that felt like vaseline directly onto my lips.</p><p>\u201cIt would have saved time if you had just let me loose to shower,\u201d I told him, trying to make him smile, anything to ease the tense set of his shoulders, and the dark look in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t bring myself to untie you. I have this nagging fear that you\u2019ll run away from me again, and I\u2019ll have to suffer through another desolate month. That was the longest month of my life. I\u2019d do anything to never let it happen again.\u201d</p><p>I felt a strange wrenching in my chest at the thought of him alone and suffering because of me. I hadn\u2019t withdrawn to hurt him. I had been scared, scared of the way he made me feel, and the way I couldn\u2019t seem to help but do his will.</p><p>\u201cMake love to me, James.\u201d My voice held a clear plea as I addressed him.</p><p>I didn\u2019t have to ask him twice. He was on top of me in a flash, kissing my mouth as though he wanted to devour me. He was still fully clothed, and the silk of his shirt rubbed against my chest teasingly. He propped the lower half of his body just out of reach. I circled my hips, trying to reach him, but my legs held me securely against the soft bed. I arched my back, rubbing my chest harder against his. He thrust his tongue deep into my mouth, and I sucked on it, drawing on it like I would his cock. He groaned.</p><p>He\u2019d propped himself up on his elbows, setting them deep into my underarms so he could cup my face as he kissed me. I thought this was the closest James could get to sweet lovemaking. But even his sweetest moment was still too fucking hot to bear.</p><p>I whimpered against his mouth. It was a plea. My body was throbbing for him, and nothing would feel like enough until he was buried deep inside me. He didn\u2019t seem to agree, and just continued like that for long, torturous minutes, only the top halves of our bodies touching as he worshipped at my mouth.</p><p>Eventually he began to move down my body with sweet, torturous kisses along every inch of me. His pretty mouth was incredibly and deliberately soft as he rained kisses across my ribs and into my navel.</p><p>He\u2019d avoided my quivering breasts altogether, seeming to focus on absolutely every other inch of my torso. I realized that he was torturing me systematically when he moved back up my body and began to kiss along my shoulder tops and up one of my bound arms.</p><p>He moved off of me as he focused on one fettered wrist. I watched him, his face so sensual, no coldness present tonight. He licked along the spot where the black rope met the inside of my wrist, and I writhed.</p><p>He rose to his knees to massage my hand for long, agonizing minutes. It felt exquisite, but I wanted to scream.</p><p>He moved back down my arm, across my shoulders, and gave the opposite arm, wrist, and hand the same treatment. I felt on the edge of orgasm just from that and the sight of him crawling around me on the giant bed, his full erection clearly outlined even in his navy silk trousers.</p><p>I sucked in a breath as he nuzzled into my underarm, licking me there as though it were a rare treat. He licked and kissed just the undersides of my breasts as he moved to my other side to repeat the motion. I squirmed. \u201cHold still,\u201d he murmured, a warning note in his voice.</p><p>He continued to torment me for the longest time, kissing and licking and nuzzling into my skin, while skipping all of the obvious spots. I discovered as he did this that he had enough skill to draw exquisite pleasure from even the most innocent parts of my body. He had me panting just by paying special attention to the dimples in my knees. \u201cJames,\u201d I gasped, \u201cyou should be illegal. There can\u2019t be anyone alive as good at this as you.\u201d</p><p>He gave me a heated look from under his pretty lashes for that one. \u201cIf there is, you\u2019ll never know it,\u201d</p><p>he said, rather darkly, I thought.</p><p>That exchange seemed to light a fire in him and he began to pleasure me in earnest. He licked his way up to my breasts, drawing on a nipple until I was ready to come just from that nearly painful pressure. He gave equal attention to it\u2019s twin before moving down the center of my torso, past my naval, and into my core. I screamed as he finally buried his face there. This was no idle caress, and he used his fingers and tongue to make me come within seconds. He never slowed as I spun back down from my nirvana, bringing me back to orgasm like my nerves were simple keys on a piano. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He was in a relentless sort of mood, and he brought me again and again, until I lost count, though with the mood he was in, I doubted that he forgot the number.</p><p>I felt boneless and light-headed when he finally impaled me. He rammed into me with one clean thrust, and my eyes shot open. They had only been closed because he was too absorbed with his face between my legs to notice the slight.</p><p>Our eyes locked, and I realized in a corner of my very distracted mind that he was still fully clothed.</p><p>Even his tie still remained hanging around his neck, thought he had loosened it. I glanced down at our joined bodies and saw that he had only undone his slacks and pulled them down slightly, just enough to give him access. Something about all of those dark, formal clothes against my naked, bound body was one of the most erotic things I\u2019d ever seen.</p> <p>His forehead nearly touched mine as he held himself over me, working in and out of me with smooth motions. It was downright gentle, for him. He was making slow, sweet love to me, in his way.</p><p>Scant drops of sweat dripped from his temples to mine. I thought it was unbelievably sensual. Only Mr.</p><p>Beautiful could make sweat into something so sexy. I wanted to lick it all off of his body. I told him so.</p><p>He grinned, though there was an edge to it as he continued to thrust in and out of me with agonizing slowness. \u201cNot tonight. You were thinking about taking other lovers while I made love to you. Now I have something to prove. Perhaps if I fuck you unconscious, you won\u2019t be able to wonder if there\u2019s someone better out there for you.\u201d</p><p>I gave him an exasperated look. As much as I could, considering he was slowly fucking me out of my mind. \u201cYou\u2019re impossible, James. You took that all wrong. I was only thinking about you, and how lucky I am to have you.\u201d</p> <p>His face went a little slack. It made my heartstrings pull. With a shout he began to thrust in earnest, and from the look on his face, he was completely losing himself. I loved it. I drank in the sight of his composure completely deserting him as he pounded into me, his beautiful eyes made into slits with the strain. He shouted my name, rather desperately, as his orgasm took him. My own caught me moments later as he continued to arch deeply inside of me.</p><p>He let his heavy weight sag onto me for several minutes in our aftermath. I nuzzled my face into the hair around his ear, smelling his wonderful spicy scent, mixed with his sweat and just a hint of cologne.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wonderful,\u201d I whispered against his hair.</p><p>He stiffened, burying his face into my neck, nuzzling there. \u201cI want to deserve you, my love,\u201d he whispered back. I could hear the desperation in his quiet voice.</p><p>\u201cDo you even know how crazy that is?\u201d I asked in the same quiet voice, as though we could be overheard. \u201cI\u2019m nobody, and you\u2019re the most extraordinary man I\u2019ve ever met. I don\u2019t deserve you.\u201d</p><p>He made a little sound of protest in his throat. \u201cYou\u2019re my angel, Bianca. You\u2019ve exorcized my demons. I don\u2019t have nightmares when I\u2019m with you. I don\u2019t have to work seventy hour work weeks to keep my mind distracted. My life has become more than work and emotionless affairs. You make me a better man.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re so good to me,\u201d I told him.</p><p>He reached up to untie my wrists, kissing me softly all over my face as he did so.</p><p>He had me untied and cradled into his chest in swift moments. I cuddled into the soft silken fabric of his shirt, too tired to even try to get him naked.</p><p>I was just on the edge of sleep when I felt him shift. \u201cLove, I promised Stephan you would call and text him before you went to bed. He wanted to make sure your night went alright. Don\u2019t drift off. I\u2019m going to find your phone.\u201d</p><p>I quickly found I had to sit up to stay awake as James disappeared into his closet. He re-emerged in short order, stripped down to his boxer-briefs, and carrying my phone. He maneuvered himself behind me on the bed, pulling me between his legs as I checked my phone. I had several texts from Stephan, asking how I was, and I texted him back that everything was fine and I would see him in the morning.</p><p>I checked my phone log next. I had missed three more calls from the strange 702 number, and my brows drew together as I saw that the caller had left a voicemail this time. That was new. I found myself clicking the play button and holding my phone to my ear before I thought better of it. I should have waited until morning, but something about the strange caller and number was nagging at me. If it was my father, I\u2019d just as soon know right away, instead of worrying about it all night.</p><p>The voicemail was just silence at first, with the slightest hint of background noise, soft soothing music playing, just like in the phone calls. But eventually a harried female voice began to speak haltingly.</p><p>There was a familiar paranoid fear in her voice, though I didn\u2019t recognize the voice itself at all.</p> <p>\u201cBianca Karlsson. This is, um, this is Sharon.\u201d A long pause. \u201cSharon Karlsson.\u201d My entire body went still as a corpse and the hair on the back of my neck prickled with a warning. \u201cI\u2019m...married to your father. I, well, I guess that I\u2019m your stepmother. I really need to speak to you. Your father always forbade me from trying to contact you. He would never say why, but, well, um, he\u2019s disappeared. He\u2019s been gone for over a month with no word, and I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019s gone for good this time. So I would really appreciate it if you would meet with me. Please call me back as soon as you can.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTY-SIX</p><p>My hand dropped into my lap still holding the phone.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d James asked, apparently not overhearing the strange message. I didn\u2019t answer, my mind busy worrying over the bizarre development of my father having a wife.</p><p>James took the phone out of my hand, and I watched him retrace my steps and hold the phone up to his own ear to listen to my message.</p><p>Nosy, rich bastard, I thought, almost fondly.</p><p>His brow furrowed as he listened to the strange message. He reached over to put my phone on the bedside table, then came close to cuddle me against him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like this. If you decide to meet with her, it should be in public, and make sure you have at least two bodyguards with you. Promise me, Love.\u201d</p><p>I nodded absently, nowhere near keeping up with his train of thought, my mind still obsessing over the strange knowledge that my father had remarried. When? Why? Did he treat this strange woman better than he had my poor abused mother? The woman was alive, so clearly he did.</p><p>In spite of my body\u2019s exhaustion, my mind became too busy for sleep after that. James cleaned us both, even wiping away my makeup before turning out the lights and spooning in behind me. His presence was soothing, but I still worried over the surprising news for a long time before finally drifting into a restless sleep.</p><p>I was in that house again. I lay in my hard, tiny bed. I was hugging my knees to my chest, rocking and rocking, and trying to ignore the harsh shouts just a few thin walls away. If I stayed in my room, it would all go away. They would forget I was even here and in the morning my Dad would sleep all day and leave us in peace so I could tend to my Mother.</p><p>But that wasn\u2019t meant to be. Not this time. The yelling grew louder, my mothers turning into terrified screams.</p><p>When I couldn\u2019t stand the horrible noises a moment longer, I crept quietly through the house to investigate. In spite of my overwhelming fear, my need to at least attempt to aid my mother almost always thrust me into the violent thick of things.</p><p>I looked down at my thin bare feet, wishing I knew where some clean socks were. I was so cold, an achy kind of cold, down to my very soul.</p><p>My parents were speaking in Swedish, and I pieced together some hysterical words as I got closer to the kitchen where they fought. \u201cNo, no, no. Please, Sven, put that away.\u201d</p><p>My father\u2019s voice was an angry roar. \u201cYou\u2019ve ruined my life. You and that brat. I\u2019ve lost everything because of you. My fortune, my inheritance, and now, my luck. You\u2019ve taken everything from me, just by living. Tell me why I shouldn\u2019t take everything from you, you silly cunt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re sober, you\u2019ll regret it. We have a child together, Sven. Please, just go to sleep. If you sleep on it, you\u2019ll feel better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare tell me what to do! Fuck sleep. Fuck you. And fuck that little brat. Look at her, hovering in the door, frozen like a little mouse.\u201d His cold eyes went to me.</p><p>I was frozen in place, as he\u2019d said. He changed his tone when he spoke to me, and it turned into a mockery of a gentle tone. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you join us, sotnos? Come be with your pretty Mama.\u201d</p><p>I moved to my mother, having learned a very long time ago not to disobey him when he was in this mood.</p><p>He sneered at the two of us when I stood beside her. He towered over us. My mother didn\u2019t look at me, didn\u2019t reach for me. I knew she didn\u2019t want to draw more attention to me. She tried to protect me, as I did her. \u201cLook at my pretty girls. The daughter is even prettier than the mother. What use, then, is the mother? Tell me why you\u2019re useful, Mama?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>I didn\u2019t hear her answer. My gaze was focused solely now on the object he was holding at his side. It was a gun. My gut clenched in dread. The gun was a new and terrifying addition to this violent scene.</p><p>My gaze flew back to my father\u2019s face as a laugh left his throat. It was a cackle of a laugh, dry and angry.</p><p>I began to back away, shaking my head back and forth in denial.</p><p>\u201cWrong answer, cunt,\u201d he said.</p><p>He waved the the pistol in front of her. \u201cYou can\u2019t take your eyes off of this. Do you want it? Would you like me to give this to you? Take it, if you want it. You think I can\u2019t touch you with a gun in your hand?\u201d</p><p>My mother watched him, her eyes almost blank with terror. She must know, as I did, from the mocking tone of his voice, that he was testing her. She would pay dearly if she took the gun from him, even if he had told her to.</p><p>He laughed. \u201cI insist. Take the gun.\u201d</p><p>Unexpectedly, and horrifyingly, she did. She pointed it at him with hands that shook. \u201cGet out,\u201d she said, her voice tremulous and awful with her terror. \u201cYou can\u2019t do these things, especially in front of our daughter. Get out, and don\u2019t come back.\u201d She was sobbing, but she managed to pull the hammer back.</p><p>He laughed again. With no fear and no effort, he grabbed her hand. His hand covered one of hers, ripping the other one away. He turned the gun, slowly and inexorably pointing it away from himself and pushing it into her mouth.</p><p>I had backed myself against the wall as I watched their exchange, but when I saw his clear intent, I suddenly rushed forward, sobbing, \u201cMama.\u201d</p><p>I stopped as though I\u2019d run into a wall when my father pulled the trigger, covering us and the entire room in obscene amounts of glowing crimson blood and gore.</p><p>My horrified eyes met my father\u2019s. His showed no expression at all.</p><p>I awoke to total darkness, a harsh scream caught in my throat. I had no notion of where I was and I began to scramble off of the huge, soft bed, fumbling around in the pitch blackness for a wall, a lamp, a light switch, anything. I needed to wash the blood off. I was feeling along the wall and sobbing like a child when light suddenly flooded the room. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I finally got an inkling of where I was as James rushed to me, cradling me into his chest. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Bianca? What can I do?\u201d</p><p>I gasped in several breaths before I could speak. \u201cShower. I need a shower. I need to wash the blood off.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t ask anymore questions, getting us both into the shower in a flash. He turned the water directly onto me, and the cold water that hit me for just moments before it began to warm helped bring me a few steps further away from the dream.</p><p>Slowly, my broken sobs turned into gasping breaths as I became clean in the water, my mind moving further and further out of the nightmare realm.</p> <p>\u201cCan you talk about it?\u201d James asked. His voice was so vulnerable with his concern for me that I couldn\u2019t resist him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the same old dream about my mother\u2019s death. I was in that room, not three feet from her, when it happened.\u201d I felt the floodgates open, and I told him everything, every gory detail, of both the dream and the horrific event. He didn\u2019t speak at all, just made sympathetic noises and gave me reassuring touches while I spoke. I was surprised to feel much better when I\u2019d gotten it all out. It had actually helped to tell him about it.</p><p>He helped me out of the shower and dried us both off. We lay in a naked snuggle on the bed with only a sheet covering us. He was on his back and had pulled me almost on top of him.</p><p>I rubbed my cheek over my name on his chest as he stroked my wet hair back, arranging it over his arm.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve done all you can. You told the police everything you saw. It\u2019s not your burden anymore, Bianca.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, I know. I haven\u2019t had that nightmare since that other time, over a month ago. I think it was learning about her, his wife, that got my mind back into that dark place again. I need to tell her what he did, to warn her. I don\u2019t know the woman, but she deserves that much. Lord, I don\u2019t want to speak to her. I don\u2019t want anything to do with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could always just send her an email, or hell, a letter. You don\u2019t have to do anything you don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>I mulled that over. It seemed so cowardly to be afraid of a simple phone call. \u201cI\u2019ll call her tomorrow,\u201d</p><p>I decided.</p><p>His arms tightened on me, his hold becoming almost painful. It was comforting to my twisted senses. \u201cI need to stay in New York this week. Will you come back to be with me on your first day off?\u201d</p><p>I thought about it. It didn\u2019t take me long. \u201cYes. Do you mind if I invite Stephan? You have plenty of room, after all.\u201d</p> <p>I had felt all of the anxious tension leave his body when I agreed to come. \u201cWe have plenty of room,\u201d he chastised. \u201cAnd yes, of course. Invite Javier, too, if you like. Or anyone you want, for that matter. I\u2019ll have to work quite a bit anyways. I\u2019ve been putting some important meetings off that need tending to.</p><p>And god only knows what a mess my New York management has made of things on the Manhattan property. I would feel better if you had someone to hang out with while I\u2019m working. I wouldn\u2019t want you to get bored, though you do have a studio set up for painting downstairs. I never had time to show you. We never seem to have enough time. How many days can you take off this week?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can fly into New York Monday morning, and take a flight back on Thursday. I can take a week off from working overtime.\u201d</p><p>I began to wonder if Stephan could work his own overtime with Javier, instead of me. My boyfriend was filthy rich. It seemed silly not to at least keep my days off.</p><p>My stance had changed so drastically from just a week ago that I felt almost dizzy with it. Instead of intending to continue my life exactly as I pleased, I found myself wanting to compromise to please James, and of course, to see more of him.</p><p>He gave me a soft kiss for my concession. \u201cI would love that. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>I sighed, plunging in deeper. \u201cIt seems ridiculous to work overtime anymore, everything considered.</p><p>My straight time can more than cover my mortgage and food, and you bought me enough clothing to last a lifetime. I\u2019m going to see if Stephan will work his extra shifts with Javier. I\u2019d be willing to bet he won\u2019t mind the idea.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he said with quiet sincerity. \u201cI\u2019ll make sure to make it worth your while.\u201d</p><p>I burrowed against him, feeling good. Good about him. Good about us. \u201cYou already have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou make me so happy, Bianca. I never knew life could be this good. I\u2019ve been alone for so long, since my parents died, really. But I don\u2019t feel alone with you. I feel like I have a family and a home again. You\u2019re my home. All of the dark shadows seem to disappear when we\u2019re together.\u201d</p><p>I placed a kiss on my name over his heart, feeling myself drifting off. I didn\u2019t even know what time it was, but I wasn\u2019t worried. I knew James wouldn\u2019t let me oversleep. More and more, I just trusted him.</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTY-SEVEN</p><p>I couldn\u2019t stop yawning as I got ready for work the next morning. James woke up with me, in spite of the ungodly hour. He was alert but quiet as we both got dressed. He wore an elegant pale gray suit. It was so pale it almost looked white at first glance.</p><p>He paired it with a brilliant turquoise dress shirt with a stark white collar. A skinny tie as white as the collar hung to his pale gray belt. The pant legs were very narrow and fitted, and he\u2019d chosen faded gray lace-up dress shoes. The full effect was devastating. Only James could have pulled it off.</p><p>He approached me from behind as I shrugged into my uniform dress shirt. He held up a tiny silver object in front of my face. It took me a moment to place it as a small lock. \u201cMay I lock on your collar now?\u201d</p><p>I stiffened, but tilted my head forward to give him access. \u201cYes,\u201d I said.</p><p>For better or worse, I had made my decision.</p><p>He locked it on quickly, placing a soft kiss to my nape. \u201cTurn around,\u201d he told me. I did, and he was holding the key on a chain around his own neck. He tucked it under his shirt as I watched. \u201cThere will be security at your house. Please cooperate with them. They\u2019re there to keep you safe.\u201d</p><p>I just nodded. I knew better than anyone that I wasn\u2019t safe, and I was grateful for the extra protection.</p><p>He rode in the town car with me to the crew hotel. He gripped me tightly to his side and buried his face in my hair. \u201cThis is harder than I thought it would be, letting you go like this,\u201d he murmured into my hair.</p><p>I rubbed a hand over the spot over his heart where he\u2019d etched my name. I knew that the action comforted us both. \u201cIt\u2019s only for a few days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall or text me when you land, and again when you\u2019re safely in your house. I\u2019ll worry if you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, the motion rubbing his face against the back of my hair.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t kiss you goodbye, Love. If I start, I know I\u2019ll never stop.\u201d</p><p>I nodded again. I understood the odd sentiment. Instead, when the car stopped in front of my crew hotel, I held his elegant hand to my lips, kissing the palm and then moving my lips over the faint thin scars on his wrist, placing a soft kiss there as well, and then moving my lips back into his palm, allowing myself just a moment to nuzzle against it.</p><p>He made a soft little sound in his throat that made it so hard to get out of the car. He caught my hand as I was about to move away and copied the motion on my own wrist and palm. It was sheer agony to walk away from him. I didn\u2019t look back. I knew that would only make it worse.</p><p>Only Stephan and Javier were in the lobby when I walked in, Stephan in his uniform, Javier dressed business casual in a lavender dress shirt and beige slacks.</p><p>I was five minutes early, I saw as I checked my watch. Stephan grinned when he saw me, striding over to hug me tightly. \u201cI missed you, Buttercup.\u201d</p><p>I hugged him back, just as tightly. \u201cWe have so much to talk about, but I needed to ask you and Javier something.\u201d</p><p>Javier approached us rather cautiously, as though afraid to interrupt our reunion. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d Stephan asked.</p><p>\u201cHow would you like to stay in the swankest pad in New York for our days off this week? Most likely we\u2019d fly in Monday morning and stay until early Thursday.\u201d</p><p>Stephan\u2019s grin grew even wider. \u201cI can\u2019t think of anything I\u2019d love more. I take it this means you and James are working things out?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, smiling and looking up into his eyes. I let him see all of my happiness but none of my troubles. It was what he deserved.</p><p>Javier cleared his throat. \u201cUm, so, did you mean just for Stephan, or...\u201d</p><p>I gave him a friendly smile. \u201cI meant for the two of you to come, if you want to. James has an obscene amount of room, considering that it\u2019s in Manhattan.\u201d</p><p>Stephan cleared his throat, shooting Javier a positively wicked glance. I could have sworn Javier blushed just a tad even through his lovely pale mocha skin. \u201cJavier and I only need one room regardless.\u201d</p><p>I blinked. That was moving incredibly fast, for Stephan. I took it as a good sign. He seemed to be more comfortable by the minute about being in an open relationship with a man.</p><p>\u201cI had one more thing I wanted to talk to both of you about. I\u2019ve decided to stop working so much overtime and just stick with my regular shifts, for the most part. I hope you don\u2019t mind losing your overtime partner.\u201d</p><p>Stephan didn\u2019t look in the least perturbed. \u201cAbout damn time, Bee. I figured you would be catching on to that soon enough. I already asked Javier if he wanted to be my new overtime buddy. He\u2019s doing some trades to share our days off, so it should work out perfectly.\u201d As Stephan spoke he stroked a hand over Javier\u2019s jet black hair.</p><p>Javier closed his eyes, as though savoring the light touch. I didn\u2019t know if it was just the only thing I knew with my limited experience with relationships, but it looked to me like Javier was clearly Stephan\u2019s submissive. The way he closed his eyes, his hands in his pockets to keep from touching back, just reminded me so much of an act of submission. Stephan\u2019s hand moved down to rub at a spot on Javier\u2019s thin, straight shoulders. Javier let out a pleased little moan. I thought they were beautiful together.</p><p>\u201cThe crew bus is here. Let\u2019s load up,\u201d Stephan said, releasing Javier.</p><p>We filed out, handing our luggage to the driver, who loaded it into the baggage compartments mounted along the bottom of the mini-shuttle. \u201cFive more coming,\u201d Stephan told the driver, climbing inside.</p><p>Stephan and Javier took the backseat, and I sat on the row just in front of them. \u201cBianca, be our lookout,\u201d Stephan said rather cryptically. I turned to look at them. I was as shocked as I\u2019d ever been by what I saw.</p><p>Stephan had a flushed Javier pinned down on the bench seat beneath them. He was straddling the smaller man and giving him a very intense, very heated look. He held the other man\u2019s wrists pinned tautly above his head. As I watched he bent down and kissed him. It was not a casual kiss but a rough one, and I knew dominance when I saw it. My shocked gaze flew out the window as I suddenly realized that I was the lookout, and that I actually needed to do the job considering the things going on in the backseat.</p><p>I heard Stephan murmuring something to Javier, and I could hear that whatever it was was muffled against some part of the other man\u2019s skin. \u201cBianca, do you suppose you could manage ten minutes without me on the flight?\u201d Stephan addressed me. \u201cI know it\u2019s going to be hectic, but I would really appreciate it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOf course,\u201d I answered without hesitation.</p><p>\u201cSee. I told you she would. Three hours, tops, and I\u2019ll take you again. I\u2019m not that much of a tease,\u201d</p><p>Stephan said in a low voice to Javier. It made me blush down to my toes, but I stayed alertly watching out the window.</p><p>\u201cYou are a tease,\u201d Javier muttered, sounding sullen. \u201cThree hours is forever.\u201d</p> <p>I spotted the pilots in the lobby. \u201cPilots incoming,\u201d I said, sounding a little panicked even to my own ears.</p><p>Stephan sat up, releasing Javier. I glanced back at Stephan. He grinned at me shamelessly. I couldn\u2019t help it. I grinned back. Javier looked more perturbed but still happy. His blush was like a happy glow around him. His words hadn\u2019t shown me that, but his face did. He gave me a shy smile. \u201cSorry,\u201d he muttered to me.</p><p>I smiled back. \u201cDon\u2019t be sorry. I\u2019ve never seen Stephan like this. I think you guys are beautiful together.\u201d</p><p>That made him truly glow. Javier had it bad. It took one to know one, and I knew that lovesick look because a certain Mr. Beautiful had the same effect on me. I was relieved to see it. I wanted Javier to feel that kind of love for Stephan. He wouldn\u2019t want to hurt someone he loved that much.</p><p>\u201cQuit making him blush, Bianca. That\u2019s my job,\u201d Stephan said, ruffling Javier\u2019s hair affectionately.</p> <p>Sure enough, Javier blushed harder.</p><p>I turned around, shaking my head with a strange smile on my face. I had never seen this side of Stephan, didn\u2019t know he had it in him.</p><p>The Saturday morning flight into Vegas was hectic, as it always was. Stephan took his ten minutes with the meeting with Javier in the bathroom that I had expected. Both men emerged looking flushed and happy. We all grinned at each other like fools before Stephan and I got back to work and Javier returned to his seat.</p><p>Stephan and I clutched hands as we landed, grinning at each other. We didn\u2019t say much, just enjoying the moment.</p><p>I texted James as we taxied in.</p><p>Bianca: Just landed in Vegas. How r u?</p> <p>James: Fine. Keeping busy with work, but still missing you like crazy.</p><p>I hesitated, then just said to hell with it.</p><p>Bianca: I miss you too.</p><p>James: Call me when you get to your house.</p><p>I put my phone away after that, since I\u2019d be contacting him again soon enough.</p><p>The drive home was a jovial affair, with Stephan and Javier smiling about just about everything. My expression matched theirs. I couldn\u2019t seem to help myself.</p><p>I was met at my front door by the security guard, Paterson. A woman I\u2019d never met before was standing beside him, looking grim. She was short and stocky, and I knew at a glance that she was a tough woman.</p><p>She had dark hair held back in a short, no-nonsense braid. Her face was round and pale, but her eyes were hard and assessing. She didn\u2019t wear a scrap of makeup, I doubted she ever did, and her mouth was set in a grim line.</p> <p>Her body could have been bulky or just big-boned. It was impossible to say with the baggy, short- sleeved mens button-up shirt she was wearing over wide-legged slacks. She was like the agents, in her own way. Just looking at her made you think of law enforcement.</p><p>Paterson gave me a polite nod as I approached my front door. I could feel Stephan hovering behind me.</p><p>I didn\u2019t have to ask to know that he wouldn\u2019t leave until he knew I was settled into my house, safe and secure. He had done so ever since the attack.</p><p>\u201cMs. Karlsson, this is Blake. She\u2019s new to the team, but I\u2019ve known her for years. She\u2019s the best.</p><p>She\u2019ll be your personal bodyguard detail for public excursions. It\u2019s been very clearly brought to my attention that I had overlooked your security in public restrooms.\u201d</p><p>I flushed, recalling the incident in the restroom. Of course James would take extra measures after that. I should have seen it coming. I nodded to Blake. \u201cNice to meet you, Blake,\u201d I said. I wouldn\u2019t protest the extra security. I certainly couldn\u2019t argue that I needed it.</p><p>She nodded back solemnly. \u201cA pleasure, Ms. Karlsson.\u201d</p><p>I wondered if I could get her to call me by my first name. I had sort of given up on trying that with the security after Clark. He\u2019d stubbornly refused in spite of my prompting.</p><p>\u201cPlease, allow us to secure the house before you proceed inside,\u201d she said solemnly.</p><p>I nodded, unlocking the door and going inside to punch in the security code. Both Paterson and Blake sucked in a breath when I stepped into the house first. I saw how I had erred, and apologized. The least I could do for my bodyguards was make it easy for them to do their job. \u201cI\u2019ll get you guys some copies of my keys and give you my security codes to make it easier.\u201d</p><p>Paterson cleared his throat, but it was Stephan that spoke. \u201cI already did, Bee. I got copies for them, and for James.\u201d</p><p>I imagined that they were all holding their breath, waiting for me to throw some kind of tantrum, but I wasn\u2019t unreasonable. Stephan might have been a tad premature, but it was only a convenience at this point. \u201cThank you,\u201d I said. I thought I heard all three of them let out relieved breaths. What has the security team been told about me? I wondered.</p><p>Paterson and Blake asked me to stay near the front entrance while Blake hovered near me and Paterson did a rather long search of the house. I was too distracted by the new additions to my living room to care much. A Mac with a large screen had taken residence in the spot where my old computer had been. I just stared at it for awhile, blinking, my tired mind blank. \u201cWhat happened to my old computer?\u201d I asked out loud.</p><p>Stephan answered. \u201cIt\u2019s gone. That one has everything you need. I wiped the other one and put everything on this one for you. James asked me to do it so he wouldn\u2019t have to hire a stranger to go through your computer.\u201d His voice held a sheepish apology.</p><p>I sighed, becoming more and more resigned to James\u2019s constant need to buy me things. \u201cThat was nice of you. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t mad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt seems silly to get mad about getting a new computer, doesn\u2019t it? I\u2019m growing accustomed to this sort of thing.\u201d I looked at Stephan as I spoke.</p><p>He grinned at me. \u201cIt was no trouble at all. James bought me one, too.\u201d</p><p>I thought of all the things I needed to tell him. There just hadn\u2019t been any time. \u201cI have so much to tell you. Will you come over tonight?\u201d Javier had already gone to Stephan\u2019s house and was waiting for him.</p><p>The two men seemed inseparable. \u201cCan we get a little while to talk, just the two of us? Then we could have dinner with Javier, unless you two want to be alone.\u201d It felt awkward to have to request his exclusive company, but I told myself to get used to it.</p><p>He gave me a chastising look. \u201cOf course. I\u2019ll come over right after a nap. Just text me when you wake up. And yes, we\u2019ll all have dinner. At my place. I\u2019ll cook. I\u2019ve missed you, Bee. I know I need to get used to it, but just a few days without you is tough. You never have to ask when you want to spend time with me. You give me the time and the place and I\u2019ll be there. Always.\u201d</p><p>I moved to him, and he opened his arms. I walked right into them, barely aware that we weren\u2019t alone.</p><p>His words had touched an emotional chord in me. \u201cGo get some sleep. As you can see, I\u2019m in good hands. I\u2019ll text you when I wake up.\u201d</p><p>He kissed the top of my head. \u201cGood night,\u201d he murmured. I walked him to the door.</p><p>Blake was studying me when I turned back into the room. She quickly schooled her face into a carefully blank expression.</p><p>\u201cAll clear,\u201d Paterson said as he strode back into the room. He addressed me, \u201cIf you have any problems, any problems at all, one of us will be right across the street, in a black SUV, at all times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a spare room. I don\u2019t mind if you guys want to sleep in there. There\u2019s only a twin bed, but it\u2019s better than sleeping in a car.\u201d</p><p>Paterson and Blake shared a look, but not before I saw the surprise in both of their eyes.</p><p>\u201cThank you for the kind offer, Ms. Karlsson,\u201d Blake said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll discuss it with Mr. Cavendish,\u201d Paterson said.</p><p>Of course control freak Cavendish would have the rule that he had to approve all decisions.</p><p>Paterson cleared his throat. \u201cMr. Cavendish has also asked me to tell you to please answer your phone.\u201d Paterson\u2019s voice was carefully polite, but I\u2019d have been willing to bet that James hadn\u2019t been when he made the request. My phone was buried somewhere in my flight bag and I dreaded seeing how many calls I had missed since I\u2019d left the plane.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, please. I need to go take a nap,\u201d I told the two security guards awkwardly. I wasn\u2019t used to having staff, and my first instinct was to treat them as guests in my home.</p><p>They both nodded rather deferentially, as though it had been taught to them amidst all of the other training they must have been through. \u201cAs I said, we\u2019ll be just outside. And my number is in your phone, under \u2018Security.\u2019\u201d</p><p>I thanked them both politely before I went into my room, shutting my door gratefully behind me. I meant to call James, my mind was on him even as I got half undressed and fell facedown on top of my covers.</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTY-EIGHT</p><p>A barrage of strange noises woke me up. It took me long disoriented minutes to sort them all out.</p><p>The most persistent noise came from my bedside table, in the form of an Ipad I hadn\u2019t even known existed. I recognized the thin object, but I certainly didn\u2019t know what one was doing in my bedroom, or how I hadn\u2019t noticed it before I went to sleep. I had passed out rather quickly, I remembered. It was letting out a loud chiming noise, over and over again.</p><p>I decided that wasn\u2019t my biggest problem as someone knocked, rather frantically, at my bedroom door. I felt fear curl in my stomach until I realized that any real threat would hardly be knocking at an unlocked door.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d I called, my voice still full of sleep.</p><p>The door burst open and Blake stood framed in it. She had apparently taken my yes as an invitation to enter. Her eyes darted around my room, looking for threats. When she deducted that there was none, her eyes shifted to me. She quickly looked away uncomfortably.</p><p>I realized that I was basically naked, wearing only a pair of panties and one errant stocking. I had managed to pull a corner of the covers over most of my torso in my sleep, thank god, but it was obvious that I was nearly naked underneath.</p><p>A muffled sound from my flight bag drew my attention briefly, and a I realized that my phone had been going off constantly, just like the the mysterious Ipad.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d I asked Blake. I figured she had to have a better idea than I did.</p><p>\u201cMr. Cavendish has been unable to get ahold of you. He was...concerned. He said you were supposed to contact him when you got to your home, and you did not.\u201d Her voice held a world of condemnation, as though forgetting to make a phone call were the worst sort of offense.</p><p>I studied her. She wore only a tight navy T-shirt and athletic shorts, her shoulder holster and gun clearly visible. I realized that instead of being stocky, as I\u2019d originally thought, her figure was solidly covered in stark muscles. I couldn\u2019t remember ever seeing a woman quite so ripped up with muscle. She could have been a female body builder. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI just sort of passed out. I guess I was more tired than I realized.\u201d</p><p>She sighed heavily. \u201cWell, please call Mr. Cavendish now. He\u2019s more than a little upset.\u201d</p><p>Before I could respond, a shirtless and disheveled Stephan appeared behind Blake, looking distraught.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay, Bee? James just woke me up. He\u2019s frantic, says you were supposed to call him hours ago and he hasn\u2019t been able to get ahold of you. He\u2019s got me feeling guilty for falling asleep before making you call him.\u201d As he spoke, Stephan brushed past Blake to my bed. He climbed in with me wearing only his boxers, stroking a hand over my hair. I thought Blake\u2019s eyes were going to bulge out of her head.</p> <p>\u201cThat is highly inappropriate, Mr. Davis. I would ask that you please remove yourself from Ms.</p><p>Karlsson\u2019s bed.\u201d</p><p>I gave her a baffled look. Stephan\u2019s was downright unfriendly. \u201cStephan is my adopted brother,\u201d I explained to Blake, even though we didn\u2019t owe her an explanation. Still, I didn\u2019t see the need for her to get the wrong idea. And he really was my adopted brother, if not technically than at least emotionally.</p><p>She looked relieved. \u201cThat is a relief. Still, I will have to report this to Mr. Cavendish. Just so you know.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. Stephan leaned over and kissed me on the forehead. \u201cI\u2019m going back to bed, Buttercup.</p> <p>Call James before he gets on a plane.\u201d</p><p>Stephan left, but Blake still hovered in the doorway.</p><p>I began to get annoyed, as much with James as with my stern bodyguard. \u201cI got it. I\u2019ll call James as soon as you give me some privacy.\u201d I felt rude even as the words left my mouth, but she just nodded and left.</p><p>I opened the pumpkin orange case of the chiming Ipad, sitting up as I did so. I was startled to see myself topless for an endless moment before an image of James, dressed in the suit I had said goodbye to him in that morning, and with a huge window with a killer view of New York in the background, took over most of the screen. He looked wild, his hair disheveled as though he\u2019d run his through it impatiently. The curl of his pretty mouth gave me a good idea of his dark mood.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you call me when you said you would? And why are you topless?\u201d he asked. His tone was harsh, and I saw not an ounce of softness in his angry face.</p><p>\u201cI fell asleep before I realized it. I didn\u2019t mean to. I had no idea I was so tired.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou said you would call. Are you toying with me? Is that what this is? Do you like to drive me wild?\u201d</p><p>I let my annoyance show clearly on my face. \u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous. It\u2019s exactly what I said, and you\u2019re overreacting. Obviously I was fine. You have this whole place patrolled day and night. What did you think had happened?\u201d</p><p>His jaw clenched hard enough that it looked like it hurt. \u201cI don\u2019t know. And not knowing is worse than just about anything. You might have been mad at me again, or freaked out that you\u2019d agreed to live with me. Perhaps you were leaving me again. And in the back of my mind, I was even worried that your father had somehow gotten ahold of you again.\u201d He didn\u2019t bother to hide his vulnerability during his little tirade, and I felt myself involuntarily softening towards him. It was a talent of his.</p><p>I sighed. \u201cOh, James. I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t call when I said I would, but I wasn\u2019t being deliberately hurtful. I was just more exhausted than I realized by the time Paterson had finished searching my house. I barely got undressed before I passed out.\u201d</p><p>His face went a little slack and I saw his gaze shift down to my naked breasts. They\u2019d been uncovered when I\u2019d sat up in bed. He swallowed. I felt a surge of unadulterated lust shoot through my body. \u201cI see that. I\u2019m sorry I overreacted. You\u2019re more precious than my own life to me, Bianca, and knowing that you\u2019re safe and sound is my first priority.\u201d</p><p>I felt my face, hell, my whole body, soften. He said the sweetest things to me, the most romantic things.</p><p>I tried to remind myself that he\u2019d never once told me that he loved me, but still I felt that raw emotion for him like a drug to my system.</p><p>\u201cI miss you,\u201d I told him softly.</p> <p>His lids got very heavy. \u201cI can\u2019t wait for Monday. Is your bottom half as naked as your top half?\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help it, I blushed. \u201cAre you in your office? On a Saturday?\u201d</p><p>His pretty mouth twisted into a wry smile. \u201cYes, though I\u2019m quite alone. The hotel industry is a seven day a week business. Don\u2019t change the subject. Shift the camera down for me. I want to see what you\u2019re wearing.\u201d</p><p>I blushed harder, but I did as he said. It was just more natural to obey him than to fight him when he spoke like that. I showed him my lower half, my lap covered in a thin blanket, my one stockinged leg clearly exposed. I couldn\u2019t see his face anymore with the way the screen was angled. \u201cTake off the cover.\u201d</p><p>I removed it, showing him the tiny scrap of nude-colored underwear I wore. I heard his guttural moan of approval and let my legs fall open.</p><p>\u201cUse the magnetic cover to prop the Ipad up on your bedside table. Point it at the bed.\u201d</p><p>I did, seeing him clearly again. He had rearranged himself as well, pushing his chair far enough back from the desk so that I could see his lap.</p><p>He was still fully dressed but I could see his stark erection tenting his pale gray slacks obscenely. As I watched him he opened up his pants, using both hands to pull his naked cock free. It sprang out and up with a little bounce that made me gasp.</p><p>He shifted, pulling his slacks down far enough to give it total freedom. He unbuttoned the last three buttons on his shirt, pulling it open wide. He threw his long thin white tie over his shoulder and out of his way. I had an unobstructed view of his hands as he stroked himself. \u201cTake off your panties and lie back on the bed.\u201d</p><p>I obeyed, my face turning pink all the while.</p><p>\u201cProp yourself up on the pillows and open your legs wide. Wider. Open yourself for me. Perfect, yes, just like that. Push two fingers inside of you. Deeper. Yes. Reach a hand up to cup your breast. Knead around it, but don\u2019t touch the nipple.\u201d As he spoke and I acquiesced to his demands, he stroked himself with hard, almost brutal thoroughness. \u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful, Bianca. Every inch of you is perfection. I can see the moisture between your legs. It\u2019s the hottest fucking thing I\u2019ve ever seen in my life. Stroke yourself harder and faster. Imitate me fucking you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the same,\u201d I gasped, stroking myself faster and faster. It wasn\u2019t at all the same as him touching me, a sad imitation in fact, but I was still getting close to orgasm, more from his voice and the sight of his beautiful hands on that perfect cock than from what I was clumsily doing to myself.</p><p>He gave me a pained smile. \u201cI know it\u2019s not. Not even close. We shouldn\u2019t be separated like this. Not ever. But we\u2019ll work with what we\u2019ve been given. Now move that hand on your lovely tit down to your clit. Yes, perfect. Rub very soft, small circles on it with your finger. Tell me when you\u2019re close, my love. I could come on a dime, and I want us to go at the same moment. Mmm, there, shove those fingers in as hard and fast as you can manage. If we get separated like this often, we\u2019ll have to get you a vibrator for your house. Or a dildo that\u2019s a perfect replica of my dick.\u201d</p><p>His voice and his words brought me closer and closer to the edge as I watched him work himself so roughly with his hands. The sight of him touching himself was incredibly erotic to me. \u201cI\u2019m close,\u201d I gasped to him.</p><p>He bit his lip as he wrenched at himself. His neck arched but his eyes never left me as he came into his hand with a rough little groan. The sight of him coming in spurts that hit nothing but air brought me with him, and I gave a little whimper as my orgasm took me. It felt good, but nowhere near as intense as where James usually brought me. I sat up and watched in fascination as he cleaned up the mess he had made, giving me a self-deprecating smile all the while.</p><p>\u201cWas it good for you, Love?\u201d he asked, his eyes tender in spite of that smile.</p><p>I wanted to cry for some strange reason. I didn\u2019t want to analyze the urge at all, but I couldn\u2019t help but worry about how much I was coming to depend on James. I felt an addictive need to be near him. \u201cIt was good. I loved watching you touch yourself, but it all just made me want you with me even more.\u201d</p><p>His face changed so drastically that I blinked. There was a calculation there now, and a resolve that made me tense. \u201cWe don\u2019t ever have to be apart. You could work from home, and have a career with your paintings. I won\u2019t rush you, but it\u2019s something I\u2019d like you to start thinking about.\u201d</p><p>I tensed up even more, and he held up a conciliatory hand. \u201cI\u2019ll drop it, love. Paterson tells me that you offered to let Blake sleep in your spare room. Are you really okay with that? For security purposes it would be ideal, but I want you to be comfortable in your own home.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged, and his eyes moved down to my breasts. He began to tuck himself back into his slacks, making a visible effort to tear his eyes back up to my face. I wasn\u2019t totally comfortable with it, but I thought that with all of the other bizarre things I would need to grow accustomed to, it was a very little thing in the scheme of it all.</p><p>He gave me an almost grateful smile. It looked a little off on his too perfect face. \u201cThank you. That will help me to sleep better when you have to be away from me.\u201d I shifted as he spoke, sitting cross- legged and pulling a corner of my bedspread over my lap. His smile changed to a smirk. \u201cTake the blanket off your lap. I love the one stocking, by the way. You really passed out, huh?\u201d</p><p>We chatted for a long time, both of us in a lighter mood by the time he finally had to get back to work. I wondered how my heart could be both light with happiness and heavy with love at the same time.</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTY-NINE</p><p>I was heading from my bedroom to the kitchen, clad only in a robe, when I heard a commotion at my front door. I moved to see what it was before I could think better of it. I blinked at the unexpected sight that greeted me.</p><p>A strange, middle-aged woman stood just in the front doorway, Paterson behind her, Blake in front. She had hair dyed a garish red, with overdone makeup that couldn\u2019t disguise the drawn look of her too thin face. She looked how I thought a retired showgirl might look, with a thin body and too large breasts that seemed to hurt her posture.</p><p>Her spine stiffened when she caught sight of me. Her eyes were neither friendly nor hostile, but held a desperate sort of appeal that I couldn\u2019t understand showing to a complete stranger.</p><p>She addressed me right away. \u201cI\u2019m not here to hurt you, as these people seem to think.\u201d She held up a plain white envelope. \u201cI just wanted to give you this. There are some things you need to know. I would have told you before, but your father wouldn\u2019t let me contact you. Now that he\u2019s disappeared, I saw no reason to delay. Please, just read this. I can see why you wouldn\u2019t want to talk to me, but this isn\u2019t about me.\u201d Her speech was a little desperate, and I recognized the nervous fear that seemed to sit on her shoulders, a fear that she had to live with every second of her life, living with my father. I remembered it well. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSharon Karlsson,\u201d I said, my mouth stiff around the words. The name felt so wrong to me.</p><p>She nodded, her arm shaking badly as she held the envelope towards me. I moved forward to take it.</p><p>Blake moved to block me. \u201cShe hasn\u2019t let us search her, Ms. Karlsson.\u201d</p><p>I studied Sharon. She wore a thin shift of a dress, flowers faded from many washes. I didn\u2019t see how she could hide anything in the dress, but I wasn\u2019t the expert. \u201cWill you hand me the envelope then?\u201d I asked Blake, trying to be practical.</p> <p>Blake took the envelope from Sharon, and the red-headed woman began backing immediately out the door. I remembered that I had something to tell her but she was retreating swiftly. I had to shoulder past my bodyguards to catch a last view of her getting into an old clunker of a sedan that was parked on the curb.</p><p>\u201cWait, Sharon,\u201d I called out. She cast me a panicky look, but didn\u2019t pause. I moved closer. \u201cI need to tell you something important,\u201d I shouted, but she was already peeling away from my house like a madwoman.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Ms. Karlsson. Step back inside. It could be some kind of a trap,\u201d Paterson said, scanning the street with focused thoroughness.</p><p>I cooperated, walking back inside with a sigh. Now I would have to call her. I had so just wanted to get it over with. I had an almost overpoweringly strong aversion to speaking to that woman. I held my hand out to Blake as I passed her. \u201cMay I have that letter?\u201d</p><p>She looked hesitant but handed it to me.</p> <p>Paterson cleared his throat. \u201cMay I inspect it first, Ms. Karlsson?\u201d</p><p>I already had the thing open, and I could see that it contained nothing more than a thin scrap of paper. I showed him.</p><p>He grimaced, holding out his hand. \u201cI\u2019m asking to read it first.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. I would cooperate with them for the sake of my safety, but I had no intention of sharing my personal business with them. \u201cNo. I\u2019m sorry, but this is private.\u201d I went into my bedroom without another word.</p><p>I could hear Paterson\u2019s voice through the door. \u201cI\u2019m going to have to tell Mr. Cavendish about this, Ms.</p><p>Karlsson.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou do that,\u201d I said, opening the letter. It was short and to the point.</p><p>Bianca, I understand why you don\u2019t want anything to do with me, but I have a son. He is your half-brother, your father\u2019s son. He\u2019s only one year younger than you. His name is Sven Karlsson, and he lives in Manhattan. His phone number is at the bottom of the page. I think he would like to hear from you.</p><p>We have no other family, and he has been estranged from me and his father for several years.</p><p>Sincerely, Sharon Karlsson My vision went a little fuzzy after the first few sentences. I have a brother? Only a year younger than myself? The ramifications took long minutes to sink in as I sat perched on the edge of my bed.</p><p>I had been fourteen when my father had murdered my mother. He had been seeing this other woman the entire time, had a child with her. Is that why he had killed my mother? Had the shooting been even more calculated than I\u2019d realized?</p><p>I thought of my mother, my beautiful mother. That Sharon woman never could have held a candle to her, with her garish looks and lack of class, and she was obviously much older than my mother would be, if she were alive. My mother had been the very epitome of class, holding a quietly reserved grace in every line of her elegant body.</p><p>It seemed impossible that anyone would have killed such a woman, let alone for someone like Sharon. I found myself hating that woman with a passion usually only reserved for my father. But my half-brother... I had not a clue what to think about the idea of that.</p><p>My phone distracted me out of my reverie, though it had been ringing for awhile, I realized. I saw that it was James and answered it.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on, Bianca? Paterson tells me you wouldn\u2019t let him check a mysterious letter.\u201d His voice was more worried than angry but I still felt myself bristling.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my letter, James. And what harm could there be in a letter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho was that woman?\u201d</p><p>I sighed. Of course he\u2019d gotten a detailed report of everything. \u201cMy father\u2019s wife, Sharon Karlsson.\u201d</p><p>He cursed. \u201cWhat did she want?\u201d</p><p>I studied the short letter. \u201cNothing much. She was in full panic mode, so she didn\u2019t say much. I didn\u2019t get a chance to tell her anything, either, so now I have to call her. The sooner the better, so I need to let you go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait. What did the letter say?\u201d</p><p>I pursed my lips, debating what to tell him. Why not everything? His investigators probably knew more than I did, at this point. \u201cShe just wanted to tell me that I have a half-brother. She and my father have a son.\u201d</p><p>He was silent for a long moment. \u201cOkay. Thank you for telling me. I\u2019ll let you go so you can make that phone call. Will you call me before bed?\u201d I agreed to call him, and we hung up.</p><p>I went back to my missed calls, calling back the number that I knew was hers. It rang five times and went to voicemail. I was a breath away from just leaving her a message when I realized how that might endanger her. I couldn\u2019t say anything about my father or she might have to answer to him for it. I finally decided that any message from me would be bad, if my father had access, which he very well could have.</p><p>I tried calling her again, with the same result. I realized with resignation that I would have to keep calling her until I got the woman herself.</p><p>I had taken such a long nap that I found myself having dinner at Stephan\u2019s house just thirty minutes later, dressed in an overlarge T-shirt and cheer shorts. Stephan gave me an arch look when he saw my attire.</p><p>\u201cBet you wouldn\u2019t be caught dead wearing that when James was around.\u201d</p><p>I gave him a half smile as I moved into his house. \u201cJames isn\u2019t around, now, is he?\u201d</p><p>Stephan, Javier, and I had a very pleasant dinner, laughing and talking while we all ate too much of Stephan\u2019s chicken cacciatore. It was as fabulous as it always was, one of his best recipes by far.</p><p>After dinner Javier slipped away without an awkward moment to give us some privacy to chat. \u201cI need to make some phone calls,\u201d he murmured and slipped away. Stephan gave him a very affectionate smile.</p><p>We caught up on everything, nearly talking over each other to get it all out. He was shocked about my mysterious half-brother. I was shocked when he glanced at the doorway where Javier had exited then leaned forward to say in a whisper, \u201cI\u2019m totally in love with him, Bianca. I\u2019m in deep. I can\u2019t seem to help it, with Javier. Falling for him is just too easy, when I don\u2019t hold myself back.\u201d</p><p>His eyes were so earnest and vulnerable that I wanted to cry. I hoped with all my heart that it worked out for them. He sighed and smiled, happy to enjoy the moment, instead of analyzing it all to death like I seemed to. \u201cWhat about you? Do you think you love James?\u201d</p><p>I looked down at my hands. They were suddenly fisted in my lap. I nodded. \u201cHopelessly. I don\u2019t know about the rest of it, but I know I love him. Hell, I don\u2019t even know if he loves me back. I\u2019m not even sure he\u2019s capable of it, or if I\u2019m capable of letting him, you know?\u201d</p><p>His soft eyes just about undid me. \u201cOh, he loves you alright. I think he\u2019s loved you from the start. That man would do anything for you. I know it in my heart.\u201d</p><p>I thought about what a beautiful thing Stephan\u2019s heart was, to always see the good around the mess that it was buried in.</p><p>I wanted to ask him something, but even thinking about it made me blush. But Stephan and I had established a pattern of openness so long ago, that it was as ingrained in me as my love for him, so it wasn\u2019t long before I got up the nerve. \u201cYou and Javier seem to have a sort of, um, dominant submissive vibe going on. Is that how it is between you?\u201d</p><p>I studied his face, but saw no hesitance or embarrassment there. He just smiled happily. \u201cWe aren\u2019t into the BDSM stuff, if that\u2019s what you mean, but I\u2019m his top. We don\u2019t switch, not ever. It doesn\u2019t appeal to either of us.\u201d</p><p>He had explained the top/bottom thing to me a long time ago. He only ever topped. I had known that. I just hadn\u2019t connected his preference to a dominant/submissive relationship so clearly, though it obviously was just that.</p><p>Stephan cleared his throat. \u201cYou and James are into the BDSM stuff, aren\u2019t you? He\u2019s your dominant.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, meeting his eyes squarely, though I couldn\u2019t bring myself to smile, like he had. \u201cI know it\u2019s not...normal, but I\u2019ve found that it\u2019s just the way I\u2019m hardwired. And he mostly only acts that way in the bedroom. He really doesn\u2019t boss me around outside of it, though he does manipulate the hell out of my life.\u201d</p><p>He stroked my hair. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to explain your preferences to me. I want whatever makes you happy, and I see that James does that, when you let him. You weren\u2019t even slightly interested in men before you met him, so he obviously gives you something you need. I\u2019m glad you found someone who seems to compliment you so well.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, sighing in relief. I had been half-afraid that he would be mad at James if I told him about our strange sexual preferences, and it was good to know that he wouldn\u2019t judge us. I knew better, and as always, Stephan deserved only my blind my faith.</p><p>We finished out the night watching a few episodes of New Girl, the three of us laughing and eating ice cream. Stephan walked me home around ten o\u2019clock. My security was waiting for me, of course.</p><p>I called James, and we spoke for nearly an hour before we reluctantly said goodnight. It hadn\u2019t even been a day since we\u2019d parted, with just one more to go, but as I tried to fall asleep that night, it felt like forever.</p><p>CHAPTER FORTY</p><p>Work the next day was beyond busy, but still managed to feel like it took ages. We were actually running early on our hour layover in DC. I called James but he didn\u2019t answer. He had told me he had some important meetings that day, so I wasn\u2019t surprised. Just disappointed.</p><p>Stephan was speaking excitedly to Javier on his phone in the galley just before we boarded. He beamed at me as he hung up the phone. \u201cThe JFK flight is delayed two hours. If we keep running on time we can actually take the redeye flight tonight. Javier is going to meet us at the airport with my overnight bag.</p><p>James has things for you at his place, right?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, feeling suddenly light and happy. If everything worked out just perfectly, I would get to see James a good eight hours earlier than I could have hoped for. My day was looking up.</p><p>When we finally arrived back in Vegas we deplaned with efficient and single-minded purpose, still hoping to catch the flight to New York. \u201cJavier says it\u2019s D39, the gate next door. He\u2019s waiting there now. He\u2019s all checked in, and we\u2019re listed. We just need to get there in the next twenty minutes.\u201d</p><p>And we did, rushing off the plane at the first possible moment, barely saying goodbye to the rest of the crew. Stephan left his paperwork with Jake, who would drop it off for him.</p><p>Javier grinned when he saw us running up to the podium.</p><p>We got on the plane, if only barely. It departed not ten minutes after we got on board. I only had time to leave James a brief text telling him that we were on our way, and what time we would arrive. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Stephan and Javier fell soundly asleep in the back row of the plane, but I got up to help the main cabin crew with drinks since I was in uniform, the flight was nearly full, and the people were downright cranky with the delay. As though a sleep wand had been waved over the passengers, they all seemed to fall asleep right after they got their drinks. I was prying empty cups out of the hands of sleeping passengers when I caught the flight attendant I\u2019d been helping studying me with a strange intensity.</p><p>I\u2019d never met her before, but she\u2019d seemed friendly enough when she realized that I was going to help her with their service, no strings attached.</p><p>She was a very small, very nondescript woman in her early twenties. She was hispanic and had long black hair and eyes so dark they looked black.</p><p>We were back in the galley, just the two of us, when she seemed to get up the nerve to ask the question that was obviously on her mind.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re that flight attendant who\u2019s dating James Cavendish, aren\u2019t you?\u201d she asked. Her tone wasn\u2019t hostile, merely curious. In fact it was a little too curious for a complete stranger, something in her voice suggesting that she knew something about him, or even about me. I shouldn\u2019t have been so surprised by it, but it was the first time I had experienced that sort of strange interaction with a co-worker.</p><p>I sighed. \u201cYes, I\u2019m dating him,\u201d I finally said.</p><p>She didn\u2019t smile, just gave me that fascinated stare. It was unnerving. \u201cIt must not be serious. I\u2019m right, aren\u2019t I? You wouldn\u2019t still be working here if he were serious about you.\u201d</p><p>I felt myself getting instantly defensive about my job. \u201cI like my job. What\u2019s wrong with working here?\u201d</p><p>She gave me a stare that was way too direct for a stranger talking about my personal life. \u201cCome on.</p> <p>He must make more money than this just brushing his teeth in the morning. I\u2019m just saying that if he wanted to live with you or marry you or whatever, it would be beyond pointless for you to be spending all of your time making peanuts while he makes billions. If he was serious, he would let you quit.\u201d</p><p>I felt myself flush, but tried to maintain my composure. \u201cFor your information, we are living together, and I haven\u2019t quit because I like my job. So what if he makes more money than me? I still have to work.</p><p>I\u2019m not going to sit around all day and wait for him.\u201d I realized even as I made the argument that that would never be the case, whether I had this job or not.</p><p>I didn\u2019t need to worry about waiting around for him all the time because I just wouldn\u2019t do it. And he knew me well enough to know not to expect it from me, either. What would I do if I could do anything I wanted? I wondered, kind of stunned that I was even letting myself think that way.</p><p>I remembered that I was in the middle of a conversation with an obnoxious woman who seemed to think she knew something about my life. \u201cAnd why on earth do you assume that you know anything at all about either of us?\u201d</p><p>She had the nerve to give me a conspiratorial smile as she reached into her flight bag. She handed me a rolled up magazine. \u201cI\u2019ve been keeping up with all of the drama,\u201d she said, as though it were an accomplishment.</p> <p>I cringed as I saw the cover of the gossip mag she\u2019d handed me. It was a picture of me wearing a transparent white slip and standing in my driveway, looking stunned and confused. You could just make out the outline of my nipples in the thin slip. At least it wasn\u2019t obvious that I hadn\u2019t been wearing panties.</p><p>James was behind me in the shot, obviously striding towards me, but giving the man taking the shots a positively murderous look. He looked absolutely gorgeous wearing only his boxers, even his hair perfectly disheveled. My own hair looked like it had just been through a wind-tunnel.</p><p>When I was done working through my own feelings about the horrible pictures getting out, my mind went to James. He must know about it by now. He probably had people who brought it to his attention. If I was this upset, I knew he would be livid.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s so hot. Do you have any idea how hot he is?\u201d the strange flight attendant was asking me. I really needed to remember her name.</p><p>I gave her a very direct stare with lots of eye contact. \u201cAs a matter of fact, I know exactly how hot he is. Trust me when I say that you don\u2019t have any idea just how hot he is.\u201d</p><p>She made a motion as though she were swooning. \u201cThat is awesome,\u201d she said with a sigh, and I realized for the first time that, though she didn\u2019t have any manners at all, she meant no harm. In fact, she didn\u2019t seem to have a malicious bone in her body as she stared at James on the cover of the magazine.</p><p>\u201cGood for you, girl. He\u2019s a total dreamboat.\u201d</p><p>I threw her a bone, feeling tired but suddenly a little delirious about the fact that I might see James in just a few short hours, depending on if he was at work by the time we got there. \u201cThere\u2019s a chance he might be picking me up from the airport. If he is, it will probably be right by the crew van pickup, so you might get a glance at him.\u201d</p> <p>She grinned at me as though I had just done her a huge favor. \u201cThat\u2019s so awesome. He can\u2019t possibly be that beautiful in person, though, so I\u2019ll brace myself for disappointment.\u201d</p><p>I had to smile back. \u201cActually, he\u2019s even more gorgeous. Sometimes I call him Mr. Beautiful.\u201d</p><p>She giggled. \u201cYou\u2019re very pretty and all, but he can have any woman on the planet. No offense, but how did you manage to land him?\u201d</p><p>I gave her my little shrug, strangely no longer offended by her candor. \u201cI really have no idea.\u201d</p><p>Our strange little talk was interrupted as the two other members of the main cabin crew came through the curtain. They were less pushy, but both of them gave me strange, probing looks, and I figured they\u2019d heard or seen something about me.</p><p>I asked them politely if they needed any more help. When they declined, I ducked back into the cabin and found my seat beside Stephan. I lay my head back and tried my best to get a short nap in.</p><p>I awoke with a start as the plane touched down. I was so conditioned to stay awake on red-eyes that I was surprised I\u2019d been able to sleep that long on a plane.</p><p>I sent James a text as we taxied in.</p><p>Bianca: We just landed.</p><p>He responded immediately.</p><p>James: There\u2019s a car waiting at the curb for you.</p><p>That didn\u2019t seem to need a response, so I put my phone away, deplaning as quickly as possibly. We were in the last row of the aircraft, though, and it was a frustratingly slow process.</p><p>We wound up walking with the crew through the airport. Stephan grabbed my small flight bag from me without a word, as was his wont.</p><p>The strange girl, who was named Marie, as I discovered when she reintroduced herself, made her way to my side as we walked. She chatted on and on about celebrity gossip.</p><p>She seemed to think that because I was in the tabloids, I would also like reading them, and be caught up on the latest drama. She seemed crestfallen when I disabused her of the notion. I really had no idea who she was talking about.</p><p>She had me half-distracted with her endless chatter as we stepped out of the sliding door and began to make our way to the pickup spot at the curb. But I wasn\u2019t so distracted that I didn\u2019t instantly see the tall figure step out of the limo parked just behind the crew van. Even if he hadn\u2019t gotten out of the car, there was no way I could have missed Clark\u2019s imposing figure waiting on the sidewalk for us. But James stepping out of the car with the warmest smile on his face made me instantly forget that there were even other people in the world, let alone that one was babbling at me.</p><p>Without even thinking about it, my steps quickened until I was nearly running to him.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t indifferent to my enthusiasm. He began to walk briskly towards me, obviously determined to meet me at least halfway.</p><p>When we got within arm\u2019s reach of each other he grabbed me to him in a bone-jarring embrace, his hold painful but oh so comforting to me. I had thrown my arms around his neck at the same moment he\u2019d grabbed and I held on tightly as he lifted me, moving back towards his car, one hand cupping the back of my head firmly. I felt like I was five years old, my feet dangling inches from the ground. I nearly laughed.</p><p>\u201cJames, put me down,\u201d I sputtered.</p><p>He just gripped me tighter, moving purposefully towards the car. \u201cI can\u2019t be in public like this, Bianca.</p><p>I feel too raw. God, I missed you. It felt like Christmas when I heard you were getting in ahead of schedule.\u201d</p><p>I gripped his silky hair in my fists. \u201cI missed you, too. It\u2019s scary just how much. I don\u2019t know how it happened so fast, but you feel like home to me, James.\u201d</p><p>A hoarse, pained sound escaped his throat. \u201cYes,\u201d he said, his voice rough with emotion. \u201cThis is home.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER FORTY-ONE</p><p>James had me in the car and securely ensconced on his lap when Stephan and Javier finally joined us, both of them grinning widely. They had obviously found our over-enthusiastic reunion amusing.</p><p>\u201cI have to warn you guys; that crew is going to tell the world about that little scene. That small sassy one, Marie, was even making noises about giving an interview to the press,\u201d Stephan said, his voice more amused than worried.</p><p>I rolled my eyes. That little gossip-monger probably would, too. I tried to remember if I had told her anything I wouldn\u2019t want shared, but mentally shrugged the whole thing off. There was nothing I could do about any of it now, and it was much more pleasant to bask in the presence of Mr. Beautiful than to worry about what-ifs.</p><p>James greeted the other men politely before he began to nuzzle into my hair. I felt him breathing me in, and my eyes closed in pleasure.</p><p>His arms were wrapped around me snugly, but suddenly they tightened to the point of pain and I felt him tense.</p><p>\u201cI need to tell you something,\u201d he whispered, his mouth at my ear. From the tension in his body and voice, I immediately knew that something was terribly wrong.</p><p>I stiffened, turning to study his face. His strange change of mood was troubling, to say the least. And his eyes were haunted, just the sight of them making my chest tighten in dread.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSharon Karlsson was found dead in her home last night. She was murdered.\u201d His voice was quiet, but the car went deathly silent at his news.</p><p>I just froze, staring at him as I processed his words. I had been trying to call her, to tell her about my father, but I had failed to get ahold of her.</p><p>Could I have prevented this? Was I to blame?</p><p>It wasn\u2019t even a question to me who had killed her. It was just too big of a coincidence, and I had stared too fully into the murdering eyes of my father not to know that he was fully capable of killing again. It was only a wonder that he hadn\u2019t killed again before this. Though, for all I knew, he had.</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d I finally asked.</p><p>He ran a hand over my hair, a gesture that I thought was to comfort himself as much as me. \u201cShe was shot in the head.\u201d</p><p>I thought of the way my mother had died, a mock suicide where she\u2019d \u2018eaten the gun.\u2019 \u201cLike my mother?\u201d I asked, my voice very small.</p><p>His eyes were impossibly tender, and infinitely worried, on my own. \u201cYes, like that.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body>  <p>\u201cI tried to tell her. I\u2019ve been trying to call her since I found out she existed, but I feel responsible. He\u2019s a killer, and he stayed free because I lied for him. I don\u2019t know why, but I never imagined he\u2019d kill again. I\u2019ve known for all these years, and somehow it just never occurred to me. Why do you suppose that is? I should have thought of it.\u201d My voice was pitched low, but it seemed to crack through the stunned silence of the car.</p><p>Everyone began to speak at once.</p><p>\u201cYou are not responsible for this,\u201d James said, his voice firm and harsh and full of pain.</p><p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t have known, Buttercup,\u201d Stephan said, his voice passionately sincere.</p> <p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t do that to yourself,\u201d Javier implored quietly.</p><p>I ignored the reassurances, feeling the weight of her death like a heavy burden on my soul. And shamefully, even stronger than that guilt was the fear. My father had killed at least two women now, something he\u2019d threatened to do to me more times than I could count. Even with the numb state my brain seemed to be in with the disturbing news of Sharon\u2019s death, what I felt the most was a chilling terror that ran so deep I couldn\u2019t remember a time that it hadn\u2019t been a part of me.</p><p>I shared a long look with James. In his eyes I saw a wrenching helplessness that mirrored my own. </p>  </body></html>"]
