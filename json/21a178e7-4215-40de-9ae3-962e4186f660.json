Or a Road Runner cartoon? When my burglar parents named me John Doe so I\u2019d have an automatic alias? This is all their fault: yes.</p><p>It really did start out simply. Crime ran in his family, and marijuana is a gateway drug. How else to explain how he\u2019d gone from amiable, sleepy pot user to emaciated, stressed pseudo-ruthless cokehead dealer? It was once again trendy to blame the parents for everything from bleeding ulcers to a life of crime, but he never had a chance.</p> <p>Dad: \u201cThere\u2019s no point in trying to have a normal life. Rather than work hard and then throw it all away with reckless behavior, throw it all away while you\u2019re still young. It\u2019s the American dream!\u201d</p><p>Mom: \u201cAlso, we don\u2019t think you\u2019re smart enough for college.\u201d</p><p>High school guidance counselor: \u201cSmart\u2019s not the issue. You seem to have been genetically programmed for a life of crime. I wash my hands of you. And also any prospects I once had of making a name for myself in this field.\u201d</p><p>Okay, maybe going from occasional pot use to dealing coke was inevitable, but bullets flying past my nose? Sirens shrilling in the background? What is this, the \u201980s? How am I a cocaine dealer running from the St. Paul police? The only way this could get more terrible is if she shows up. He groaned silently, then began to wriggle farther around the corner for more cover. And me without my pastel blazer and artfully mussed hair. Oh, the humanity!</p><p>He sulked while he wormed his way to safety; as if all this wasn\u2019t bad enough, most of the building was under construction, which meant traffic had been a bitch. He\u2019d been told there was only one security guy at that hour, which was true. He was told the guard in question was a retired cop too pudgy and Minnesota-nice to pull his weapon, which was the opposite of true. He\u2019d barely crossed the threshold into the coffee shop when the guy reached.</p> <p>I just have that kind of face, he acknowledged in despair. His gaze was naturally shifty. He had a tendency to pull in his shoulders when talking, as if awaiting a bullet, which happened a lot. Everybody had bullets. He didn\u2019t walk, he scuttled. And, completing the genetic treason of his criminally minded family, he had beady eyes: small, dark, squinty. He had looked like he was up to something in the crib, for God\u2019s sake.</p><p>Still: it took brass ones to turn one\u2019s back on generations of family tradition. John Doe\u2019s were made of fool\u2019s gold, not brass. Ah, terrible analogy. Fool\u2019s gold? Maybe you should stop thinking about your balls and find an exit.</p><p>\u201cAh, very nice,\u201d someone said behind him.</p><p>John Doe flopped over on his back like a startled turtle. A turtle in the middle of committing several misdemeanors and at least two felonies. \u201cWhere\u2019d you come from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe coffee shop next door.\u201d The woman was looking down at him from a great height (at least to his perspective\u2014he was five foot three) with an odd expression. It took him a moment to figure it out, because he was expecting fear or shock to show in her eyes and on her face, and that wasn\u2019t happening. There were the crooks and there were the cops and there was everyone else. Everyone else either a) never noticed something was wrong, b) did notice and didn\u2019t care, or c) noticed and were scared. The ones who noticed and didn\u2019t care never engaged.</p><p>So he needed a few seconds to name the expression. Annoyed, he decided. Like nearly walking through a cross fire between an angry Minnesota-nice security guard and a convicted felon was going to inconvenience her. And let her coffee get cold; he saw she was holding a cardboard drink tray, with two steaming drinks in it. Yep: she didn\u2019t want her coffee to get cold.</p> <p>Well, he was sorry, but he was going to have to inconvenience her. It wasn\u2019t his fault. His parents had willfully named him John Doe. They never even apologized!</p><p>\u201cListen, I need a\u2014\u201d Meat shield? No; it wouldn\u2019t do to freak her out more than she (probably) was. \u201cA hostage. Just to get off the block.\u201d And out of the city. And then possibly the country. It was summer in Australia, right? He\u2019d always wanted to see the Sydney Opera House. \u201cI won\u2019t hurt you. Unless the cops make me kill you. Hurt you! If the cops make me hurt you. Is what I meant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are going to make me tardy, which I loathe.\u201d She sounded pissy, not afraid. Which was . . . good? Hysterical hostages made everything harder. And noisier. \u201cInconsiderate thieving asshole,\u201d she added.</p><p>Asshole?</p><p>She was striking\u2014perhaps that was throwing him off. Tall, as he\u2019d noted, with pale skin and small, close-set dark eyes. Not a blemish on her face, because the beauty mark hardly counted as a defect. Her hair was deep brown and a foil for the rest of her, like the color of the rich soil of a flower bed after it rained.</p><p>\u201cSo, you know.\u201d He climbed to his feet, one hand brushing his knees (the John Woo\u2013esque dive through the doorway had shredded his chinos, and why didn\u2019t they ever put that in the movies?) and the other on the piece-of-shit .38 his gram-gram had given him for his bar mitzvah. \u201cOh, I can\u2019t believe my wittle baby is all growed up! Give Grammy some yum-yum kisses and then we\u2019ll go shoot your gunny-gun!\u201d</p><p>Jeez, Gram, you couldn\u2019t give me one of your ex-husband\u2019s decent guns? I was thirteen! I deserved a Desert Eagle at the least!</p><p>\u201cSo, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve watched TV so you know the drill.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cStop now. Surrender. If your inept shenanigans do not make me much later, I\u2019ll try to refrain from beating you to death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry,\u201d she repeated in a voice so icy he actually shivered despite the rivers of sweat in his armpits. Then she added something that was stranger than this already-strange chat: \u201cYou haven\u2019t left me a note, have you?\u201d</p><p>So sad to run into a drunk, and at this time of the morning. Society is the Titanic after the iceberg.</p><p>He took a breath. \u201cListen, you\u2019re not in charge here. I\u2019m the one with the gunny-gun.\u201d Ah, hell. Even from the grave you humiliate me, Grammy. \u201cSo you just get over here and then we\u2019ll take a quick\u2014What are you doing?\u201d</p><p>She had popped the top of the first steaming drink with her thumb, upended the thing, and sucked it down in three monster swallows. He winced and rubbed his throat in unconscious sympathy. Then she did the same with the second drink.</p><p>\u201cHey, take it easy! Look, there\u2019s no need to give yourself third-degree throat burns just to avoid me taking . . . you . . . hostage . . . buh . . . nnnnhh?\u201d</p><p>Words failed him. Words had failed him because she was now eating the empty coffee cups\u2014yes, she was biting off pieces of cup and chewing and gulping them down, and now she was\u2014was she?\u2014yes! Now she was eating the cardboard drink holder. And washing it down with the handful of nails she must have picked up at the construction site. She was gulping them down\u2014three-inch nails!\u2014like they were gummy worms.</p><p>\u201cOh my God! It\u2019s you! You\u2019re\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo not,\u201d she warned with a mouthful of casing nails.</p><p>\u201c\u2014It Girl!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever say I didn\u2019t warn you,\u201d she said, and launched herself at him.</p><p>CHAPTER ONE</p><p>Get to It Already.</p><p>Hailey Derry seized the small garbage can and spat out a wad of chewed cardboard drink holder. Then she gathered up her work debris, struggled with her seat belt, then lurched out of the car. She scurried past a lawn so perfectly manicured it didn\u2019t look real, past the small flock of geese eating and pooping all over the perfectly maintained grass, up the wide sidewalk (so wide employees called it the cement moat), toward the looming HQ of her cross to bear, the bane of her existence, the bet with God she\u2019d lost before birth.</p><p>Must have lost. It was the only explanation for her life.</p><p>Ramouette, a company famous for 1) producing high-quality target silhouettes, and 2) the utter indifference of its CEO, who came to the office about five times a year, loomed over Savage\u2019s southern edge. Savage, Minnesota, was famous for its annual celebration honoring a dead horse, its proximity to RenFest, and the enormous amount of acid most of the population dropped. It was the only explanation, journalists all over the country had agreed, for all the superhero sightings.</p><p>That, or there really were superheroes. Not Batman-esque superheroes, whose power was being a wealthy Republican. Heroes with weird powers. And super villains, for where the former led, the latter followed, except when it was the other way around. So, all right, maybe it wasn\u2019t rampant drug use. There might be such things as superheroes. But it was Minnesota, for God\u2019s sake. Who cared?</p><p>Hailey wouldn\u2019t think about that right now. She was late (again) and irritated (again) and her cold chocolate was undrinkable (again), and she didn\u2019t want to be in this car in this parking lot in this town in this state. Again.</p><p>I\u2019m out of the car. Now I need to get into the building. Get to work. You are not a victim. You chose to interfere this morning and you chose to take this job and you chose to be here.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she muttered. How did one talk back to inner voices? It seemed counterproductive. Also, her inner voice sounded exactly like her mother, which was so horrifying it didn\u2019t bear thinking about.</p><p>She would think about her awful job instead. She would ponder that her reactions to the forces in her life tended toward the clich\u00e9d: the movie Office Space was her Mein Kampf, without all the genocide. Or prison POV. Or megalomania. Yes, yes, anyone who had ever been ensconced in a cubicle, while fluorescent lighting beat down on them, thought Office Space was the story of their life. But in her case, it was.</p><p>Hailey, too, was forced to do meaningless busywork by someone she didn\u2019t respect. She, too, was forced to fill out paperwork that had no purpose other than to make simple tasks harder. She, too, often dreamed of committing arson on such a huge scale Savage would still be smoldering fifty years later. And Hailey, too, had a boss she disliked so much it nearly made her sick to look at the worthless cow. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She was the boss. The head of Human Resources; she only answered to one other person, and Ann Denison hated her job more than she did.</p><p>Initially dismissing that as impossible, Hailey gradually came to realize that, yes, indeed, Ann hated running the company more than Hailey hated exit interviews. In her quest to pursue Olympic recognition for her treasured sport, broomball, the CEO had priorities other than overseeing Ramouette\u2019s production of iron silhouettes designed for the purpose of people shooting them to knock them over, after which they would be picked up and repositioned and shot at more and more and more.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t find that fulfilling?\u201d she\u2019d asked during her interview.</p><p>\u201cShush,\u201d Ann had replied, poring over the broomball world rankings. \u201cI\u2019m in crisis mode here. I\u2019ve got a serious problem here. Minnesota only made the top seventy-five twenty-two times.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUpsetting?\u201d she guessed.</p><p>\u201cWe should be on it seventy-five times!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd for sure, first. I mean, come on. That\u2019s so obvious it hurts. But not even the top five? Someone\u2019s gotten to these guys.\u201d She slammed a small fist on her desk, making the broomball trophies tremble. Most people put family photos on their desks, and occasionally computers. Not this one; the space not occupied by trophies was taken up by the broomball rule book and grip tape. \u201cThe corruption starts at the bottom and oozes its way through all the layers of the broomball rankings! And they think I\u2019m just gonna sit here? Sit here and let them barf all over all that\u2019s good and holy about broomball? My big white Scandinavian butt, I will!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Hailey stood. \u201cI had no idea you were clinically insane. I\u2019ll leave you to . . . that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, you can\u2019t go!\u201d Ann had said, crumpling the magazine in her agitation. \u201cYou have to stay and run HR and, you know, hire people and things so we have people to make stuff and then we have stuff for customers to buy so they give us money and I use that money to get broomball recognized as an Olympic sport, and to practice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was the most succinct mission statement I have ever heard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do what I want you to do. I hate that stuff. But my dad\u2019s retiring and a bunch of people left with him, so there\u2019s all these slots to fill and I just can\u2019t, Hailey. Also . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to root out the insidious corruption hidden in the national broomball rankings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d she\u2019d screamed, and then crawled across her desk and hugged her. Hailey was so startled and amused she didn\u2019t toss her new boss through the window behind them.</p><p>So she\u2019d taken the job. To this day, she had no idea why. Well, she knew, way down at the bottom of her brain, where it was dark all the time. But the top of her brain pretended she had no clue.</p> <p>So here she was, late again. She was supposed to be running a new hire through the worthless maze that was corporate life at Ramouette. One of her minions\u2014their word, not hers, and it had amused her enough that she let it stand, so now there were in-house minion meetings and underling training seminars and Wretch 101\u2014anyway, one of them had interviewed what\u2019s-his-name, had been authorized to make an offer of a salary large enough to keep him coming back day after nightmarish day but not enough to pull together savings and eventually depart to a better life. And the poor wretch had accepted.</p><p>She raced past reception, hearing the soft drone of Audrey\u2019s near-constant, \u201cThank you for calling Ramouette, how kinnI direct yer call, then?\u201d like some would listen to Zen chants. She\u2019d only lived in Minnesota four years, but she loved the mild local accent. Someone could be in the middle of a murder, but when they piped up with a cheery, \u201cOooookay, then, I\u2019m gonna shoot this here guy in the face and dismember him and then play with his body in a ritual-type deal, and then I\u2019ll just haveta kill you, too, then,\u201d it was hard not to smile. (She knew this for a fact. The most depraved serial killer sounded downright adorable when they drew out their os.)</p><p>Past reception, she took a left by the restrooms, caught an empty elevator (yes!) to third, another left down a dull windowless hallway carpeted in Corporate Buff, and then was walking through the small HR department toward her office in the back. It had, of course, a real window that opened. A window large enough to accommodate her occasional leaps to the perfect turf below.</p><p>\u201cHi, I\u2019m Hailey Derry, sorry to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHero. Hero.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She nearly dropped her laptop. Her eight o\u2019clock had gotten to his feet the moment he saw her. The way he\u2019d greeted her\u2014unless she had misheard, and she must have misheard\u2014was not the only interesting thing about him. He had the oddest coloring she had ever seen. \u201cYou\u2014what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHero. That\u2019s you.\u201d</p><p>She stared, and then, trying a different tack, stared more. He was close to her in height, maybe an inch taller at five-eleven or so, with a rude shock of bright red hair. Not a pretty auburn or a masculine deep mahogany: it was red red, Irish red, and he had a face full of light freckles to go with it, and a wide mouth that looked like it was full of smiles and perhaps kisses. A conservative blue shirt and blue \u2013 and red-striped tie, khakis, and dark loafers that looked comfortable as well as practical.</p> <p>For whatever reason, her mind seized on his outfit. \u201cEvery day at Ramouette is casual day!\u201d one of their more insipid HR slogans trumpeted. \u201cExcept when it comes to customer service, of course!\u201d</p><p>But his eyes. Never mind his clothes, or the freckles, or the mouth she hoped was full of kisses. \u201cYour eyes,\u201d she said, and then couldn\u2019t believe she\u2019d said it out loud.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He laughed and rubbed the back of his neck. \u201cMy mom\u2019s Irish. My dad\u2019s from Lucknow, in India. So I\u2019m kind of . . .\u201d</p><p>Dazzling.</p><p>\u201c. . . a mix.\u201d</p><p>His hair and mouth and freckles made him look sweet, like a boyfriend you could snuggle and nag and bang as well as\u2014as\u2014what was the phrase? Pal around with? Yes: he looked like the sort of boyfriend who could also be your friend. But her new coworker\u2019s eyes, soulful and large and dark, his eyes made him seem mysterious, like a lover you adored but sometimes wondered about. When he\u2019s touching me in the dark and I\u2019m groaning his name, what is he really thinking?</p><p>Like that.</p><p>Exactly like that.</p><p>Now he was staring, and she realized she hadn\u2019t commented. So she hurried to do so: \u201cYes. Mix. Yes. You are a mix. That is what you are. You are a mixture of . . . of them. The parents. Your parents, is what I mean.\u201d</p><p>He blinked but, thank all the gods, let it go. \u201cYeah, so we\u2019ve established that. Anyway, that\u2019s what your name means. Hero. I\u2019m Jamie Linus, by the way, and, yep, I\u2019ve heard all the jokes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe jokes. Heard \u2019em all. That\u2019s not a dare to think up different things to say about my dumb name, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour dumb name?\u201d</p><p>Hailey, you dim dolt, will you get ahold of yourself right now?</p><p>She did. She always obeyed that voice, no matter how much trouble it got her in. Stop that robbery. Fire that idiot. Hire that single mother. Get ahold of yourself right now. It was her mother\u2019s voice, but she didn\u2019t mind. Since her mother died four years ago, this was as close as she could come to hearing her. I tuned her out most of my life, she thought, morbidly aware of the irony, and only listened after she died.</p><p>\u201cMy office, please.\u201d She gestured for him to go in, but he courteously stepped back to let her go first. \u201cI must apologize. It was a . . . a chaotic morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I heard,\u201d he said cheerfully. \u201cIt Girl foiled a robbery! Or something. I dunno. But she was right downtown! I only missed her by, what? Ten, fifteen minutes? Argh. Man, that must have been awesome.\u201d</p><p>Ah. That did it. She had no trouble focusing now. Just hearing his pleasant baritone say the hated name was enough to snap her back into her despised job, loveless life, and Pop-Tart-less desk drawer.</p><p>Thank goodness. Because really . . . what else was there?</p><p>CHAPTER TWO</p><p>What Are You Waiting For?</p><p>\u201cMy dad was a reporter,\u201d Linus was saying, \u201cand my mom was\u2014is\u2014a teacher. Still is, I mean. And what with one thing and another, they got started on this project\u2014finding the roots of names, figuring out what they mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmmm. You may have skipped a step in your story.\u201d If she wasn\u2019t looking at him, things were easier. So she was shuffling the paper on her desk like it was a deck of cards made up of eight-and-a-half-by-eleven-inch printer paper. \u201cYes. I hear you.\u201d</p><p>Whatever he said next she missed; she\u2019d found another note. Not hidden or anything. A yellow Post-it, right on top of her closed laptop: WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?</p><p>Dammit! Had she missed another budget meeting? Or was it about something worse, something secret? These cryptic notes were getting ever more . . . well . . . cryptic. If someone had a problem with her, they should just come right out and say\u2014</p><p>\u201cThat explains the curse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, you were listening!\u201d He beamed, so pleased she had to smile. \u201cLots of people don\u2019t. Who can blame them? Roots of names, for God\u2019s sake. Pass the snores, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh . . . right.\u201d She pulled the note; crumpled it in her fist. Tossed it. Sat behind her desk. \u201cYou spoke of a curse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. They were definitely cursed,\u201d he went on. \u201cThe root of our surname means teacher.\u201d He paused. \u201cA kind of teacher, anyway, but that\u2019s another whole thing to get into . . . Anyway, my mom loved it and figured they\u2019d live up to it. So they wrote a bunch of those baby name books.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes?\u201d Interesting. She supposed someone had to sit down and write those baby name books. It never occurred to her she would know someone who knew someone who did. \u201cYour folks must have given a lot of thought to your name, then.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNope. They got so they were sick of digging for hidden meanings in everything. Just . . . so . . . sick of it, y\u2019know? Do we want to give him a name that means hero or teacher or blessed one or pain in the ass or weird child with obsessive tendencies . . . ?\u201d</p><p>She burst out laughing, and he laughed with her. \u201cExactly . . . ugh, right? My folks . . . they just wanted names to be names again. We got a new dog just before I went to college.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI fear to ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpot.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally jaded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess so. So if Linus means teacher\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s supposed to mean it, but I think that might be off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow come?\u201d</p> <p>He shifted uncomfortably. \u201cWell, Linus was the guy who taught music to Hercules.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil Hercules killed him with his own lyre.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLinus equals sucker,\u201d he finished.</p><p>\u201cWhat . . . what\u2019s your first name again?\u201d she asked, dying and dreading to hear it at the same time.</p> <p>\u201cJamie. Which is several pokes in the eye, how\u2019s that for annoying?\u201d But he didn\u2019t sound annoyed. He sounded almost aggravatingly cheerful. Being around him simultaneously cheered and exhausted her. \u201cIt\u2019s unisex, so people have to meet me to know if I\u2019m a woman with a weird last name or a man with a weird last name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see how that would be inconvenient.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the root meaning! Supplanter . . . what, like Henry VII? Like an invading tyrant? Or a claim jumper out of the Little House books? Or a low-level parasite, like dandelions? Yuck. Besides, everybody calls me Linus. People have given me soooo . . . many . . . Linus birthday cards and gift wrap and small Linus statues and blankets. I\u2019m a grown man, for God\u2019s sake, and people still give me blue blankies for Christmas.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s easier if you don\u2019t look at him. Because something was wrong with her. She should have found this odd conversation dull, or at least irritating, especially since she was late, would therefore be behind all day, and had to write herself up again for tardiness. Instead, she wanted to keep asking him about names. Perhaps the flu? It\u2019s supposed to be bad this year. Of course, they say that every year. And I can\u2019t get sick. Physically, that is. She could get sick of crime. She could get sick of writing herself up. But she couldn\u2019t get the flu, or a cold, or an STD.</p><p>\u201cWhat . . . ah . . .\u201d It was probably on one or more of the pieces of paper in his file, but she couldn\u2019t find it. \u201cWhat do you do here again?\u201d</p><p>He arched his eyebrows in surprise and she could almost read his mind: You\u2019re in HR and you don\u2019t know that? \u201cAccounting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Hmm. He didn\u2019t seem the type. Far too personable. And gorgeous. And gorgeous. And . . . er . . . what were they talking about again? She should try to hold up her end of the conversation.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, you wanted to meet.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI did?\u201d</p><p>He blinked slowly, like an owl. It only emphasized his deep dark eyes. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>She had no idea why.</p><p>\u201cI am a new hire,\u201d he said slowly, taking in her confused expression. \u201cYou work for Human Resources for the company that has made me a new hire. Ergo, we have some . . . I dunno . . . paperwork at the very least, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight!\u201d She had it now. \u201cI am in HR! And you are a new hire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee?\u201d He smiled. It was devastating. There wasn\u2019t a sexier grin anywhere. Ever. In the history of grins. In the history of teeth! Oh, I might be in real trouble here . . . \u201cWe\u2019re in agreement already. I love when coworkers get along.\u201d</p><p>That, she knew, would change. Her rep as resident Hypocritical Bitch would soon reach him. He would dismiss her as napalm in a knockoff suit and avoid her at all costs, which, of course, was all according to plan.</p><p>Dammit!</p><p>\u201cYou have to go away now,\u201d she told him. \u201cI have to find the rest of your paperwork.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d He slouched to his feet. She had no idea how he did that. He was all relaxed and boneless and then he sort of lurched and then he was standing in front of her. He extended a hand and, dazed, she shook it. His hand was warm and dry; his grip was firm. And his eyes . . . \u201cWell, nice to meet you and all. I think I\u2019ll go find the bathrooms. And maybe a machine stuffed with greasy food that would kill me if I ate it in huge quantities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice,\u201d she said soberly, \u201cthat you have a to-do list.\u201d It was a pale joke, but when he smiled, she felt ridiculously pleased with herself.</p><p>Dammit!</p><p>CHAPTER THREE</p><p>Linus had been a member of the Ramouette family a week, and liked it.</p><p>He liked the commute; since he lived in Burnsville, one town over, it was less than forty minutes. He liked the company property: all that gorgeous green grass, nibbled all day by sleek Canadian geese, and then a vast cement moat swallowed the grass and went right up to the building.</p><p>He liked that Valleyfair, the local amusement park, was less than two miles from the office. On his second day, he found a little park\u2014not a real one, a secret park. There was a bench, but it was old and the paint had long faded. There was a duck pond, but the area around it hadn\u2019t been landscaped in years, and the ducks weren\u2019t fat white domesticated ones, but lean mallards who treated the place strictly as a rest stop. And there were so many weeping willow trees around it, the pond and the bench couldn\u2019t be seen from any of the nearby roads. A guy could grab a lunch and walk through the weeping willow branches and plop down on an old bench and enjoy a sandwich. He could watch the ducks and hear the clack-clack-clack of climbing cars, followed by shrieks of delight and, if the wind was right, occasional retching.</p><p>He liked the company\u2019s on-site fitness center, which put the local Bally\u2019s to shame: free Muscle Milk! And so many Stairmasters, stationery bikes, and treadmills there was never a line.</p><p>He liked the IT department, which was a first. At Ramouette, the IT guys kept to themselves, and their help desk guys were actually helpful. Their boss, Edward something or other, was a weird one, but again: it was IT, and was to be expected, the way you expected dogs to bark and cats to climb trees. When Edward wasn\u2019t lurking in the shadows, or holed up with the company server, he didn\u2019t bother anyone: yet another plus.</p><p>Linus also liked the paid holidays. All twenty-nine of them. When he\u2019d asked why there were so many (\u201cNot that I\u2019m looking a gift Arbor Day in the mouth.\u201d), he was told the company\u2019s owner hated being there so much, she felt sorry for those who didn\u2019t have their own company and so had to come to work, and encouraged Hailey to come up with as many holidays as she could.</p><p>Which was why Ramouette observed Christmas Day, Boxing Day, Vernal Equinox Day, New Year\u2019s Day, Arbor Day, Easter, Good Friday, Greenery Day, Black Monday, Clean Monday, Maundy Thursday, Valentine\u2019s Day, May Day, Independence Day, Pioneer Day, Dan Patch Day, Labor Day, National Freedom Day, Columbus Day, Turkmen Melon Day, Memorial Day, Halloween, Unity Day, Groundhog Day, Lammas Day, Veterans Day, Presidents Day, Martin Luther King Day, and Thanksgiving.*</p><p>All those in addition to three weeks of paid vacation, up to three weeks unpaid (as long as your work was getting done), and thirty days of sick time. All of which could be stockpiled if you didn\u2019t use them by year-end. One of the gals in marketing had been on vacation since July 1, 2010.</p><p>(\u201cNot surprised about all that sick time,\u201d Audrey the Receptionist confided while they jogged on side-by-side treadmills at 6:30 A.M. \u201cNobody was. Hailey\u2019s sick a lot. And she makes the rules, so . . .\u201d)</p><p>He liked the paternity leave . . . thirty days before the baby was born, sixty days after. Paid. The moms got thirty before, ninety after. Also paid. Linus was in his midtwenties and hadn\u2019t thought much about having kids. He wasn\u2019t old fashioned but wanted, if not a wife first, at least a steady girlfriend . . . no, okay, a wife. A wife to have kids with; he was old fashioned.</p><p>Anyway, kids were way off in the future, but even to a single guy, Ramouette\u2019s parental leave policy was impressive. Might be worth staying here for the next few years. Because if he ever did want kids, Hailey was so smart and so pretty and seemed really, really different and . . . and . . .</p><p>Anyway. He liked the pop machines, because Hailey had done something with\u2014or to\u2014the pop vendor, and thus, a big, tall cold fizzy drink cost twenty-five cents. In the twenty-first century!</p><p>And speak of the devil\u2014that was the impression he got from others, anyway\u2014he liked Hailey.</p><p>A lot.</p><p>Which was strange, because he\u2019d barely spoken with her once they finished his new-hire paperwork. She was in and out of the office a lot; the owner obviously kept her pretty busy.</p><p>Stranger: he seemed to be the only one who did like Hailey. Which was a puzzle to him, because she seemed pretty good at her job and cared about getting the best bennies she could for her fellow employees. Exhibit A: a big bottle of Coke for two bits. Exhibit B: you could stockpile a thousand vacation days and take them all at once. Exhibit C: Dan Patch Day.</p><p>He was thinking this while he loitered by the watercooler, talking to The Old Coot.</p><p>The Old Coot was his boss, the head of the accounting department. Like the accountants at his last job, they were weird. Every accountant he had ever met took pride in the fact that accountants had a rep for being dull, dry, numbers-obsessed dweebs, and then took pride in smashing that rep to shit.</p><p>None of that was why he was lingering by the watercooler. He knew the department heads had a meeting in five minutes, an important one about next year\u2019s marketing budget, so he knew Hailey would be there. Accounting lost the coin toss and had to host this week\u2019s meeting.</p><p>\u201cBruegger\u2019s again,\u201d The Old Coot was saying. \u201cWhen HR hosted last month, we got sushi! These guys have no imagination. In the old days . . .\u201d</p><p>Stifled groans from the cubicles around them. Linus never lost sight of the fact that though you might think you were in a private conversation with one person, at any given time at least a dozen people you couldn\u2019t see could hear it all. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIn the old days,\u201d The Old Coot continued, raising his voice to be heard over the groans, \u201cwe\u2019d plug in the Crock-Pot in the morning and have hot bubbly chili by lunchtime. Rolls from the bakery, cheese to sprinkle on your chili, all the twenty-five-cent pop you could drink . . . a proper lunch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFollowed by department heads farting and belching the rest of the day,\u201d an unseen voice said from one of the cubicles on the left.</p><p>\u201cDisaster,\u201d another unseen voice added from the right. \u201cHave you ever tried to proof a P and L statement when all you can smell are chili farts? Hell. Hell on earth.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI like bagels,\u201d Linus said, which was true. Also, The Old Coot seemed to be waiting for him to contribute to the conversation. \u201cAnd I can\u2019t believe there\u2019s actually a thing called a watercooler, around which employees can gather and make pop culture references, as we appear to be doing right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFree water,\u201d the first unseen voice said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Hailey put \u2019em in, so we all just bring our empty water bottles from home and fill \u2019em here at the cooler.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother fabbo perk brought to the good people of Ramouette by HR goddess Hailey Derry.\u201d Linus made the comment with total admiration.</p><p>\u201cHa!\u201d Unseen Voice Number Two said. \u201cGoddess, right. Says the newest minion, who hasn\u2019t been here long enough to really be terrified of her. Your time\u2019s coming, l\u2019il minion.\u201d</p> <p>He thought about letting it go, but couldn\u2019t. It seemed at best unfair, and at worst, ungrateful. \u201cYou guys, what\u2019s the problem? She\u2019s pulled all these great bennies for us, she\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t get her ass to work on time to save her life\u2014\u201d</p><p>The disembodied voice from the right broke in. \u201cShe can\u2019t go more than three weeks without pulling a sick day\u2014come on. Anyone who gets sick that often should live in a plastic bubble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaaaaaperwork!\u201d another unseen voice contributed. Linus had the impression of swimming in deep dark water, knowing there were sharks but not knowing how many . . . or how hungry they were. \u201cThat girl loves her paperwork.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe sends out memos reminding all of us to complete our shifts while she gets here late and leaves early . . . adds new codes to time sheets practically every week . . . nauseating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn my day,\u201d The Old Coot began, and ignored the groans, \u201cmemos were on paper. Real paper! From a tree and everything. And we had to fill out real paper timesheets. In ink!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThank God those dark days are behind us,\u201d Linus said with a shudder.</p><p>\u201cYou kids are soft.\u201d The Old Coot leaned forward and scooped a paper cup out of the dispenser, then carefully filled it with water and drank it down, his glug-glugs not quite as loud as the watercooler\u2019s. \u201cYou\u2019re the soft-boiled eggs of the breakfast world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, not this again.\u201d</p><p>Linus turned, delighted: it was Hailey! He could practically hear mouths snapping shut behind cubicles all over the room. Wonder if she overheard? \u201cHey.\u201d Wow, smooooth. You\u2019ll have her swept off her feet in no time.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cHey. What\u2019s wrong, Coot, are you reminiscing about PalmPilots again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow those kept a person on schedule. And speaking of schedules, what the hell are you doing here? Prepared for a budget meeting? And on time\u2014no, early.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter keep watch for the other horsemen of the Apocalypse,\u201d she said dryly.</p><p>Linus laughed as Coot rolled his eyes, but was well aware he could be contributing to the conversation, and wasn\u2019t. Say something!</p> <p>(Nope. He had nothin\u2019.)</p><p>Say anything!</p><p>He gulped a breath and managed, \u201cApocalypse was actually a girl\u2019s name thousands of years ago. It didn\u2019t always mean the end of everything. It meant revelation . . . uncovering truth and finding out what\u2019s really going on. It was\u201d\u2014he knew they were staring and gamely finished\u2014\u201cit was a good thing. A good name,\u201d he finished. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t weird to have a girl in the family named Apocalypse.\u201d</p><p>Okay, say something that isn\u2019t the thing you just said.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d Hailey teased. \u201cTrying to restart a baby name trend?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, relieved she didn\u2019t think what he\u2019d said was off-putting. Or if she did, she didn\u2019t seem to mind.</p><p>\u201cOhhhh, great,\u201d The Old Coot muttered. \u201cNew guy\u2019s as big a weirdo as Derry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a nasty thing to say,\u201d Hailey replied mildly, if absently. She was staring down at a yellow Post-it note. She must leave herself notes . . . She\u2019s always walking around with one of those.</p><p>Her hair was lightening toward strawberry blond, something else that was odd that the people around them didn\u2019t notice or, if they did, didn\u2019t think was interesting. When they\u2019d met earlier, her hair was dark brown. It set off her pale skin, and made her face seem more striking: wide creamy forehead, straight nose, and lush mouth. No freckles, but a beauty mark riding just above her upper lip; he spent an alarming amount of time thinking about kissing it.</p><p>But in a week, her dark locks had lightened to reddish blond. Why anyone would dye their hair a slightly lighter shade every single night was a mystery to him, as beautiful women and their secret tribal rituals always were.</p><p>\u201cJeez, Hailey, you even remembered your laptop. We didn\u2019t used to lug entire computers into meetings, y\u2019know. Hell, computers didn\u2019t used to be portable! Desktop computers . . . give me a break.\u201d</p><p>Another chorus of groans by unseen listeners, but The Old Coot was practiced in ignoring them.</p><p>\u201cHey, you know what we had before desktops? Actual desk tops. Tops of desks. And blotters. Blotters will make a comeback. I guarantee it. What\u2019s old is new, and all that.\u201d</p><p>Linus was wondering if he dared ask Hailey out right there, or if it would be better to try to catch her after the meeting, or maybe meet up with her on her way out the\u2014</p><p>\u201cOh my God!\u201d Another hidden voice, this one coming from the kitchen, which was two doors down from the watercooler. Before he could wonder about it, The Old Coot was saying, \u201cIt\u2019s good you can make this meeting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d She shrugged, took one last look at the Post-it, then crumpled it. \u201cI\u2019m right here; let\u2019s get started.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, great. Because with the new rollout next year, marketing\u2019s gonna be all over us, and we\u2019ve got to find a place in the budget\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMighty crap, people! Have you heard?\u201d Audrey the Receptionist bounded out of the break room like a puppy with earbuds. A puppy checking out her iPhone and eating a Hot Pocket. \u201cSome dumbass plowed into a garbage truck, the truck overcorrected and hit a bus, and now the bus is, like, surrounded by toxic waste or something!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeez,\u201d he said, shocked.</p><p>\u201cI know. It\u2019s going to utterly screw my commute.\u201d Audrey took another look at the small screen and shook her head, disgusted. \u201cI\u2019ve gotta take the 494 ramp not even a mile from there. Why can\u2019t more parents drive their kids to school? We wouldn\u2019t even need buses if they\u2019d step up.\u201d</p><p>Hailey turned back to The Old Coot. \u201cYou tell marketing that I loathe them with everything I have, do not care how many ads they want to run for the rollout, and will not set foot in that meeting until that entire department agrees to stop sucking.\u201d Then she whirled and stalked off.</p><p>\u201cWhoa,\u201d Linus said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, she really hates the marketing guys.\u201d Coot shrugged. \u201cI dunno; what\u2019s it to her? She\u2019s always picking a fight and then doing her ice cube impersonation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnock it off.\u201d Linus was startled at how sharply that came out, and consciously softened his tone. \u201cShe\u2019s got a tough job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf she was ever on time, it\u2019d be an easier job.\u201d</p><p>He opened his mouth to argue, but was still reeling from a) the odd conversation, b) the abruptness of Hailey\u2019s mood shift from friendly and pleasant to pissed and abrupt, and c) the fact that The Old Coot didn\u2019t look a day over thirty.</p><p>(\u201cWhy is that?\u201d he asked Audrey the Receptionist the night before.</p><p>\u201cBecause thirty is ancient in twenty-first-century tech years,\u201d she explained. \u201cThirty is the new ninety.\u201d)</p><p>\u201cWhat just happened?\u201d he asked aloud, and no one answered.</p><p>CHAPTER FOUR</p><p>Toldja: If You Don\u2019t Act, We Will.</p><p>Hailey limped back to the office. Shoving the bus to safety had ruined her clothes: torn pantyhose, scuffed shoes, torn skirt, torn blouse. Grease all over her hands. The heel of her left shoe wobbling at every staggered step. Left bra strap broken and dangling. Hair looking like she\u2019d combed it with a wire whisk. And unbelievable dry mouth.</p><p>And so, so hungry. Not to mention late for a budget meeting that likely ended over an hour ago. She hadn\u2019t even finished writing herself up for being late this morning, and now this.</p><p>Audrey the Receptionist greeted her with a, \u201cWhoa! And hey\u2014before I forget, Edward was looking for you. Something about his PO request for more internal fans for the server.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right . . . I\u2019ll call him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you pick another fight with the Chipotle guy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She limped past.</p><p>\u201cThe Subway guy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Now she was hurrying as fast as she could without breaking into a jog.</p><p>\u201cThe KFC guy? The bookstore gal? The Caribou Coffee guy? The Dunn Bros gal? The car wash guy? The bakery gal?\u201d Audrey was on her feet, hollering after her. \u201cThe gas station guy? Wait, the car wash guy and the gas guy are the same guy . . .\u201d</p><p>She was in such a rush she didn\u2019t realize she\u2019d knocked Linus over until she . . . well . . . knocked him over.</p><p>\u201cOw!\u201d He was gasping on the carpet, rubbing his nose. \u201cJeez, you\u2019re really bony.\u201d</p><p>Stupid, stupid, she inwardly raged. You haven\u2019t completely drained the batteries; you could have put him through the wall! Mortified, she bent to give him a hand up; he was back on his feet in less than a blink, which made him stagger against her. Given the state of her clothes, that should have been embarrassing, but wasn\u2019t. More thrilling than embarrassing, truth be told. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAagghh!

Are you hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. \u2019Course not.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThank God, okay, listen\u2014I\u2019m running late\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. The meeting\u2019s been over for\u2014\u201d</p><p>She groaned. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me.\u201d He was following her to her office, and for once, she didn\u2019t mind someone dogging her steps. \u201cCan\u2019t believe I missed another one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened? Did someone\u2014Are you\u2014Did somebody do this to you? Did someone try to . . . ?\u201d He took a breath. \u201cDid you have to fight someone off? Because if you did, we need to call the cops. Right now.\u201d</p><p>She was surprised to see him go from concerned to horrified anger, and so quickly. Then she realized what he thought might have happened. \u201cNo, no. I did it to myself.\u201d At least that doesn\u2019t sound exceptionally crazy. \u201cFlat tire.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh. I\u2019ve heard you get those a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s why I no longer buy American.\u201d She got to her office, kicked off her shoes, and sat down at her laptop. At least there wasn\u2019t a new note.</p><p>And that meant something. That was important. But she was so tired and hungry she couldn\u2019t put it together, couldn\u2019t put her finger on just why it was important, and resolved to think about it later.</p><p>Paperwork. She had to focus on something else. Had to. \u201cLinus, I have to write myself up\u2014sorry again about knocking you down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Hmmm. I assumed he would be quicker. \u201cBecause it was a rotten, rude thing to do.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, why do you have to write yourself up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in HR,\u201d she replied, confused.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo pay my rent?\u201d Was it a riddle? A game? What?</p><p>\u201cBut why here?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, tried to run her fingers through her hair, and gave up after finding a knot of tangles. Probably oil in it; wonderful. Had to gulp down the spilled oil and eat all the broken glass before I could move the bus. Broken glass tastes almost as bad as Corn Nuts do. \u201cLinus, I\u2019m not following you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really interesting, you know that?\u201d He\u2019d taken the chair opposite her desk. She knew she should show him the door but couldn\u2019t make herself say the words, much less move. He seemed so . . . so kind and nice and honestly interested. She had liked the way he looked at her during their interview a few days back, and she liked how he was looking at her now, when she was such a walking disaster, when she likely couldn\u2019t look worse. It was confusing and wonderful.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not interesting. I\u2019m very, very dull.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDull. Uh-huh. It\u2019s the worst-kept secret here that you hate your job. Except you\u2019re really good at your job and you go out of your way to get everything you can for us. You put in lots of extra effort for a job you say you hate, to help people you pretend you don\u2019t like. And it\u2019s possible\u2014don\u2019t take this the wrong way\u2014but I think the people here pretend not to like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you hate exercise, but you\u2019re always showing up panting and sweaty from jogging or whatever it is you do when you\u2019re not not going to budget meetings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOuch,\u201d she said, hurt.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean it in a nasty way,\u201d he quickly assured her. \u201cJust as another point of evidence that puts you in the interesting category. You give off this stiff vibe, but you\u2019re sometimes really friendly and nice. And then there\u2019s the . . .\u201d Too late, he realized where that last point was going.</p><p>Unfortunately, Hailey did, too, and gave him a wry smile. \u201cYes, continue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh . . . well, you\u2019ve got all these minions and underlings and Igors, and they pretend those are mean secret nicknames, but not only do you know about them, the impression I get is that you sort of like them.\u201d</p><p>I do like them. She did. Nicknames could be wonderful. Like a secret code only a few people knew. A family thing. A friend thing. And since she no longer had a family, and had never had friends, she loved the nicknames, nasty as they were. But she\u2019d done a poor job of hiding it, which made her worry: What else had she made a poor job of hiding?</p><p>He\u2019s known me a week. I knew he was sharp, but this is . . . this is something more than sharp.</p><p>And the notes.</p><p>Hmmm.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, you\u2019re interesting.\u201d He leaned back in his chair, started to put his feet up, checked himself, and slumped back in his seat.</p><p>She laughed. \u201cGo ahead. I don\u2019t have the moral high ground today when it comes to inappropriate employee behavior. Besides, I\u2019m not your boss\u2014just the person who hired you for your boss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Thanks.\u201d He stretched out long legs and crossed his feet at the ankles, inches away from paperwork. \u201cYou\u2019re not my boss, but there\u2019s something . . . Okay, one thing at a time. So like I said, if you hate it but not really, why are you even writing yourself up? Why do any of this\u201d\u2014he gestured to the room\u2014\u201cif you hate it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d She didn\u2019t. It was one thing to know that she could do a half-assed job, could come into the office no more than eight or ten hours a week, and Ann Denison would never fire her. In fact, Ann lived in fear of Hailey quitting.</p><p>Knowing that was one thing; taking rude advantage of it was something else. If she didn\u2019t write herself up for her frequent tardiness, no one would. No one would even say anything . . . not officially, and even if they would, Ann wouldn\u2019t care. And that made her think of the notes again. \u201cI guess . . . how can I hold everyone to standards I won\u2019t maintain myself? It\u2019s not fair, which I agree is a juvenile concept, but I don\u2019t have the stomach for it. I guess I\u2019m a terrible rebel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTerrible,\u201d he murmured, \u201cis not the first word I think of when your name comes up. And it comes up. A lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I imagine so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I ask you something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething else, you mean?\u201d She was pulling paperwork out of desk drawers and hunting pens. She could at least sign off on payroll today, even if nothing else got done.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Uh . . . we\u2019re close to the same age, right?\u201d</p><p>She blinked even as she found a hidden Snickers and wolfed it down in three unlovely bites. \u201cMmm gsss sssoo.\u201d She was twenty-six. He was twenty-four.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just, you seem older.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFfffnnnkks fffrrr nnnthnng.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a good way, in a good way! You just . . . you know how they say some people are old souls? I never met one before. You\u2019re one of those; you have an old soul tucked behind a young face.\u201d</p><p>You would, too, if you spent your days shoving school buses and foiling robberies and getting stabbed trying to break up a rape and then having to eat the damned knife to have the strength to pummel the rapists.</p><p>\u201cWhich is also interesting,\u201d he finished.</p><p>She swallowed the rest of the candy and held on to the wrapper. She would eat it as soon as he was gone. Also the four empty file folders she\u2019d found. And possibly the pencil shavings out of the electric sharpener. A pity there had been no time to replenish her work stash. But her work stash might be what led to those unlovely notes.</p><p>The whole thing made her tired. And, to be honest, a little angry. She\u2019d stopped asking herself why me, why me, why am I the one stuck with this, woe, woe years ago, but sometimes it snuck back into her brain. \u201cWell, thank you, I suppose. And now I have to kick you out. Work, work, work. But I\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProb\u2019ly not; tomorrow\u2019s a holiday, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is?\u201d Her heart sank. Literally: it actually felt like it swelled from adrenaline and then dropped down to her belly button. \u201cI won\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreenery Day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could I have forgotten?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you believe it\u2019s that time of year again?\u201d he asked with exaggerated surprise. \u201cJapanese nature holidays just sneak right up, don\u2019t they? To think I\u2019ve left my Greenery Day shopping \u2019til the last minute.\u201d</p><p>She cracked up; she couldn\u2019t help it. Which got him started, so in seconds they were both yowling like hyenas behind her closed office door.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d he said at last, wiping his eyes, \u201chappy Greenery Day Eve.\u201d Ignoring her snort, he added, \u201cUh, maybe you\u2019d want to get together tomorrow for a\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014movie or someth\u2014What? Oh. Great.\u201d He smiled again, that wonderful smile. His obvious pleasure in her acceptance almost negated her embarrassment that she\u2019d hurried to say yes before he had a chance to finish the question.</p><p>Which was insane. Knowing what she knew and, worse, what she didn\u2019t know.</p><p>I don\u2019t know him: bad. He\u2019s a nice boy, but exactly that: a boy. Worse. Or not. And that\u2019s the worst of all.</p><p>They worked out the details\u2014lunch, tomorrow, Big Bowl in the Galleria, 11:30, maybe a movie after. Then he bid her a courteous good-bye and shut the door behind him with a firm click.</p><p>She instantly stuffed the wrapper in her mouth, followed by several pens she kept for emergencies, the ones out of ink.</p><p>Funny, she mused, chewing. I feel loads better, though nothing has changed. I\u2019m still a mess. I still work here. Evil has still not been vanquished. I\u2019m still getting those annoying notes.</p><p>And I can\u2019t wait for 11:30 tomorrow.</p><p>CHAPTER FIVE</p><p>Seriously: Did You Think This Was a Joke?</p><p>Linus found Big Bowl with no problems but hadn\u2019t known he would. So because he left himself plenty of time to arrive, he was forty-five minutes early. And delighted to find Hailey already waiting. Part of him had spent the night worrying she\u2019d forget about their date, or would change her mind before they even sat down, or would rush off before the pot stickers came because she\u2019d double booked herself. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>So he spoke without thinking when he saw her: \u201cHey, you\u2019re here! Great!\u201d And was mortified by his big mouth, and relieved by her smile.</p><p>\u201cOh, I wouldn\u2019t miss it.\u201d Then she frowned, as if she might have said too much. He was pleasantly startled to see her hair was lighter today; the red was fading to pure blond.</p><p>They sat, chatted with the friendly waitress, ordered dumplings and soup and pot stickers and peanut noodles. And talked, of course: about people they knew, about their homes, about (of course) their jobs, and other shared interests.</p> <p>\u201cI was really hoping for an It Girl sighting.\u201d</p><p>Hailey instantly frosted: \u201cWhy? She\u2019s not real. And if she was, well . . . that would make her a glory-seeking moron.\u201d</p><p>Which was how he found out Hailey Derry had no love for heroes.</p><p>\u201cOh, come on,\u201d he coaxed, stupidly ignoring the warning signs. \u201cI\u2019ve lived here half my life. I know\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHalf?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe a third. We moved here when I was little, then headed up to Duluth until I finished my UMD degree. Anyway, I know people who\u2019ve seen her . . . She\u2019s real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA real idiot.\u201d The waitress plunked down two plates of dumplings, and Hailey speared one with a single chopstick and tossed it into her mouth. \u201cWho does things like that? Who could, and who would? She\u2019s a YouTube myth. They talk about her because they can\u2019t get her to talk. They can\u2019t prove her and it just makes them want her more. My mother\u2014\u201d She cut herself off and sucked down another vegetable dumpling.</p><p>Whoa. Deep water. \u201cYeah? Your mom? She says she saw her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh . . . no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas she from around here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBriefly. Like you.\u201d Hailey smiled a little, more a quirk of her lips than a warm expression. \u201cI was born here and then . . . we left.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Linus felt like he was in a minefield. A minefield of pot stickers. He tried to sound noncommittal, like he didn\u2019t much care what she was saying, or wasn\u2019t listening very hard. It was strange, but sometimes that was the best way to keep someone talking. \u201cBorn, then left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. She had to\u2014she was infertile, see? And unmarried. And rich. Don\u2019t forget that last part; it\u2019s important later.\u201d Another small, bitter smile. \u201cShe went to a clinic. Several times, in fact. Got pregnant, stayed here through her pregnancy, my birth, all that. Then left. Promised never to return. And never did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d He sucked down half his ginger ale. He couldn\u2019t recall being on a more stressful first date.</p><p>\u201cThe point is, she had to spend a lot of money to get me. And my mother always valued the things that were the most expensive, the things she actually had to work for. Coach bags. Louis Vuitton suitcases. Cl\u00e9 de Peau Beaut\u00e9 cream. A last-minute lunch rez at Menton. Dinner at Addison\u2019s. And me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Weirder and weirder. It\u2019s wrong that her intensity is turning me on, right?</p><p>\u201cAnyway.\u201d Hailey had trailed off and was staring over his shoulder, then seemed to regain her train of thought. \u201cShe died a couple of years ago. And I didn\u2019t have anything to hold me to New York. So I came back here. Where I began. Where she first started to value me, before she ever saw me. Long, long before she knew me. Which brings me back to my point\u2014the only reason people have any interest or liking in that person\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt Girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwful, awful name\u2014yes. My point: they can\u2019t know. So because it\u2019s not quantifiable but is assumed to be extraordinary, she\u2019s valued. If you found out she was your next-door neighbor, you wouldn\u2019t be interested anymore.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou mean you wouldn\u2019t. Because if It Girl was my neighbor, I\u2019d only have about a zillion questions. Savage and It Girl: a killer combo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the other thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d The waitress had returned with more plates brimming with noodles and dumplings, which she was wolfing down in a way that both alarmed and intrigued him. The weirdest things this woman does that get me hot. Swear to God!</p><p>\u201cYou might not yet realize this, since you haven\u2019t spent a lot of time here in the last two decades, but this town is strange. The company you work for is strange. This entire area is very, very odd.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but in a good way, right? Ha!\u201d His chopsticks had blocked hers just in time. \u201cYou can have the last vegetable pot sticker. I get the last chicken one.\u201d He whacked her chopstick again, eliciting a giggle. \u201cBegone!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, take it.\u201d She leaned back, smiling, but the smile disappeared when she again looked over his shoulder. \u201cI don\u2019t have a problem with the notes, I don\u2019t think. But there are more direct ways to get your message across.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019m just gonna pretend that the thing you just said had something\u2014anything\u2014to do with the other things you said. Because otherwise you\u2019ll know you\u2019ve lost me.\u201d</p><p>She leaned forward. He was a good boy and did not scope her cleavage, which he absolutely could have, since she was wearing a forest green tank top under a black linen jacket. Linen pants, too, and little green shoes; his ex from college had been into pretty shoes, so now he noticed women\u2019s shoes, and knew Manolos were so 2005. He didn\u2019t necessarily want to notice them, or know Manolos were so 2005, but it was just how things were now. Breakups change people.</p><p>\u201cLinus, listen. We work in a town called Savage, which once upon a time had the slightly less awful name of Hamilton until a rich guy named Marion Savage bought a horse called Dan Patch and, when that horse won a few races, they changed the name of the city.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d He paused, slurped the forkful of peanut noodles, swallowed. \u201cSo Savage is named after a horse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf only. Savage is named after the guy who bought the horse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarion was a guy?\u201d\u2020</p><p>\u201cLike that makes any of this better? Oh, and at least a third of us graduated from Cretin High School\u2014yes, that\u2019s Cretin High School, and we work for a company that makes big metal animals that people can shoot at, and our mutual boss hardly ever comes in because she\u2019s determined to turn broomball into an Olympic sport. Let\u2019s see, did I miss anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see why you\u2019re down on the horse. He was a terrific horse. Audrey the Receptionist told me Dan Patch broke world records for speed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs a harness horse,\u201d she replied, scorn heavy on harness. \u201cMy point is, get out. Get out while you still can, I pray you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis explains Dan Patch Drive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Dan Patch Lane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Don\u2019t forget Dan Patch Day. It\u2019s horses or Cretins around here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd superheroes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMyth,\u201d she said. She wiped her mouth, stood, grabbed her purse, and said, \u201cI have to go the bathroom. It was lovely talking to you.\u201d</p><p>He figured she wasn\u2019t coming back from the bathroom and . . . nope. She was not. When he asked the waitress for the check, she replied that his date had paid the entire bill and left. (\u201cShe was in a hurry to get somewhere, huh?\u201d)</p><p>Date? Is that what that was?</p><p>He hadn\u2019t walked five feet into the parking lot when he saw the small crowd gathered around a thirtyish, tearful redhead cradling a squalling (also redhead) infant. \u201cI locked my keys in\u2014stupid, stupid! And shut the door, and then Renee was locked in! And I didn\u2019t know what to do and I forgot my phone and then that lady fixed it! There, baby, it\u2019s okay. Mom\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it was locked, ma\u2019am,\u201d a teenage girl said doubtfully, looking at the rear passenger door. \u201cYour door\u2019s busted, though. Good thing you didn\u2019t really lock her in. Guess you just didn\u2019t yank good enough.\u201d</p><p>Curious, Linus peeked around the teenager.</p><p>The handle of the door had been twisted, as if it were made of steel-colored bread dough instead of steel-colored steel.</p><p>(Much later, he realized: eagerness to see him might not have explained her showing so early. She\u2019d picked a booth near the windows and took the side with her back to the wall. She had an excellent view of not only the entire restaurant but the parking lot outside.</p><p>And what was that about notes?)</p><p>CHAPTER SIX</p><p>Why Aren\u2019t You Doing More?</p><p>A couple of her fellow employees\u2014and someone she didn\u2019t know\u2014were amiably grumbling about being back at work so soon after Greenery Day. Hailey got there for the last of the conversation (shockingly early for her, which was to say, only twenty minutes late).</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t believe it\u2019s gonna be another whole year.\u201d The Old Coot sighed, comfortably sprawled in one of the plush chairs in the reception area. He looked up and waved. \u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt goes by so quickly,\u201d Audrey the Receptionist agreed. \u201cBut Arbor Day will be here in no time.\u201d She turned to face the new hire and held out her hand. \u201cHi. I\u2019m Audrey the Receptionist. You must be Jennifer.\u201d And then, when she spotted Hailey, \u201cWhoa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, don\u2019t make a big deal out of this,\u201d Hailey warned, digging in her purse for the last of the M&amp;M\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re shockingly early. Which is to say\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014only twenty minutes late,\u201d Audrey finished.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJennifer, this is Hailey, the head of HR. Don\u2019t do anything she does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s sound advice,\u201d Hailey said to Jennifer, who was another petite, pale blue-eyed Nordic blonde from the wilds of southern Minnesota. \u201cWelcome aboard. One of my minions passed on your new-hire packet to me, so we\u2019ll get you through this paperwork and get you set up inside.\u201d She scooped the last of the candy into her mouth, chewed, realized she was also chewing a couple of pennies and a paper clip, and in the future resolved to look before she chomped. Or at least keep the candy separate from the non-candy. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShe has tons of minions,\u201d Audrey the Receptionist said helpfully. \u201cSomeday you, too, might be one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDare to dream.\u201d The Old Coot poked at his iPad. \u201cThis thing needs charging again? It\u2019s only been twenty hours! In my day\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Hailey and Audrey said. Hailey glanced at Jennifer. \u201cUh, I don\u2019t normally condone telling colleagues to shut up.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLike I said: don\u2019t do anything she does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn fairness, she only tells me to shut up. Everyone else she tells to hush. But Aud\u2019s right: not doing anything Hailey does is a surefire way to go right to the top,\u201d The Old Coot said. \u201cOr get saved by It Girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat makes no sense,\u201d Audrey pointed out. \u201cOne thing\u2019s got nothing to do with the other, you twenty-nine-year-old senile freak. And there\u2019s no such thing as It Girl.\u201d</p><p>The Old Coot ignored her. \u201cBut no fair \u2018accidentally\u2019 parking your car on the railroad tracks in the hopes that she\u2019ll save you and you\u2019ll get something new for YouTube. Not to mention a new in-my-day-superhero-vigilantes-actually-tried-to-cover-their-faces-and-not-get-on-the-news story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019d never,\u201d Jennifer said, looking from The Old Coot to Audrey the Receptionist to Hailey, her glances so quick they could almost hear her eyeballs clicking: back and forth, back and forth, click-click-click. \u201cI don\u2019t . . . There\u2019s no such thing, anyway, right? Like Audrey said?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy name is Audrey the Receptionist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really should try to get our names right,\u201d The Old Coot said kindly. \u201cIt\u2019s the least you can do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe least she can do is nothing,\u201d Hailey pointed out. The least you can do followed by someone doing something besides nothing was a pet peeve of hers, along with people who thought switching sides meant doing a three-sixty.\u2021</p><p>Jennifer tried again but was still giving off trapped-like-a-rat-in-a-room-with-crazy-people vibes. \u201cIt Girl\u2014I figured she was one of those, whatchamacallits . . . a meme. Or an urban legend. Something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the spirit!\u201d Hailey cried. Meme! Oh, that\u2019s wonderful! Planking, Faith Hilling, It Girling! Either way, a silly fad no one actually takes seriously.</p><p>\u201cNot this again,\u201d The Old Coot groaned. \u201cOf course she\u2019s real. People have seen her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you hear yourself?\u201d Audrey the Receptionist cried. \u201cLife is not a Marvel comic book. There are no superheroes. I feel dumb just telling you that. What, did you also see a blurry picture of a Sasquatch and decide Bigfoot\u2019s real, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would be terrific,\u201d Hailey said, \u201cif you didn\u2019t compare It Girl to Bigfoot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNew kid rules the tie . . . so, Jennifer, is It Girl real? And if she is, is she real-real, or if-it\u2019s-on-the-Internet-it-must-be-true real? Or a hoax or a hallucination or a sinister government cover-up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\u2014I\u2019m not sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, guess. Or narrow the question down further: which one of your new colleagues is batshit crazy for believing everything she sees, and which is the logical fountain of organized thought through which wisdom flows?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just go find my desk and stuff now,\u201d Jennifer said, slowly backing away. She bumped into Hailey and didn\u2019t notice, just backed away more quickly.</p><p>They listened to the receding clack-clack-clack of Jennifer\u2019s heels hitting tile, then the thud-thud-thud of them hitting carpet.</p><p>\u201cThat poor kid.\u201d Hailey sighed.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s not going to make it,\u201d Audrey the Receptionist said. \u201cNot if one harmless conversation about which of us needs psychotropic meds freaks her out. This is no place for the timid. Just the weird. And you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, what?\u201d Hailey was fumbling for her phone . . . Linus was texting her again. A good trick, since she hadn\u2019t given him her cell number. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on. You know what. I know you have hair ADD, but you\u2019ve gone eight shades darker in three days.\u201d</p><p>That was only the truth; Hailey\u2019s mop of unruly strands had been medium brown when she woke up two hours ago. She did not want to think about what that meant, and so did not.</p><p>\u201cI just think you could try a shade slightly longer than, oh, eleven hours? Maybe? Sometimes you have. Sometimes an entire week goes by and your hair remains the same color. It\u2019s eerie, but also nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush,\u201d she told her absently. Again, Audrey was correct, and again, Hailey didn\u2019t want to think about what that meant.</p><p>Besides, she was quite fond of Audrey the Receptionist. It was hard not to like someone who found the whole your-job-is-your-identity thing so silly she referred to herself, constantly, by her first name and job title. All the time. Everywhere: at work, at home, at the grocery story, at family reunions. \u201cMy hair is my hair, and it\u2019s silly that we\u2019re talking about it at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just do not even care that you\u2019re so utterly, utterly weird, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for a while now,\u201d she admitted, and hurried back to her office.</p><p>\u201cTwenty-four hours!\u201d Audrey the Receptionist called after her. \u201cMaybe even thirty-six! Hey, how about forty-eight whole hours with the same hair color? Just think it over! That\u2019s all I\u2019m asking.\u201d She plunked back down in her chair. \u201cIt\u2019s not that much to ask,\u201d she said to no one, and turned back to her computer.</p><p>CHAPTER SEVEN</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d Hailey said upon entering her office. Linus was instantly on his feet when he saw her. \u201cThere you are. I got your texts.\u201d Another unpleasant fact she did not wish to dwell on, but had to. Best apologize first, and then get to it. \u201cI know you must be angry about our lunch, and I\u2019m sorry I had to mmmmm uumm mmm.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d mumbled the last because he\u2019d grasped her by the shoulders, and kissed her on the mouth. She was so startled she dropped her briefcase, mentally groaning at the thought of the folders spilling everywhere (stupid broken zipper!). No, wait\u2014that was verbal groaning, specifically, her verbal groans. Possibly because Linus was an amazing kisser. A wonderful kisser. An astounding kisser. What briefcase?</p><p>\u201cAstounding!\u201d she said, pulling back with real regret. \u201cYou are wonderful! Which is bad. Why did you do that? It was . . . ah . . . astounding. Yes. The perfect word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, thanks, I had to,\u201d he replied, which made no sense. Worse, she didn\u2019t much care. \u201cI mean, you\u2019re a department head and I\u2019m just an accounting cog. Probably you\u2019d get in trouble if you nailed my lips at the office. Not that I\u2019d mind,\u201d he assured her. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t! And I wouldn\u2019t sue for sexual harassment or anything. Unless that\u2019s what you\u2019re into. So I figured we\u2019d talk and I\u2019d ask you and then I sort of forgot about that and kissed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never understand half of what comes out of your mouth,\u201d she complained, but she was glowing. She knew it; she could actually feel herself all warm and flushed and happy and ready for more kisses.</p><p>Which was all just awful, really. Under the circumstances.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand half of what comes out of my mouth?\u201d His eyebrows arched; his sweet mouth curled into a darling grin. \u201cHave you heard yourself ever?\u201d</p><p>She sighed. By not smacking him, or suing him, she\u2019d made the situation worse. And now there was nothing for it but to plunge. Glowing feeling fading . . . fading . . . gone. \u201cLook, you don\u2019t have to do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretend to like me to cover up the notes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just want to know what your purpose is. To out me? To complain about my work habits? To put more pressure on me as an individual or us as a society? What?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you talking about those Post-its you walk around with all the time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not all the time,\u201d she said, trying to keep her anger in check. \u201cIt\u2019s only since you got here, which you must very well know. What I want to know is why\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHailey: I\u2019ve never left you a single Post-it.\u201d He rolled his (big, dark, beautiful) eyes and shook his head. She had the impression he wanted to shake her but had decided against it, at least for the time being. \u201cWhy would I ever be okay with words on a tiny yellow piece of paper when I could see you in person and hear your voice and look at your eyes and your weird, always-changing hair and your four-seasons-ago Coach Lena flats?\u201d</p><p>She stared down at her feet. \u201cFour seasons\u2014okay, this proves you\u2019re spying on me. How else would you know how long I\u2019ve had these\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not spying on you! I\u2019m not leaving Post-its and I have no idea where you live, although I\u2019d love to be invited over for dinner and you could run off and leave anytime you wanted though I\u2019d hope you\u2019d stay at least through the first course, and I\u2019ll cook if you don\u2019t want to because\u2014\u201d</p><p>He was like a human blender of words. \u201cAgain: I never understand half of what you say, and I also never gave you my cell phone number.\u201d She truly hoped he wasn\u2019t going to morph into a full-blown crook weirdo stalker she would then have to pummel after eating the contents of her In bin. \u201cBut you\u2019ve texted me multiple times, the notes started showing the same week you did\u2014\u201d Had he only been there a week? Had all this madness been happening for a mere seven days? She felt like she\u2019d been listening to yet not understanding him for much longer. She felt like they\u2019d known each other and amused the hell out of each other for much, much longer.</p><p>She also wished he\u2019d kissed her for much longer.</p><p>Stupid thinking, especially if he turns out to be dangerously deranged instead of merely deranged.</p><p>\u201cSure, I\u2019ve got your number\u2014you gave it to me.\u201d His hand plunged into his front left pocket (khakis, she noted approvingly, which was fine for business-casual Friday) and he pulled out a tiny yellow stamp. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>No: it was a Post-it note. She saw he had very carefully folded it with crisp corners, and folded it again, and again, so it was teeny and yellow and a bare half-inch across. \u201cI have little pockets,\u201d he mumbled, his pale freckled skin blushing, \u201cand didn\u2019t want to lose it, so I was careful when I stuck it in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is so adorable I might pass out.\u201d It was. I must stop saying these things out loud to him. She carefully unfolded it, observed her cell number written in handwriting not her own, then carefully refolded it (teeny origami!) and gave it back, feeling loads better. \u201cI didn\u2019t write that.\u201d In fact, she had a solid idea who did. The relief that Linus seemed to like her for herself was enough to make her knees weak. Or was a residual symptom of his kiss. \u201cI didn\u2019t leave that for you. Isn\u2019t that great?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d His blush deepened. \u201cI guess you didn\u2019t mean for me to have it, then. Here.\u201d He tried to hand back the teeny origami but she wouldn\u2019t take it.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant! I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t mean\u2014it\u2019s fine that you have my number. It\u2019s not a state secret or anything.\u201d She felt awful, knowing he thought she thought he\u2019d been a creep and, worse, a creep she did not want to give her digits to. His dear face was rapidly nearing the color of a ripe beefsteak tomato. It was strange, but his mortification touched her almost as much as his kiss had. His sweet kiss and his dear face and now he couldn\u2019t look at her; he was in an agony of embarrassment and she had never felt more tender and protective of anyone, ever, in her life. \u201cSee? I can prove it. Like this.\u201d</p> <p>Then she seized his shoulders, yanked him forward, and kissed him back.</p><p>CHAPTER EIGHT</p><p>Sometime later (seconds, hours, a month?) they both came up for air. They\u2019d staggered around her office like two people trapped in a sack together, their arms around each other, kissing with the fury of two people who had remembered that often the best part of a relationship was the part they were embarked on right that moment, in her office, on her Corporate Yawn\u2013colored carpet.</p><p>Linus hadn\u2019t even remembered when they\u2019d left their feet. He was having trouble remembering any specifics at all. He had been so glad to see her and so happy to kiss her and so angry to realize she thought he was pretending to like her and then\u2014pretending? What the hell? Who would? And why?</p><p>He had no idea how someone could fake being enchanted by a beautiful smart wonderful woman like Hailey Derry (hero, hero). He hadn\u2019t been able to think straight for days; who could fake that? The thought upset him all over again and he instinctively put a hand to her. She took it, turned it over, and planted a soft kiss on his palm that he instantly felt . . . somewhere else.</p> <p>\u201cI never thought the name Linus was especially erotic.\u201d She shook her head and let him take his hand back (not that he was in any rush to do so). \u201cHow little I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. More fool you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the name. Do it to me, Linus. Fill me up, Linus. Ooooh, give it to me haaaard, Linus!\u201d She raised her voice to be heard over his helpless laughter. \u201cIf you kissed me as some sort of negative reinforcement because I ducked out on lunch, it was an utter failure.\u201d</p><p>They were both sitting on the carpet, thoroughly rumpled. They\u2019d both called a halt right around the time they both went for the other\u2019s shirt buttons. (\u201cUh . . . probably not the best idea.\u201d \u201cRight.\u201d \u201cIn my office, I mean.\u201d \u201cRight.\u201d \u201cTo be continued.\u201d \u201cDamn right.\u201d)</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t negative reinforcement. I was just so damned glad to see you. You came rushing in like you do, in a hurry, and I\u2019ve sort of been worried about you, but when you rushed in, you looked so gorgeous the reason I was waiting went right out of my head.\u201d He sobered, hopped to his feet, then helped her to hers. \u201cHailey, I\u2019ve got to talk to you. And you have to stay in this room with me until you\u2019ve answered my questions. I\u2019m not trying to come on like some Rambo jerkweed chauvinist, but come on. Something\u2019s up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRambo jerkweed chauvinist?\u201d</p> <p>He didn\u2019t smile back. \u201cYou disappear all the time, you come back looking like somebody\u2019s beat you up, your mind\u2019s on something else\u2014a lot.\u201d He took a breath, then let it out. \u201cI\u2019m the new guy and even I know something\u2019s wrong. I talked to Audrey the Receptionist while we were waiting for her girlfriend to pick her up the other night, and she said you were totally fine, and that you\u2019re kind of a nut about your privacy, which I totally respect\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said, butting into her privacy.\u201d But she was smiling, so he plunged ahead.</p><p>He tried again. \u201cI know we haven\u2019t known each other very long\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly a week! Isn\u2019t that amazing?\u201d She looked so happy when she said that, every thought went out of his head except for, Must kiss pretty girl more now, yes, yes. \u201cIt feels like longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Must kiss pretty . . . Linus shook himself. \u201cRight. But you\u2019re in trouble, Hailey. Aren\u2019t you? Tell me. Let me help.\u201d He took a breath. Waited. Thought, Yep, I\u2019m really gonna ask her this. Said: \u201cDon\u2019t get mad, but you\u2019re It Girl, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER NINE</p><p>\u201cOkay. I know it sounded crazy, but I just had to\u2014wait. You said yes. You admitted it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes. Also, I hate that name. Rhymes with Zit Girl and Pit Girl and Hit Girl\u2014people all over the Web think I\u2019m plagiarizing Mark Millar.\u201d She\u2019d finished adjusting her clothing and now stood on one foot, rested her hand lightly on his shoulder, then slipped her other shoe back on. \u201cNow then. Since you didn\u2019t hack my digits, that means\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHailey, come on. If you don\u2019t want to tell me what\u2019s wrong, you\u2019ve at least got to agree to call a cop!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m It Girl.\u201d She actually shuddered as she said it. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s going on. My God, I actually said it out loud and everything . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, come on. Okay, I admit, it was a silly idea, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d She\u2019d slipped her other shoe on, and was now unbuttoning his shirt (hooray!) and then rebuttoning it (boo!), this time with the appropriate buttons going into the appropriate holes. His head was still so full of her scent and her smile he was amazed he\u2019d gotten any buttons into any holes. \u201cWhat\u2019s so silly? Other than the absurdity of a grown woman finding out she\u2019s living the life of an escapee from a graphic novel.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d been almost sure, but her quick response threw him. \u201cLook, I know you\u2019re in trouble. Please, please let me help. Okay, so you\u2019re not It Girl . . . It was a dumb idea. I mean, you work hard for us\u2014when you\u2019re here\u2014but you\u2019re kind of, um, disorganized . . .\u201d He gestured; files were everywhere. \u201cAnd you\u2019re always late or leaving early; and even when you\u2019re not at work, you\u2019re always rushing off somewhere. You\u2019re never around when . . . um . . . when . . .\u201d Just like that, he\u2019d talked himself back into the silly idea that Hailey Derry was It Girl.</p><p>\u201cAll those things you said, they\u2019re true.\u201d</p><p>This was not how it went in the movies. The cornered superhero would have all sorts of reasons why they weren\u2019t Superman or Vomit Girl or Hernia Boy or whomever, and they\u2019d be able to back it up with airtight alibis by faithful butlers, statements that were typed and notarized. They didn\u2019t say, \u201cYep, you got me. You have found out my deep, dark secret. Woe, now the truth is out! Anyway, try not to blab it all over town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019ll prove it.\u201d</p><p>They didn\u2019t say that, either.</p><p>Then Hailey rummaged through a desk drawer, pulled out a jumbo box of staples, and gulped down not only all the staples, but the box they were in, and then the stapler they\u2019d been intended for.</p><p>Which, once he got over his shock, was the coolest\u2014</p><p>\u201cLinus?\u201d</p><p>\u2014thing\u2014</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u2014ever.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got you.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TEN</p><p>\u201cThank God.\u201d Hailey sighed when Linus opened his eyes.</p><p>\u201cThat was awesome,\u201d he said weakly. He moved his head enough to realize it was pillowed on her lap, that they were still in her office (thank goodness for doors that closed, and employees who, unlike Hailey, went to meetings in other parts of the building), then started to sit up. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t faint.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI blacked out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I was a little shocked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd also extremely turned on. That was awesome! I never knew a woman could look so damn hot while chomping down staples. So all the blood left my head and rushed . . . uh . . . somewhere else . . . and . . .\u201d She was laughing so hard she almost dropped him. \u201cOkay, but we agree I didn\u2019t faint like a girlie girl, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. Absolutely. Your rep as a stellar stud who never faints when confronted by a freak who\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that.\u201d Surprised, she drew back a little. \u201cSorry. But don\u2019t, Hailey. You\u2019re not a freak. You\u2019re terrific. You are the polar opposite of a freak, okay? Run yourself down like that again and I\u2019ll kiss the shit out of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat will certainly teach me, all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you suck at keeping your secret identity a secret.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat secret identity? Do I have a costume? Do I rush around the country shoring up falling buildings or catching planes before they crash only to dash off and go back to my job as a mild-mannered HR director, always on the alert for evil and help desk seminars? No. If I\u2019m in a situation where I can help, I do. I\u2019m no different from an off-duty EMT. They\u2019ll help if they can, even if they\u2019re on their own time. That\u2019s just how things are for them. And me, too, I guess.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThen why not tell the world?\u201d</p><p>She snorted, which on any other woman would have been unlovely, but on her, was hot. \u201cTo what end?

Nobody? Come on. Nobody? Ever? Really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHailey, come on. I\u2019ve been here a week and I figured it out. Other people know, I promise.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged again. \u201cIf they do, they\u2019ve never said. And what am I going to do, run around asking people if they think I\u2019m It Girl? Linus, I promise you: the world is full of people who are mildly interested but, in the end, don\u2019t give much of a shit either way. Their own lives and their own problems are much, much more interesting than \u2018It Girl vs. Sasquatch: Live on pay-per-view!\u2019 Trust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeez.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is one of those times you sound a lot older than me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt sounds so bleak and horrible when you put it like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cIt just sounds true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes this\u2014\u201d He broke off and thought about it a little more while Hailey prowled the room, putting her office to rights. \u201cHailey, does this\u2014these things you can do\u2014do they have anything to do with your mom having trouble getting pregnant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy God.\u201d She was staring at him and he realized (when had that happened? While he\u2019d been passed out on her lap?) her hair had dramatically lightened in less than five minutes. \u201cYou are quick, Linus. To put it together so\u2014I mean, I had to think about it for years. So apparently I\u2019m older, but you\u2019re smarter. And, yes. I think so. My mom needed the clinic to get her pregnant. She donated eggs and they had to do things to the eggs, and once I was born, she got the hell out of Savage and never came back. She died a couple of years ago . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you . . . and I kind of drifted back here on my own. One of these days I\u2019ll get really brave and go see those doctors.\u201d She shoved her (now blond) hair back from her face. \u201cBut not today. Today I must fight evil, and make out with an accountant some more. My kingdom for a ponytail holder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that because you ate the stapler?\u201d he asked excitedly, jabbing his finger at her hair. \u201cAnd it\u2019ll fade as you, um, digest the stapler? And the staples? And the box?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut right now you\u2019re super strong and fast and everything?\u201d</p><p>She was smiling again. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re thinking about how you rushed across the room in half a blink and handily caught me as I swooned, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoooooo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiar.\u201d</p><p>Her beautiful smile lit up her face. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He was dazzled; it was hard to look away from her. Good thing he didn\u2019t want to. \u201cWhy are you looking at me like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just . . . it\u2019s so nice, Linus. Telling you these things and you not treating me like a fr\u2014like I\u2019m different.\u201d She paused and her wistful expression actually hurt his heart like a cramp. \u201cI didn\u2019t know it could be nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice is an understatement. And different is awesome.\u201d He went to her and smoothed the light strands back from her eyes. \u201cDifferent kicks ass. Different is the sexiest thing ever.\u201d</p><p>Then he kissed her for a lovely long time, and breathed in her sweet smoky scent, and felt her small, warm, strong hands on him, and forgot about It Girl and lost himself in Hailey.</p><p>CHAPTER ELEVEN</p><p>Too, too soon Hailey had to call a halt. \u201cNot that I don\u2019t think we need to go somewhere private and finish this,\u201d she said, letting go of him so quickly he staggered. \u201cOh! Sorry! There, let the blood rush back into your head. The bigger one,\u201d she added with a wicked smile. He groaned but kept his hands off her. \u201cBut if you\u2019re not leaving nasty little notes for me, someone is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd they wanted me to have your cell phone number.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sure they did.\u201d What else to eat? vzyl What else? Need to be on the safe side. Who knows what depth of evil they\u2019ve gotten up to in their nasty little dungeon? \u201cThey probably waited to start this until there was a new hire. You\u2019re their red herring, Linus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Very nice.\u201d He sounded pissed on her behalf as well as his own, which she could not help but adore him for. \u201cYou sound like you know who it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not much of a mystery. Just like me being able to do the things I do isn\u2019t much of one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Come on, Hailey! You\u2019re the only one who can . . .\u201d He trailed off and she knew why. He was thinking about all the odd things on YouTube, the videos that had been proven fakes and the ones that hadn\u2019t. The Web, curling and coiling around the planet with strands of information reaching everywhere, always. As technology made the planet smaller, it also demonstrated to people just how little they really knew about the places they lived and the people they knew. \u201cYou don\u2019t think you\u2019re the only one, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Linus, I am not unique in my freakery.\u201d She said it without a trace of self-scorn so he wouldn\u2019t get upset on her behalf again. \u201cThere\u2019s just no way.\u201d She almost told him her number-one suspicion, but held back. She knew about Linus and he knew about her, and not just what they could do to each other. They knew the other would be in their life for . . . well . . . ever. Time enough to explain that her mother donated over two dozen eggs to the clinic. Time enough to point out the strong likelihood of super-powered half siblings running around. \u201cBut Savage is. Especially once you consider the stupid horse. But aside from that, there are all sorts of military bases around, and private companies with military contracts. Camp Savage, for instance, was a military intelligence school. Cargill made ships for the U.S. Navy. The Pine Bend Refinery\u2014one of the largest oil refineries in the country\u2014is just a few miles from here. A couple of decades ago there was a military gunpowder plant not twenty miles from here. I\u2019m telling you, this whole sleepy midwestern town thing, it\u2019s true on the surface, sure. But scratch a little and there are all kinds of secrets. The newsies have been asking, \u2018How can there be superheroes here?\u2019 Ye gods, Linus, how are there not more?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cThis is a lot to take in. And I\u2019m still really horny. But . . . the notes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just the notes. It\u2019s the stuff they preceded. Before you came\u2014this is another reason you\u2019re the red herring, by the way\u2014before you came it was actually pretty quiet around here, and had been for a long time.\u201d</p><p>It was strange, and she could never explain it. Some weeks she was constantly leaping the two stories from her office window to rush into town and foil crime, and also pick up a Subway foot-long (roasted chicken breast, Dijon, tomatoes, cukes, black olives, green peppers, salt and pepper, vinegar and oil). Some weeks her \u201cbitch sense\u201d never so much as twitched. It was the heat. Except, because it was Minnesota, it wasn\u2019t. It was society. Okay, but society was everywhere. It was a social protest. Except it wasn\u2019t. It was a day that ended with a y.</p><p>Well. Yes. That was as good an explanation as any. Except all the days ended with y.</p><p>She explained this to Linus, who listened carefully and then shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t think someone orchestrated that. Sometimes people wanna do bad, a lot. And sometimes, not so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOverly simplistic,\u201d she scoffed.</p><p>\u201cAnd big-time realistic,\u201d he countered, softening the words with a small smile. \u201cHon, if you try to find the logic, you\u2019ll give yourself a migraine.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018Hon\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. As in, Attila the.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOooh, later for you, you liar.\u201d She ignored the shredder and went for the potted plant in the corner, a sad little geranium she frequently forgot to water. \u201cSorry, little buddy.\u201d She wolfed it down, grimaced at the dirt, and ate that, too.</p><p>\u201cWhoa,\u201d Linus said, even more big-eyed than usual. \u201cThat\u2019s awesome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNuh-uh,\u201d she said, lightly spraying him with dirt. \u201cI can eat anything and convert it to energy. That\u2019s it. Doesn\u2019t mean I like it. Any of it. Dirt tastes like dirt. Dead flowers taste like dead flowers. Staplers taste\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Got it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlus I\u2019m a stress eater.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to laugh, she could see, but couldn\u2019t help it. She frowned at him, broke the pot, then started eating the shards. \u201cI see the funny side of it. Occasionally. So that\u2019s all right.\u201d</p><p>He was grinning, and reached out with his thumb to brush dirt off the corner of her mouth. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna have a good time, aren\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d she promised, and gulped down the last chunk of the broken flowerpot. \u201cStarting right now.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWELVE</p><p>\u201cWhen you agreed we\u2019d have fun,\u201d Linus was saying as he hurried down the hall to keep pace with her, \u201cI sort of thought you meant we\u2019d both call in sick for the rest of the day and spend the afternoon naked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that, too. But I\u2019ve had enough of the notes, and I do not like, at all, that they had no problem manipulating me into doubting your motives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, when you said at all like that, it made me incredibly nervous. So, just for the record, I\u2019m going to try hard to not do anything that would make you talk about me like that. Ever, ever, ever.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201c\u2018Get to it already.\u2019\u201d They were through HR, past reception.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018What are you waiting for?\u2019\u201d She was nearly stomping down the hall. Past R &amp; D. Past Marketing.</p> <p>\u201cHailey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe notes. \u2018Get to it already, what are you waiting for? If you don\u2019t act, we will. Did you think this was a joke? Why aren\u2019t you doing more?\u2019\u201d</p><p>Linus was gaping at her, appalled. \u201cThat\u2019s what they wrote you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s just nag-nag-nag with those people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose people?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAt first, I assumed it was about work. I have, as you\u2019ve noticed, a terrible attendance record. But why be sneaky about it? This is the easiest company to work for in the history of business. No one needs to be sneaky about anything, and we all know it. And then you showed up. And then accidents started happening that required immediate action. My immediate action.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe school bus,\u201d Linus remembered.</p><p>\u201cChildren. They endangered children. Because they didn\u2019t think I was performing up to par.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, who else? Who would be passive as well as aggressive? Who would hide behind documents, behind words, while challenging people to act, even as they don\u2019t act? Come on, Linus. It\u2019s obvious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d Past the break rooms, the conference rooms.</p><p>\u201cEven for them . . . I mean, I know they\u2019re awful, every company in the world knows they\u2019re awful, that they\u2019re a necessary evil, but this is evil evil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d She stopped. They were there. \u201cThe ones whose job it is to spy on their colleagues and then inform on them. The Brownshirts of every company in the world. Who have most of the power while we pretend they don\u2019t, and they pretend they\u2019re not dangerous.\u201d She glared up at the sign. \u201cThe IT department.\u201d</p><p>Linus looked up. \u201cAbandon All Hope and Get Pwned\u201d was over the bloodred double doors in dark cursive font a foot high. \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t abandoned hope already, I would now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you like.\u201d Hailey kicked the sinister red doors open and marched into the Information Technology department, their dire motto directly over her head for a second.</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTEEN</p> <p>The room, kept cool and gloomy, seemed to swallow them. But when Hailey came through the doors, she brought enough light in to scatter at least three IT drones, who scurried out of sight, squeaking and squealing.</p><p>\u201cSo at last, you\u2019ve come.\u201d Edward Smegger turned slowly in his large black office chair, the back so flared it looked like a throne on wheels.</p><p>He was dressed in an alarming uniform of red jeans, white lab coat, and loafers in traffic-cone orange, but no shirt or socks. His shoulder-length gray hair (premature . . . Edward was thirty-one) looked more scraggly and mad scientist-ish than usual. He was so thin the bones of his wrists looked like they could be used as bladed weapons. \u201cI wondered when you\u2019d be here, you pathetic drone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not pathetic,\u201d Linus warned.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Linus,\u201d she replied. \u201cNow then: we\u2019ve had this talk before, Edward. This is not appropriate workplace attire. And you\u2019re supposed to display your employee badge above the waist at all times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe clip hurts my nipple,\u201d he complained.</p><p>\u201cAt least this isn\u2019t jarring or weird,\u201d Linus muttered.</p><p>\u201cAnd out there? In your world you think is so safe and so sane?\u201d He stroked the small white object in his arms. \u201cYour apathy, your refusal of your gifts . . . is that appropriate for the workplace?\u201d</p><p>Distracted by what the man was holding, Linus raised his hand, as if waiting to be called on, and when Edward nodded, asked, \u201cAre you petting a fake cat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m allergic,\u201d he explained primly, stroking the glassy-eyed stuffed animal. \u201cBut l\u2019il \u00c9owyn of Rohan understands me. She\u2019s the one who told me what to do. She is my constant companion, my one and only true friend. And she is here with me now . . . at the scene of my ultimate triumph.\u201d</p><p>As God is my witness, Linus thought, entranced, I can\u2019t think of a thing to say.</p><p>\u201cMoo-ha-ha-ha!\u201d The laughter, which startled the hell out of them, got deeper and villainy-er. \u201cMoo-ha-haaaaa! I\u2014ack! Graaa-uk! Uk! Uk-uk!\u201d Edward coughed, then rubbed l\u2019il \u00c9owyn on his throat like a poultice. \u201cSorry. I\u2019ve been holding that in\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour entire life, I think,\u201d Linus finished, triply freaked out.</p><p>\u201cYes, possibly,\u201d he admitted. \u201cNo need to hold anything in any longer. Not now. Now that we\u2019ve succeeded. Now that we\u2019ve moved you to act. L\u2019il \u00c9owyn counseled patience, and in the end, it was rewarded. All this . . .\u201d He gestured to the gloom-shrouded computers, the chilly atmosphere, the minions lurking out of sight, watching and waiting to see who won. \u201cShe told me how to fool you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFool her?\u201d Linus yelped. \u201cIt took Hailey about ten seconds to figure out you were the bad guy. After she realized I wasn\u2019t the bad guy. And also after . . .\u201d Making out for a while, he\u2019d been about to add, then decided against it. \u201cAnd Hailey was right . . . it\u2019s obvious. Of course the bad guy\u2019s in the IT department! You spy on what we\u2019re doing on our computers\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not supposed to surf Rotten Tomatoes or ESPN or update your Facebook on company time,\u201d Edward whined.</p><p>\u201c\u2014so you can rat us out like, I dunno, Nazi Germany or whatever\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Nazis were into animal conservation, and they were anti-tobacco. And they came up with the Volkswagen.\u201d</p><p>Momentarily thrown (Really? The Volkswagen?), Linus plunged ahead. \u201cAnd when you\u2019re not spying, you\u2019re sneaking around and sitting in judgment because we keep crashing the network but we don\u2019t know why, and no matter what sort of help we need, you pretty much stamp No on everything, and of course you see everything, you know everything. You control the information!\u201d</p><p>Hailey was staring at him.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d he said, surprised. \u201cI guess I\u2019ve got some repressed anger at the IT guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEdward, I\u2019m sorry, you didn\u2019t deserve all that vitriol. Probably. God, the stress of\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod is dead! Only the IT department can help you now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that sort of attitude that gets you in trouble with HR,\u201d she warned. \u201cAs I said during your last disciplinary action, telling employees God is dead and that your department is all the God they need in their cringing pathetic lives is not appropriate workplace behavior. We\u2019ve got a really easygoing CEO, but even she thinks telling people you\u2019re the only God they need is uncool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are living a lie!\u201d L\u2019il \u00c9owyn went flying as Edward abruptly stood. \u201cHiding behind your paper identity, when you owe the world your gifts!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only thing I owe the world are taxes and, possibly, children. And then, of course, more taxes.\u201d She turned to Linus. \u201cMy mother always said we should replace ourselves, kid-wise, and move on. So I think we\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, whatever you want, please don\u2019t take your eyes off the villain,\u201d Linus begged. \u201cHe is freaking me out.\u201d Linus had never before sensed such overwhelming evil from a single person. Sure, everybody knew the IT guys were creepy, asocial weirdos who spent far too much time staring into screens of any sort. And, yeah, you didn\u2019t ever want to meet one in a dark alley. Or cross one. Or engage with one in any social setting, ever. But Edward\u2019s sheer malevolence was more than unsettling. He was a generally scary\u2014</p><p>\u201cI have made you great, It Girl!\u201d</p><p>\u2014nut job.</p><p>\u201cAnd in return I and all my brethren are treated with thinly veiled contempt!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I apologize,\u201d Hailey said in a tone that was frightening in its pleasantness. \u201cI had no intention of veiling my contempt at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shut us off from society, cast us off from the world! We\u2019re cut off from the rest of the world not just physically but psychologically! We have nothing to do but fester and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo insane?\u201d Linus guessed.</p><p>\u201cWell, yes. Like mushrooms,\u201d he admitted. \u201cEvil mushrooms who can run a network from anywhere on the planet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, please. You guys get off on being different. You take pride in it. We don\u2019t cut you off; you guys do it all on your own. You isolate yourselves; it\u2019s your nature. And don\u2019t get me started on your idiotic Help Desk Muppets!\u201d</p><p>Edward gasped so hard Linus wondered if the man was having a heart attack. He shook a trembling finger in Hailey\u2019s direction. \u201cJudas!\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, Judas means praised and admired. So, yeah. Hailey\u2019s definitely a Judas.\u201d</p><p>Hailey was rubbing her forehead. \u201cPlease stop sticking up for me now. Edward, you and any other hacktivists you\u2019ve hidden back there will cease and desist looking for bad situations and making them worse so I, or the National Guard, eventually have to intervene. Then\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s a hacktivist?\u201d Linus asked.</p><p>\u201cA trendy term for cowardly sneaky trespasser.\u201d</p><p>Edward was rubbing his forehead in a gesture identical to Hailey\u2019s. \u201cYes, that\u2019s . . . that\u2019s one I can\u2019t defend. There can be no denying it\u2019s sneaky of us,\u201d he admitted.</p><p>\u201cEdward, here\u2019s how it is. I\u2019m going to continue living my life, and if I\u2019m running around doing the job of a cop or a firefighter or just working on annual reviews, it\u2019s my own business and none of yours. And you? You\u2019re going to jail.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you did to the school bus, and how many other \u2018accidents\u2019 you\u2019ve been responsible for to encourage me to step up, but you can be sure you won\u2019t be doing anything like that ever again. You will turn yourself in. You will confess. You will not take a plea bargain. You will go to jail for quite some time. You will behave; you will forget you ever dreamed the dreams of super villains.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he asked, and Linus was afraid: it was a reasonable question. There was no proof. There were only Hailey\u2019s hunches. Edward didn\u2019t have to admit anything to anyone. He needn\u2019t have confessed what he did to Hailey and Linus. He\u2019d wanted to, which wasn\u2019t the same thing. Linus doubted Edward would just stop. Why would he, when it was getting him what he wanted?</p><p>Even worse, would this lead to a smackdown between the superhero and the villain, an ultimate battle the likes of which the world had never seen and, also, wouldn\u2019t have much interest in? Did he want such a tired clich\u00e9 to happen right in the middle of Ramouette\u2019s IT department?</p><p>What would the consequences be, especially with the company picnic coming up in less than two weeks? Would factions be further splintered? Would Hailey get fired for employing a super villain? Would the super villain bring a wrongful termination suit against Ramouette? Would the state of Minnesota\u2019s department of dislocated workers get involved, guaranteeing hundreds of lost man hours? He foresaw entire square miles of paperwork ahead, and was afraid.</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Edward asked again. \u201cWhy stop now when you\u2019re so close to accepting what you are? When you\u2019re almost ready to understand that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Linus warned.</p><p>\u201c\u2014with great\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you say with great power comes great responsibility, I will do something terrible,\u201d Hailey warned. \u201cMore terrible than I already had in mind, I mean. And if you don\u2019t turn yourself in now, today, you will never recover from what I\u2019ll do to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Edward asked, sounding curious.</p> <p>\u201cBecause I\u2019ll do things to you I won\u2019t be able to take back. For starters, I\u2019ll dissemble and eat your entire server, right now. The whole thing. Every bite. I\u2019ll get it all down, Edward. You won\u2019t be able to stop me; I could break your arm with one hand while smashing up the hard drive with the other. I\u2019ve never actually eaten a fan before, and the server\u2019s got a good one. You need them to keep the tech cool.</p><p>\u201cThe more I\u2019ll eat, the stronger I\u2019ll get. The stronger I\u2019ll get, the more I\u2019ll pull a Hailey smash all over this department, your car, your home. Even if you\u2019ve backed it all up somewhere else, this is your baby. We all know it. It\u2019s actual, physical tech you will never get back. Tech I\u2019ll convert to energy and use to, I don\u2019t know, have sex for a week without stopping, with Linus here. That\u2019s what will happen to your Precious. I\u2019ll use it to have sex. And you won\u2019t have it anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTons of sex!\u201d Linus added.</p><p>\u201cAnd that,\u201d she added, watching all the color fall out of Edward\u2019s face, \u201cthat\u2019s just the first thing to pop into my head. I\u2019ll spend days thinking about how to fuck you up. Weeks. Years.\u201d</p><p>It broke him. Linus saw it at once. It wasn\u2019t the threat. Not even the threat of more threats. It was her face and her tone. She had looked sorry; she had also sounded genuinely sad when she spoke of doing things she couldn\u2019t take back. Like she knew what it was like. Like she had experience with being fucked with, and was sad because she knew the march of events was inevitable.</p><p>It broke him, and he agreed to everything.</p> <p>CHAPTER FOURTEEN</p><p>\u201cToldja,\u201d The Old Coot said, watching as the Savage police hauled a cuffed and raving Edward to a jail cell far, far away.</p><p>\u201cInevitable,\u201d Audrey the Receptionist agreed. \u201cThe second time he told me the only god I should pray to was the server god, I figured he was bound for, I dunno, prison, or the bottom of the Mississippi, or one of Hailey\u2019s sensitivity training seminars. Some wretched fate that would make him pray for death. He must have done something more evil than usual to get you up in his face like that,\u201d Audrey noted. \u201cWhat, did he call you out about being It Girl?\u201d</p><p>For a second Hailey couldn\u2019t breathe. She actually doubted her ears: Had Aud the Rec really said what she thought she had? She stole a glance at Linus, who looked remarkably serene.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it, isn\u2019t it?\u201d The Old Coot asked, observing Hailey\u2019s frozen expression. \u201cWhat\u2019d you do, threaten to eat his tech? If I was It Girl, that\u2019s what I would have done. Actually, I would have trussed him with barbed wire until he looked like an insane hedgehog, then made him watch while I ate allllll his back-ups.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2014How\u2014I\u2014How?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding?\u201d The Old Coot looked at Audrey, who was slowly shaking her head. \u201cIs she kidding?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Fraid not. That\u2019s the extent of the cloud this woman walks around in.\u201d</p> <p>Hailey knew she sounded idiotic but was unable to stop. \u201cThere\u2019s not\u2014I don\u2019t understand\u2014You couldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously with this?\u201d Audrey the Receptionist asked, incredulous. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, you leap out two-story windows and are constantly seen eating things that would kill anybody else. There\u2019s a bus crash or whatever, and suddenly you remember you have to race home and feed your nonexistent cat, and then while you\u2019re feeding the cat we all know you don\u2019t have, someone mysteriously saves the lives of a dozen first graders. Then you come back looking like you\u2019ve been\u2014I dunno\u2014shoving buses off railroad tracks? Of course you\u2019re It Girl! Or a super villain. But we thought you were in on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn on what?\u201d Linus asked. He figured he could get away with it, being new. And Hailey looked so shocked, he was worried she might pull a Linus and faint. Black out, rather. Fainting was for sissies. He took her hand and she clutched at him with panicky fingers.</p><p>\u201cWell. We don\u2019t talk about it so much, but we all know you\u2019re It Girl. We try to look out for you. And in return we figured you\u2019ve been looking out for us, getting us all those awesome paid holidays, keeping the boss happy so she\u2019s not here trying to get people to practice broomball with . . .\u201d The Old Coot turned to Linus. \u201cBasically Hailey here keeps the human in human resources. We thought you thought we knew that.\u201d</p><p>Astonished silence from Hailey. The Old Coot and Audrey the Receptionist traded glances, then shrugged. \u201cEither way,\u201d Audrey said, \u201cwe\u2019ve been watching out for you. We know you don\u2019t have a life except for\u201d\u2014she waved a hand, vaguely encompassing Ramouette\u2019s offices\u2014\u201cthis. And now, maybe\u201d\u2014waving a hand at Linus\u2014\u201cthat. So the least we can do is cover for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Hailey burst out. Linus was startled\u2014and moved\u2014to see her eyes were brimming with tears. \u201cI\u2019m never\u2014You guys always\u2014And it\u2019s not like I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHailey, jeez.\u201d Audrey sighed, giving her a quick, one-armed hug. \u201cWe live here. Our families live here. And you\u2019re here, too\u2014you could live anywhere in the world. You could be driving anybody else crazy. But you\u2019re here. Driving us crazy.\u201d</p><p>The Old Coot nodded. \u201cThat means a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou spend your days in Savage looking out for our families and friends while also pretending you hate looking out for our families and friends. Which is weird, by the way. But that doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t know what it costs. You have no life. So we back you up whenever we can. You didn\u2019t\u2014Come on. You knew we knew, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cToldja,\u201d Linus coughed into his fist.</p><p>\u201cOh, sure. Yes. Of course. I\u2014\u201d She was smiling and dashing tears away with the back of her hand. \u201cBut I have to go home now and cry for a while. And then have sex with Linus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWeird,\u201d Audrey the Receptionist commented.</p><p>\u201cAnd inappropriate. In my day, HR heads did not run around foiling evil and banging new accountants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, Coot,\u201d Hailey said, and kissed him on the cheek, and hugged Audrey so hard she groaned and clutched her ribs, and seized Linus\u2019s hand and dragged him out.</p><p>\u201cTell you what, Aud, they didn\u2019t do that, either,\u201d he mused, rubbing his cheek. \u201cHmm. Maybe we should get her something extra-nice for Dan Patch Day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPass. I\u2019m gonna take my seventy-four days of accumulated sick time and grow back my ribs. Workers\u2019 comp might hear about this!\u201d Audrey the Receptionist shouted after the departed It Girl. \u201cBut probably not! Let that be a lesson to you! Ow, my ribs . . . How many shopping days is it until Lammas Day?\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER FIFTEEN</p><p>They had every intention of making it to his apartment. No, her apartment . . . it was a shorter drive. No, the Red Roof Inn was shorter still. No, the secret park.</p><p>\u201cSecret park?\u201d Hailey managed between kisses. They\u2019d gotten into her car and kissed. She\u2019d stopped at the stop sign and they kissed. She stopped at the yield sign and they kissed. She didn\u2019t stop and they kissed. \u201cWhere do I live again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, here . . . take a left. Over here.\u201d He pointed and she drove and then she\u2019d stopped the car and he\u2019d gotten out so quickly the seat belt hung on and almost yanked him back inside the car. He wrestled free of it while she leaned against the hood so as to not fall down laughing, and they ran toward a bunch of trees to the left of the small road leading away from Ramouette.</p><p>She gasped in wonder at the small secret park, not perfectly trimmed and manicured like non-secret parks, but overgrown and just wild enough to be interesting but not ugly. The pond, about fifteen feet wide, looked so tranquil as to not seem quite real, reflecting the willow trees, which waved gently in the breeze.</p><p>His fingers were on her blouse and she tried to help him, then realized she didn\u2019t give a good damn about the buttons and yanked.</p><p>\u201cOw!\u201d He clapped a hand to one eye.</p><p>\u201cOh my God!\u201d Stupid It Girl strength; it hadn\u2019t worn off yet. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, let me see.\u201d</p><p>She bent forward, intent on his face, and he snatched her to him for a sound, searching kiss. Then he pulled back with a breathless, \u201cPsych! Just kidding. Can you fly like Superman? Can I be Lois Lane, except without that weird chiffon dress she wore in the first movie? She looked like she was wearing my mom\u2019s bathroom curtains.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPlease shut up now.\u201d She\u2019d shrugged out of her blouse, her bra. \u201cYou\u2019ve never seen anyone here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot once. Uh, take off more clothes, please.\u201d He reached out and cupped her breasts in both hands, then leaned down and breathed on her nipples, and then kissed them. She nearly lost her footing; it felt like he was kissing her somewhere else entirely. She (gently) grabbed his ears and pulled him to her mouth and kissed him with the intensity she\u2019d felt, but tried to control, since he said, \u201cHero, hero.\u201d He didn\u2019t know her, then, and he said that. He knew the truth now, and he was still here.</p><p>She had no idea that simple acceptance could make her so wet.</p> <p>She wouldn\u2019t break the kiss, so they managed to undress and help each other without once coming up for air, and then she was carefully pushing him onto the soft grass and climbing on top of him. She\u2019d pushed him down on the bank and his head was actually pointing down toward the pond, but she didn\u2019t care if he didn\u2019t, and he didn\u2019t seem like he did. It was possible he\u2019d forgotten the park entirely.</p><p>Her knees were on either side of his hips and, while she steadied herself with one palm on his chest, she reached back and found his hot hard length. She squeezed gently and smiled at his groan, then lifted up just a bit and slooooowly lowered herself onto him, closing her eyes at the pure sweetness of it.</p><p>\u201cOh, Christ.\u201d</p><p>Yes, those were her exact sentiments.</p><p>She began to ride, getting used to him, letting him get used to her, easing up and down, surprised and thrilled at how slippery she was, how slippery he was making her.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t stop. Anything you want. If you don\u2019t stop. Money, fur, jewels. Farmland, puppies, caterpillars. Orange juice. A Starbucks franchise. A gift card for Red Lobster. Don\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>She leaned down and kissed him. \u201cI have no need for caterpillars and I hate lobster,\u201d she whispered into his mouth, and she felt him reach around and grip her ass. \u201cUmmm . . . that\u2019s nice. Do that harder. I\u2019m charged up enough . . . you can do that a lot harder.\u201d</p><p>So he clutched and kneaded her pale flesh until his knuckles whitened and the veins stood out on his neck, touching her with force that would have badly bruised anyone else, force that made her want only more of it, more of him. Watching him lose himself in her tipped her over and she fell into her orgasm; it hit her with such rapidity that she was surprised.</p><p>Still shuddering, she felt his warmth burst inside her and was surprised once again.</p><p>\u201cHailey,\u201d he managed after several minutes. \u201cI\u2019m officially ruined for other women, forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should hope so.\u201d She licked the sweat from his collarbone.</p> <p>\u201cAlso, I fell in love with you after you abandoned me at Big Bowl to help that mom free her kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd my head\u2019s gonna pop off.\u201d</p><p>She pulled back and looked; he was quite red-faced. \u201cOh, Linus! Your head was pointing down but I didn\u2019t think you cared at the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still don\u2019t care. I was just letting you know the situation. My head can keep filling with blood until I burst something; I don\u2019t give a shit. Won\u2019t even feel it. Won\u2019t notice . . . aaahhhhh.\u201d She\u2019d pulled him to a sitting position. \u201cSo, this is what it\u2019s like to not pass out.\u201d</p><p>She hugged him to her and heard an, \u201cOof!\u201d and then got a hug back. He grinned at her. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna have fun, aren\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the rest of our lives,\u201d she promised, and carried him to the car.</p><p>EPILOGUE</p> <p>\u201cHi. I\u2019m Audrey the Receptionist.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. First days were always the worst, but everyone had been pleasant so far. With the economy only starting to recover, he was grateful for a good job with a good company.</p><p>And Ramouette had of late been making quite a name for itself; it had always pulled a profit, which was a good trick given Minnesota\u2019s economic woes. But now it was making waves with its innovative benefits options, big number one being, \u201cAs long as your work is getting done, take all the vacation time you want.\u201d\u00a7 No one in the business world was quite sure what had changed in the last several months, and as someone whose first love was marketing, he\u2019d been anxious to join the team.</p><p>\u201cThis is Gerry, our new marketing director.\u201d The HR rep\u2014who insisted on referring to herself as one of Hailey\u2019s twisted minions and had never actually given him a name except Minion Number Four\u2014had been taking him around. He took that with an internal shrug: there was one in every company.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you,\u201d Gerry said, shaking her hand.</p><p>\u201cSame. Hailey\u2019s on her way,\u201d Audrey the Receptionist told the minion. Audrey was short, with ebony skin and a square-shaped face she emphasized with square glasses set in purple lenses. Her handshake was quick and firm. \u201cShe says she\u2019ll finish the new-hire stuff when she gets here. Hailey\u2019s our head of HR . . . She\u2019s running a little late.\u201d</p><p>Gerry said graciously, \u201cThat\u2019s how it goes sometimes. And Four-ninety-four was awful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s how it goes with Hailey sometimes, and by sometimes I mean always, and every day is Monday and Four-ninety-four is continually awful. Hey, Coot, what are you getting them for the engagement party?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe and Linus are getting married next spring,\u201d the young man\u2014who was surely not a day over thirty\u2014explained.</p><p>Did she call this boy Coot? All right: there were two in every company.</p><p>\u201cDid you say Linus?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Jamie Linus,\u201d Audrey the Receptionist replied. \u201cDon\u2019t call him Jamie because nobody will know who you\u2019re talking about, including him. He started here a few months ago . . . He\u2019s an accounting stud with the eyes of Marlon Brando and the freckles of Howdy Doody. Somehow he makes it work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarlon Brando, now there\u2019s a true Hollywood god. In my day\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, Coot. Gerry, don\u2019t pay any attention to his feeble mutterings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he replied cautiously. A transplant from New York, he\u2019d assumed midwesterners would be a little more bland.</p><p>Just then the front door opened and two more young people came in. The man had the most startling large brown eyes Gerry had ever seen, eyes that went oddly with (the receptionist had nailed it) the Howdy Doody freckles.</p><p>But it was the woman who caught most of his attention, and not just because she was a striking, slender brunette with a pretty mouth and lovely pale skin. She looked as though she\u2019d been in an accident\u2014torn panty hose, smudged skirt and blouse, hair straggling out of its ponytail.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d the coot and the receptionist said in perfect, unsurprised unison.</p><p>The woman greeted them with, \u201cSorry. Nasty one on the way in\u2014the cops were waiting for the firemen to grab the jaws of life. But it wasn\u2019t as bad as they thought. They were able to get the door off after all, jaw-less. You must be Gerry.\u201d She held out a small, dirty hand for him to shake.</p><p>\u201cYes, my God, are you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHailey likes to work out in garages, not gyms,\u201d Audrey the Receptionist explained as if that made sense to a normal person. \u201cShe feels that if you don\u2019t leave with oil in your hair and a torn shirt, you didn\u2019t do it right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to stop commuting with you,\u201d the freckled man groaned. \u201cYou\u2019ve made me late three times this week. And it\u2019s Tuesday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGerry, I\u2019ll just clean up and we can get to it,\u201d Hailey said, unperturbed by the comments. She was a lovely woman, glowing and proud even in her dishevelment. \u201cYou\u2019re going to like it here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure I will.\u201d All right, there are three in every company . . . no, four . . . Still, they seem like fun. Not much point going in to work if you don\u2019t like the people you work with. Nice kids, for sure.</p><p>\u201cWe all love it,\u201d she explained. \u201cA lot of companies say they are, but they aren\u2019t, not really. But Ramouette is.\u201d The woman seemed to almost glow with contentment and joy. \u201cWe\u2019re a family.\u201d</p><p>Undead and Underwater</p><p>PROLOGUE</p><p>She clawed for her cell phone, fumbled, dropped it, caught it with the tips of her fingers and then dropped it again. She fell to her knees on the concrete and scrabbled for it as scalding tears burned her cheeks. Thank God it hadn\u2019t been in her purse. Thank God she\u2019d kept it in her jacket pocket because her clutch was too small, thank God, thank God.</p><p>After a thousand years of groping for it in the far-from-perfect glow of street lights, she had it, and thumbed familiar buttons.</p><p>\u201cMama?\u201d she asked as the voice she loved answered her call, as she always, always did. And part of her was comforted, and part of her was rueful: I\u2019m in my early twenties, for God\u2019s sake, and, like, crying for my mommy? Laaaaame. \u201cMama, I\u2019m in such bad trouble. They\u2019re tried to kill me and they couldn\u2019t; they\u2019re gonna kill her and get back to me. And it\u2019s exactly what I deserve. She\u2019ll be dead because of me. And then I\u2019ll be dead because of me. I don\u2019t think you can fix it.\u201d</p><p>Her mother wasted no time. She soothed, she directed, she promised to fix it. All her daughter had to do was sit tight.</p><p>Soothed, Madison was surprised to see she was still on the concrete, her stockings in shreds around her knees and the darkened New England Aquarium looming behind her. Boston wasn\u2019t ever especially quiet, but at two A.M. on a Monday it was close.</p><p>She climbed to her feet, still looking at the building. Looming. Why did I think that? I work there, I always wanted to work there. Better, she used to work there, and prob\u2019ly will again. It was my favorite place in the world when I was ten and it is today and it\u2019s not looming, it\u2019s . . . it\u2019s just there.</p><p>The building hadn\u2019t changed. She had changed. Always wanting more and never satisfied, the Fehr family motto. She promised herself, as she had many times, that This Time It Would Be Different. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>(It was always the same.)</p><p>Forget the building: Mama was on the case.

She couldn\u2019t go home; they had her clutch, which meant they had her driver\u2019s license. They were welcome to the cash, and her credit cards would be cancelled within the next half hour. Mama was even now calling to book her a hotel room where she could\u2014</p><p>(cower)</p><p>\u2014lay low and\u2014</p><p>(creep away and cower)</p><p>\u2014stay off the radar for the next few hours.</p> <p>Whatever Mama did or whoever she sent, Madison would (finally) be her mother\u2019s daughter and have the courage to face it/them.

It hadn\u2019t for two days.</p><p>CHAPTER ONE</p><p>Fredrika Bimm, grumpy mermaid and former future queen of the Undersea Folk, stalked across the cobblestones past the Marriott Long Wharf, zeroing in on the pit of all evil and despair, the loathsome housing for malice that was the New England Aquarium. The sky was overcast, gray, and threatening to spit chilly rain. Her mood had never been so foul on a day she didn\u2019t have to go to a bridal/baby/housewarming/new pet shower. And that was foul indeed.</p><p>What has Fehr done? And why call me? If her former boss, Dr. Barb, hadn\u2019t been so insistent . . . but she had been, which sucked Jonas in, and then he got insistent . . . which meant she was in Boston, the very last place she wanted to be.</p><p>It was all that wedding stuff. Correction: weddings stuff. Plural. Bad enough she was Jonas\u2019s Bitch of Honor. But the other wedding was worse: her own. She was the bridezilla. (\u201cA bridezilla,\u201d Jonas had said, his voice faux trembling, \u201cto fear above all other bridezillas, a bridezilla the likes of which the world has never seen and pray God will never see again!\u201d It hadn\u2019t helped one bit that he\u2019d been right.)</p> <p>Ugh.</p><p>Tedious shopping trips spent tediously trying on tedious wedding finery. Tedious visits to florists and their tedious inventory. Bakeries: major, major tedium, not to mention sugar highs followed by sugar lows. Places that rented tedious tables and tedious tablecloths and tedious tuxes.</p><p>All that. Times two.</p><p>She was gnashing her teeth so hard she wondered if she\u2019d crack a molar. But that might not be a bad thing. An emergency trip to the dentist would get her out of all sorts of tediousness. Yes, an after-hours dental visit would solve so many problems. Fred cursed her never-so-much-as-a-cavity teeth. Why couldn\u2019t she have inherited her traitorous (dead) father\u2019s fangs? But noooo, she got her mom\u2019s flat grinders instead. Her father had been a predator in every sense of the word and, as with all his kind, went around with a mouth full of sewing needles; her mother was a gentle hippie whose idea of a naughty meal was putting store-bought ranch dressing on her (organic) salads. Fred got the hippie\u2019s teeth.</p><p>Fred sighed. Ah, it was all a simple daydream, but no matter how much she fantasized, a dentist in shining armor wasn\u2019t going to rescue her. And if one had, she\u2019d be so thrilled to have wiggled out of her responsibilities (if that\u2019s what they even were), she wouldn\u2019t have needed the nitrous oxide. She\u2019d giggle like a hyena while the dentist advanced on her with pliers or, worse, refused to validate her parking.</p><p>Gnashing her hippie grinders, Fred momentarily regretted she hadn\u2019t been lurking on the bottom of the Caspian Sea when Madison Fehr got up to her shenanigans du jour.</p><p>Whatever you\u2019ve done, Madison Fehr, whoever you\u2019re afraid of, you are absolutely afraid of The Wrong Person.</p><p>CHAPTER TWO</p> <p>It was strange that Fred noticed them at all. But she was a natural procrastinator, and often when she was trying to avoid a problem, she\u2019d let her attention get caught by just about anything.</p><p>It was a slow evening at the NEA; Tuesdays often were. School had let out, and it was the dinner hour, so all the buses full of children were long gone, as were the people who wanted to swing over to Faneuil Hall to suck down a lobster roll and/or cup of chowder and/or a brownie and/or fried rice for the trip home.</p><p>And because there weren\u2019t a hundred people milling about the entrance, her attention was caught by a tall dark-haired man who was standing perfectly still. That was unusual; Boston was lousy with people hurrying, always hurrying to get from Point A to Point Q (the roads did not go in straight lines, ever).</p><p>If I had access to a time machine, she mentally grouched for the hundredth time, I\u2019d go back and tell the FFs, \u201cGreat job finding the place, O mightily clever Founding Fathers, and, yes, I understand why you feel finders keepers is a legitimate reason for genocide and territorial conquest. I won\u2019t judge: it was a different time.</p><p>\u201cAnd thank you also for the Constitution: great job! Quite enlightened. And don\u2019t feel too bad about the parts you missed; later generations did eventually get around to acknowledging that freedom only for white men isn\u2019t exactly freedom. In fact, by definition, it\u2019s the opposite. Again: different time. Not judging.</p><p>\u201cBut perhaps deciding to pave the cow paths\u2014that is, paths trampled by bovines whose only concern was finding the tenderest of grass and alfalfa as opposed to the most efficient way to go from A to B\u2014was utterly, utterly stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201c. . . stupid.\u201d</p><p>She glanced over and saw him, a man who would have been striking under any circumstances. His sheer height, breadth of shoulders, and impeccably tailored navy suit demanded respectful attention. But what was odd was how he stood in the middle of the cement apron, arms stretched out and face tilted toward the (cloudy, sullen, threatening-to-rain) sky, smiling. Almost like he was . . . all right, it was silly, but she was a marine biologist, so she knew what a stranded mammal caught under open sky looked like. She was looking at a male Homo sapien, basking like a leopard seal, one decked out in a terrific suit about to snack on a dozen penguins.</p><p>(Later, when she knew what he was, she thought it was interesting that she would have instantly compared him to a predatory species; he and the woman were, in fact, apex predators.)</p><p>All that, still, might have escaped her notice\u2014or at least only captured her attention for a second\u2014but then the shrill woman said it again, echoing her thoughts: \u201cStupid!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSticks and stones, my love,\u201d the man replied in a cheerful baritone. He was turning in a slow circle while still staring at the sky, so blissed out she wondered if he was high on something. (She found out later he had been: high on the great outdoors, high on the color of the sky, high on how the air smelled before a spring rain, high on being in the company of his queen. Thus: no accounting for taste.)</p><p>\u201cSinclair!\u201d she cried in the tone of a woman annoyed beyond her capacity to bear such things, but the fond smile made her tone a lie. \u201cWill you please get a grip? Stop staring up and spinning around like friggin\u2019 Mary Tyler Moore on Nicollet Mall, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShush,\u201d he said, still basking, eyes still closed, arms still stretched out, still blissed out despite (because of? No . . . impossible) the shrill blonde. \u201cDo you know how long it has been since I was outside\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwenty minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014in a coastal city\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYear and a half ago, on the Cape with Marky Mark and the Fuzzy Bunch.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014during daylight? And you must promise never to call Michael that to his face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not promising anything, and okay, that thing about daylight, that\u2019s a fair point. Also: Who can turn the world on with his big weird smiiiiile? Who can take a sucky day, and suddenly make it all seem super lame?\u201d she sang, horribly off-key while (worse!) butchering the lyrics to the Mary Tyler Moore jingle. \u201cWell, it\u2019s you, Sink Lair, and you should know it! Each day you really, really blow it! Schmucks are all around and you\u2019re driving me crazy, stop spinning around like you\u2019re in a daze-ey . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re gonna stake it after all,\u201d was his (tuneful!) response, at which point the blonde shuddered and said the most puzzling thing yet: \u201cNo matter what I do to make things right, this timeline gets worse and worse.\u201d</p><p>Tourists, thought Fred, annoyed they\u2019d caught her interest for even a few seconds. Proof I\u2019d rather think about anything else except whatever mess Fehr\u2019s in. What\u2019s the actual line from the jingle? Ah: How will you make it on your own?</p><p>The man put his arms down and snapped his long fingers: crack! \u201cThe phone! I need to call them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, again?\u201d he replied easily, reaching into his suit jacket pocket to pull out an iPhone, sliding his fingers across it, then holding it to his ear. \u201cIt\u2019s been hours, long lonely hours, and I\u2014hello? Yes, may I speak with them? Yes, again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna drive the poor guy to suicide! Also again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me!\u201d the tall, handsome, dignified man said, in a tone that was not at all dignified. \u201cWho else would it be? I must speak to the babies. Put them on at once, Marc.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, God.\u201d The blonde sighed, shaking her head and staring at her shoes. Which were striking, Fred noticed. She herself had been known to wear flip-flops to a fund-raiser, but recognized beautiful foot gear when she saw it. These were high heels\u2014spike heels?\u2014with a black base, and beautiful bright flowers had been painted over them in vivid reds, greens, yellows.\u00b6</p><p>As the blonde began to pace, Fred saw she had no trouble walking in the teetery heels. They could have been last year\u2019s ratty tennis shoes, they seemed to fit her so well.</p><p>\u201c. . . yes, well, Elizabeth is on her way to meet the young lady in question, and I have more shopping to do for the babies. So would you please put Fur on for Daddy. And then Burr. And then both!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCannot believe, cannot believe you\u2019re turning into one of those guys, Sinclair. I might not ever save you again if you keep this up.\u201d</p><p>\u201c. . . that\u2019s all right; I shall wait . . . Hello? Marc?\u201d He glanced at his companion, who was rubbing her temples. \u201cAre you having trouble hearing me . . . ? Perhaps this is a poor area for . . . Hello? Marc?\u201d He began shouting into the phone. Perhaps Marc was trapped in a blizzard with a dying cell. \u201cTell my babies Daddy is calling and I have bought them all kinds of snacks and shall buy still more! Fish snacks! From Boston!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Argh, enough. She could stare at the tourists all day; it wouldn\u2019t make Fehr go away, it would only make everything take longer.</p><p>Her phone buzzed and she pulled it, glanced at it, then texted Jonas back: CAN\u2019T SEE YOU NOW BUSY MAYBE LATER. Sure, like that would have any effect.</p><p>She pulled her badge and her key card, and headed to one of the side entrances for employees. Not that she was one. But being a mermaid who used to work for the NEA had its advantages: pretty much every aquarium in the world wanted her to have drop-in privileges. Her old boss, Dr. Barb, had given her an ID and the keys to the castle more or less in perpetuity.</p> <p>Fred didn\u2019t give the tourists another thought until she found herself trying to push the blonde\u2019s nose out through the back of her head.</p><p>Tuesdays! Sheesh.</p><p>CHAPTER THREE</p><p>Betsy Taylor, vampire queen and exasperated wife, noticed the lanky, frowning redhead at once. There weren\u2019t many people around, for one thing, and her husband, Eric Sinclair, had gone insane; that was the other thing. Betsy was, therefore, interested in anything that did not involve acknowledging her husband\u2019s recent insanity. Thus, the redhead, who seemed in a hurry yet was dithering outside the Big Boston Aquarium or whatever the heck it was called, caught her eye.</p><p>Leaving her insane husband to go about his insane business, Betsy followed the redhead, who looked to be in her midtwenties and was dressed in a torn T-shirt (not artfully torn, torn torn, as in, it was old and ratty and the fabric had given way due to wear and tear, as opposed to tear and tear), a pair of paint-spattered jeans (also torn torn), and (shudder!) pastel blue flip-flops. None of which Betsy much cared about; besides, you couldn\u2019t make people care about their shoes. The accessories she appreciated were the employee ID around the redhead\u2019s neck and, presumably, the key card to go with it. She was too old to be an intern, and wasn\u2019t dressed like someone in corporate, but the fact that she was here after hours with ID was promising.</p> <p>You picked a bad day to linger, Red. And a . . . yeesh! A bad day to skip a shower. Do all the employees smell like that?</p><p>As the redhead started to let herself into a side entrance, Betsy walked straight up to her, tapped her on the shoulder (literally speaking), and then seized her brain (figuratively speaking). \u201cTake me inside, please. Right now, no questions.\u201d Please had been unnecessary; the redhead had no choice. Still, Betsy hadn\u2019t been raised by wolves. At least, not entirely. Though she\u2019d been known to hang out with them now and again.</p><p>And in they went.</p><p>The first thing that struck her was the immense size of the place; the outside building had been whopping but still hadn\u2019t come close to showcasing how the aquarium was essentially a gigantic warehouse on the bay filled with all things fishy.</p><p>The second thing that struck her was fishy: the odor. It wasn\u2019t awful, but it was pretty constant . . . it was how the woman smelled, but concentrated. She knew her brain would adjust and eventually tell her nose it didn\u2019t smell like much at all in there. Get to work, brain, start lying through my teeth! Or whatever you need to do in there to fool my nose.</p><p>The third was the sense of desertion. The place was a tomb\u2014literally; there were fish skeletons all over, and the size of the place emphasized how empty it was. Betsy stifled the urge to shout, \u201cHelloooooooo\u201d for the childish pleasure of hearing the echo.</p> <p>All in all: excellent! Maybe this little cross-country errand wouldn\u2019t take long. Maybe she and her insane husband could be back on the plane tomorrow morning, where he could cheerfully continue his insanity at thirty thousand feet. When his insanity ran its course, as she prayed it must, she, too, would be insane, and all their friends. But they\u2019d be insane together! One great big happy family of utter nut balls.</p><p>She fished out her cell and double-checked the info. Madison Fehr, former intern at the aquarium. In some kind of trouble, the kind where a coroner had to be called and police reports filed. Madison\u2019s mother had pulled a Princess Leia: Help me, Obi-Betsy. You\u2019re my only hope. And so here she was.</p><p>\u201cDo you know Madison Fehr?\u201d she asked the redhead, who was staring ahead like one of those creepy stuffed animals that could walk or bark or turn a somersault, but did nothing but stand and stare after the batteries ran down. \u201cIs she here?\u201d</p><p>The redhead grimaced . . . a good trick, since most people she mojo\u2019d behaved like robots she alone could command. No expression, no input of their own. Just blind, unquestioning obedience. \u201cYes,\u201d she replied, the ugh plain to hear in her voice. \u201cAnd, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, take me to wherever she\u2019d be in this cement cavern. Can you do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. And, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen giddyap, Red.\u201d</p><p>The redhead actually turned around and met Betsy\u2019s gaze, which no one mojo\u2019d had ever done. She gave Betsy a look that clearly conveyed what she thought of the instructions, then slooooowly obeyed.</p> <p>I must be losing my touch! Or she\u2019s a special case. People either instantly submitted to her hostile takeover of their brain, or fought like pissed cats. Or it didn\u2019t work with them at all. Not this . . . this eventual, sullen obedience. Betsy was less than five years dead; she had no idea what to do but plow ahead. Some people have a higher tolerance for booze, some for drugs, some for ye olde look-into-my-eyes vampire mojo. Live and learn! Or if you can\u2019t do both, try for just one. And I know which one I\u2019d try for . . .</p><p>She followed the redhead through the semi-gloom, trying not to be distracted by the exhibits of shiny fish, lobsters, and jellyfish. She was surprised to discover that parts of the Aquarium were more like classrooms and research labs\u2014she\u2019d figured the whole fishy warehouse to be one big tourist trap. See the penguins, learn about them, then buy a stuffed one for the low, low price of $49.99.</p><p>But, no, people apparently did serious work here as well as hosing down seals, cleaning up the IMAX theater, and selling things no one needed at outrageous markups. Did you have to get a master\u2019s degree in marine biology or fish zoology or whatever before you could say, \u201cTicket, please\u201d?</p><p>One of the labs opened into a sort of kitchen area/staff break room, and it was down there that she got a look at Madison Fehr for the first time. She hadn\u2019t been able to smell her; all she could smell were smelt. Or whatever they fed the seals and sharks and rays and clownfish.</p><p>Well, she\u2019ll be relieved to see I\u2019m here, was Betsy\u2019s last thought before Madison started screaming and the redhead punched her so hard she flew out of her shoes.</p><p>Her shoes!</p><p>CHAPTER FOUR</p><p>The girl\u2019s shrieks jolted Fred out of her stupor, and she\u2019d never been so glad in her life that Madison had a low stress threshold. Even as Fred let herself be taken by the adrenaline rush, she could feel that other woman\u2019s hold on her thoughts slacken dramatically and, the more she moved and thought on her own, disappear entirely. Even her physical touch had been startling and unreal: the woman felt uncommonly cool, like she had Freon instead of blood running through her veins. It was a relief to be away from her in every way.</p><p>Hitting someone had never felt so satisfying. Not even when she had killed her father. \u201cDon\u2019t you ever,\u201d she told her as the blonde sailed over the small break room table, \u201cdon\u2019t you ever\u201d\u2014and crashed into the wall just behind it\u2014\u201cdon\u2019t you ever, ever do that to me again!\u201d</p><p>Although the woman landed in a heap, that did not allay Fred\u2019s rage and fear. So she rushed over, picked her up with both hands by her (rapidly ripping) collar, and slammed her back down on her brain-hijacking blond butt.</p><p>\u201cIf you ever\u2014\u201d Slam! \u201cIf you ever!\u201d Wham! \u201cI will kill you. Not you-borrowed-my-shirt-without-asking-I\u2019m-gonna-kill-you kill you. The-minute-you\u2019ve-finished-throwing-up-you\u2019ve-gotta-call-the-cops-or-we\u2019ll-never-get-those-dogs-away-from-the-corpse kill you.\u201d</p><p>She took a breath and kept on: \u201cThe police. The police will make slideshows out of what I do to you.\u201d She seized the treacherous twat to go for one more wall toss, only to have the blonde catch her by the wrists and gently but firmly thrust her back, a good trick from her position flat on the floor: no leverage. Fred flailed a little but didn\u2019t fall. She was again aware of the coolness of the woman\u2019s hands. They\u2019re cold enough to be a doctor\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cAll right, those I deserved, but now you\u2019re getting a little foamy at the mouth, and getting beaten to death is gonna wreck my week, so just . . . settle. Okay?\u201d</p><p>Anyone else would be out. Anyone else would have an urgent date with an ER attending. She took it and then she stopped it, and neither act appeared to take much toll. I am in real trouble here.</p><p>\u201cDr. Bimm . . . ohmiGod . . . And you . . . You\u2019re here, too . . . Aw, jeez . . .\u201d</p><p>Fred had forgotten about Madison, the screaming witness to the beat down. Gad, the poor thing must be scared out of her tiny mind.</p><p>Fred took a breath and puffed a lock of hair out of her eyes. She\u2019d torn her shirt again. A pity it hadn\u2019t been the woman\u2019s face. \u201cOkay, Madison, it\u2019s all right. You were right to call me.\u201d Never would she admit how that confession stung like acid. \u201cShe\u2019s down, okay? Madison, look.\u201d Fred actually grasped her (heaving) shoulders and turned her twenty-five degrees to the left, the better to see the mysterious blonde who was, incredibly, trying to stand. \u201cI got her.\u201d</p><p>Or not. But she must know\u2014her ass is still on the floor, she\u2019d better know\u2014I\u2019ll put her through the wall, not just into the wall, if she tries even one more thing.</p><p>Though having her brain kidnapped had been horrifying, Fred wasn\u2019t going to deny being surprised and happy. Surprised because she\u2019d gained new respect for Madison . . . If this woman was after her, her former intern had a serious problem indeed.</p><p>Even better, Madison\u2019s problem wasn\u2019t going to take weeks of her time, or even days. Hell, twelve hours from now she could be snuggling into bed with her fianc\u00e9, Thomas. Twelve? Nonsense . . . the Marriott Long Wharf was all of five hundred yards away. Room service sundaes while she and Thomas did their best to make sure they\u2019d get hot fudge stuck in wonderful places . . . a date to remember. She hadn\u2019t seen him in weeks, and they\u2019d barely had time to get their shirts off before Madison had called in tears . . . </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But that was then and, as Fred had just realized, Madison had done the right thing. Fred would never admit it aloud, but she was ashamed of (some of) the unkind things she\u2019d thought and said about Madison. If I hadn\u2019t been here\u2014if that rotten bitch hadn\u2019t kidnapped my brain and used me to get into the building\u2014Madison could be dead.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Fred assured Madison again, and the blonde on the floor said the same thing at nearly the same time.</p><p>And, \u201cI got your message; I came to help.\u201d They both said that, too, and then broke off and glared at each other.</p> <p>Finally: \u201cI\u2019m here now, everything\u2019s all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you please stop reading my lines?\u201d The other woman had gotten to her feet, something Fred found amazing and ominous, and was gingerly feeling her face and neck and head. \u201cOkay, so . . . okay, that\u2019s still there . . . and there\u2019s no hole there . . . so my skull only feels like a ceramic pot you chucked out a window. And ow. And ow. Ow-ow-ow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgain, Red, you\u2019re reading my lines, not yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike hell,\u201d Fred snapped back. \u201cYou should know, with every word that drops from your insipid mouth, I get more and more pissed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019d think that would shut me up. And yet here I am. Still talking.\u201d</p><p>Yes, that was annoying. \u201cWhoever you are, you picked the wrong dolphin-loving ex-intern to mess with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m guessing you\u2019re not talking about yourself.\u201d She pointed to a wide-eyed Madison. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not messing with her. You are.\u201d</p><p>Fred shook her head so hard she almost knocked herself over. Listening to the nonsense made her feel like she was on shaky ground, like her brain was vulnerable and this close to being hijacked again. Being under the blonde\u2019s control had been like trying to think through a brain drowning in quicksand. Just remembering how it felt to have a voice that was not her own controlling her nervous system made Fred want to vomit up her lungs.</p><p>\u201cThis,\u201d the blonde was saying, limping to one of her pretty shoes and stuffing it back on her foot, \u201cthis is what I get for answering the phone. And listening to what the person on the other end says. And then agreeing to act. And then acting by coming to Boston with my insane\u2014never mind. The point is, I\u2019ve brought it on myself. Ow. Anybody ever tell you, you hit like someone wearing brass knuckles over their brass knuckles?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Oddly, that pleased her. \u201cHow are you even conscious?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a secret. So I\u2019ll just tell you: I\u2019ve got a hard head. Like, concrete hard. Cement hard. Trying-to-get-Sarah-McLachlan-to-stop-making-those-sad-animal-abuse-commercials hard. Also you smell weird, does that have anything to do with it?\u201d</p><p>Fred wondered if a side effect of being possessed was to feel like nothing anyone said made sense for at least ten minutes afterward. \u201cDoes that have anything to do with what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe badass beat down you just gave me. And I couldn\u2019t mojo you.\u201d The woman was looking at her thoughtfully and, though she wasn\u2019t behaving in a threatening manner, Fred sensed she was more dangerous now than she\u2019d been before. \u201cNot all the way, anyway. You shrugged it off after a while. That\u2019s never . . . huh. Why do you smell like fish?\u201d</p><p>Fred blinked. This was . . . yes. This was happening. \u201cYou\u2019re in an aquarium, you idiot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTouch-ee. Betsy Taylor, by the way.\u201d She stuck out her hand.</p><p>Fred looked down at it, then back up into Betsy\u2019s blue green eyes. Then remembered mojo and jerked her gaze elsewhere. \u201cI\u2019m not shaking your hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOuch again. It\u2019s okay; they warned me about people from Boston.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not\u2014\u201d Fred shut her mouth. Why am I having a conversation with this creature? My kingdom for a spear gun.</p> <p>Undeterred, the woman continued, \u201cI\u2019m Betsy Taylor. You must be Madison Fehr. We got here as soon as we could. Sorry if I scared you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay.\u201d Madison was hiccupping, from fear or adrenaline or both, but got hold of herself enough to shake Betsy\u2019s hand. \u201cI didn\u2019t handle that very well. I haven\u2019t handled any of this very well. I\u2019m rilly, rilly sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I was hoping we could talk about that. And about you, of course. I take it that whatever jam you\u2019re in, she\u2019s not part of it?\u201d Jerking a thumb in Fred\u2019s direction.</p><p>Madison, still hiccupping, shook her head. \u201cNo. Not yet, but she probably will be, and it\u2019s my fault.\u201d For the first time, Fred saw how wretched Madison looked and sounded. The girl was barely out of college, had the money to buy anything she liked, and usually looked carefully put together.</p><p>Madison tended to dress like she still went to an exclusive East Coast private school: pleated khaki skorts, crisp white blouses, navy cardigans, and her I\u2019m-only-an-intern-but-they-gave-me-this-cool-lab-coat lab coat. Hair pulled back into a curly platinum ponytail. Minimum-to-no makeup . . . the only thing she and Fred had in common. Madison didn\u2019t need it, and Fred had always found stuffing her pores with foundation, tugging on the delicate skin around her eyes with pencils and makeup brushes, and plastering her lips with wax preservatives to be exquisitely stupid.</p><p>That other one was wearing makeup: bronzer and blush. She didn\u2019t need it, either, which pissed Fred off. Irrational and irrelevant, but tonight she was a slave to her baser emotions.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t suppose either of you are in a smoothie mood, huh?\u201d Betsy asked.</p><p>CHAPTER FIVE</p><p>\u201cIf neither of us is the problem, what\u2019s the problem?\u201d</p><p>Madison was having trouble meeting either woman\u2019s gaze. \u201cUm, I\u2019m the problem. Me and the bad guys. Okay, these guys I met? They think I\u2019m Fred? And they wanna kill lots of Undersea Folk?\u201d</p><p>As Fred stared, Betsy\u2014sounding truly unpleasant for the first time\u2014said, \u201cI hate when women make everything a question? I don\u2019t understand how you can\u2019t hear how annoying that sounds? Like you can\u2019t get your thumb out of your butt and be assertive?\u201d</p><p>Fred snorted; her sentiments exactly. She hadn\u2019t anticipated having even one thing in common with Betsy Taylor.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, the bad guys think you\u2019re me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd who are you?\u201d Betsy asked.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do that.\u201d The only thing that made Fred more uncomfortable than the people who recognized her were the ones who pretended they didn\u2019t recognize her. \u201cIf you\u2019ve ever watched TV or been on the Web, you know who I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow, the ego on you. And if I\u2019m calling you on having a big ego, it\u2019s time to reexamine your life. Let\u2019s try one more time: Who are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is my work friend,\u201d Madison lied. Fred did not consider the platinum-haired dimwit a friend. But this is my pain in the ass sounded unkind, even to her ears. \u201cBetsy, this is Dr. Fredrika Bimm. She\u2019s one of those mermaid people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy mermaid people do you mean heavily medicated people?\u201d</p><p>Fred slapped the counter in her annoyance. \u201cOh, come on! It\u2019s been all over the news for months. Mermaids are real, they\u2019re called Undersea Folk, and we\u2019re all going try to live in peace. Hum your favorite parts from \u2018Come Together\u2019 and it\u2019ll all fall into place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been busy with my own stuff\u2014does this sound familiar since I just said it? So how about you get to the actual reason we\u2019re all in a big fish warehouse on a Tuesday night after the place is closed when I could be around the corner enjoying an oyster milkshake at the\u2014the\u201d\u2014Betsy held up one finger in the universal hold-on-a-second gesture, fumbled through her dark green tote bag, then whipped out Boston For Dummies\u2014\u201cUnion Oyster House. Says here it\u2019s the oldest tavern in America.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou called a tourist for help?\u201d Fred asked Madison, who had the decency to blush at the shame of it. \u201cAnd you! Step away from the guidebook. First, you should have gone with Rough Guides. They\u2019re not as bossy. Second, mermaids exist, I\u2019m one of them, and that\u2019s probably why Madison\u2019s in trouble. I have to speculate, though, since Madison hasn\u2019t coughed up the reason she\u2019s in trouble. As for you . . .\u201d Fred seized Betsy by the arm and hauled her up the stairs . . . and up, and up. Madison tripped along behind them, wringing her hands. Fred was unaware women did that outside of gothic novels. \u201cI can see we\u2019re gonna be stuck in neutral unless I can get you past this one thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean about you being clinically insane? It\u2019s okay, though,\u201d she added hastily as they came to the top level, and the top of the tank. \u201cMy husband is, too, so I\u2019m not judging. What does any of what you\u2019re doing have to do with\u2014Hey, a turtle!\u201d She peered into the enormous tank, home to several dozen species of fish and reptiles. \u201cAnd sharks!\u201d Then: \u201cWhoa.\u201d</p><p>She had whoa\u2019d because Fred had kicked off her flip-flops and stripped down to her . . . nothing. Yep, she was down to her nothing. Then she stomped over to the stairs beside the side of the tank, ascended them, and\u2014</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019ll need a note from a parent or a doctor before you do that. Seriously. Will you get down? Hey\u2014don\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>\u2014dropped in.</p><p>The NEA\u2019s Giant Ocean Tank** was a four-story live exhibit at the heart of the aquarium. More than twenty feet deep and over thirty feet wide, the thing held two hundred thousand gallons of salt water as well as turtles, stingrays, eels, reef fish, sharks, assorted excrement from same, discarded food from same, coral reefs\u2014lots o\u2019 stuff, in other words. The water itself was bathtub warm.</p><p>From inside, Fred could see wavy, indistinct versions of Betsy and Madison looking down at her. She was a little nervous. Not out of fear of the tank\u2019s inhabitants. Like all Undersea Folk, Fred shared a low, telepathy-based form of communication with the fish here, and they were (for the most part) on friendly terms. Yes, they\u2019d gone on a hunger strike a couple of years ago when Fred refused to pipe in more Pet Shop Boys (coral reef fish adored \u201980s glam rock for reasons unknown to Fred, who loathed it). Yes, there were occasional power struggles. But in general they got along. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>No, she was afraid of how the other two would react. Though she had outed herself as a mermaid-human hybrid to the world, she was still overcoming decades of conditioning to keep her deep dark secret a deep dark secret.</p><p>Speaking of which, time for the show, especially since she couldn\u2019t swim without her tail, which made snorkeling a challenge: she stretched, wiggled in place, and felt her legs recede and her tail come forth. Not that her legs went anywhere, or her tail came from anywhere. It was difficult to describe the process, which she\u2019d found personally frustrating as someone with a background in biology. It was like her legs were . . . subsumed, she supposed. Like getting a tan: the tanned person looked different, but they were still the same person. Even when she couldn\u2019t see her legs, she knew they were there, knew they were a part of her.</p><p>She swam back and forth for a minute, letting Betsy get a good look and glad for a chance to work out some muscle tension. Then with a powerful flick, she zoomed up to the top, her head popping out with a satisfying splash.</p> <p>Betsy was clutching the top of the tank, white-faced. \u201cOh my God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see you\u2019ve grasped the situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is what I was talking about.\u201d Fred made sure she was within reach of the ladder before shifting back to her legs and climbing out. \u201cSomehow you\u2019ve missed the fact that an entirely new sentient species has existed with yours for millennia and picked the last six months to expose themselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll say,\u201d she muttered, eyeing Fred as she gathered up her clothes. \u201cNice rack, by the way. Unreal! Not your rack. The situation.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOnly to some.\u201d But she smiled to soften her comment, then wondered why she wanted to soften anything for the tote-bag-toting, nonsense-spouting, thought-hijacking bitch.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe it!\u201d</p><p>Betsy seemed so astonished, and so sympathetic (though that was a little weird\u2014why would she have sympathy?), Fred found herself warming up to her.</p><p>\u201cYou sometimes have a tail? You\u2019re a half mermaid thingy or whatever so sometimes your feet just disappear?\u201d Betsy sounded more distressed now than when Fred was tossing her into break room walls. \u201cSo half the time you can\u2019t wear shoes! Half the time you can\u2019t wear shoes! Even\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014if when, even if when you have feet and buy the cutest pair ever, sometimes your feet just vanish!\u201d She staggered and, startled, Fred put out a hand to steady the tall blonde. \u201cI\u2019m so, so sorry!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that bad.\u201d Was she serious?</p><p>\u201cNo, just\u2014I don\u2019t mean to\u2014you\u2019re very brave. I could never be as brave as you with this; I\u2019d take it much harder. I don\u2019t know what to say. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>She was! Why am I surprised Madison asked an idiot for help? Fred went to the secret towel cache she tucked beside the exit, briskly dried herself, then started putting her clothes back on. \u201cAnyway. Per Madison, here, somebody tried to kill her because they thought she was me. Is that right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the condensed version, yeah.\u201d Again, Madison stared at the floor. Fred didn\u2019t know if she was glad the girl had no comment about what she\u2019d just seen, or miffed. You\u2019d think someone who rilly, rilly loved dolphins would be just a teeny bit blown away by seeing a real mermaid in the flesh, so to speak. \u201cThe long version makes me out to be pretty stupid.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m sure. \u201cSo now that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to tell my husband about this!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you like, but right now we have to deal with\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa, okay? Whoa, whoa. I\u2019m gonna need more than thirty seconds to process what you just did.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve had months, like everyone else,\u201d Fred forced out through gritted teeth. \u201cUnless you\u2019ve been off the planet, there\u2019s no excuse for\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish it was as simple as being off planet. You know? I absolutely wish I\u2019d been only off planet, fighting space lizards or feeling Khan\u2019s wrath or whatever, so instead of someone yowling, \u2018Khaaaaaan! Khaaaaan!\u2019 they\u2019d be all, \u2018Betseeeeey! Betseeeeey!\u2019 But I was time traveling and in hell and getting my friend Jessica pregnant and things just sort of stacked up on me. And big damn deal! I don\u2019t have to justify my to-do list to you. Great, you\u2019re a fish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPart fish. No, dammit, no fish, I\u2019m a mammal!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, a mammal with fish scales. Is that why you were able to shrug off my mojo, and smell weird?\u201d</p><p>Remembering her desperate battle to think her own thoughts, Fred muttered, \u201cShrug off isn\u2019t how I\u2019d have described that. And I do not smell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you smell, either, Dr. Bimm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d Betsy soothed. \u201cDon\u2019t take it wrong. It\u2019s not a bad smell. It\u2019s just different. It\u2019s not your fault\u2014I\u2019ve got a super sensitive nose. And I\u2019m still learning, so at first I thought it was just me, but now I know it\u2019s just you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Nothing. Nothing this woman babbled made sense, ever.</p><p>\u201cOkay, this is a terrible example, but I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll help so that you\u2019ll be able to overlook the terribleness of it: You know how when you walk into a good sushi restaurant, you smell fish? And it\u2019s not a bad smell, but it\u2019s a smell? You\u2019re the sushi restaurant of my . . . er . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cOlfactory canyon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! That! But again, not in a gross or smelly way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dislike you intensely,\u201d Fred said. She\u2019d had enough of the blonde, enough of the other blonde, enough of the tank, and enough of the entire mess, which still had not been explained to her satisfaction. \u201cDid you mean it about wanting a smoothie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Betsy\u2019s face lit up and Fred was startled at how quickly she could go from pretty to gorgeous. \u201cYou\u2019re not teasing, right? Because if you are, that\u2019s just not funny. So are you? No? We can? Smoothies? Now?\u201d She threw her arms around her, which Fred found alarming and touching. A little touching. Barely touching. Not really touching at all.</p><p>She figured the woman had a lot of friends. Probably she made positive first impressions on others, ones who didn\u2019t mind her penchant for thought rape. She could see how Betsy could grow on her. Like a fungus. Like . . . blonde athlete\u2019s foot.</p><p>So I\u2019d better work doubly hard not to let her in me or let her win me over.</p><p>Thus resolved, Fred explained how easy it would be to score smoothies in Boston on a Tuesday night.</p><p>CHAPTER SIX</p><p>\u201cWhoa.\u201d</p><p>She must say that a lot, Fred concluded, though she was pleased to see Betsy enjoying the marketplace. The scents, sights, and lights were dazzling to Fred, and she\u2019d lived in the area most of her life. What must it be like for . . . er . . . for someone who was from . . . uh . . .</p><p>Fred realized that she still knew nothing about Betsy except she could hijack brains and didn\u2019t need to wear makeup. So that would have to be rectified while they ate.</p><p>\u201cIt used to be a meeting hall in the seventeen hundreds,\u201d Fred explained, finding herself in tour-guide mode but not minding. She loved Boston. It was a city that looked old but felt young. \u201cNo taxation without representation was debated right here. Samuel Adams and George Washington were both here to pitch their cases. Ted Kennedy and Bill Clinton have been here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat, but it\u2019s weird you\u2019re counting those last two as a mark in this place\u2019s favor. Whoever\u2019s been here, it\u2019s great. Look at all the food to choose from!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd all thanks to the cradle of liberty. You\u2019re welcome, the rest of America.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had no idea the Founding Fathers invented smoothies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course they di\u2014\u201d She glanced at the blonde, who grinned back. \u201cAh. Very funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well. Couldn\u2019t resist messing with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry harder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis . . . is . . . so . . . cool!\u201d During their conversation Betsy took in everything she could. She was walking while staring, looking all around and even up at times; it was amazing that she hadn\u2019t stepped on someone or knocked them over. \u201cWhat are you guys gonna get? Can we eat inside? It\u2019s cold out. Where should we sit?\u201d</p><p>Not that cold. Most people are so happy when spring shows up, they\u2019ll sit outside in a thirty-degree drizzle. Hmm.</p><p>Fred, obeying the demands of her shellfish allergy, opted for a salad. Madison had a daiquiri; Betsy opted for a strawberry smoothie. \u201cIt\u2019s so fresh,\u201d she moaned around the straw. \u201cTastes like they picked \u2019em this morning. I live near farms\u2014I married a former farmer\u2014and this is still the best one I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, fascinating. Glad you like it, now let\u2019s get to it.\u201d I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m here, but it\u2019s not to be her tour guide. They had picked a (relatively) private table on the second floor, in the far corner (if a round room could be said to have corners). As it was past the dinner hour, they had most of the tables to themselves. \u201cYou said you live near farms? Where are you from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSt. Paul. Which, you\u2019re gonna point out, is a big city and farm-free, and it is, but it\u2019s not farmer\u2019s market free, and that\u2019s where we get a lot of our fruit.\u201d</p><p>Fred looked at Madison. \u201cYou dragged whoever she is out here from Minnesota?\u201d</p><p>Madison looked uncomfortable but, to her credit, managed a truthful answer. \u201cI didn\u2019t drag anybody anywhere. I was hoping for help, though. I don\u2019t want to lie about that.\u201d</p><p>Fred turned back to Betsy. \u201cHow do you even know Madison?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t. I don\u2019t know her mom, either, but her mom knows me, so here I am.\u201d</p><p>Her hip buzzed; Fred ignored it. \u201cLet\u2019s try this again. From the beginning. What\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMadison\u2019s mom called me,\u201d Betsy said between slurps. \u201cSaid her kid was in trouble and would I please go see what I could do, and my husband is going insane so I figured a change of scenery might help, and here I am drinking the best smoothie of my life after meeting a grouchy mermaid.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Fred took that in, then turned to Madison. \u201cYou ready to jump in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCareful,\u201d Betsy cautioned. \u201cShe might mean that literally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI called you and then my mom, and she called Betsy, and here I am and here you guys are.\u201d Madison lowered her voice, though no one seemed to be paying attention to them. \u201cI didn\u2019t think Betsy would get here so fast.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I do. Get places fast. D\u2019you think they\u2019d make me a custom smoothie if I said pretty please? I\u2019m thinking peach and raspberry . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you two being obtuse on purpose?\u201d Fred demanded.</p><p>\u201cMmmm . . .\u201d She appeared to think about it as she licked her straw. \u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so . . .\u201d Madison said doubtfully.</p><p>\u201cAre you trying to goad me into beating you to death? Because you should know it\u2019s not difficult to goad me into beating you to death.\u201d</p> <p>Madison sighed. \u201cI met this great guy\u2014I thought he was great\u2014and a couple of his friends at the NEA, and they thought I was you and that was okay when they were just being touristy, but they want to kill you, Fred, and when they found out I wasn\u2019t you, they tried to kill me. I got away and called Fred and my mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you called your mom because . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe can always fix things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your mom called Betsy because . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetsy\u2019s the queen of the vampires.\u201d Madison waited, as if that was a normal thing for a normal person to say. Then she stirred, as if remembering something: \u201cOh! My mom\u2019s a vampire, too. Did I forget that part?\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER SEVEN</p> <p>Fred took a breath. Held it for a count of ten. Gave up at five, whooshed, then said, \u201cLet\u2019s take it from the top.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgain, she might mean that literally. She gets off on stripping naked and then jumping into things. So just, you know, be aware.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mom is a vampire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Betsy is also a vampire; she\u2019s the queen of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. I can see why you wouldn\u2019t want that to be gossip fodder. What I don\u2019t understand is\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, wait.\u201d Betsy had put her straw aside, upended her near-empty glass over her open mouth, and was now thumping the bottom of the glass to get the last precious drops of the smoothie. \u201cThat\u2019s it? You\u2019re taking that in stride? You don\u2019t want to take five and have a minor freak-out?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. I believe you both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause, there being mermaids? Doesn\u2019t prove that there are vampires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t disprove it, either.\u201d The strength. The way she took a beating that might have killed a regular person. The thirst. The . . . What did she call it? The mojo? Those also helped prove her point. \u201cOkay. So your mother, who is a vampire, called the qu\u2014the quee\u2014\u201d The vampire part was believable . . . or at least, not unbelievable. The queen part was harder. This woman was a leader? People looked to her for guidance? The horror. So she veered off topic for a few seconds. \u201cHow is it that your mom\u2019s a vampire? You\u2019re adopted, right?\u201d</p><p>Madison nodded and stirred her daiquiri, which she had barely touched. \u201cYeah. Mom\u2019s raised lots of kids. She left England a while back to get away from the douche boat she married. She\u2014\u201d</p><p>Fred knew she shouldn\u2019t, but did anyway: \u201cDouche boat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCross between a douche bag and a dreamboat. Like Bradley Cooper in the Wedding Crashers. I think I read that in EW.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Madison nodded. \u201cMom wanted kids, but not his kids. And once she came to America and settled in and got established and died and came back, she started taking in orphans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefine a while back.\u201d Old money, that\u2019s what Dr. Barb had told Fred several months ago. Interns were sometimes a burden, sometimes a blessing; the coin flipped and you got what you got. Madison wasn\u2019t the first intern Fred had to put up with because Someone Important got her the slot. Fred had been expected to play nice with the Fehr-haired girl because her mother was rich and a generous sponsor of the NEA. So old money could mean\u2014</p><p>\u201cYou know how people say so-and-so\u2019s been here so long, their family came over on the Mayflower?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Betsy answered. \u201cExcept in Minnesota, we say they\u2019re so old they were the original Ole and Lena.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. My mother really did come over on the Mayflower.\u201d</p><p>Fred just stared.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh, rilly, I\u2019m serious! A long time ago, hundreds of years, a small group of disgruntled English citizens decided to head forth to a new land in the hopes of\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand that.\u201d The last thing I need is a history lesson from Madison Fehr. \u201cThat must be\u2014Your mom must have some good stories.\u201d</p><p>Madison sighed. \u201cYou\u2019d think. But, no. At least none she\u2019ll share. I get a lot of you\u2019ve got no idea how good you\u2019ve got it, but all moms do that. It\u2019s, like, a mom rule. So my mom knew about Betsy.\u201d To Betsy: \u201cShe gets the newsletter, so she had all your contact info.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Madison ignored Fred\u2019s squawk. \u201cAnd I told her I was in a jam, and she sent Betsy here to help me.\u201d</p><p>Betsy smiled. \u201cNot quite right, since there\u2019s not a vampire on the planet who can send me anywhere.\u201d She said so in a perfectly pleasant tone. So why, Fred wondered, staring at her, did all the saliva in my mouth just dry up?</p><p>Madison had caught it, too; the whites of her eyes were showing all the way around, like a horse about to rear. Between one second and the next, the room seemed darker and colder; between one breath and the next, the world was scarier. Because Betsy had spoken one sentence. And smiled as she did it. Fred had felt that sort of indifferent menace before: from hammerhead sharks.</p><p>\u201cI mean\u2014I mean, then you agreed. When you heard my mom needed you. That I needed you. When she told you\u2014when she asked you and you agreed to come. But you didn\u2019t have to. Because no vampires can send you. You came because you wanted to. Out here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s not like I can\u2019t watch my TV shows online,\u201d Betsy replied, instantly back to herself. Or was she? Maybe the giddy twit is the mask, and her true self is the vampire no one can send anywhere. \u201cTake a breath; you look like you\u2019re gonna faint.\u201d</p><p>While Madison managed a sickly smile, Fred leaned back in her chair and studied Betsy. She was glad she\u2019d chosen the venue she had. Yes, on the one hand they were discussing matters that were complex and dangerous and, most of all, private. Things you didn\u2019t necessarily want to discuss in public. Things that, if overheard, at best would bring eye rolls and titters, and worst, wooden stakes.</p><p>On the other hand, the chances were good that Betsy and/or the bad guys wouldn\u2019t try anything in such a public place. The more she learned about Betsy, the happier she was that they weren\u2019t in a big empty aquarium at night with lots of natural soundproofing.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I get why you\u2019re here, Betsy, but why not contact Madison directly? Go right to her for the scoop? Why skulk around\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never skulk.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014and hijack my brain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBarely. More like temporarily borrowed. You got it back, didn\u2019t you?\u201d Betsy shrugged. \u201cI wanted to see things for myself straight out. As much as I could, I wanted to get a fix on the bad guy, right? Which worked out exactly as I planned, except for the part about how you weren\u2019t the bad guy.\u201d</p><p>Her cell buzzed. \u201cDammit, Jonas! Enough! Take a hint.\u201d She glared at it, irritated, then did what she should have half an hour ago and clicked it off. Her best friend had been bugging her for hours to have dinner with him, and, yes, she\u2019d been out of town for weeks and wanted to hear his news, and she had missed him, too, but the last thing she needed was to have Jonas\u2014</p><p>\u201cThere you are, you uncommunicative tart!\u201d</p><p>\u2014dragged into this.</p><p>CHAPTER EIGHT</p><p>Jonas Carrey, her best friend since the second grade, bounded up to their corner table and greeted her with, \u201cForgot to shut down your cell tag, dummy.\u201d To Madison and Betsy: \u201cYou guys know she\u2019s a scientist, right? Unreal.\u201d To Fred: \u201cSo I was able to Sherlock my way right to your doorstep, not that this is it, exactly. And\u2014hello!\u201d He\u2019d hello\u2019d! because he\u2019d gotten a look at Betsy. Who was, Fred had to admit, very pretty if you liked vulgar blondes with nice racks and long legs and big clear greenish blue eyes and wiseass grins.</p><p>\u201cGo away, Jonas.\u201d</p><p>He ignored her, which he\u2019d also been doing since second grade. \u201cIf you\u2019re waiting for Fred to remember her manners and introduce us,\u201d he said to Betsy, shaking her hand, \u201cI hope you packed a snack.\u201d</p><p>Betsy laughed. \u201cI don\u2019t need to, here. And be nice to poor Fred. I kind of dropped in on her tonight.\u201d</p><p>Kind of?</p><p>Fred gritted her teeth. Years of experience had proven Jonas would remain as long as he liked; nothing short of knocking him unconscious would prevent his presence. Since he was already here, and presumably protected under the earlier probably-won\u2019t-make-a-scene-in-a-public-place logic, she reserved knocking him unconscious as Plan B. \u201cBetsy Taylor, this is my friend, Jonas Carrey. Jonas, this is Betsy. She\u2019s in town visiting Madison for a few hours.\u201d Please let it only be a few hours. \u201cI think you met Madison last year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeetcha.\u201d He stepped to the empty table beside them, snagged a chair, and settled in. \u201cSo what\u2019d I miss? What\u2019s going on? And hey\u2014great shoes.\u201d</p><p>The vampire looked absurdly flattered. \u201cThanks. I know they don\u2019t look it, but they\u2019re pretty comfortable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlice and Olivia, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d At once Betsy was a great deal more animated. \u201cYeah, they just screamed, \u2018Spring!\u2019 at me and it was a cloudy chilly day and I\u2019m one of those people who\u2019s always cold so I couldn\u2019t resist.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He nodded. \u201cI know how it goes. The heart wants what the heart wants, and so do the feet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJonas, please stop talking about shoes or get out of here, but you\u2019ve gotta pick at least one.\u201d</p><p>Jonas held up his hands. \u201cOh, simmer, I\u2019m just making conversation with your new friend\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot. My. Friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo just put down the glass of haterade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s wonderful,\u201d Betsy said, smiling. \u201cI\u2019m stealing it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay,\u201d Jonas said, \u201cI did, too. Amazon forums, would you believe it? But seriously, you guys\u2014why are the three of you sitting up here almost by yourselves in a giant food court when none of you are eating much of anything, when you\u2019ve barely been back in town ten hours\u201d\u2014nodding at Fred\u2014\u201cbecause of something you\u2019ve done.\u201d Nodding at Madison. \u201cIs it super-secret mermaid stuff?\u201d</p><p>No one seemed to know how to answer him until Betsy spoke up. \u201cNo. Super-secret vampire stuff.\u201d</p> <p>Fred was astonished, and then frightened, and then admiring. That fanged cow wants Jonas to be curious. She had a very specific reason to tell him what she did and she did it in a very specific way. She wants people I care about in this. She wants them nearby. Because that will make me be careful. Maybe I\u2019ll be so worried about keeping Madison and Jonas out of trouble, I won\u2019t have time to kick her undead ass all over the NEA break room. Nice one, blondie. Maybe you only look like a vapid dumbass.</p><p>The irrepressible Jonas took it well, considering. \u201cYou guys are vampires now?\u201d he gasped.</p><p>\u201cNot her.\u201d Betsy, jerking her head at Fred. Then she nodded at Madison. \u201cHer mom. And me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why you\u2019re chilly to the touch?\u201d Fred asked. She\u2019d been wondering about it before, but in the ensuing excitement had forgotten. But now she was thinking about Betsy grabbing her wrists in the break room, how cold her grasp was. \u201cYou can\u2019t keep a ninety-eight point six body temp anymore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said with a sad sigh. \u201cI\u2019m always cold. Even in summertime. It\u2019s a terrible burden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry swimming the Arctic Ocean in January sometime,\u201d Fred snapped back, unmoved.</p> <p>\u201cOoooh,\u201d Jonas said, leaning back in his chair. \u201cIs there gonna be a mermaid-vampire smackdown?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere already was,\u201d Madison said, picking up her drink, looking at it, and putting it down once more. Fred estimated she\u2019d drank about twenty milliliters at most. A waste of a daiquiri. \u201cIt was rilly horrible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhaaaaaaat?\u201d Jonas\u2019s chair came forward with a thunk. \u201cAnd I missed it? Dammit! I knew I should have tracked you down the first time you blew off my text. The event of the century and I was stuck on the Red Line! So who won?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it was a tie. Then Fred stripped naked and swam in the Giant Ocean Tank and proved she was a mermaid because Betsy never watches TV.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd where was I? Son of a bitch!\u201d Jonas smacked himself on the forehead, like a man vigorously checking himself for fever. \u201cOkay, from the top. Seriously, guys. Start over. I wanna hear everything. We\u2019re wasting valuable time, time that could be spent making me feel like I was there and didn\u2019t miss the awesomest evening out ever.\u201d</p><p>And because Fred and Betsy had the same thought, though they didn\u2019t know it (I still have questions and Madison still hasn\u2019t told us everything), the mermaid and the vampire thought that was a fine plan.</p><p>\u201cDoes he do this a lot?\u201d the vampire asked. Fred noticed that, as she\u2019d sucked all the liquid from her smoothie, she\u2019d begun eyeing Madison\u2019s all-but-untouched drink. Hmmm. Unnatural thirst? How often does she have to suck down blood? And when did she last do so? Hmmm. \u201cJust plop himself in the middle of something and assume he belongs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince we were seven.\u201d Fred sighed.</p> <p>Betsy\u2019s smile widened. \u201cYeah. I\u2019ve got one of those, too.\u201d She didn\u2019t elaborate, but unless the vampire was an Oscar-caliber actress, she was looking at Jonas with genuine fondness, and for that, Fred could almost forgive the mind snatch.</p><p>CHAPTER NINE</p><p>\u201cSo I came to town for the Tall Ships thing\u2014\u201d</p><p>Fred winced. Don\u2019t do it. Don\u2019t. Don\u2019t. She might finally be ready to tell the whole thing. At last you\u2019ll have answers. So keep your piehole shut tight.</p><p>\u201c\u2014but, like, they were late or whatever, or I was early, because\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jonas frowned at her. \u201cDon\u2019t, Fred.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014the ships weren\u2019t there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not!\u201d Fred had held herself in as long as humanly (or Undersea Folk-ey) possible. vzyl \u201cThat\u2019s in the summer, as anyone within five hundred miles of Boston knows, it\u2019s always in the summer. Who comes for Tall Ships in the spring?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I can see how that would annoy a local,\u201d Betsy conceded, \u201cbut come on, are you gonna interrupt after every sentence? How many hours have you allotted to story time? I could be hanging out with my insane husband right this minute.\u201d</p><p>Which was worse, being reprimanded by a thieving vampire, being confronted with Madison\u2019s essential stupidity, realizing that Jonas would rip into her snobbery when he could get her alone, or knowing the vampire was correct? \u201cNnngghh. Go on. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd also, I thought maybe mermaids would be interested in tall ships, and maybe I could meet a couple more. You, um, you said you\u2019d introduce me to some, but you\u2019ve been super busy.\u201d</p><p>I will not feel guilty. I will not feel guilty. I will not feel guilty for politely blowing her off.</p><p>\u201cAnd also, I was hoping to meet some people that I\u2019d met online, doing the PR stuff for the NEA and for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFred doesn\u2019t even do her own PR stuff; she wouldn\u2019t stick you with it,\u201d Jonas agreed.</p><p>\u201cExcept I did,\u201d Fred said slowly, remembering.</p><p>Jonas threw up his hands. \u201cWell, great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMadison offered to catch the e-mails for NEA\u2019s \u2018Ask a Mermaid\u2019 page.\u201d Just saying the name of the thing out loud made her want to break things. \u201cThe volume. You wouldn\u2019t believe the volume of stupid, stupid, stupid questions. There were almost as many of those as there were sex questions. You wouldn\u2019t believe what some people wanted me to do with my tail.\u201d</p><p>Betsy made a strange sound and clapped her hands over her mouth; Fred realized she\u2019d barked laughter without meaning to. She took her hands away and said, \u201cIt\u2019s awful you had to be exposed to those and then exposed Madison to those.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d Fred coughed. \u201cMadison was there and she offered and she\u2019s good at it.\u201d Fred saw the young woman blush with pleasure, the first time that evening she hadn\u2019t looked like she was coming down with a violent stomach virus. \u201cAnd she offered to do the press releases, too, and I said sure.\u201d</p><p>Jonas was nodding. \u201cOkay, yeah, I get it.\u201d To Betsy: \u201cFred hates that shit. If she had her way, she\u2019d dig a hole in a Cape Cod sand dune and live in it and hardly ever leave it except to bitch at tourists for building sand castles in her yard and maybe bathe.\u201d</p><p>Fred kept her mouth shut. It\u2019s not like he\u2019s lying. Ahhhh . . . my own sand dune . . . my own hole in the beach . . . The thought was so haunting and beautiful she wanted to cry.</p><p>\u201cOkay, so I was rilly, rilly flattered that Fred trusted me with it.\u201d</p><p>More like couldn\u2019t be bothered with it and didn\u2019t care who did it as long as I didn\u2019t have to, but okay. Sure. Please go on.</p><p>\u201cI figured if I did a good job, maybe I could meet some more of your Undersea friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwww, Madison.\u201d Jonas patted her hand. \u201cThat\u2019s where you went wrong. Fred doesn\u2019t have any friends, Undersea or otherwise, except me, and that\u2019s just because I lost the coin toss with God.\u201d</p><p>Betsy had now snaked Madison\u2019s drink for herself and was sucking it down. \u201cSo you dumped your job on Madison, who did her best to make you proud . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Fred said sharply. \u201cIt was never my job. Dr. Barb set the whole page up after the Folk outed themselves on CNN. There are pages on the website for the penguins and the sea turtles, and those aren\u2019t my job, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep, that\u2019s true. Fred\u2019s former boss is my current sexy squeeze . . . She told me you weren\u2019t keen on the idea, which is Freddish for get away from me with that thing before I vomit and embark on a killing, puking rampage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did she expect? I had next to no privacy after all that. People would come up to me and do the weirdest things. Mermaids don\u2019t grant wishes, that\u2019s myth number one I\u2019d like addressed and then smothered. Thank God I was the unofficial bridge between the races, because after a while the royal family appointed actual capable ambassadors, which we all should have realized they should have done in the first place. I\u2019ll be the first to admit: even though I signed on for it, I sucked at that job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t all be recovering Miss Congenialities,\u201d Betsy said cheerfully.</p><p>\u201cOkay, whatever. After a few months it got so bad I got the hell out of Dodge. I\u2019ve been tagging along with my fianc\u00e9 while he makes the fellowship rounds.\u201d Fred pointed to her head. \u201cThis weird red is not my natural hair color.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice, though,\u201d Betsy commented after eyeing the fake hue. \u201cAuburn, with deeper auburn lowlights.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Jonas said, bowing from the waist. He managed to do it from a chair without looking ridiculous. \u201cFred kicked up such a fuss you\u2019d think I\u2019d shaved it instead of dying it Awesome Awesome. (And if that\u2019s not a real name for a hair color, it should be.)\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t ask you to do that,\u201d she snapped. \u201cI had a box of Yuck-O Brown Number Twenty-one all ready to go.\u201d Even now, the memory of Jonas\u2019s horrified screams made her shudder. He\u2019d actually knocked her to the ground to wrench Yuck-O Brown Number Twenty-one out of her hand, then dragged her to a salon and personally supervised the cut and coloring. \u201cThat was three hours of my life, gone forever.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOooh, I wish my friend could do that!\u201d Betsy said, looking at Fred\u2019s hair with renewed interest. \u201cShe just laughs at my home-dye errors. What color is it under all that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreen,\u201d Fred answered curtly. She did not want the discussion veering further toward her hair.</p><p>\u201cSorry, what? Green? Your natural hair color is\u2014oh, right. Mermaid thing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOoooh, but all those who truly lurrrrrrv her see it as blue,\u201d Jonas said, fluttering his eyelashes.</p><p>Fred longed to punch him. \u201cSome people see it as blue,\u201d she admitted. \u201cI hate the ambiguity . . . Blue, green, who gives a shit? It just perpetuates the stereotype that the Folk are magical. We\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>They looked at her.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not!\u201d She shook off their stares. \u201cAnyway, thanks to Jonas, I\u2019m harder to recognize now. Case in point, Betsy: you had no idea who I was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should set the bar higher,\u201d the vampire advised. \u201cI\u2019ve been dealing with a bunch of my own shit lately. Me not knowing who you were isn\u2019t the same as the average gal on the street not knowing.\u201d</p> <p>The thought that Betsy would willfully ignore spectacular current events further irked Fred, who wasn\u2019t blind to the irony. She hated the fuss and she got annoyed when someone didn\u2019t know about the fuss. Jonas is right; he really is one of my few friends, and for years he was my only friend. This sort of thing is the reason why. Still . . . \u201cThis was an unprecedented event in history!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, my shoe closet wasn\u2019t gonna organize itself, okay? And that\u2019s only one of the things I got stuck dealing with. I\u2019ve got more on my plate than whatever the latest fad is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyway,\u201d Jonas broke in, \u201cMadison was nice enough to help you out with work you had no intention of doing. And then . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I met these guys\u2014they sent lots of stuff to Fred\u2019s page\u2014\u201d</p><p>Not my page! Fred closed her eyes but said nothing.</p> <p>\u201cAnd they seemed rilly nice and they, like, had all these great ideas to help the Folk\u2014cool stuff like how to use legal precedent to show the world that anything abandoned in the ocean, y\u2019know like ship wrecks and pirate booty and all that, they had a way to prove how it all legally belongs to the Undersea Folk.\u201d</p><p>Ah. This was sensible. Though most of the planet (the ones who didn\u2019t think the mermaid thing was a hoax) outwardly embraced the Undersea Folk, some countries had gotten touchy about the Folk\u2019s vast treasure. A few of the dignitaries realized the Folk had in their possession, among other goodies: caches of Confederate gold, Blackbeard\u2019s treasure (scooped from caves of the Cayman Islands), Incan gold from lakes in the Colombian Andes, King John\u2019s crown jewels, fist-sized diamonds from the wreck of the Flor de la Mar, and other priceless artifacts (including the Kusanagi-no-Tsurugi sword, the Aphrodite of Cnidus, Michelangelo\u2019s Sleeping Cupid, and the Lighthouse of Alexandria) and began legal proceedings to get \u201ctheir\u201d property back.</p><p>The Folk\u2019s response to this was simplicity itself: finders keepers. As King Mekkam said, \u201cHow can treasures that rested on the bottom of the seas for centuries, treasures gone so long no one living even remembers them much less requires them, how can such things belong to any lander now living?\u201d The king had been too polite to point out that the Undersea Folk were well within lander laws regarding salvage: they took the risk, they got to keep the goodies. It was a growing problem; Fred acknowledged to herself that she would have looked into the strangers\u2019 ideas just as Madison had.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, they had other ideas, too, and so we agreed to meet and they thought I was you and then they tried to kill me.\u201d</p><p>Betsy, who\u2019d had a look of polite interest on her face, sat up straight, the better to look straight at Madison. \u201cYou\u2019re kidding.\u201d</p><p>Fred, who could feel her eyebrows arching (they were also red, thanks to Jonas\u2019s tireless efforts to drive her mad with minutia), asked what, to her, was the obvious question: \u201cHow could they think you were me?\u201d</p><p>Madison sucked in breath, then let it out. \u201cCauseItoldthemIwas.\u201d</p><p>Jonas cringed, waiting for the inevitable shit storm from Hurricane Fred. When no one said anything, Madison continued in a small voice: \u201cI told them. I said I was you.\u201d</p> <p>It took Fred a moment to find her voice. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Betsy said, also puzzled. \u201cWhy would you ever say that? Of all the un-fun weirdos you could be, why would you ever\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m handling this, Betsy.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014ever\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014ever want to be her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause that\u2019s all I\u2019ve ever wanted to be!\u201d Madison flashed, anger chasing shame in her shout. \u201cWhy d\u2019you think out of all the aquariums in the country\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many can there be?\u201d the vampire from Minnesota asked. \u201cSix? Seven?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSixty-three,\u201d Fred and Madison said in unison. Madison continued alone. \u201cWhy d\u2019you think I ended up here? I\u2019ve been following your career since your research project at Woods Hole. People don\u2019t really like you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are wise to see the truth,\u201d Jonas noted.</p><p>\u201c\u2014but they fall all over themselves offering you fellowships and grant money. Then, boom! You\u2019re a mermaid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd not just any mermaid\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cA seriously grumpy one. With blue hair except when people think it\u2019s green.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetsy, shut up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, but you know I\u2019m right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what you think of me\u2014another spoiled brat intern playing at marine bio on her mama\u2019s money\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think you were a brat, per se,\u201d Fred mumbled. She could feel herself blushing but, unlike Madison\u2019s rosy cheeks, it wasn\u2019t from pleasure. Everything she\u2019s said is right. So who\u2019s the real dumbass, Fredrika Bimm?</p><p>\u201cBut that was fine! I figured if I was useful, you\u2019d like me and we\u2019d hang. You didn\u2019t care that I was rich and you didn\u2019t care who my mom was. I\u2014I loved that. D\u2019you know how many people I\u2019ve met who don\u2019t care about Mama\u2019s money and connections? I could count them on one hand\u2014I could count them on three fingers. You just weren\u2019t interested and I thought\u2014I thought if I really put myself out there . . .\u201d She trailed off, shook her head at her own silliness, and continued. \u201cSo I started answering the really important e-mails as you. I figured I\u2019d set up all this research funding and legal strategies to help your friend the prince, and when it\u2019s all said and done, they\u2019re pissed I lied, they\u2019re pissed I\u2019m not you. And like a pathetic fool I go along with it! And now we\u2019re all in this mess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like an episode of Three\u2019s Company, with the goofy misunderstandings. Plus attempted murder and the pretty high chance at least one of you will end up shot in the face.\u201d Betsy grimaced and shook her head. \u201cHate getting shot. Stings like crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, wow, now I\u2019ve got questions for you, Betsy.\u201d Jonas turned his chair with a loud scrape, the better to face her. \u201cWhen you say stings like crazy do you mean stupid mosquitoes or ouchie, that\u2019s gonna need stitches?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you get away?\u201d Betsy asked, ignoring Jonas.</p><p>\u201cWell, they grabbed me and got my clutch, and then I played dumb long enough for them to let their guard down, and then I ran like hell, and I think, I think instead of coming after me they took off, because I never saw them outside the building. Mama got me a room at the Marriott. I was afraid to go home.\u201d</p><p>Jonas\u2019s eyes narrowed at Fred; she could pretty much read his thoughts: Let the playing-dumb thing go. It was good advice; she heeded it.</p><p>\u201cGood for you,\u201d Betsy said, nodding in approval. \u201cThat\u2019s my rule of thumb, too: when in doubt, play dumb and then run like hell. But they\u2019re still after you, right? They didn\u2019t try to kill you because you weren\u2019t Fred.\u201d</p><p>Madison was reluctant to contradict the vampire, who\u2019d been so nice to her, but had to correct the misunderstanding. \u201cWell, sure they did. They were so mad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, because they were really there to kill me.\u201d Fred kept her tone low and gentle. \u201cWhen they found out you weren\u2019t me, they knew they had to kill you, or you\u2019d warn me. Which you\u2019re doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOhhhhh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo Madison\u2019s mom called Betsy, and Madison called Fred. And you all met inside the NEA. Fred let you in?\u201d Jonas asked, turning to Madison.</p><p>She blinked, surprised. \u201cNo, I got there first. We agreed to meet but I only had to come a few hundred feet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you get in after hours?\u201d Fred asked.</p><p>\u201cOh! They tossed my clutch and someone found it right outside the hotel and brought it inside and the manager recognized my name and brought it right up. No credit cards,\u201d she added with a resigned shrug, \u201cor money, which I figured, but they left my library card and my frequent flier\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay. So who wants Fred dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, man.\u201d Jonas rubbed his eyes. \u201cIf we\u2019re gonna make a list of Fred\u2019s enemies, I\u2019m gonna need a drink.\u201d</p><p>Fred smiled sourly. Annoying and unpleasant as it was, Jonas was right: it would be a long, long list, and making said list wasn\u2019t even half of it.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll all need drinks.\u201d She sighed, and they got to it.</p><p>CHAPTER TEN</p><p>Jonas\u2019s help compiling the list of Fred Haters was invaluable, as Betsy and Madison pointed out. Fred, meanwhile, had a headache that got worse with each name.</p><p>\u201cBoo-hoo,\u201d Jonas replied. \u201cYou\u2019re just tired. You\u2019d be the first to admit you\u2019re not the victim here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot the victim,\u201d she agreed, \u201cbut it\u2019s still not much fun listening to you rattle off the names of those who loathe me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou should see my enemies list,\u201d Betsy said, as if Fred would find that comforting. (She was annoyed and grateful that the vampire\u2019s comment did, in fact, make her feel a little better.) \u201cIt was bad even before I died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout that . . .\u201d Fred had been so caught up in Madison\u2019s mess that she\u2019d had no time to indulge her curiosity, which was considerable. When she\u2019d woken that morning, she had no idea more people she\u2019d never met wanted to kill her, or that there were vampires outside of fiction. \u201cYou say you literally died? And came back? Because Madison said the same thing about her mom.\u201d And was disturbingly matter of fact about it. Guess it\u2019s true: if the weirdness is in your own family, if weirdness is all you know for the first few years of your life, it\u2019s hard to see it. \u201cSo you truly do die?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sure,\u201d the vampire said cheerfully. \u201cTruly\u2019s not the word for it; I was deader than the color-blocking fad. Of course, I would have returned from the dead no matter what, since it was a huuuuge matter of personal vengeance.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAgainst whoever murdered you?\u201d Fred asked, sympathetic. What must that be like, to experience your own murder . . . and then get better? Did her killer steal her brain first, like she tried to steal mine? Did she know what was happening at the end? I cannot think how awful that must have been, and what am I saying? I don\u2019t like her and I\u2019m not going to like her, so who cares, who cares, who cares?</p><p>\u201cWorse. Against my stepmother, who, when I wasn\u2019t even in the ground yet, stole all my designer shoes.\u201d</p><p>Jonas, still scribbling names, gasped.</p><p>\u201cAnd she\u2019s not even my shoe size! Pure spite, that\u2019s all it was. My Manolos, my Beverly Feldmans, my Zanottis, my YSLs, my Jimmy Choos\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease stop, I can\u2019t bear it,\u201d Jonas begged.</p> <p>Me, neither.</p><p>\u201c\u2014my black satin rose Roger Vivier pumps.\u201d</p><p>Jonas shrieked like his armpit hair had caught fire.</p><p>\u201cAnd left me to be buried in her crappy knockoffs that didn\u2019t even fit.\u201d</p><p>Jonas dropped the pen. \u201cTell me, tell me how many ways you killed her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t. My dad would have freaked; plus it would have ruined Christmas.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMore than your dying?\u201d Fred asked dryly.</p><p>\u201cI did put her tacky jewelry through her own blender,\u201d the vampire admitted. \u201cI won\u2019t deny it was super satisfying.\u201d</p><p>That had been the high point (egad!) of the last hour. When the list had reached seventy-nine\u2014</p><p>\u201c. . . and don\u2019t forget your old college roommate. And your mom\u2019s next-door neighbors. And my next-door neighbors. And our seventh grade English teacher. And your ninth grade English teacher. And the swimming instructor at the Y. And the yoga instructor at the Y.\u201d</p><p>\u2014Fred begged for a break. \u201cBesides, they\u2019ll be kicking us out soon; it\u2019s getting late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOooh, let me order another smoothie before they close,\u201d Betsy said, rising at once.</p><p>\u201cMake it a double,\u201d Jonas said. \u201cC\u2019mon, I know where the best ones are.\u201d</p><p>Fred\u2019s hand closed around Madison\u2019s bicep. \u201cNot you. I wanted to ask you something.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSounds ominous,\u201d Jonas said. Fred momentarily wondered if letting her friend go on a smoothie run with a vampire was smart, but her options were limited. And as before, she figured the chances of undead shenanigans were low. If push came to bite, Jonas was capable of handling himself. Insecure homophobes often took his extreme metrosexuality for homosexuality. This sometimes led to shoving matches escalating into punching matches, at which point Jonas would draw on his black belt(s) and make them his metrosexual bitches.</p><p>Once they were down the stairs and deep in conversation about shoes, have mercy, Fred turned her full attention to Madison.</p><p>\u201cOboy.\u201d Madison wouldn\u2019t meet her gaze. \u201cHere you go with the yelling, I bet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot too much,\u201d Fred lied. \u201cLook, I get that you were in a huge jam and I know you were scared, but would you please explain what possessed you to bring vampires into this? The queen of them, no less! I understand your mom wanting to help you, but sending us a vampire was not the way.\u201d Wait. Sending a vampire? Fred flashed back to Betsy and the gorgeous imposing guy outside the NEA. He\u2019d been trying to make a call and Betsy had been trying not to punch him. When she didn\u2019t know them, she compared them to apex predators. Mrs. Fehr sent us vampires, plural. That was her solution. Christ. Followed by, One of the vampires she sent keeps remarking on the other vampire\u2019s lack of sanity. Christ twice. \u201cYou mom couldn\u2019t control the situation from New York. They could have turned on us. In fact, Betsy did turn on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t; she didn\u2019t know you were my fr\u2014you were someone I knew. It\u2019s not turning on them if they don\u2019t know you\u2019re one of the good guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBig risk,\u201d she warned. \u201cEspecially with lives not your own. Right? And if your mom\u2019s on the coast and Betsy\u2019s in Minnesota, how did you\u2014or your mom\u2014even know her? Just because I\u2019m half UF doesn\u2019t mean I automatically know the life story of every other UF on the planet. So how could your mom know about Betsy\u2019s history? Or even that she died and came back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHistory?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Madison, history: events that happened before.\u201d If you don\u2019t kick-start your neurons and start thinking, this is gonna take longer than it already has, and then I will fucking kill myself, but I\u2019ll take you with me, I swear it on your dead mom\u2019s name, I will take you with me and maybe Betsy and her insane husband, too.</p><p>\u201cOh, there was this whole thing,\u201d Madison said, looking (Fred would have thought it was impossible) vaguer than usual.</p><p>\u201cThere was a thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm-hmm, in the papers or whatever . . . I guess all this happened in Minnesota and mama\u2019s friends kept her in the loop. Mama\u2019s got contacts all over the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich makes sense; she\u2019s had centuries to cultivate them. Go on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess Betsy\u2019s stepmother made like she was dead. Or maybe Betsy was the one playing the prank . . . it was this whole thing a couple of years ago, and everybody was upset\u201d\u2014Madison was making vague gestures that matched her vague expression\u2014\u201cand my mom read about it, or heard about it, or something, and ended up getting in touch with her. All because she thought Betsy was dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny how things work out, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHilarious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer stepmother\u2014Betsy called her the Bug, or something\u2014she was pretty bitchy. Maybe she told people Betsy was dead to be mean? Dunno. Maybe Betsy told people she was dead because she wanted to fool the Bug.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, as far as origin stories go, that was pretty bad.\u201d She should have guessed Madison wouldn\u2019t have sufficient details. Fred\u2019s curiosity was now bing-bonging away like Big Ben. \u201cYou know, when this is over, I\u2019d love to sit all the parties down and have a round-table session for the better part of a week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d the young woman said dully. \u201cYou\u2019ll want to talk to my mom, just like the Folk want to talk to you. You\u2019ll want to talk to Betsy; my mom will, too. She\u2019ll have to; I don\u2019t think she\u2019s paid tribute, but since the queen\u2019s helping me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat remains to be seen. All she\u2019s done is use me as her skeleton key and chug smoothies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell. Everyone\u2019s gonna talk to everyone else, and I\u2019ll just . . .\u201d She shrugged and trailed off.</p><p>Exasperated, Fred gently shook Madison\u2019s shoulder. \u201cKnock it off, Madison. You\u2019re a rich, gorgeous young woman who\u2019s probably had a zillion boyfriends while at the same time have never had a pimple. You\u2019re not invisible, for God\u2019s sake.\u201d</p><p>Madison just looked at her.</p><p>Oh. Is that how it is? Is that\u2019s how it\u2019s been her whole life? Overlooked in the face of her no-doubt fascinating mother? Doors open because of her no-doubt fascinating mother, but once Madison is inside, she disappears? Again and again and again?</p><p>Does she wonder, sometimes, if she can ever stand out? Orphans . . . her dead mother took in orphans. Madison\u2019s not the oldest nor the youngest; just one of a crowd of foundlings a dead woman pitied.</p><p>Fred quit shaking her. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said quietly, and did not let herself look away from the single tear that rolled down Madison Fehr\u2019s perfect cheek.</p><p>CHAPTER ELEVEN</p><p>Madison pulled herself back together, which was excellent, as Fred had few talents, and comforting crying women was not one of them. So as Jonas and Betsy came back up the stairs, Jonas holding smoothies and Betsy on her cell, Fred eavesdropped. Which was simple, since Betsy\u2019s voice had all the hushed modulation of an auctioneer on crack.</p><p>\u201cSinclair, it\u2019s the coolest place! We\u2019ve gotta come here once we get things cleared up; you will love it. You can get a smoothie and a lobster roll and a bowl of soup and a salad and a cream puff and licorice and sushi and a steak in the same building. Well. We can\u2019t, but you know what I mean.\u201d She held the phone away and called to Fred. \u201cOur Founding Fathers invented the food court! And also democracy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry to stay calm.\u201d But again, she couldn\u2019t help smiling to hear the exuberant blonde rhapsodize about the city she loved best. Funny how I had to face moving to the other side of the planet to finally appreciate my home. My true home, with my mom\u2019s people.</p><p>She would never have fit in beneath the Caspian Sea, pretending to co-rule the Undersea Folk. And she had never quite fit in on land, either. She belonged to not belonging and, as she had deduced right around the time she killed her father, likely always would. Funny how a realization that had seemed so awful at the time hurt a little less each day.</p><p>\u201c\u2014anyway, I\u2019m fine and I\u2019ll keep you posted, and listen, do you know anything about this we\u2019re-here-we\u2019re-mermaids-get-used-to-it thing? Because\u2014what? You do? Well, way to keep me in the loop, dude! We gotta talk about this . . . Yeah, I know I\u2019ve had other things on my mind, but I could have . . . What? . . . No, I should not watch more news; I get enough bad news from whatever contractor has to give me an estimate on how to fix whatever thing we broke that day. Why would I want to hear about ever more death and despair, and fishing-opener advisories and state fair coverage? \u2018Tonight on KARE Eleven: people suck.\u2019 Pass . . . Sorry, I didn\u2019t catch\u2014no I do not want to talk to the babies and, as I\u2019ve mentioned several times before and after you went insane, they are not babies!\u201d She glanced at Fred. \u201cI gotta go; the mermaid\u2019s here and she looks pissed about\u2014no, wait, that\u2019s just the way her face is . . . Yeah, that\u2019s right, I said mermaid, I\u2019ve been hanging out with one all night and I\u2019m not telling you one other thing. Love you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo now what?\u201d Jonas asked. \u201cWe could spend hours making the haters list longer, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not gonna be much help if we\u2019re gonna keep on with listing names,\u201d Betsy pointed out. \u201cAnd I want to. I think Madison here got a raw deal, and no matter how unpleasant and awful Fred is, she doesn\u2019t deserve this kind of hassle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said dryly. \u201cThat was your husband, right? He was outside with you earlier tonight. The tall dark-haired man?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMmm-hmm.\u201d Betsy fluttered her eyelashes. \u201cIsn\u2019t he dreeeeeeamy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess. He\u2019s a vampire, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd since you\u2019re the queen, that makes him the king?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGosh.\u201d Jonas faux sighed. \u201cBoston\u2019s soooo lucky! My horoscope didn\u2019t so much as hint at any of this today. Avoid situations with money, that\u2019s what I got. Thanks for nothing, universe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it dangerous to just . . . you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOut ourselves as blood suckers?\u201d Betsy teased.</p><p>\u201cWell. Yeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re trying things different than the last guy. This is the information age, the twenty-first century, and it\u2019s time for vampires to actually live in the real world with the rest of the real world. Does that make sense?\u201d</p><p>Madison and Jonas nodded; Fred did not.</p> <p>\u201cJust . . . take my word for it. A different way of running all things vampire was called for, so we\u2019re giving it a go. If it doesn\u2019t work, we can always go back to the skulking-in-dark-alleys, sleeping-in-coffins way of life. Yawn. And while we\u2019re throwing around personal questions, you\u2019re engaged, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Fred glanced at Jonas, a little nervous. She hadn\u2019t planned on him showing up but he had. Now she could only hope he\u2019d be so distracted by Madison\u2019s woes he wouldn\u2019t remember\u2014</p><p>\u201cWhich reminds me.\u201d</p><p>Fred groaned and buried her head in her forearms.</p><p>\u201cThe other two reasons you\u2019re in town this week are to visit your mom, who actually misses you\u2014weird, right? Yeah, but she\u2019s your mom, and just like with Cliff Clavin\u2019s mom on Cheers, nature dictates there be a bond.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s Cheers?\u201d Madison ventured.</p><p>\u201cOld TV show . . . The second reason you\u2019re in town is to meet with me and get more wedding stuff done. Now obviously Madison\u2019s little strange-men-tried-to-kill-me-and-will-stop-at-nothing-until-Fred\u2019s-dead-too thing comes first, but only just. So to answer your question, Fred\u2019s not only engaged (again), she\u2019s getting married in six months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJustice of the peace,\u201d Fred said, trying not to cave in to despair. \u201cNo cakes. No dresses. No churches. No pastors. A judge and a piece of paper. And then Legal\u2019s.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo way.\u201d Jonas turned to Betsy. \u201cShe was gonna marry a prince. Artur of the Undersea Folk, right? And have a royal wedding\u2014which she was letting me plan\u2014before jetting off to the other side of the planet to live in the Caspian Sea, where she wondered why her Kindle wasn\u2019t working. And I was gonna get to plan a royal wedding! But noooo, she decides she\u2019s in love with a romance novelist\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Betsy gasped, hanging onto Jonas\u2019s every (shrill) word.</p><p>\u201c\u2014dumps the prince\u2014a perfectly nice guy, by the way\u2014chucks all the old wedding plans, and thinks her mom and I are gonna let her do the justice-of-the-peace thing for fianc\u00e9 number two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll get killed by the guys Madison ran into,\u201d Fred said, brightening. \u201cThen no weddings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t that be great? Dare to dream. But first things first. Madison\u2019s mom asked me to come, which I was fine with, since I\u2019m a warm, cuddly, hands-on undead monarch. I\u2019ve got a responsibility to my subjects, and also apparently their adopted daughters. So devoted to duty am I, I didn\u2019t hesitate after I realized where the John Fluevog store was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Jonas\u2019s eyebrows arched into blond, horizontal parentheses. \u201cOh ho.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh ho what?\u201d Fred asked. \u201cWhat is a Fluevog?\u201d</p><p>Betsy\u2019s eyebrows were doing their own arching back at Jonas. \u201cI\u2019m betting you know where Newbury Street is, huh?\u201d</p><p>Fred snorted. \u201cIt\u2019s his Graceland.\u201d Newbury Street was one of Boston\u2019s older streets, crammed with ever more expensive boutiques and restaurants. Wikipedia dubbed it one of the most expensive streets in the world, as it was strewn with shops for Ralph Lauren, Donna Karan, Marc Jacobs, Chanel, and Armani, to name a few. It was beloved by locals as well as tourists. Fred wouldn\u2019t go there if someone stuck a gun in her ear.</p><p>\u201cI would very much like to see John Fluevog\u2019s John Fluevog store. And we\u2019ve been at this for hours, with no end in sight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we should quit and go look at shoes?\u201d Fred snapped. \u201cBe serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShoes, wedding gowns, whatever.\u201d Jonas shrugged.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even joke about that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d never, Fred. Also, John-John loves my toned blond ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s relevant . . . how, exactly?\u201d Why are you asking when you\u2019re afraid of the answer? Why are you asking someone who always answers your questions when you\u2019re afraid of the answer?</p><p>\u201cBecause I did him the favor of his life not even five years ago. But it\u2019s sorta confidential.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIntroduced him to his wife?\u201d Betsy guessed.</p><p>\u201cTook a bullet for him?\u201d Fred ventured.</p><p>\u201cGot him off marshmallow peeps?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEww, no. I cured him of his dandruff with my own home brew, and he\u2019s in my debt forever, or until I decide to quit Aveda and design my own hair products, so he can pay me back by financing my independent shop.\u201d</p><p>In response to Betsy\u2019s puzzled expression, Fred added, \u201cJonas is a chemical engineer; he designs shampoos and lotions and other smelly stuff for Aveda and now has found the cure for dandruff in shoe designers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow!\u201d</p><p>Fred was pleased Betsy was impressed with her friend, then annoyed to be pleased.</p><p>\u201cAre you single?\u201d The vampire plunged ahead when he started to answer. \u201cBecause I\u2019ve got the perfect guy for you. The perfect guy. Really cute, really smart\u2014a doctor. Takes things like vampire roommates and the Antichrist popping over for smoothies totally in stride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe zombie thing? We\u2019re working on it. With it, I guess. Listen, he can\u2019t die because he is already. Dead, I mean. So you\u2019ll always have a date! Until you die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow, so, so tempting, but I have to plan Fred\u2019s wedding. Not just plan her wedding, Planning Fred\u2019s Wedding, Take Two. And then . . . what was it? Oh, right. Get married myself. To a woman. Who I love. Who\u2019s alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Her face fell. \u201cWell, congratulations, I guess.\u201d</p><p>Fred sighed. \u201cHow come the weird ones are always taken?\u201d</p><p>Jonas gave Betsy\u2019s hand a quick pat. \u201cWell, anyway. Even as late as it is, I might be able to arrange for a visiting vampire queen to check out the hippest shoe store in a five-hundred-mile radius at, say, midnight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, now we\u2019re shoe shopping?\u201d Fred snapped. \u201cForget it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, we\u2019ll shop for wedding gowns instead. There\u2019s actually a gown shop right next to his store. What are the odds, I ask you? I\u2019m getting chills. The gods want us to go to Newbury Street with our American Express cards tonight! That\u2019s what all this is for! And also, saving Madison from killers.\u201d</p><p>A long silence, broken by Fred\u2019s weary, \u201cFine. Shoes. God help me. But first, Madison, I need to see all the e-mails and online correspondence you had with the would-be killers. Which I probably should have thought to ask for first. And we should all get descriptions of the guys in question . . . the other thing I should have thought of first.\u201d Fred wished she could blame the vampire\u2019s brain snatch on how amateur her response had been, but the truth was Fred had shaken off Betsy\u2019s mojo hours ago. The problem was, too much had been thrown at her in too short a time. Another problem: they weren\u2019t cops. They had no lawful authority. They were in over their heads, and not by inches. By entire fathoms. Which reminded her . . .</p><p>\u201cIs there a reason we\u2019re not giving full reports to the police and having them look into this? Yeah, our little group is made up of things like vampires and mermaids and chemical engineers and rich wards of ancient vamps\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like we could be out in the world solving crimes. I always wanted my own Mystery Machine,\u201d Jonas commented.</p><p>\u201c\u2014but we have no lawful authority. Do you know how to make a citizen\u2019s arrest? I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Betsy shook her head. \u201cIf you tell the police even a tenth of the truth, they\u2019ll lock you up. You\u2019ll end up in a psych ward somewhere with a Valium drip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, that\u2019d be great.\u201d Fred sighed, and Madison nodded.</p><p>\u201cOf course it would be great, but it doesn\u2019t get anything done. And it leaves poor Madison even more exposed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we don\u2019t want Madison exposed,\u201d Jonas said. Then: \u201cThat was less lewd in my head, and more protective.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, what?\u201d Betsy spread her hands. \u201cWe\u2019ve gotta go somewhere, but we don\u2019t know where, and we\u2019ve gotta do something, but we don\u2019t know what, and we\u2019ve gotta find bad guys, but we don\u2019t know who. Hell, I barely know where I am; I don\u2019t know this part of the country at all. I took a cab from our hotel so I wouldn\u2019t have to pahk\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Jonas and Betsy warned in unison.</p><p>\u201c\u2014the cah in Hahvahd yahd.\u201d The vampire beamed. \u201cDon\u2019t I sound legit? Like I\u2019ve lived in Boston my whole life and for a while after my death? I sound wicked smaht!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe hate that,\u201d Jonas said, and Fred nodded. Her saying she hated something was nothing new; it might make a stronger impression if someone as easygoing as Jonas said it. \u201cEvery goddamned tourist in the world thinks it\u2019s hilarious, and they all trot it out, usually when we\u2019re trapped with them on a subway car. And they\u2019re awful at it. And have you noticed Fred and I don\u2019t drop our rs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was a little let down,\u201d Betsy confessed. \u201cI figured you\u2019d be dropping them all over the place.\u201d</p><p>Fred tapped the table to direct Betsy\u2019s attention to her. \u201cI mean, do you guys like it when HBO reruns Fargo and half the world thinks everyone in Minnesota talks in this here kind of accent, then? And then when yer talkin\u2019 in that there kinda accent and sayin\u2019, \u2018Yah, you betcha\u2019 alla time with those big head nods, d\u2019you like that there? Or not so much, then?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m very, very sorry,\u201d the vampire said at once. Betsy was the picture of contrite. \u201cYou\u2019re right. It\u2019s awful. We should all just move to North Carolina, then. They\u2019ve got that there nice southern accent, like syrup, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, all right,\u201d Fred said, magnanimous in her triumph. \u201cBut we\u2019re getting off course, again. Madison, I\u2019ll need those e-mails, and also\u2014what did these guys look like? How many were there?\u201d</p><p>Madison was again unable to look her in the eye, so she stared over her shoulder instead.</p><p>\u201cCome on, it\u2019s all right,\u201d Betsy said kindly. \u201cLike everyone else at this table\u2014in this building, in this city, even\u2014hasn\u2019t gotten in over their head? We all have\u2014hell, over my head is the norm in my part of the world. So how do we find the turds who wanna rid the world of the anti-Ariel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo not call me\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThree of them are here now,\u201d Madison whispered, still staring over Fred\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>CHAPTER TWELVE</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look!\u201d Madison hissed.</p><p>Too late. \u201cOh, what fresh hell is this?\u201d Fred muttered, trying to stare without staring.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re here? That\u2019s them? Yesssss!\u201d Betsy pumped her fist. \u201cWhat luck! Let\u2019s go get \u2019em.\u201d</p><p>As Fred tried not to gape at the vampire with admiration, Jonas shook his head. \u201cLuck isn\u2019t the first word that popped into my brain,\u201d he said, also trying to look without looking.</p> <p>\u201cJonas, please get Madison the fuck out of here right now,\u201d Fred said, keeping a smile on her face and projecting I\u2019m not worried, I\u2019m not worried, what bad guys? as hard as she could. \u201cGo somewhere safe; do not linger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMadison, have I mentioned the deplorable state of your split ends? I know,\u201d he said, rising and cutting her off before she could speak, \u201cyou\u2019ve had other things on your mind. But accidentally setting up your old boss to be murdered and then getting your mom to send the king and queen of the vampires to town to hang out in Faneuil Hall drinking smoothies is no excuse. So we\u2019re off to a friend\u2019s salon. Sure it\u2019s late, and sure we\u2019re exhausted, but your hair, Madison, your hair. Did I mention the friend\u2019s wife is a homicide detective for our fair city? I\u2019m thinking at least three inches off the ends.\u201d Jonas unhurriedly strolled with Madison toward the exit opposite the approaching bad guys. Fred had to admire the sheer slickness of the man. She knew he was afraid and she knew he didn\u2019t want to leave her. But he also knew Madison was the most vulnerable . . . and the most frightened. I might only have one friend, but he\u2019s a keeper. Better one Jonas than a thousand friends not half as wonderful.</p><p>\u201cHe would have been so perfect for my dead doctor.\u201d Betsy sighed.</p><p>\u201cHow many brains can you hijack at once?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, sorry? Oh. Oh!\u201d Betsy was watching the men approach, looking as unconcerned as Fred was\u2014she hoped. \u201cMojo, you mean. Um . . . one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat leaves me with two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood work, Dr. Bimm! You\u2019re, like, soooo good at math.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou realize when you talk like that you make my ears bleed, right?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t before; I guess it\u2019s, like, a bonus.\u201d</p><p>Fred groaned. Vampires channeling valley girls. Maybe I\u2019ll luck out and these three will kill us. Death can\u2019t be worse than this whole awful evening.</p><p>The men approached, taking their time. Dressed, Fred thought gloomily, for ass kicking: casual pants, pressed polo shirts (one in indigo blue, one in brown, one in black), dark socks, loafers. They all had cell phones clipped to their belts, but Fred could see no guns. Their hair color ranged from blond to brown, and all sported military-short haircuts. Two of them had dark eyes; the shortest brunette (short being relative; they were all at least six feet) had blue eyes. All were trim and muscular; they moved like a team. They had done things together. Probably a lot of things.</p><p>Soldiers, Fred realized, feeling her heart drop to her ankles. Some kind of soldiers; these are not random baddies. Tell me an entire army doesn\u2019t want me dead. Bad enough the entire staff at the downtown Y wants me dead . . .</p><p>\u201cWe were looking for your friend, Dr. Bimm,\u201d the one in the black shirt said politely. Dark colors to blend at night. And in this part of town, those nicey-nice tourist outfits, that\u2019s practically a uniform. No one would look twice. \u201cWhat luck to find you, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuper-duper-awesome-great good luck,\u201d Fred said without a trace of a smile. Keep them here and off Jonas. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you three go fuck yourselves and leave us alone? And go to hell and drop dead and any other disrespectful thing you don\u2019t want me to say in front of your boyfriends. Don\u2019t worry. We\u2019ll wait. Make a list.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll wait; I don\u2019t have all night. Besides, all the food stalls are closed now,\u201d Betsy added. \u201cYou can\u2019t get so much as a glass of milk. What good is Nathaniel Hall without the food?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFaneuil Hall,\u201d Fred corrected her sharply.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure? Because that name makes no sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m sure, I\u2019ve lived here most of\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got team members scooping up your friend and Ms. Fehr,\u201d the blond, brown-eyed chap in the middle said, soooo politely. \u201cAnd we know your other friend has been with you half the night, hearing all sorts of things that should never have come out of your big mouth, so she\u2019ll need to come with us, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwwww, you picked me!\u201d Betsy turned to Fred. \u201cThis is so much better than high school. I never got picked first for Phys Ed. This is like high school with goons and guns.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut your mouth!\u201d Fred wanted to punch Black Shirt as much as she wanted to scream; she indulged in the latter for now. \u201cThis woman is not my friend!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now you\u2019ve ruined it.\u201d The vampire sighed. \u201cThis part is also like high school.\u201d</p><p>Brown Shirt\u2019s phone buzzed, and he and his two buddies smiled. It\u2019s a signal; they\u2019ve got Jonas. Fuck.</p><p>\u201cTake them,\u201d Black Shirt said, sounding almost bored. \u201cRight now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just right,\u201d Fred began, but stopped when Betsy laid a hand on her arm.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get your fins in a bunch, Fred. I\u2019ve got this. Okay, asshats, too bad for you that I\u2019m as badass as I am hot-looking, because now you\u2019re in for\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust . . . stop.\u201d Fred took three steps, passed Betsy on the right, and in less than a blink had flanked and seized Black Shirt by the collar and twisted. His yelpish bark (\u201cBlaayarrk!\u201d) startled almost everyone in their little group. She shoved him back, hard, and didn\u2019t have to watch to see he\u2019d gone sailing past the tables and over the railing to crash with a horrid thud on the hard floor one story below.</p><p>Even now it had been less than a moment, so she had all the time in the world to turn and dodge Indigo Shirt\u2019s hand, his fingers stiffened to chop. She grabbed said stiff fingers and twisted, smiling a little at his pained yowl; then she forced his elbow to bend the wrong way, and smiled wider when his howl abruptly stopped as he passed out. She felt a blow land on her left shoulder and kicked back; the last one flew into their now-empty chairs so hard the chairs imploded on impact.</p><p>\u201cWhoa.\u201d Betsy was staring. \u201cChairs don\u2019t bust up like that except in the movies. Eww, he\u2019s got wood stuck to him\u2014in him\u2014everywhere, he\u2019s\u2014Oh my God, he\u2019s got a splinter in his eye! What eye, ha-ha. Um, will you think less of me if I throw up now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop talking. Must you preface every single thing you do with nauseating endless speculative continual monologues?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you know, boys,\u201d Betsy said, staring. \u201cLet that, uh, be a lesson to you. All three of you. When you wake up. If you wake up.\u201d The vampire seemed pleased. \u201cI almost never get saved, y\u2019know? I usually have to do the saving. This trip to Boston, it\u2019s like a vacation for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow wonderful for you,\u201d Fred snarled, seizing her wrist and dragging her toward the far exit. \u201cCome on, some of their goons have got Jonas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m guessing all that swimming around in the deep ocean depths makes you ferociously strong as well as ferociously grouchy? You\u2019re kind of an effortless badass.\u201d Betsy was, thank goodness, allowing herself to be dragged. In fact, Fred was moving so quickly the other woman\u2019s feet occasionally left the floor. \u201cIt\u2019s great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the effortlessness that makes it really cool,\u201d she said cheerfully.</p><p>\u201cI just want this night to end,\u201d Fred groaned.</p><p>\u201cNot me! It just got interesting.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTEEN</p><p>\u201cThey underestimated you,\u201d Betsy said as Fred flew through the exit door and raced for the emergency stairs. \u201cNot just a little. They underestimated you by yards and yards. I did, too, which was pretty dumb of me. You did sort of make me fly through the fish warehouse with the greatest of ease. And you\u2019re smart, too\u2014a doctor! But not a real one.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Argh. She has a natural gift for hitting all of my buttons. Since when does a PhD in anything but medicine means you\u2019re not a real doctor?</p><p>Incredibly, she was still babbling as Fred hurtled toward the stairs. \u201cOkay, sure, you\u2019re smarter than me and prettier\u2014maybe a little prettier\u2014but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not prettier than you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cQuit it! I hate when pretty girls act like we don\u2019t know we\u2019re pretty. They don\u2019t, is what I meant. When they act like they don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Ah! These go down to the street, and Jonas has to be at the end of the street. \u201cAbsurd. You look like you fell off a Vogue runway. Can you handle a three-story fall?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yeah, in the sense that it won\u2019t kill me, but it\u2019ll still sting like\u2014shit!\u201d</p><p>Fred threw her over the railing, grabbed the same railing, and vaulted over. As the street rushed up to them she heard, \u201cYou suuuuuuuuuuuuck!\u201d</p><p>All the way down.</p> <p>Fred landed hard and couldn\u2019t keep her feet, but managed to roll with the impact. When she stood, her feet and ankles ached horribly but nothing was broken. She\u2019d gotten more from her father than the tail\u2014the strength and the dense bones\u2014for which she was often annoyed but tonight was thankful.</p><p>\u201cYou are too pretty!\u201d Betsy was flailing in garbage. \u201cAnd that was a shitty thing to do to a guest!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot my guest,\u201d Fred muttered, looking for Jonas. \u201cAnd once you get the garbage out of your hair, you\u2019ll be pretty again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a lie and you know it.\u201d</p><p>From around the corner, an aggrieved shriek: \u201cYou\u2019re both hags! Shut up!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d Betsy had climbed to her feet and was brushing coffee grounds off her clothes. \u201cHe\u2019s almost as bitchy as my zombie.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy doctor, I meant. He gets shrill when he\u2019s tired, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour doctor zombie.\u201d Fred sighed. So many questions. But maybe she should keep some to herself. At once she felt shame; proximity to the vampire queen was turning her into a mental and moral coward with all this I-don\u2019t-want-to-know and keep-me-out-of-it nonsense. And even knowing that, understanding that, did not make her want to discuss zombies with the fanged blonde.</p><p>She shook off the thoughts and raised her voice. \u201cBe right there, Jonas!\u201d So he hadn\u2019t been picked up by the baddies . . . that was good. He hadn\u2019t sounded under duress, which was better\u2014not in imminent danger of being shot or plummeting three stories. She assumed Madison was also all right\u2014Jonas was, at heart, a gentleman, and wouldn\u2019t leave a lady in distress if someone kneecapped him with a ball peen hammer. \u201cIdiot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, these bad guys . . . sooo rude. They could at least call first if they\u2019re gonna show up and beat their chests and then let you go through them like a band saw through a hot dog.\u201d</p><p>Heh. \u201cI meant Madison. She\u2019s the reason I\u2019m\u2014we\u2019re all\u2014in this mess. And for what? Because she doesn\u2019t get enough attention at home? Christ.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, come on.\u201d Betsy was wobbling, then her steps became more sure. Fred had no idea how, but the blonde had managed to kick off her beautiful shoes during her shrieking plummet to the street, then find them again (in the dark\u2014the closest street light was a block south) and slip them back on, and was now keeping pace as Fred hurried through the alley. \u201cShe\u2019s just a kid. Just like you were once and just like I was once\u2014Shit! These cobblestones are a bitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a grown woman, she\u2019s been the legal drinking age for years, and even if she wasn\u2019t, I\u2019m not her mother, and even if I was, she\u2019s a grown woman.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI need to meet her mother,\u201d Betsy said in the tone of someone making a mental to-do list.</p><p>\u201cYeah, and Madison\u2019s mom, frankly, should be the one getting jumped in Faneuil Hall and mind-raped in the Aquarium.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd my husband should still be sane and every member of the Kardashian family should be indicted, arrested, and executed. It\u2019s not a perfect world. She\u2019s your responsibility, and bitching about it won\u2019t help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d Fred\u2019s eyes had quickly adjusted to the dark\u2014another genetic gift from the Folk, as it was pretty damned dark at the bottom of the ocean. So she could see Betsy\u2019s wry expression, and was startled at how pale she was\u2014even for her. \u201cShe\u2019s in this mess because she looks up to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s in this mess,\u201d Fred said firmly, \u201cbecause she\u2019s an idiot.\u201d</p><p>Betsy was getting still paler. Fred had a sudden suspicion that she was one of those people who went white when they were pissed. If she\u2019s dead\u2014undead\u2014how does her blood even circulate? When she\u2019s pale does it mean she\u2019s mad or hungry or what? I\u2019ve killed at least one man, maimed two others, and am now jogging down a dark alley with a hungry vampire I might be pissing off. I have a genius for getting into these situations.</p><p>\u201cHow often do you need to fe\u2014\u201d</p><p>Betsy cut her off. \u201cAgain: you\u2019ve got to help her fix it. You. Not Jonas and not her mom\u2014though I think she could have come to town in addition to asking me to come, but that\u2019s a chat for another night. No matter how much they annoy you, no matter how big a pain in your ass they are, you\u2019re in it, Fred.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh ho. It\u2019s like that?\u201d</p><p>The vampire made a gesture; half shrug, half frustration. \u201cDo you think I came back from the dead overjoyed to discover I was responsible for thousands and thousands of people, whether they were awful and needed to be stopped, or victimized and needed my help? Or just minding their own business and sucking on stray cats and not bothering anybody? Come on. God\u2019s got a wicked sense of humor, putting me in charge. But I\u2019ll tell you what I learned, Fred; what I\u2019m still learning. Bitching and moaning about it just makes everything take longer.\u201d She paused. \u201cIf you meet my husband, never tell him I said that.\u201d</p><p>Fred wasn\u2019t moved to laugh. If anything, she wanted to cry. \u201cI didn\u2019t want any of this. I didn\u2019t ask for any of this!\u201d</p><p>The queen\u2019s eyes went wide. \u201cYou think that\u2019s relevant? That you didn\u2019t ask for this? Christ, it\u2019s the least relevant thing ever! It doesn\u2019t matter that you don\u2019t want it and it doesn\u2019t matter that you don\u2019t deserve it and it doesn\u2019t matter that you don\u2019t have the time or the authority or the willpower; you have to fix this.\u201d Suddenly realizing she\u2019d been almost screaming, Betsy cleared her throat and walked faster.</p><p>Fred hurried to keep pace. \u201cIs it possible you\u2019re projecting on me, just a little?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sure,\u201d she admitted. \u201cAlso, I\u2019m a flaming hypocrite.\u201d</p><p>They trotted in silence for a few seconds. \u201cThey\u2019re really counting on me to get them through this, aren\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? I\u2019m not\u2014look at me! When I don\u2019t have a tail, I\u2019m not special. Frankly, now that the Folk have outed themselves and the world knows there are millions of people with tails, I\u2019m not special all over again. I\u2014I kind of liked that.\u201d Ironic: Madison only wanted to be seen. Fred wanted anything but to be seen.</p><p>Betsy shrugged. \u201cThe people around you would disagree. I\u2019ve been telling the ones around me that I\u2019m the poster child for Ordinary Citizens Who Happen to Be Dead, but they won\u2019t listen. I know we should be glad they see us as heroes, but I find it scary, sometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScary,\u201d Fred said, \u201cis the exact right word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUncanny, right? No matter how much I fuck up, the people who love me see me as important and competent and non-fuckup-ey. It\u2019s so weird and sad.\u201d</p><p>Fred snorted a laugh through her nose; she couldn\u2019t help it. Then they rounded the last corner and found Jonas and Madison in the custody of four more Polo Shirt Gangsters.</p><p>\u201cOh, look at this,\u201d Betsy said, trying to comb something black and viscous out of her hair with her fingers. \u201cIt\u2019s a whole rainbow of bad guys. The Skittles Gang.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe prof advises police and ambulance are rolling,\u201d Green Shirt said, putting his phone back on his belt.</p><p>\u201cThose are the magic words. Let\u2019s go,\u201d Red Shirt replied.</p><p>\u201cWhat about our guys?\u201d Other Red Shirt said.</p><p>\u201cFuck \u2019em. They were warned about the hybrid; if they were dumb enough to jump her without neutralizing her from a distance, they deserve all the months of traction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd also, the morgue,\u201d Fred said demurely. She\u2019d said it to gauge their reactions, and was rattled when none of the Skittles Boys so much as made a sad face. Great. Not just soldiers; committed men who value the team as a whole, not the individuals in the team. Maybe we\u2019ll really, really luck out and they\u2019ll be religious fanatics as well!</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Fred murmured to Jonas, who had the beginnings of a black eye.</p><p>\u201cSure. There were five of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you or Betsy or I should definitely kill both Red Shirts,\u201d he added darkly, glaring at both Red Shirts. \u201cTo let them live is spitting in the face of decades of sci-fi television fantasy tradition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, man. Are you sure you\u2019re straight and happily in love with a live woman?\u201d Betsy asked. \u201cBecause, seriously, you would love my zombie friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTempting,\u201d Jonas commented with a wry look at Fred, \u201cbut I\u2019ll pass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that I\u2019m complaining, because I\u2019m glad you\u2019re both alive, but why didn\u2019t you . . . uh . . .\u201d Signal there were bad guys around? Or run? Or scream for help so we wouldn\u2019t have just blundered right into you? Or something?</p><p>Through long acquaintance, Jonas knew what she was truly asking and shook his head. \u201cYou wanna go where they wanna take us, Fred, and right now. Trust me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She sighed. \u201cMore bad guys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd a doomsday device.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Fred nearly screamed.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, you heard me, an actual doomsday device. What\u2019s that black stuff all over your shoes? Toner from office garbage?\u201d he asked Betsy.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she nearly screamed.</p><p>\u201cYeah, you heard me.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER FOURTEEN</p><p>The Skittles Boys marched them silently and efficiently back to the NEA, not answering their questions or rising to their taunts. Since Jonas and Betsy were gold-medal taunters, that was something Fred found most ominous of all. Despite the balls-up at Faneuil Hall, it bespoke of the men\u2019s (and where were the Skittles Girls?) professionalism.</p> <p>As it was late, the area was nearly deserted. There were a few\u2014a very few\u2014people on the street, mostly coming late to the nearby hotel. Fred considered, and rejected, screaming for help. Doomsday device? Mermaids, vampires? Polo Shirts? Bad guys dressed like Skittles? If someone heard their cries and if someone took them seriously and called a cop and if Dispatch sent a unit, they\u2019d all still be inside the NEA by then, and nobody would be able to stop the bad guys, or save the good guys, in time.</p><p>Besides, Fred suspected what was happening inside was private Folk business. And possibly private vampire business.</p><p>Betsy\u2019s thoughts (such as they were) must have been along the same lines, as she suddenly piped up, \u201cWow, it\u2019s like a buddy movie crammed with the supernatural.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is not. For one thing, we have no lawful authority. For another, we live half a country apart (for which I will always be thankful). Also, I loathe you. Not buddy-movie loathing. I loathe you like famine. I loathe you like war.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t,\u201d the vampire replied with grating cheer. \u201cYour bitchiness is purely surface bitchiness. Inside you\u2019re like a big old gooey . . . I dunno . . . jellyfish? Help me out, marine biologist. A big old gooey glop of caviar? A big old\u2014Where\u2019d you get that?\u201d</p><p>Betsy\u2019s sharp digression startled everyone, but Other Red Shirt slid the key card through the lock without pause, and opened the door.</p> <p>Jonas turned to Madison, who\u2019d been silently (thank God) crying during the last of the walk. Orange Shirt (Betsy also referred to him as Sunkist) had impersonally collected their phones, and Madison, frightened at the thought of losing the line between her mother and herself, had clutched it for a few panicky seconds. Jonas had gently coaxed her into giving it up and had been holding her hand and murmuring comforting things like, \u201cAs fast as tech moves, it\u2019s actually gotten outdated since suppertime and you need to get a new one.\u201d Betsy had surrendered hers with a bit more grace: \u201cBut how will I know what the weather is in Istanbul? Or when my FB stats get updated? Or which restaurants deliver after midnight? Or how much Plymouth Rock weighs? Also, I occasionally use it as a telephone.\u201d</p><p>Now, watching the bad guys deftly get through the electric lock, Jonas cocked his head, puzzled. \u201cI thought you got your purse back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d Madison sniffed. \u201cJust the money was gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see.\u201d Betsy started counting off on her long fingers. \u201cBad guy conspiracy, check. Henchmen, check. Funding\u2014obvious from the uniforms and your cute matching phones\u2014check. Doomsday device, whatever the fuck that is\u2014check. Plan to steal NEA employee\u2019s key card without her knowing that\u2019s what you\u2019re doing\u2014check. Tech to copy keycard and return purse to further confuse said employee\u2014check. Plan to keep said employee and anyone she might call away from the fish warehouse\u2014check.\u201d</p><p>All night. We were sitting around all night making a list, for God\u2019s sake, when we could have been here, maybe putting a stop to this shit well before the bad guys expected us to show up.</p><p>\u201cI like you better when you\u2019re ditzy,\u201d Fred muttered, following her into the building.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the only one,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>\u201cYou mean they didn\u2019t want to kill me? They just rilly, rilly needed my ID and stuff to get in?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCheck,\u201d a new voice said, and they all looked around, and then down. \u201cAs if we could mistake the Fehr heir for a talking sardine.\u201d</p><p>A white man in his midsixties, sitting painfully straight in his wheelchair, rolled quietly toward them. He had long gray hair pulled back in a ponytail that, if free, would have reached down his back; his beard was short and carefully shaped, covering his upper lip and chin but none of his neck. He was wearing a crisp white dress shirt, black slacks rolled to show both legs were missing below the knee, and a navy blue tie embroidered with bright red peace signs. On the left armrest of his chair was a shiny green sticker: \u201cWhales are people, too!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, good God,\u201d Betsy groaned. \u201cSave me from aging hippies.\u201d</p><p>Fred, whose mother was one, said nothing, but smiled a little.</p><p>\u201cMy name is Hedley Ran and I don\u2019t know you,\u201d he told Betsy, and Fred noticed his back never touched the back of the wheelchair. \u201cOr you, sir.\u201d Dismissing Jonas with barely a glance. \u201cI know you, miss, through your insipid letters and lies. And I know your friend.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not Madison\u2019s . . . grrrr.</p><p>\u201cI will not speak with the fish,\u201d the old man said. \u201cSo you tell her for me, girl, tell her she and her school of friends are done. Because of me.\u201d</p><p>Jonas cleared his throat politely. \u201cSorry, just to clarify here so Madison can correctly pass on your message, did you mean school friends or school of\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a fish insult,\u201d Fred explained. She rolled her eyes at Hedley Ran. \u201cHe probably thinks he\u2019s being subtle. And so he is, compared to any of us. Which is still pretty unsubtle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell the fish I\u2019ll use her coworkers and her research and her beloved NEA to destroy her \u2018people.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe fish can hear you fine, and is fluent in English,\u201d Fred informed him. \u201cYou really think you\u2019re special, huh? You are not. You\u2019re just another bigot. There\u2019s a zillion of you: blacks, Asians, Native Americans, Folk, you\u2019ve always got somebody to fear and then to hate.\u201d She turned to her friends. \u201cI\u2019ve actually run into this before. Some of the idiots we\u2019re stuck sharing the planet with think that because the Folk have tails and scales, we\u2019re not human and, ergo, can be treated like pets instead of citizens. There\u2019s been talk of rounding us up and dumping us into concentration lakes.\u201d</p><p>Madison\u2019s eyes went wide and Jonas said, shocked, \u201cYou never told me that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I? It\u2019s awful enough that I know it; I\u2019d never bring you guys down with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t about bigotry,\u201d Ran insisted. \u201cIt\u2019s about the survival of our species.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, technically that could be construed as bigotry, depending on how you define survival and species,\u201d Betsy began, but he cut her off.</p><p>\u201cBefore they flaunted themselves before the world, I knew her kind of old. They were smarter to stay hidden, to be the monsters in our nightmares, the kind we think aren\u2019t real in the light.\u201d</p><p>Fred very carefully did not look at Betsy, who was a monster of nightmares people thought weren\u2019t real in the light.</p><p>\u201cI was born with two legs and when I married my wife I had two legs. Now I have none and my wife is dead and my unborn son with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God!\u201d She stared at the man, horror-struck.</p><p>\u201cTruly,\u201d he agreed, allowing himself a small grim smile. \u201cYou didn\u2019t know what kind of monster you took to friend, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe what I\u2019m hearing! Fred, you bitch, what have you done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Fred asked, having no idea where Betsy was going with this.</p><p>Betsy shook a finger beneath Fred\u2019s nose and asked, as stern as a spinster schoolmarm, \u201cDid you kill his wife and unborn son?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you promise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, Fred, we\u2019re in kind of a bad situation here.\u201d Betsy slung an arm around her shoulders and led her a couple of steps away from the group. \u201cListen, this is serious. This poor guy\u2019s got a real problem. We owe him the truth, so just tell it straight, okay? I promise, whatever you did, we\u2019ll deal with it. So. One last time: did you kill this man\u2019s wife and unborn son?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did not. I\u2019ve never seen him before tonight.\u201d</p><p>She sighed in evident relief and turned back to Hedley Ran, whose smile had dropped off like it had been slapped away. The Skittles Boys were helpless in the face of severe vampire sarcasm. \u201cThere, see? It\u2019s okay. Everything\u2019s gonna\u2014We can absolutely work through this. You don\u2019t have to worry: she\u2019s not the one who killed your wife and unborn son. Thank God, right? Total relief! Because that would have made for a super awkward work environment.\u201d</p><p>Fred was trying to lock the laughter in her throat, which was why she sounded like a water buffalo. Drowning.</p><p>\u201cIs that supposed to be your idea of a jest, young lady?\u201d</p><p>Quick as thought, Betsy dropped her bantering tone, and when she spoke, there was so much ice in her voice it made Fred shiver.</p><p>\u201cOf course it\u2019s not a jest, you bitter pathetic asshat. Fred\u2019s right, you\u2019re not special. You\u2019re just another bigot sitting around chanting about race wars and revenge because your life is shit and you don\u2019t know why so the plan you came up with was to hate people you\u2019ve never met. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s more amazing\u2014that you can fool yourself in the face of simple common sense or that you can infect other people with your insanity.\u201d She flapped a hand at the Skittles Boys, disgusted. \u201cBoston sucks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t blame the town!\u201d Jonas yelped.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s right, though, it\u2019s stupid to blame an entire race for something one person did.\u201d Fred spoke quickly, the better to get Ran\u2019s attention back on her and off Betsy (and so as not to dwell on the irony of Betsy doing what she denounced Ran for). She didn\u2019t know what the vampire was going to do, but assumed her rant was part of a plan. \u201cIf one of my people was even responsible.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAll of your people were responsible!\u201d</p><p>Fred blinked. Mission accomplished. His attention is definitely back on me. \u201cCare to elaborate? No, don\u2019t bother. I don\u2019t care, is the thing. I really don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you being this argumentative on purpose?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCount on it,\u201d Jonas said with a vigorous nod.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re trying to stall because you think people can find you via your cell phones, or if any of you think to slink away and call for help\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, hell no,\u201d Betsy said. \u201cAs a feminist, I hate calling for help. Plus it\u2019d ruin everything. I\u2019ve got a rep to consider.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not stalling.\u201d Fred was pretty sure that was true. \u201cWe\u2019re also not impressed. This\u2014whatever this is\u201d\u2014she waved a hand, encompassing Ran and his henchmen and the NEA building\u2014\u201cit all goes back to you thinking you\u2019re special. Not like anyone else. And see, it\u2019s a lie. I\u2019m not like anyone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m not like anyone else, either,\u201d Betsy whined.</p> <p>\u201cNot now, Betsy. You\u2014you\u2019re just an aging hippie with a superiority complex.\u201d</p><p>He opened his mouth but Fred cut him off. \u201cAdmit it. You think you can make decisions about hundreds of thousands of people because you\u2019re so uniquely superior. It\u2019s bad enough you really think you\u2019re special; what\u2019s worse is it\u2019s for the dumbest reasons imaginable. Because you\u2019re old but you have long clean hair. Because you need a wheelchair but you won\u2019t let yourself slump in it. And because in the sixties you thought unprotected sex meant you were deep, and bragging about a three-day booze-pot-shit fest in a field in New York State meant you actually did something. And you did do something: got high, and fucked in the shit. Not the mud. The shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWoodstock was the defining moment of\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf shit. They ran out of food, they ran out of water, they ran out of places to shit. Okay? Three days of starving and shitting. Women had miscarriages there, do you get that? Babies died at Woodstock but you\u2019re all still bragging about it like it was a plan. Like it was a good idea. You were right about one thing, though: Woodstock absolutely did define a generation.</p><p>\u201cYou Baby Booming idiots did one thing, one thing, to get yourselves noticed: a whole bunch of you got born between 1946 and 1964. And . . . that\u2019s it. That\u2019s what you did. And it\u2019s not even what you did. Your parents came home after driving Hitler to suicide and they all had simultaneous sex and then you guys were born. You\u2019ve been coasting on your parents having simultaneous sex for going on seventy years.\u201d</p><p>Fred was starting to see little black spots blooming before her eyes, evidence of a Type Three Shitfit. She staggered a little and Betsy reached out to steady her. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy mom . . . was at Woodstock . . . and is a hippie . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know . . . you just don\u2019t know how awful it was . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do now. You should write children\u2019s books. L\u2019il Foxy and Friends Catch STDs While Fucking in Woodstock Shit. Like that.\u201d</p><p>Hedley Ran had simply waited in his chair through Fred\u2019s rant, his pale cheeks getting more and more flushed. His posture improved, which she hadn\u2019t thought was possible. The Skittles Gang stood around waiting for orders, and Ran, when he saw she was done, obliged: \u201cKill her friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMadison . . .\u201d Is not my friend, Fred was about to say, when Red Shirt Two produced a pistol from somewhere and shot Betsy in the chest.</p><p>CHAPTER FIFTEEN</p><p>Fred had never been prouder of her friends in her life (except Madison wasn\u2019t her friend). Their eyes widened, yes. Madison sucked in a breath; Jonas leveled a long stare of contempt at Ran. They didn\u2019t scream. They didn\u2019t cry. They didn\u2019t beg for their lives.</p> <p>So, of course, she took her example from theirs, and simply looked at Hedley Ran the way a picnicker looks at a line of ants marching toward Potato Salad Hill: annoying, but no real threat. To Fred\u2019s intense pleasure, Ran was the one who seemed shaken and shocked.</p><p>The Skittles Boys were worse off, pale and sweating and their gazes darted here and there; none of them could settle on any one thing to look at. Betsy\u2019s crumpled body? Noooo. Madison\u2019s pale, sorrowful face, Jonas\u2019s contempt? Her own scorn? No and no and no.</p><p>\u201cOh, starting to sink in?\u201d she asked. \u201cIt\u2019s real, boys. This isn\u2019t Final Fantasy XXXVVIII. That?\u201d She pointed to Betsy\u2019s body. \u201cThe state of Massachusetts calls that felony murder and they get pissy about it. That\u2019s life without parole, and it\u2019s on all of you. I assume you\u2019ve all got good lawyers on retainer? A cheap one in this town charges five hundred an hour.\u201d She had no idea what a lawyer, cheap or otherwise, charged, but five hundred sounded pricey. Their blanched expressions told her the shot had hit, hard. \u201cI\u2019m sure Ran here will happily foot the bill. Get it? Foot the bill? Because, in case you can\u2019t tell, he\u2019s got no feet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou see,\u201d Ran said quietly. \u201cIt cares nothing for its friends. It\u2019s not human, and it\u2019s wrong to treat it as one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who isn\u2019t human,\u201d Madison said quietly. She had cried silently, helplessly\u2014but had stayed with them. Hadn\u2019t run or begged. Hadn\u2019t flinched away from the shot, from Betsy going down. \u201cShe didn\u2019t even know me and she wanted to help. You won\u2019t ever understand that kind of thinking. My mother tried to tell me about people like you.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m not a good listener.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, cunt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Fred seized Madison\u2019s wrist and pulled her behind her, shoving a pissed Jonas back with the other hand along with an I\u2019ve-got-this glare. \u201cYou\u2019ve got us all here, you\u2019re getting what you wanted. There\u2019s no reason to talk to her like that when you could be calling me a cunt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Jonas spoke out, still hovering protectively near Madison. \u201cFred\u2019s used to it; call her the cunt, the whore, the bitch, the shrew, the witch, the tart, the twat, but leave Madison alone!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Dr. Bimm. And, uh, Jonas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy friends call me Fred, so you\u2019d better start, Madison. There. There! You see what you\u2019ve done to me?\u201d she cried to the man in the chair. \u201cYou\u2019ve made me befriend Madison Fehr! You evil bastard!\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough of this.\u201d If Ran had been rattled earlier, he was getting himself back under control now. \u201cWe need to do the test and get rid of the witnesses, then move the device. In that order.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be the doomsday device?\u201d Fred asked. \u201cWhen you\u2019re not blaming strangers for your wife\u2019s death and committing felony kidnapping and murder, do you sit around in your wheelchair watching old spy movies? Doomsday device. Christ.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will work,\u201d he insisted, answering Fred but speaking to Jonas. \u201cTell it to have no fears on that account.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFred, Ran says his machine\u2019s gonna work and not to worry about it or anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have tolerated its presence here long enough, hers and the other fish she takes to mate. Now is the reckoning I promised my wife, and it isn\u2019t the only one who will suffer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFred, Ran says he\u2019ll get you, and your little dog, too.\u201d</p><p>She could have laughed to see confusion chasing anger across Ran\u2019s face. He can\u2019t understand. He\u2019s got guns and thugs and a doomsday device and he\u2019s sure we\u2019re in his power and he can\u2019t understand why we will not take him seriously. And he never ever will. And that\u2019s the funniest fucking thing I\u2019ve heard all day.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t laugh when it works,\u201d he hissed, rattled into speaking directly to Fred. \u201cDoubting my design is a mistake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll work, Dr. Ran. I\u2019m absolutely certain your Doomsday Device will work. No problem there; your doomsday device is going to be a mechanical marvel. That\u2019s not the issue with your doomsday device. I\u2019m not worried about whether or not the doomsday device you\u2019ve no doubt spent years building will work. I\u2019m concerned about your doomsday device because it\u2019s . . . you know. A doomsday device.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt can make all the mockery it likes,\u201d Ran began.</p><p>\u201cThanks. You look embalmed. What\u2019s worse is I suspect this is actually a good day for you. And you still look wretched. She\u2019s dead.\u201d Pointing at the \u201ccorpse.\u201d \u201cAnd she looks a lot better than you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that.\u201d Ran looked down. \u201cThrow that in the tank.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich one?\u201d Fred asked, honestly interested. Let\u2019s see, there are over seventy separate tanks on the main level alone, not counting\u2014</p><p>\u201cThe big one, of course. The one we need for the test.\u201d</p><p>Fred didn\u2019t like the sound of that at all.</p><p>CHAPTER SIXTEEN</p><p>Betsy\u2019s dead body went in with the inevitable splash, and they all watched it sink. Fred thought she certainly looked dead, and from Jonas and Madison\u2019s expressions, they thought so, too. Pale, blanched. Blood-stained shirt. Eyes frozen open and staring, drifting down and down and down. Please be alive, you Minnesotan blond bloodsucker; I would be losing my shit for real if I thought you were truly as dead as you looked.</p><p>\u201cGet on with the speech.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Hedley Ran asked, again startled into answering her directly.</p><p>She folded her arms across her chest and shook her head. \u201cOh, come on. You haven\u2019t gone to all this trouble, making nice with Madison to trick her out of her key cards and rounding us all up in here and dropping sly little hints you think are subtle about your doomsday device and going on about how I\u2019m not human and will pay the price, blah-blah, you haven\u2019t set all this up to not tell me all about your evil genius plan and how we\u2019ll rue the day we killed your wife, except no one in this building, and I\u2019m betting no one in this state, had anything to do with that, but what are mere facts to a mad scientist?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ran ignored mad scientist. \u201cWe needed your friend, yes. When my research was complete and the device was built, we needed a test site. The NEA was perfect for a number of reasons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a miniature ecosystem. It\u2019s a small, controllable version of what you want to do on a large scale,\u201d Fred said glumly, \u201cso it\u2019s the perfect test site.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes,\u201d Ran said, taken aback.</p> <p>\u201cWhatever you\u2019ve built is going to do something to the oceans that won\u2019t thoroughly wreck the planet. Poison that doesn\u2019t affect landers, or high-secrecy sound waves, or . . . anything that will kill the Folk without killing the planet for who\u2019s left.\u201d She rubbed her forehead. \u201cBut you don\u2019t dare just unleash it on the world. Not without testing it first. Test it here, make sure it works the way you want, and at the same time you can destroy the building which housed the evil fish bitch who killed your wife and unborn son, except I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlso wiping out all the witnesses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d Ran shrugged modestly.</p><p>Fred stared into the tank. For years, those fish and reptiles and mammals had been her responsibility. She kept a close eye on them, gauged their health, kept track of what they ate, noted any illnesses or unusual deaths. Yes, they could be a pain in the ass. Yes, she knew they disliked her and thought she could be more accommodating to their needs for \u201980s glam rock. But they were living creatures, they had feelings and fears and, if they had to live in captivity, she could at least make sure they were safe.</p> <p>No matter how much they annoy you, no matter how big a pain in your ass they are, you\u2019re in it, Fred.</p><p>Great. Now she was hearing the vampire in her head.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d she shouted, startling Ran so much that he slumped for a second. \u201cNobody kills off those little jerks but me! And since I wasn\u2019t planning on it, you don\u2019t get to, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t stop it,\u201d Ran snapped. \u201cThe device is wired into the building\u2019s power grid. I control the device, and my men control\u2014\u201d</p><p>Even though Fred had been expecting something, her heart still lurched when the lights went out.</p><p>CHAPTER SEVENTEEN</p> <p>There were muffled sounds of a struggle, and she wasn\u2019t sure where the gun was, and Fred had less than a second to decide. So she dived at the source of all evil, and knocked Madison Fehr out of what she feared would be harm\u2019s way. This only happened because we have an intern program at the NEA. Interns are the source of all evil. I have decided.</p><p>She\u2019d expected the shot but was still aghast at their stupidity\u2014she could barely see, so she knew damned well Ran and his Skittles couldn\u2019t see at all.</p><p>And their decision is to shoot? They could just as easily hit each other!</p><p>\u201cJust stay down,\u201d Fred said, and heard Madison\u2019s affirmative gasp. Not that the poor girl could move; Fred was sticking to her like sand on feet, reasoning that she could tolerate a bullet far better than Madison. Hell, she hadn\u2019t known fianc\u00e9 number two even a month before he\u2019d had to dig a bullet out of her shoulder. Betsy\u2019s right: getting shot sucks. Maybe if we stay flat enough, I won\u2019t be.</p><p>Fred\u2019s eyes had adjusted, though she knew the others were still blind. Jonas had somehow gotten to a Skittles Boy in the dark and incapacitated him, but now was standing, uncertain and trying to see.</p><p>\u201cGet your ass on the floor!\u201d she hissed. Stupid brave dumbass gentleman! These were just the sort of people who could get her killed. \u201cDown, down! All the way down, FLAT! Now don\u2019t move!\u201d</p><p>He obeyed at once, knowing she could see, but being Jonas, it wasn\u2019t in him to let the screaming go by. \u201cSay it, don\u2019t spray it,\u201d he muttered to the tile, and Fred snickered.</p><p>Then she saw what was coming up behind Hedley Ran, and the laugh stuck in her throat.</p> <p>It was Betsy, dripping wet and pissed, Betsy who had somehow swum up the side of the tank after floating along the bottom for fifteen minutes. Betsy had not only swum to the top unmolested by the sharks, but had slithered up and out of the water and over the side of the tank without making a sound, which Fred would have thought impossible, because moving water made noise. Still, the vampire had done it: she\u2019d not only gotten out and gotten down, but she came up behind Ran, jerked him out of his chair, bent over him, and\u2014</p><p>Ran screamed.</p><p>Once.</p><p>CHAPTER EIGHTEEN</p><p>The power came back on with non-dramatic ease. No flickering, no fumbling. No sinister bomb countdown. One second, they were trapped in the dark with a vampire, and then they were trapped in the light with a vampire.</p><p>He said the device was tied to the power, but someone cut the power. Now the lights are back on, which is either wonderful or terrible.</p><p>Betsy was standing over Ran\u2019s body, his blood smeared from her lips past her throat, her blood all over the front of her shirt. Ran looked like a pile of trash someone had crumpled and tossed.</p><p>\u201cYou guyth okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDepends,\u201d Fred muttered, rolling off Madison and standing. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with your voice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. I thwear!\u201d At Fred\u2019s glance, she shrugged. \u201cMy fangths come out when I feed, thmell blood . . . like that. Taketh a minute to go back.\u201d</p><p>Fred started to laugh. A tension releaser, for sure; it had been a stressful evening. \u201cBut that\u2019s so absurd! It\u2019s the least suave sexy cool thing I\u2019ve ever heard! TV vampires don\u2019t lisp!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019th not my fault. Don\u2019t laugh, it\u2019th a real problem,\u201d she complained.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Fred gasped between giggles. \u201cSo sorry!\u201d She steadied herself and snorted one last giggle. \u201cSorry. Ask me how much I needed that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay it twice. I\u2019m not gonna lie.\u201d Betsy\u2019s eyes were bright and her cheeks flushed. She looked beautiful, despite (because of?) the blood. Vibrant. Alive. If there was still a bullet hole in her chest, Fred couldn\u2019t see it. The tear, yes. The hole, no. \u201cI\u2019ve been dying to do that for the latht half hour.\u201d</p><p>I laughed because it\u2019s one thing that makes her seem less sinister. It\u2019s okay. She\u2019s a good guy. If she wanted us dead, there were only a million opportunities. She saved us. It\u2019s all right.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pleased you are pleased, my own.\u201d</p><p>Fred screamed. She\u2019d had no sense of the man, no sense. But he was there, as if conjured by a wish. Some of the most intense fight-or-flight impulses lit up her nervous system and she realized she\u2019d jerked back from him without realizing she\u2019d moved.</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon,\u201d Betsy\u2019s insane husband said, and inclined his head in a polite nod. \u201cI meant to reassure, not startle.\u201d</p><p>Startle? I\u2019m startled when I stub my toe. You did not startle me.</p><p>\u201cPerfect timing, babe,\u201d Betsy announced, stepping over Ran without looking.</p><p>\u201cThe timing was yours, Elizabeth.\u201d Betsy\u2019s insane husband went to her and dropped a light kiss on her blood-splattered cheek. Casual as the kiss was, he was looking her over with care, as if to reassure himself she wasn\u2019t hurt. \u201cAs we decided, if you didn\u2019t call me at a certain time, I was to create a diversion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo wonder you didn\u2019t care if they took our phones.\u201d Jonas hadn\u2019t screamed, but he was very pale and kept his distance from both vampires.</p><p>\u201cSee?\u201d Fred cried, looking around the room. Two of the Skittles had killed each other in a cross fire. Jonas had knocked the other one out. Sinclair must have tackled Sunkist on his way in; Orange Shirt was unconscious, and his left eye was blowing up like a bike tire. Betsy, of course, had rid the world of Ran. \u201cThis! This is why you don\u2019t fire a gun when you can\u2019t see anything. Idiots!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucky for us,\u201d Jonas said.</p><p>\u201cLucky? It could have been one of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I said. Lucky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I just say,\u201d Betsy began, wiggling from her insane husband\u2019s embrace, \u201chow awesome there\u2019s no reason to talk to her like that when you could be calling me a cunt was? I also like how you told him he looked embalmed. Tomorrow it\u2019ll really be true.\u201d She threw back her head and laughed. Her insane husband watched her with a fond smile, but Fred noticed Madison and Jonas didn\u2019t find it quite as hysterical.</p><p>\u201cThank you for helping us, sir.\u201d Madison came forward and held out her hand. While they shook, she continued. \u201cWe owe you and Betsy more than we can pay back.\u201d</p><p>Fred was impressed; she might have been able to say the words, but probably wouldn\u2019t have sounded so unrattled. \u201cShe had you tucked up her sleeve, Mr. . . . uh . . . Other Vampire?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. His devastating good looks almost made her forget her momentary terror. He\u2019d seemed large and forbidding outside on the sidewalk. Here at the top of the Giant Ocean Tank, he was a dark giant. Suit, shoes, eyes: deepest black. \u201cMy queen occasionally finds me useful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t think I\u2019d come to town with the king and not have him skulking nearby? Also I didn\u2019t have a choice; he was gonna do that anyway. I\u2019ve spent years trying to get him to quit with the protective skulking. Finally I just started to use it to my advantage.</p><p>\u201cMy love is a quick study,\u201d Sinclair replied, and Fred could hear the laugh lurking in his voice.</p><p>\u201cLater for you, buster.\u201d Betsy glanced back at the corpse she had made of an elderly cripple. \u201cSo the doomsday thing won\u2019t work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot after what I did to it.\u201d Another thin smile. \u201cI am a layman at best when it comes to science, but it was clear to me he was onto something. I\u2019d like to call in some experts to have a look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr we could smash it to little bitty pieces of doomsday,\u201d Fred suggested. She had no idea what it would have done or how it would have worked, and never wanted to find out. Whatever it was, it needed to disappear. Today. Forever.</p><p>\u201cAs you say. And if the queen agrees.\u201d</p><p>Oh ho.</p><p>\u201cI bet it would have worked. Like Dr. Bimm said, that wasn\u2019t the problem. It was one thing to assume he was nice because he wrote nice e-mails and then find out he\u2019s bad,\u201d Madison said, lower lip trembling. \u201cI\u2019m not that stupid; people lie. They lie all the time; that\u2019s something my mama never had to tell me. But he had all these great ideas. He couldn\u2019t lie about the science, and he had these rilly, rilly smart ideas . . .\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah, he did. But intelligence and goodness don\u2019t always go together. Just ask any of my friends,\u201d Betsy added with a smile.</p><p>\u201cYou are too modest, my own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s really got that tall, dark, and mysterious thing down, huh?\u201d Jonas commented. Fred was amazed; it hardly ever took him that long to rejoin a conversation.</p> <p>\u201cHey.\u201d Betsy pointed at him. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to be into anyone I know, you\u2019re gonna be into my zombie friend. We\u2019ve talked about this, Jonas!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaving found such utter bliss in her own marriage, my queen tirelessly seeks to foist marital bonds on others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo not.\u201d Betsy took in the carnage again. \u201cWhat are we supposed to do with this mess? Tell me nobody could hear the shots from outside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo chance.\u201d Fred shook her head. \u201cThe place is as good as soundproofed. But we should talk about calling a cop. Or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all. Of course my queen and I will attend to this; why should you and yours be further inconvenienced?\u201d Sinclair said it so smoothly, it was obvious he was used to hiding commands inside questions. \u201cThe police will be of little help but will inconvenience and/or incarcerate everyone in this room.\u201d Another sliver of a smile. \u201cWe have schedules to keep. All of you do, I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p> <p>Jonas and Fred looked at each other. \u201cWe\u2019re breaking the law if we don\u2019t,\u201d she warned.</p><p>\u201cYep. But Tall, Dark, and Terrifying has a point. What can the cops do except make it more complicated and awful? It won\u2019t be the first time we\u2019ve all agreed to keep something quiet.\u201d</p><p>Jonas had her there; he was referring to her murdering her father, and a few other things he was too tactful to bring up in front of strangers.</p><p>\u201cYou have people who can take care of this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve heard of cleaners? Our cleaners have cleaners. They do great work; they\u2019ll treat the NEA right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen . . . I guess we\u2019re done.\u201d Was it possible? It was too much to hope for.</p> <p>\u201cPerhaps not quite. Come here, dear.\u201d He crooked a finger at Madison and she took a slow step forward. \u201cI cannot pretend to understand the ordeal you have endured, but I can promise\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t! Please don\u2019t spell me.\u201d Madison had thrown her arms over her face and backed off. Alarmed, Fred started to go to her but stopped when Jonas grabbed her arm and shook his head. Wait, he mouthed, and she did, but if she had to get between Madison and the guy capable of stealing her mind, she would. The thought of enduring another brain invasion left her cold and shaking, but the thought of standing by and letting Madison endure one was unthinkable.</p><p>\u201cChild, I meant no\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I want to forget,\u201d Madison said to her arms. \u201cI\u2019d give almost anything to forget, and people died! And people I rilly care about almost died because I\u2019m stupid. I\u2019m gonna have bad dreams about tonight forever. About Betsy getting shot and dumped in the tank, and Dr. Ran, and Fred squishing me in the dark so she\u2019d get hurt but not me, and being squished knowing you were all in danger and that it was my fault. And I\u2019ll dream about Betsy drinking Ran\u2019s blood, too, and you, too, sir, I\u2019m sorry, but I will, I\u2019ll have nightmares about you. You\u2019re scary.\u201d She slowly lowered her arms and gazed up at him. \u201cBut I earned those nightmares. We lived through this and it was terrible and those memories are mine. It\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s not for you to decide it\u2019s too much for me.\u201d</p><p>Whoa. Fred\u2019s own eyes were wide; never had she respected Madison so much, nor been so ashamed of her own petty snobbery. Again: Who\u2019s the actual idiot, Fredrika?</p><p>Sinclair took a courteous step back. He was probably unaware, but it had seemed as if he\u2019d been looming over Madison. \u201cMy apologies, child, I only meant to reassure. Of course they\u2019re your memories and your dreams; I am not a thief. Pass that on to your lady mother, if you will.\u201d</p><p>Madison kept darting quick looks at him, then glancing away, then back. Fred realized she\u2019d probably learned Vamp Etiquette 101 from the cradle. \u201cTh-thank you. I didn\u2019t mean to say you were a thief. I\u2019m . . . not handling this well. Dr. Bimm will tell you I\u2019m not very\u2014\u201d</p><p>Fred shook her head. \u201cNot true, Madison. Not even a little bit true. You\u2019re handling this better than me, that\u2019s for sure. And it\u2019s Fred, dammit.\u201d</p> <p>The younger woman beamed, all fright forgotten. \u201cI\u2019ll never forget that you helped me, Dr. Bimm. You would have taken a bullet for me. You squashed me to save me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds awful; don\u2019t ever save me, Fred,\u201d Jonas said with fervent relief. \u201cIsn\u2019t she both heavy and weirdly bony?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s almost like we\u2019re rilly, rilly sisters!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are not! Just knowing you is awful. We\u2019re friends, and I am horrible to my friends, just so you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe speaks the truth,\u201d Jonas added.</p><p>Madison beamed. \u201cI know you\u2019re exaggerating, just like a real sister would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA real sister couldn\u2019t be worse, now shush.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSisters are worse,\u201d Betsy muttered, and Sinclair chuckled. \u201cDon\u2019t get me started.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m sure yours is the embodiment of all evil and despair.\u201d Did the vampire queen have to try and one-up her on every little thing?</p><p>\u201cWell . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cShush.\u201d Fred was gratified to see Betsy hush. She held out a hand for Betsy to shake. \u201cI\u2019m grateful for what you did. What you both did. We are all, I\u2019m sure.\u201d She glanced around; saw Jonas and Madison nod. \u201cYes, you\u2019re terrifying and spend far too much time talking about shoes, and you tend to appear out of nowhere like death in a designer suit, but it\u2019s all worth tolerating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwww. I feel all soft and mushy inside now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI myself less so. Still, your sentiments are appreciated. Perhaps we could meet again in a more official capacity?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean an official meeting of Undersea Folk and vampires? Stranger things have happened. Especially tonight. Look, I just want to get home and draw myself a nice bleach bath and scrub myself bloody and then get drunk and have the first of many nightmares about tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds good to me, too,\u201d Jonas announced. \u201cMadison, come home and crash with me. We\u2019ll get to whatever\u2019s left to square away tomorrow. Barb won\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Madison was shyly thrilled. \u201cThat\u2019d be\u2014you won\u2019t mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Course not. After what we\u2019ve endured? Vampires and Fred and doomsday devices and Fred and Ran and Fred and Skittles attacks and Fred?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate you both,\u201d Fred announced, and saw at once they were unmoved by her pronouncement. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll get back to the hotel and take my bleach bath. But Betsy . . . a personal question? Please?\u201d Even after what she had seen that night, she still couldn\u2019t fathom how such a thing could have happened. \u201cHow exactly did you get to be queen of the vampires?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, it\u2019s boring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a long story, and I come off shrill and bitchy in it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo? Pleeeease? I never wheedle. You\u2019ve got to tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBottom line, the vamps were ready for a change. And the change was me. Took me a while to see it, though. Anyhoo, they were talkin\u2019 \u2019bout a revolution\u2014\u201d</p><p>Fred groaned. \u201cIs that Tracy Chapman? Or The Who? And it\u2019s generation, not revolution. If it\u2019s The Who.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, you asked for the gory details; don\u2019t cry about it when you get them. So like I was telling you, we\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSinclair; he wasn\u2019t insane then, he didn\u2019t go insane until a few months ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cResponsible pet ownership is not insanity,\u201d the king announced in a tone that scared everyone but Betsy, who flicked her hand like what he said was a fly. \u201cAnyway, we decided the old king sucked, got a bunch of rabid vampires to eat him alive, and then had sex in the deep end of a pool and emerged victorious fanged monarchs. To sum up: the king is dead. Long live . . . me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Fred said in a small voice.</p><p>That nice smile again and there was the midwestern easy-going blonde who said bar-er instead of bar and hey there, then! for hello and such a deal! for that\u2019s a good price. \u201cYou asked,\u201d the nice blonde killer reminded her.</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly the really bad guys died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I guess it worked out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it did. Aren\u2019t you glad for me, Fred?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t look glad,\u201d she teased.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a little terrifying sometimes.\u201d</p><p>Betsy laughed. \u201cYou\u2019d be amazed how often I hear that these days!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t, actually.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER NINETEEN</p><p>\u201cWe just . . . left them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Jonas said.</p><p>\u201cWe knew what they would do. They\u2019re vampires, for God\u2019s sake. And we just left them there. To be eaten\u2014the two still alive.\u201d Fred took a breath, forced it out. \u201cTo be killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s bad that I don\u2019t mind more,\u201d Fred worried. \u201cI know I should feel shitty. I should be wringing my hands and wishing we\u2019d put a stop to it. But I can\u2019t make myself get upset over it. They shot Betsy\u2014they had no idea she\u2019d get up again. They were going to kill all of us. And then all the Undersea Folk. I\u2019m\u2014I\u2019m glad they\u2019re getting eaten!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we\u2019re on the same page.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to hell,\u201d Fred predicted with a sigh.</p><p>Jonas slung an arm across her shoulders. His other arm was around Madison, who was so tired she was almost sleepwalking. Occasionally he\u2019d steer her around a post or street light. \u201cAt least you\u2019ll be burning for eternity with people you know,\u201d he teased. \u201cAnd at least you\u2019ve seen the last of the vampire queen. Unless you decide it\u2019s time to bridge the gap between the Folk and the undead.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t joke about that. Bad enough to put up with two of them. I\u2019m so glad this night\u2019s over . . . I\u2019m so glad they\u2019re going home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon. They weren\u2019t\u2014Okay, he was fucking terrifying, but she was pretty cool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say she wasn\u2019t pretty cool; I said I\u2019m glad they\u2019re going home. I kind of like her,\u201d she said with reluctance. \u201cAll most people want to do when they find out who I am is stare and ask silly questions about mermaids granting wishes or how I deal with pruned fingers. Betsy\u2019s so self-involved, she doesn\u2019t care about any of that. With her it\u2019s all cut to the chase so I can go home and catch the Macy\u2019s sale.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo you like her because she\u2019s self-involved?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally self-involved. To an astonishing degree. It must be one of her powers.\u201d</p><p>Jonas shook his head. \u201cNo, I get the feeling she was like that in life, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but I think in un-death she hides behind it a little. She\u2019s not as ditzy as she seems. I . . . guess that\u2019s a good thing.\u201d</p><p>For her? Or for us? Fred didn\u2019t know, and was too exhausted to care. But when she\u2019d slept a while she\u2019d give the matter more thought. Betsy Taylor had been the most terrible wonderful person she had ever met. Or the most wonderful terrible person. It wouldn\u2019t do to let such a person slip off her radar.</p> <p>Not at all.</p><p>Incomer</p><p>CHAPTER ONE</p><p>TEN YEARS EARLIER</p><p>She was happy she was born during the worst winter Massachusetts had seen in decades\u2014since 1994, the old-timers claimed. It wasn\u2019t an absolute, but a cub\u2019s first Change usually happened around their birthday. Which meant that in the thrill and passion and danger and chaos of her first Change, she didn\u2019t have to worry about running into any of the three million three hundred thousand tourists who flocked to Cape Cod in the summer and fall. Tourists didn\u2019t have much interest in Massachusetts in mid-January, even the ferociously rude ones.</p><p>More clams for meeeeeee, she thought gleefully, digging so hard the sand flew ten feet and hit hard enough to scratch glass (if there had been a glass sheet in the middle of the beach in the middle of January). The moon was full and soared above her, fat and white. The wind whistled off the Atlantic and chilled her, but not as much as it would have if she was down there in her tender pink skin and her pale hairless hands and her pale hairless feet.</p> <p>She wasn\u2019t! So that was good! There was a time for hairless hands and a time for efficient strong paws, and this was paw time.</p><p>Excited beyond words (literally), Lara dug and dug for her dinner, the hole already so big if she wasn\u2019t careful she\u2019d slip on shifting sand and topple into it. She was not known for her grace, on four feet or two. Wouldn\u2019t that be a funny thing for her Pack mates to see! Here is your future alpha leader, the one whose hairy butt is sticking out of that hole.</p><p>Ha!</p><p>Even if she didn\u2019t get her teeth on the clams, in the clams, the act of hunting for her dinner was intoxicating. She would decide when and what to eat! Not Mother! She would decide if it was clams or rabbit or both or neither! Not Mother! She would blow off erosion concerns and decide how many holes to dig on the beach! Not the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution! She was thirteen; she wasn\u2019t a baby cub anymore. Those decisions should be hers, but her mother was sooooo stubborn. She was even stubborn about being stubborn. Double stubborn!</p><p>She can\u2019t even Change, she\u2019ll never Change, but Mother decides? It\u2019s wrong-bad.</p><p>But that was awful; worse, it was disloyal and mean. Her mother hadn\u2019t been born to the Pack, but that was okay. She and Lara\u2019s father had met on an elevator, and conceived Lara on that elevator, and that was okay; that was life in the big city. Her mother was the alpha female and, thus, the full fat moon of Lara\u2019s days, if not her nights, and that was . . . sorta okay. Lara would owe Mother respect all the days she was the alpha female, and all the days after, when Lara herself was. And she wouldn\u2019t be for years and years and years and years and years, and it would be years-long, it would be years-forever before she would lose her.</p><p>Thoughts for thinking later. So many smells. Salt and wet and grass and rot and fish and cold and wood and a thousand others, each one begging to be followed to its source, each one calling her like chimes bringing her to church. She would keep digging for supper. No, she would run down the dead fish up the beach. No, she would dig. No, she would flush rabbits from the deep green lake of grass. No, she would dig. Why was she digging again? Oh. Supper-food.</p><p>A seagull who thought he had dibs swooped above her and dived, then pulled up at the last instant. He soared above her and dived again, all the time scolding, scolding. Lara lunged straight up and her teeth snapped shut a bare inch from the gull\u2019s left leg, startling it in midcall: Khee-khee-kheeaa\u2014kheeaaaawwwwppp!</p> <p>Almost got you, gull-bird! More of that if you get too close! Might get you next time, might! Why was I digging\u2014oh. Right.</p><p>There had never been a more wonderful night in the history of forever.</p><p>She was a lucky, lucky cub. She lived in a magnificent stone castle with a red roof, a castle with a mile of grass in front and a bazillion miles of the Atlantic behind. There were hundreds of windows she could peek out of, windows so big and wide that no matter how little she was, she could stretch up and peek out: at two, at four, at five, at seven, at ten, at twelve, now.</p><p>It had many outdoor rooms where she and her Pack could eat or rest or eat, and even cook in the rooms and then eat in them, outdoor rooms protected from all but the yuckiest elements, outdoor rooms\u2014</p><p>She knew that was wrong; groped for the right word. She remembered almost everything on four legs that she\u2019d experienced on two, but interpreted the events differently. So it took her a few seconds for the association to\u2014porch! The castle had many porches. And three little oceans inside. Pools!</p><p>If she couldn\u2019t be in her wolf form all the time, it was nice to have a castle to run amok in the rest of the month. And the castle was stuffed with people, generations of relatives and friends and friends of friends; the Pack always tried to live together if territory would tolerate the numbers. Solitary living was death-pain for them.</p><p>Then she saw him, and was glad.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure why watching the inlander watch her made the night even better. They weren\u2019t friends; they didn\u2019t know each other except to nod hello. They couldn\u2019t: his litter was made up of people who chose to live far from the bulk of the Pack; she didn\u2019t know how they bore it.</p><p>He\u2019d know who she was, of course, but the poor cub couldn\u2019t Change. Horrid legacy from the witch. Not his fault, but the other cubs disagreed. On wonderful, wonderful nights like this, he could only watch; never join. It was a sad, unlucky thing.</p><p>She was sorry for him but glad for herself. All her good luck\u2014the castle, the rank, the Change\u2014made his bad luck, his inlander luck, seem worse. She was selfish enough to be glad it wasn\u2019t her, and sorry enough that it was him.</p><p>She was glad he was there now. She thought she\u2019d want to go through her first Change alone, and until that moment, she had. But being able to share the experience, even for a few moments, made it better. Did you see I almost got that noisy-stupid-smelly gull? Do you see how wide and wonderful-deep my hole is? She felt they had a connection, she and this neighbor she rarely saw and did not know.</p><p>They stared at each other across the beach for a second-hour-eternity, and then he raised a hand to her and continued on his way, and she went back to digging for her supper.</p><p>The clam was so sweet and delicious she didn\u2019t mind the sand in her teeth.</p><p>CHAPTER TWO</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re mad I\u2019m not dead, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Lara Wyndham, Pack leader of the Wyndham weres for nineteen hours, groaned and rubbed her eyes. Her toe throbbed from where she\u2019d stubbed it before sitting at the table. \u201cOf course not, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Michael Wyndham shook out his newspaper. His actual newspaper, paper and ink and circular ads and everything\u2014how quaint! \u201cI\u2019d be mad I wasn\u2019t dead.\u201d</p><p>Given that her father took the Pack to avenge the murder of his father, that was something to think about. \u201cYou\u2019re such a nutter.\u201d She stared down into her bowl of grits with butter and four slices of crumbled bacon. Normally she\u2019d be unable to resist such a soupy, bacon-ey, buttery delicacy, but the thought of wolfing (heh) anything besides a cup of tea brought on faint nausea.</p><p>Which was, she knew, stupid. It was also a huge giveaway to her folks that something was wrong. So she seized her spoon and started to eat.</p><p>Her mother slouched into the kitchen, yawning and going straight to the sideboard to grope for a coffee mug. She was dressed in her even-though-it\u2019s-Thursday-I\u2019m-dressing-like-it\u2019s-Saturday-morning outfit of jeans and a long-sleeved flannel shirt, although the temp was supposed to hit thirty degrees that day. With the Atlantic in their backyard, her mother often went around shivering.</p><p>Jeannie Wyndham\u2019s curly blond mass was streaked with gray (\u201cBattle scars, right up there with stretch marks.\u201d), and the laugh lines around her blue eyes had deepened over the years, but there was no way around it: her mother was, as several of her friends, male and female, had pointed out, \u201cso mega-hot she\u2019s absolute zero.\u201d (Thank God, thank God that when the remarks got back to her mom, she had no idea what they meant.) Back in the day they\u2019d have called her a cougar. Lara preferred Mother or You make me so . . . arrgghh!</p><p>She stirred her hot chocolate and thought again that it wasn\u2019t easy, having a legend for a mom. Oh, and one for a dad, too. Definitely to be filed under \u201cThings To Deal With: Not Easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, big day.\u201d Jeannie was heavily creaming and sugaring her coffee, which she\u2019d poured into a mug the size of a flower pitcher. \u201cFeel any different?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTired.\u201d She had not slept well; she hadn\u2019t for days. She didn\u2019t mention this to her parents. The thought of the chat that would ensue (\u201cMommy, Daddy, I\u2019ve been having nightmares; I\u2019d like a nightlight and for you to tuck me in with lullabies and toast. Lots of toast. A bed isn\u2019t a bed without crumbs. Also I keep dreaming about Derik\u2019s son even though I don\u2019t really know him.\u201d) made her shiver. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure it bodes well, if you\u2019re already tired,\u201d Michael teased. He, like her mother, was aging well. Unlike her mother, he was Pack, and Pack always aged well; it was written into the genetic code. There were grandfathers on the Cape who occasionally got carded. (\u201cWe card everyone, though,\u201d was not reassuring to a species trying to stay beneath the radar.) There was no gray in his deep brown hair, and not many lines on his face. Only his eyes changed with age: their startling gold color\u2014like Baltic amber, like old coins\u2014deepened each year. Her mom good-naturedly complained it was like staring into a road hazard sign.</p><p>It was a good life, and her parents were smart enough or humble enough to know it. They looked great, they were rich, they had decades ahead of them, their cubs were grown (\u201cNote we didn\u2019t say out of the nest, because they\u2019ll never leave.\u201d), and so Michael and Jeannie Wyndham were doing something no alpha couple in the two-million-year history of the Pack had done.</p><p>Retiring.</p> <p>CHAPTER THREE</p><p>SIX YEARS EARLIER</p><p>\u201cBut we don\u2019t do that. Alphas don\u2019t retire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can. We just haven\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMike\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI hate when you call me Mike.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014I say this with love and respect and as your best bro and as someone who has killed for you and would probably die for you, probably: you\u2019re out of your fucking mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI also hate when you come into my house long enough to raid my larder, tell me I\u2019m insane, goad my daughter into ever more juvenile delinquency, speculate on whether you\u2019d die for me or not, and then . . . whoosh! Off to cause chaos somewhere else. You\u2019re like a blond Loki.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCompletely thoroughly out of your fucking mind. Do I smell brownies? And when\u2019s Lara get home? I might die for you. I\u2019m almost positive I probably would.\u201d</p><p>Lara nearly tripped over one of the benches for joy as she came in through the mansion\u2019s east entrance. It was her favorite, because that side of the mansion saw high traffic. The people who lived there\u2014her parents, her little brother, herself, other Pack members, assistants, cooks, and people who worked there (cleaners, drivers, gardeners, etc.)\u2014avoided the north door because of the incredibly polished (read: slippery) front hall and intimidating (read: old, four-foot-circumference, about eight-thousand-dollars-per-prism) chandelier that loomed overhead.</p><p>Thus the east entrance was cluttered, with muddy floors and dirty windows and boots in winter and tennies and sandals in summer and things hanging on hooks and beach towels laid out on benches to dry and a half-full bag of birdseed slumped in a far corner (though they had no bird feeders), a partially deflated basketball, two bottles of plant food, a small baggie filled with Phillips Head screws and a flat-head screwdriver, and sand everywhere, everywhere. \u201cIt\u2019s too big to be a mud room,\u201d was the general joke, \u201cso it\u2019s the mud wing.\u201d</p> <p>Though her father was on the north side of the mansion, she could hear and smell him, and better yet, she could smell Derik Gardner, her father\u2019s best friend and worst enemy. So she dumped her overstuffed backpack on a bench that was already groaning with beach towels, swim shoes (heedless of damage to paws on all fours, Pack members were oddly fastidious about getting their pink hairless feet dirty), and umbrellas (though it hadn\u2019t rained in three weeks). Then she unslung her purse from around her neck, tossed the purse by the backpack and the car keys on the purse, and wasted not one more moment.</p><p>She hurried through the long halls, past enormous windows overlooking the grass ocean and wood so old and tended so long it was black with age and polish buildup. Her home smelled as it always did, a delightful mishmash of Pack members and food and furniture polish and dust and hunger and love.</p><p>She burst into the main hall beyond the north door and instantly slipped. Both feet went up in the air, but from long experience, she tucked and saved the back of her head from a teeth-rattling rap. A startled grunt (\u201cNnnnff.\u201d) was forced out of her, but that was okay because Derik heard her coming and\u2014</p><p>\u201cJeez, how many times, Lara? Seriously. Before you get bored or die?\u201d</p><p>\u2014knew she\u2019d be sprawled on the floor. \u201cHiya!\u201d she cried, holding up a hand. He pulled her to her feet with an effortless tug and she threw her arms around him. \u201cYou never call, you should have said you were coming, you never do and I could have skipped school!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t, actually,\u201d her father said from the doorway to the north receiving room, but he was smiling.</p><p>\u201cWhy would you assume I\u2019d have any interest in spending time with you?\u201d His hug belied his words. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t know myself we were coming.\u201d</p><p>A lie. But one told in kindness. Derik had alpha tendencies, but the Pack already had one. Rather than give in to instinct and tradition to fight his best friend to the death, orphan his children, and make a widow of Jeannie, Derik had left the Cape. Sometimes he came back and stayed for months; sometimes he dropped in for an overnight and was gone by dawn. At no time did he courteously call ahead. It was a deliberate slight to the Pack leader, but Derik was so well loved, Michael let it go and would hear no words against his friend. \u201cWe have forty bedrooms. We have a kitchen so large it can feed a small country, and the food supplies to go with it. What\u2019s the problem? Are you afraid he\u2019ll have to sleep on a couch and hose himself down in the side yard, and eat crackers for breakfast? Or fall over the kitchen cliff when he\u2019s looking for the bathroom in the middle of the night?\u201d</p> <p>(The kitchen cliff was the steep bank about thirty meters from the kitchen porch, which due to the design of the mansion and the placement of the Atlantic ocean, led straight down to the water. So if you hated what was on the breakfast menu, you could theoretically walk out the kitchen door and kill yourself.)</p><p>\u201cWhy d\u2019you think Dad\u2019s out of his mind this time?\u201d She followed them into the receiving area, a large room splashed with sunlight and furnished with sofas and chairs that were as comfortable as they were elegant. The hardwood floor gleamed (thus the slipping) and the many rugs, supposedly hauled over on the Fortune, which landed at Plymouth Colony about a year after the Mayflower, were Savonneries and worked in deepest blues and golds and greens.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d tell you, except it\u2019s so weird you won\u2019t believe me.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cIs it the retirement thing?\u201d</p><p>Derik sighed and glanced at Michael. \u201cUnless he\u2019s discussed the subject with his heir like a sensible madman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s for sure sensible. If Dad retires and I\u2019m Pack leader, can you come back and live here for good?\u201d</p><p>Derik\u2019s blond brows arched and her father frowned. \u201cLara. Absolutely none of your business and inappropriate besides.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, but can you?\u201d She knew she could push things with her father; he expected her to be aggressive and not easily backed down. They all did. But she also knew there were limits. \u201cDerik? And your wife and cub, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . . don\u2019t know, hon. I hadn\u2019t thought about it. Your dad just now sprung this on me.\u201d He glanced over her head at her father. \u201cI hope\u2014Michael, I hope that wasn\u2019t a factor in you coming up with this idea. The problem\u2019s mine, not yours. The Pack\u2019s yours until you\u2019re dead; we all know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just something Jeannie and I have been kicking around. She\u2019s got fresh perspective, something I lack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s not all you lack,\u201d Derik said cheerfully, his momentary concern gone with the wind. Derik\u2019s moods were weathervanes, and it was always windy. \u201cBut I don\u2019t have that kind of time; you\u2019ll have to think up your many thousands of shortcomings on your own. Meantime, you and Jeannie want to join Sara and me for dinner? No kids, though. I can\u2019t stand yours, and mine can\u2019t stand me.\u201d</p><p>Another lie, Lara figured\u2014hoped, at least. Derik\u2019s son was so quiet and introspective\u2014a radical departure from both parents\u2014it was hard to picture him hating anyone.</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of,\u201d Michael said, his head cocked to the left in what her mother teasingly called his Petey the Dog expression. They all heard the polite one-rap knock, and then the door opened and Jack Gardner stepped into the entry.</p><p>He saw them at once and inclined his head. \u201cSir,\u201d he said to her father. \u201cMiss.\u201d To her. \u201cCaptain Weirdo.\u201d Derik.</p><p>\u201cThis is why I knocked up your mother?\u201d Derik mock bitched. \u201cTo be hung with humiliating nicknames?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would be nice\u201d\u2014Jack sighed\u2014\u201cif we could go one entire day without you saying knocked up and mother and hung in the same sentence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Michael and Lara,\u201d her father said, \u201cyou\u2019re practically family, Jack; you must know it.\u201d His tone was light, but Lara knew he was a little taken aback at the teenager\u2019s formality. And maybe a little hurt, too; none of the Wyndhams saw as much of the Gardners as they would like. To be treated as a stranger by the son of the man he considered a brother was hard. \u201cMy God, you\u2019ve gotten huge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was gonna tell Lara the same, but simple self-respect prevented it,\u201d Derik said. \u201cIt\u2019s so embarrassing; I hear myself saying all the stupid things that annoyed me when adults said them to me: Look how you\u2019ve grown. You\u2019re a young man already. When I saw you last, you were only yea big. Don\u2019t eat that; I dropped it on the floor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe golden days of childhood\u201d\u2014Michael sighed\u2014\u201cgone forever. And you still eat things off the floor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t judge me.\u201d Derik sniffed. \u201cFloor jerky is perfectly good, as is floor bread and floor yogurt. We don\u2019t all eat off gold plates, y\u2019know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to see you,\u201d Jack soberly told her. \u201cYou get prettier all the time, which I always think is impossible, and then you top yourself.\u201d All said in the tone of a boy reading a computer printout.</p><p>\u201cIt took you that long to think of something to say?\u201d Lara teased. Often he didn\u2019t speak at all after nodding hello. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI was just waiting for a break in the Michael and Derik show.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOooooh, torched you! That\u2019s my cub,\u201d Derik said proudly. \u201cAlways so\u2014hey! Mock him, not me.\u201d</p><p>Lara had been studying Jack since he\u2019d come inside. She knew he was a couple of years younger than she, but he had such a serious mien he seemed older. The fabulous gray eyes helped; they seemed to change given his mood: from smoky fog to dirty ice, depending. His hair color came from both parents, dark golden blond with rich red lowlights, thick and lustrous; it fell across his forehead in waves, almost into his eyes. He had his mother\u2019s milk-pale complexion; not a freckle in sight. Jack was that ghostly hue all year around, which, when he visited, caused no end of teasing (\u201cHey, Jack, I can see you, and when I close my eyes, I can still see you.\u201d).</p> <p>Yes, he\u2019d always been a cute kid, but adolescence was giving him something . . . she didn\u2019t know . . . presence? She wasn\u2019t sure, but assumed she found him so striking because she didn\u2019t see him very often. She figured it was because she saw him with fresher eyes as opposed to the other boys, who, if they didn\u2019t live in the mansion, lived within five miles of it. They rode buses together and went to the same schools together and got along and fought and argued and pranked together. Jack seemed above it all because he was apart from it all; it was refreshing.</p><p>What the . . . Pull it back, Lara! He\u2019s only fifteen! He\u2019s just a kid, she thought with the worldly wisdom of a nineteen-year-old girl. It\u2019s a little creepy to find him sexy.</p><p>She should leave. Quickly. Packers lived, fed, fought, fucked, and died on their instincts, all their instincts. Even though the poor guy couldn\u2019t Change, he might have some or most or all of the other senses. He might be able to pick up on her (inappropriate) interest.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to leave now,\u201d Jack murmured.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, me, too, but it was\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was nice to see you again, Lara. I\u2019ll wait for you, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, bye!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood-bye.\u201d</p><p>Jack practically ran back to the front door, while Lara lurched through the entry, trying not to slip on the shiny floors. The last thing she heard before she got clear was Derik\u2019s, \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d</p><p>She could almost hear her father\u2019s shrug in response. \u201cTeenagers.\u201d</p> <p>CHAPTER FOUR</p><p>Michael Wyndham, former Pack leader now embarked on his first full day of retirement, stared down at the shredded bat at the kitchen entrance and thought, This does not bode well.</p><p>His mind ticked over the possibilities.</p><p>1) Some cat (or dog or possum but likely a cat because cats were weird) got ahold of the bat, somehow, ripped it up a little, then got bored with it and left it on the front porch because it had pressing business to be weird somewhere else.</p><p>2) Some cat (or dog or possum but likely a cat because cats were weird) got ahold of the bat, somehow, ripped it up a little, then left it on the front porch as some kind of sick-ass present, the sort of thing weird cats got off on when they weren\u2019t shitting in boxes.</p><p>3) A Pack member was sending a message.</p><p>4) A non-Pack member was sending a message.</p><p>5) The bat, fed up with the state of the world, killed itself by flying through a fan or food processor or whatev y\u2019like and then managed to drag all its bits and pieces to the kitchen step, a sort of, \u201cWoe, mankind and Pack, let this be a warning; the bell tolls for thee!\u201d</p> <p>Michael rubbed his eyes, eyes people alternatively found fascinating or unsettling, and thought, Oh, please let it be number five. But of course it couldn\u2019t be. The idea was absurd: if the bat truly wanted to kill itself, it would have folded its wings and dived over the kitchen cliff.</p><p>He raised his voice\u2014it was after breakfast, Sean would finally be up but Lara would be out and about, and Jeannie had another meeting of her No, Really, Erosion Is Erasing the Cape! Club. \u201cSon? C\u2019mere and give me a hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cArgh,\u201d was the reply, muffled because the speaker was no doubt into his second pound of bacon. \u201cIt\u2019s the crack of eleven thirty, Dad; let a guy get his eyes open, will ya?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, Sean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNnnnf. Gnnff. Rrowwllff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to\u2014\u201d he began, but his son had appeared in the doorway leading to the steps. \u201cTo eat all the bacon at once; it\u2019ll still be there after you help me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a lie and you know it,\u201d Sean Wyndham informed him. His mouth was actually shiny with bacon grease. \u201cI take no chances ever since BaconGate. And what\u2019s the\u2014oh.\u201d Sean looked down at the pile o\u2019 bat shreddings. \u201cJeez, Dad, I feel bad. I didn\u2019t get you anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust hush and help me clean this up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever the bat did to piss you off, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s very sorry now. It was between you and the bat and it\u2019s over. You need to put it behind you. I think it\u2019s inappropriate to bring anyone else into your and the bat\u2019s private business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, boy.\u201d He sighed, alternatively wanting to hug and throttle his only son. \u201cAnd help me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can manage one of those,\u201d he decided. \u201cShutting up or helping. You pick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSean . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlus the new guy\u2014Len? Lenny? He\u2019s starting today, right? I almost tripped over him on the way out here. He\u2019s looking for something to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSean.\u201d</p><p>Sean bitched good-naturedly through the ordeal, as Michael had known he would. But he was a cheerful helper, lightening an unpleasant task with his constant stream of witticisms, as Michael had also known he would.</p><p>There were times he caught himself staring at Sean, amazed that someone so unlike himself could come from . . . well . . . himself.</p><p>It was repulsive to compare children to one another, mentally toting up their faults and fine points like they were living ledger sheets. But sometimes he couldn\u2019t help it: Lara was like him\u2014and his father\u2014in so many ways, and in what few ways she wasn\u2019t, she was like his beloved Jeannie. It meant the three of them had frequent arguments and power struggles, which only increased as Lara got older, and occasionally there were threats of death and mutilation (not necessarily in that order) when, say, report cards came out, or Lara decided there was no need to wreck the car and tell her parents. I can manage one of those was practically a Wyndham family slogan.</p><p>The retirement announcement, Derik and his family returning to show their support, and the tension were all relentless reminders that his whole experiment would not have been possible without Lara . . . and Derik. And the truth was, he had starting mulling over the possibility two decades ago.</p><p>CHAPTER FIVE</p><p>TWENTY YEARS EARLIER</p><p>Michael Wyndham stepped out of his bedroom, walked down the hall, and saw his best friend, Derik Gardner, on the main floor headed for the front door. He grabbed the banister and vaulted, dropped fifteen feet, and landed with a solid thud he felt all the way through his knees. \u201cHey, Derik!\u201d he called cheerfully. \u201cWait a sec!\u201d</p><p>From his bedroom he heard his wife mutter, \u201cI hate when he does that . . . Gives me a flippin\u2019 heart attack every time,\u201d and couldn\u2019t help grinning. Wyndham Manor had been his home all his life, and the only time he walked up or down those stairs was when he was carrying his daughter, Lara. He didn\u2019t know how ordinary humans could stand walking around in their fragile little shells. He\u2019d tried to talk to his wife about this on a few occasions, but her eyes always went flinty, and her gun hand flexed, and the phrase hairy fascist bastard came up, and things got awkward. Werewolves were tough, incredibly tough, but compared to Homo sapiens, who wasn\u2019t?</p><p>It was a ridiculously perfect day outside, and he couldn\u2019t blame Derik for wanting to head out as quickly as possible. Still, there was something troubling his old friend, and Michael was determined to get to the bottom of it.</p><p>\u201cHold up,\u201d Michael said, reaching for Derik\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI want to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care what you want,\u201d Derik replied without turning. He grabbed Michael\u2019s hand and flung it away, so sharply Michael lost his balance for a second. \u201cI\u2019m going out.\u201d</p><p>Michael tried to laugh it off, ignoring the way the hairs on the back of his neck tried to stand up. \u201cTouch-ee! Hey, I just want to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going out!\u201d Derik moved, cat-quick, and then Michael was flying through the air with the greatest of ease, only to slam into the door to the coat closet hard enough to splinter it down the middle.</p><p>Michael lay on his back a moment like a stunned beetle. Then he flipped to his feet, ignoring the slashing pain down his back. \u201cMy friend,\u201d he said, \u201cyou are so right. Except you\u2019re going out on the tip of my boot, pardon me while I kick your ass.\u201d</p><p>This in a tone of mild banter, but Michael was crossing the room in swift strides, barely noticing that his friend Moira, who had just come in from the kitchen, squeaked and jumped out of the way.</p><p>Best friend or no, nobody\u2014nobody\u2014knocked the alpha male around in his own . . . damned . . . house. The other Pack members lived there by his grace and favor, thanks very much, and while the forty-room house had more than enough room for them all, certain things were simply . . . not . . . done.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t start with me,\u201d Derik warned. The morning sunlight was slanting through the skylight, shining so brightly it looked like Derik\u2019s hair was about to burst into flames. His friend\u2019s mouth\u2014usually relaxed in a wiseass grin\u2014was a tight slash. His grass green eyes were narrow. He looked\u2014Michael had trouble believing it\u2014ugly and dangerous. Rogue. \u201cJust stay off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou started it, at the risk of sounding junior high, and you\u2019re going to show throat and apologize, or you\u2019ll be counting your broken ribs all the way to the emergency room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome near me again, and we\u2019ll see who\u2019s counting ribs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDerik. Last chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCut it out!\u201d It was Moira, shrieking from a safe distance. \u201cDon\u2019t do this in his own house, you idiot! He won\u2019t stand down, and you two morons\u2014schmucks\u2014losers will hurt each other!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Derik said to the woman he (usually) lovingly regarded as a sister. \u201cAnd get lost . . . This isn\u2019t for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting the hose,\u201d she warned, \u201cand then you can pay to have the floors resealed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMoira, out,\u201d Michael said without looking around. She was a fiercely intelligent female werewolf who could knock over an elm if she needed to, but she was no match for two males squaring off. The day was headed down the shit hole already; he wouldn\u2019t see Moira hurt on top of it. \u201cAnd, Derik, she\u2019s right, let\u2019s take this outside\u2014ooooof!\u201d</p> <p>He didn\u2019t duck, though he could see the blow coming. He should have ducked, but . . . he still couldn\u2019t believe what was happening. His best friend\u2014Mr. Nice Guy himself!\u2014was challenging his authority. Derik, always the one to jolly people out of a fight. Derik, who had Michael\u2019s back in every fight, who had saved his wife\u2019s life, who loved Lara like she was his own.</p><p>The blow\u2014hard enough to shatter an ordinary man\u2019s jaw\u2014knocked him back a full three steps. And that was that. Allowances had been made, but now the gloves were off. Moira was still shrieking, and he could sense other people filling the room, but it faded to an unimportant drone. Derik gave up trying for the door and slowly turned. It was like watching an evil moon come over the horizon. He glared, full in the face: a dead-on challenge for dominance. Michael grabbed for his throat, Derik blocked, they grappled. A red cloud of rage swam across Michael\u2019s vision; he didn\u2019t see his boyhood friend, he saw a rival. A challenger.</p><p>Derik wasn\u2019t giving an inch, was shoving back just as hard, warning growls ripping from his throat, growls that only fed Michael\u2019s rage\u2014</p><p>(Rival! Rival for your mate, your cub! Show throat or die!)</p><p>\u2014made him yearn to twist Derik\u2019s head off, made him want to pound, tear, hurt\u2014</p> <p>Suddenly, startlingly, a small form was between them. Was shoving, hard. Sheer surprise broke them apart.</p><p>\u201cDaddy! Quit it!\u201d Lara stood between them, arms akimbo. \u201cJust . . . don\u2019t do that!\u201d</p><p>His daughter was standing protectively in front of Derik. Not that Derik cared, or even noticed; his gaze was locked on Michael\u2019s: hot and uncompromising.</p><p>Jeannie, frozen at the foot of the stairs, let out a yelp and lunged toward her daughter, but Moira moved with the speed of an adder and flung her arms around the taller woman. This earned her a bellow of rage. \u201cMoira, what the hell? Let go!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t interfere,\u201d was the small blonde\u2019s quiet reply. \u201cNone of us can.\u201d Although Jeannie was quite a bit taller and heavier, the smaller woman had no trouble holding her back. Jeannie was the alpha female, but human\u2014the first human alpha the Pack had known in three hundred years. Moira would follow almost any command Jeannie might make . . . but wouldn\u2019t let the woman endanger herself, or interfere with Pack law that was as old as the family of Man.</p><p>Oblivious to the drama on the stairs, Derik started forward again, but Lara planted her feet. \u201cQuit it, Derik!\u201d She swung her small foot into Derik\u2019s shin, which he barely noticed. \u201cAnd, Daddy, you quit, too. Leave him alone. He\u2019s just sad and feeling stuck. He doesn\u2019t want to hurt you.\u201d</p> <p>Michael ignored her. He was glaring at his rival and reaching for Derik again, when his daughter\u2019s voice cut through the tension like a laser scalpel.</p><p>\u201cI said, leave him alone.\u201d</p><p>That got his attention; he looked down at her in a hurry. He expected tears, red-faced anger, but Lara\u2019s face was, if anything, too pale. Her eyes were huge, so light brown they were nearly gold. Her dark hair was pulled back in two curly pigtails.</p><p>He realized anew how tall she was for her age, and how she was her mother\u2019s daughter. And her father\u2019s. Her gaze was direct, adult. And not a little disconcerting.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Shock nearly made him stammer. Behind him, nobody moved. It seemed nobody even breathed. And Derik was standing down, backing off, heading for the door. Michael, in light of these highly interesting new events, let him go. He employed his best Annoyed Daddy tone. \u201cWhat did you say, Lara?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t flinch. \u201cYou heard me. But you won\u2019t hear me say it again.\u201d</p><p>He was furious, appalled. This wasn\u2019t\u2014He had to\u2014She couldn\u2019t\u2014But pride was rising, blotting out the fury. Oh, his Lara! Intelligent, gorgeous\u2014and utterly without fear! Would he have ever dared face down his father?</p><p>It occurred to him that the future Pack leader was giving him an order. Now what to do about it?</p> <p>A long silence passed, much longer in retrospect. This would be a moment his daughter would remember if she lived to be a thousand. He could break her . . . or he could start training a born leader.</p><p>He bowed stiffly. He didn\u2019t show the back of his neck; it was the polite bow to an equal. \u201cA wiser head has prevailed. Thank you, Lara.\u201d He turned on his heel and walked toward the stairs, catching Jeannie\u2019s hand on the way up, leaving the others behind.</p><p>Moira had released her grip on his wife, was staring, openmouthed, at Lara. They were all staring. He didn\u2019t think it had ever been so quiet in the main hall.</p><p>Michael was intent on reaching his bedroom, where he could think about all that had just happened and gain his wife\u2019s counsel. He didn\u2019t quite dare go after Derik just yet\u2014best to take time for their blood to cool. Christ! It wasn\u2019t even eight o\u2019clock in the morning!</p><p>\u201cMikey\u2014What\u2014Cripes\u2014\u201d</p><p>And Lara. His daughter, who jumped between two werewolves with their blood up. Who faced him down and demanded he leave off. His daughter, defending her dearest friend. His daughter, who had just turned four. They had known she was ferociously intelligent, but to have such a strong sense of what was right and what was\u2014</p><p>Jeannie cut through his thoughts with a typically wry understatement. \u201cThis can\u2019t be good. But I\u2019m sure you can explain it to me. Use hand puppets. And me without my So You Married a Werewolf guide . . .\u201d</p><p>Then he was closing their bedroom door and thinking about his place in the Pack, and his daughter\u2019s, and how he hoped he wouldn\u2019t have to kill his best friend before the sun set.</p><p>CHAPTER SIX</p><p>Though the memory was years old, it still had the power to astonish him. From her earliest beginning, Lara had been as protective as she was aggressive; the only thing she feared was failing in her duty. Nothing else had the power to frighten her: she was too young and vibrant to understand death, never mind fear it, and she had been born into privilege and would never fear poverty or deprivation. Getting caught in a mistake or, worse, letting someone down . . . that had the power to make her tremble.</p><p>Sean, now. Humans said cut from a different bolt of cloth and the Pack said came from the wrong litter and both sayings summed up how you could adore and cherish someone not at all like you while also being utterly puzzled by them.</p><p>He would kill or die for Lara because she was just like him. He would kill or die for Sean because he wasn\u2019t.</p><p>SIX YEARS AGO</p><p>\u201cHey. Move.\u201d</p><p>Sean raised a hand to shade his eyes. He\u2019d wandered over to Nauset Beach; public beaches were a pain, but this one had waves today, which, for New England, was pretty much unheard of.</p><p>\u201cS\u2019up?\u201d he asked the three shadows. The sun was at their backs, and with the ocean racket and hollering little kids and squealing teenagers and bellowing moms (\u201cCurtis! I said don\u2019t go back in until you\u2019ve put on more sunscreen! Curtis! Do you hear me, young man? Get back over here right now! Curtis, do you hear me? You are gonna be red as a lobster and I\u2019m not gonna\u2014Curtis! You get back here! Get back here now and get some more sunscreen on! Curtis! Curtis Daniel Graham, you get back here! I am talking to you, young man! You get over here right now! Right now, I said! Curtis! If you don\u2019t get over here right now, Curtis, you will\u2014Curtis! Curtiiiiiiiiis!\u201d), he\u2019d never heard them come up. From their lack of neck, he assumed they were Riley, Jeff, and Geoff from the middle school football team. At twelve, Sean had no use for football teams or football players, and not much use for middle school. \u201cAre you trying to loom?\u201d He yawned. \u201cI\u2019m guessing you\u2019re going for loom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got a private beach, Wyndham.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d he admitted cheerfully. \u201cBut today I want the luxury of my private one and also the pain in the ass of this public one. Go away or I\u2019ll end up with a tan the exact shape of your head and shoulders, which will be weird for all of us\u2014pphhhmm.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d said \u201cpphhhmm\u201d because Riley had\u2014yep, he really had\u2014kicked sand in his face. The smallest of the looming trio, Riley had small, fast feet. \u201cReally?\u201d he complained. \u201cYou don\u2019t feel like a bad ad in a seventies comic book doing that?\u201d He spat out several grains. \u201cI know how this goes. All I need is a bikini\u2019d babe to lose respect for me because I didn\u2019t engage, and then I\u2019ll storm home and secretly embark on a weight-gain, weight-lifting regimen, and come back years later to find you and kick your ass. I dunno. That sounds like so much work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo how about you get the fuck outta here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I just got comfy. See?\u201d He pointed to what he was lying on. \u201cIt\u2019s my tanning secret: an authentic President Eastwood beach blanket circa 2016. Note his squinty expression, like Popeye with a kidney stone. His squint says, \u2018I\u2019ll keep you safe and will blow up any country that dares mock the U.S. of A., punk.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe never know what the fuck you\u2019re talking about,\u201d Geoff whined. Sean could tell by their tone and scents that they were frustrated bordering on bored; their body language just hadn\u2019t caught up. Their stance and scent broadcast their confusion: they were being all kinds of aggressive and Sean didn\u2019t much care.</p><p>Yep. He didn\u2019t. They\u2019d get bored and leave, and he didn\u2019t care; he\u2019d go back to sunbathing. They\u2019d stick around and harass him, and he didn\u2019t care; he\u2019d dish it back. (And nobody could outtalk Sean Wyndham.) They\u2019d step up the harassment and get physical, and he didn\u2019t care; he\u2019d hold his own, or decide they weren\u2019t worth physical exertion and go back to his private beach. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He. Didn\u2019t. Care.</p><p>It made bullying Sean Wyndham a nightmare.</p><p>\u201cIs it true your grandpa and your uncle both died of cancer this year?\u201d he asked with honest curiosity. Packers didn\u2019t get cancer. Geoff hadn\u2019t taken a break from snapping bras, handing out wedgies, or rolling up on beaches to pick fights with smaller kids, so it was hard to tell if he was in mourning or not. \u201cBecause I\u2019m sorry if it\u2019s true.\u201d And he was. Cancer sounded just awful. It was like hearing someone died of bubonic plague\u2014it was nothing you or yours had had to worry about for centuries, but it was still pretty bad news.</p> <p>Geoff\u2019s hands, which looked the size and texture of catcher\u2019s mitts, balled into fists. \u201cYou shut up about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, yes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFaggot,\u201d Geoff said, desperation clear in his tone. So: no sympathy today; all bullying activities will continue as scheduled. You had to admire the boy\u2019s stoic endurance.</p><p>\u201cCareful, or I\u2019ll tell my boyfriend on you and he\u2019ll kick sand in your urethra.\u201d Sean yawned and lay back down. \u201cDon\u2019t you guys have date-raping skills to bone up on? Get it? Bone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2014\u201d Jeff broke off and, even though his back was to the parking lot, Sean was downwind and knew why. \u201cUh.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNow you\u2019ll be sorry, A, B, and B-minus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Riley asked, just as Sean\u2019s father reached their little group.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeeeeeeere\u2019s Daddy!\u201d</p><p>His father glanced down at him. Sean waved up at him from his Clint Eastwood towel. \u201cI love that movie, The Shining,\u201d Sean said, apropos of nothing. \u201cThe third remake was the best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mom\u2019s been looking for you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cProbably because I stole her towel,\u201d he agreed.</p><p>\u201cAt least you\u2019re willing to confess your crime.\u201d His father stared across his son\u2019s sprawled tanning body at the would-be bullies. Even in faded, paint-stained cargo shorts, a T-shirt from Cap\u2019n Frosty\u2019s, and bare feet, his father cut a formidable figure. And Dad was old. Almost forty. He\u2019d prob\u2019ly need a cane soon. \u201cIs there a problem, boys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNuh-uh, Mr. Wyndham, we were just hanging out with Sean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmmm. I don\u2019t think I know any of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s A,\u201d Sean said, pointing to Riley. \u201cThat\u2019s B.\u201d To Jeff. \u201cThat\u2019s B-minus.\u201d To Geoff. \u201cB-minus had recent deaths in the family, so we\u2019re being nice to him. Right, B-minus?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d his father and B-minus asked in unison.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re exchange students,\u201d Sean explained. \u201cFrom a land far, far away. Their real names are too complex for my feeble American brain, so I\u2019ve given them letters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSean\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for stopping,\u201d he told the three boys, who were retreating as quickly as they could while trying to make it look like they weren\u2019t. \u201cSee? All gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSean\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Dad,\u201d he said kindly. \u201cI\u2019m not giving you their names. I handled it. It\u2019s fine. No need to pull a Godfather.\u201d</p><p>His father squatted beside him, yellow eyes intent on his face. \u201cYou\u2019ve got sand all over your mouth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got hungry while lying on Clint\u2019s face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSean! They rolled up on you, kicked sand at you, crowded you.\u201d</p><p>He put his sunglasses back on. \u201cI know the short-term memory of a preteen boy is horrifically short, but I did manage to remember the events of the past forty seconds, Dad.\u201d</p><p>His father pulled the sunglasses off to maintain eye contact. \u201cThey were challenging you for territory. People will do that your whole life and it\u2019s okay, it\u2019s how things are. I can help you with that. You\u2019ve got to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, Dad?\u201d Sean propped himself up on his elbows. \u201cI\u2019m three times as strong and five times as fast as they are. They only made the football team because I didn\u2019t bother to try out. Same with basketball, same with every organized sport ever. They think they\u2019re stronger than me and we know they aren\u2019t. So, what? Show them they\u2019re wrong? Put them in the ER for the rest of the afternoon? For what? To prove they didn\u2019t scare me? They didn\u2019t scare me.\u201d He wondered how to politely ask his father to keep lecturing him on the other side of his pilfered towel, where he wasn\u2019t blocking the rays. \u201cBesides, karma\u2019s gonna get them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to make your own karma, Sean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure you actually understand what karma is, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSean, you can\u2019t let people like that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cKids. Kids like that. Actually, asshats like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsshats?\u201d His dad sighed. \u201cYou\u2019ve been talking to Betsy Taylor again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly because you weren\u2019t home to take the call. Oh, and because she\u2019s an honest-to-God vampire! It\u2019s weird that I think she\u2019s so smokin\u2019 she\u2019s absolute zero, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s been eligible for Social Security for years, so, yes, it\u2019s weird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s Social Security?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA program President Fey had to\u2014we\u2019re getting off the subject.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre we? Huh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice try. But still,\u201d his father persisted, and Sean stifled a groan. The old man had the worst time letting go of a bone. Any bone. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to stand up for yourself or\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr they\u2019ll think I\u2019m a chicken? Do not care, Dad. At all. Or you will? I\u2019m not a coward, Dad, and it\u2019s enough that I know that. I don\u2019t need to waste one moment proving it to anyone, even you.\u201d Sean sighed and laid down, then sat back up. \u201cAll this\u2014it\u2019s the same again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re different. What all this means is, if someone did that to you, you\u2019d have to prove you were El Alpha Supreme-o and kick their asses and send them to the ER in garbage bags. And that\u2019s fine. But I\u2019m not you. I don\u2019t have to prove anything. Not even to you.\u201d Maybe, he thought, thinking of his big sister, who would not have been able to walk away from A, B, and B-minus, especially to you.</p><p>His father looked at him for a long time\u2014well, probably only a few seconds, but it felt like a long time. Finally he shook his head. \u201cSean, I don\u2019t understand you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay, Dad. I understand you.\u201d</p><p>And he smiled, not bounced out of countenance by anything that had happened in the last ten minutes. Or the last ten years.</p><p>And his father shook his head once more, and smiled back.</p><p>CHAPTER SEVEN</p><p>It had been a long day, Lara\u2019s first full day as leader. And it had gone all right, she thought. Well. She had no frame of reference, but no one died, no one wanted to fight, no one even wanted to raise their voice.</p><p>The full moon was three days away, and the Pack\u2019s territory was bursting. Often people who lived in other parts of the state/country/world would travel to the seat of power for their Change. Pack members who hardly ever got to see each other could kick back, relax, chase some rabbits together, maybe make a new friend and fuck on the dunes . . . good times. The moon, so enticing when she was full and fat, always went back on her crash diet, and Pack members back to their day jobs as accountants and Democrats.</p><p>Those who lived too far from Cape Cod, or didn\u2019t feel it necessary to fuck on dunes, would absolutely show up this moon of all moons to inspect a new Pack leader. So Lara\u2019s day had been filled with meeting and greeting and (she hoped) assuaging anxiety with her serene, responsible demeanor. Or at least a demeanor that said, Hey, things will be okay under the new regime, probably, I\u2019m pretty sure . . . Steak tartare, anyone?</p><p>(\u201cConfidence,\u201d her brother had teased her hours ago, \u201cthy name is Lara.\u201d Sheer self-respect demanded she put him in a head lock until their mother began shrieking that they\u2019d punch through the wall or stair banister again and threatened to go for her Beretta.)</p><p>Thank God for Sean. She knew her little brother\u2019s disinterest in all things aggressive, forceful, or hostile disconcerted their father and amused their mother to no end, but she\u2019d never been more grateful for their differences than this week. An Armageddon-esque comet could be rocketing toward Massachusetts, and Sean would swipe Mom\u2019s Clint Eastwood towel and lay out on the beach to watch it come in and kill them, possibly sucking down Bloody Marys by the barrelful.</p><p>\u201cHow can I have sired a beta male?\u201d her father had wondered once, years ago, when he thought Lara was farther away than she was. He\u2019d only dared bring it up when Sean was several states away on his annual camping trip with BabyJon Taylor, the vampire queen\u2019s brother/son hybrid. Who wasn\u2019t a baby, but that was by far the least weird thing about the Taylor pack. By far.</p><p>\u201cYou mean, how come your son isn\u2019t a raging, testosterone-stuffed, date-raping jackhole like his papa?\u201d her mother had asked with aggravating cheer. \u201cNot that we were even on a date when we first met, Mikey, if you\u2019ll recall correctly, and I can see by the way you suddenly can\u2019t look me in the eye that you do. Nothing like Wham, bam, sorry I knocked you up, now you gotta move to the Cape and raise cubs with me . . . What was your name again, ma\u2019am? to liven up a girl\u2019s evening. What a romantic you were, my love!\u201d\u2020\u2020</p><p>\u201cArgh. You made your point.\u201d Lara could hear the ruefulness in his tone, knew he was scrubbing his hands through his thick hair and, yes, avoiding eye contact with her mother. They would both kill or die for each other, but her mother maintained the lifelong right to tease her father about their first \u201cdate.\u201d \u201cOkay, so, of course, betas aren\u2019t all bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you mean\u201d\u2014Lara sucked in her breath, hearing the warning (and if she could pick up on it, her father could, too)\u2014\u201cbetas aren\u2019t bad at all.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes. Of course. That\u2019s what I meant. Yes. Yes. We need them, obviously. The Pack wouldn\u2019t survive without them. If it was all alphas\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d be fighting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAll the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d be fighting about when to fuck, or fighting about who to fuck, or fighting about where to fuck who and when, and in the meantime the rest of the Pack would have starved to death. It\u2019d be just, aarrggh, we\u2019re so hungry, please stop fighting for just a little while so we can take five minutes to hunt for\u2014gaakkk!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Michael choked back a laugh. \u201cThat\u2019s just right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, what? You\u2019ve got an alpha. You\u2019ve got something else. At least you and Sean can be in the same room without wanting to set each other on fire after twenty seconds.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat was an accident,\u201d he corrected her, \u201cand it had nothing to do with the Miniskirt Battle of 2020. And the firemen were able to save most of the wing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna indulge my inner Trekkie for a minute\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014and remind you of the IDIC. Infinite Diversity in Infinite Combination. Translation: you\u2019re a fortunate man in all things, if everyone was the same, it\u2019d be a nightmare of boredom, so shut your jackhole and kiss me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sounded different when Spock explained it,\u201d he\u2019d replied with a sigh, and then they weren\u2019t talking anymore, and Lara went back outside without her mom\u2019s Clint Eastwood towel, so they wouldn\u2019t know she\u2019d heard.</p><p>No, she didn\u2019t understand Sean\u2019s way of seeing the world, but she appreciated it. He was a blast of freezer air in August\u2014different and refreshing and weird. He tolerated things she couldn\u2019t: bullies and bullshit. And knew things she didn\u2019t\u2014how to go along to get along. Not for nothing did he graduate Best Storyteller and Best Shoulder To Lean On. He put up with a lot, and she didn\u2019t understand it but did respect it.</p> <p>(Also, she\u2019d tracked down every cowardly stinking shit-mouth bully who ever dared touch her brother and kicked their asses, from Dennis Linderman in preschool to Jeff Pedermahn in middle school to Maureen Chowton at high school graduation.)</p><p>Tonight, she knew Sean would rather be in Boston with their folks but had never so much as hinted at the possibility of making the trip with them, or meeting them later. She appreciated that, too.</p><p>So Lara meeted and greeted and her parents were not at the mansion, were deliberately not at the mansion. They\u2019d spent the afternoon and evening in Boston, doing their own meeting and greeting with Dr. Bimm and l\u2019il Dr. Bimm. Knowing how much Sean enjoyed l\u2019il Dr. Bimm\u2019s company, she made a mental note to invite Fred\u2019s pack to swim and sun and eat with them before summer disappeared completely. Once things settled. Because they would settle. They\u2019d better.</p><p>Dr. Bimm had to kill her own father to not take the Pack. So things could be a lot worse. She still wasn\u2019t quite sure what had brought such calamitous events about, had never gotten the whole story. Dr. Bimm would never talk about it, and l\u2019il Dr. Bimm hadn\u2019t even been whelped when it had happened. If her parents knew any of the deliciously gory-sounding details, they\u2019d never shared.</p><p>She gave herself a mental shake to get back to the present. Anyway. Her parents weren\u2019t there, but not because they doubted her. They\u2019d gotten themselves gone because they didn\u2019t want to be cornered for endless rounds of, \u201cSay, you\u2019re alive! So you could still be running things. We\u2019re glad you\u2019re not dead and no offense, Michael, but what the fuck were you thinking?\u201d Not that they could avoid it completely. But not being available for consultation on Lara\u2019s first day sent a powerful message.</p><p>(\u201cLara\u2019s agreed, I\u2019ve agreed, my mate has agreed. The decision has been made,\u201d her father said. He didn\u2019t add, And that\u2019s it, because this wasn\u2019t the movies, it was the Pack. And that\u2019s it was understood, and thus unnecessary to verbalize.</p><p>In other words, that\u2019s how it is, and if you don\u2019t like it, howl at the moon somewhere else.</p><p>\u201cThe other Wyndham family motto,\u201d Sean decided.)</p> <p>She\u2019d expected to spend the day without her parents but with several Pack members, many she\u2019d never met. She had not expected to miss three: Derik, Sara, and Jack.</p><p>Okay, the truth: she\u2019d missed one.</p><p>Where is he? she\u2019d wondered, shaking sweaty hand after sweaty hand. (She was almost positive the sweat wasn\u2019t hers.) This is kind of Pack history in the making and they haven\u2019t visited in two years. I know they\u2019re here now; they\u2019d never miss this. Why wouldn\u2019t they come over on my first day?</p><p>She didn\u2019t know. And suddenly being the leader wasn\u2019t such fun after all. Not that she\u2019d expected fun. She hadn\u2019t. But she\u2019d expected something.</p><p>CHAPTER EIGHT</p><p>Lara stared down at the dead fish on the kitchen stoop and thought, This does not bode well.</p><p>She went back inside, stubbed her toe on the doorway leading to the kitchen, and while absently rubbing her sore toe had a quiet word with Lenny, who promised to have a quiet word with Kara, the head of the kitchen staff. Then she scored the last cup of hot chocolate and sat back down at the breakfast table. That will teach me to wander down for a bite, think, Hmm, what smells like a dead fish? and then go find a dead fish.</p><p>Question: How did a kitchen full of Packers not smell a dead fish?</p><p>Answer: the Atlantic Ocean is about sixty meters from the kitchen door.</p><p>Funny how this was one of her favorite rooms, even when her folks were out of town. The room was big and bright, with lots of windows and light blond wood on the walls and the floor. The table was small, but the sideboard was almost as big, and groaning with food. Even though her folks weren\u2019t here, Sean was, and the kitchen staff planned accordingly.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t slept well, again, and was sure it showed: sweat pants, battered T-shirt, hair that had yet to meet a brush that morning. Her eyes felt like sand traps. Who cared? If Jack hadn\u2019t bothered to come around, what was the point?</p><p>Argh. That is not what I meant. I meant, a leader shouldn\u2019t spend enormous amounts of time wondering if she\u2019s pretty enough to receive. She just receives. Or not. Sweat pants or a Gucci gown, it\u2019s all about the girl wearing the clothes, not the clothes wearing the girl.</p><p>She pulled her iPad out of her robe and unfolded it until it was about 210 mm by 230 mm: the size of a standard piece of printer paper. Not that anybody used printers anymore. Some people liked to show off by not unfolding it any larger than a pack of cards, but Lara had never been a fan of eye strain.</p><p>Data immediately began to stream across it, but she had no interest in current events. She was stuck in the past, and wasn\u2019t sure why. Pack members weren\u2019t prone to introspection.</p><p>She was surprised she could be lonely in a household full of at least twenty people, day or night.</p><p>Is my father lonely, even with my mother?</p><p>He must be. And before now she had never wondered. She had never even thought of it. What else haven\u2019t I thought of?</p><p>Lara wasn\u2019t surprised she\u2019d had another stress dream last night. She\u2019d been having them on and off since her father had proposed his terrifying, unprecedented idea. Werewolf (oh, that silly name, but it saved time because everyone knew what it meant) dreams and stress dreams had two things in common: the dreamer wasn\u2019t aware they were dreaming until they awoke, and they were stressful. There was, of course, good stress and bad stress.</p><p>Guess which one I keep getting?</p><p>No, the surprise wasn\u2019t that she\u2019d had a nightmare. The surprise was that Jack Gardner was in it, was always in those dreams.</p><p>She had dreamt of him from earliest childhood; strange! She still didn\u2019t know him well. She didn\u2019t know him and . . .</p><p>. . . she was afraid of him. And again, had been from earliest childhood.</p><p>You\u2019re thinking about this to avoid thinking about your new role, about the dead fish, about the dead bat Dad didn\u2019t tell you about. It\u2019s chickenshit. She knew it. She wouldn\u2019t hide from it. Because it was also a matter of fear, and hiding from that? Also chickenshit.</p><p>She dreamed of him, but told no one\u2014not even Daddy, who she could tell anything. He might not love her as much if he knew she was a stupid scared cub.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t alone in that, either, which should have made her feel better but didn\u2019t. Some of the other cubs, they\u2019d expressed fear through anger and she wasn\u2019t sure they knew it.</p><p>When the adults were out of sight and smell, the other cubs would pick on Jack and bully him, and he\u2019d either hold his own\u2014he had their strength, if not their other gifts\u2014or retreat. Then he\u2019d be gone again, no one knew for how long, and it was funny how that just made the other cubs more afraid.</p><p>Their parents had a name for Jack Gardner, a name said with such distrust it sounded like a swear word: incomer.</p><p>She\u2019d never heard the word before. And they\u2019d almost . . . they\u2019d almost spat it. Like it was a swear, a really bad one.</p><p>So she borrowed her mother\u2019s old iPad, a clunker that didn\u2019t even fold, and looked it up. The definition didn\u2019t seem terrible. An incomer was someone who moved to a place he wasn\u2019t born. Heck, her mom was an incomer. So was Jack\u2019s mom. And Jack\u2019s dad, her dad\u2019s best friend. Derik had to take off and live entire months\u2014sometimes years\u2014in places her dad wasn\u2019t. Or they\u2019d kill each other. Not in the silly play-fights humans were so fond of (\u201cI can\u2019t stand that guy, I\u2019m gonna kill him, he took the last donut!\u201d). In an I\u2019m-afraid-I\u2019ve-killed-your-husband-but-I\u2019ll-make-sure-you-and-the-cubs-are-taken-care-of way.</p><p>That wasn\u2019t especially scary; that\u2019s how things were. Alphas were rare, and they didn\u2019t live together for long. Couldn\u2019t. So Jack being an incomer, that was okay. It wasn\u2019t scary or weird. Lara was so, so thankful her brother had zero interest in running the Pack, that she was the only alpha of her generation. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>So Jack was an incomer: so what? She looked up the antonyms, too; she knew from Miss Berrin, her least favorite English teacher, that antonyms could help you figure out strange words. So she checked out related words, and some of those were fine and some of them were scary, a little.</p><p>Refugee. Relocatee. Foreigner. Those words made it sound like an incomer had things done to them, things they couldn\u2019t help. Things that made her want to help them. Those words made her mad that the other cubs were being mean about Jack.</p><p>Migrator. Pilgrim. Pioneer. Those words made her proud that Jack was (sometimes) a neighbor. Lara had grown up less than thirty-three miles from Plymouth Rock. Pilgrims sought new challenges, wanted better lives for their families. Pilgrims braved hardship that would kill those who had stayed behind. Pioneer wasn\u2019t just a good word, a pioneer was brave and sought new territory so they and their cubs could have better lives; pioneers were to be respected and revered.</p> <p>Exile. Illegal. Alien. Those were scary. Those made Jack sound like he wasn\u2019t just different, but that he could do things to them. Pol Pot and Idi Amin were exiles. (Cubs learned early what humans were capable of doing to their own packs. If she hadn\u2019t seen the footage, she would never have believed they were capable of such utter insanity.)</p><p>Illegal made it sound like Jack was doing bad things, breaking Pack laws and other ones, too. And alien . . . that made it sound like he was strange and frightening and could do things no one else could.</p><p>Like his mother.</p><p>The sorceress.</p><p>The Pack was afraid of her, too, but that was a whole other thing, and it had nothing to do with why the Gardner litter had to move around so much.</p> <p>Usually when Lara researched something, even when she found out bad or scary things, she felt better for knowing. After looking up incomer, she felt worse.</p><p>\u201cThis is gonna sound weird given that if you fall out the right door in this place you\u2019re actually in the ocean,\u201d her brother announced, slouching down the stairs, \u201cbut what smells like dead fish?\u201d</p><p>Firmly back in the present (for the moment), Lara watched him come, amused enough to almost cheer up. Only Sean could make slouching an active verb. He was so laid back he almost came down the stairs lying down.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d she replied, \u201cit sounds weird. Is this the part where I pretend you\u2019re not down here to check on me because you and dad found the bat? Thanks for telling me, by the way. I know why Dad didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, he\u2019s weird like that, what with loving you and not wanting you to worry on your first day and hoping it was some dumb coincidence. He mentioned his suicide theory, and I have to say, I was skeptical. I\u2019m pretty sure that bat was murdered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMakes two of us.\u201d She stared into her cocoa. \u201cI guess whoever it is left it on the kitchen stoop because there are a zillion scents around here at any time, especially the kitchen area, and it\u2019s the busiest part of the house. It\u2019s risky because someone might catch you sprinkling bat bits on the front stoop, but if no one does see you, it\u2019s not likely to be discovered right that second so you\u2019ll have time to . . . I don\u2019t know. Get away? Get back to work? Is it supposed to scare me? I\u2019m more annoyed than afraid. I told Kara I\u2019d take care of the fish but she said not to worry about it. And I\u2019m really not.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s the spirit. And to answer your question, no, this is the part where I pretend you\u2019re not drinking the last of the cocoa, you heartless bitch. What?\u201d he yelped, scanning the sideboard. \u201cYou scarfed all the juice, too? Green tea? That\u2019s what\u2019s left? Why don\u2019t I just drink a nice cup of dirt? Huh? Is that what you want, Lara? For me to drink a cup of dirt? Will that make you happy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice try, but I\u2019m not distracted. Not much.\u201d She sucked down more hot chocolate with a loud slurp. \u201cAhhh! Nectar of the gods.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t blame you. People like us\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere we go.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014who turn into wolves once a month and rut and poop on beaches and dig through the garbage dump are not known for our subtlety.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d Lara smiled at him over her cup of delicious, delicious hot chocolate. \u201cWe\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo who\u2019s doing it? And why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExtrapolate, Holmes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo more word-of-the-day toilet paper for you. Listen, if somebody\u2019s pissed about you running things, they can just roll on up and Challenge you. Now is the best time: you\u2019re still feeling your way around, but you\u2019re the boss now. If someone wants your throat, Dad can\u2019t stop it. In fact, if someone wants your throat, and tears it out, Dad not only can\u2019t stop it, he\u2019s gotta pay fealty to the new Pack leader. Instead of leaving grotesque hope-you-fuck-up-the-new-job-bitch! gifts on the back steps, they should be kicking the door down and wanting to make with the rumble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRumble?\u201d She almost laughed.</p><p>\u201cWatch an old movie. Just once. That\u2019s all I ask. Once. And you know I\u2019m right; you know a Challenge works way better than a gut-laden welcome mat. You\u2019re still thought of as an annoying little kid even though you\u2019re an annoying adult. So what\u2019s with the dead pets? It\u2019s so dumb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot pets. A bat and a fish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Lara. A pet fish and a pet bat.\u201d</p><p>Shit. \u201cI didn\u2019t think of it like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay.\u201d He yawned, grabbing a double handful of bacon from the sideboard. The breakfast room was splashed with so much sunshine Sean\u2019s eyes were almost closed in a squint. He\u2019d worn sunglasses every day for a month until their father had had enough and banned them. \u201cYou know we don\u2019t keep you around for your great big brain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo . . .\u201d She pushed her mug over to her brother, staring at her iPad while he gulped the last three scalding mouthfuls. \u201cDo I call Dad first, or them?\u201d</p><p>Sean didn\u2019t say anything, which she should have guessed. He\u2019d tease, they\u2019d banter, he\u2019d make pointed remarks about her dreadful clothes or morning breath or lack of boyfriends, but for a real question? He knew it was her call. Literally her call.</p><p>She opened her mouth to make it, but cut herself off.</p><p>He\u2019s here!</p><p>\u201cLara?\u201d Debbie, one of the kitchen staff, poked her head around the corner. \u201cWe got that mess on the step cleaned up\u2014sorry we didn\u2019t catch it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever apologize!\u201d Sean\u2019s voice was muffled with bacon. \u201cYou had two hundred bacon strips to fry. That comes before everything.\u201d</p><p>Debbie laughed at him; she\u2019d been working in the Wyndham kitchens since their father was Sean\u2019s age, and feared none of them. \u201cListen to you, boy. Slow down! Lara, hon, Jack Gardner\u2019s here to see you. And, Sean? We can put on a new pot of cocoa if you like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, my sister\u2019s backwash dregs are all I\u2019m gonna need. So it goes for Pack peons. Hmm, I might have to start a club. The PPs. We\u2019ll need a kicky slogan, though. Wait, what? Jack\u2019s here, finally? Lara, that\u2019ll put a smile on your hideous ugly face! I know you were wondering why they didn\u2019t stop by yesterday.\u201d</p><p>He was coming. She couldn\u2019t hear him, but she could feel him.</p><p>\u201cLara?\u201d</p><p>She hoped dead pets and Gardner\u2019s arrival were only coincidences. She had no taste for what she\u2019d have to do if they weren\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cHellooooo?\u201d</p><p>Almost there. Almost there. Almost there. She was on her feet and had no memory of moving. When had she stood? Had she always been standing?</p><p>A polite rap on the doorway (there was no actual door, just an open space that led from the kitchen hallway) and he was there. He was right there, filling her senses, her world. She could hear him filling her\u2014or was that just the thrum of blood in her ears, the call of hers to his?</p><p>Someone was speaking to her, but their voice was tinny and fading. A tall, broad-shouldered shape and fog-colored eyes and her-his-their instant desperate need, that\u2019s what she saw and felt.</p><p>\u201cHi, Jack! Great to see you! I know it\u2019s been a couple of years\u2014are your folks here?\u201d</p><p>Had she always been waiting for him to return to her life?</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>Yes. She had. When had the world gotten so small? It was her. And it was him.</p><p>\u201cJack?\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s all. That\u2019s all the world was, now.</p><p>\u201cOh my God.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t be feeling like this unless he is, too. Impossible. Impossible. Oh, I\u2019m not lonely anymore . . . and now I know why Dad isn\u2019t, even if I never noticed, or thought to ask.</p><p>\u201cOh my God! Don\u2019t! Don\u2019t do anything yet!\u201d She could almost hear the sound of furniture being knocked over in Sean\u2019s haste to leave. \u201cLook, I\u2019m going, I\u2019m going! Jack, move out of the doorway and I will leave, I promise. Jack! Move so I can flee! Jaaaaaaack!\u201d</p><p>At last, at last, at last, Jack was moving, and he took the quickest path to her, he took two steps and then stepped on the chair and then used the chair as a stepladder to the table and plates crashed and broke and glasses shattered as he walked through bacon and broken crockery and a plate of scrambled eggs and stepped in the butter and knocked over the vase of sunflowers and plodded through the plate of sliced tomatoes to get to her and it was all taking so long.</p><p>Why, he\u2019s been walking through breakfast looking at me for days and days! And who is screaming?</p><p>\u201cPlease wait until I get clear of the building, for the love of God! Yuck! Yuck! No, Deb, do not go in there, for your life. Or at least your eyes. No one go near this room for the rest of the day! Do we have any crime scene tape?\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER NINE</p><p>By the time Jack reached her, he was pulling at his shirt and she had torn hers off (though it was so ancient it hadn\u2019t needed much force). She tried to step toward him and tripped; he caught her before she went sprawling.</p><p>Then he was kicking out of his dark brown boat shoes, their bottoms caked with bacon and butter and glass shards\u2014</p><p>(maybe he should leave them on) </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2014and she was trying to help him with his jeans, and her hands felt like they\u2019d grown extra fingers, and none of the fingers could hear her brain\u2019s commands; she was clumsy at the best of times, and now she was almost paralyzed.</p><p>While she was puzzling the intricacies of his belt\u2014</p><p>(shiny thing equals buckle, buckle must be pulled on until prong is released equals jeans down equals jeans off equals sex)</p> <p>\u2014his mouth came down on hers in a kiss so scorching, she felt the jolt to her toes.</p><p>(Buckle must be destroyed equals jeans off equals sex.)</p><p>She could feel his hands on her waist, her thighs, pulling, and then her (beltless!) sweat pants were reduced to a few sad tufts of faded cotton and she finally defeated her ancient (or so it seemed; how long had she been battling the fucking thing?) nemesis, the belt buckle, and yanked at his zipper and jeans hard enough to jerk him forward. Then he was laughing into her mouth and she could see the funny side to their insane urgency. Not so funny they\u2019d be willing to stop and discuss how amusing it all was, but, yeah, still funny.</p><p>\u201cHate your\u2014nnf!\u2014jeans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me\u2014agh!\u201d He slipped in butter or bacon grease and winced; she smelled blood and realized he\u2019d cut his foot on broken glass.</p> <p>\u201cDammit . . . dammit! Come here.\u201d She grabbed his forearms and pulled; he skidded with her. She glanced down at the sideboard to take inventory\u2014</p><p>(candlesticks, bread basket, biscuits, more butter, pitcher of orange juice, three juice glasses, pile of napkins, several clean forks, I hate orange juice!)</p><p>\u2014and then swept it all off\u2014</p><p>(Kara\u2019s gonna kill me)</p><p>\u2014and hopped up. She realized she still had her panties on and hopped down and yanked and then hopped back up. A clever man, Jack had caught on and put his\u2014</p><p>(warm, strong, ummmmmmm)</p> <p>\u2014hands on her knees and spread them, dropped his pants\u2014</p><p>(screw you, belt buckle! You have no power now!)</p><p>\u2014and surged forward and put his arms around her lower back and yanked her to him, and he slid into her warm wetness like a knife through butter (like the kind he was standing in and she was sitting in). He\u2019d barely seated himself inside her when he pulled back, and she opened her mouth to groan in protest. (Was the belt buckle having the last laugh after all?)</p><p>His next stroke forced the air from her lungs in a gasp, something that, if she\u2019d read it in a book, she would assume had hurt.</p><p>It didn\u2019t. She hooked her ankles just above his ass and held on tight, clutched his shoulders, and bit his ear so hard blood squirted in her mouth and he shuddered. \u201cNever stop,\u201d she hissed, her words slurred with so much desire she thought she might die of it, and his blood was in her and his cock was in her and this was the secret, this was how it was supposed to be. \u201cNever stop, Jack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever,\u201d he said, and bit her back, and her orgasm was on her like a breaker.</p><p>CHAPTER TEN</p><p>\u201cOkay. That was . . . buttery.\u201d</p> <p>Jack, who\u2019d sort of slumped to the floor after his explosive orgasm, had just enough strength to laugh. \u201cExactly what I was going for.\u201d</p><p>Lara, still sitting on the sideboard, studied him, this man she\u2019d dreamed of for years, had feared for years without knowing why. Now she knew. It made her no less afraid, but the fear changed nothing. They were supposed to be together. They were mated long before they had fucked. Her other self, the self with four legs and fur, the part many Pack members thought of as their true self, had known.</p><p>\u201cYou know, when we were younger and you\u2019d come to visit, I\u2019d have to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave the room so you wouldn\u2019t pick up on how badly I wanted you.\u201d He\u2019d staggered to his feet and was gingerly picking the remains of his clothes from the mess of butter/sugar/broken glass covering at least a third of the floor. \u201cYou were always beautiful. You always seemed so far above me. I didn\u2019t have the courage to let you see how badly I needed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d she cheerfully confessed, \u201cI was a big chicken about my desire, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelief! Ouch.\u201d He made a futile attempt to wipe the bottom of his foot clean. \u201cI wonder that our fathers never picked up\u2014ouch\u2014on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe should just stop moving except to find the door.\u201d Lara pushed some broken glass out of their path with her big toe. \u201cAnd maybe they did but never discussed it. Or maybe they didn\u2019t, because they\u2019re our fathers and will always see us as children to be protected. Not adults who\u2014\u201d She cut herself off. Who should be doing the protecting. The bat. The fish. And what next? And why?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s ours to protect,\u201d Jack told her. His arms were scraped and scratched, like her back, like the bottoms of their feet. Every step was a crunch and a wince.</p><p>\u201cStop that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReading my mind.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t smile; he was studying her. The color of his eyes was somehow sharper as he took her in, all of her. She let him look; it was the first time someone had stared at her that she hadn\u2019t taken as a challenge. After a long while\u2014or so it seemed to her, but it may have been only seconds\u2014he said, \u201cI dreamed about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d she said, and went to him, and stood in his warm embrace while butter oozed between her toes. \u201cWe have to get the hell out of this room.\u201d</p><p>He laughed again, and she realized, in all the visits when they were children and teens and young adults, she\u2019d never seen him laugh.</p><p>He\u2019s complete now, too.</p><p>Why had no one told her what it was like?</p><p>Likely most people don\u2019t know.</p><p>That was a worse thought than the bat and fish \u201cgifts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, then, Lara.\u201d He scooped her up in his arms and tossed her over his shoulder in a fireman\u2019s carry. She clutched his waist, then his ass. \u201cNo need for you to cut your feet more than you have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can . . . heal like Pack, right?\u201d She\u2019d never had to ask. She\u2019d never thought to ask. Not that it mattered. It wasn\u2019t about what Jack could do; it was about what he was. She closed her eyes; staring at his ass was making her forget about glass, cleaning up the mess they\u2019d left in their lust, and dead fish. And breathing regularly.</p><p>\u201cYes. I can heal like your father, like my father.\u201d There was a pause as he picked his way across the room. \u201cEverything but run around on four legs. You\u2019ve never asked me that before.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged as best she could, upside down. \u201cI\u2019m probably going to be asking you lots of things I haven\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease let that be some odd Wyndham euphemism for have more sex until you can\u2019t feel your legs,\u201d he muttered, and she laughed so hard he had to tighten his grip so as not to drop her.</p><p>CHAPTER ELEVEN</p><p>After threatening the kitchen staff with death and mutilation if they went in the breakfast room with so much as a paper towel to start cleaning, she and Jack went to her suite and cleaned up. This led to more delights in the shower, and then on her bathroom floor, and then in her bed. By the time they were clean and dressed, they were also exhausted and it was long past lunchtime.</p><p>\u201cToo bad,\u201d she said, elbowing Jack so he\u2019d move over on the bed. He groaned and halfheartedly rolled a few inches. She flopped down beside him. \u201cWe\u2019ve gotta get the breakfast room cleaned up, and I\u2019ve got to make a phone call. Two calls, actually. And we should eat more. I don\u2019t think you ate at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot eggs or bacon, certainly.\u201d He gently touched her bitten ear. \u201cIs this about what you\u2019ve been worrying all morning?\u201d</p><p>Lara had to smile at been worrying as opposed to been worrying about. Jack used it the way dogs would worry at a sore place on their paw.</p><p>\u201cYeah, which reminds me, you haven\u2019t left dead bats or fish on my kitchen stairs, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh . . . no. I thought I\u2019d try flowers.\u201d</p><p>She snorted. \u201cSure you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might have eventually tried flowers.\u201d He caught her hand and pressed a kiss to her palm. \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting to return to you for a long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReturn to implies we were together and you left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly in dreams,\u201d he said, his eyes far away. \u201cI dream about you all the time.\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll mate and have cubs, then.\u201d</p><p>She nodded again.</p><p>\u201cAnd should probably mention this to both our parents.\u201d</p><p>Hmm. That could be interesting.</p><p>\u201cYour brother, I suspect, is aware.\u201d</p><p>She slapped her forehead. \u201cSean! Ah, God. He might be traumatized.\u201d Pack members weren\u2019t as hung up on sex as Western humans\u2014who was?\u2014but still. When your sister and someone you barely knew started boning away in the breakfast room where you were happily eating bacon mere moments before . . . \u201cAh, God,\u201d she said again, because it was all she could think of.</p><p>Jack gave up trying to keep a straight face and burst out laughing, actually clutching his stomach and rolling back and forth on her bed. \u201cHe was trying to leave the room and screaming like a witch, and my only focus was\u2014well, it wasn\u2019t on him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. Dress first. Clean breakfast room. Apologize to traumatized brother. Make phone calls. You promise you didn\u2019t bring me a dead fish before you came over?\u201d</p><p>Jack sobered and sat up. \u201cNo. And I can tell it\u2019s bothering you more than you\u2019re letting show. Let me help you.\u201d</p><p>Lara studied him, this man she barely knew who would be in her life through death and further. She still couldn\u2019t grasp how he had become so vital so soon; she had no idea how she would explain this to her mother. (Her father would bluster but, she suspected, would also know what she was talking about. He just wouldn\u2019t want to apply that knowledge to anything having to do with his daughter\u2019s sex life. Especially since pre-Jack, the answer to that would have been, \u201cWhat sex life?\u201d)</p><p>\u201cA few years ago my dad had the idea of retiring, not dying.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cExcellent plan.\u201d</p><p>She slapped his leg. \u201cYou know what I mean\u2014so I could learn from him while leading. There\u2019d be a young Pack leader and the old one would still be alive for advice and such. And after he talked about it with my mom, he talked to your dad.\u201d</p><p>Jack nodded. \u201cI remember. Everything changed after that visit.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRight. Well, we talked about it for years, and finally agreed. And yesterday was the big day, and first thing in the morning, before my folks left for Boston, my dad went out and found . . .\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWELVE</p><p>Kara and Deb asked and asked, and the third time Lara refused their help in the breakfast room, she couldn\u2019t take Jack\u2019s pleading looks any longer. \u201cIt\u2019s our mess,\u201d she said again.</p><p>\u201cOf course it is.\u201d He\u2019d gotten dressed in the jeans and the hated belt, but had to borrow one of her dad\u2019s old T-shirts, since his had been ruined. They\u2019d gotten all the gunk off his shoes. \u201cBut they keep coming in wanting to help, and we keep sucking at cleaning up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d Kara called from the kitchen.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re not helping,\u201d Lara called back.</p><p>\u201cAnd they said they have extra help this week, a new kitchen guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true!\u201d Kara called.</p><p>\u201cEnough! Both of you. Let me think.\u201d Lara puffed a lock of dark hair out of her eye. They\u2019d wiped and swept and mopped and hauled out bags of garbage and broken glass, and it still look like they\u2019d barely started. \u201cI guess . . . if you guys insist . . . really insist . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God,\u201d she heard Deb mutter. Kara, Deb, and at least four other cleaners descended on them so quickly Lara realized they\u2019d been waiting patiently in the kitchen for their turn. \u201cThank you,\u201d Deb said as the others scattered around the room and got to work. \u201cAppreciate you wanting to take responsibility. Your folks\u2014your mama especially\u2014she didn\u2019t want a couple of entitled jerks for kids.\u201d Lara nodded; when they were cubs, the quickest way to get in trouble with their folks was to make a mess and then put on let-the-servants-handle-it attitude. \u201cBut you\u2019re not cubs. And you\u2019re in our way. And you\u2019re terrible at this. And don\u2019t you have more important things to be doing, Pack leader?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, all right.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBesides, these things happen.\u201d Deb was giving Jack a long look and Lara caught the sharp scent of her interest. \u201cAnd probably will again, I\u2019m betting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlso, when you tell your folks what happened, can you do it when we\u2019re all around and can hear the whole thing? What?\u201d Kara asked when Deb rolled her eyes. \u201cMy Cloud cable\u2019s out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and you!\u201d</p><p>Lara had been so consumed with the work\u2014and the odors\u2014she hadn\u2019t heard or scented Sean\u2019s return. He was standing, arms akimbo, in the doorway, giving her a Level Four Death Glare\u2014until then, only her mother had been capable of generating that level of wrath from eyes alone.</p><p>\u201cHi, Sean,\u201d Lara said, so meekly everyone else stared.</p><p>\u201cAh, Sean, we just\u2014\u201d Jack began.</p><p>\u201cShut your cake hole, fornicator! You and you . . . let\u2019s go upstairs and talk.\u201d</p><p>Fornicator? Jack mouthed at her as they followed Sean up the stairs. She shrugged, pointed at Sean\u2019s back, and mimed a look of utter contrition.</p> <p>\u201cI can hear you, you know,\u201d Sean said, which made no sense, but they dropped their hands and followed like a couple bound for the gallows.</p><p>\u201cOkay, first? Gross, and gross. And walking through bacon? I don\u2019t know what kind of degenerate jungle you grew up in, Jack \u2018I Think I\u2019ll Bang Your Sister Right This Second\u2019 Gardner, but if you\u2019re gonna be living here, which I assume because of the banging you are, you\u2019re gonna have to treat bacon with a whole other level of respect, all the time. Oh, and be a good mate to my sister and a good dad to your cubs and stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRespect bacon.\u201d Jack nodded. \u201cGood mate, good dad. Yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you!\u201d Sean jabbed a forefinger at Lara, who watched it warily. Rarely had her brother gotten so frothy. Of course, he had cause. But it was still odd to see him genuinely irked. \u201cI get how alpha-ness is a curse of loneliness and no one can understand the depth of your sad pathetic forlorn-ness, blah-blah-blah, but take ninety damned seconds and get a room. There are twenty bedrooms in this house! There is no need to harm the bacon, ever!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Sean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean, I understand why you couldn\u2019t resist. You\u2019ve gotten nailed\u2014what? Five times in the last five years?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Jack asked, unable to conceal his delight and surprise. \u201cBut you\u2019re so beautiful, and you could have any\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one\u2019s talking to you, Jack-in-the-penis!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Sean.\u201d What sort of toys did this boy play with as a child? \u201cSorry, Sean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyway, I get why you were slaves to your grotesque animal urges, I\u2019m just saying leave the bacon out of it. Okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, Sean.\u201d</p><p>Jack was still nodding. \u201cWe\u2019re very sorry, Sean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you aren\u2019t, Jack, but when my dad decides to beat you to death, you\u2019ll both need an ally, so I\u2019m officially forgiving you gross weird fornicators.\u201d</p><p>He hangs around waaaaay too many humans. Fornicators?</p><p>\u201cYou leave humans out of this,\u201d Sean retorted, still pointing. He collapsed into the nearest chair; they were in one of the game rooms, so there were plenty. \u201cNow. The fish? The bat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack says no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich means no. And speaking of humans and hanging out with them too much\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf a Packer was doing those things, we\u2019d smell it on them.\u201d Not so much the bat and the fish, but the deceit. The guilt. Packers couldn\u2019t lie to each other, not about real things.</p><p>\u201cWell, yeah. I was thinking about that while you two were\u2014while I was trying really, really hard to think of something else. So who\u2019s the human leaving you grisly love notes, and why? What does any human care about Pack stuff?\u201d</p><p>It reminded her of the old childhood joke: Q) Why did the human cross the road? A) Why do humans do anything they do?</p><p>There were humans on the Cape\u2014all over the world\u2014who knew about the Pack. Sure there were. There were inter-Pack/human matings and friendships, of course, starting at the top with the then-alpha and his mate. When Jeannie moved to the mansion, she hadn\u2019t given up her human ties, her human friends. And in the near-mid-twenty-first century when the world was aware there were mermaids and vampires, the need to keep all things Pack a deep dark secret had never been less vital.</p><p>\u201cSo any number of humans could have left the bat and the fish,\u201d Lara summed up. \u201cWho\u2019d want to, though? And that\u2019s a queer kind of courage, walking into the wolves\u2019 den to leave that stuff. In front of everybody\u2014in broad daylight, even.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you knew who, you\u2019d know why,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cAnd speaking of why, I\u2019d better call now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll done having sex for a while?\u201d Sean asked snidely. \u201cReady to get back to the boring business of Pack leadership? Swelleriffic.\u201d She ignored his jibes, but wouldn\u2019t much longer. Sean must have sensed her tolerance was coming to an end, because he moved from scolding to brisk. \u201cWho first?\u201d</p><p>Lara sighed. \u201cYou know who.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDouble swelleriffic!\u201d</p><p>Jack was looking from brother to sister and back again. \u201cThis is why I\u2019m glad I was an only child . . . You two practically have your own language.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt compensates for bacon brutalization. When I close my eyes I can still see it . . . It was like you raped my bacon . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cLittle brother, please shut the hell up. This is hard enough. I almost hate to do it. But it\u2019s irresponsible if I don\u2019t.\u201d She shrugged, then raised her voice and said to the air, \u201cCall: Betsy Taylor.\u201d</p><p>As they waited for the call to go through, Jack said, \u201cThe vampire queen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFriend of the family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know\u2014the whole Pack knows\u2014but I thought her name was Elizabeth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is, only there was some famous old-timey movie star who had the same name, so she went by Betsy to avoid confusion, and it stuck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little respect, please!\u201d Sean yelped. \u201cOld timey? Elizabeth Taylor, circa 1932 to 2011. Jeez. You guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s of course her prerogative,\u201d Jack said, puzzled, \u201cbut it\u2019s a kid\u2019s name.\u201d</p><p>Lara shrugged. \u201cShe\u2019s gotta be . . . let me think . . . fifty? No. Almost sixty.\u201d It was hard to tell, because Betsy always looked the same. \u201cCould she be almost seventy? My dad would know . . . maybe . . .\u201d</p><p>He raised a dark brow. \u201cSo you\u2019re calling an old woman who isn\u2019t Pack for advice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRespect!\u201d Sean yelped again, picking up a cork coaster and lobbing it at Jack. He ducked and it sailed harmlessly over his head. \u201cPlease!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not calling for advice. And you\u2019ll like her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Jack smiled. \u201cYou like her. So you assume everyone else will.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014for one second, Sink Lair! You know the rules: if you use up the last of the strawberries, you have to buy more yourself. No fair leaving the empty\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetsy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? What did you\u2014No, that\u2019s not Tina\u2019s job, and you\u2019re not delegating, you\u2019re just being more of an asshat than usual.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetsy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? What? Sinclair, can you hear\u2014Oh, shit . . . Am I on the phone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, this is Lara Wyndham. Calling from the Cape.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate\u2014wait. I\u2019ve gotta start talking slower; the tech has trouble understanding if I talk fast\u2014Okay, just\u2014it\u2019s nice to hear from you and all\u2014Am I still on the phone?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can hear me?\u201d</p><p>Um, obviously. \u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh. Okay.\u201d A gusty sigh, which made Lara roll her eyes. Betsy didn\u2019t have to breathe, so the sighs were solely for drama. \u201cI miss my iPhone. So much!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s an iPhone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d</p><p>Sean clapped both hands over his mouth to squash the giggles. Where once there were Clouds for online storage, to keep data and e-books and files of enormous size, phones had gone the same way. From wire to wireless to Cloud, once the area in question was tech-prepped, people just had to raise their voices and say the right thing and/or the right numbers, and the Cloud would connect the call. No big clunky fifty-millimeter-by-one-hundred-millimeter phones; their voices were all the hardware they needed.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? I haven\u2019t seen your folks in forever.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, they\u2019re fine . . . Betsy, there might be trouble headed your way. Something\u2019s happened here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, what? Jeez, you\u2019ve been the PIC for, what, thirty hours?\u201d</p><p>Sean leaned forward. \u201cPIC?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, sweetie! Packer in Charge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you even know\u2014\u201d Lara slapped her forehead. She\u2019d likely bruise soon, if she didn\u2019t get smarter. \u201cMy dad told you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe gave us a heads up, yeah,\u201d Betsy admitted. \u201cHe didn\u2019t anticipate any problems, it was just an FYI.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA what?\u201d Sean was always interested in old acronyms.</p><p>\u201cThe worst thing about how there aren\u2019t phones anymore is that you\u2019re always, fucking always, on speaker phone,\u201d the vampire fumed from fifteen hundred miles away.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s a speaker ph\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d</p><p>Sean stuck his tongue out at the air, and nearly bit it when Betsy shrilled, \u201cI heard that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpooky,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cListen, it\u2019s not that I don\u2019t find it flattering that a gorgeous young werewolf with her own Pack to run amok with is taking time out to chat with an old lady, but why are you calling really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s not a whole lot to tell,\u201d Lara began, \u201csince we\u2019re not really sure ourselves what\u2019s going on. And my parents aren\u2019t here, so\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you in danger?\u201d Betsy asked sharply, all playfulness gone from her tone. \u201cLara, it is not weakness to ask an old friend for help, okay? There are ways to get me to visit that don\u2019t involve letting your mom know you\u2019re worried you\u2019re in over your head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2014\u201d She looked at her brother and Jack, both sitting calmly, two of the six people out of billions she\u2019d show uncertainty to. \u201cWhat makes you think I think I might be in over my head even though nothing too terrible has happened yet?\u201d</p><p>Betsy made an impatient noise and followed it with, \u201cBecause you\u2019re not a raging sociopath. Anybody would be in over their head. You\u2019re barely cloning age and you\u2019re responsible for thousands. Or millions. However many Pack members are running around peeing on fire hydrants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Betsy,\u201d she groaned. \u201cThat\u2019s awful. You\u2019re awful.\u201d</p><p>The vampire laughed and laughed. \u201cGotcha. Totally worth it; I bet that\u2019s the first time you\u2019ve smiled in days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe third or fourth, actually,\u201d she said, looking at Jack and ignoring Sean\u2019s feigned vomiting. She explained what happened, and was a bit piqued to hear Betsy\u2019s (overly dramatic) sigh of relief. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA dead bat? That\u2019s it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was concerned it was a symbol you or yours may be in trouble,\u201d Lara said coldly, \u201cand wished to take the time to inform you of same. So sorry to have bothered you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLara, wait.\u201d A short silence, mercifully sigh-free; they could hear her murmuring to someone, probably the dead-sexy vampire king. \u201cI did that badly. I\u2019m sorry I said it the way I did, and I don\u2019t mean to make light of your problems. I\u2019m glad you called and I\u2019m truly sorry you\u2019re in difficulty. It\u2019s just\u2014trust me, I was afraid it was something else, something I thought I fixed. Something I\u2019m pretty sure I did fix, so don\u2019t worry. About that, I mean. Believe me, the world could be in much, much, much, much, much, much, much, much, much, much, much, much, much worse shape than it is now, even after the Kardashian Massacre. Those idiots\u2014taking over every television network with their insipid \u2018reality\u2019 shows wasn\u2019t enough? They had to try for the entire Eastern Seaboard? All because Kim lost the election to Tina Fey?\u201d</p><p>This is the problem with the elderly; they love their tangents. Lara rubbed her eyes; low on sleep rations, exhausted from hours of astonishing sex. All right, there are worse problems.</p><p>Betsy\u2019s ramble was coming to an end. \u201c. . . anyway, take my word for it: worse things might have happened, and now won\u2019t, and so as terrible as things are right now, it\u2019s not a tenth as bad as they might have been, so chin up, l\u2019il werewolf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is one of those mysterious vampire things, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, hon, it is.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed a yawn. \u201cI hate when you call me l\u2019il werewolf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Lara wasn\u2019t sure whether to be relieved or irritated. She opted for the former. \u201cYou\u2019ll tell me the whole story some day? Assuming I live through this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell . . . all right, but in one version I come off really evil and ancient and dress in truly ugly gear, the version that will never come to pass.\u201d\u2021\u2021</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try to be brave throughout your torrid tale of ugly gear,\u201d Lara promised. \u201cYou\u2019re sure everything else is all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything else is hunky-dory. You have no idea what that means, do you? Sean will tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I won\u2019t,\u201d he called.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make me come out there,\u201d the vampire threatened.</p><p>\u201cI would love it if you came out here.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cPerv! I\u2019m old enough to be your . . . um . . . big sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat bullshit,\u201d Lara said.</p><p>\u201cCome on, you haven\u2019t visited in forever,\u201d Sean whined. \u201cIt\u2019s only twenty-four hundred kilometers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it! Stop using the metric system.\u201d</p><p>Lara winced. Another pet peeve of the elderly. \u201cBetsy\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate the goddamned thing! We shouldn\u2019t have agreed to the switch and we shouldn\u2019t be teaching it to our kids!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, hey,\u201d Lara soothed. \u201cCome on. Canada really helped us out during the Kardashian riots. The least we could do was adopt the metric system and help Quebec gain independence and be its own country. In lives saved alone, it was worth it\u2014you\u2019ve got to admit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have to do anything except stay hot and not turn evil,\u201d she snapped.</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019ve done at least one of those things,\u201d Lara said with evil intent, knowing the vain vampire would spend the rest of the night wondering which one she meant. \u201cEnd.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, now that\u2019s just ru\u2014\u201d</p><p>Heh. Got the last word in, anyway. Betsy hated the new phone tech, and half the time chattered five minutes after the call ended. It was comforting: it was one of the few ways the vampire queen acted her age. It could be jarring to be with someone who looked thirty but was close to a century old.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to meet her,\u201d Jack admitted. \u201cI think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you would\u2014I told you, you\u2019d like her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she loves my sister,\u201d Sean said. \u201cIt\u2019s so annoying. I should be the one the dead queen loves! Why do dead queens only love stupid Lara?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d she replied, embarrassed. \u201cYou know she likes all of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe likes me. She likes Mom and Dad. She likes Jack\u2019s folks\u2014so, yeah, Jack, you should definitely meet her. But she loves Lara.\u201d</p><p>Jack smiled. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have several weeks? My list is lengthy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe likes me because she\u2019s a vampire queen who\u2019s not afraid to get her hands bloody or shitty. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, well,\u201d Jack teased. \u201cIf that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe first time she came out here, she took me to the playground and I got into a fight with a local kid.\u201d Lara shrugged; it was a story she remembered only because other people liked to tell it. She herself had no real memory of the incident; she\u2019d still been a cub, and such power tussles were far more frequent for cubs than human children. \u201cApparently I made the turd my beta bitch and Betsy saw the whole thing and loved it. We were pals after that. And my folks liked her, once they got to know her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, mine, too.\u201d Jack smiled, remembering. \u201cMy mom liked how Betsy never held your mom shooting her against her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom put three in her chest.\u201d That she did remember, though she\u2019d been even younger than at the time of the playground incident. \u201cIt just made Betsy mad. It . . . made an impression.\u201d One way to put it. \u201cBut I\u2019m just talking because I\u2019m putting off what I don\u2019t want to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s not starting to have sex while a your brother\u2019s in the room . . . You sure didn\u2019t put that off . . .\u201d</p><p>Lara didn\u2019t smile. \u201cYou know. The easy one\u2019s done.\u201d She raised her voice. \u201cCall . . . Fredrika . . . Bimm.\u201d</p><p>Jack\u2019s eyebrows\u2014the most eloquent brows she\u2019d ever seen, frankly\u2014arched again.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah,\u201d Sean said, noticing. \u201cIt\u2019s a party around here allll the time. After we call the mermaid, let\u2019s call a fairy or a banshee or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, that\u2014\u201d Jack began, but just then the mermaid answered, and whatever he said was cut off.</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTEEN </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes, hello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDr. Bimm. It\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLara and Sean.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd the fornicator to be named later,\u201d Sean began, but Lara whipped a soft pillow at him, which hit right between the eyes, and the resulting dust cloud incapacitated him for several seconds.</p><p>Lara raised her voice to be heard over his wheezing. \u201cDr. Bimm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, Lara?\u201d Dr. Fredrika Bimm, her generation\u2019s Cousteau, had a phone manner identical to her manner in person: brisk and borderline unfriendly. \u201cSomeone giving you trouble already? What\u2019s it been, thirty hours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnbelievable,\u201d she muttered. She described the bat and the fish and the condition both had been left in. \u201cSo my questions are\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre the Undersea Folk, aka Mermaids on Parade, sending the Wyndham Pack a message in a deliberately vague, careless, and sloppy way?\u201d</p> <p>Somewhat taken aback, it took Lara a few seconds to respond. Funny how hearing my dad deal with Dr. Fred was funny as hell. Actually having to deal with her, less so. \u201cNo, I was concerned you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause we\u2019re not. The Undersea Folk have nothing\u2014not one single thing\u2014to fear from your Pack. And if we did, we\u2019d send a message you would find unmistakable in its threat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s good.\u201d I guess. She thought about it, then mentally shrugged and asked, \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst, our territory is about fifty thousand times the size of yours. Second, we\u2019ve got corresponding population to match. Third, the Folk have two-thirds of the ocean to wander in; the Pack has . . . Cape Cod. Which is sinking. Into the ocean.\u201d</p><p>Silence. Even Sean had lost his smile.</p><p>\u201cFourth, even if Orleans and Barnstable and Yarmouth don\u2019t become Atlantis II, III, and IV, you\u2019re losing more territory each year and will eventually have to make nicey-nice\u2014more so than your father already has\u2014with the Folk. Or declare war, which you\u2019ll lose, so you\u2019ll have to play nice. I\u2019m not sure about the vampires, but you can be sure they\u2019re wondering about it, even if Betsy thinks you\u2019re just too, too adorable to take seriously yet.</p> <p>\u201cFifth, if I had a problem with you, Lara, you\u2019d know it. Your family would know it. My family would know it. There would be no puzzled ruminations followed by vague phone calls to fish, no pun intended. You would know, and you and I would work out our problem, or we wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome to my home anytime to work out anything you like,\u201d Lara said pleasantly, ears pricked forward. Thinking: Come on, come on, come on. Thinking, An actual fight would be terrific as opposed to ruminating followed by phone calls. She\u2019d come and we\u2019d go; she\u2019d likely get a few licks in and then I\u2019d eat her cold, cold heart, problem solved. \u201cReally, Dr. Bimm. Anytime.\u201d</p><p>Fred chuckled, a short sound full of warm humor\u2014the only warmth she\u2019d shown during the conversation so far. \u201cNo chance, Lara. You like to fight. I think you need to; I think you\u2019re almost as bad as the humans that way. You\u2019ll always be better at it than me because you like it, and I don\u2019t. You might actually get the upper hand, and that would be inconvenient for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe sure don\u2019t want to inconvenience you, Dr. Bimm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFred, for God\u2019s sake, I\u2019ve been telling you to call me Fred for over a decade. Lara, it\u2019s not us\u2014I think I\u2019ve made that clear\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs clear as the clearest piece of glass in the clearest window in the world,\u201d Sean added.</p><p>\u201cShush, boy. As I said, it\u2019s not us\u2014but if you\u2019re in trouble, if people are moving against the power shift already, the kids and I can be there in six hours.\u201d</p><p>A good trick, from the bottom of the Caspian Sea. But Lara knew she meant it. Dr. Bimm got off on pretending she didn\u2019t give a shit, while secretly giving a shit. Not one of my parents\u2019 friends are normal. This is significant, probably.</p> <p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t care what you guys are doing on your puny little sand bars, but I do. It\u2019s one of my many flaws,\u201d Dr. Bimm admitted. \u201cDo you need help holding one of your puny little sand bars?\u201d</p><p>Aww. I may cry with gratitude. \u201cWe can handle it,\u201d she replied, looking at Jack, who\u2019d been listening to the entire thing with an expression made up of astonishment, irritation, and admiration. \u201cBut if not, you\u2019ll be the . . . thirtieth or fortieth person I\u2019ll call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOuch,\u201d the mermaid said with mild reproach. \u201cEnd.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDammit,\u201d Lara muttered, slumping back in her seat.</p><p>\u201cNow you know how poor Queen Betsy feels when you hang up on her.\u201d Funny how, though there were no phones anymore, the phone slang persisted. Nobody really dialed anyone, either, but they sure said they did.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not all I know. It\u2019s good they\u2019re not having any trouble on their end. But it doesn\u2019t help us figure out what\u2019s going on here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBat, fish. I suppose you\u2019ve already thought of this,\u201d Jack said, standing, walking around Lara\u2019s chair, and leaning down to rub the tension out of her shoulders. \u201cBut perhaps a guard for the kitchen steps. All the steps?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019ve thought of that,\u201d she lied, and his shoulder rub turned into a pinch. She yelped and slapped his hand. \u201cAll right, busted, I haven\u2019t. But, yes, absolutely. I\u2019ll watch the damned kitchen steps myself as many nights as I\u2014\u201d</p><p>Her brother cut her off. \u201cYou\u2019re not thinking like a boss, Lara. You\u2019ve got people to do that stuff. Dad wouldn\u2019t stand guard. But he\u2019d make sure it got done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue enough.\u201d She thought another few seconds. \u201cIf the theory is our \u2018pets\u2019 are in danger, what\u2019s after the bat and the fish? Would humans count?\u201d</p><p>The three young people all looked at each other, and Lara knew in that moment they were afraid, too. \u201cLook, Mom is with Dad.\u201d Sean\u2019s voice cracked in his anxiety, and he cleared his throat and continued, stronger: \u201cShe\u2019s safe. Even if she was alone, nobody could roll up on her. But, yeah, maybe that\u2019s where these cowardly fucks are going. So we definitely need to post watches tonight. Nobody needs to trip over a dead body in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, that\u2019s good. The folks are due back by sundown anyway, so I\u2019ll brief them about what\u2019s been going on, and Sean\u2019s theories.\u201d She shot her brother a look of pure gratitude. \u201cHave I mentioned how glad I am you blew off the Boston trip?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how am I repaid? With bacon rape. I think we\u2019d better starting looking around before tonight. I\u2019ll go down and ask the kitchen gang who\u2019s been running around here\u2014any strangers\u2014like that. Oh, and check for a dead body on the steps while I\u2019m at it. After I get a sandwich.\u201d</p><p>He left and Jack bent and dropped a kiss to the top of her head. \u201cInsatiable,\u201d she remarked to no one in particular.</p><p>\u201cWell, I thought it would be in poor taste to seduce you in front of your brother again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got it backward; I was the one who put my gear in Seduce.\u201d She wasn\u2019t in the mood for love-banter\u2014and she was awful at it during the best of times\u2014and got to her feet and began to walk around the game room, circling the pool table and occasionally picking up balls and clicking them together before dropping them back on the felt. Jack sat in her chair, and watched. \u201cY\u2019know, Dad had straightforward challenges to his authority. Fights, people trying to murder him\u2014there\u2019s no gray area there, nothing to ponder. You fight and the winner is the winner. The end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe good old days,\u201d Jack agreed, and she knew he was trying not to laugh.</p><p>\u201cI know how that sounds.\u201d She managed a half smile. \u201cDumb thing to wish for, or envy, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too hard on yourself\u2014and always have been. Even when I only had cameos in your life, that much was obvious. My father says you and yours are the same\u2014you only fear being caught in a mistake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd being caught by Sean during sexual shenanigans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI now fear that, too,\u201d he replied so solemnly she snickered. \u201cI\u2019ll watch the steps, Lara. It wouldn\u2019t be the first time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d She was a little startled at the topic change, then realized it wasn\u2019t a change at all. \u201cWhat are you talking about, the first time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe reason we didn\u2019t pay tribute yesterday, officially meet our new leader. We were here, prowling the property,\u201d he told her. \u201cYour father told mine when he left for Boston. My father and I kept watch all around, all day and all night. Once that first twenty-four hours was up, with no obvious trouble, we let off the watch.\u201d He rubbed his forehead. \u201cThat was our mistake\u2014looking for obvious trouble. A Challenger wanting to eat your heart. A declaration of war. Nothing like what happened yesterday morning and today. So no one saw who left the fish.\u201d</p><p>Lara nearly squirmed with dueling emotions: That\u2019s so sweet, you chauvinist dolts! \u201cWell, thank you. I think. That was very . . .\u201d Condescending? Thoughtful? Annoying? Wonderful?</p><p>Before she could cough up something not completely insulting, he added, \u201cMy mother was also standing by.\u201d</p><p>Lara nearly vomited in terror. Morgan LeFay\u2019s odd sorceries were nightmarish even when she was on your side. Not that Sara Gardner was Morgan LeFay. She was the reincarnation of Morgan LeFay. Instead of magic, she had luck. All the time.</p><p>Low on cash? Sara could buy a lottery ticket and win.</p><p>Bad guy shooting at her? The gun would jam and the bolt would blow back and through the shooter\u2019s brain. Or the floor he\u2019d been standing on would crumble beneath him and he\u2019d fall screaming to his death. Or his left ventricle would blow like a spare tire and he\u2019d drop dead with blood in his mouth.</p><p>Sara couldn\u2019t control it, that was the terrifying thing. Her magic, her luck, was unquantifiable and unpredictable and unconscious. So Sara might take a dislike to you and then . . . oops! Your cat got run over. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat was . . . thoughtful.\u201d She tried to get a grip on her extreme trepidation. The woman was on their side. She was practically family. Hell, as of their morning mating, she was Lara\u2019s mother-in-law.</p><p>She and Derik really were made for each other . . . he can\u2019t stay here without wanting a piece of Dad, and people end up terrified of his wife . . . Humans are so frail, she\u2019s probably killed several without meaning to. She\u2019s never killed Pack. We\u2019re a little better at landing on our feet. Or her power\u2014her sorcery?\u2014understands at all levels that the Pack is no threat to her. The opposite of a threat, in fact. Maybe all this time they\u2019ve been waiting . . . we\u2019ve all been waiting . . .</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m grateful your family was watching our home.\u201d She went to him, took his hands, looked up at him. His ear had healed, as hers had. It made her want to draw blood again, and do other things, too, but she forced herself to focus. \u201cI\u2019m grateful your family will be in our lives now. I want your father here\u2014I\u2019m next-gen alpha, he\u2019ll have no issue with my status. And of course he couldn\u2019t come without his mate. Your mother; our cubs\u2019 grandmother. You\u2019re all welcome here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat almost sounds like a speech,\u201d he said, giving her a soft kiss.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a speech, I think\u2014I didn\u2019t practice. It\u2019s just what I felt. All kinds of things I knew without knowing I knew are coming out. You know, other Pack leaders really should have written a manual or a book on this stuff, would that be too much? Don\u2019t laugh, I\u2019m serious!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not laughing at you,\u201d he lied, and kissed her again. \u201cA how-to, by Lara Wyndham-Gardner, it\u2019ll be just what our cub needs. But not for fifty years at least.\u201d</p><p>She kissed him back and felt his urgency, dropped her fingers to his jeans and traced his thickening length. But quick as thought, she jerked her hands away when she heard her brother\u2019s pounding footsteps.</p><p>\u201cWe weren\u2019t\u2014\u201d she began, but stopped when he darted into the room.</p> <p>\u201cSomebody had the same thought we did. About the next dead pet being human. And that maybe we\u2019d catch on to their timeline and post a watch.\u201d There wasn\u2019t a trace of a smile on her brother\u2019s face, which got Lara\u2019s attention more than anything he could have said. \u201cBetter come see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a dead human on the kitchen stoop.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER FOURTEEN</p><p>\u201cI have had enough!\u201d</p><p>Lara stood over the body, that of a man she guessed was her father\u2019s age, face down on the stoop. It was nearing the dinner hour, so the kitchen was bustling with several people a few feet away with too much to do and too little time to do it. No one had needed to go out on the step (Packers didn\u2019t smoke) so no one knew there was a corpse waiting for\u2014what? The first course?</p> <p>\u201cYuck,\u201d was her brother\u2019s comment. \u201cWhat\u2019s the opposite of an amuse-buche?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious, no more old TV for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack off, skank. You\u2019re not the boss of me. Except I just remembered you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSkank?\u201d Jack, she could see, was having trouble following them. She and Sean did have their own language, the language of bitter sarcasm. Not only did it come out more when they were under stress, they were fluent in it.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an old-timey word for woman, like dame or broad,\u201d Sean explained. \u201cIt can be affectionate or not, depending on usage. And the user. And the skank in question, I guess\u2014Oh, shit!\u201d Sean scrambled back and nearly fell into the bushes on either side of the sidewalk and kitchen steps. Lara would have laughed\u2014she was the family klutz, not him\u2014if she hadn\u2019t been so startled. She\u2019d barely started to look around when Jack stepped up, hauled Sean out of the bush by the back of his neck like a mother cat with a kitten, and thrust the smaller man behind him.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Sean said from behind Jack, who was almost looming over the scene. Lara noticed Jack was standing very straight, unconsciously trying to make himself look bigger. If he\u2019d been on four feet and furred, he\u2019d be fluffing out his fur and his hackles would be up. \u201cI feel so treasured and safe. My hero!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Jack muttered, blushing red so quickly Lara worried he was headed for an aneurysm. \u201cI\u2014don\u2019t know why I did that.\u201d</p><p>Lara did. Beta males looked after the cubs\u2014and the younger siblings. There were no cubs to look after yet. But something had scared Sean and instinct had kicked in, and Jack had acted without analyzing.</p> <p>\u201cIf there wasn\u2019t a dead body here, I\u2019d kiss you,\u201d Lara vowed, earning a snort of disgust from her brother and a look of surprised pleasure from her mate.</p><p>\u201cAh, thank you, Lara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t a dead body, you dim skank.\u201d</p><p>She bent over the body. \u201cHey!\u201d She could have sworn\u2014</p><p>\u201cYeah. He\u2019s alive. That\u2019s what freaked me out. What does it say about me that I was less traumatized when I thought he was dead?\u201d Sean peeked around Jack\u2019s shoulder. \u201cSee? He\u2019s breathing. He was so still before, and, um, a little stinky, so I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is good,\u201d Lara said firmly. She climbed the step, popped open the screen door, and called for Kara to come. Then she shut the door, turned, and knelt by the \u201cbody\u201d and touched his shoulder. \u201cA dead human who isn\u2019t dead is a terrific improvement . . . Sir? Are you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, are you comfortable on the cement steps all sprawled out like that? Can we get you a lemonade?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, Sean.\u201d Lara sighed.</p><p>\u201cOw,\u201d the body moaned, stirring. When he moved, Lara got a stronger whiff. Yeesh. She completely understood Sean\u2019s error. The man stank, which hadn\u2019t surprised her when she thought he was a corpse. He didn\u2019t need a shower; he hadn\u2019t soiled himself. He smelled like . . . like death and poison poured into the same bag of skin. \u201cStupid chemo\u2014Wha\u2019 happen?\u201d</p><p>Lara helped the man sit up. He\u2019d gotten a nasty scrape on his cheek when he\u2019d fallen, and his forehead was trickling blood. Sean was hanging back, still spooked, and not just by the smell. Jack, by contrast, was crowding, his knee touching her shoulder as she knelt beside the bod\u2014the man. \u201cWhat happened to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014You!\u201d The man, bald except for a few gray wisps decorating the skin above his ears and the back of his neck, jerked away from her touch; he looked up and saw Sean and recoiled. \u201cAnd you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d Sean snapped his fingers, blue eyes narrowing. \u201cI know you. The beady eyes, the furtive expression, the catcher\u2019s-mitt-sized hands perfect for snapping bra straps\u2014Geoff\u2019s dad!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jack and Lara said at once.</p><p>\u201cYou leave my boy out of this!\u201d The man was struggling to stand but was so weak and smelly he was making no progress. It was like watching a dazed turtle on its back struggling to turn over. \u201cHe\u2019s not part of this!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeff\u2019s dad?\u201d Jack asked. \u201cIs that what you said?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot Jeff, Geoff. Okay . . . Lara, you know how Dad has two stories about us he uses as prime examples of our basic personality types, and how he uses them as examples or points of discussion ad nauseam and we were sick to death of both of them before puberty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, for my story, the day on the beach\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeff, Geoff, and Ryan!\u201d Lara looked at the man with new interest. \u201cHuh. What are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think your emphasis is wrong; I think it\u2019s what are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d Geoff\u2019s dad said, squinting up at them. \u201cHow do you even know my boy\u2019s friends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFamily lore; it\u2019s boring, never mind. Yeah, this is his dad, I recognize the\u2014that\u2019s why you smell!\u201d He turned back to Lara. \u201cGeoff\u2019s uncle and grandpa died of cancer when we were in middle school. He\u2019s got it, too! He smells like cancer and chemo!\u201d He actually hopped a little in the joy and relief of solving the puzzle. \u201cYay!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSean.\u201d</p><p>Her brother flinched back from her and she was sorry to see it\u2014and glad. Because she loved him and would die for him or kill for him, yes, of course, one of those things that went without saying even though people said them, but at the end of the day, she was his leader and some things were unacceptable. She knew he hadn\u2019t meant what he\u2019d said, or how it had come across. She also knew reparation was owed, regardless of the man\u2019s motives.</p><p>Sean turned at once to Geoff\u2019s dad, who was staring up at him. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I didn\u2019t mean it like that; I was worried about what\u2019s been happening around here and was glad I recognized you, not glad you\u2019ve got cancer. I\u2019m so sorry. You\u2014you don\u2019t have long, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I do not,\u201d Geoff\u2019s dad said with touching dignity. \u201cWhich is why I\u2019m here. You and your weird dog-people-werewolf-guys have to get out of here and my friend\u2019s gonna make sure you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFriend?\u201d Sean blinked and looked around, as if expecting to see someone crouched in the business.</p><p>\u201cIs the friend a weird dog-people-werewolf-guy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, of course,\u201d Geoff\u2019s dad replied as if the question\u2014and answer\u2014were stupidly simple.</p><p>\u201cWhich means you\u2019ve been scattering dead fish and bats around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Len said he couldn\u2019t do it or you\u2019d all know, but it\u2019d take you a while to figure it was me. Even if you caught my scent, with the chemo and all, you might not know what you were smelling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, I\u2019m lost,\u201d Jack said, spreading his hands. \u201cWho\u2019s Len?\u201d</p><p>This time Sean and Lara were both happy to have figured it out, and said in delighted unison, \u201cThe new kitchen guy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, shit,\u201d Lenny said from behind them.</p><p>CHAPTER FIFTEEN </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, hey, you\u2019re here,\u201d Geoff\u2019s dad said, relieved. \u201cI fell waiting for you and they got me. So, y\u2019know. Protect your evil henchman. Or something.\u201d</p><p>Lenny, a male about Sean\u2019s size\u2014five-eleven or so\u2014with short wiry limbs and big dark eyes, stared down at the dying human with no expression. That changed when he looked at Lara, and couldn\u2019t stop his lip from curling back. \u201cYou. This would have been on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould have been?\u201d Sean looked down at Geoff\u2019s dad. \u201cDo you know what he\u2019s talking about, Geoff\u2019s dad?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have a name,\u201d he replied, exasperated. \u201cIs . . . is anyone going to help me up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Sorry. We should explain.\u201d Lara shook her head; how thoughtless. \u201cYeah, Lenny here was going to kill Geoff\u2019s dad. He really was supposed to be the dead human, the third pet, found late tonight or tomorrow morning, which we probably wouldn\u2019t have been able to hide like the bat and the fish. Outside law enforcement probably would have gotten involved. Very embarrassing at best, and potentially lethal for a bunch of us at worst.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Geoff\u2019s dad yelped. \u201cStage two lung cancer\u2019s not getting rid of me quick enough for you weird dog people? You gotta speed it along?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you care?\u201d Lenny\u2019s brown eyes snapped with fury. \u201cYou\u2019re a dead monkey too dumb to know it. When you\u2019re all the way dead, you\u2019ll be one of billions. Who\u2019ll care?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlotting his murder is one thing, but watch your mouth,\u201d Lara warned.</p> <p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Geoff\u2019s dad huh\u2019ed.</p><p>\u201cMonkey is to human what nigger is to African American: the polar opposite of cool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut some of my best friends are African Americans.\u201d</p><p>Lara was beginning to doubt the man\u2019s intelligence, or sanity. She turned back to the new guy, Lenny, who\u2019d started that very week. Who hung around the kitchen. She\u2019d spoken to him about telling Kara about the mess she and Jack made. He\u2019d helped clean it up!</p><p>\u201cSo use Geoff\u2019s dad\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a name!\u201d</p> <p>\u201c\u2014to leave your nasty little managerial hints, then kill the messenger to leave a nastier message.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDude.\u201d Geoff\u2019s dad was shaking his head. \u201cNot cool.\u201d</p><p>Why are they all talking like it\u2019s 1995? She shook off the wondering. Lenny was not especially bright, his plan was idiotic, and he\u2019d do something stupid(er) any moment. She just had to pick her moment. Or his. \u201cSo we\u2019ll probably fight to the death now, but I was wondering if you\u2019d tell me why first.\u201d</p><p>Jack looked a little startled at her matter-of-fact prediction of how events would unfold, but she knew he was unwavering in his support. He wouldn\u2019t interfere when she killed Lenny. If Lenny seemed to be getting the upper hand, Jack would pitch in. If Lenny won, Jack would lose his sanity and eat Lenny\u2019s heart, fur or no fur.</p><p>Sean, who knew her best, dropped his eyes and muttered to the sidewalk, \u201cLara, I\u2019m so sorry you got stuck with the alpha card. It so sucks that you have to do this your first week.\u201d</p><p>She was sorry, too, but wishing it was otherwise was no solution and a time waster, besides. She was getting off lightly and she knew it; most leaders came into their Packs after a murder or two. It was the natural order of things; she dared not complain.</p><p>Worse: she wasn\u2019t at all sorry for Lenny. Just herself. She supposed she wasn\u2019t a very nice woman.</p><p>But she wanted answers, dammit. She didn\u2019t think that was too much to ask, and if it was, let the cowards sit in judgment.</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Lenny\u2019s tone was so filled with loathing she imagine she could almost see his words oozing like poison gas from his mouth, his lungs, his body, his self. \u201cYou\u2019re that much of a dumb bitch? Hmm, let\u2019s see if I can put my finger on the detail . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you just tell us and quit with the sarcasm?\u201d Sean asked. \u201cAnd even as I asked you that, I became aware of the irony.\u201d</p><p>Lara laughed in spite of herself.</p><p>\u201cThis is why my son never liked you,\u201d Geoff\u2019s dad said with odd piety. \u201cNobody ever knows what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you and yours are freaks!\u201d Lenny burst out. Lara had the impression he\u2019d wanted to make that statement for some time. Years? \u201cIn one generation, your sire tore through centuries of tradition! We used to keep to ourselves; we used to let the monkeys be monkeys and the Pack be Pack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou forget,\u201d Lara said mildly, \u201cI\u2019m half monkey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe both are.\u201d Sean stepped up, then leaned over and whispered to Geoff\u2019s dad, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry about how we keep saying the M-word, we don\u2019t approve at all, but I can\u2019t let my sister swing out there by herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget? None of us can forget! Your sire is dumb enough to get stuck in a city hours before his Change, fucks your monkey mom, then brings her home! Where, after she whelped you, she then set about fucking with the natural order of things, a way of life that went just fine for thousands of years without her input, thanks.</p><p>\u201cAnd if all that wasn\u2019t treacherous enough\u2014\u201d</p><p>Lara nodded encouragingly. Now we\u2019re getting to it. Finally. Thank goodness bad guys always had the need to rant, a quality she had never understood (it wasn\u2019t enough he hated her family; he had to explain his hatred. Just kill her and be done!), but was grateful this once.</p><p>\u201c\u2014then she and her useless mate make friends with vampires and mermaids\u2014leeches and fish, for God\u2019s sake, like they can ever be one of us!\u2014and they\u2019re raising you to be just as inefficient and weak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I was a raging vamp-o-phobe and mer-o-phobe, I\u2019d be mad, too,\u201d Sean admitted.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s made you think the Pack is run by committee.\u201d Lenny was so furious he was actually spitting while he raved. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll teach your born-to-be-useless cubs the same. So it\u2019s not just him. Just killing him, although it would be really fucking great, won\u2019t solve the problem. The seeds have to go, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh. Seeds.\u201d She thought about that. \u201cI promise you this: one of us has to go.\u201d She turned to the man on the sidewalk. \u201cWhere do you come into this the-world-has-changed-around-me-and-I\u2019m-too-chickenshit-to-adapt ideology?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Lenny and me\u2014\u201d Geoff\u2019s dad jerked a thumb in the smaller man\u2019s direction. \u201cHe used to be the custodian at CCH and we met up and got to talking.\u201d</p><p>The hospital. Of course. \u201cYou understand him meeting and befriending you wasn\u2019t a coincidence, right, Geoff\u2019s dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a\u2014what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe went hunting. He needed a very sick human to leave his love notes. Like you said\u2014even if we caught you in the act or smelled you or both, it\u2019d take us a while to catch on to what was really happening.\u201d</p><p>Geoff\u2019s dad said nothing, just looked at Lenny with reproach.</p><p>\u201cHe, uh, doesn\u2019t see you as an equal. You\u2019re a pet. Like a bat or . . .\u201d Sean shrugged. \u201cYou know.\u201d</p><p>Geoff\u2019s dad looked downcast, then rallied. \u201cYeah, well, Len told me about that. About how you\u2019re friends with vampires and sea monsters and stuff. Where\u2019s a human supposed to fit into any of that? It\u2019s our planet! And you\u2019re all faster and stronger and\u2014where are we supposed to go? If you guys are teaming up\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not, we\u2019re just\u2014\u201d Sean cut himself off when Lara shook her head.</p><p>\u201c\u2014what\u2019s that leave for regular people? Huh? Six months from now, I won\u2019t be here. Where\u2019s that leave my boy? And his boys, if he has some? And theirs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you helped Lenny because you thought that would lead to helping humans?\u201d Jack asked. He\u2019d been quiet so long, if Lara hadn\u2019t been conscious of his every movement, every breath, she would have forgotten he was there.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t try to make sense of it,\u201d Sean warned. \u201cYou\u2019ll talk yourself straight into a migraine. If Packers got them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou poor idiot,\u201d Lara said, and meant it. Fear led people to do the damndest things. She suspected she would spend the rest of her reign being surprised all over again by that. \u201cWe\u2019ve been sharing the planet since your kind were hiding in caves and ours were howling at the moon. Come to think of it, we\u2019re still how\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you pay attention, you giddy bitch?\u201d Lenny nearly screamed. Lara politely pulled her attention from Geoff\u2019s dad and gave it back to the villain. \u201cThe part I can\u2019t stand is you were really going to do it. And nobody was gonna stop you! You were going to betray every last one of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetray? How\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy showing the world our throat! You think it\u2019s a coincidence that we\u2019ve been around for thousands of years?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s longer than that,\u201d she said dryly. Ah, a true super villain: he never glanced at a history book. \u201cSo have the mers, and the vamps, and the humans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s monkey see, monkey do with you, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough,\u201d Jack snapped, moving forward, but she put her hand on his chest and he stopped.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Len had lost the power to hurt her, if he\u2019d ever had it. She had zero respect for him, so what did his taunts matter? It was like listening to a recording of swear words: they were words. Without something significant behind them, they were gabble. \u201cKeep going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell\u2014\u201d Lenny lost a little steam. \u201cI\u2019m done, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Have you even met a vampire? Or one of the Folk? They visit pretty frequently. You\u2019ve had the opportunity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have to meet a worm to know it crawls.\u201d</p><p>She managed\u2014just\u2014not to roll her eyes. \u201cSo you haven\u2019t. If you\u2019d ever taken a break from your hatemongering, you\u2019d find they\u2019re like us.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThey are not! You\u2019re not even just like us, you and your father and that mother of yours.\u201d</p><p>Sean shot an apologetic look at her. \u201cThat\u2019s fair, Lara.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cOkay. But I think what I said was fair, too. If Len had bothered to\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, well, people who grow up with cobras spend a lot of time thinking venomous reptiles aren\u2019t dangerous. That doesn\u2019t make them right. It makes them stupid. You\u2019re stupid. You grew up with them, you visited them, they came crawling out here . . . You\u2019re used to it, but that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not dangerous, that we should tolerate them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter because\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy were you late?\u201d Sean asked suddenly, noticing Len was getting into froth mode again. He had no idea why Lara was stalling, just that she was, and wanted to help. \u201cGeoff\u2019s dad was supposed to be dead by now. You said you didn\u2019t get here in time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I had to help clean up the disaster your sister made in the breakfast room with the other freak,\u201d Lenny cried, waving his hands in impotent rage. \u201cIt threw the whole schedule off! Bombed the whole day! Broken glass and juice and bacon fucking everywhere!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t talk about the bacon,\u201d Sean hissed.</p> <p>\u201cI feel better now,\u201d Jack said to Lara. \u201cI was wondering when he was going to get to me. I know you\u2019ll get most of the attention in our lives, and that\u2019s fine, but I wouldn\u2019t want to be completely ignored all the time. Don\u2019t forget my freak sorceress mother,\u201d he added helpfully to Lenny, \u201cand my would-be alpha dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you left time for another villain rant?\u201d Sean asked anxiously. \u201cWe want you to have your say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re all . . . just . . . awful.\u201d Lenny was running out of steam. His plan, never very intelligent or thought out to begin with, wasn\u2019t going to work. Probably wouldn\u2019t have worked if everything had gone perfectly. \u201cJust . . . I hate you. I really do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBad enough to pretend to be my friend, to sympathize,\u201d Geoff\u2019s dad remonstrated, \u201cbut then to kill me and use my body to decorate their steps? I didn\u2019t sign on for that, dude. You\u2019re just as bad as any of these guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuit it, Geoff\u2019s dad!\u201d Sean roared, startling them all. \u201cLara saved your smelly ass by boning a guy she barely knew like some loose skank. You owe the new Pack Skank your life!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo more classic movies. No more classic TV. No books published before 2015. All of it ends. Right now.\u201d Lara pinched the bridge of her nose, where a truly awful headache had sprouted. She\u2019d heard the phrase didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry and never knew how it felt until now. \u201cRight now, Sean. Though he\u2019s right. Jack and I saved your life, Geoff\u2019s dad.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat life?\u201d he complained.</p><p>Some people, there\u2019s just no pleasing them.</p><p>\u201cOkay, fuck this.\u201d Lenny took a step back, his hands over his head as if Lara was arresting him. \u201cI didn\u2019t try to kill you. I didn\u2019t try to kill him. I\u2019m not Challenging. You can\u2019t kill me.\u201d</p><p>Lara looked at him thoughtfully. \u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d She knew other members of the household had been assembling; she could see several through the windows all along that side of the house. Kara had come when called, of course, but realized what was happening and the word had spread, as Lara had known it would. She needed only a few witnesses; the word would get out, as it always did. \u201cI can\u2019t kill you. But that\u2019s all right. I\u2019ll just give you to my good friend the vampire queen.\u201d</p><p>Lenny said nothing, just looked at her with dawning surprise.</p><p>\u201cY\u2019know, Betsy and I have been wondering if a Pack/vamp hybrid would be possible. It\u2019s a pretty exciting idea. But it\u2019s not like any Packer would volunteer for that, right? But it occurs to me I don\u2019t need a volunteer.\u201d Lara smiled at him. \u201cI\u2019ve got you. For what it\u2019s worth, what you\u2019ll do for us will provide valuable research for both our peoples.\u201d She turned to Sean. \u201cPeoples? Is that right? Because we\u2019re different species? Actually, they\u2019re all dead, technically. Are the dead a species?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2014you can\u2019t.\u201d Lara barely heard his croaked denial. Lenny had to cough, and then spit, and then try again: \u201cYou can\u2019t. Do that. You can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll find I can. You\u2019ll find there\u2019s not anyone here who will stop me.\u201d</p> <p>Lenny seemed to realize for the first time that they had an audience, and looked around, his lips moving as he made note of the numbers . . . a dozen, two dozen . . . all watching. All listening.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t Challenge and you didn\u2019t get a chance to kill Geoff\u2019s dad. That hardly puts you up with the Knights of the Round Table, but all right. But you planned harm, Len. To me, to my family. You insulted my mate\u2019s family, you threatened my brother and insulted my mother and her mate. You didn\u2019t think you\u2019d walk away from that, did you?\u201d She laughed, delighted. \u201cDid you? Oh my God. You did! Oh, that\u2019s hilarious.\u201d</p><p>He was whitening, stammering, backing away. He shook his head so hard more spittle flew. He tried harder to speak, and stuttered and stumbled and nearly fell. Geoff\u2019s dad was saying something, but Lara had no idea what; her full attention was on Len.</p><p>\u201cCome on, then,\u201d she said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to keep my friend the vampire queen waiting. You\u2019ll like Minnesota. While you\u2019re able to like anything, I guess. After that . . . well, it\u2019s likely the winters won\u2019t bother you so much. Nothing will bother you so much.\u201d</p><p>Len turned. He ran. Not blindly; Lara saw at once he had a plan, a path. The new plan went much better than the old: he ran straight to the edge of the cliff, and straight over. Unlike the classic cartoons, he didn\u2019t run a few steps on air. He dropped from sight, and even over the sound of the ocean, they could hear him screaming all the way down. Until they couldn\u2019t.</p><p>CHAPTER SIXTEEN</p><p>In all the years Lara\u2019s mother had lived with the Pack, she had never gotten used to post-confrontation anticlimaxes. \u201cThe fight or whatever is over, and they just look for a minute, and then everybody goes back to whatever they were doing. Never ceases to amaze.\u201d</p><p>The witnesses\u2014the kitchen staff, a few groundskeepers, some of the interns from the business office\u2014looked for a minute, then went back to work. If she had called any of them to her, they would have come at once, but she didn\u2019t, so they left. All but Kara, who knew Lara would want her. A quick whispered discussion, and the older Packer was easily lifting Geoff\u2019s dad into her arms. \u201cGet me outta here,\u201d he was saying, \u201cI wanna go back; chemo\u2019s better than this place, anything\u2019s better. Jesus!\u201d</p><p>Sean walked up to the edge of the cliff, looked down, then came back, shaking his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know which memory to repress first. Also he\u2019s deader than shit down there. Are you gonna have some Packers go get him, or let him wash out to sea, or what?\u201d</p><p>Hmm. Yes, that was her decision, too. She raised her voice, called over two of the groundskeepers, and had a quick word. Their baseball caps were in their hands the moment she spoke their names, and didn\u2019t go back on their heads until they\u2019d heard their instructions and stepped out of her presence.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go with them,\u201d Jack said, and she nodded. Then she looked at her little brother. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLies, all lies.\u201d She smiled. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. I wasn\u2019t gonna say anything\u2014\u201d</p><p>Sure.</p><p>\u201c\u2014and don\u2019t get the wrong idea, I\u2019m glad you didn\u2019t have to get ready to rummmmmbbbllllle! Expecting you to kill a stranger after you killed all that bacon was too much.\u201d He looked back at all the now-empty windows. \u201cBut with everybody watching\u2014I don\u2019t know. Maybe they think you should have been more, uh, Pack-ey. About handling Lenny. I don\u2019t want you to get jammed up from that. I don\u2019t want you to have to look over your shoulder forever.\u201d</p><p>Oh, Sean, you sweetie. I\u2019ll have to no matter what happened today. Just like Dad did. \u201cNope. Never happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell. I\u2019m not arguing about it or anything. It\u2019s just something I was wondering about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the saying\u2014there\u2019s a new sheriff in town? New rules, honey. What do you think would further my rep more? That I killed someone smaller, weaker, and dumber than me in a fight I had every chance of winning? Or that not only did I expose and remove a threat to my Pack, he was so horrified at what I was going to do to him, he killed himself on the spot rather than face it?\u201d</p><p>Sean stood there with his mouth open for a few seconds, then snapped it closed so hard she heard the click of his teeth coming together. \u201cOkay. Good point. I withdraw my earlier comment. I\u2019m going to my room now to be terrified for the next few hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She tried not to laugh and, as usual with her bubbly odd beta bro, failed. \u201cThanks for sticking up for me by telling the world I\u2019m the new Pack Skank.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for scaring me shitless pretty much all day.\u201d He pulled her close for a quick hug, and she felt her eyes sting with tears that wanted to run down her face and show the world she was a coward. She ruthlessly quashed the urge to cry and stepped back. \u201cOkay, so, I\u2019m looking at waking up screaming up every night for the next few weeks, but by the time the new fall movies come out, I should be back to a less horrible sleep schedule . . .\u201d She could hear him muttering his fall sleep plans as he walked away. \u201c. . . by then only waking up screaming once or twice a week, so I could go to the late shows on Fridays . . .\u201d</p><p>Lara looked around; she was alone for the moment. Sean off to his room, Jack to help with the body, Geoff\u2019s dad bundled unceremoniously into Kara\u2019s car for a trip to the hospital, and Len . . . well.</p><p>She sat down quickly, sure her shaking knees weren\u2019t going to hold her up another minute. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was another five minutes before she could stand.</p><p>CHAPTER SEVENTEEN</p><p>She ran into Jack\u2019s arms the moment he stepped into the bedroom. \u201cWas it very awful?\u201d she asked his chest as he wrapped his arms around her and squeezed. He reeked of soap; he\u2019d washed thoroughly before touching her.</p> <p>\u201cNot as awful as talking to him,\u201d he replied so dryly she chuckled. \u201cDid you know, there\u2019s a protocol in place for the disposal of inconvenient bodies on Pack property?\u201d He pulled back and looked at her eyes. \u201cAh. Of course you knew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t make it any less horrible. And the day of our\u2014you know.\u201d</p><p>He was still watching her face, his head cocked to the right. \u201cYou were wonderful, you know. Ah . . . not just earlier.\u201d He winced and rubbed his nipple where she\u2019d pinched him. \u201cOur true leader.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head so hard she couldn\u2019t see for the hair in her eyes. Jack smoothed the strands away. \u201cI wasn\u2019t. I wanted my dad the whole time. My mom, too. I kept wishing they were there in case I fucked up. When I fucked up,\u201d she admitted. \u201cI was pretty sure I would. Bet my mom never worried about stuff like that.\u201d She smiled a little. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy, having a mom for a legend.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d been afraid he would think less of her after the confession, but he only looked astonished. \u201cDo you hear yourself?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s such a dumb question. I said it; of course I heard it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not easy having a mom for a legend?\u201d he asked, incredulous, proving that he, too, heard her. \u201cLara, you\u2019re a legend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? No I\u2019m not. The most interesting thing about me is my parents. Them, it\u2019s them. I\u2019m just . . . me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were barely whelped when you took on two alphas in their prime. You broke up a fight for dominance and could easily have been fatally stomped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat only proves what a dumb kid I was. Not knowing better isn\u2019t legendary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know better now,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cWould you do the same thing again?\u201d Her silence gave him the answer. \u201cLara, you drove our enemy to kill himself rather than face your vengeance. Packers don\u2019t kill themselves!\u201d (They did, but not nearly as often as humans. It was almost unheard of.) \u201cIt\u2019s unprecedented! Dare I say, legendary?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou make it sound so straightforward,\u201d she said, uneasy with his admiration. \u201cIt\u2019s not. My dad thinks I\u2019m not afraid of anything. But I\u2019m always afraid.\u201d Even of Jack, although now she knew why. Even as a child, even during her first Change, she was afraid of him because she sensed Jack would change her, and he did. Their mating marked the true end of childhood and entrance to adult responsibilities with far more intensity than turning voting age had.</p><p>He kissed her on the mouth. \u201cYou\u2019re mistaking fear of not fulfilling your responsibilities for cowardice. If you weren\u2019t afraid of letting us down, someone else would be Pack leader. Someone else isn\u2019t; you are. You\u2019re supposed to be here. I am, too.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her again, but she was thinking so hard she barely felt it. Instead she leaned against his comforting bulk and relaxed as he rubbed her back.</p><p>Incomer. That word, thrown around like a swear word. And they were wrong, everyone was wrong; Jack wasn\u2019t the incomer, or at least not the only one. She was, too. Her hybrid status, a human mother and a Pack father, a Pack leader father, an even rarer animal. She\u2019d been raised by parents who didn\u2019t fear change, who embraced it. Parents who befriended vampires and mermaids, who helped them through their crises and expected help for their own. Who raised their daughter to seek out change, and never hide from it. A daughter who would take to mate the son of a self-exiled alpha and a sorceress, and think nothing of something so strange.</p><p>Incomer. The cubs will be, too, she thought, and was glad.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you came back again,\u201d she told him, the biggest understatement she had uttered in her life.</p><p>\u201cWell, me, too,\u201d he replied, pleased. \u201cI can hardly wait to see what happens next. Look what happened your first couple of days! I\u2014\u201d He cut himself off and laughed. \u201cMy dad is going to be so upset he missed all this. I can hear the ranting now.\u201d</p><p>Lara, who\u2019d returned the kiss and was suddenly interested in doing many more things to Jack\u2019s outstanding body besides kissing, stiffened. Dads? Ranting? Oboy. Yeah, there\u2019ll be plenty of that.</p> <p>\u201cWe should kiss a lot,\u201d she said, stretching up on her toes to reach him better. \u201cAnd more. Starting now.\u201d</p><p>His hands were sliding down to her hips, cupping her ass, coming around to gently tug on the buttons on her shorts. \u201cEver the dutiful beta, I obey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, shut up. And do that faster. Why aren\u2019t we both naked?\u201d</p><p>He laughed in her mouth. \u201cExcellent question.\u201d And got to work.</p><p>CHAPTER EIGHTEEN</p><p>\u201cHe what? He just took my daughter on the sideboard\u2014the antique sideboard\u2014like some\u2014some\u2014and now they think they\u2019re mated? \u2018Hi, Dad, we had sex and now we\u2019re a family and I\u2019m likely pregnant, because what birth control?\u2019 They\u2014He\u2014They\u2019re not\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jeannie Wyndham started to laugh and laugh, which startled her husband almost as much as the first piece of news. \u201cKarma\u2019s a bitch,\u201d she said at last, wiping a tear from one eye. \u201cShe truly is. Michael, you look like an asshat trying to claim the moral high ground on this one. It\u2019s done. You\u2019ve gotta suck it up, just like you expected everyone else to suck it up when you nailed me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we all please stop staying asshat?\u201d Michael snapped. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s not that. That\u2019s our way . . . sometimes . . . though going out on a date or two wouldn\u2019t have been out of the question . . . The sideboard. That\u2019s the problem. It\u2019s an antique! My great-grandmother found it in the basement of the Old Yarmouth Inn and spent years restoring it! Respect for antiques, was that too much to ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCareful, Mikey,\u201d Jeannie teased. \u201cYou\u2019re the one sounding like an antique.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut on the sideboard? Is that why Sean won\u2019t go back in there? The poor kid\u2019s been traumatized, the whole staff\u2019s probably traumatized, and I\u2019ll bet they\u2019ve ruined the finish. And where\u2019s the body of the idiot who thought he could scare my kid into being as stupid as he was? It\u2019s gonna be a while before we go out of town again, goddammit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe sideboard survived hurricanes. It\u2019ll bear up under your daughter\u2019s ass imprint.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, goddammit . . .\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
