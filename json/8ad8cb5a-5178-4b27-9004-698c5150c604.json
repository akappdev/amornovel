Not decay, like I\u2019d expected after being called to the site of a homicide, but cremains and trash.</p><p>Spotlights and flashlights lit the darkened alley, casting eerie shadows onto the asphalt and against the brick of the surrounding buildings. It was enough to make a person imagine threats that didn\u2019t exist, monsters hiding in the shadows. Surreal.</p><p>The alleyway behind La Maison wasn\u2019t exactly as nice as the lobby of the chic Chicago hotel, and the night air was cooling quickly. I glanced longingly toward the back door of the building and clutched my blazer a little tighter around me, wishing I\u2019d worn pants instead of a skirt for once. Inside the hotel door lay the kitchen, and past that was one of the nicest lounge bars in the city, as well as a first-rate restaurant. Putting on my cop face\u2014a slightly knowing smile that my friend Mac called \u201csmug with a touch of haughty\u201d\u2014I followed Astrid into the Dumpster- filled alley where a metal trash can seemed to be the source of the ashy scent wafting down the street.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m Astrid Holmes, and this is Marisol Whitman.\u201d</p><p>Astrid flashed her badge at a police officer and a man in a crime scene investigator\u2019s jacket. I did the same. This was her case, so I\u2019d follow her lead. \u201cWhat do we got?\u201d she asked, her voice almost too official.</p><p>The CSI spoke first. \u201cFreak squad, huh? Looks like a body, burned.\u201d</p><p>Neither Astrid nor I so much as blinked at his rude greeting. It wasn\u2019t the first time we\u2019d been called freaks, and it almost certainly wouldn\u2019t be the last.</p><p>At our lack of reactions, the CSI continued. \u201cWe won\u2019t know for sure until we get the cremated remains back to the lab, but we\u2019ve got bits of teeth, some melted fillings, and small pieces of bone.\u201d Again the middle-aged man in the CSI jacket paused as if waiting for a dramatic response. The Chicago wind kicked up, and the ash smell grew even more pungent. Something living had definitely burned here.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got guys going through this Dumpster again, and a couple of teams checking out the Dumpsters nearby,\u201d the uniform said, giving the other man a bored glance. \u201cJust in case some evidence was stuffed into one of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho found the victim?\u201d Astrid asked.</p><p>\u201cKitchen manager of the bakery.\u201d He nodded to a building on the opposite side of the alley from the hotel.</p><p>\u201cSays he saw someone heading outta here fast, around four thirty this morning, but he didn\u2019t get a good look at him. Big guy, he said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo wonder he didn\u2019t see much out here,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>Sure, there was a lot of light with our equipment in the area, but otherwise the whole shadowy space would only have been lit by a single standing streetlamp. I squinted at the light.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, especially since it happened in the middle of the night\u2014well, technically early this morning. The man who chased the guy called us, but since he couldn\u2019t say for sure what the guy was doing, a unit didn\u2019t get out here until ten this morning. It took us a while to figure out the ashes were human, then we didn\u2019t know whether it was one of yours or not. Lieutenant said to call in your sensitive, though. That she\u2019d be able to tell.\u201d</p><p>Astrid\u2019s attention had slipped away from our conversation, and her gaze was affixed on the metal trash barrel less than twenty feet away. As a sensitive\u2014a human naturally gifted with the ability to feel magic and energy\u2014 she was probably itching to check out the remains.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go have a look-see,\u201d I suggested. \u201cI\u2019ll finish up here.\u201d</p><p>Astrid\u2019s eyes widened and she nodded, then hurried away. The girl really needed to work on her cop face.</p><p>I gleaned a few more bits of information from the uniform, who was more than willing to talk the case with an attractive succubus. Yes, they\u2019d questioned the manager.</p><p>No, he didn\u2019t seem like he was hiding anything. No, they hadn\u2019t found anything else to suggest this was a murder scene, but their techs were scouring the area for blood as we spoke.</p><p>Unfortunately, my succubus powers weren\u2019t very helpful with gaining more information from a fellow cop who was already being forthright. Although my unconscious powers were likely loosening his tongue, between my questions he just jabbered incessantly about things like the weather and my eyes. Poor thing probably thought he was flirting. Luckily for me and my job security, unconscious powers were not illegal to use\u2014they were just a part of an otherworlder. That\u2019s why lots of police departments and government agencies loved to use vampire interrogators. The aura of fear vamps carried was an effective tool to get people to cooperate. A sexy aura didn\u2019t always work as well as fear.</p><p>Astrid caught my eye as I interrogated the cop. Facing us, she stood over the metal barrel, hands open, palms down over the trash container. She didn\u2019t seem to be touching anything but was as close as humanly possible without violating any evidence-handling rules.</p> <p>She frowned and then walked around the barrel, turning so her back faced our small group. I waved the officer off and walked toward her. Careful to keep my heels quiet against the asphalt, I gave her a wide berth and made my way around to stand a few feet in front of her, but off to the side.</p><p>As I took in her expression, I smiled. Her brows were drawn together as she concentrated. Her mouth formed a sour expression, like she sucked on a lemon. When her features were taken together, her expression was truly dramatic and altogether silly.</p><p>Suddenly, she let out a small sigh and her face relaxed.</p><p>She opened her eyes and gave me a level look. \u201cPlease quit staring at me. It makes me paranoid about how I look when I need to be concentrating.\u201d</p><p>My cheeks heated, I muttered an apology, and then turned my attention to the asphalt around me.</p><p>\u201cActually, if you wouldn\u2019t mind...\u201d Astrid\u2019s voice was hesitant.</p><p>I raised an eyebrow at her. \u201cWhat? I\u2019m not watching, I swear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s just...it\u2019s harder to get a read if an OW is nearby. Muddles things up a bit.\u201d</p><p>Oh. No wonder. Astrid could feel the energies of any otherworlders around her. If I lingered, my succubus energy could drown out or jumble any traces she might pick up from the remains. \u201cGot it,\u201d I said, making myself scarce. I went to look for the uniform and CSI who\u2019d first talked to us. Couldn\u2019t hurt to make sure we\u2019d gotten every bit of information from them possible.</p><p>Interrogation was what I was good at, after all.</p><p>Light from the window pressed against my eyelids, and I threw an arm over my face. Damn curtains. I\u2019d been more than a little drunk when Astrid had dropped me off the night before. What had I done? Opened them?</p><p>Astrid convinced me that getting a drink after our sweep of the crime scene left us with little to go on until we got some lab work back. Then we lamented over our normally laughable cases, and having someone on the less-dangerous end of the Otherworlder scale to talk to made me feel like I wasn\u2019t alone in my general assignment of crappy cases. A fact that didn\u2019t make me feel a whole lot better that I was usually relegated to interrogating suspects in the safety of the station. At least Astrid caught good cases because of her vampire partner sometimes, although she was lucky they let her out of the office with Claude out of town.</p><p>I tottered to the bathroom and stepped into the shower, yelping as the cold water hit me. Slowly, my brain unfuzzied and I was able to dress with a modicum of stability and care. I carefully applied makeup and styled my long blond hair into a loose chignon. Satisfied with my appearance, I wandered down to the kitchen, grabbed my teakettle from the stove, and filled it.</p><p>It had been a long time since I\u2019d allowed myself to get more than just tipsy, even with people I trusted.</p><p>The source of the stress I\u2019d needed to drink off was none other than my boss. Lieutenant Vasquez\u2019s face flashed in my mind and I pushed down the anger that followed. I was a good cop, even if he thought I was nothing more than a bit of fluff, a conwoman who could get men to confess with her false charm. And I was good at training new detectives, even if Vasquez never gave my partners and me any particularly challenging cases.</p><p>I reached into the cupboard next to the stove and pulled out a teabag, then grabbed a cup from another cabinet. It wasn\u2019t entirely Vasquez\u2019s fault. I knew that.</p><p>New detectives rarely got the toughest cases, especially when they were partnered with a succubus. As far as otherworlders went, succubi weren\u2019t the toughest\u2014or anywhere near the most fearsome\u2014species. Not that we couldn\u2019t be stronger than the average human, but that required feeding. And in order to stay sane, that would necessitate, at the very least, a long-term partner.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t had even a boyfriend in years. Not since before Elaine was attacked.</p><p>The teakettle whistled, and I suppressed a sigh of pure self-pity. The clock read ten, and some terribly important shoes awaited Elaine at the mall. Shoes she needed my credit card to purchase.</p><p>\u201cElaine!\u201d I yelled at the open loft area that led to Elaine\u2019s bedroom. \u201cTime to get up. Shopping was your idea.\u201d</p><p>I grabbed the newspaper off the front step, wandered back to the kitchen, and opened it. As I listened for the sound of the upstairs shower, I scanned the articles. Getting Elaine up and around had never been an issue until she\u2019d started college, and she rarely stayed out obscenely late, but her new ability to sleep well past what the rest of the world considered morning was another small adjustment.</p><p>When silence still permeated the house after I\u2019d made it to the comics, I poured myself another cup of tea and hiked up the stairs. Elaine\u2019s shift from shut-in to social butterfly had gone clear past normal kid and into the realm of super student. She managed to hold a very aggressive academic schedule and do very well at it. But how did she expect to add a part-time job onto her load when she couldn\u2019t even get herself up? Not that she\u2019d gotten around to doing more than talking about looking for a job.</p><p>I paused. She never slept with her door open, but I heard nothing from the bathroom to my left, and that door stood a few inches ajar as well. Hands shaking, I pushed her bedroom door open and my stomach twisted at the sight of her bed. Corners tucked just so, made in the hotel fashion that I used when helping her put new bedding on. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I touched the bed. My head grew light and I took a deep breath. She hadn\u2019t slept here last night.</p><p>I raced down the stairs to the house phone and hit the voice-mail button. No messages. I grabbed my cell phone and touched the screen. No texts. No voice mails. Nothing.</p><p>I swallowed around the cold rock growing in my throat. With trembling hands, I hit her name on my cell phone screen. She was fine. It had gotten late while she was studying so she\u2019d stayed with Wendy. Or maybe they\u2019d gone to a party and she was passed out on the floor somewhere. I\u2019d kill her when I found her.</p> <p>The phone rang a few times, and then a computerized voice came onto the line, informing me that the person I had called was unavailable and could I please leave a message.</p><p>Eyes burning, I took a deep breath. \u201cHey, it\u2019s me.\u201d I was going for light and airy, but even to my own ears I sounded like I was on the edge of tears. \u201cWhere are you?</p><p>Call me as soon as you get this.\u201d I hit end and concentrated on my breathing. I had to stay calm. She was fine, and calling her friends while hysterical wasn\u2019t going to make her happy with me. But the possibility that something was really wrong was too frightening. I couldn\u2019t be worried about embarrassing her.</p><p>I hit Wendy\u2019s number and concentrated on the sound of the ringer in my ear. Four rings, six, finally Wendy\u2019s voice came onto the line. My stomach lurched.</p><p>Voice mail. Personalized with a message from Wendy, but voice mail all the same.</p> <p>\u201cWendy, it\u2019s Marisol. Tell Elaine to call me ASAP,\u201d I snapped.</p><p>She was fine. She had to be.</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>I flung the door open and strode into Vasquez\u2019s office.</p><p>Ignoring the two uniforms already seated in front of his old metal desk, I asked, \u201cWhere are we at?\u201d</p><p>Vasquez nodded at the uniforms. \u201cGrady and Parks are headed out to canvass the library.\u201d He gave them each a picture of Elaine. Her DMV photo had been blown up, and the portrait looked fuzzy and unreal. The officers got up from their seats.</p> <p>\u201cHer hair is different.\u201d I swallowed hard, trying to rid my voice of its strangled tone. \u201cI don\u2019t have any photos of the new cut, but it\u2019s shorter than in that one. Shoulder length around her face and shorter in the back.\u201d My hand shook as I waved it around my face. At their blank looks, I added, \u201cLike Missy, the new receptionist. But blond.\u201d</p><p>Their wide eyes narrowed in understanding, and they nodded in unison before heading out the door.</p><p>I leaned against one of the guest chairs and met Vasquez\u2019s hard gaze. \u201cWhat else have you started? Did you get the missing person report filed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt hasn\u2019t been twenty-four hours. Hell, Marisol, you don\u2019t even know if she\u2019s been gone twelve.\u201d</p><p>I struggled to keep my voice even. \u201cYou know that every second she\u2019s gone makes it more likely we won\u2019t find her.\u201d</p><p>His mouth was drawn in a hard line, but worry creased his brows. \u201cI know. But she\u2019s a college student. How do you know she didn\u2019t just meet some guy\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wouldn\u2019t do that! She...\u201d My nails dug into the vinyl lining the back of the chair. Telling Vasquez about her past wouldn\u2019t help me. He\u2019d just assume the worst of her, more so than he already did. A boy in her high school had decided that Elaine was fair game because she was a succubus. He\u2019d attacked her, and lost his life for it. Elaine was still more than a little fearful of men showing any interest in her, but Vasquez might see things differently.</p><p>Might decide that because she\u2019d killed before, she was some sort of criminal.</p> <p>Vasquez got up from his desk and walked slowly around it. He reached for his office door and I blinked at our audience. Every eye in the station was directed at us.</p><p>I swallowed a sob, and Vasquez slammed the door shut.</p><p>\u201cLook, Whitman, I know you\u2019re worried\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease! Jesus Christ, Vasquez! What if she were your sister, or your daughter?\u201d</p><p>Vasquez frowned and considered it. I met his gaze with my own and refused to look away. I pushed my worry and fear and dread into my expression, hoping he would understand. Finally, he looked down.</p><p>\u201cAll right. We\u2019ll send out some more officers. But we can\u2019t put everyone on this.\u201d</p><p>I sat down heavily. \u201cWhat about Claude? Is he back in town?\u201d The vampire could help. He had great senses, sure, but even more than that, he had resources in the vampire community. Ones he might be willing to tap for a colleague.</p><p>Claude had never shown me anything but respect, and his good-hearted nature had shown through his actions more times than I could recall. He\u2019d help.</p><p>\u201cDesmarais is out of town for at least three more days, on personal business. He specifically asked not to be bothered, and he told me he\u2019d be unreachable anyway. I\u2019m not tracking him down to help find your sister\u2014who in all likelihood is playing hooky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. I\u2019ll take Astrid.\u201d I pushed up from the desk.</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019ll send out a few more officers, but I\u2019m not taking Holmes off a murder investigation.\u201d He raised an eyebrow. \u201cWhere am I sending the officers?\u201d</p><p>I stopped, halfway between sitting and standing.</p><p>Where should they go? One set of uniforms was already en route to the library where Elaine had supposedly been studying.</p><p>\u201cThe campus,\u201d I said around the lump in my throat.</p><p>\u201cSee if anyone outside the library saw anything. And there\u2019s a pizza place not far from there they liked to go to after studying.\u201d I rubbed my temple, remembering the time I\u2019d picked Elaine up from the restaurant. She\u2019d looked so happy. Finally.</p><p>\u201cName?\u201d Vasquez asked. I looked up at him. \u201cThe pizza place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. It\u2019s, um...\u201d My mind went blank and I forced back tears. What the hell was the name of the pizza place?</p><p>\u201cNever mind,\u201d Vasquez said. \u201cWe\u2019ll find it. Go talk to her friends.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, unable to trust my voice.</p><p>Wendy Larson didn\u2019t answer her door, so I moved on to the other friend of Elaine\u2019s I\u2019d met, Teresa Robertson.</p><p>Teresa\u2019s address put her in a downtown apartment building, and I parked directly in front, ignoring the No Parking signs guarding the curb. I trotted up the steps and scanned the list of names on the front of the building, then pressed firmly against the one that read Robertson.</p><p>Unlike Wendy and Elaine, Teresa was a normal. The fact that she chose to spend most of her time with a couple of otherworlders surprised me, but she was a nice girl. And she didn\u2019t seem to mind that Elaine was a succubus or that Wendy was a siren. Part of a generation where OWs had always been a fact of life, Teresa was a bit more open to the idea of otherworlder friends than older normals were.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d The young woman\u2019s voice was staticky over the line, but I recognized Teresa\u2019s deep tones.</p><p>\u201cTeresa, it\u2019s Marisol Whitman, Elaine\u2019s sister.\u201d</p><p>There was a pause, and then she said, \u201cElaine isn\u2019t here.\u201d</p><p>I took a deep breath. It had been a reach to think I might find her at Teresa\u2019s, but I\u2019d still hoped. \u201cCan I come up and talk to you? It\u2019s important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, sure.\u201d The door buzzed and I yanked it open and stepped inside. What passed for a lobby in Teresa\u2019s building was small, and covered in brown carpet that carried obvious stains. The small mailboxes that had been incorporated into one wall were the only things that broke up the room. A stairwell rose at the end of the narrow room, with a hallway next to it leading to the first-floor apartments.</p><p>I walked up the stairs to the third level and knocked on the fourth door on the left. Apartment 308.</p><p>Teresa opened the door almost instantly. Eyes wide, she stepped back and let me in. The small apartment was a studio style. The bed sat in one corner of the large room and a couch sat against the other wall. A small television was sitting on a dresser next to the bed, right across from the couch. A tiny kitchen was off to one side, with a bathroom across from it. The apartment was small but tidy. No sign any crazy party had happened there lately, and no sign of Elaine.</p><p>\u201cIs everything okay?\u201d Teresa asked.</p><p>Teresa looked like a deer in headlights, and I suddenly realized that I\u2019d only met her once, when Elaine brought her to the house for a study session. I pasted on a smile and did my best to make it soothing instead of forced.</p><p>\u201cI hope so. When was the last time you saw Elaine and Wendy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast night at the library. We headed out together, but they went to the south parking lot and I took the L.\u201d</p><p>\u201cElaine didn\u2019t take the L?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I think she was planning on it, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo she left with Wendy? Did they talk about going anywhere else before they headed home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it sounded like they were going right home.\u201d Her eyes were still wide, like any moment she expected me to pull my gun.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Teresa. I\u2019m not trying to scare you, but I haven\u2019t seen Elaine since yesterday. She didn\u2019t come home last night.\u201d</p><p>Teresa grasped her hands together and tugged her fingers nervously. \u201cShe didn\u2019t come home? That\u2019s not like her.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, doing my best not to yell that I was well aware the behavior was very unlike my sister.</p><p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t say they were going anywhere else. I\u2019m sorry. I just assumed they went home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you ride with them?\u201d Wendy\u2019s apartment was less than a mile from Teresa\u2019s.</p><p>Teresa shrugged. \u201cI was going to my boyfriend\u2019s. He lives up north.\u201d</p><p>I paced in Teresa\u2019s small room. From the end of the bed to the end of the living room. Back and forth. Teresa watched me, nervously chewing on the inside of her cheek.</p><p>Halting in midstride, I pivoted to face her. \u201cNothing unusual happened at all yesterday? I need to know everything. Start at the beginning, from when you met them at the library. Every detail you remember. Every.</p><p>Thing.\u201d</p><p>Teresa took a deep breath and began her story. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I pulled into the parking lot, taking one-and-a-half spaces, then strode into the station. Vasquez\u2019s door was closed. I paused in front of it. Barging into his office not once, but twice in one day? I steeled myself. I didn\u2019t have time for knocking.</p><p>I swung open the door and stepped inside. Vasquez sat across from a man who looked familiar, but I couldn\u2019t place him.</p><p>\u201cThanks for knocking,\u201d Vasquez said, but his voice lacked anger.</p> <p>\u201cNo one has seen Elaine or her friend since last night.</p><p>I\u2019m going to pull contact information for Wendy\u2014the friend she was with. But we need to file a missing person\u2019s report on Elaine now, Vasquez.\u201d</p><p>The lieutenant\u2019s eye twitched at my lack of proper address, but he didn\u2019t call me out for it. I guessed that having a missing sister helped my latitude with him.</p><p>\u201cAlready done, Marisol.\u201d He gestured to the man across from him. \u201cThis is Agent Valerio Costa. He\u2019s from the OWEA. I\u2019ve already briefed him on your sister\u2019s case.\u201d</p><p>The Otherworlder Enforcement Agency was a federal investigative force similar to the FBI, but they mainly investigated crimes that involved otherworlder victims and criminals. Why would an OWEA agent be interested in Elaine?</p> <p>I nodded at Costa. Even sitting, he looked tall and deceptively slender because of his height. I could make out the muscles under his dark gray button-up shirt. He wasn\u2019t built like a meathead, but he definitely visited the gym regularly. His nose was hawk-like and a touch imperfect, like he\u2019d broken it a few times. Black hair topped his head and waved around his face, softening his otherwise sharp features, and I had the sudden desire to brush a lock of hair away from his face with my fingertips. Dark brown eyes met mine\u2014not angry, but hard and closed-off.</p><p>Costa reached out and I met his hand with my own.</p><p>He shook it, his fingers firm and almost cold against mine.</p><p>I frowned and examined him more closely.</p><p>\u201cVampire?\u201d The question was rude, but propriety was the least of my worries. I needed to know who I was dealing with. He didn\u2019t have the slight paleness that vampires were known for, but then he may have fed recently. No fear emanated from him, but that didn\u2019t disqualify the vampire angle altogether, since some vampires exuded more fear than others.</p><p>A grimace touched Costa\u2019s features, gone so quickly I wasn\u2019t even certain I saw it. \u201cSalamander.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAh.\u201d Salamanders were essentially a type of elemental. They could control fire and were resistant to its effects. I didn\u2019t know any personally, but they weren\u2019t the rarest of otherworlders, and most were only slightly more powerful than a match.</p><p>\u201cAgent Costa is investigating the disappearance of succubi around the country.\u201d</p><p>My heart skipped, and I dropped Costa\u2019s hand as if the cold had suddenly been replaced with fire.</p><p>\u201cTell me.\u201d My voice was firm and void of the emotion that boiled just below the surface.</p><p>\u201cNearly twenty succubi have disappeared from various locations around the country over the last two years. Most young, under thirty.\u201d Costa\u2019s voice was deep and smooth, with a hint of an Italian accent.</p><p>\u201cNone...recovered?\u201d I asked, fearing his response.</p><p>\u201cThey are still considered missing, not presumed deceased.\u201d</p><p>I dragged out the chair next to Costa\u2019s and sat down heavily. \u201cWhy do you think they\u2019re still alive?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve picked up rumors of a man who is selling succubi to the highest bidders.\u201d He paused and took a deep breath, eyes on mine as if assessing my ability to take whatever news he was about to give me. I met his stare with a hard expression that seemed to reassure him that I could take it, but he glanced at the lieutenant and waited for his slight nod before continuing. \u201cIt seems he\u2019s selling them as sex slaves.\u201d</p><p>My stomach dropped and the room spun. I gripped the arms of my chair and tried to grasp my thoughts. God.</p><p>With everything Elaine had already been through, it just wasn\u2019t fair. Couldn\u2019t be real. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t make any sense.</p><p>Succubi can kill with their powers. It can be suppressed with drugs or magic, but then they wouldn\u2019t be any more interesting than normal human women. Why target succubi?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not sure. The bit of information we\u2019ve been able to glean is unreliable, and it varies depending on who we talk to. The one consistent rumor is that they\u2019re still alive. And that\u2019s what you should focus on.\u201d</p><p>I opened my mouth to tell him not to tell me what to focus on, but then snapped it shut. My strength was in my ability to deal with people, even bossy, know-it-all OWEA people. I\u2019d get more info from him playing nice than playing hardball. \u201cAll right. What else do we know?</p><p>I\u2019ll need some specifics.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get you files on the victims and the case summary I\u2019ve put together so far. We need to figure out where they took your sister and how. This is the quickest a disappearance has been reported, so we might be able to get them while they\u2019re in the area.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait\u2014when exactly did you get into town?\u201d I asked through gritted teeth. \u201cDid you know there was a danger and not warn us?\u201d</p><p>Vasquez turned a suspicious glare to Costa, but the OWEA agent didn\u2019t look the slightest bit uncomfortable under our scrutiny.</p><p>\u201cI got into town last night. There was another kidnapping here several months ago, and then two weeks ago a succubus disappeared in Phoenix. The one here took a while to get reported, since she was estranged from her family. My partner is in Phoenix right now. I didn\u2019t expect them to hit the same city more than once in such close succession.\u201d He met my gaze. \u201cI got lucky.\u201d</p><p>I flew from my seat and Costa grabbed my wrists to protect himself from the blows I was trying to level at his face.</p><p>\u201cGet off him, Marisol!\u201d Vasquez barked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Costa said. \u201cThat was...a poor choice of words.\u201d</p><p>Poor choice of words. Yeah, sure. I yanked my wrists out of his cool hands and sat back in my chair.</p><p>\u201cI really am sorry,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>I looked up at him. His mask had fallen just enough for me to see that he meant his words. Or that he wanted me to think he did, anyway. I gave him a short nod, not trusting myself to speak.</p><p>Costa cleared his throat. \u201cI would like your help on the case, if you don\u2019t mind. My partner is in Phoenix for a few more days, at least. I could use another investigator.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow wait just a damn minute,\u201d Vasquez said. \u201cThis is personal. No way am I putting her on this. Her judgment is impaired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy judgment is fine,\u201d I snapped, pushing myself up from the chair to tower over the seated lieutenant.</p><p>\u201cNormally I\u2019d agree with you, Lieutenant,\u201d Costa said, voice back to smooth and confident. \u201cBut Whitman is the only succubus you have at the detective level in your squad, and I think a succubus could be helpful in this case. Perhaps you will allow me to consult with her, if not involve her directly in the investigation?\u201d</p><p>Vasquez looked like he wanted to argue, but finally he said, \u201cFine. Though if I think your investigation is in any way harming my officer, I\u2019ll have your badge, Costa.\u201d He turned his gaze to me. \u201cAnd don\u2019t forget you\u2019re not off the hook with helping Astrid. Claude will be back in a couple of days, but she may need some backup in the meantime.</p><p>If nothing else, the murder investigation should keep you out of trouble.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going first?\u201d Costa asked after Vasquez\u2019s office door shut safely behind us.</p><p>I blinked at him.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d he said, one eyebrow raised. \u201cI\u2019m not an idiot. I didn\u2019t really believe your lieutenant\u2019s orders were going to faze you.\u201d</p><p>I cleared my throat. \u201cI need to look up some info on Elaine\u2019s friend Wendy. She\u2019s a siren, and I haven\u2019t been able to track her down. She was the last person to see Elaine as far as I\u2019ve been able to tell. I\u2019m afraid something has happened to her, too.\u201d</p><p>Costa nodded and gestured for me to lead the way. The man was cool under pressure. Most people\u2014 otherworlder or no\u2014would have pressed for more info or shown more emotion when I mentioned Wendy\u2019s species.</p><p>Sirens were relatively rare and almost always stayed away from humans as much as possible. Their abilities were very powerful, and that made normals and otherworlders very suspicious of them\u2014more so than succubi, even, which was quite an accomplishment.</p><p>I walked to my desk, unusually self-conscious with Costa behind me, and far too aware of him. When we reached my computer, I sat and logged into the national police database.</p><p>Costa placed his hands on the back of my chair, and I was careful not to lean back and touch him. I needed to stay focused on Elaine. He leaned forward and his scent swirled around me. Aftershave and something spicy that could only be him. I closed my eyes for a second before I snapped them back open. Priorities much?</p><p>\u201cSo tell me what you\u2019ve learned so far.\u201d</p><p>I pursed my lips. \u201cI talked to her friend Teresa. Normal, twenty years old. She spent the afternoon and early evening with Elaine and Wendy at the library. Nothing unusual. Studying, girl-talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing at all unusual? Are you sure?\u201d Costa cut in.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m sure. I know how to question a witness.\u201d</p><p>Costa didn\u2019t comment, so I continued. \u201cAt the end of the night, Teresa left for the train station. Elaine and Wendy headed the opposite direction, toward the lot where Wendy\u2019s car was parked.\u201d I typed Wendy\u2019s name and address into the police database.</p><p>\u201cDid you get any other info?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. There wasn\u2019t any other info to get.\u201d I suppressed a sigh when the screen came up with little more information than what I already had. I\u2019d figured Wendy wouldn\u2019t have a police record, but I\u2019d hoped she might. It would have made our jobs just a hair easier. \u201cWe\u2019ll need to go to the college to get contact info for Wendy\u2019s family. She\u2019s not in the system. Given the situation, hopefully they won\u2019t give us a hard time about a warrant.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFull name?\u201d Costa asked.</p><p>\u201cWendy Larson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you mind?\u201d</p> <p>I slid out of the chair so he could sit. He pulled up the national database and logged in. I frowned at his list of options, which were far more extensive than my own.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to read over my shoulder?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cThat was the plan.\u201d</p><p>He stiffened but continued his search. A few quick clicks later, he ended on a page with a Skokie address.</p><p>The wheels squeaked as he rolled the chair out from under the desk. \u201cLet\u2019s go meet the parents.\u201d</p> <p>Wendy Larson\u2019s parents lived in one of the wealthier suburbs just north of Chicago. With access to the Red Line, one of the trains leading directly to various locations in the city, the neighborhood was desirable for people who worked in the city, but who also wanted the slower pace and free space that could only be found outside of the high-rises.</p><p>Costa parked in front of the quaint white home. With its shutters and large front porch, it would have fit in a small town in the southern part of the country more so than a Chicago suburb, and I wondered if her parents actually used the old wooden swing that hung on the porch.</p><p>I knocked on the door, trying to ignore the sensation of Valerio Costa\u2019s body standing so close behind mine. The coolness that had clung to his hands when they touched me at the station seemed to cling to his whole body, and I shivered.</p><p>\u201cAre you cold?\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, thank you.\u201d</p><p>Saved from his response by the door opening, I almost sighed in relief at the sight of the woman behind the door.</p> <p>Dark brown hair tucked into a neat bun at the base of her neck, she looked so like Wendy that I would have guessed them to be sisters. But Wendy didn\u2019t have a sister, so the tall woman had to be her mother.</p><p>\u201cAnnette Larson?\u201d I asked A quizzical look on her face, she nodded. \u201cYes, I\u2019m Annette.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy name is Marisol Whitman, and I\u2019m a detective with the Chicago Police Department. This is Agent Costa.</p><p>We need to talk to you about your daughter.\u201d</p><p>Her polite smile faltered. \u201cWhat? Is everything all right? Has there been an accident?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe hope everything is okay. And we don\u2019t know that anything has happened to Wendy, but we need to speak with her, Mrs. Larson.\u201d</p><p>She waved us into the foyer but didn\u2019t invite us farther.</p><p>\u201cWhat is this all about?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhen was the last time you spoke to your daughter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI talked to Wendy last week; she was fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs your husband home?\u201d I shot a quick glance to Costa. He was the lead investigator on this, so why was he letting me do all the talking?</p><p>\u201cNo. Frank is out of town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d like to speak with him, as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s quite unreachable. And he hasn\u2019t talked Wendy.</p><p>They don\u2019t keep in touch.\u201d She crossed her arms, and her face hardened. \u201cWhat is this about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWendy hasn\u2019t been seen since last night when she left the library with another young woman who has been reported missing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me? Last night? Do you have reason to believe that something has happened?\u201d Her voice was tight, as if she spoke through gritted teeth.</p><p>\u201cNo...it\u2019s just...\u201d I struggled with how to explain.</p><p>\u201cThe other young woman, for reasons we can\u2019t divulge, is unlikely to have spent the night away from home if not coerced,\u201d Costa said.</p><p>Mrs. Larson let out a high-pitched laugh. \u201cOh my goodness, how silly. You come to my home and scare me.</p><p>Make me think my daughter may be in danger or hurt. All because some overprotective parents can\u2019t believe their daughter stayed out overnight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s n-not\u2014\u201d I stumbled over my words, trying to figure out how to explain in a way that wouldn\u2019t sound stupid.</p><p>Her amusement dropped as suddenly as it appeared.</p><p>\u201cGet out. Get out of my house.\u201d She stomped a foot and pointed at the front door. \u201cI don\u2019t need you people coming in, worrying us. Take your prejudices elsewhere.\u201d</p><p>I looked at Costa, desperate for him to say something, do something, but instead he reached out and gripped my elbow, hand still cool against my skin, even through my blouse. Lightly, he tugged me toward the door.</p><p>I searched my mind for a response, any kind of response to make her take us seriously, but it was as if all my training had never happened, all of my experience was null and void. As we stepped through the doorway, Mrs. Larson barely waited for us to clear the frame before slamming the door behind us.</p><p>\u201cSo what was that, exactly?\u201d I finally asked as we waited in line for a table at The Grill House.</p><p>Costa glanced at me, and though I tried to keep the anger boiling in my stomach off my face, I wasn\u2019t entirely certain I was successful.</p><p>\u201cShe hasn\u2019t talked to her daughter in more than a week. I\u2019d be surprised if she spoke with her any more often than the occasional birthday or holiday. We weren\u2019t going to get any information out of her.\u201d</p><p>I tapped my foot and stared at his calm face. \u201cHow do you know that? We barely got anything out of the woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been doing this a long time.\u201d</p><p>I crossed my arms and raised my eyebrows at him.</p><p>\u201cBeen doing this a long time? Can you vague that up a bit more for me?\u201d</p><p>A grin touched his lips, and the small expression transformed his face from merely handsome to dangerous.</p><p>\u201cAll right, if you\u2019re going to demand all my secrets. She was hazy as to when she\u2019d last talked to her daughter.</p><p>Not like she was hiding something, but like she wasn\u2019t sure or didn\u2019t want to admit how long it had been. She was practically bathed in guilt. Something has happened in that family to alienate their daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHumph,\u201d I said. \u201cLet me guess\u2014given enough time you could have figured out what that was without her saying.\u201d</p><p>His grin broke into a full smile, and I found myself smiling in return. \u201cI could probably make a few good guesses now.\u201d</p><p>I made a whoop-de-do gesture with my hand and turned to smile at the hostess. I considered telling Costa that I\u2019d gotten the same impressions he had from Mrs.</p><p>Larson, but decided against it. Being underestimated was something I was really good at, and it might be my only advantage with the OWEA agent. I\u2019d check Wendy\u2019s phone records, but I imagined it had been quite a long time since she\u2019d talked to her parents.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s probably because she\u2019s in college,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>I frowned. I hadn\u2019t meant to speak aloud. \u201cWendy\u2019s mom. I\u2019ll bet she doesn\u2019t talk to Wendy much because her daughter\u2019s in college.\u201d</p><p>His brows drew together like he wanted to ask more, but the hostess interrupted us. \u201cDetective,\u201d she said, \u201cwe have a table ready for you and your friend.\u201d She turned her smile to Costa and he nodded at her, his face once again covered by the serious mask that seemed to be his default expression to the world.</p><p>She seated us in a booth and the waitress who moved in to take our order was one I knew by sight, if not by name. Bright blue hair spiked on top of her head to form something that reminded me of blue fire. A professional smile was affixed to her face.</p><p>\u201cHi there, I\u2019m Lisa. Can I get you guys something to drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWater,\u201d Costa said.</p><p>\u201cLemon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you.\u201d</p><p>She turned her attention to me. \u201cAnd for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHot tea, please.\u201d I gave her my practiced smile before looking back to Costa as she hurried away from the table.</p><p>\u201cSo what you were saying before, about the sirens. I know that they\u2019re supposed to be a bit xenophobic, but do you really think the woman\u2014even though she\u2019s a siren\u2014 would quit talking to her daughter over something like college?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said simply. \u201cThey aren\u2019t just xenophobic. They believe strongly in not mixing in with normals or even nonsiren otherworlders. It\u2019s self-preservation, and you can hardly blame them for it. They\u2019re powers are unique and powerful. People tend to fear them. How much do you know about sirens?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that they have the power of suggestion.\u201d</p><p>That was one way to put it. \u201cIf you hear a siren sing, you do what they want. Period. For a time after you hear the song. The amount of time depends on how powerful she is\u2014but it\u2019s generally thought to be short. Only a few minutes if she doesn\u2019t sing you under again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s similar to a succubus thrall,\u201d he said, bitterness lacing his tone.</p><p>I grimaced. \u201cNo. Not really. What sirens do takes away all willpower for the time you\u2019re influenced, without cost to them. But, once it\u2019s over, it\u2019s over. They can\u2019t control a person or make them forget. That\u2019s why the few sirens who have used their song on victims have almost always been caught and punished.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnlike a succubus, who can ruin your whole life if you let her, without cost.\u201d The bitterness in his tone turned to anger.</p><p>I stared at him. \u201cActually, the succubus takes a big risk using her powers, too, you know. The emotional connection built between a succubus and her mate is lasting, and it affects her just as much as it does him.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, as if denying the truth in my words, and then leaned back in the booth and put his hands behind his head. \u201cSurprised that doesn\u2019t hurt after a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeeping that fake smile on your face all the time.\u201d</p><p>No amused expression touched his face, and he looked genuinely quizzical.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not fake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Your kid sister is kidnapped and you have it in you to smile at strangers?\u201d</p><p>I took a deep breath and closed my eyes for a moment.</p><p>When I opened them, he was frowning. \u201cI\u2019m able to do what I have to do, act how I have to act, in order to stay on this investigation, no matter how much I want to drop my smiling cop face.\u201d I waved, gesturing around the restaurant. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDo I feel like breaking down in this restaurant, crying for my sister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d</p><p>I opened my mouth to give him an even bigger piece of my mind, but Lisa approached with our drinks, so I nodded gratefully at her instead.</p> <p>She pulled out her notepad. \u201cReady to order?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive us a minute, would you?\u201d Costa asked.</p><p>\u201cSure thing.\u201d She gave him a big smile and sauntered off. The man was far too attractive for his own good. Too bad he was so unfriendly.</p><p>\u201cSo, do you? Feel like breaking down?\u201d Costa asked.</p><p>I took a sip of my tea and studied the strangely cold man across from me. He was handsome and sexy in a way that made my succubus side shriek to get his attention, but there was something off about him. \u201cDo you have any family, Agent Costa?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d His voice held no emotion.</p><p>\u201cThen you should understand how I feel right now.</p><p>You should understand the lengths I will go to, the compartmentalizing I will do, in order to save my sister.</p><p>Besides.\u201d I gave him a big smile. \u201cActing is something I\u2019m very good at.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t doubt that.\u201d Costa leaned forward, placing his elbows on the table, and I couldn\u2019t look away from his dark eyes. He opened his mouth, and a small flash of emotion crossed his face\u2014so quickly I couldn\u2019t identify it\u2014then he snapped his lips shut. He shook his head and leaned back in the booth.</p><p>\u201cAre you guys ready to order yet?\u201d Lisa rematerialized next to me and I barely covered a little jump by reaching for my teacup.</p> <p>My stomach rolled at the idea of food, but I forced myself to say, \u201cSalad with chicken, please.\u201d</p><p>Costa grimaced at my order. \u201cSouthwest burger.</p><p>Fries.\u201d</p><p>The waitress jotted down our order and slipped her pen into a pocket at the front of her smock.</p><p>Silence overtook us for a few brief moments after the waitress left. Costa\u2019s eyes burned into me, far more intensely than they should. I was tempted to meet his stare, if only to pinpoint the exact shade of his eyes. Surely they were just deep brown? They seemed so dark that they verged on black, but that had to be because of the lighting.</p><p>I cleared my throat with a light cough and kept my gaze firmly affixed to my tea. \u201cTell me more about the other cases.\u201d</p><p>He inhaled deeply, and then let the air out in a whoosh.</p><p>\u201cThat could take a long time.\u201d</p> <p>I gave him a sharp look. \u201cSummarize.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Over the last couple of years, succubi have been disappearing from around the country. A connection between the disappearances wasn\u2019t made until recently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did it take so long?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cThey took place in large cities, usually no more than one or two per city. Succubi aren\u2019t rare...as you know. And the women weren\u2019t connected by anything but species\u2014aside from being young and attractive. Of course, that\u2019s hardly a rare trait in succubi. Not much else connects them.\u201d</p><p>I tapped my fingers on the table. \u201cSo they all just disappeared without a trace. Any sign of any other connected OW disappearances, like Wendy\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, and we haven\u2019t connected any other disappearances to those of the succubi.\u201d He grimaced.</p><p>\u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean it hasn\u2019t happened. We should look into other oh-dub disappearances around the same timeframe in the same cities as the succubi who have gone missing.\u201d He pulled out a small notepad and scribbled something on it.</p><p>We sat in awkward silence, me pretending to check important e-mails on my cell phone, and Costa going through his notes, until Lisa dropped off our food.</p><p>\u201cSo none of them have turned up dead. Do you have any evidence that...\u201d I paused. I didn\u2019t really want to know, but I had to. \u201cDo you have any evidence that they are still alive\u2014other than not finding any bodies?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated. \u201cA psychic. One of the best in the OWEA. She\u2019s touched several of the victims\u2019 personal items. Some haven\u2019t been in contact with the items for long enough, so she couldn\u2019t get anything clear off of them. But some of the more recent ones she\u2019s gotten images...I don\u2019t know. Whatever they get. She says they\u2019re alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTouched them, huh? A psychometrist, then?\u201d</p><p>Psychometrists were one of the rarer forms of psychics, able to glean information from touching objects. I hadn\u2019t seen many used in cases; Chicago PD didn\u2019t have one on the squad and Vasquez wasn\u2019t too keen on them. They were useless with cases most of the time unless we had a murder weapon. And even then, their visions weren\u2019t always clear. And unclear evidence didn\u2019t make it to court.</p><p>\u201cOne with a bit of clairvoyance. My partner.\u201d</p><p>My mouth dropped and I snapped it shut before Costa could comment on my surprise. Clairvoyants were especially rare. They didn\u2019t just get information about the past and present of objects and their owners, they occasionally got visions of likely events in the future. A psychometrist with a touch of clairvoyance was a stunning combination.</p><p>The fact that he had proof beyond a lack of bodies settled in, and a weight moved from my chest. She was alive, then. Almost definitely alive. That meant I could save her. I could get her back. I could bring my sister home.</p><p>Worry flitted in the back of my mind. What if she wasn\u2019t the same? What if they did something to break her? No. She was strong. She\u2019d been through a lot. And she wasn\u2019t that easy to break. I could still see her face the night she\u2019d killed that boy. She\u2019d stumbled in from the cool night, hair a mess of twigs and leaves and dirt. Mascara ran down her cheeks, carried by long, hopeless tears. And her eyes\u2014they carried a look of haunted horror that broke something in me.</p><p>Ever since, I\u2019d struggled to help her get her life back.</p><p>It had taken a few years\u2014no wonder, considering the psychic damage on top of the mental and physical\u2014but she\u2019d recovered. She\u2019d regained her confidence. She\u2019d started living her life again.</p><p>I was going to get her back.</p><p>\u201cHello. You with me?\u201d Costa waved a hand at my face.</p><p>\u201cJust thinking. What else have you learned?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot much. The kidnappers take one or two per city, usually a week or so apart. They move onto the next city after a month or two, same M.O. We\u2019ve found no physical evidence, no unusual circumstances leading to their disappearances. They\u2019ve all just seemed to be heading to work or to school.\u201d He took a drink of his water, and I did my best not to tap my nails on the table. \u201cLike I said, the only thing they\u2019ve had in common other than their species is their age.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, just get me the summary. And the files. Okay?\u201d</p><p>I took a couple of bites of my salad and then grabbed my jacket. \u201cWe need to get moving.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and took a couple of huge bites of his burger, and half the sandwich disappeared. I tossed some cash on the table while he struggled to chew and keep his mouth closed.</p><p>We made it to the front door before he\u2019d swallowed enough of the burger to mumble, \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe library.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>The library, with its imposing dark brick facade, towered over us as we approached the main entrance. Intimidating, it stole my breath and made my stomach clench, and I wondered if it had made Elaine feel the same way.</p><p>\u201cYou all right?\u201d Costa paused at the entrance.</p><p>No, I\u2019m far from all right. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d I pushed past him and went through the door.</p><p>Washed-out neutral colors coated the floors and walls, covering the fabrics and hard surfaces of the room.</p><p>Students lounged on couches with books, or at tables\u2014 leaning across to consult their friends on math problems or their love lives. A few sat in front of library computers.</p><p>Several stood in line, waiting for a librarian to check out their books, fidgeting and antsy, probably wishing they were anywhere but the library.</p><p>I made my way to the checkout desk, cutting in front of the next girl in line. She made a rude noise and turned to gesture to her friends, who were already checked out and waiting for her near the front entrance.</p><p>The librarian gave me a disapproving look when I stepped up to the counter, but her annoyance faded when I flashed my badge.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Detective Marisol Whitman. This is Agent Costa.\u201d I nodded toward him. He stood behind me, a wall between me and the students. Almost as if he watched my back\u2014protected me. Something inside my chest softened at the thought. \u201cWe need to speak with whoever is in charge of security.\u201d</p><p>The gray-haired woman nodded and picked up a phone from the counter. She hissed in what was no doubt her library voice, \u201cYes, there are some police officers here.</p><p>Yes. I\u2019ll send them over.\u201d</p><p>I tapped my fingernails on the counter as she finished up her conversation and caught Costa watching my nervous twitch. Frowning, I drew my hand back and crossed my arms over my chest.</p><p>\u201cWell, then,\u201d the librarian announced, voice losing all semblance of its library tone. \u201cOne building over. The head of security is the corner office, last door on the left.\u201d</p><p>She gestured toward what I could only guess was the other building and watched us expectantly. I had no doubt she\u2019d be gossiping about us and the disappearance to every student who ventured into her line the moment we were out of earshot.</p><p>The head of security\u2019s office proved as easy to find as the librarian promised, and Jonathan Donovan was etched in bold black letters, dark against the light shining behind the glass. I stopped in front of the door and tugged my hair loose from the carefully styled chignon and fluffed it around my face. Then I took off my blazer. With the jacket on, my skirt suit looked perfectly appropriate. But removing the blazer revealed an undershirt that looked positively sinful. Thin sleeves did nothing to cover my shoulders, and the just-shy-of-plunging neckline revealed quite a bit of cleavage. The soft fabric looked thinner than it actually was, and the ensemble clung to my body.</p><p>For the purposes of interrogation, the showy blouse was my armor. My disguise. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNice shirt,\u201d Costa said dryly. Then he leaned in from behind me, arm brushing my shoulder, and rapped on the door. He was too close again; I could feel him, smell his spicy scent. I resisted the urge to lean back, just a couple of inches, to touch his hard chest.</p><p>The door opened to reveal a balding man. Wearing my three-inch work heels, I stood only a hairbreadth under six feet tall. The top of Mr. Donovan\u2019s shiny head barely reached my chin. Eyes peered out at me through thick glasses, which he pushed up as he examined me. My worry over how Costa would feel about my outfit faded at the look of blatant interest on Donovan\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already spoken with the police this morning.</p> <p>They just left, in fact,\u201d he said briskly. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t have all day to talk to you people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to free more time in your schedule, Mr. Donovan.\u201d Costa\u2019s voice came out rough behind me.</p><p>Mr. Donovan frowned but gestured for us to come inside. A small bit of sweat beaded on his brow, and I wondered how such a thin man could be hot in this chilly office. The room resembled a closet more than a proper office, and the space felt too small for the three of us. I glanced at Costa. He didn\u2019t look uncomfortable. Maybe it was just me.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re sorry to inconvenience you, Mr. Donovan.</p><p>I\u2019m sure that you have very important duties to attend to,\u201d I said smoothly, pasting my professional yet slightly flirty smile on my face. Despite Costa\u2019s heavy-handedness, I was confident that honey would, in this case, net us far more information than his rougher methods.</p> <p>Donovan relaxed and gave me a small smile in return.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind, Detective...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry! You can call me Marisol.\u201d</p><p>His smile grew then dimmed slightly as he shot Costa a less friendly glance.</p><p>\u201cThis is Agent Costa from the OWEA,\u201d I explained, keeping my attention fully on the head of security. I tossed my hair behind my shoulder and Donovan\u2019s eyes fixed back on me. Good. \u201cAnyway, did you know either of the missing girls?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I don\u2019t have much contact with the students.\u201d He sat straighter in his chair. \u201cI\u2019m quite busy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course. Can you find out who was working in the library yesterday afternoon?\u201d I pulled a small notebook and pen out of my inside jacket pocket.</p><p>\u201cWell, you met Barbara Fuller. She was working the checkout desk yesterday, too. We didn\u2019t have any other full-time staff during the afternoon and evening, just students hired through the work assistance program. I gave their names to the other officers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you routinely keep track of who is working the library, Mr. Donovan?\u201d I asked.</p><p>A nervous laugh escaped him. \u201cThe officers who were here earlier had me call down and check.\u201d</p><p>I suppressed a grimace. We might well be just repeating what other cops had already done, but I couldn\u2019t risk not going through the steps, just in case they\u2019d missed something. \u201cIf you wouldn\u2019t mind, it would really help me out to get the student staff\u2019s names as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d also like to speak with Ms. Fuller,\u201d I added.</p><p>He frowned. \u201cWell, she\u2019s off in a couple of hours. She said she didn\u2019t have anyone to cover the desk until then.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCould you figure something out so we could speak to her? Maybe a student who works in the library could cover for her? I\u2019d really appreciate it.\u201d My perfected expression eased into something work appropriate, but it was close to being inappropriate.</p><p>Red splotches crept up Donovan\u2019s thin neck. \u201cIf it would help, of course I\u2019ll see if there\u2019s someone here who could cover for her.\u201d</p><p>He picked up the phone, but before he could dial, I asked, \u201cWhat about security cameras?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but we don\u2019t have cameras in the library.</p><p>No budget for it.\u201d He shrugged and Costa and I got up from our chairs.</p><p>I gave the man a small wave as we exited the office and suppressed a smile as he stumbled over his words into the phone.</p><p>I put my blazer back on when the cool fall air surrounded me, and I walked in front of Costa to the sidewalk that led down into the library. As I approached the door, he grabbed my arm, just under my shoulder, and pulled me to a stop. His grip wasn\u2019t rough, but it was firm.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked, angling my shoulder away from him so he\u2019d release me.</p><p>He let go, and his arm grazed my breast as his hand fell away. I took in a quick breath and glared at him.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell was that?\u201d His voice was cold, but not void of emotion.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d My mouth dropped open and I snapped it shut, ignored the way my pulse skipped faster under his gaze.</p><p>\u201cDo you really think flirting while on the job is appropriate?\u201d Anger coated his tone, giving it a hard edge.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d think you could feed your desires on your own time.\u201d</p><p>Heat flared in my chest and rushed up to my face.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, any idiot could tell that you were coming on to that little weasel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn idiot might think that, yes,\u201d I hissed. I spun around and marched down the sidewalk. What the hell? Did he really think I was desperate enough for a lay that I\u2019d flirt on the job, the day after my sister was kidnapped, with a guy as unattractive as Donovan? Asshole. He probably didn\u2019t know any way to get information out of people that didn\u2019t involve strong-arming.</p><p>Swallowing my anger and ignoring Costa trailing behind me, I stomped back to the checkout desk. Barbara Fuller gave me a small wave. As Costa moved into her view, her eyes widened and then she snapped them back to the next person in line, obviously unnerved by whatever expression I\u2019d put on the OWEA agent\u2019s face. She helped the student, and then moved away from her post as a young woman came to replace her.</p><p>I tapped my foot and motioned toward Ms. Fuller. She walked up to us, hesitant, and I plastered on my pleasant smile.</p><p>\u201cThank you for taking the time to speak with us, Ms.</p><p>Fuller,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d she said, and tension faded from her stance as she examined me. She uncrossed her arms and pointed to a small meeting room next to the front desk she\u2019d just vacated. \u201cWe can speak in there, if you would like some privacy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be wonderful. Thank you.\u201d I kept the smile firmly affixed to my face.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d she said as she shut the door behind us, \u201cwhat can I help you with? I\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t know much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said the police spoke with you earlier? Can you tell us what you told them?\u201d I asked.</p><p>She nodded and her eyes lit up with excitement. I gritted my teeth and pushed down the flare of anger I felt at her reaction. This was probably the most dramatic situation the librarian had seen in her life.</p><p>A laminate table with several chairs surrounding it filled the small room. Ms. Fuller sat facing the door and I sat across from her. Costa eyed the door and dragged a chair to one side. The placement allowed him to keep the door in his periphery while watching Ms. Fuller at the same time.</p><p>\u201cWell, as I told the other officers, I know all of the girls by their pictures. I didn\u2019t know any of them by name except Wendy, though. They were all very nice. Quiet, you know? They didn\u2019t cause me any trouble when they studied here.\u201d She smoothed invisible wrinkles out of her blouse.</p><p>\u201cWere you able to catch any bits of their conversation lately?\u201d I asked. \u201cEven something from several days ago could be relevant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I just don\u2019t pay that close of attention. And like I said, the girls were quiet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you see anyone else talking with them?\u201d Costa asked.</p><p>She thought about that for a moment. \u201cNot that I remember, no. I\u2019m sure other students talked to them\u2014 they seemed very popular\u2014but I didn\u2019t notice anyone in particular.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey seemed popular? Why do you say that?\u201d I asked.</p><p>She waved a hand in the air. \u201cOh, you know. They were just that popular type. Pretty. Giggly. Popular.\u201d</p><p>I opened my mouth to ask her exactly what she meant by that description. My sister was smart\u2014just because she was pretty that didn\u2019t give the woman the right to assume she was an airhead\u2014but Costa gave me a warning glance and spoke before I could.</p><p>\u201cCan you recall any of the students who spoke to them more often than others? Any students who spoke to them this week?\u201d</p><p>I stood up from the table, startling Ms. Fuller. I\u2019d had about enough of her assumptions and Costa\u2019s attitude. If he wanted to ask all the questions, then I\u2019d let him. We weren\u2019t going to get any information from this woman anyway. We were just fodder for her gossip. \u201cI\u2019m going to look around. Can you finish up here?\u201d I smiled at Costa, knowing that for once my go-to expression looked forced, if not outright angry. I turned and left without waiting for his reply.</p><p>The chilly air cut through my jacket as I made my way out to the parking lot. I walked the path Teresa said Wendy and Elaine headed toward the last time she\u2019d seen them. I pulled on my gloves and took in my surroundings.</p><p>The area was bustling this time of day, but Wendy and Elaine left the library late. Nine o\u2019clock. There would still be people around then, wouldn\u2019t there? This was a college campus, after all.</p><p>I could remember my college years vividly. There hadn\u2019t been a lot of money, so I\u2019d settled for a close commuter school that offered me a small scholarship.</p><p>It was enough to get me into the police academy. And it had given me time. Time to grow into my succubus powers. Time to learn to control them and keep them compartmentalized within me until I needed them. Time to start to grow into the adult I would become.</p><p>I\u2019d wanted something better for Elaine. Because she hadn\u2019t had the luxury of becoming a succubus slowly.</p><p>Because she didn\u2019t get to feel safe. She had to live at home, but she did get to go to this beautiful campus. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A campus that now looked cloaked in danger.</p><p>I walked the couple of blocks to the parking lot, keeping my eyes on the area around me. There were too many places a person could have hid along the path.</p><p>Behind a tree, crouched next to a trashcan, standing in plain sight\u2014it wasn\u2019t like that would look out of place on a college campus.</p> <p>The same gray haze that seemed to cover everything else also coated the parking lot. Rain wasn\u2019t falling yet\u2014 not really\u2014but a slow drizzle coated the air and the dark fall sky was oppressive. Cars packed the large area to the brim, and like most college campus parking lots, not a single space remained free.</p><p>Well lit and recently painted, the parking lot didn\u2019t look like the kind of place that women just went missing from.</p><p>Then again, people disappeared from perfectly normal- looking places every day. But two women disappearing together was highly unusual.</p><p>A lone officer\u2014one who\u2019d been assigned to the case while I was in the office with Vasquez\u2014stood by a car not far from where I\u2019d entered. When I approached he nodded to me.</p><p>\u201cIs this Wendy\u2019s car?\u201d I asked.</p> <p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am. Just waiting on a warrant.\u201d</p><p>I gave the small Ford a once-over, careful to avoid touching it. I didn\u2019t see anything unusual. The girls probably hadn\u2019t even made it to the car. My gut clenched at the thought, and the small amount of hope I\u2019d carried that we\u2019d find a quick link to their kidnapper slipped away.</p><p>The vehicle wouldn\u2019t contain any evidence to help us find Elaine and Wendy, and identifying where exactly they had been taken would be difficult. Never mind finding any evidence that could actually be linked conclusively.</p><p>I studied the parking lot carefully. The lights\u2014 something about them drew my attention, but they were tall enough that I had difficulty making out exactly what was off about them. I strode to the closest one and looked up, then blinked at the object adjacent to the light dumbly, as hope blossomed in my chest.</p><p>Security cameras.</p><p>Chapter Five</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you mean, the data\u2019s gone?\u201d My voice rose to a shriek that even my half-banshee friend Mac would have been proud of.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Donovan said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what could have happened to the footage. Like I told the other officers, nothing like this has ever happened before.\u201d</p><p>Sweat trickled down the sides of his face.</p><p>\u201cAnd you didn\u2019t think to mention this to us earlier?\u201d</p><p>I asked. Donovan\u2019s gaze darted to his hands. Of course he hadn\u2019t mentioned the cameras and lost footage. The little weasel hadn\u2019t wanted to get yelled at.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t there some sort of backup system?\u201d Costa asked. He touched my shoulder and I shrugged him off.</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d the head of security said. \u201cThe system records everything onto a hard drive. It\u2019s eventually deleted, but only when it\u2019s downloaded and archived.</p><p>But everything from the last week was deleted\u2014that was everything on the drive\u2014and it doesn\u2019t seem to have been archived. We\u2019ve never had a problem like this before. I\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, you\u2019ve got a problem now, buddy. Maybe you should go find someone who actually knows how to do his job.\u201d I held my facade in place with the thinnest of emotional threads.</p><p>Red-faced, the head of security stuttered that he would get someone on the phone from the security company who sold the school the system, and he disappeared into his office.</p><p>I paced the hallway and Costa, eyes hooded, leaned against the wall and crossed his arms. After a few minutes, I calmed down enough to stop pacing. Donovan approached, his arms and head pulled close to his body like a dog expecting to be hit, and Costa pushed away from the wall.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Detective, but it\u2019ll be a while before I have any information for you.\u201d He glanced around. \u201cI could call you,\u201d he said, hopeful.</p><p>I opened my mouth to tell him that I would wait, but my cell phone rang before I could get the words out.</p><p>I pulled it out of my pocket and looked at the number.</p><p>Astrid.</p><p>I touched my phone\u2019s screen. \u201cHello?\u201d I took my wallet out. Astrid\u2019s voice came over the line as I handed the head of security my card.</p><p>\u201cHey, Marisol. It\u2019s Astrid. I\u2019m so sorry about your sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I whispered. I cleared my throat and shoved my wallet back into my jacket. \u201cWe\u2019ll find her, so there\u2019s nothing to be sorry about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate to ask this, but are you busy right now?\u201d she asked, voice tentative. \u201cI need your help with something, if you have time.\u201d</p><p>I covered the phone\u2019s microphone. \u201cCan you wait here for the footage? I have something I need to do on that other case.\u201d</p><p>Costa nodded curtly, and I lifted the phone back to my ear. \u201cWhat do you need?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo tell me again why you need me to talk to the witch?\u201d</p><p>I asked. Astrid and I stood in front of Natalie Leigh\u2019s high-rise office building, and its shiny walls glittered even when surrounded by dark gray skies.</p><p>Astrid frowned. \u201cI don\u2019t need you, exactly. I just don\u2019t really care for witches, okay?\u201d</p><p>I raised an eyebrow but didn\u2019t press her. Covenant witches were a secretive lot, and I couldn\u2019t blame her for not liking them. Only the vampires compared to the Covenant for political power in the otherworlder arena.</p><p>Witches and vampires were powerful, and more plentiful than most other species. And more importantly, they were two species that were drawn to power. They sought it, fought for it, and generally got it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just wait for you out here. Let me know if you absolutely need me to come up and I will,\u201d Astrid said, her face creased with worry.</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>I walked into the lobby. A large man stood as I entered, and boy, did he stand. He was at least as tall as Costa, putting him several inches above six feet. Where Costa was lean, this man was wide\u2014built like a football player who did nothing but go to the gym. He wore a suit but had the guarded look of professional muscle. He wasn\u2019t exactly my type, but I paused to appreciate the view anyway.</p><p>He watched me as I flashed my badge at the receptionist, and then he took a step toward me, his face strangely intense, no doubt drawn by my succubus allure.</p><p>I didn\u2019t have time to deal with an admirer, so I frowned at him sternly and then broke eye contact and turned to the receptionist. The woman was shaking her head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but Ms. Leigh is otherwise occupied.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s important police business,\u201d I said. \u201cShe\u2019s just going to have to spare me a few minutes.\u201d Not waiting for her reply, I strode toward the elevator, shooting a quick look over my shoulder to make sure the big man wasn\u2019t following me.</p><p>I glanced at the directory. Natalie Leigh, Witch was listed in suite 1400. I stepped into the elevator and hit the button for the fourteenth floor.</p><p>Astrid\u2019s partner, Claude, was a vampire, and in addition to working for the police department, he was the unofficial attach\u00e9 between the local vampire leader, the Magister, and the local cops. Between Astrid\u2019s dislike for witches and Claude\u2019s vampire status\u2014vampires and witches didn\u2019t get alone well\u2014they probably avoided Natalie like the plague. Lieutenant Vasquez probably loved them for it. Witches were tough on the department\u2019s budget.</p><p>The doors dinged open and a plush hallway revealed itself. I walked to Natalie Leigh\u2019s office door. Voices murmured inside, and I heard the click of a telephone being replaced on its cradle as I swung the door open. The receptionist warning the Covenant witch of my impending arrival, no doubt.</p><p>The reception area was empty, but the door to the single office in the suite was half-ajar. I walked to it and knocked lightly. The hinges creaked slightly as I pushed it open.</p><p>A dark-haired young woman\u2014younger than I would have guessed a fully certified Covenant witch could be\u2014 stood behind the desk. She was short, probably just above five feet tall, which made her slightly taller than Astrid.</p><p>She was pretty in the same way Astrid was\u2014a cute pixie face with a short cut that only looked really good on very pretty women\u2014but she possessed an air of sophistication that Astrid lacked. Where Astrid was down to earth, girl next door, Natalie was the understated movie star or politician\u2019s daughter. Her height made her more than half a foot shorter than me, but thanks to the man sitting across from her desk, I wasn\u2019t the giant in the room.</p><p>\u201cDetective,\u201d Natalie said, voice smooth despite the palpable tension in the room. \u201cI understand it was important for you to speak with me immediately, but I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m in the middle of something\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense,\u201d the thin man said. \u201cPlease see to the detective, Natalie. I can entertain myself for a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>He was a slight man, but well dressed and manicured.</p><p>Over six feet tall, he was thin as a rail, something his height only accentuated. Balding, he had smoothed his dark brown hair back from his face and held it with gel.</p><p>The lights glinted off his cold blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Detective Marisol Whitman,\u201d I said, and I reached out to shake the witch\u2019s hand. The man\u2019s spine stiffened, making his posture almost too perfect. Great.</p><p>He\u2019d probably just picked up on the fact that I was a succubus. Men tended to have one of two reactions to my nature. They were either very interested\u2014like the big guy in the lobby\u2014or very irritated. Control freaks especially didn\u2019t appreciate my innate ability to distract them. No wonder I bothered Costa.</p><p>Natalie nodded to me. \u201cThis is Councilor Koslov.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you,\u201d I said smoothly. Wonderful. A Covenant Councilor. Just what I needed to complete my day. I reached out to shake the Councilor\u2019s hand. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry to interrupt your meeting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice to make your acquaintance, Detective,\u201d Koslov said, his voice the perfect professional pitch. He took my hand in his, shaking it, and I found myself studying him. For such an unremarkable-looking man, he had a bit of an aura about him. He was attractive in the way powerful men were, and he commanded attention. To my chagrin, I realized I was staring, and I glanced away. Damn politician. No wonder he was on the council. He had that bit of charisma that all the best statesmen possessed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe can speak in my reception area.\u201d Natalie gestured to the room I\u2019d walked through to get to her office. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back, Viktor.\u201d</p><p>The man nodded, a solemn expression on his face. I wondered if he practiced it.</p><p>Just as Magisters oversaw their pockets of the world and ruled the vampires, the Covenant was run by Councilors. Unlike the Magisters who were appointed, Councilors were elected and ruled all witches in their area of the world. Six councils in all ruled them.</p> <p>I might as well have interrupted her meeting with the secretary of state or the vice president.</p><p>Natalie cleared her throat and I jumped. Heat flushed my cheeks when I realized that I\u2019d been staring at the Magister. I turned quickly and followed Natalie into her small waiting room.</p><p>\u201cOkay, what is this about?\u201d Natalie asked, shutting her office door behind her.</p><p>\u201cWe have some remains,\u201d I replied. \u201cA body was burned beyond all identification. We\u2019ve determined no accelerant was used. We need to find out what else could have burned a body so badly, and whether or not you can get anything off the body to help us identify the victim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow badly was the body damaged? Tell me about the circumstances,\u201d Natalie said.</p> <p>\u201cOnly ashes remained,\u201d I explained. \u201cMostly. A few more minutes and we wouldn\u2019t have been able to determine the ashes were human without a sensitive. Not even enough was left of the teeth to be certain it was a human being.\u201d I took a deep breath. \u201cBut it was enough to get the paranormal unit out there. Our sensitive verified the ashes were human remains, or an otherworlder. There is definite energy on the body that is OW in nature, but she can\u2019t say for sure if it\u2019s from the victim or the person who burned the body. And there\u2019s not enough of it left for Astrid to identify what kind of otherworlder was involved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAstrid Holmes?\u201d Natalie asked, voice sharp.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cGuess she didn\u2019t want to come with you to talk to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s working other leads in the case,\u201d I lied.</p><p>\u201cHumph. Sure she is.\u201d Natalie pursed her lips. \u201cWell, I probably can\u2019t tell you who the victim was, not off a little ash. You might do better with a psychometrist. But I can tell you what could have destroyed the body.\u201d She held up a finger. \u201cA witch, for one. A not-so-strong one with an affinity for fire could have done it, perhaps. Especially if intense emotion was involved. A powerful one with no affinity for fire could have done it as well\u2014although that would have required a lot of time and trouble.\u201d She held up another finger. \u201cA salamander. But it would have to be a strong one.\u201d And another finger. \u201cA firebird\u2014but again, it would have to be an especially strong one. Was there damage to the surrounding area?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, the damage was concentrated on the body itself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably not a firebird, then. They aren\u2019t all that accurate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about a phoenix?\u201d</p><p>Natalie waved her hand in the air. \u201cThat\u2019s just another word for firebird\u2014they\u2019re the same species, really. They just won\u2019t admit it. I guess it could also be some sort of elemental shaman. They\u2019re similar to witches, but their magic is far more...primitive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that I can think of offhand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat can you tell me about salamanders?\u201d I asked, keeping my tone light. I was only curious because of the case\u2014not because of Costa. And if I told myself that enough times, maybe I\u2019d believe it.</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cLike all species of otherworlders, they vary in strength, but they are more accurate than a firebird.</p> <p>Most commonly they are fire resistant\u2014maybe closer to immune. Their eyes turn black like a true salamander\u2019s when they are feeling intense emotion. Most are like a lighter, in that they can start a small flame. They can drive some energy into a fire.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cBut melting fillings...how long did this person burn?\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to say, but it couldn\u2019t have been more than an hour or so. He or she was found in an alley at night, but the bar that used the Dumpsters closed at 2:00 a.m., and they took their trash out after closing. A bakery on the other side of the alley had workers in by four. They found the body at four thirty, and it was already reduced to smoldering ash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like you definitely have something, then.\u201d</p><p>Natalie\u2019s face scrunched, a cute expression on her, and oddly it reminded me of Astrid\u2019s expression back in the alley when she had been concentrating on using her sensitive powers on the pile of ash. \u201cIf I had to hazard a guess, I would put my money on an amateur witch with very strong fire acumen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not the others?\u201d I asked. \u201cSeems like a Covenant witch would be just as likely.\u201d</p><p>Natalie laughed, a light musical sound. \u201cOh, I won\u2019t argue with you that a Covenant witch would be more likely to have that kind of juice, but our numbers are limited.</p><p>Besides, Viktor has been in town all week. No way would one of ours try to pull something like that with a council member in town. That would be...suicide. Professional suicide, of course.\u201d</p><p>Professional suicide. Yeah, right. More like physical homicide when the councilman got ahold of the witch.</p><p>Like the vampires, the Covenant tended to take care of their own problems.</p><p>\u201cAnd,\u201d Natalie added, \u201ca very powerful salamander could have done it.\u201d</p><p>Her points were valid, but they didn\u2019t really eliminate any of the species she\u2019d named, just made some more likely than others. Hell, Mac had found that out only months before. Incubi, cousins to my species, were supposed to be extinct. Mac had discovered not one, but two of them on that case. One of which was a deranged killer, and the other she was currently living with. The fact that powerful ones were somewhat rare sure as heck didn\u2019t take them off the potentials list if extinct didn\u2019t.</p><p>My thoughts briefly flitted to Costa. He was a salamander, after all. I didn\u2019t think it likely he\u2019d come into town early to burn some poor person behind La Maison, but I\u2019d have Vasquez check his whereabouts to be sure.</p><p>\u201cCan you get us any information from the ashes?\u201d I pulled a small, white plastic container from my purse that Astrid had given me in the parking lot. It was enclosed in a Ziploc bag and sealed. It only looked like it would hold half a cup or so of the ash, but probably a big enough sample for Natalie.</p><p>Natalie sighed. \u201cI can try. Not sure what I can get will be worth the amount of money it\u2019ll cost your department.\u201d</p><p>I grimaced but my voice was steady. \u201cNo amount of money is worth a life, Ms. Leigh. If what you find can help us, it\u2019ll be worth the whole of the department\u2019s budget.\u201d</p><p>Oh boy. Vasquez was going to love that.</p><p>My phone rang and I glanced at the unfamiliar number before touching the screen to answer it.</p><p>I turned away from Natalie. \u201cWhitman.\u201d I knew it almost definitely wasn\u2019t Elaine, but my voice still caught with fear and hope.</p><p>\u201cThis is Costa. The security cameras are a no-go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about her car? I saw it in the parking lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe got it. But it doesn\u2019t look like the girls made it that far. It was locked up tight. The CSIs are going to go over it anyway, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s likely they\u2019ll find anything.\u201d</p><p>I cursed under my breath. \u201cThis is what you called to tell me?\u201d I winced. I was directing my worry for Elaine into anger at Costa. I knew that, but I couldn\u2019t seem to help myself. He\u2019d been kind of a jerk earlier, though, so that soothed my guilt a bit.</p><p>He hesitated. \u201cThere\u2019s something else, but I think we\u2019re better off talking in person.\u201d</p><p>I stifled a sigh. \u201cFine. Where are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m at the Hampton, off Illinois Street.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know where that is.\u201d I glanced at Natalie. \u201cNot sure how long I\u2019ll be, but I\u2019ll be there.\u201d I tossed my phone back into my bag.</p><p>\u201cWas there anything else, Detective?\u201d Natalie turned to head back into her office as she spoke.</p><p>\u201cHow much for a locator spell?\u201d</p><p>The witch turned back to me and smiled, and I\u2019d swear I saw dollar signs flash across her eyes.</p><p>Costa\u2019s hotel was on the north side of Chicago. It was probably the closest to the police department within the OWEA\u2019s budget.</p><p>A quick call with Vasquez from my car confirmed Costa\u2019s whereabouts when our alley victim was incinerated.</p><p>He had an ironclad alibi\u2014it was hard to beat the word of a dozen cops and a DA. I trudged to his room and knocked briskly on the door. It swung open and I took a quick breath. A light sheen of moisture reflected off Costa\u2019s naked chest and he rubbed his wet hair with a towel. He stepped back, and I caught the door automatically before it could close behind him.</p><p>I followed him into the room and kept my eyes firmly affixed to his muscular back. It was tempting, but not as tempting as the tight butt I could see the outline of in his jeans.</p><p>\u201cJust a minute,\u201d he said. He reached the bed and tossed the towel onto a desk situated across from it. As he grabbed a T-shirt out of the suitcase sitting on top of the bed, I swallowed. I did my best not to reach out and run my fingers down his hard chest while he pulled the material over his head.</p><p>As he straightened his T-shirt, I licked my lips and met his intense gaze. I knew that the heat I felt was plain to see on my face, but his expression didn\u2019t harden, it smoldered.</p><p>His nostrils flared, like he was an animal who\u2019d caught my scent, and I blinked in surprise.</p><p>I took an involuntary step back and dropped my eyes.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I mumbled. I wasn\u2019t entirely sure what I was apologizing for, but it seemed like the right thing to say. It was the only thing I could think of, anyway.</p><p>\u201cI, um...\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cJust needed to get in a quick shower. You were longer than I expected.</p><p>I took a deep breath, air through my nose, slowly out my mouth. \u201cI tried a locator spell with Natalie. She\u2019s the Covenant witch the department uses.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>Business. Focus on business. Focus on working the case.</p><p>Focus on finding Elaine. \u201cNo dice. She\u2019s either blocked by magic, out of Natalie\u2019s range, or...\u201d The thought that Elaine might be dead stomped out the last bit of my lust.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this information you couldn\u2019t give me over the phone?\u201d</p><p>Finding bravery in my resolve, I looked back to his face. His expression had hardened to its normal cold calculation. None of the fire remained, and I suddenly wondered if I\u2019d imagined it. No. I was a lot of things, but sexually unobservant was not one of them. As a succubus I had an inhuman grip on my sexuality, and that of those around me. It was my natural gift, my natural weapon.</p><p>My natural curse.</p><p>I didn\u2019t think about it much, anymore. But standing in front of him, I wondered if my aura of sexuality affected him. Well, it almost certainly did on some level\u2014the aura wasn\u2019t something I could turn off\u2014but he might be able to ignore it, for the most part. After all, it didn\u2019t make me that much more noticeable than your average attractive woman, just a smidgeon more\u2014just enough to make me a bit more distracting than most.</p><p>\u201cI owe you an apology.\u201d</p> <p>My eyes widened, and red crept up his neck.</p><p>\u201cI made a bad assumption, about you flirting with the security man. That wasn\u2019t fair of me. I know that you have to use what you\u2019ve got to get information from people in this business.\u201d He shook his head and a bit of damp hair clung to his forehead, and I made a fist to avoid reaching out to brush it away. \u201cIt makes sense, your approach. I just...reacted.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, unable to speak for a moment, and a strange feeling spread through my chest. \u201cDo you have something against succubi, Costa? Or do you just react that strongly to all the people you work with?\u201d</p><p>He flinched. \u201cThat\u2019s none of your business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it is. If we\u2019re going to work together on this, I need to know that I can trust you to have my back.\u201d</p><p>His face reddened. \u201cYou can trust me, but I\u2019m not going to get into my fucking personal business with you.\u201d</p> <p>Oh yes. Valerio Costa had some personal issues with my species and me. I frowned at him but didn\u2019t push. The likelihood of him confiding in me now was somewhere between zero and none.</p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019m sorry for how I reacted earlier.\u201d He cleared his throat and gestured toward the desk. \u201cMaybe you should sit down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, whatever you tell me can\u2019t be any more shocking than that apology.\u201d I gave him a small smile, but he didn\u2019t return it. Instead, he ran his fingers through his hair and looked down. I shoved my chin farther up. \u201cI\u2019m fine. Just spit it out, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Wendy.\u201d He reached forward and grasped my shoulder, and for a brief moment I wanted to lean into that grip, into his body. Let someone comfort me for once.</p><p>But I couldn\u2019t do that. For one, he\u2019d almost definitely push me away. For another, it was too dangerous. Comfort too easily led to other things. So I tried to focus on what he was saying, clinging to Wendy\u2019s name like a life raft.</p><p>\u201cWendy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Marisol. She\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Six</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s\u2014\u201d My voice caught in my throat, and I tried to swallow around the lump that had formed. A deluge of feelings crushed me, and I couldn\u2019t breathe. Wendy was dead. Gone. The brave girl who\u2019d defied her parents and culture to attend college. The smiling friend who\u2019d helped bring Elaine out of her shell. The understanding siren who\u2019d helped make my sister whole.</p><p>Costa pulled me close and wrapped his arms around me in an inescapable hug. I struggled to breathe evenly. I couldn\u2019t lose it, not now.</p><p>\u201cElaine?\u201d I gasped out.</p><p>\u201cNo sign of her yet. I\u2019m sorry, but that\u2019s a good thing.</p><p>Really. She\u2019s out there and we\u2019re going to find her.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t move for a few moments. For those brief seconds I leaned against his hardness and took in his clean scent. I hadn\u2019t known Wendy all that well, but she had been a regular visitor to our house lately. She\u2019d always been kind to me and as far as I could tell, to Elaine. And by helping Elaine, by becoming her friend, she helped me more than the sweet siren could have known. She alleviated the pressure of being the only one to care for Elaine, the only one who tried to bring her out of her shell.</p><p>And for that, I loved her.</p><p>I pressed my hands against Costa\u2019s chest and pushed myself back. I could feel the heat of his skin beneath his shirt, and it struck me that for once, he wasn\u2019t cold. I steeled myself and met his gaze with as level a look as I could summon, ignoring the wetness I could feel on my cheeks that now marred his otherwise dry shirt.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know she\u2019s dead?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s complicated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cComplicated? You haven\u2019t told me everything,\u201d I said. It wasn\u2019t a question. \u201cYou\u2019re going to tell me what you know. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, there are things I can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, Costa!\u201d My voice cracked and he took a step toward me. I waved him off.</p><p>He sat down heavily on the bed and rubbed his face.</p><p>\u201cFine. Sit down,\u201d he said.</p><p>I pulled the office chair from the desk and turned it to face him. I sat, keeping my posture straight, careful not to lean toward him. I had to concentrate, keep my mind on finding Elaine.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve recovered one succubus out of who knows how many that he\u2019s taken.\u201d</p><p>I took a deep breath. \u201cHe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, she confirmed the kidnapper was a man, but she couldn\u2019t recall what he looked like. A spell, we suspect. But if he used a spell, it was clever enough that our Covenant witch couldn\u2019t undo it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot surprising,\u201d I said, relieved that my voice sounded far stronger than I felt.</p><p>He blinked at me. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMagic\u2019s a helluva lot easier to do than undo. I mean, if her memory were wiped, it would be like cleaning a car.</p><p>Even though you knew the mud was there, could find it in the drain it washed down, you still couldn\u2019t paint it back onto the car and make it exactly how it was before you cleaned it.\u201d</p><p>He pressed his elbows against his knees and leaned forward. \u201cThat\u2019s what our witch told us. But it took him two hours and a fucking whiteboard to explain it.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged, uncomfortable. \u201cI studied witchcraft, amateur stuff mostly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cElaine had some bad history. I just...I tried to find a way to undo it.\u201d</p><p>He gave me a quick nod. \u201cI read the file.\u201d</p><p>My eyes were suddenly moist again, and so I examined the wall to his left.</p><p>\u201cAnyway. The girl we rescued had been sold to a man\u2014a human. We recovered her because his private plane was randomly searched as he was leaving the country.\u201d</p><p>I snapped my head back to him. \u201cWhat? A human couldn\u2019t control a succubus\u2014even a weak one\u2014for long.</p><p>I mean, it might take her a few times but eventually she\u2019d drain him if he touched her. That doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d</p><p>He rocked back on the bed, stretched, and resumed sitting. I tried not to notice the muscles moving under his shirt. That was more difficult\u2014now that I knew what they felt like under my hands.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019d been altered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMagically.\u201d He took a deep breath. \u201cBasically, someone figured out how to reverse the normal succubus process. Instead of being able to pull power into herself from the person she was sleeping with, she was able to give it. And\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d There was more? Wasn\u2019t this bad enough? I could barely get my mind around the implications.</p><p>\u201cThey removed the...baggage that usually comes along with bonding with a succubus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaggage? You mean the emotional connection, the feelings.\u201d My shock twisted, and suddenly I could barely breathe, I was so angry. \u201cThey made them into fucking human batteries, that\u2019s what you\u2019re saying? Human batteries to be raped and used and sucked dry?\u201d The sympathy that flashed in his eyes was too much. \u201cAnd you knew this. You knew this and didn\u2019t tell me. What the hell, Costa?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he murmured. \u201cI didn\u2019t think it would help, and I didn\u2019t want to distract you from the case. We still have time to find her. We will find Elaine before they do this to her.\u201d</p><p>I opened my mouth, to yell or to cry, I wasn\u2019t sure which. But his words stopped me. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>My voice was thick with emotion, and I couldn\u2019t seem to get a grip on it. I had to. Had to force it down, keep focused. Had to find Elaine.</p><p>\u201cThe process\u2014the change, it takes weeks. Weeks where the succubus can\u2019t be moved and is held in the same city she was taken from. I think she\u2019s still here, Marisol.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou found this out from the succubus you saved?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. She recognized the area she was held in, an old warehouse in her hometown\u2014St. Louis. She knew she hadn\u2019t been moved because it sounded like her home, smelled like it. She grew up not far from where they held her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were able to track down the warehouse?\u201d I shifted in my seat. Yes. This was good. Evidence I could concentrate on, use it to focus.</p><p>\u201cYes, we found it.\u201d He frowned. \u201cBut it didn\u2019t actually lead us anywhere. The warehouse was owned by a large company and just rented out under the table for cash.\u201d</p><p>I pressed on my temples. Something wasn\u2019t right about this. Companies didn\u2019t do that, did they? \u201cWas there anything fishy about the company?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly that it was owned by your very own local Magister.\u201d</p><p>The headache just starting in my temples pulsed harder. \u201cWe should talk to someone at his company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been working on setting that up, but it\u2019s a long shot, since it was rented under the table. The Magister probably never even knew about it. But it can\u2019t hurt to try to get his records.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Great. Yet another thing he hadn\u2019t deigned to mention.</p><p>And getting the Magister\u2019s business records? Fat chance.</p><p>\u201cSo how was she changed? Witchcraft?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s what we figure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo pull something like that off...I mean, that\u2019s complex magic, Costa.\u201d</p><p>He pushed up from the bed and stalked across the room to the small mini-fridge in the corner. \u201cI know.\u201d He grabbed a paper sack from the top of the fridge and tossed the bag, revealing a small bottle of whiskey. Quirking his eyebrow, he held it up. An offer.</p><p>I shook my head and he shrugged. Grabbing a plastic hotel-provided cup, he said, \u201cIt either has to be a Covenant witch behind this, or one of the stronger underground anti-Covenant groups.\u201d He poured a couple of shots into the plastic cup, sans ice. \u201cAt this point, I\u2019m not sure which would be worse.\u201d He downed the whiskey in one quick motion.</p><p>My stomach dropped. A witch strong enough, clever enough, to twist an otherworlder\u2019s powers. Not only strong enough, but willing to do so for money. Dangerous didn\u2019t begin to describe such a person.</p> <p>\u201cRight now, we\u2019re operating under the official assumption that this is the work of an underground group, perhaps led by an excommunicated Covenant member.</p><p>It\u2019s more likely than an individual. A coven of witches with enough power to pull this off isn\u2019t a stretch.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cAnd if they were led by a person with Covenant training...\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t even know that they excommunicated members. I mean, I\u2019d heard that they don\u2019t always accept every Covenant family member, but not about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s rare.\u201d He poured another double shot and grimaced. \u201cThey may not allow a Covenant family member to join for a few reasons; the most common, as you probably know, is a lack of power. They blame it on diluted bloodlines, but it happens in the pure families as well. Genetics always tosses one out there with a weak magical capacity. But excommunication is different.\u201d He tossed back the shots and let out a small cough. \u201cThey excommunicate for crimes against the Covenant, ones that aren\u2019t severe enough for execution.\u201d</p> <p>I raised an eyebrow. \u201cSuch as?\u201d</p><p>He twisted the lid back onto the whiskey bottle and set it on the fridge. \u201cI don\u2019t know, really. I could hazard some guesses, though. Stealing, putting the Covenant in a bad public light for not following their rules. They\u2019re very twitchy about outsiders getting into their business, so I don\u2019t know for sure.\u201d</p><p>I took a deep breath and let it out slowly. \u201cYou\u2019ve known this all along and you didn\u2019t share it with me. What happened to giving me all the case information, Costa?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did it for your own good. You were already under enough pressure with Elaine.\u201d He glanced wistfully at the bottle on top of the fridge.</p><p>\u201cAnother fucking lie. You didn\u2019t tell me because you didn\u2019t trust me. You proved that when you accused me of going after the head of security. What the hell do you have against succubi?\u201d</p><p>His eyes seemed darker than normal, and it was almost as if the whites of his eyes had disappeared. I tried to clear my vision. His eyes were normal again. A trick of the light? No. That was what Natalie had meant by their eyes taking the characteristics of true salamanders. I stared back, unflinching.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s personal.\u201d He looked at the floor, and his jaw muscle clenched. \u201cLet\u2019s just say I don\u2019t place a lot of trust in succubi.\u201d He closed his eyes for a few seconds before turning his gaze back to me. \u201cI won\u2019t lie to you again.\u201d</p><p>My stomach wound itself into a tight knot. He either told me the truth or he didn\u2019t. Forcing him to tell me everything he knew wasn\u2019t something I could do, and badgering him the whole night for his life story was hardly a productive way to spend my time. For whatever reason, he didn\u2019t trust succubi. I\u2019d bet my salary that one had broken his heart way back when, and apparently the man couldn\u2019t let it go. \u201cIs that everything you know?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better not be lying to me.\u201d I got up from the chair. \u201cYou know, there is at least one very powerful Covenant member in town this week. Viktor Koslov.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe council member?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInteresting. Something to check out, maybe\u2014very quietly. But I don\u2019t see a council member being involved in a crime like this.\u201d</p><p>I brushed a chunk of hair from my eyes. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, for one, they tend to be from old, very wealthy families. That would remove the money motivation, and I\u2019m not sure why else someone would be selling succubi.</p><p>Killing, sure, if they hated the species or women in general.</p><p>But selling them?\u201d He shrugged.</p><p>I frowned. \u201cI can\u2019t really think of another motive offhand, either, but I don\u2019t think we can write him off.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and reached into a laptop bag that was propped at the edge of the bed. \u201cHere.\u201d He gave me a stack of folders as thick as my fist. \u201cCopies of our full files.\u201d</p><p>I reached out and grasped the folders, but he didn\u2019t release them. I met his hard gaze and blinked.</p><p>\u201cWe will find her, Marisol.\u201d</p><p>I took a deep breath and tried to clear my thoughts.</p><p>\u201cOkay. So where is Wendy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe sent a sample of her DNA, in addition to some personal objects, back to my partner.\u201d</p><p>My mouth dropped open. \u201cI wasn\u2019t aware psychometrists could do that. I thought they just got images, pictures from objects. Most generally unrelated to crimes. Well, I\u2019ve heard of them getting crime-related images off murder weapons and such, but not random items.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true, but my partner has better luck getting useful information from objects than your average psychometrist. She saw Wendy\u2019s death from her hair sample. The other objects only gave her old memories, unrelated.\u201d</p><p>I took a step toward him. \u201cDid she get a look at the killer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. She got a flash of an arm, some sort of sleeve tattoo, but she couldn\u2019t see any details. Wendy was... Well, she\u2019d already been beaten pretty severely at the point where the vision started.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed around the lump in my throat and kept my eyes on his chest. \u201cTell me everything she saw.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeatrice could barely see through her eyes; everything was blurred. Not just the normal blurring because of the psychometry, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I get it.\u201d Her eyes were probably swollen, maybe injured.</p><p>\u201cThere were two men in the room, Beatrice is certain of that much. One with the tattoos down his arm, and the other she never saw. But while the tattooed man held Wendy, the other man did something to her neck. It was painful, Bea said. And she thinks that\u2019s what killed her.\u201d</p><p>He reached out and pushed my hair behind my shoulder.</p><p>Then, letting his arm fall slowly, slid his hand from my shoulder to my elbow.</p><p>\u201cA vampire? Could it have been a vampire at her neck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe couldn\u2019t be sure. But yes, that\u2019s possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to find Wendy\u2019s body.\u201d</p><p>The unbearable silence of my empty townhouse threatened to suffocate me, so I spread Costa\u2019s files across my kitchen table as soon as I got home and started to go through them. I grabbed a soda from the refrigerator and a couple of pieces of toast and called it dinner, eating and drinking while I read the files. But the words on the pages only seemed to confirm what Costa had told me.</p><p>The OWEA knew exactly jack about these kidnappings.</p><p>Oh, they\u2019d managed to track down other possible victims\u2014succubi from Los Angeles to New York to Denver, one in Anchorage, even\u2014but they seemed to have almost nothing else to go on. The women disappeared from their homes, their jobs, their schools. Most were young\u2014under thirty. That made sense. Top dollar would be paid for the young ones.</p><p>I massaged my neck and tried to think. The asshole selling the succubi was smart. He seemed to leave no trail.</p><p>And he was getting braver. For the last two years he\u2019d been taking women, but no more than one per month. The last three\u2014including one in Anchorage, one in Phoenix, one in Chicago\u2014had been taken within three weeks of each other. Had he streamlined his process to change them? If so, he might plan on selling Elaine and moving her out of the city faster.</p><p>I looked through the city list again, memorizing it.</p><p>Memorizing the girls\u2019 names.</p><p>I filled my glass with ginger ale, deciding I might as well give myself a fighting chance at some sleep. A brief worry flitted into my mind while I watched the bubbles fizz over the ice. I was a succubus, too. But no. I was too old. And I was a cop. No way would they be stupid enough to come for me. And whoever was behind this wasn\u2019t an idiot.</p><p>It almost had to be a witch. Nothing else could hope to bend powers like that. Hell, if Costa didn\u2019t have the succubus they\u2019d rescued, I would have said it was impossible even for a witch. I tried to wrap my mind around a power twisting like that, and I wondered if they only warped the conscious part of the succubus powers, or if they warped the unconscious part, too.</p><p>I spun around slowly in my chair and tried to imagine a nonsuccubus with succubus powers, ignoring the sidelong look one of the uniforms gave me. One chuckled, and I resisted the urge to make a rude gesture toward him the next time I spun his direction.</p><p>I\u2019d almost never tapped into my conscious powers\u2014 the ability to pull energy from others and thrall. In fact, I\u2019d never taken power from someone before. The risk was too great, and it connected the succubus to the person she took the power from. That was risky in all but the most solid relationships. I\u2019d played a bit with thralling when I was younger, but my attempts were meager. Succubi who didn\u2019t pull power from a mate didn\u2019t have much juice.</p><p>I stopped turning in my chair long enough to take a quick sip of ginger ale, then resumed my slow spin. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But what about my unconscious powers? Those I used on an almost daily basis\u2014mostly to get information from suspects. But they also impacted every situation I ran across that involved other people. I couldn\u2019t be separated from the aura that differentiated me from the average sexy woman, giving me that touch of other. It was built into me, into my very DNA.</p><p>Could the witch actually be messing with that part of the succubus power as well?</p><p>I stopped spinning, an abrupt wave of nausea washing over me. Even the idea of taking the powers of another person was sickening. Might as well take their skin and wear it like some sort of creepy serial killer. Only not as obvious, and infinitely more difficult to trace.</p> <p>How could such a witch be tracked down? The Covenant wouldn\u2019t give us any information about members without an ironclad warrant, and no way would a judge give us one that would encompass the entire organization\u2019s roster. Chances were the witch wasn\u2019t Covenant, anyway. They monitored their members too closely.</p><p>I swallowed the last of my ginger ale and tossed the can into the trash bin next to my desk.</p><p>A group of witches made sense. They would have more power than a single witch, and if they were led by some sort of twisted magical genius...</p><p>I frowned. Grabbing my bag, a feeling of dread and dismay overwhelmed me. Was it possible? I took out the single file remaining in my bag. Astrid\u2019s case.</p><p>An otherworlder had been burned by either a witch or a salamander or a firebird\u2014but most likely a group of witches. How likely was it that more than one powerful witch, or group of them, was running around Chicago?</p> <p>Could the cases be connected?</p><p>Costa looked little worse for wear the next morning, and in fact, appeared annoyingly well rested. He sat across from me in the booth of my favorite breakfast place and flashed me a hesitant smile before nodding at the waitress when she asked if he wanted coffee.</p><p>\u201cMy, aren\u2019t we perky,\u201d I muttered bitterly.</p><p>That got me a real smile, which I promptly glared at.</p><p>\u201cNot much rest, huh?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged and he nodded. \u201cYeah, I wouldn\u2019t have expected you to.\u201d</p> <p>The waitress delivered my hot water and an array of teas, along with Costa\u2019s coffee.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I get y\u2019all?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cFruit and yogurt. Oatmeal,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cGive me your ham and cheese omelet.\u201d Costa gave the waitress his menu and took a sip of his coffee.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d I said, plopping an Earl Grey tea bag into the hot water. \u201cI have a theory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d His eyebrows rose.</p><p>I pulled my tea bag in and out of the hot water. \u201cWell, not exactly a theory; let\u2019s call it a loose idea.\u201d</p><p>He snorted. \u201cOkay, what is it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAstrid and I have a case\u2014well, it\u2019s really her and Claude\u2019s case, but he\u2019s out of town so I\u2019ve been helping her.\u201d How to explain it? The theory had sounded so reasonable to my muddled brain the night before, and it still made sense. But getting it out in a way that didn\u2019t sound nuts was difficult. \u201cRemains have been found, but they\u2019re so badly burned they required Astrid\u2019s skill as a sensitive to even be able to identify them as otherworlder.</p><p>The person who was burning them seems to have done a marvelous job. If they hadn\u2019t been interrupted, the body probably wouldn\u2019t have been identifiable as human within a few more minutes.\u201d</p><p>His grip tightened around his coffee cup ever so slightly. \u201cYes, I remember the case. And?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd after consulting a witch, we\u2019ve narrowed down the species that could do that sort of thing\u2014there aren\u2019t many.\u201d</p><p>I took a sip of my tea and watched him over the rim.</p><p>He was tense, almost imperceptibly, but it was there. Were there other things he wasn\u2019t telling me? Did this fit some theory he already had, some evidence he\u2019d already found?</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve narrowed it down to a very powerful witch, a salamander, or a group of less-powerful witches. A firebird or shaman is also a possibility, but they\u2019re a little less likely. The scene was too neat for a firebird, and our witch source thinks that a shaman probably wouldn\u2019t be strong enough.\u201d</p><p>His jaw clenched tightly but he kept his expression only vaguely interested.</p><p>I watched him closely. \u201cA powerful witch is unlikely, and salamanders aren\u2019t uncommon. She thinks it\u2019s likely a group of witches. Maybe the same group that\u2019s kidnapping these succubi.\u201d</p><p>A hint of amusement touched his features. \u201cYour witch hasn\u2019t met that many shamans, apparently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve met a few through cases I\u2019ve worked on. They can be pretty damn powerful. But no Covenant witch is going to want to admit how powerful they can be. It\u2019s a matter of pride.\u201d He rubbed his face. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I don\u2019t see how the cases could be related. Just because the same group or person might\u2014 might\u2014be capable of both crimes doesn\u2019t connect them. It\u2019s a huge reach.\u201d</p><p>We fell into silence for a few minutes. He ignored my glares, and I tried to think through my theory. It fit. Sure, it wasn\u2019t ironclad, but that didn\u2019t mean we shouldn\u2019t explore it. Finally, the waitress broke our standoff as she delivered his omelet and my healthier meal.</p><p>I tried to drop the subject, but it pressed against my mind, my tongue. And Costa seemed to be enjoying his omelet far too much for how angry I was. \u201cWhat do you mean, that\u2019s a huge reach?\u201d I hissed. \u201cWhen the list of potential suspects is so small, and both crimes are happening in my city at the same time, that\u2019s a good reason to think they might be connected.\u201d I scooped up a bite of fruit and glared. Granted, there was only a small chance that the crimes were connected, but even a small chance was too enticing to ignore when we had so few leads. Besides, that didn\u2019t make the theory a huge reach.</p><p>A stretch, sure. But he was making it sound like I was grasping at straws.</p><p>\u201cI mean that it\u2019s a reach. Sorry, Marisol, but it is.\u201d He took a sip of his coffee and then looked down at his omelet.</p><p>I didn\u2019t reply, and instead ate my oatmeal on autopilot while trying to think. This wasn\u2019t a silly lead\u2014and if it was a reach, it wasn\u2019t an outlandish one. Heck, we didn\u2019t have any other great leads to follow.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to follow up on this because you really don\u2019t see a possible connection, or because it might get one of your buddies in trouble?\u201d I asked. I knew Costa couldn\u2019t be directly involved, the dates just didn\u2019t line up.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t in Chicago in time to have burned our victim in the alley.</p><p>He let out a short laugh. \u201cYes, because all salamanders know each other. Just like you know all the other succubi.\u201d</p><p>I waved my hand. \u201cPoint taken. Okay, if you don\u2019t think there\u2019s a connection, maybe you could still help me out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow difficult would this be for a salamander?</p><p>Burning a body\u2014bones and teeth and all\u2014in a couple of hours.\u201d</p><p>He leaned back in the booth and sipped his coffee.</p><p>\u201cNot easy. I\u2019m not sure I could do it, and I\u2019m no slouch in the fire production department,\u201d he said, voice matter of fact. No arrogance touched his tone. Interesting.</p><p>\u201cSalamanders are like most oh-dubs. They vary in power and ability. Me, for example...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty strong in the fire creation area\u2014probably ninety-fifth percentile, if one measured such things. But I have very low resistance to fire.\u201d</p><p>I raised an eyebrow at that and took a sip of my tea.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m quite as susceptible as a human, but I\u2019m pretty weak compared to other salamanders.\u201d He leaned forward and stared at me with his dark and intense gaze. \u201cIf you light me on fire...\u201d</p><p>My breath caught in my throat. Realizing I was leaning toward him, I grimaced and moved back. \u201cSo you burn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, which is depressing for someone so good at making fire.\u201d Amusement traced his expression and I barely refrained from rolling my eyes at him like Elaine had done to me so much lately.</p><p>\u201cSorry that your pyromaniacism is so limited.\u201d</p><p>The mock sadness that touched his expression made me grin. I finished my breakfast and drank the rest of my tea.</p><p>Costa glanced at his watch. \u201cWe need to get going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got us an appointment,\u201d Costa said. The waitress took the bill along with Costa\u2019s credit card. I tossed some cash on the table for the tip and made a mental note to cover our next meal.</p><p>\u201cAn appointment, huh? Sounds nefarious. With whom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe local head vampire. The Magister.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>Costa drove his rental while I played with his radio and thermostat settings. He glanced at me a few times, and even though it was difficult to see his expression behind his sunglasses, I would have sworn there was amusement in his eyes, despite his annoyed tone when he asked exactly how old I was, and if I really thought a woman so close to thirty should play with buttons like a twelve-year-old.</p><p>By the time we reached our destination, I was playing with the buttons for the express purpose of annoying him.</p><p>\u201cOkay, put your big girl pants on,\u201d he said as he pulled up next to a large building that was under construction.</p><p>The skeleton of the building was incomplete, and men worked on the ground to put together large steel frames.</p><p>I resisted the urge to stick my tongue out at him, and grinned, instead. \u201cDo you really think the Magister is going to know anything useful? Not like the man manages his own operations, and I\u2019m pretty sure whoever was in charge of that St. Louis fiasco is...retired. Vampire-style.\u201d</p><p>I glanced at the building material\u2013ridden piles around us.</p><p>\u201cAnd why are we meeting him at a construction site?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s worth a shot to see if he\u2019s rented any warehouses in Chicago.\u201d He took a deep breath and intoned, \u201cAnd we\u2019re meeting him here because apparently, one meets the Magister wherever the Magister will deign to meet.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I choked down a laugh and he raised an eyebrow at me, a small grin tugging at his lips.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever met the Magister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cBut I\u2019ve heard enough.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the impression you get?\u201d Costa switched the car off and turned to face me, pulling his sunglasses down.</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t come off as all that impressive from what I\u2019ve been told.

Sex appeal was unlikely to influence someone as powerful as the Magister, but it was worth a shot. \u201cReady?\u201d I gave Costa my charming smile.</p><p>His eyes lingered on my bright lips for a second then he frowned and put his sunglasses back on. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p> <p>I followed Costa over to a group of men. One was pointing at blueprints while gesturing at the building.</p><p>Several others were gathered around him, most in suits, one in Carhartts that were well-worn. To my surprise, the man who had been gesturing directions from the blueprints walked to meet us, after giving the large papers to one of the suits.</p><p>He nodded to Costa and then me. His eyes only passed over me for a moment, a quick flick of his gaze, but I felt suddenly like I\u2019d been weighed, measured, and cataloged.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Luc Chevalier. Thank you for agreeing to meet here, detectives,\u201d he said, as if we\u2019d had a choice in the matter. \u201cHow can I help the OWEA today?\u201d</p><p>A slightly better than average-looking man, he stood around five foot nine and had wavy brown hair and brown eyes. He was attractive, but not striking and I didn\u2019t feel the aura of fear coming from him that I usually sensed from vampires. We could have been standing outside with a regular construction foreman for all I could tell.</p><p>It was unsettling.</p> <p>\u201cThank you for meeting with us on such short notice, Magister,\u201d Costa said. \u201cI am Agent Costa. This is Detective Whitman from the Chicago PD\u2019s paranormal unit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you both.\u201d</p><p>A strong breeze whipped my hair around my face, and a whiff of Costa\u2019s aftershave touched my nose. I fought not to step closer to him. A man should not be allowed to smell so good.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here to talk to you about one of your companies.\u201d Costa flipped open a small notebook and glanced at the first page. \u201cNMR Real Estate, to be precise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not normally involved in the day-to-day operations of my companies, you understand. I am more of a high-level manager, but I will of course help you if I can.\u201d Chevalier\u2019s French accent coated his words, making the English sound more musical.</p><p>\u201cDo you recall an incident in St. Louis, nearly a year ago now, where a kidnapped woman was held in one of your company\u2019s warehouses?\u201d</p><p>Luc glanced at me. \u201cYes, the succubus. I remember.</p><p>I never spoke with the police about it. My son, Nicolas, oversees my holdings in St. Louis. He handled the situation.\u201d</p> <p>I frowned. I\u2019d never met Nicolas Chevalier but Mac said something was off about him, and that he was quick to anger.</p><p>\u201cIs Nicolas available?\u201d I asked. \u201cIt would be helpful to speak with him, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid not. He left last night for Europe. He won\u2019t be returning for a few weeks.\u201d Luc offered me an apologetic smile.</p><p>\u201cIt would really help us out\u2014\u201d I began.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but it\u2019s impossible. He\u2019s there for important business negotiations and will not return until everything is settled. You\u2019ll have to discuss this with me.\u201d</p><p>Pressure built in my chest and I wanted to shriek and rage so badly\u2014tell him exactly how important I found his business negotiations compared to my sister\u2019s life\u2014that I had to close my eyes for a moment to get a grip. I filled my lungs with a deep breath of air and tried to push the thoughts riding on the tip of my tongue to the back of my throat.</p><p>\u201cWell, then you are aware that someone at your company rented out a warehouse\u2014with no paper trail\u2014 to an individual who used the building to keep at least one woman prisoner. An individual who then tried to ship her out of the country?\u201d Costa asked, giving me time to compose myself.</p><p>I opened my eyes to see that Luc\u2019s attention had shifted from me to Costa, and some of my embarrassment faded, lifting a small weight from my chest.</p><p>\u201cYes. We had a manager trying to make some money on the side. He\u2019s been eliminated\u2014from his position\u2014for his actions.\u201d</p><p>I opened my mouth to ask for more details, but Costa shot me a warning glance.</p><p>\u201cWe believe that something similar may be happening in Chicago as we speak,\u201d Costa said. \u201cWe can\u2019t say for sure that this person is using one of your buildings again, but it is possible, considering how much property you own through companies in the area,\u201d Costa said.</p><p>\u201cI find that unlikely, but you can trust that I will review my records and let you know if I see any rentals that are out of the ordinary,\u201d Luc said.</p><p>\u201cIt would be better if we could go over those records ourselves.\u201d Costa smiled, and the expression was somehow predatory.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so, Agent.\u201d Luc\u2019s smile was just as wolfish.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the manager who rented the unit in St.</p><p>Louis? You said he was fired, but maybe you know how to find him,\u201d Costa shot back.</p><p>\u201cHe seems to have disappeared.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, of course he had. I didn\u2019t particularly care about the Magister\u2019s staff or how he handled his business. Right now, all I cared about was finding Elaine.</p><p>\u201cLook.\u201d I swallowed hard as both men broke eye contact to look at me. \u201cI understand why you wouldn\u2019t want us in your records, Magister. And really, I don\u2019t see this twisted son of a bitch going through the regular channels like that anyway. What would be more helpful is a list of the properties that you show as currently vacant that meet our guidelines.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not just going to hand over\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis asshole has my sister, Magister.\u201d I stared down at my hands and suppressed the urge to rub my temples.</p><p>I had to convince him. For Elaine. My pride didn\u2019t mean jack right now. \u201cI know that this isn\u2019t something you\u2019d normally allow, but I have to find her. Please. She\u2019s been through enough.\u201d</p><p>He rocked back onto his heels and crossed his arms, a thoughtful expression on his face. I met his gaze, knowing how desperate I must look, but not caring. Elaine was more important than my pride.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said finally. \u201cBut only the buildings that fit your criteria.\u201d</p><p>Hope filled my chest, and I opened my mouth to thank him, but the Magister held up his hand.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t thank me, Detective. My people learned from the last incident. I don\u2019t think you will find her in one of my buildings.\u201d He gave me a small smile, and for a second the average man appeared almost human. \u201cBut I do hope you find your sister.\u201d</p><p>It took less than an hour for Luc Chevalier\u2019s office to send us a list of the warehouses that met our criteria.</p><p>Then another half hour back at the office for Costa and me to plot the thirty locations on Google Maps. Forty-five minutes to settle on which ones fit what we were looking for the best\u2014far enough away from populated buildings, in areas that were run-down and not highly populated.</p><p>Fifteen minutes to convince Vasquez to send a set of uniforms to check out a few of the warehouses for us.</p><p>The clock on the dashboard in Costa\u2019s rental read two by the time we headed out of the office. My stomach rumbled, but I ignored the sound. We\u2019d already wasted too much time getting on the road. Costa didn\u2019t mention lunch, either, and though annoyed, I was grateful for it.</p><p>\u201cSo we should be able to get through two or three pretty quickly,\u201d I said. \u201cThese three are all within a mile or so of each other. I hope Chevalier\u2019s man isn\u2019t late.\u201d</p><p>Chevalier had promised that one of his employees would meet us at the first location, and then travel to the other two to unlock them for us as well.</p><p>Costa grunted. I hadn\u2019t expected much more of a response. We\u2019d been through this already, at the station.</p><p>For some reason, saying it aloud made me feel better, calmer. I could deal with this so long as I had a plan.</p><p>\u201cSo your sister,\u201d Costa began.</p><p>I winced. \u201cI\u2019m not sure this is the best time to talk about her. I need to keep my focus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get that. I know she went through some stuff\u2014 you don\u2019t have to rehash that if you don\u2019t want to. It\u2019s just... Where are your parents?\u201d He glanced at me before returning his gaze to the road.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know who our dads are.\u201d</p><p>His eyes widened.</p><p>\u201cYes. We have different dads.\u201d I turned my head to face my window, and watched the gray buildings slip past us. \u201cMy mom enjoyed being a succubus. She wasn\u2019t exactly the marrying kind.\u201d My voice faded at the end, and I clenched my teeth together. It shouldn\u2019t bother me. \u201cShe passed away when Elaine was still a teenager, a couple years before...\u201d I cleared my throat and willed the image of Elaine, so broken and damaged after her attack, from my mind. \u201cAnyway, it\u2019s just been us ever since. I mean, we have some extended family, a couple of aunts. But they don\u2019t live around here, so we don\u2019t see them that often.\u201d</p><p>My voice broke, and I blinked back tears. \u201cElaine is all I have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I said, I read her file. You don\u2019t have to talk about it if you don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>But suddenly I did want to talk about it, and the words felt as if they would burst from my chest if I didn\u2019t get them out. \u201cShe was so damaged after the attack, I wasn\u2019t sure I\u2019d ever get her back.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHer date tried to rape her,\u201d he said, voice low.</p><p>\u201cYes, and she sucked the life out of him for it.\u201d I took a ragged breath. \u201cAnd he deserved it. He would have killed her.\u201d</p><p>Costa was silent for a few moments, as if considering the right thing to say. \u201cYou know that for sure?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes. The sharing that happens when a succubus drinks from her...well, normally her lover, it allows the couple to share emotions, thoughts, even memories.\u201d</p><p>Costa turned and I gripped the door, though he took the turn slowly. \u201cLater, when she was able to talk about it, she told me that she could see his plans for her body after he was done with her. Broken and ragged and dead at the bottom of a hole somewhere.\u201d</p><p>Costa was silent, and I wondered if I was only adding to his view that succubi were dangerous. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t deserve this,\u201d I whispered. \u201cShe\u2019d only just gotten herself back.\u201d</p><p>Costa touched my shoulder, his hand cool against my suddenly too hot skin. \u201cWe\u2019re going to find her, I promise.\u201d</p><p>The first warehouse on our list looked promising.</p> <p>It was in an industrial area on the south side of the city, and the exterior looked terrifying enough for a person to imagine a kidnapped girl being held there. Rust stains covered the old metal siding, and the neighborhood was quiet and dirty. Potholes pitted the asphalt that surrounded the building and the road leading to it. Bits of paper and cans traced the edges of the road.</p><p>I walked around the perimeter while we waited for the man with the key, conscious of Costa following in my wake. He moved quietly, which made me all the more aware of my heels knocking against the pavement.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to look into that connection, you know,\u201d</p><p>I told him after we\u2019d circled the building. None of the windows was low enough to peer into, and both doors had been disappointingly sturdy. \u201cBetween Astrid\u2019s murder and our kidnappings.\u201d</p><p>He was silent and still, like a snake about to strike. His dark eyes never strayed from mine.</p><p>\u201cSo if you have something you want to tell me, you should tell me now.\u201d</p> <p>Chapter Eight</p><p>Darkness crept from every corner of the warehouse, and the air hung heavily, filling my throat and lungs with moldy dampness. I coughed to clear my throat and stepped into the room, clicking on my flashlight. No power ran to the structure. It wasn\u2019t necessary since, according to Luc Chevalier, the building hadn\u2019t been used in nearly five years. And the warehouse was not available for rent because it needed to be cleaned and renovated\u2014 one among many properties on their list with that issue, apparently.</p><p>Costa\u2019s flashlight beamed from behind me, and I felt him move close\u2014too close. I almost wished that Chevalier\u2019s man had stayed with us instead of moving on to unlock the next warehouse. I took a step, then another, walking carefully to avoid the debris on the floor.</p><p>Bits and pieces of metal were interspersed on the ground in small, cobwebbed piles. They looked like brackets of some sort\u2014probably the last thing that was produced in this building. I moved my flashlight across the ground, revealing the large room foot by foot. The concrete floor was free of any equipment, and the warehouse looked like it was simply a big room devoid of anything to really hide behind, save some empty pallets stacked one to two feet high along the edges of the room.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see any doors leading to other rooms, do you?\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cLooks like an office in the back,\u201d he said, voice only slightly louder than mine.</p><p>I followed him to the far side of the building, and sure enough, in one corner, a door stood. The window built into the top part of the wood was so covered in dust and grime that I couldn\u2019t make out anything in the room beyond.</p><p>Costa moved from where he stood beside me to try the knob. It turned easily.</p> <p>The door drifted open and Costa pulled his gun from his belt, keeping it pointed at the ground.</p><p>\u201cPolice,\u201d he called, with a voice loud enough to carry through the whole warehouse.</p><p>Movement in the corner of the room, just on the edge of my flashlight\u2019s glow, made me jump. I pulled my gun as I hastily tried to follow the shape with the light. But I halted when I caught up to it.</p><p>\u201cDamn rat,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>We searched what seemed like every square inch of the dirty old warehouse, but there was no basement or rooms other than the office and a couple of restrooms.</p><p>Every inch felt emptier than the last and there was no sign that anyone had been in the building recently.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not here,\u201d I said, as Costa pointed his flashlight across the rafters in the ceiling.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d he asked, turning the flashlight to face the floor.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not okay,\u201d I muttered, and then winced, hoping my voice was too low for him to have heard.</p><p>Costa grabbed my hand and squeezed. \u201cIf it were my brother in this situation, I wouldn\u2019t be okay, either,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>\u201cYou have a brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I have a brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOlder or younger?\u201d Was it possible Costa understood more than I credited him for?</p><p>\u201cYounger,\u201d he said, voice rough. \u201cI am very protective of him, like you are of Elaine. I can\u2019t imagine how you\u2019re feeling right now. How you\u2019re keeping it together.\u201d</p><p>I grunted. \u201cI thought you\u2019d decided I was a cold bitch for handling it so well.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t see his face in the dark, but his hand dropped from mine. I fought not to reach for him, reach for the small bit of comfort that touch had given me, reach for the greater comfort I knew he could give me. If he wanted to.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just go,\u201d I said finally, the darkness and silence eating at me. \u201cI\u2019m fine. It was a long shot that we\u2019d find her here. Let\u2019s go to the next one.\u201d I headed for the door, leaving Costa to follow me out, and tried to shove thoughts of Elaine trapped in a similar building\u2014filled with dirt and rats and sharp pieces of metal\u2014from my mind.</p><p>After searching through all three warehouses we\u2019d pegged for the day, I had come to the conclusion that looking for a succubus in a warehouse was akin to looking for a needle in a haystack. And that Luc Chevalier was a bit of a slumlord. We\u2019d found exactly nothing. Zip. Nada. And neither had the other team Vasquez sent to check out a couple of other warehouses across town.</p><p>My stomach rumbled as Costa pulled up to the restaurant where I\u2019d parked my car that morning.</p><p>\u201cYou want to go in and get a bite to eat?\u201d Costa asked.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I said. There were worse things to look at while I ate than Valerio Costa, that was for sure.</p><p>We walked into the restaurant and waited again for a table. A host manned the station today, a skinny young guy, who looked like he needed to grow into his long arms and legs\u2014probably a college kid. I looked at Costa and frowned as I took in his expression. Anger creased his face into a glare. A look that he directed at the host.</p><p>I glanced at the man, but he didn\u2019t seem to notice Costa\u2019s attention. His eyes were solely focused on me, and I suppressed a sigh at the blatant look of hunger. I touched Costa\u2019s shoulder and he tore his gaze from the young man and blinked at me for a couple of seconds before his expression cleared to his normal professional visage.</p><p>I didn\u2019t really notice the looks men gave me anymore, not unless they were terribly dramatic in their attention.</p><p>But obviously Costa wasn\u2019t entirely comfortable with the stares.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d Costa asked as we sat down at a table rather than the comfy booth we\u2019d had earlier in the day.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m as fine as I\u2019m going to be until we find Elaine. I wish you\u2019d quit asking me that.\u201d I flipped open the menu and my eyes glazed over reading it. Everything looked good when I was hungry.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he muttered. \u201cYou just seem...\u201d</p><p>I looked at him over my menu.</p><p>A hint of a smile broke out on his face. \u201cOkay, honestly, you look good\u2014you always do. But you also look a little tired.\u201d</p><p>I ignored the heat traveling up my neck. \u201cDamn right, I look good.\u201d I ignored his small prod about my lack of sleep. Of course I wasn\u2019t sleeping.</p><p>The waitress, a woman in her midforties who looked like she could do her job in her sleep, stopped by the table and looked at us expectantly. \u201cWhat can I getcha?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCoke. Cheeseburger and fries, please. No pickles.</p><p>Extra mustard,\u201d Costa said.</p><p>I trailed my eyes down the menu as she waited. Finally I said, \u201cFish sticks. Asparagus for the side. Oh, and hot tea, please.\u201d</p><p>The waitress made a small noise at that, but took our menus and wandered off.</p><p>\u201cReally? Fish sticks and asparagus?\u201d he asked, examining me like he\u2019d never seen me before.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hungry. Everything looked good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you decided to order one thing from the kid\u2019s menu and one from the adult\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>I laughed. The sound broke from my throat before I even realized what I was doing and how inappropriate it was given my current situation. I broke off abruptly, thoughts of Elaine milling around my brain.</p><p>\u201cYou can still laugh, you know,\u201d Costa said. \u201cIt\u2019s not betraying her to not be in mourning every second of every day.\u201d He leaned back in his chair and crossed his arms.</p><p>\u201cBesides, you\u2019re beautiful when you laugh.\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cNot that you\u2019re not always\u2014beautiful, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, that doesn\u2019t exactly separate me from the crowd, now does it?\u201d I said, suddenly more angry than happy about his compliment.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a succubus,\u201d I said, keeping my voice down to avoid bringing in the whole darn restaurant into our conversation. \u201cBeauty is sort of a given. Allure, inspiring lust in the opposite sex. It all comes with the package.\u201d</p><p>I took a deep breath, trying to think through how to say what I meant. \u201cI didn\u2019t earn any of it. It\u2019s just what I am.\u201d</p><p>His cop face returned, expressionless and cold. \u201cI suppose.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just\u2014it doesn\u2019t make me a better investigator.

When things got nearly too uncomfortable for me to stand, the waitress stopped by our table with our drinks and food.</p> <p>\u201cLook,\u201d I said, after she left. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t mean to be bitchy, and I know you were trying to be nice.\u201d</p><p>His eyes widened slightly. \u201cSure. Don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</p><p>We ate in silence. I scarfed down my asparagus and fish sticks at an alarming rate, and his burger disappeared quickly as well.</p><p>I briefly contemplated trying to convince Costa to check more warehouses with me, but the darkness seeping in the windows stopped me.</p><p>Costa pushed his plate away and took a long drink.</p> <p>\u201cYou should go home and get some rest.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, giving him a small smile. I agreed with him, I should go home and get some rest. But I wasn\u2019t going to.</p><p>And considering the hard time I\u2019d been giving him lately about honesty, it was best not to lie.</p><p>The station wasn\u2019t silent or unmanned, but the paranormal division\u2019s section was as close to empty as it ever got. Two detectives sat at their desks, their frowning faces turned toward their computers. A couple of uniforms filled out reports, looking like they\u2019d rather be anywhere else.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t any happier to be at the station at night. I should have been safely at home, sitting in front of the late-edition news while Elaine grumbled about her homework or gossiped with a new friend on the phone.</p><p>But that wasn\u2019t happening, and the station offered more access to data systems than my laptop would allow from my house, so I was stuck.</p> <p>I docked my laptop and waited for it to boot up, tapping my pink fingernails on the desk while it loaded. I pondered the coffee congealing in the corner coffeemaker but decided against it. Gross after-hours coffee was more likely to give me a stomachache than wake me up.</p><p>I logged into the Illinois State Police Criminal Records Database first. There were several entries for cases that involved fire, but none of the descriptions seemed to match what I was looking for. They\u2019d involved accelerants, and none seemed to have been burned so quickly to such a degree.</p><p>The fact that Costa was a salamander threw me, but he\u2019d told me straight out and that garnered him some trust. I didn\u2019t consider him a suspect\u2014well, not really. Oh, his job let him travel a lot, but unless his partner and boss were in on it, he\u2019d hardly have time to set up a succubi smuggling ring in his spare time. Plus, he was an OWEA agent. Lieutenant Vasquez took no chances after Mac\u2019s last major case. She\u2019d thought her partner-in-crime was an OWEA agent, and while he turned out to be one, for a while there it looked like he wasn\u2019t. Besides, Vasquez had checked his alibi. And Vasquez didn\u2019t do anything halfway.</p><p>I shot a quick glance at the lieutenant\u2019s office, but it was dark. Vasquez didn\u2019t like questions like that coming up about his department, so rules had been instituted after that case. No working with other agencies without running it by him, and all personnel were checked prior to giving out any information.</p><p>Besides, salamanders were relatively common\u2014not everywhere you looked, but I\u2019d bet I could find a couple on the Freak Squad roster.</p><p>A uniform who looked vaguely familiar walked up to the desk. Clark, that was it. He\u2019d asked me out once, not long after he graduated from the academy. An otherworlder, but I couldn\u2019t remember what kind.</p><p>\u201cHey, Marisol,\u201d he said. \u201cJust wanted to say that I was sorry to hear about you sister.\u201d</p><p>Tears pressed against my eyelids, and I squeezed them shut, giving Clark my back. \u201cThanks, Clark,\u201d I said, voice rough.</p> <p>\u201cLet me know if I can help somehow.\u201d He ignored my rudeness.</p><p>\u201cSure, thanks.\u201d</p><p>Clark was a nice guy. Too young for me and despite his nice form, he didn\u2019t do anything for me. But reaching out to me was kind. I shifted my focus from the young officer back to what I was doing. The federal database would take longer to load. I decided to start with the system pertaining to otherworlders only first. The data set was smaller. I couldn\u2019t imagine how many hits of burned bodies I would get from the full records.</p><p>Time ticked away on the clock above the coffeemaker as I waited for the information to load. The fed\u2019s database was always so damn slow. I tried to think through the case as I sat there, but it was difficult to focus. Instead I pulled out a legal pad and started to write down what I knew in short notes. Writing things out always made it easier for me to concentrate and make connections.</p><p>During the last two years, a lot of succubi had disappeared all over the country, from Anchorage to Phoenix and now Chicago. I thought about that, and then wrote, \u201cKidnapper must travel regularly\u201d next to my notes.</p><p>The kidnappers were selling the succubi to the highest bidders, no doubt accumulating a lot of cash. Would they travel in style? Probably. I made a note. What else?</p><p>I tapped the pen on the counter and then wrote, \u201cConnected to vampires?\u201d Chances were that the local Magister, Luc Chevalier, had been telling the truth. That he had no idea who rented the space from him previously.</p><p>But it was possible he\u2019d lied.</p><p>The information screen from the database popped up on the computer. Twelve otherworlder-related listings that matched my search parameters of occurring within the last two years and no use of accelerant. Seven of the listings were victims of house fires. That didn\u2019t mean they weren\u2019t related, but it was less likely. That left me five to check. Not bad.</p><p>The primary suspect in the first case was a woman\u2019s husband. An amateur witch, he had a very high amount of power in only one element\u2014fire. He would fit, but he was in jail, waiting to be tried for his wife\u2019s murder. The case was active, since it wouldn\u2019t be closed until the trial was officially completed.</p><p>The next six cases were unsolved; all involved the same M.O. as Astrid\u2019s. They were all either otherworlders or killed by an otherworlder\u2014though most, like Astrid\u2019s vic, could not be identified beyond that. Only two of the victims had actually been identified. One because enough material was left for a DNA analysis. A psychometrist had identified the other.</p><p>I clicked further into the psychometrist case first. It was probably just a coincidence. I had no real reason to think that it might be Costa\u2019s partner, but I still allowed myself a deep breath when the psychometrist was identified as a man. He worked for the Phoenix Police Department.</p><p>The victim proved to be an otherworlder. She\u2019d been killed only three months ago, and had been gone for nearly a month before her ashes turned up. The remains hadn\u2019t been found in an alley like Astrid\u2019s victim, instead they\u2019d been discovered in a vacant lot. A vacant lot right next to a suburban police department not far from Phoenix. The woman was identified as Lorna Thompson, and she\u2019d been a siren.</p><p>The other body that showed as ID\u2019d was found in Anchorage. There had been just enough DNA left to identify her as Mary Joyce. A twenty-two-year-old siren.</p><p>I held my breath at that. Both women were sirens.</p><p>Not succubi. Could there still be a connection? The cities matched. The date ranges weren\u2019t exact, but they were close.</p><p>Maybe...just, maybe.</p><p>I printed out a few summary pages of information on all seven cases that weren\u2019t tied to house fires and then typed in another search, this time for missing succubi women. The ticker slowly filled and I finally broke down and poured myself a cup of the old coffee. It had cooled, so after thirty seconds in the microwave, the gloop was ready to go. The thick liquid slid down my throat, seeming to coat my flesh as it passed.</p><p>By the time I got back to my computer, I wasn\u2019t any perkier, but it felt like a rock had settled into my stomach.</p><p>The search was complete, and I sat down to go through the twenty-two results.</p><p>Disheveled was a word that I never thought I\u2019d have the opportunity to use for Valerio Costa. But disheveled was exactly how he looked when I knocked on his hotel room door at one o\u2019clock in the morning. He hadn\u2019t shaved before he went to bed and rough darkness formed a shadow on his face. His ruffled hair stood up in odd places, and he peered at me from behind hooded eyes.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d he asked as he swung the door open.</p><p>I swallowed and tried to keep my eyes on his face. But I failed, and my gaze slid down his bare chest and boxer briefs to the long legs below, and then back up. I licked my lips. Why had I come here again?</p><p>\u201cI think that I\u2019ve found something,\u201d I said, not bothering to hide my interest in his physique. The man had a nice body under his clothes.</p><p>Costa raised an eyebrow at my frank look but didn\u2019t comment. Instead, he dressed in a T-shirt and a pair of basketball shorts. \u201cOkay, what is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo the succubi have been kidnapped and changed.</p><p>Have you given any thought to how long he had to...</p><p>experiment to get that change right? What did he do with the ones he wasn\u2019t able to successfully change?\u201d</p><p>Costa shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I always assumed that he held whoever the first one was long enough to get it right. Poor girl, whoever she was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould be,\u201d I said. \u201cBut maybe not.\u201d I waved the file folders I\u2019d filled with my copies of the burn victims and missing succubi case summaries at him. \u201cMaybe, like with any type of experiment\u2014scientific or magical\u2014they had several trial and errors first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. But we didn\u2019t find any bodies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d I strode past him into the room and tossed my purse and folder onto his bed, and then opened the folder, handing him pages as I spoke. \u201cThree years ago, a twenty-one-year-old succubus disappears in Seattle. She\u2019s never found. But two months after her disappearance a pile of ash is discovered near a Dumpster where homeless people like to hang out. No one would have suspected anything about it, but the ash wasn\u2019t burned well enough and some bones remained.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His brow furrowed and he scanned the pages as I handed them off. \u201cI didn\u2019t find anything about this in my research.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because the ashes weren\u2019t identified as a succubus. They were too far gone for DNA, and the sensitive they had examine them could only tell that they were otherworlder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t prove anything\u2014\u201d</p> <p>I gave him the next sheet of paper. \u201cTwo and a half years ago, New York City. A succubus disappears, headed to a casting call that a friend told her about. She was nineteen years old. Three months later, ashes were found\u2014these placed ridiculously close to a police station.</p><p>Again, the ashes were too far gone to be identified as the succubus, but otherworlder energies were found on the body.\u201d I shook my head. \u201cIt\u2019s the placement of this one and several of the others that bothers me. They were all placed in spots where the person or people burning them were likely to get caught, or where the ashes were likely to be noticed as odd. Even the one here in Chicago was behind one of the nicest hotels in the city, situated by a bakery and a club so almost all hours of the day it was likely to be noticed. It\u2019s like the guy wanted to be caught.\u201d</p><p>Costa snorted. \u201cMore likely he\u2019s just trying to show how damned smart he is by taunting the police and committing the crimes under their noses.\u201d</p><p>My eyes widened. \u201cSo you think the idea has merit?\u201d</p><p>He grinned at me. \u201cI think this is some of the finest damned police work I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d</p> <p>I shouldn\u2019t have glowed at his compliment, but I couldn\u2019t help the heat that flushed my face, or the rush of pride that filled me. I knew I was a good cop, but it felt pretty darn nice to hear someone else say it for a change.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I said, flashing him a real smile.</p><p>He reached out and took my hand, and electricity jumped from him to me. Suddenly the room was too hot, and I took an involuntary step toward him.</p><p>His dark eyes met mine. Heat and desire rolled there, so intense that my breath quickened.</p><p>My smile faltered and he closed the gap between us.</p><p>His scent washed over me\u2014soap and toothpaste, and an underlying smell of him\u2014and he lowered his face to mine.</p> <p>He took my mouth softly, his lips cool against my hot skin. Desire rushed through me and I couldn\u2019t hear anything, couldn\u2019t see anything, couldn\u2019t sense anything but him. I wrapped my arms around his neck, pulling him closer. He slid his tongue between my lips, and I moaned.</p><p>Ringing brought me back to myself. Ringing and Costa, stepping back, pulling my arms from around his neck. Ringing, and the flash of thoughts of Elaine.</p><p>Blood rushed to my ears. I\u2019d come here to show him what a good cop I was. To prove, for once, that I was more than sex in heels. That I was more than my succubus heritage.</p><p>And I\u2019d ruined it.</p><p>I grabbed my jacket and purse off his bed and glanced at the files. No, I didn\u2019t need them. I had copies in my car.</p><p>\u201cWait a sec\u2014\u201d Costa said to me, phone firmly attached to his ear.</p><p>\u201cSorry, it\u2019s late. I have to go,\u201d I said without looking at him. Then I turned and took my sorry ass home.</p><p>Chapter Nine</p> <p>My embarrassment the next day was only made worse by the fact that Costa didn\u2019t call and try to talk to me. Not surprising, really, since I\u2019d stormed out like a shamed teenager who\u2019d never kissed a boy before. That he didn\u2019t call me in the morning either didn\u2019t help. I knew that I should act like an adult and call him, but I couldn\u2019t. So I steeled myself and went in to the station without him. I was fully intent on ignoring what had happened between us and focusing on finding Elaine.</p><p>Then I saw him.</p><p>Costa stood next to the coffee pot with Lieutenant Vasquez, and they spoke in low tones. With his normal serious expression plastered on his face, Costa didn\u2019t look concerned at all. He appeared well rested and confident.</p><p>Handsome and cool. Not at all ruffled by our kiss.</p><p>Fine. Two could play at that game.</p><p>I gave Costa a cool nod, and then headed to Astrid\u2019s desk.</p><p>Astrid looked up at my approach and smiled at me.</p><p>\u201cHi, Marisol. How goes it?\u201d</p><p>I filled her in on my theory, in low tones not so hushed as to draw attention, and her brows drew together when I finished.</p><p>\u201cThat all tracks. In fact\u2014\u201d She opened a file drawer and grabbed a folder out of it, then flipped it open. \u201cWe just got a report in from Denver about burned remains found there. I doubt it would have been in the database yet. It\u2019s not new, but they just figured out the oh-dub connection.\u201d I shook my head and she nodded. \u201cThis one is also likely an otherworlder, found in an odd spot, right outside of the doors of a twenty-four-hour Target.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSecurity cameras?\u201d I asked.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cMissing. Quite mysteriously, of course.\u201d</p><p>I stilled, mind going into overdrive. Camera footage going missing. That sounded too familiar to be a coincidence. No way were these people just sneaking in to steal the camera footage from all these places\u2014someone would have seen something. They could only get lucky so many times. Were they buying the footage? Paying off people on the inside?</p><p>\u201cBut we did luck out,\u201d Astrid continued. She shut the file folder and met my gaze. \u201cThe killer\u2014or killers\u2014 screwed up.\u201d</p><p>I sat down across from her and leaned toward her, reaching for the file folder. \u201cWhat did we get?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA couple of spots of blood were found only a few feet away from the ashes, and they were untouched by the fire. We think it\u2019s our vic, and it sounds like it matches the M.O. you\u2019re looking for. But we\u2019re waiting on lab results.\u201d</p><p>I scanned the file as she spoke. \u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>When Astrid didn\u2019t continue I looked up from the folder, but her attention was focused above my shoulder.</p><p>Great. I looked behind me and up into Costa\u2019s grim expression.</p><p>\u201cKeep going, Astrid,\u201d I said, and turned my attention back to the folder.</p><p>\u201cThe woman disappeared around three weeks before the ashes were found. She was young\u2014twenty-one. And she was a siren.\u201d Astrid\u2019s expression went blank and her eyes unfocused, staring at the wall behind me.</p><p>\u201cAstrid?\u201d The young woman didn\u2019t move at the sound of my voice. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d I waved my hand across the space her gaze was locked on, and she took in a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d she whispered, then shooting a quick glance at Costa, she said to me, \u201cI\u2019m headed to the lab, if you want to come.\u201d</p><p>Should I go to the lab? The large presence at my back reminded me of the benefits of accompanying her. I could avoid Costa for a while. Give myself a chance to overcome my embarrassment.</p><p>No, you put on your big girl pants today, remember?</p><p>No hiding out. You\u2019re an adult.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay, but thanks. I have some other stuff I want to follow up on. But let me know what you find out, okay? I\u2019ll do the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she said, but the tension in her shoulders didn\u2019t dissipate.</p><p>\u201cGive us a second, Costa,\u201d I said, keeping my eyes on Astrid.</p><p>I could feel him walk away, though he made no noise.</p><p>I shot a glance over my shoulder. He was back across the room, standing safely next to the coffee pot. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d I asked her.</p><p>She stood and walked around the desk, then leaned in so her mouth was only inches from my ear, and whispered, \u201cHe feels like fire. Salamander?\u201d</p><p>I grinned at her. \u201cApparently quite the wannabe pyro.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going, exactly?\u201d Costa asked as he shut the passenger door of my car.</p><p>I turned the key and my little Honda purred to life.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to talk to Natalie, our local contact with the Covenant witches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and Astrid spoke with her earlier this week, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but she wasn\u2019t terribly helpful.\u201d I hit the gas and brought us into traffic. Natalie\u2019s wasn\u2019t far from the station.</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think she\u2019ll be more helpful now?\u201d</p><p>He braced himself against the doorframe as I made a quick turn.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to be more persuasive. Besides, we have more info to go on. Maybe.\u201d</p><p>Natalie Leigh waited for us in her office\u2014alone this time. Her professional demeanor was in full force\u2014polite smile, accommodating attitude. Until I told her why we were there.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t give you access to our records, Detective Whitman. Even only the ones for witches who travel a lot and...\u201d She glanced down at the note she\u2019d jotted when I\u2019d started explaining what we were looking for. \u201c...who would have the ability to burn a body to a crisp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, then,\u201d I said. \u201cGive me some of your expertise.\u201d</p><p>Natalie leaned back in her chair and gestured for me to continue.</p><p>\u201cYou told me that the only creatures that could burn a body without accelerant and within such a short timeframe to the degree we\u2019re seeing are salamanders, a powerful witch\u2014or a group of witches\u2014a firebird, or a shaman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, to my knowledge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what type of creature could twist a succubus\u2019s power to make it work in reverse?\u201d I asked. Costa stiffened beside me. I probably wasn\u2019t supposed to hand out that case information willy-nilly, but Natalie was a good person, and she worked on plenty of secretive police cases. If I could get her to take me seriously, she might help us.</p><p>Natalie\u2019s mouth dropped open. \u201cThat\u2019s not\u2014I mean, such a thing isn\u2019t possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been done. To at least one succubus, and we suspect to several others.\u201d I swallowed hard. \u201cAnd we think that it\u2019s being done to my sister right now. In this very city somewhere.\u201d</p><p>She glanced at Costa, who nodded.</p><p>I leaned toward her. \u201cWe need your help.\u201d</p><p>Natalie took a deep breath and then nodded. \u201cDoing such a thing is an abomination. It\u2019s a perversion.\u201d She paused, looking lost in thought. \u201cAnd such a thing could only be accomplished by a powerful witch. Knowledgeable, too. A Covenant witch.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe think it might be an excommunicated witch,\u201d</p><p>Costa said.</p><p>Relief flooded her face. \u201cOf course. Such a thing is possible.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWill you help us get the information we need?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do what I can,\u201d she said, then quickly added, \u201cbut you have to keep this between us. I could lose my position for helping you without being authorized first.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cHow long would authorization take?\u201d</p><p>She laughed, a light musical sound. \u201cSomewhere between forever and never. There\u2019s no way the Covenant will authorize me to share this kind of information with the police. There\u2019s always the small chance that it\u2019ll be a Covenant member and they\u2019d never willingly let anything like that come out publicly.\u201d</p><p>She was taking a big risk for us, but I couldn\u2019t for the life of me ask her not to. This was too important. Elaine\u2019s life was on the line. \u201cHow big of a list do you think it would be?\u201d</p> <p>Her forehead scrunched up as she thought about my question. \u201cExcommunicated members? There are very few\u2014even fewer who could pull something like this off.</p><p>I\u2019d guess less than five. Maybe only one or two that I can think of off the top of my head. I\u2019ll have to do some research.\u201d She took a deep breath and let it out in a rush.</p><p>\u201cNow current Covenant members...probably a dozen or two on the continent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould a group of witches pull this off?\u201d I didn\u2019t want to expand our potentials list, but I had to make sure we didn\u2019t miss the real perp just because we concentrated on the easy-to-track suspects.</p><p>\u201cMaybe. But you\u2019d still need to have a strong witch leading them. And he or she would need to have a lot of Covenant knowledge.\u201d She chewed on the inside of her lip. \u201cNo. I think we should start with the potentials we already discussed. This kind of scheme, it doesn\u2019t seem like something a group of mediocre witches\u2014even with a well-educated one in the group\u2014could pull off. The burnings, yes, without a doubt. But the power-twisting... no. I just don\u2019t see it.\u201d</p><p>I hated to ask it\u2014the man was ridiculously powerful\u2014 but I had to. \u201cCouncilor Koslov. When did he get into town?\u201d</p> <p>She considered it for a moment. \u201cYes, I\u2019ll admit the timing fits, but the talent doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I sat down in one of the chairs across from Natalie, conscious of Costa at my back.</p><p>\u201cI mean Viktor could probably do it, given enough time and a good stash of ingredients, but it\u2019s unlikely. Most witches, Covenant especially, have a strength in one or two elements. They tend to nurture those powers, sometimes completely ignoring the rest. Viktor isn\u2019t a true slouch in any element\u2014he couldn\u2019t be, as a council member. But his strength is in water. He couldn\u2019t pull off that sort of burning easily even if he wanted to.\u201d She tapped her index finger against her lips.</p><p>\u201cHow much time would he need?\u201d</p><p>She frowned and dropped her hand to her lap. \u201cDays, probably.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen do you think you\u2019ll have a list for us?\u201d Costa asked, and my chair back flexed under his grip, his long fingers only inches from my back.</p><p>Natalie grimaced. \u201cA day or two. I\u2019ll have to reach out to some sources\u2014discreetly. This isn\u2019t the kind of information we keep in a database somewhere.\u201d</p><p>My heart dropped, but I nodded and pushed up from my chair. I held out my hand and Natalie shook it. Costa walked to the office door and held it open for me.</p> <p>\u201cThank you so much for your help. Finding my sister before her power is\u2014\u201d My voice cracked and Natalie nodded.</p><p>\u201cI understand. I\u2019ll be in touch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we should go talk to the head of campus security again,\u201d I said when we reached my car, which was parked a good distance from Natalie\u2019s building. My refusal to pay for more than street parking had lost me many a calorie.</p><p>Besides, it didn\u2019t seem fair to ask her to validate a parking ticket on top of risking her career to help us.</p><p>I half expected Costa to argue, or to ask if I had other reasons for wanting to talk to the man again, but he didn\u2019t.</p><p>Instead he nodded and said, \u201cGood idea. Something about him was off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. He was sweating in a cold room. And these guys, whoever they are, have a history of paying people off to get what they want. The warehouse in St. Louis where the succubus was held that you rescued? They paid a low- level vamp to rent that under the table. And the video footage that disappeared from the Target store where some of the burned remains were found, that was likely a payoff, too.\u201d I turned the car on and pulled into traffic.</p><p>\u201cTrue. It would be a helluva lot easier to pay someone off to delete the footage and destroy any backups than to do some magical mumbo jumbo to get rid of it.\u201d As I made a turn, Costa\u2019s hand flew up to grip the ceiling and I grinned.</p><p>\u201cIs it just my driving that bothers you, or other drivers in general?\u201d</p><p>He glanced at me before his eyes moved back to the road.</p><p>I snickered and made another turn. \u201cSo, if someone is paying to have things made easier, and to make things disappear, it only stands to reason that they paid to have the video footage disappear from the library, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut they could have paid off someone in security,\u201d</p><p>Costa pointed out.</p><p>\u201cTrue. But the security guy seemed nervous.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and we rode in silence for the next few minutes.</p><p>\u201cAbout last night\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t need to talk about last night,\u201d I snapped, and then made a right turn, harder than I strictly needed to.</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t want you to think that\u2019s something I do normally.\u201d He glanced at me, and something in my expression made him frown. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think it\u2019s something you do, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a succubus, remember? I thought you\u2019d already decided I feed my tastes wherever and whenever I please,\u201d</p><p>I said bitterly.</p><p>\u201cI made some assumptions about you\u2014hell, Marisol, I\u2019m sorry for that. But I have my reasons. I already apologized. Are you going to punish me for it for the rest of the damned case?\u201d</p><p>I chewed on the inside of my lip, searching for the right response. There didn\u2019t seem to be one. \u201cI\u2019m not punishing you. I just think that we both know that kissing was a bad idea. Let\u2019s just drop it, okay?\u201d I made a hard left, but Costa\u2019s tight grip on the dash had lost its humor for me.</p><p>\u201cWhatever you say.\u201d He turned to look out his window.</p><p>We drove in silence the last few minutes to Natalie\u2019s.</p><p>When I parked, I could almost see the tension melt from Costa\u2019s body, and I frowned.</p><p>I was a perfectly good driver.</p><p>We walked to the security office, and I glanced at the clock above the front desk. It read two. I grimaced.</p><p>No lunch. Again. As if signaled, my stomach twisted in annoyance.</p><p>We walked down the hall, and I found myself moving lightly, with Costa far more reserved at my back. The idea of nailing the security guy to the wall\u2014for helping someone kidnap my sister, no less\u2014filled me with delight.</p><p>I rapped on the glazed glass on the head of security\u2019s door, and then opened it without waiting for a response.</p><p>The man sat behind his big desk, an angry scowl on his face for our rude entrance. He looked up and met my smile, and his expression lightened. Then he saw Costa behind me, and something like fear danced across his face before the scowl returned.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry but I can\u2019t help you people right now. I have shift schedules for the next month that I have to finish.</p><p>You\u2019ll need to schedule an appointment and come back.\u201d</p><p>Costa shut the door behind us, and the door clanked loudly as it hit. Donovan started at the noise.</p><p>The squirrely man\u2019s face suddenly enraged me, and the bit of excitement I\u2019d felt at having a lead in Elaine\u2019s disappearance was swept away. \u201cWhere is my sister, you son of a bitch?\u201d</p><p>His mouth dropped open. I strode around the desk, grabbed the front of his shirt, and shook him. \u201cWhere is she?\u201d What right did he have to walk free while she was being held somewhere, scared and maybe hurt? My blood boiled, and I yelled questions at him faster than he could answer.</p><p>Hard hands gripped my shoulders and yanked me off the weasel. I fought them, until Costa turned me around to face him. \u201cYou wait over there,\u201d he said quietly, and nodded to the door.</p><p>Numbness replaced the anger, and I pulled free of Costa\u2019s grip and walked around the desk, back stiff. My professional facade had failed me. Tears burned my eyes and throat.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here to talk about the money, Donovan.\u201d</p><p>Costa\u2019s voice was hard.</p><p>I kept my face as emotionless as I could. We didn\u2019t have a money trail on Donovan, but he didn\u2019t know that.</p><p>Donovan shifted in his seat. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about, but you\u2019re going to have to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe money they paid you to get rid of the security footage. The money they paid you to lie to us. The money they paid you to help them kidnap a young woman,\u201d Costa said, ignoring Donovan\u2019s splutters. \u201cYou are going to tell us everything you know right now. Or you and I are going to go somewhere more private to talk.\u201d Costa leaned over the man.</p><p>Donovan cringed as his gaze met Costa\u2019s. And suddenly he pushed back, trying to scoot his chair away while never taking his eyes off the OWEA agent. \u201cNo\u2014 you can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>Costa slapped his palm onto Donovan\u2019s desk. \u201cTell us about the money!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine!\u201d Donovan screeched. \u201cFine, I\u2019ll tell you!\u201d</p><p>Costa stood straight and crossed his arms.</p><p>\u201cA big guy came in and threatened me if I didn\u2019t help him. And...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d Costa said.</p><p>\u201cHe offered me the money, too. But that\u2019s not why I did it. He was a scary guy.\u201d His eyes darted to me, but he didn\u2019t change his story. Apparently impressing me was slightly less important than not pissing off Costa. \u201cI was worried for my life; you have to believe me!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Costa grabbed him by the front of his shirt and yanked him up from the chair. Donovan cringed, all the wrinkles of his face suddenly visible and deeply etched, and sweat trailed down his neck to pool at Costa\u2019s hand. Costa\u2019s grip held firm, and what Donovan saw in Costa\u2019s eyes made him shake.</p><p>\u201cStop your sniveling.\u201d He tossed the man back down onto the chair.</p><p>\u201cWhat did this man look like?\u201d I asked.</p> <p>Donovan shrugged. \u201cBig guy. He wore sunglasses and a hat so I didn\u2019t get that good of a look. He had tattoos on his arms\u2014they were covered with them.\u201d</p><p>I crossed my arms and gripped my elbows, trying to focus on the conversation. A sleeve of tattoos. Just like the psychometrist had seen in her vision of Wendy\u2019s death.</p><p>There were so many questions I wanted to ask, but I couldn\u2019t move, couldn\u2019t speak. I shook with the force of my feelings. I knew that all it would take was one slip, and I\u2019d be across that table, trying to strangle the evil little man. I tried to breathe, closing my eyes against the feeling.</p><p>When I opened them, Costa stood in front of me, sunglasses back on. He was shoving his cell phone into his jacket pocket. But for the life of me I couldn\u2019t remember him making a call, let alone what he\u2019d said.</p><p>\u201cCome on. I\u2019ve got a couple of uniforms coming to take him in. We\u2019ll get an artist on the drawing tonight. By tomorrow, we should have a good idea of what this guy looks like.\u201d He lowered his voice and touched my upper arm. \u201cBetween that and the list from Natalie, we\u2019ll find this guy. I promise.\u201d</p> <p>I nodded woodenly, wishing I could be so certain.</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>Costa took over the driving after the officers arrived to take Donovan to the station. He turned the radio on and we listened to golden oldies and hit the McDonald\u2019s drive- thru. When asked, I told him I wanted chicken nuggets and iced tea.</p><p>I blinked dumbly for a few seconds when I looked up to see us parked in front of his hotel.</p><p>\u201cI thought we were going back to the station.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured you could use a drink. It\u2019s only six o\u2019clock.</p> <p>Some food and a few drinks and we can talk about the case.\u201d</p><p>He was right. And what would I do at home anyway?</p><p>Sit there and feel sorry for myself, that\u2019s what. Sleep didn\u2019t seem to be a valid option for me anymore, and I would think better with someone to bounce ideas off of. \u201cI don\u2019t really drink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you can watch me, then.\u201d</p><p>I followed Costa to his room, carrying the drinks while he carried the food. His room didn\u2019t have a table, but it had a small desk. I sat there and ate my nuggets, while Costa ate his hamburger on the edge of the bed. True to his word, Costa had beer and some of the whiskey I\u2019d seen him drink before. I hated whiskey and liked beer even less, but to each their own. I\u2019d seen cops turn to much worse things than the occasional drink\u2014couldn\u2019t blame them with the things we saw on the job.</p><p>We ate mostly in silence, commenting occasionally about the news program on television. \u201cSo why do you think he\u2019s doing this?\u201d I asked Costa after we\u2019d finished eating.</p><p>Costa didn\u2019t ask who I meant. Instead he clicked off the television and faced me. \u201cGreed, I guess. You\u2019ve been a cop for a while. You know what people will do for money.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cI get that. I mean, as much as I can. But if it was only about the money, then why move on to different otherworlders\u2014nonsuccubi?\u201d If my theory actually held water, that was.</p> <p>\u201cExpanding his product line.\u201d Costa sipped his beer and ignored the dirty look I shot him.</p><p>\u201cPeople aren\u2019t products,\u201d I said, finally.</p><p>He rubbed his face with his free hand. \u201cI\u2019m not saying they are. But to some people they might as well be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just\u2014\u201d I took a haggard breath and let it out slowly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m getting emotional today.</p><p>I feel like I\u2019m going to blow up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave a beer.\u201d He tossed me one and I groaned.</p><p>\u201cSeriously? Beer is nasty.\u201d I looked at the label and grimaced.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good beer. I won\u2019t have you insulting it in my house.\u201d He grinned at me and I chuckled at his stupid joke, some of the tension finally seeping out of my shoulders.</p><p>I took a sip and made a face at him. He smiled at me and my heart jumped. The man was a hottie\u2014there was no way around it.</p><p>As if sensing my thoughts, Costa held my eyes with his own, humor suddenly gone from his expression. \u201cMy brother,\u201d he said, voice rough.</p><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy brother was married to a succubus. She...\u201d He took a quick drink of the whiskey and swallowed hard.</p><p>\u201cWell, she fit the stereotype.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why you were so suspicious of me? So weird about how I was acting? Just because you knew one slutty succubus?\u201d I glared at him. \u201cGive me a break.\u201d</p><p>Costa shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but she really did a number on him. Fed from him, thralled and messed around with his friends. She even\u2014\u201d He stopped, took a drink from his beer. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter now. I shouldn\u2019t have assumed that all succubi were like her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe tried to seduce you, didn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>He stared at his beer and his face reddened as I watched.</p><p>\u201cShe got fucking close to succeeding, too.\u201d He looked up and his eyes met mine. They\u2019d darkened to salamander black, and it was as if I could feel heat radiating from him.</p><p>\u201cMy brother walked in with her wrapped around me half- naked. We haven\u2019t spoken since.\u201d</p><p>My chest constricted, and for a few agonizing moments I couldn\u2019t speak. I took in his bleak expression as he turned his attention back to his whiskey, and I finally found my voice. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t your fault. He shouldn\u2019t blame you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI almost fucked his wife; of course he should blame me!\u201d The beer bottle cracked in his grip, and he tossed it into the small trashcan by his feet.</p><p>\u201cWhen succubi have fed on someone, they get power.</p><p>She used her powers on you, and they would have been impossible for you to resist while you were in her presence.\u201d</p><p>I kept my tone calm, but inside, my mind reeled at the idea. I\u2019d known of succubi who would drink the essence of their partners for power and not stay with them. It was a risky practice that could lead to mental instability in the succubus. But for one to drink for a long period of time from one man and then still be willing and able to seduce and take from others?</p><p>The woman had to be a sociopath.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know that for sure.\u201d His voice cracked, as if he doubted the truth of my words himself.</p><p>\u201cI do know. You\u2019re a lot of things, Costa, but you\u2019re not the type to seduce his brother\u2019s wife.\u201d I forced a small smile. \u201cA bit of a wimp when it comes to being a passenger in a car driven by a perfectly good driver, but you\u2019re a good man.\u201d</p><p>Something like hope lit up his face, and his gaze turned from bleak to hungry. I slid my gaze down his strong arms, his muscled chest, and then back to his eyes. He blinked and his eyes changed again, but before I could take them in, he was pulling me to my feet and into his arms.</p><p>His lips touched mine as I wrapped my arms around his neck. Softly, his hands stroked my back, one settling on my lower back and the other moved down to graze my ass.</p><p>As he tugged me closer to him I gasped against his lips. He pulled back from my mouth and held me against him. His body was so hard, and I could feel how much he wanted me as he pressed against my stomach.</p><p>He stepped back and looked at me, anything but expressionless. Tense, his face was raw with desire. I knew I looked the same to him, and I didn\u2019t care.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to take advantage,\u201d he said slowly, as if choosing his words carefully. \u201cThis is an emotional time for you...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not taking advantage.\u201d I trailed my fingers down his chest, just grazing his shirt. \u201cI am a succubus\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that doesn\u2019t mean\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush,\u201d I whispered. \u201cLet me finish. The fact that you confided in me and trusted me enough to tell me what happened to you...\u201d His expression darkened, so I pushed past the personal. \u201cAnd that you followed my lead on the investigation, listened to my idea\u2014it means a lot.</p><p>Not everyone takes me seriously. Not beyond my ability to get confessions from testosterone-driven young men, anyway.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cYou\u2019re a first-class investigator, Mari.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t have said anything sexier.</p><p>I tugged on his shirt and he lowered his face for another kiss. His lips were hot on mine as he pulled me against him, but his skin was slightly cool to the touch. It seemed to grow warmer with each passing moment.</p><p>I wondered for a brief moment if this was a stupid idea, but then dismissed the worry. Whatever else he might be, Valerio Costa was a good man, and a good cop.</p><p>I was a succubus, and nothing would clear my mind and make me feel better than a good roll in the hay. I wouldn\u2019t feed from him. Taking energy from another person bound them to the succubus and vice versa. It was a sharing process that connected the woman and her lover through emotion and even memory. This would be something far more fleeting\u2014a rush to get through the sorrow.</p><p>I tugged at Costa\u2019s shirt, barely reaching the last two buttons before he yanked it off his shoulders. The white T-shirt he wore underneath soon followed, and I stopped for a moment to appreciate the view. The man was built.</p><p>His height\u2014he had to be at least six foot three inches\u2014 hid the amount of muscle he carried, making him appear lean. But he wasn\u2019t thin\u2014far from it. I felt small standing next to him, no easy feat for a woman nearly six feet tall in her work-height heels.</p><p>Costa kissed me again before his mouth slid down my neck to kiss my collarbone and shoulder. His hands ran down my sides and back up, almost tickling in their softness. He pulled my blouse over my head, and then ever so slowly, grazed my bra-covered breast with the back of his fingers. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My face heated as he took in my sexy bra. The panties matched, and the set was like all of my underthings\u2014 pretty, overpriced, and made of very little fabric. I didn\u2019t like to flaunt my succubus nature in the open\u2014aside from when it helped me solve cases\u2014but I did allow myself a bit of hidden allure.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful, my bella,\u201d he whispered, and my heart dropped.</p><p>You\u2019re more than beautiful to him, remember? And somehow, armed with that knowledge, the compliment seemed more real. Like something I\u2019d actually earned.</p> <p>Like something worth mentioning.</p><p>I melted into his arms and he pulled me closer, groaning into my mouth. He made quick work of my bra and the rest of my clothes while I took off his. I wanted\u2014 needed to feel him against me, inside me.</p><p>Suddenly, we were on the bed. He was on top of me and he trailed kisses down my neck and to my chest.</p><p>He took my nipple into his mouth and sucked while he massaged my other breast with his hand. Then he traced my skin as he moved his hand down, trailing heat as he slid it down my stomach. Ever so softly, he moved his hand between my legs.</p><p>When he touched me, I jumped.</p> <p>\u201cEasy,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>I could only moan in response as he palmed me, and then slid a finger into my heat. I gasped as he rubbed my most sensitive spot in a way that almost pushed me over the edge. Desperation touched me, and I suddenly needed him so badly I ached.</p><p>Could it really feel this good? The man was obviously an expert, but still. I\u2019d never been shy about my succubus nature. I\u2019d slept with men before\u2014more than my fair share, probably. But with him...it was different. I could feel him, feel his energy\u2014so close I just had to reach out to touch it, to taste him. So tempting...</p><p>The thought stilled me, and my mind whirled. I was not tempted to touch him with my succubus powers. No, I\u2019d never been tempted, not really. Did I already care about him that much?</p><p>My racing thoughts must have shown on my face, because he touched my chin lightly and stared into my eyes. \u201cNo thinking. Just feel.\u201d He rubbed his body against mine, and I could feel his cock between my legs, brushing against my wetness. I gasped and he smiled. \u201cYeah, bella.</p><p>Just like that.\u201d</p> <p>He moved his mouth to my nipples, and he sucked and nibbled them until I moaned. Pulling back, he watched me as he blew on one, making me shiver, and then he took it into his mouth again. Almost rough, he plucked and rolled and sucked until I couldn\u2019t think of anything but him. Then he slid down my front, kissing and licking his way until I could feel his breath against my inner thighs. I tensed in anticipation, and he nipped at my sensitive flesh.</p><p>Finally, he kissed me there. I gasped as his tongue touched me, caressed me, pushed me to the brink. And then lights flashed, my body tensed, and I fell over the edge, crying his name.</p><p>His chest brushed against my already sensitive breasts as he moved over me. His eyes met mine. Black, they were devoid of white cornea or pupil or iris. The mark of a salamander\u2014the eyes that were so similar to their inhuman cousins. As he slid into me, I moaned and closed my eyes, forgetting the strangeness of his.</p><p>He moved within me, thrusting hard, in delicious rhythm that had me gasping for air and clinging to him.</p><p>He reached between us and touched me, rubbing softly in rhythm with his thrusts. Stars clouded my vision and I whispered his name. He grunted and pushed into me hard, before spasming against me. I gripped the sheets and he threw back his head, calling my name.</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>Costa\u2019s arms were wrapped around me when I woke the next morning. My first instinct was to burrow deeper into the covers and my second was to flee. I\u2019m generally the sort of girl who follows her first instinct, so I snuggled a little closer. Costa murmured in his sleep and his embrace tightened around me.</p><p>The night had been magnificent and, despite the passion, I\u2019d gotten more rest in his bed than I had on my own all week. I grinned to myself. Exercise was good for sleep.</p> <p>I traced his smooth skin with my fingertips, and he wrapped his arms around me more tightly. God it felt good to be held. So good. Too good.</p><p>I blinked at the clock on the nightstand. Only seven.</p><p>We needed to get a move on, but at least we hadn\u2019t really overslept. He mumbled something and took a deep breath against my hair. I smiled. No reason we had to go right now. An extra half an hour certainly couldn\u2019t hurt.</p><p>A moment passed before I processed the click of the lock giving way. By then, the door was opening. I sat up, holding the sheet against my chest, and reached over to the nightstand. I tugged my gun from its holster and pointed it at the doorway.</p><p>Or to be more accurate, I pointed my gun at the gorgeous redhead who strolled into the room, carefully balancing donuts and coffee in her hands.</p><p>We stared at each other for a moment. Her green eyes narrowed, and then she raised an eyebrow at the man next to me. Costa pushed himself up on his elbows, and he frowned at our uninvited guest.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here, Beatrice?\u201d</p><p>I glanced at him. Was she uninvited after all?</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should get your little girlfriend to drop the gun before you start asking me stupid questions, Val.\u201d</p><p>Her voice was rich and smooth, and lower-pitched than I would have guessed. Sultry, that was the word.</p><p>\u201cPut down the gun, Mari. This is my partner, Beatrice Davis,\u201d he mumbled. Costa sat up on the edge of the bed and rubbed the sleep out of his eyes.</p><p>I frowned at him but lowered the gun.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Val. I knew you were hoping to use the succubus to lure out the perp, but I didn\u2019t know you were going to have to fuck her to do it.\u201d The redhead grimaced and set the coffee and donuts on the desk.</p><p>My hand flew to my mouth, and self-loathing coursed through me like a vile drug sent directly to my veins. A weight settled in on my chest, and I went very still. Use the succubus? Lure out the perp? Didn\u2019t know he\u2019d have to fuck her to do it?</p><p>\u201cGet the fuck out of here, Beatrice,\u201d Costa said, voice low and hard. Dangerous.</p><p>Beatrice shrugged and tossed her hair over her shoulder. \u201cWhatever, I\u2019ll be in the lobby while you two...</p><p>finish up in here.\u201d</p><p>The door slammed behind her, and I flinched.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let her get to you,\u201d Costa said, voice tight. But anger didn\u2019t cover his face, guilt did. He wouldn\u2019t meet my eyes; instead he looked down. \u201cLast time I leave a key for her. She can wait for me if she needs files from now on.\u201d</p><p>His expression carried all the confirmation I needed.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t breathe, couldn\u2019t think. I had to get out.</p><p>I grabbed my clothes and yanked them on. Costa was talking to me, but I couldn\u2019t hear him. I couldn\u2019t pause to listen to his bullshit. I had to go.</p><p>He grabbed me by my shoulders. \u201cListen to me, bella.\u201d</p><p>I stepped back, staring at the floor, and he released me. I couldn\u2019t look at him. If I looked at him I would cry.</p><p>And there was only so much humiliation I could take in one morning.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch me,\u201d I finally rasped out. \u201cYou will never fucking touch me again.\u201d I shoved past Costa and ran for the door. He didn\u2019t stop me.</p><p>To my utter horror, tears started to leak down my face as soon as I reached the lobby. I moved outside quickly, keeping my head down, and silently praying that Costa\u2019s partner wouldn\u2019t see me as I shuffled through the doors.</p><p>Once I hit the sidewalk, I strode to my car. Costa could find his own ride back to the station.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t cried when Elaine was taken\u2014not really. I hadn\u2019t cried when I\u2019d learned what they were going to do to her if I didn\u2019t find her in time and stop them. But this\u2014 crying over a man? What the hell was wrong with me? Oh sure, it didn\u2019t help that this hit on top of everything else.</p><p>And the piece of my mind that remained rational realized that given all the stressors in my life\u2014not to mention the lack of sleep\u2014this wasn\u2019t exactly a crazy response. That it was probably a delayed reaction, having more to do with Elaine than Costa and his rude partner. But the rest of my mind thought I was shallow. And so I cried harder.</p><p>I wallowed in my misery as I drove to my house. I couldn\u2019t do anything for Elaine until I got home and pulled calmed down, so I parked on the side of the road for a few minutes, quit fighting the tears, and let them fall.</p><p>Once I\u2019d gotten myself somewhat together and parked in front of my townhouse, I trudged up to my front door, not even bothering to pretend I walked with any sort of dignity.</p><p>Flipping Costa.</p><p>I took a quick shower, finally letting loose the last of my tears under the hot stream of water. I let the heat wipe away the pain and anger and humiliation. I let it comfort me.</p><p>Numb, I got dressed and then made myself a cup of tea. I sat down at my dining room table. I had to focus on finding Elaine, on figuring this out. Whatever Costa had intended anyway\u2014using me as bait aside\u2014didn\u2019t seem to be working. The perp was either too smart to try to kidnap a cop, especially a cop working his case, or I didn\u2019t fit the bill in some other way. I wasn\u2019t exactly in the age range of the average victim\u2014just a touch too old.</p><p>I pulled out the case files and started scanning them again, one by one. I made a list of the cities we knew about, and approximate date ranges that the kidnapper would need to have been in those cities. There were gaps, but I would bet that more than a few of those piles of ash had never been discovered, in who knows what cities, or\u2014 less likely\u2014that some of the succubi who had disappeared had never been reported missing.</p><p>According to my list, the perp would have been in Phoenix before Chicago\u2014kidnapping a succubus there.</p><p>And prior to that, Anchorage, where a pile of ashes proving to be those of an unknown otherworlder was found near a police station.</p><p>I\u2019d take it to Natalie, I decided. She hadn\u2019t called yet saying she\u2019d found anything, but the information couldn\u2019t hurt for her to have. It might make her search quicker, and an obvious suspect might even become apparent. Hope surged within me and suddenly I was on my feet, full of energy, and barely able to stop myself from racing out the door. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I called Natalie\u2019s office as I walked to my car. No answer, but I figured she\u2019d probably be in by the time I was able to drive there, so I headed for her office first. I drove with the radio blasting, focusing fully on the notes pounding in my brain to avoid thinking of anything else. But thoughts of Valerio Costa trickled in, forcing Bon Jovi\u2019s lyrics right out of my head. His crazy black salamander eyes\u2014eyes that should have been creepy, but were somehow intensely sexy. The conviction in his voice when he insisted I was a good investigator. And the way his arms held me, so safely against him while I slept.</p><p>Oh boy.</p><p>I skidded around a turn, glaring at the car behind me as they mashed their horn. No. I was not falling for Valerio Costa. I was not. The man had used me as bait.</p> <p>Even worse, he hadn\u2019t told me that was part of the plan.</p><p>Why had he slept with me? Because he wanted to keep me in his room in case the kidnapper came looking for me? Maybe. Maybe not. Maybe I was just overreacting because of the stress of Elaine\u2019s kidnapping.</p><p>But what if I wasn\u2019t?</p><p>A great weight settled onto my chest, pushing the air from my lungs, the hope from my thoughts. So I drove fast, sang loud, and did everything I could to keep Valerio Costa out of my head and away from my heart.</p><p>Natalie Leigh\u2019s building was as pristine as always. The morning light reflected off the building\u2019s dark glass, and that bit of brightness imbued me with hope. I walked inside, lost in my thoughts, and ran into what felt like a brick wall. Cool hands on my arms steadied me, and I looked up and met the gaze of a familiar face and the strong scent of herbs swirled around me. It took me a moment to place the large man as the one I\u2019d seen in the lobby when I\u2019d visited Natalie alone about the burned body case. He dropped his hands and stared at me, as if his eyes would bore through me, sweat gathering on his forehead.</p> <p>I stepped aside, uncomfortable. Did he work security for the building or something? A suit adorned his body, but he carried himself like professional muscle. He lugged a bag, and I wondered if that was where the herbal scent had come from. Perhaps he was a customer of Natalie\u2019s?</p><p>Or a supplier?</p><p>I felt his eyes on my back, and I waved at the receptionist. Recognizing me, she nodded and reached for the phone. The witch, it seemed, wasn\u2019t one for surprises. I didn\u2019t look back, but headed for the elevator. Encouraging the man by acknowledging him was a bad idea.</p><p>Waiting patiently for the elevator to ding, I checked my cell phone. Still no call from Costa. No half-assed explanations. No attempts to get me to listen. No screw- yous. The fact that he hadn\u2019t even tried to call somehow made it worse. It hadn\u2019t been long, of course. Yet if he really cared, wouldn\u2019t he have followed me out of the hotel?</p><p>But no. No chase. No call. No worries\u2014for him, anyway.</p><p>I grumbled and stuffed the phone back in my jacket as I boarded the elevator. I turned back and hit the button for Natalie\u2019s floor. The large man no longer watched me, and the revolving door still spun from his departure. One less thing to worry about.</p> <p>I knew should call Costa and give him a chance to explain. Tell him what I was taking to Natalie. That would be the mature thing to do. His partner was a bitch, but that didn\u2019t mean that he was as bad as her words made him appear. And I had a feeling that what he\u2019d confided in me the night before wasn\u2019t a story he told carelessly, if he\u2019d even shared it before. But as the light behind the numbers counted off the floors in the elevator, I couldn\u2019t force myself to take out my phone to make the call.</p><p>Natalie\u2019s office door stood ajar, but her office itself was empty. I frowned and rubbed my arms. Nothing appeared disturbed, no rustled papers or knocked-over chairs. Perhaps she just hadn\u2019t arrived for the day?</p><p>Her day planner sat on her desk, so I gave the office and waiting room a quick once-over and then flipped it open. Today, she showed appointments starting at seven o\u2019clock and going clear through eight tonight. For Natalie, appointments almost certainly meant she was in her casting room, which was situated down a hallway from her office. I\u2019d seen it once, when we cast the locator spell to find Elaine. A spell we\u2019d cast in vain.</p><p>I whistled under my breath. The rest of her upcoming week appeared just as full. When did she have time for a life? Or even to eat?</p><p>It was nine now, and her calendar listed an appointment from eight until ten. So where were they? Her note was in shorthand, but it looked like some sort of luck spell had been scheduled. A private client, then. The police department didn\u2019t believe in luck.</p><p>The door leading to the hallway between her office and spell room stood closed, and I considered for a moment going back there to see if she was busy casting. I grimaced. No. Probably not the smartest idea. Magic was tricky. I was no expert, but I was pretty certain that no one would be happy if I interrupted her spell. Who knew what the consequences could be? For all I knew, barging in there might make her blow us all up.</p><p>I glanced longingly at her computer, but jarring her mouse revealed the screen to be locked and that a password was needed. Just as well. How bad would it look if she walked in to find me on her computer? No way would she believe that I was just on there to Google some information while I waited. I suppressed a sigh and pulled out my phone. The screen was small and the speed wasn\u2019t up to what a real computer could do, but it would have to work.</p><p>I loaded the tiny browser and tapped my fingernails on her desk while I waited for the search screen to load. When the box finally popped up, I typed in \u201cAnchorage, Witch\u201d</p> <p>and hit enter. It might be a long shot, but Anchorage was out of the way. It wasn\u2019t exactly a bustling city for visiting Covenant members. A high level member\u2014or former member\u2014might earn a spot in the paper if news was slow.</p><p>The search came up with hundreds of pages of results, and I scrolled through the first page without clicking on any of the links. Most were for local coven\u2019s websites. The second page netted very similar results, with the exception of one link.</p><p>The Anchorage Daily News listed an article about a bigwig witch visiting for some sort of new bill signing. I hit the link and waited impatiently for it to load. After what felt like forever, the page slowly came up, one inch at a time on the small screen, almost too small to read. I zoomed in on the page and checked the date. Four months ago. Yes. That fit the range all right. I scrolled down and then stopped abruptly.</p><p>No flipping way.</p><p>The name stood out to me on the screen as if bolded, as did his very small but very happy face on the included picture. Viktor Koslov. That put him in the right city during the right timeframe for two incidences: Anchorage and Chicago. And he was a powerful witch, powerful enough to have twisted a succubus\u2019s powers. Chicago might be a coincidence, but Anchorage, too?</p><p>As I stared at the picture, something else caught my attention. A large man stood in the background. The man I\u2019d run into downstairs. My heart stopped.</p><p>Natalie.</p><p>If Koslov was involved in this, Natalie might not be safe. We\u2019d had her looking into witches capable of pulling off the power transfer. I pushed up from the chair and strode toward the door to her casting room, but my hand froze on the knob. So what if Viktor had been in Alaska with the creepy man from the lobby? He might be one witch of many, especially if the legislation they passed was a big enough deal for him to go there to show his approval.</p><p>What if I was wrong, and I walked in there and someone got hurt?</p><p>I gritted my teeth and stepped away from the door. I pulled my phone out and hit the back button. Thankfully, the search screen loaded quickly, and with shaking fingers I typed in, \u201cKoslov, Phoenix\u201d on the small screen.</p><p>Time moved even more achingly slowly as I waited for the results to load. Finally, after what felt like hours, the first page of results appeared. As I took in the short summary of the first listing, my breath caught in my throat.</p><p>Two months ago, Viktor Koslov had been in Phoenix.</p><p>Perfect timing for when the succubus disappeared, and near the time a pile of ash had been found as well.</p><p>The evidence was circumstantial but convincing. Not only could Koslov have committed the crimes, he\u2019d been in at least three cities at the right time to have done it. And according to Natalie, no witch would have been able to twist a succubus\u2019s power with the councilman in the same city without him knowing. The burned victims still didn\u2019t make sense unless...</p><p>An image of the professional muscle I\u2019d seen downstairs flashed in my mind, and I rubbed my arms against a sudden chill. Could that man be the key? His grip had been cool, like Costa\u2019s. Was the professional muscle a salamander?</p><p>He\u2019d smelled of herbs. Had Viktor sent him back for something? Natalie had to have rare, difficult-to-find herbs in her spell room. Maybe she\u2019d had something Viktor wanted badly enough to send his man back for them. Or even more likely, he\u2019d come back to make sure the scene was cleaned of anything that could be linked to Viktor.</p><p>I grabbed the knob and twisted, yanking open the door to the hallway that led to her casting room. Risks be damned. Natalie had to know as soon as possible that Viktor Koslov\u2014one of the most powerful witches in the country, if not the world\u2014was our kidnapper. Our killer.</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>Deafening silence hit me; the only noise touching my ears was my own frantic footsteps. I made my way down the hall to the casting room and, feeling awkward, knocked.</p><p>The noise echoed in the hallway, but no sounds answered it. I knocked once more before tentatively opening the door. I stepped back, but no lightning or fire or ice flew from the room to strike me. The room was dark.</p><p>\u201cHello? Natalie? It\u2019s Detective Whitman.\u201d I felt along the inside of the wall, fumbling until my fingertips touched a light switch. I flipped it on, then took in the room before me.</p><p>Spell ingredients littered the ground\u2014herbs intermingled with pieces of glass and wire. Scorches touched the walls and bookcases. Her circle, which had been etched into the concrete floor as well as painted, didn\u2019t look right. I stared at it for a moment before I realized that the paint had been smudged, nearly removed from a one-foot section. Deep scratches trailed across the etching. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>What the hell had happened? Burn marks\u2014maybe from the salamander? The scratches could have been from a dodged spell. A lethal one by the looks of the scraped floor. Maybe Natalie fought them and lost. I looked over the room one last time before deciding that I wasn\u2019t knowledgeable enough about witchcraft to figure out exactly what had happened, and then I headed back to her office.</p><p>Had she been taken? The room looked like it had been through a battle, and I was pretty certain that two witches fighting would probably create a mess at least that big. I flipped back a page in her planner and my stomach dropped. Last night, penciled in for seven thirty, was the name Viktor.</p><p>I plucked her phone from the cradle and looked at the screen. The fancy output had several sorts of lists, including who she\u2019d called, calls she\u2019d missed, and incoming calls she\u2019d actually answered. I thumbed through the list of outgoing calls for yesterday. Several before seven thirty.</p><p>I tried the first. A woman answered with an informal, \u201cHello?\u201d I muttered a, \u201cSorry, wrong number,\u201d and hung up the phone. The next number was to a deli down the street\u2014probably her lunch or dinner order. I got lucky on number three.</p> <p>La Maison.</p><p>One of the nicest hotels in the area, it was undoubtedly where Koslov stayed while he was in town. The building was also adjacent to the alley where we\u2019d found the burned remains.</p><p>\u201cViktor Koslov\u2019s room,\u201d I said to the operator.</p><p>\u201cOne moment, please.\u201d The phone clicked and started ringing through, and I slammed the phone back on the cradle.</p><p>This was all my fault. I glanced at Natalie\u2019s picture, propped on her desk. She smiled from the arms of an older woman. My stomach sank. I had to help her. And fast. I itched to call Costa, to tell him what was going on and get his opinion on where we should go from here, but I couldn\u2019t do that. It wasn\u2019t proper procedure, for one. I had to call this in to my boss. For another, I didn\u2019t trust Costa. Oh sure, I knew enough about him to know he wasn\u2019t a criminal, but that didn\u2019t make him trustworthy when it came down to it. I\u2019d only known the man for a few days, and his partner\u2019s words still reverberated through my mind.</p> <p>I picked up the phone to call the station. Vasquez was going to love this.</p><p>The lieutenant didn\u2019t sound happy to hear my news, but after the third time I went through all of the evidence\u2014 the dates, the M.O., the mess in Natalie\u2019s casting room\u2014 he conceded that I might be on to something.</p><p>\u201cAll right. But this had better be airtight, Whitman.</p><p>He\u2019s a goddamn Covenant council member. Are you still at the witch\u2019s office?\u201d Vasquez sounded irritated, but not angry. That was good. He might actually believe me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m at Natalie\u2019s, but I\u2019ll head over to La Maison.\u201d I tapped Natalie\u2019s pen against her desk and wished that I had called from my cell phone. At least I\u2019d be more mobile than I was calling from Natalie\u2019s landline.</p><p>\u201cThe hell you will,\u201d Vasquez grated. \u201cYou\u2019re to stay as far away from that hotel as possible. You\u2019re too close to this case, and I don\u2019t need any fuckups in the takedown.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis is my sister, Vasquez!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that.\u201d He lowered his voice. \u201cI\u2019m not saying you haven\u2019t done some damn good investigating here, Whitman. You\u2019ve gotten us enough to pick him up and search his room, at least. But you can\u2019t be there.\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d And with that jaw-dropping announcement hanging in the air, he muttered, \u201cI\u2019ll be in touch,\u201d and hung up the phone.</p><p>I gaped at the phone and tried to move past Vasquez\u2019s apology\u2014something akin to a meteor hitting a house in its rarity\u2014to try to plan my next move. I couldn\u2019t go to La Maison. Ignoring Vasquez in this would almost certainly cost me my badge. And what if we didn\u2019t catch Koslov?</p><p>Then I\u2019d be completely shut out. No, I couldn\u2019t go there.</p><p>I frowned and considered what I knew of Koslov and this perp\u2019s M.O. Chances were very slim that Elaine or Natalie would actually be at the hotel. It was a nice place and while I was certain they gave their best customers a lot of latitude, two kidnapped women would not go unnoticed or unreported. No. He\u2019d keep them somewhere no one would notice them. My money was still on a warehouse or other out of the way dump.</p><p>I took a file folder from my bag and then stared at the list that the vampire Magister had given us. Even with me, Costa, and the officers Vasquez had ordered to help, we\u2019d only checked half of the warehouses on the list. I looked at the plotted map and frowned. None of the warehouses were near La Maison, per se. Most were clear across town.</p><p>Only two dots stood out on the map that were anywhere near Koslov\u2019s hotel. He\u2019d want to keep her close, right?</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d I muttered. It was a long shot, but what else could I do? Going to the hotel wasn\u2019t an option. I might as well check out the warehouse. I couldn\u2019t just sit and wait to hear back from Vasquez.</p> <p>I locked Natalie\u2019s office door on my way out. It was an easy to open handle lock, but I didn\u2019t have a key for the door outside the waiting room, which could be secured with a sturdy deadbolt. Then I took the elevator down to the lobby and stopped at the reception desk. \u201cWhen was the last time you saw Natalie Leigh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d she asked, raising an eyebrow at my tone.</p><p>I flashed my badge to remind her that I wasn\u2019t just a pretty face, and asked her again. \u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cNo idea. A few days, I guess. I see her going to lunch occasionally, or out for appointments.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDays?\u201d I asked incredulously.</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t check in with me; I work for the whole building. She\u2019ll send her schedule down occasionally.</p><p>E-mail me when she doesn\u2019t want walk-ins. But other than you cops she doesn\u2019t get a lot of unexpected traffic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. No one goes into Natalie Leigh\u2019s office,\u201d I told the woman. \u201cNo one except cops. Got it?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened, and she nodded hurriedly. Backup would arrive soon. It would have to do. I couldn\u2019t wait around for them, even if they weren\u2019t under orders from Vasquez to keep me there, which they probably were.</p><p>I headed for my car and hoped that Koslov was already being cuffed.</p><p>Of the two warehouses that were closest to La Maison, I decided the one by the lake was probably the most likely place. It was slightly farther from the hotel than the other building but was situated in a more industrial area. The other building looked like it might just be close enough to a nearby strip mall for noise to be overheard. Other than a few distant large plants and some storage units, the one I chose to check first was quite isolated.</p><p>I parked a block from the warehouse and examined my phone. I should call Costa. I knew that. But I\u2019d be damned if it wasn\u2019t difficult. I considered calling Mac instead, but she\u2019d almost definitely been pulled in for the arrest at the hotel. Besides, I didn\u2019t want to put her job in jeopardy. Astrid would be much the same. Calling anyone on the freak squad was a bad idea. The ones who would help me could endanger their careers by doing so. The rest\u2014like Vasquez\u2014would order me expressly not to do what I planned. My only hope of a career after this was not receiving that direct order. That left Costa.</p><p>And his freakishly stunning redheaded partner.</p><p>I ground my teeth and hit his number. Three rings and it went to voice mail.</p><p>\u201cFlipping A,\u201d I muttered. Was Costa in on the hotel bust, too? I didn\u2019t think Vasquez would likely be willing to pull the OWEA agent in for the bust, but if he hadn\u2019t had a choice...Costa could have been at the station when I called. It would have been difficult to hide an operation like that from the OWEA agent if he\u2019d been in the building at the time. Forgetting to call him was one thing, something Vasquez might do. Lying to an OWEA agent\u2019s face was something else altogether.</p><p>Maybe he just didn\u2019t want to talk to me.</p><p>Swallowing around a lump in my throat, I redialed his number. This time it went straight to voice mail. I took a deep breath and said, \u201cI\u2019m checking a warehouse near La Maison. Not sure if Vasquez filled you in, but I think our guy might be keeping them here\u2014Elaine and Natalie.\u201d I let out the breath in a big whoosh. If Vasquez hadn\u2019t explained everything to Costa, he was out of luck.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t leave all the details on his voice mail. I didn\u2019t have the time or the patience. I left the address of the warehouse in a long rush and then hit end on my phone.</p><p>At least someone would know where I was.</p><p>I left the car parked a couple of blocks from the warehouse, and then pulled a crowbar and flashlight from my trunk.</p><p>Getting in and out quickly was more important than making a quick getaway\u2014I hoped. I stood by a building next to the one owned by the Chevaliers and did my best to stay out of sight. I kept my gun in its holster and carried the crow bar in one hand and the flashlight in the other.</p><p>The warehouse was old, but not as old as the ones we\u2019d looked at across town. The metal was rusting in places, but it didn\u2019t look ready to fall over any second.</p><p>The only window I could see was in the front door, along the top. Enter through the back or the front? Finally I decided to make my way to the back. I strode around and approached from behind, careful to do my best to appear I belonged. Sneaking around would cause more suspicion if someone saw me. Then again, in this area, dressed as I was in my neat skirt suit and short heels, just the sight of me was likely to draw attention.</p><p>Mud squicked around my shoes as I made my way to the back door. An even bigger window than the one that graced the front door was built into it, paned by small pieces of wood forming smaller windows. But the room beyond was dark, so I was just going to have to take a chance.</p><p>I smashed the small piece of glass closest to the deadbolt and then paused, listening. My heart thudded so loudly it was hard to make out anything else. So I stopped and breathed, trying to calm myself, trying to listen.</p><p>Nothing. I removed what I could of the glass with the crowbar and then reached in and turned the lock. Then, very slowly, I turned the handle and pushed the door. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The room beyond was dark, and I turned on my flashlight to see beyond the small space illuminated by the open door. The cobwebs in the corners of the room suggested the place was vacant, and the layer of dust on an old desk in one corner supported the suggestion. My shoulders dropped. It had been a small chance, but I\u2019d hoped.</p><p>I shook my head. Search this place or move on?</p><p>Moving on to the next warehouse seemed like the best idea. Wasting time here wouldn\u2019t get me anything.</p> <p>I stepped back, then reached for the door when something caught my eye. Dirt and grime covered the floor\u2014mostly. A small trail of less-dirty spots went from the door through to the opening into the next room.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t clean, and there was nothing so obvious as footprints, but less dust coated its surface that the ones around it.</p><p>I frowned and chewed on the inside of my lip. A caretaker could have walked through here. Perhaps one of the Chevaliers who routinely checked out the properties?</p><p>Maybe. But maybe not.</p><p>I slid my hand over my gun and stepped back into the warehouse, making my way farther in as quietly as I could.</p> <p>My gun caught a bit in the holster, and I tugged to get it out. I struggled with my flashlight and the crowbar in my other hand, before finally finding a balance that allowed me to hold both, if a bit precariously.</p><p>The air was cool and faintly damp\u2014tinged with other things. Scents that made me think of back alleys and bars. I stopped and peered around a corner, swinging my flashlight and gun as I moved. Nothing.</p><p>As I crept forward, careful to avoid rustling the papers that appeared haphazardly along the floor, a bit of light caught my attention. That couldn\u2019t be the outside, could it?</p><p>It seemed too close to be some sort of break in the wall, too minute to be a small window.</p><p>My flashlight revealed a door. To creep or to fling?</p><p>I frowned. If a Covenant witch and his bodyguard were behind that door, they\u2019d hardly be impressed by the noise and sound of me hurling open the door and shouting \u201cpolice\u201d at them. No, sneakiness was best. Besides, if I were lucky at all, they were being arrested at La Maison as I crept through the dirty warehouse.</p> <p>I opened the door slowly, wincing as it creaked. The light was on. Electricity ran in this warehouse. Excitement surged through me and I stepped into the room.</p><p>Movement across the room immediately caught my attention. My eyes met Viktor Koslov\u2019s, and I swung the gun around without preamble.</p><p>\u201cPolice!\u201d I shouted, and then I cried out as I felt pain surge from my hand and shoot up my arm. My gun clanked to the floor and I risked a glance. Blisters grew and bubbled on the backside of my hand, and tears sprang to my eyes. The pain overwhelmed me as I took in the damage to my flesh.</p><p>Koslov smiled and nodded to my side. I followed his gaze, blinking through the tears. Tall and built like a linebacker, the man from the lobby stood, arm outstretched, with eyes as black as night.</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>Faced with the salamander ready to burn me, and the Covenant witch ready to do who knew what to me, I raised my hands, wincing as the skin stretched with the movement. The burn hadn\u2019t reached my palm but rather had only touched the outside of my hand, extending from the middle knuckle of my fingers to several inches of my arm above my wrist. So he couldn\u2019t burn just anything, or he would have burned my palm, I figured. Directionally based? Like a person standing with a hose, he could point it and shoot, but not otherwise direct the flow of power? I should have asked Costa.</p><p>\u201cKeep your hands up, Ms. Whitman,\u201d Koslov ordered.</p><p>He nodded to the salamander and the big man took a step toward me.</p> <p>My foot slid back as if it had a mind of its own and that mind was set to get the heck out of there. As the salamander raised a hand toward me, I swallowed hard.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t worry, Detective. Leon is merely going to search you. You will be quite unharmed, I promise. Of course, your continued health is dependent upon your cooperation.\u201d The council member flashed a smile at me, and I supposed he thought it a comforting expression. I suppressed a shudder at the creepiness.</p><p>The salamander tossed my flashlight and crowbar into a corner of the room and picked my gun up from the floor, tucking it into his belt. Then he searched me quickly and with a brisk efficiency and confidence. Former law enforcement?</p><p>This got better and better.</p><p>\u201cI just want my sister,\u201d I said, then added, \u201cand Natalie.</p><p>You guys can go, get out of town. I never saw you here.\u201d</p><p>Koslov chuckled, but Leon maintained his expressionless demeanor. \u201cOh yes, Detective. I\u2019m sure that you\u2019ll keep your word when we leave.\u201d Koslov\u2019s humor faded. \u201cWho knows that you are here?\u201d</p><p>I snorted. \u201cEveryone, of course. I called for backup on my way in.\u201d I had, sort of. Although a quick call to Costa hardly equated with really calling in the cavalry. But Koslov had no way of knowing that.</p><p>\u201cLie.\u201d Koslov gave me a small smile. \u201cNice try, but I\u2019m a witch, Detective. And not an idiot.\u201d His gaze traveled down my body, but there was no real desire on his face, no lust. He looked at me with the cold calculation of a car salesman checking out the trade-in. Finally, he pursed his lips and said, \u201cWell you\u2019re not as...young as I would like.</p><p>But you\u2019re definitely attractive enough. Isn\u2019t she, Don?\u201d</p><p>Leon grunted.</p><p>\u201cThe police background will certainly reduce your value. Unless...\u201d He snapped his fingers and a smile of pure greed appeared on his face. \u201cOh yes. This will be just fine. I\u2019m sure I have some potential customers who would like to work out on you some lingering issues with law enforcement, Detective.\u201d</p><p>The corner of my lip rose into a snarl and I struggled to keep my cool. \u201cJust give me the women. Do you really think I was too stupid to call in for backup before barging in here?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cOh yes. I think you were just that stupid.</p><p>That\u2019s the thing about you cops\u2014especially otherworlders.</p><p>Always with something to prove. You\u2019re all a bunch of wannabe cowboys.\u201d</p><p>Dammit. I was stupid. But Costa would come for me, wouldn\u2019t he? He\u2019d check his voice mail and head here, especially once they figured out that Koslov wasn\u2019t at the hotel. I just had to delay them.</p><p>\u201cPut her in a room by the other two,\u201d Koslov ordered.</p><p>He turned to a small desk with a laptop sitting on top of it that was situated farther into the room. The desk stood out in sharp contrast\u2014new and shiny in a room full of old, dirty things. Apparently Koslov didn\u2019t like the idea of working at one of the old, dirty desks stacked in the corner of the room.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d I called. When all else failed, try to get them to discuss their glorious plans.</p><p>\u201cReally, Detective?\u201d He crossed his arms. \u201cTrying to get a villainous monologue out of me is the best you can do?\u201d</p><p>Crap. \u201cWell, I\u2019m curious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo sorry to disappoint you, but I\u2019m hardly going to discuss my affairs with a woman\u2014a succubus besides.\u201d He turned back to the desk and the salamander took a step toward me.</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re moving on from succubi? Surely the market for sirens isn\u2019t as flush.\u201d</p><p>He stiffened, whether it was because I knew more than he\u2019d expected me to, or because he was just getting irritated at my prattle, I wasn\u2019t sure. His salamander paused and glanced at Koslov.</p><p>\u201cI mean, I get the succubi thing. Pet sex slave that you can drain, that\u2019s gotta be pretty damn appealing to a lot of scum-suckers. But sirens?\u201d I shrugged. \u201cI just don\u2019t see the point. I mean, when a siren\u2019s power is used, sure you can control a person for a brief period of time, but they always remember that they were controlled afterward. And using a siren\u2019s power is treated the same by the law as using a gun.\u201d</p><p>Koslov turned to me, expression dark. He\u2019d nearly reached his desk. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t expect you to understand, succubus.\u201d He named my species with such venom I started, and I thought I saw Leon stiffen next to me. \u201cIn fact, I wouldn\u2019t expect much at all from you. Heaven forbid you have enough imagination to consider the benefits of being able to drain a siren of its powers. While you don\u2019t get the long-term power over a person that succubus powers provide, you do get their unwavering obedience during the song and for a time after. The song can be used to eliminate any witnesses as well.\u201d</p><p>I mentally winced, and Leon shifted his weight beside me. That was true enough. If a criminal had no morals, they could use the siren\u2019s song to make a victim kill themselves in any number of ways before the effect faded. \u201cThen why do you keep killing them?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, raising his hands up as he did. \u201cSuccubi were quite easy; it was merely a bend of their inherent powers. A reversal, if you will. But sirens are not built to transfer power...the results are unpredictable and irreversible.\u201d His smile returned. \u201cBut don\u2019t you worry your pretty head about it. I\u2019ll figure it out. And if a few bitches die in the process...\u201d He shrugged and the smile that blossomed on his face made bile rise in my throat.</p><p>Whatever other goals moved him, I\u2019d bet my badge that Koslov\u2019s primary motivation was hurting his victims.</p><p>I snorted. \u201cDoesn\u2019t seem likely. I hope you don\u2019t run out of succubi anytime soon. Maybe you\u2019ll have to move on to incubi\u2014and they\u2019re still pretty tough to find. Hope you have some women in your buyer ranks. Or maybe incubi just don\u2019t move you in the same way?\u201d I watched his face carefully as I spoke, and the slight snarl that arose at my question clinched it for me. Koslov had a serious issue with women.</p><p>It fit.</p><p>He kidnapped female-only species, and succubi and sirens were women who could control people with their powers. \u201cSo what woman pissed you off, Koslov? Let me guess, Mommy was a little controlling? She didn\u2019t hug you enough?\u201d I lowered my voice, as if I had an intimate secret to share. \u201cOr maybe she hugged you a little too much?\u201d</p><p>He snarled something in Russian at me, and then said, \u201cGet her the fuck out of here!\u201d to Leon. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGuess you\u2019re just not good enough to do anything other than bend nature, anyway,\u201d I called out, keeping my smug grin firmly affixed to my face, but inside my chest my heart beat wildly, and I felt like I might explode from the tension. \u201cBesides. I\u2019m guessing that your succubus power transfers are highly exaggerated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t think so.\u201d He smirked and sauntered toward Leon. Koslov reached up and touched the taller man\u2019s shoulder, then slid his hand down, caressing the salamander\u2019s arm. Leon shuddered, and a muscle in his jaw twitched. Then Koslov stepped away and headed back toward his desk. Leon reached out and grabbed my arm, his grip iron against my skin.</p><p>My mouth dropped open and the pieces in my mind fell into place. No wonder the burned bodies had been left in such precarious places. He was controlling the salamander using succubus thrall? Holy hell, I didn\u2019t even want to know the lengths he\u2019d had to go to in order to establish that control. Succubi powers were inseparably linked to sex. Had he been abusing Leon in the same way he set up the succubi he sold to be abused? Was he sleeping with him? Or was it rape?</p> <p>I swallowed hard against the bile rising in my throat and looked at the salamander. God, was that why he\u2019d stared at me, so oddly intense? I should have seen it. Should have noticed that he was trying to tell me something. Should have picked up on Koslov\u2019s magic.</p><p>I shook my head slightly. That\u2019s why Koslov had seemed just a little more charismatic than normal when I met him in Natalie\u2019s office. He carried the unconscious powers of a succubus as well\u2014a small amount, anyway.</p><p>I should have picked up on that. But there was no point in berating myself about it now. I\u2019d have all the time in the world to mentally scold myself after Elaine was safe.</p><p>Right now I had to concentrate on freeing her.</p><p>Across the room, Koslov\u2019s grin widened as he watched my expression. He knew. He knew that I had figured out what he was doing, how he was controlling his pet salamander, and my horror amused him. Leon\u2019s grip loosened on my arm, and I wondered if he was merely waiting for orders or if he again struggled with Koslov\u2019s influence.</p> <p>If Leon was already struggling against the witch\u2019s control enough to leave hints for the police to find, could I free him with my own ability? I couldn\u2019t reverse Koslov\u2019s thrall, but maybe with a touch of my own power, it would weaken the witch\u2019s hold just enough for Leon to break free. All I had to do was drink in some of his energy, and a small amount of thrall would naturally pass to him. I\u2019d never used it that way, but I knew that it was possible. The closest I\u2019d ever come was trying to make myself appear even more attractive to my prom date in high school. I\u2019d kept his attention, all right. But it hadn\u2019t kept the jerk from dumping me two weeks later for another girl.</p><p>\u201cTake her, Leon.\u201d Koslov made his way to the desk, and his voice had regained its coolness, its calm. His interest in me gone.</p><p>Leon released my arm and motioned for me to go ahead, down a hallway to the right of where I\u2019d come in. I stiffened my spine and walked past him.</p><p>A loud crash sounded behind us, and I pivoted around just in time to see Leon do the same.</p><p>\u201cPolice,\u201d Costa shouted as he entered the room.</p><p>He\u2019d decided on the dramatic entrance.</p> <p>Hope surged until I saw Leon raise his hands. I didn\u2019t know how his power compared to Costa\u2019s, but I knew Costa could be burned. The OWEA agent\u2019s attention was firmly focused on Koslov, and he wouldn\u2019t even have a chance to defend himself against the other salamander.</p><p>I grabbed Leon\u2019s arm, but he ignored me. Desperately I reached for his energy and tried to pull, but failed. I could feel it, but I couldn\u2019t touch it. Of course I couldn\u2019t touch it. Succubi powers were heavily connected to sex and, barring that, desire. Other strong emotions could trigger succubus powers as well, but none so reliably as lust.</p><p>Dammit.</p><p>Leon tried halfheartedly to buck me off while taking a couple of stumbling steps toward Costa. Koslov had a hand raised at Costa, and was speaking\u2014spewing lies to get Costa to let his guard down, no doubt. But Costa was having none of it. He shouted at Koslov again to get on the ground.</p><p>Grabbing energy was tricky business, especially for a succubus who never used that side of her power. But I could do this; it was as natural for me as breathing. It had certainly felt natural last night, when I had to force myself not to take energy from Costa. My heart leaped into my throat.</p><p>Costa. That was it.</p><p>I blinked through the tears in my eyes and tried again, grabbing the salamander\u2019s body in a full hug. He grunted in surprise, but didn\u2019t move his focus from Costa. He knew who the real threat was, or perhaps he was under specific orders from Koslov to protect him first.</p><p>I held on tightly, pain throbbing its way from my hand up my arm, and tried to think of Costa. I pushed away the outside world where Costa shouted at Koslov and Leon tried to squirm away from me. I thought of our night together. Of how he made me feel. Of how Costa\u2019s power felt licking along my skin while he made love to me. All the while, I reached for Leon\u2019s power. After a few seconds, it clicked.</p> <p>A flash of worry shot through me. Was Costa watching? Would my actions confirm to him that I was just another succubus looking for a fix? And most haunting of all, would siphoning power from Leon change me?</p><p>Leon\u2019s power jumped from his skin to caress mine, shoving all of my worries and fears away with its seductive power. I could feel it, just a small drain on him, but it was there. Spurred by my success, I kept Costa firmly in my mind and tried to open the flow even more. The power no longer caressed, it burned with a slow pleasant heat.</p><p>Flowing from his skin to mine, it rode my veins, racing through them into my head in a rush of power so heady I barely kept my grip on the large man. I gasped as the energy started to pour into me, and the power combined with the magic and thoughts of Costa heated my blood and made me suddenly ache to be back in his arms.</p><p>Then it wasn\u2019t just Costa and me in my thoughts. Leon was there, too. A man I knew almost nothing about. His emotions flitted through me. Despair. Lust. Helplessness.</p><p>Love.</p><p>Rage so fierce it shook me to my core.</p><p>Leon growled and yanked me off his back, tossing me into the room with Costa and Koslov. I landed hard on my side, and the air flew from my lungs. I struggled up to my knees and looked back at Leon. The salamander, as if the small gesture of tossing me had taken his strength, fell to one knee and his head dropped. He looked around, dazed.</p><p>My mind fogged, and thoughts\u2014important thoughts\u2014 stayed just outside of my grasp. I looked around dumbly.</p><p>Only seconds had passed since I\u2019d jumped on Leon, but it felt like forever. Long enough to get caught up in the man\u2019s explosive emotions. Long enough to get to know Koslov\u2019s captive salamander just enough to hurt for him.</p><p>Long enough to almost lose myself in a man I didn\u2019t even know.</p><p>Costa was shouting something at Koslov, but the witch ignored him and seemed to be muttering under his breath.</p><p>A bit of a green plant peeked out from his tightly clasped fist, and I yelled, \u201cHe\u2019s doing a spell!\u201d at Costa.</p><p>\u201cPut it down, Koslov,\u201d Costa said, his voice loud but calm.</p><p>Koslov muttered a final word and tossed the herb at us, and then dove under the desk. Costa shot, but I couldn\u2019t tell if he connected with Koslov because the room was suddenly filled with black smoke that coiled and then sprang around the room like a living thing. Unnatural and dark.</p><p>I cursed under my breath. A smoke spell to cover his escape? Nice move, but there were only so many ways out of the room. I resisted the urge to cough and fought to see through the acrid magical air.</p><p>As my throat and mouth burned, I realized we weren\u2019t dealing with a simple smoke spell. Dammit. Poison. I struggled to keep my mouth closed, but my eyes burned and my stomach rolled. Darkness threatened to overtake me, but I couldn\u2019t leave, not with Costa trapped. The smoke cleared enough to make out impressions of the men in the room, but I couldn\u2019t seem to shout for Costa, warn him.</p><p>My mouth and lungs weren\u2019t working right.</p><p>A shape moved next to me and I reached out, grasping at clothes. Koslov, it had to be. The shape struggled and cursed at me, but I clung to it, ignoring the pain as one of my nails felt like it ripped from my fingertip. My other hand still hurt so badly it was hard to hold on, but I held.</p><p>Until I saw the fire.</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>The flames moved up Koslov\u2019s body, still difficult to see even as the smoke spell began to fade. Because as it disappeared, it was replaced by smoke from the fire licking his body. It traveled fast\u2014too fast to be natural. From his stomach, it moved down to his shoes and up to touch his face.</p><p>I scrambled away from the flames, and the burn on my hand throbbed, bile crawled up my throat, and even though the smoke was clearing, it curled up in my lungs. I had to find Elaine and Natalie. Had to get them out before the fire spread. I stumbled to the hallway and then glanced back to yell for Costa. I was able to make out Koslov in the darkened air. His screams cut through the smoke, so loud it was as if they came out of the throat of a banshee.</p><p>And Leon, arms outstretched toward Koslov, grimaced, even as he burned the man who\u2019d taken away his free will. Tears trailed their way down his soot-stained face.</p><p>Suddenly Costa was there, arm around me, pulling me to the hall that Leon had been dragging me toward. I swallowed the bile in my throat and looked away from the scene behind me. Elaine had to be back there. And given Leon\u2019s frame of mind, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he burned the whole damn building down around us. We had to find Elaine and Natalie before that happened and get them\u2014 and ourselves\u2014out of the building.</p><p>The air cleared the farther down the hallway we got.</p><p>Doors lined the walls. My lungs burned, but the farther we moved from the smoke, the more the spells\u2019 effects dissipated.</p><p>\u201cElaine,\u201d I croaked as loudly as I could. \u201cNatalie?\u201d</p><p>No muffled sounds greeted us\u2014not that I could hear over the waning screams behind us. \u201cOh my god, Costa.</p><p>What if they aren\u2019t here?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThey are,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have to be. Koslov probably just has a spell up to dampen sound.\u201d</p><p>Costa kicked down the first door and I kicked at the next, wishing I\u2019d had the presence of mind to grab my crowbar from the floor where Leon had tossed it. These doors stood between Elaine and me\u2014maybe the very one I was trying desperately to break. I had to get it down.</p><p>The cries no longer sounded from down the hall, and I wasn\u2019t sure if I hoped that was because Koslov was no longer suffering or because of a sound dampening spell that draped the entire section of the hall we walked in, keeping the sounds within a certain distance of their origin.</p> <p>The door I worked on finally gave, and I almost fell into the room, my knee screaming in protest as my foot hit the ground. Light from the hallway poured into the room, and I stared dumbly at Elaine.</p><p>Dark circles surrounded her eyes and she looked thinner than she had a week before, but she stared at me\u2014 wide-eyed and tied to a chair. Alive. I called something to Costa, and after a few second he appeared with a pocketknife to cut Elaine free. She flung herself into my arms. Adrenaline rushed through my body, and I squeezed her tight.</p><p>Costa was there, pulling me again. Elaine clung to me as we moved, and I saw Natalie, looking slightly rumpled but otherwise unharmed, next to Costa. She rubbed her wrists where she\u2019d no doubt been restrained as well. I followed them down what felt like a never-ending hallway, half carrying Elaine with me. Then there was light. Fresh air filled my aching lungs. And sirens wailed loudly.</p><p>I held Elaine and Costa held us both until a paramedic took her from my arms. I followed them, but then Elaine was surrounded, and I was forced to hover around the edge of the bodies questioning her. Then Astrid was there, giving me water and asking questions that I couldn\u2019t seem to pull my mind together well enough to answer.</p><p>A paramedic asked me something, but talking hurt my smoke-burned throat, and all I could stutter out was a question about Elaine.</p> <p>\u201cWhat the fuck were you thinking?\u201d Vasquez asked, and I blinked at him. I hadn\u2019t even seen him approach.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said, my voice low and raspy. The water I\u2019d forced down had helped\u2014but it wasn\u2019t a miracle cure.</p><p>He grimaced at my voice. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk about this tomorrow. Don\u2019t think you\u2019re free and clear on this stunt.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, and immediately regretted the motion. I wasn\u2019t sure if the smoke inhalation or the use of my very rusty conscious succubus powers was responsible, but something had given me a heck of a headache. But I was alive, and I\u2019d see as many doctors as they wanted to throw at me after I got Elaine set up in the hospital.</p><p>Vasquez stomped off, and I saw him corner Costa near the ambulance. They were moving Elaine inside the vehicle, so I pushed up from the police car I\u2019d been sitting on and headed for my sister.</p><p>Someone tall blocked my path, and it took me a few beats to wrap my mind around the red hair, the pursed lips, and the striking features.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t have time to talk to you, Agent,\u201d I rasped, putting as much bitchiness into my voice as I could.</p><p>Beatrice raised an eyebrow at that. \u201cYou have your sister now. I\u2019d say you have nothing but time.\u201d My gaze flew back to Elaine. Yes. They were definitely loading her up to go to the hospital. I needed to get into that ambulance.</p><p>She spared a quick glance over her shoulder, and when she looked back at me her expression had softened. \u201cLook, I just wanted to tell you that I was sorry. I acted like a real bitch at the hotel. You didn\u2019t deserve that, and neither did Val. I get...protective of him sometimes.\u201d A smile touched her face, taking her from merely gorgeous to breathtaking.</p><p>\u201cOkay, scratch that. I get downright jealous.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t deal with this right now. I couldn\u2019t think about Costa or his ridiculously attractive partner. \u201cI need to get on that ambulance,\u201d I said simply, and then shouldered past her. I waved at the paramedic who held the door and he paused, understanding. I threw a quick glance over my shoulder before jumping into the ambulance. But Costa was no longer talking to Vasquez\u2014the OWEA agent was gone.</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>I stared at my teacup and tried to make plans for the day.</p><p>Nearly a week had passed since Costa and I had saved Elaine and Natalie from the warehouse fire. The questions started only minutes after we\u2019d escaped from the building.</p> <p>Questions from the paramedics about Elaine. Questions from Lieutenant Vasquez about Koslov. Questions from OWEA agents about Costa. So many damn questions, and all I wanted was to go home.</p><p>But I\u2019d heard nothing from Costa. I knew that he had to be up to his ears with his own questions and reports and who knew what else, but I didn\u2019t have to be happy about it. Luckily my burns were easily treated on an outpatient basis. I just had to be careful with the bandages for the first few days. And Koslov\u2019s spell had been short-lived. My lungs and throat were raw, but as long as I kept my voice down, it didn\u2019t bother me too much.</p><p>Movement in the entryway between the hall and kitchen drew my attention. Elaine, arms crossed with a frown creasing her face, leaned against the doorframe.</p><p>\u201cAny word?\u201d she said simply.</p><p>I shook my head. I\u2019d told her what happened during her kidnapping\u2014most of it, anyway.</p><p>\u201cYou should call him.\u201d Her voice was firm. Strong.</p><p>Like she hadn\u2019t just been held against her will for several days. Of course, she couldn\u2019t hide the full impacts from me.</p><p>I\u2019d heard her screaming in her sleep. I\u2019d woken her from the nightmares.</p><p>\u201cYou should be resting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m tired of resting. Why don\u2019t you just call him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause there\u2019s no point.\u201d I took a sip of my tea and turned my eyes back to the table.</p><p>\u201cMari, look at me.\u201d</p><p>I took a deep breath and met her eyes, the same clear blue I saw in the mirror every morning. \u201cI\u2019m here for you,\u201d</p><p>I said firmly. \u201cI don\u2019t have time or energy to worry about Costa. You are my priority.\u201d</p><p>Tears welled in her eyes, and I\u2019d crossed the room to pull her into my arms before I realized I\u2019d moved. She squirmed and pushed me away, stepping back so she could capture my gaze again.</p><p>\u201cStop this. You can\u2019t keep me any safer than you already do. And I refuse to live my life in fear again. I lost years of my life that way. Years, Mari. And I cost you years of your life, too.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head furiously, but she didn\u2019t stop talking.</p><p>\u201cYou deserve this, big sister. You deserve a chance to be happy. You deserve a man who will make you happy.</p><p>And if there\u2019s one thing I learned from all of this, it\u2019s that life can end at any time. We both need to live to the fullest while we can.\u201d</p><p>I opened my mouth to argue, but the doorbell rang, startling me, and I sloshed some of my tea onto the table.</p><p>A smile flashed on Elaine\u2019s face. \u201cI\u2019ll be upstairs,\u201d she said, and then she turned and hurried away.</p><p>\u201cDid you call him?\u201d I hissed after her. But she just waved over her shoulder at me and disappeared up the stairs.</p><p>I took a deep breath and opened the door. Costa\u2019s expression was serious, and I had to restrain myself from jumping into his arms the moment I saw him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t call,\u201d he said, stepping into the house.</p><p>I looked away from him, suddenly fighting a lump in my throat. \u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d I finally managed.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not, but I wasn\u2019t able to call anyone. The fire... They suspected me, at first until they questioned all the witnesses. And then enough time passed that it seemed like it would be better for me to just come here, talk to you in person.\u201d He closed the door and stepped closer to me.</p><p>\u201cAnd Elaine called you,\u201d I muttered, feeling somehow betrayed. I\u2019d known Costa had been implicated but hadn\u2019t realized they\u2019d given him such a hard time. After all, they\u2019d interviewed me and I\u2019d told them about Leon.</p><p>But considering what had happened, I wasn\u2019t surprised by their extra thoroughness.</p><p>\u201cThere was that, yes.\u201d</p><p>His expression was something I\u2019d never seen on him.</p><p>Unsure and hesitant. A little sad. Suddenly I wanted nothing more than to wipe that sadness from his face. But I couldn\u2019t. Not yet.</p><p>\u201cExplain to me what the hell happened in your hotel room.\u201d Flashes of Bea\u2019s face hit me, and the humiliation I\u2019d felt that morning came back in a rush. I stepped back, needing room between us.</p><p>\u201cBea questioned why I\u2019d be working with you on this. I told her it was because I wanted to keep you close in case the kidnapper went for you.\u201d He grimaced and shoved his hands in his pockets. \u201cThat was bullshit, of course. It wouldn\u2019t have made any sense for the bastard to come after you, a cop. There were plenty of easier succubi around who would have made more sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she believed you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe knew I was full of shit.\u201d He snorted. \u201cBut she wasn\u2019t in town, so there wasn\u2019t much she could do until...\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cWere\u2014are you involved with her or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d he said, and he stepped forward and grasped my shoulders. Startled, I looked up and met his eyes. He dropped his hands to his sides, and stepped back. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. No. We\u2019re close. We\u2019ve been partners for years, and we\u2019ve been through some shit together. But it\u2019s not like that. Not for me, at least. She\u2019s like a sister to me. She\u2019s just protective.\u201d</p><p>I believed him. I wasn\u2019t sure if it was Beatrice\u2019s apology after the fire, or the desperation in his eyes that did it, but I knew he was telling the truth.</p><p>\u201cI should have come after you. Explained. I\u2019m sorry.</p><p>I haven\u2019t exactly been trusting since everything that happened with my brother, and honestly I was scared that you\u2019d just tell me to go to hell.\u201d</p><p>I sighed. \u201cI should have let you explain. Running out like that...it wasn\u2019t exactly the mature thing to do.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sadness crisscrossed his features, but hope was there, too\u2014just under the surface. It broke my heart. I closed the distance between us and wrapped my arms around him, pulling him into a hug.</p><p>He stepped closer and buried his face in my hair, his arms so tight around me I squeaked. He loosened his hold and looked at me, then moved a bit of my hair from my face, tucking it behind my ear. I smiled at him, and the tension drained from his features and the muscles under my hands. It felt so good to be in his arms again.</p><p>\u201cI missed you,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d I whispered. He lowered his mouth to mine and kissed me gently, and I pressed myself against him, my body suddenly soft and in great need. Only the knowledge that Elaine was probably listening to us upstairs allowed me to break our kiss. When I pulled back, his intense expression almost made me decide I didn\u2019t care what Elaine did or did not hear. But I gave him a small smile and stepped back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you know, but Koslov didn\u2019t make it,\u201d he said, and I nodded, still unsure exactly how I felt about that.</p><p>\u201cLeon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re saying he died in there, too. The whole warehouse went up, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t sound convinced.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure fire could kill a salamander, even at those temperatures. Well, not most salamanders anyway.</p><p>The OWEA also interviewed some of Leon\u2019s family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently he and Koslov were in a relationship for nearly a year. It ended right around the time Koslov started his succubi experiments.\u201d</p><p>I shuddered. \u201cSo Koslov decided to siphon a succubus\u2019s power for himself, to get back at Leon.\u201d I knew it was true; it fit Leon\u2019s mixture of emotions and the brief flashes of memory I\u2019d gotten from him while thrilling the salamander.</p><p>Costa didn\u2019t ask how I knew that, but worry creased his brow. \u201cSeems like it. And from what we could gather from his staff, Koslov has been growing seriously unstable the last couple of years. Not that the man could have ever been totally right, being willing to do what he did, but it\u2019d been starting to show.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe because he took the power? A power his mind and body weren\u2019t built to handle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d He paused. \u201cHow are you doing?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou drained some energy from Leon, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>I stiffened and headed for the kitchen. Costa trailed behind me. \u201cYes, but not enough to make a lasting connection. I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d That wasn\u2019t entirely true; I could still feel a bit of Leon, and that would never go away. But the presence was small, and so unformed it wasn\u2019t worth mentioning. I knew it would fade\u2014if not disappear\u2014in time. \u201cWant some tea?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He gave me a disgusted look. \u201cCoffee?\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cI guess I could dust off the coffeemaker.\u201d</p><p>He sat down at the kitchen table while I looked for the old tin of coffee I knew I had somewhere. \u201cHow is Elaine?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s better than I expected her to be.\u201d There. An old tin of coffee hid behind a bag of flour. I turned to face Costa and waved the coffee at him. \u201cShe\u2019s already talking about going back to class. I think she\u2019s handling this better than I am, to be honest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo there are no lingering magical effects?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that Natalie could find. She doesn\u2019t think Koslov had long enough to complete the spells.\u201d I looked away from Costa\u2019s intense gaze and focused on my kitchen window. The sun was out, sparkling against the grass. The first sunny day I\u2019d seen in a while. \u201cI talked to Natalie about Koslov.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did she say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently he\u2019s always had a bit of an issue with women. Natalie said that no one realized how deeply disturbed he was. He took Natalie when she started looking into that list of potential suspects for us. Guess he got nervous.\u201d</p><p>I heard footsteps against the tile, and the next thing I knew, Costa stood next to me. \u201cWhere does this leave us, Mari?\u201d</p><p>I turned to face him, and his expression was open, full of emotions I couldn\u2019t name, and something in my heart twisted. But I didn\u2019t know what to say. I cared about him\u2014 far too much considering our short time together and the mobile nature of his job\u2014but there it was.</p><p>He leaned in, and murmured against my ear, \u201cI\u2019m falling in love with you, bella. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll crash and burn without you.\u201d</p><p>I grinned. \u201cWell, I certainly wouldn\u2019t want you to burn.\u201d</p><p>This time, when he kissed me, I had a hard time letting him go. </p> </body></html>"]
