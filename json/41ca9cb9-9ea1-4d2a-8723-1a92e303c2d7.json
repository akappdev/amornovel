It\u2019s for their own good. I mean, take my own parents. If they knew the unvarnished truth about my finances/love life/plumbing/council tax, they\u2019d have instant heart attacks and the doctor would say, \u201cDid anyone give them a terrible shock?\u201d and it would all be my fault. Therefore, they have been in my flat for approximately ten minutes and already I have told them the following lies:</p><p>1. L &amp;N Executive Recruitment will start making profits soon, I\u2019m sure of it.</p><p>2. Natalie is a fantastic business partner, and it was a really brilliant idea to chuck in my job to become a headhunter with her.</p> <p>3. Of course I don\u2019t just exist on pizza, black cherry yogurts, and vodka.</p><p>4. Yes, I did know about interest on parking tickets.</p><p>5. Yes, I did watch that Charles Dickens DVD they gave me for Christmas; it was great, especially that lady in the bonnet. Yes, Peggotty. That\u2019s who I meant.</p><p>6. I was actually intending to buy a smoke alarm at the weekend, what a coincidence they should mention it.</p><p>7. Yes, it\u2019ll be nice to see all the family again.</p> <p>Seven lies. Not including all the ones about Mum\u2019s outfit. And we haven\u2019t even mentioned The Subject.</p><p>As I come out of my bedroom in a black dress and hastily applied mascara, I see Mum looking at my overdue phone bill on the mantelpiece.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d I say quickly. \u201cI\u2019m going to sort that out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly, if you don\u2019t,\u201d says Mum, \u201cthey\u2019ll cut off your line, and it\u2019ll take ages for you to get it installed again, and the mobile signal is so patchy here. What if there was an emergency? What would you do?\u201d Her brow is creased with anxiety. She looks as though this is all totally imminent, as though there\u2019s a woman screaming in labor in the bedroom and floods are rising outside the window and how will we contact the helicopter? How?</p><p>\u201cEr... I hadn\u2019t thought about it. Mum, I\u2019ll pay the bill. Honest.\u201d</p><p>Mum\u2019s always been a worrier. She gets this tense smile with distant, frightened eyes, and you just know she\u2019s playing out some apocalyptic scenario in her head. She looked like that throughout my last speech day at school; afterward she confessed she\u2019d suddenly noticed a chandelier hanging above on a rickety chain and became obsessed by what would happen if it fell down on the girls\u2019 heads and splintered into smithereens?</p> <p>Now she tugs at her black suit, which has shoulder pads and weird metal buttons and is swamping her. I vaguely remember it from about ten years ago, when she had a phase of going on job interviews and I had to teach her all the really basic computer stuff like how to use a mouse. She ended up working for a children\u2019s charity, which doesn\u2019t have a formal dress code, thank goodness.</p><p>No one in my family looks good in black. Dad\u2019s wearing a suit made out of a dull black fabric which flattens all his features. He\u2019s actually quite handsome, my dad, in a kind of fine-boned, understated way. His hair is brown and wispy, whereas Mum\u2019s is fair and wispy like mine. They both look really great when they\u2019re relaxed and on their own territory-like, say, when we\u2019re all in Cornwall on Dad\u2019s rickety old boat, wearing fleeces and eating pasties. Or when Mum and Dad are playing in their local amateur orchestra, which is where they first met. But today, nobody\u2019s relaxed.</p><p>\u201cSo are you ready?\u201d Mum glances at my stockinged feet. \u201cWhere are your shoes, darling?\u201d</p><p>I slump down on the sofa. \u201cDo I have to go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLara!\u201d says Mum chidingly. \u201cShe was your great-aunt. She was one hundred and five, you know.\u201d</p><p>Mum has told me my great-aunt was 105 approximately 105 times. I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s because that\u2019s the only fact she knows about her.</p><p>\u201cSo what? I didn\u2019t know her. None of us knew her. This is so stupid. Why are we schlepping to Potters Bar for some crumbly old woman we didn\u2019t even ever meet?\u201d I hunch my shoulders up, feeling more like a sulky three-year-old than a mature twenty-seven-year-old with her own business.</p><p>\u201cUncle Bill and the others are going,\u201d says Dad. \u201cAnd if they can make the effort...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a family occasion!\u201d puts in Mum brightly.</p><p>My shoulders hunch even harder. I\u2019m allergic to family occasions. Sometimes I think we\u2019d do better as dandelion seeds-no family, no history, just floating off into the world, each on our own piece of fluff.</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t take long,\u201d Mum says coaxingly</p><p>\u201cIt will.\u201d I stare at the carpet. \u201cAnd everyone will ask me about... things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, they won\u2019t!\u201d says Mum at once, glancing at Dad for backup. \u201cNo one will even mention... things.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There\u2019s silence. The Subject is hovering in the air. It\u2019s as though we\u2019re all avoiding looking at it. At last Dad plunges in.</p><p>\u201cSo! Speaking of... things.\u201d He hesitates. \u201cAre you generally... OK?\u201d</p><p>I can see Mum listening on super-high-alert, even though she\u2019s pretending to be concentrating on combing her hair.</p><p>\u201cOh, you know,\u201d I say after a pause. \u201cI\u2019m fine. I mean, you can\u2019t expect me just to snap back into-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not!\u201d Dad immediately backs off. Then he tries again. \u201cBut you\u2019re... in good spirits?\u201d</p><p>I nod assent.</p><p>\u201cGood!\u201d says Mum, looking relieved. \u201cI knew you\u2019d get over... things.\u201d</p><p>My parents don\u2019t say \u201cJosh\u201d out loud anymore, because of the way I used to dissolve into heaving sobs whenever I heard his name. For a while, Mum referred to him as \u201cHe Who Must Not Be Named.\u201d Now he\u2019s just \u201cThings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you haven\u2019t... been in touch with him?\u201d Dad is looking anywhere but at me, and Mum appears engrossed in her handbag.</p><p>That\u2019s another euphemism. What he means is, \u201cHave you sent him any more obsessive texts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say, flushing. \u201cI haven\u2019t, OK?\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s so unfair of him to bring that up. In fact, the whole thing was totally blown out of proportion. I only sent Josh a few texts. Three a day, if that. Hardly any. And they weren\u2019t obsessive. They were just me being honest and open, which, by the way, you\u2019re supposed to be in a relationship.</p><p>I mean, you can\u2019t just switch off your feelings because the other person did, can you? You can\u2019t just say, \u201cOh right! So your plan is, we never see each other again, never make love again, never talk or communicate in any way. Fab idea, Josh, why didn\u2019t I think of that?\u201d</p><p>So what happens is, you write your true feelings down in a text simply because you want to share them, and next minute your ex-boyfriend changes his phone number and tells your parents. He\u2019s such a sneak.</p><p>\u201cLara, I know you were very hurt, and this has been a painful time for you.\u201d Dad clears his throat. \u201cBut it\u2019s been nearly two months now. You\u2019ve got to move on, darling. See other young men... go out and enjoy yourself...\u201d</p><p>Oh God, I can\u2019t face another of Dad\u2019s lectures about how plenty of men are going to fall at the feet of a beauty like me. I mean, for a start, there aren\u2019t any men in the world, everyone knows that. And a five-foot-three girl with a snubby nose and no suntan isn\u2019t exactly a beauty.</p><p>OK. I know I look all right sometimes. I have a heart-shaped face, wide-set green eyes, and a few freckles over my nose. And to top it off, I have this little bee-stung mouth which no one else in my family has. But take it from me, I\u2019m no supermodel.</p><p>\u201cSo, is that what you did when you and Mum broke up that time in Polzeath? Go out and see other people?\u201d I can\u2019t help throwing it out, even though this is going over old ground. Dad sighs and exchanges glances with Mum.</p><p>\u201cWe should never have told her about that,\u201d she murmurs, rubbing her brow. \u201cWe should never have mentioned it-\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause if you\u2019d done that,\u201d I continue inexorably, \u201cyou would never have got back together again, would you? Dad would never have said that he was the bow to your violin and you would never have got married.\u201d</p><p>This line about the bow and the violin has made it into family lore. I\u2019ve heard the story a zillion times. Dad arrived at Mum\u2019s house, all sweaty because he\u2019d been riding on his bike, and she\u2019d been crying but she pretended she had a cold, and they made up their fight and Granny gave them tea and shortbread. (I don\u2019t know why the shortbread is relevant, but it always gets mentioned.)</p><p>\u201cLara, darling.\u201d Mum sighs. \u201cThat was very different; we\u2019d been together three years, we were engaged-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know!\u201d I say defensively. \u201cI know it was different. I\u2019m just saying, people do sometimes get back together. It does happen.\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s silence.</p><p>\u201cLara, you\u2019ve always been a romantic soul-\u201d begins Dad.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not romantic!\u201d I exclaim, as though this is a deadly insult. I\u2019m staring at the carpet, rubbing the pile with my toe, but in my peripheral vision I can see Mum and Dad, each mouthing vigorously at the other to speak next. Mum\u2019s shaking her head and pointing at Dad as though to say, \u201cYou go!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you break up with someone,\u201d Dad starts again in an awkward rush, \u201cit\u2019s easy to look backward and think life would be perfect if you got back together. But-\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He\u2019s going to tell me how life is an escalator. I have to head him off, quick.</p><p>\u201cDad. Listen. Please.\u201d Somehow I muster my calmest tones. \u201cYou\u2019ve got it all wrong. I don\u2019t want to get back together with Josh.\u201d I try to sound as if this is a ridiculous idea. \u201cThat\u2019s not why I texted him. I just wanted closure . I mean, he broke things off with no warning, no talking, no discussion. I never got any answers. It\u2019s like... unfinished business. It\u2019s like reading an Agatha Christie and never knowing whodunnit!\u201d</p><p>There. Now they\u2019ll understand.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d says Dad at length, \u201cI can understand your frustrations-\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s all I ever wanted,\u201d I say as convincingly as I can. \u201cTo understand what Josh was thinking. To talk things over. To communicate like two civilized human beings.\u201d</p><p>And to get back together with him , my mind adds, like a silent, truthful arrow. Because I know Josh still loves me, even if no one else thinks so .</p><p>But there\u2019s no point saying that to my parents. They\u2019d never get it. How could they? They have no concept of how amazing Josh and I were as a couple, how we fit together perfectly. They don\u2019t understand how he obviously made a panicked, rushed, boy-type decision, based on some nonexistent reason probably, and how if I could just talk to him, I\u2019m sure I could straighten everything out and we\u2019d be together again.</p><p>Sometimes I feel streets ahead of my parents, just like Einstein must have done when his friends kept saying, \u201cThe universe is straight, Albert, take it from us,\u201d and inside he was secretly thinking, \u201cI know it\u2019s curved. I\u2019ll show you one day.\u201d</p><p>Mum and Dad are surreptitiously mouthing at each other again. I should put them out of their misery.</p> <p>\u201cAnyway, you mustn\u2019t worry about me,\u201d I say hastily. \u201cBecause I have moved on. I mean, OK, maybe I haven\u2019t moved on totally\u201d I amend as I see their dubious expressions, \u201cbut I\u2019ve accepted that Josh doesn\u2019t want to talk. I\u2019ve realized that it just wasn\u2019t meant to be. I\u2019ve learned a lot about myself, and... I\u2019m in a good place. Really.\u201d</p><p>My smile is pasted on my face. I feel like I\u2019m chanting the mantra of some wacky cult. I should be wearing robes and banging a tambourine.</p><p>Hare hare... I\u2019ve moved on... hare hare... I\u2019m in a good place... .</p><p>Dad and Mum exchange looks. I have no idea whether they believe me, but at least I\u2019ve given us all a way out of this sticky conversation.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the spirit!\u201d Dad says, looking relieved. \u201cWell done, Lara, I knew you\u2019d get there. And you\u2019ve got the business with Natalie to focus on, which is obviously going tremendously well...\u201d</p><p>My smile becomes even more cultlike.</p> <p>\u201cAbsolutely!\u201d</p><p>Hare hare... my business is going well... hare hare... it\u2019s not a disaster at all...</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019ve come through this.\u201d Mum comes over and kisses the top of my head. \u201cNow, we\u2019d better get going. Find yourself some black shoes, chop chop!\u201d</p><p>With a resentful sigh I get to my feet and drag myself into my bedroom. It\u2019s a beautiful sunshiny day. And I get to spend it at a hideous family occasion involving a dead 105-year-old person. Sometimes life really sucks.</p><p>As we pull up in the drab little car park of the Potters Bar Funeral Center, I notice a small crowd of people outside a side door. Then I see the glint of a TV camera and a fluffy microphone bobbing above people\u2019s heads.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d I peer out the car window. \u201cSomething to do with Uncle Bill?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably.\u201d Dad nods.</p><p>\u201cI think someone\u2019s doing a documentary about him,\u201d Mum puts in. \u201cTrudy mentioned it. For his book.\u201d</p> <p>This is what happens when one of your relations is a celebrity. You get used to TV cameras being around. And people saying, when you introduce yourself, \u201cLington? Any relation to Lingtons Coffee, ha ha?\u201d and them being gobsmacked when you say, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>My uncle Bill is the Bill Lington, who started Lingtons Coffee from nothing at the age of twenty-six and built it up into a worldwide empire of coffee shops. His face is printed on every single coffee cup, which makes him more famous than the Beatles or something. You\u2019d recognize him if you saw him. And right now he\u2019s even more high profile than usual because his autobiography, Two Little Coins , came out last month and is a bestseller. Apparently Pierce Brosnan might play him in the movie.</p><p>Of course, I\u2019ve read it from cover to cover. It\u2019s all about how he was down to his last twenty pence and bought a coffee and it tasted so terrible it gave him the idea to run coffee shops. So he opened one and started a chain, and now he pretty much owns the world. His nickname is \u201cThe Alchemist,\u201d and according to some article last year, the entire business world would like to know the secrets of his success. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>That\u2019s why he started his Two Little Coins seminars. I secretly went to one a few months ago. Just in case I could get some tips on running a brand-new business. There were two hundred people there, all lapping up every word, and at the end we had to hold two coins up in the air and say, \u201cThis is my beginning.\u201d It was totally cheesy and embarrassing, but everyone around me seemed really inspired. Personally speaking, I was listening hard all the way through and I still don\u2019t know how he did it.</p><p>I mean, he was twenty-six when he made his first million. Twenty-six! He just started a business and became an instant success. Whereas I started a business six months ago and all I\u2019ve become is an instant head case.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you and Natalie will write a book about your business one day!\u201d says Mum, as though she can read my mind.</p><p>\u201cGlobal domination is just around the corner,\u201d chimes in Dad heartily.</p> <p>\u201cLook, a squirrel!\u201d I point hastily out the window. My parents have been so supportive of my business, I can\u2019t tell them the truth. So I just change the subject whenever they mention it.</p><p>To be strictly accurate, you could say Mum wasn\u2019t instantly supportive. In fact, you could say that when I first announced I was giving up my marketing job and taking out all my savings to start a headhunting company, having never been a headhunter in my life or knowing anything about it, she went into total meltdown.</p><p>But she calmed down when I explained I was going into partnership with my best friend, Natalie. And that Natalie was a top executive headhunter and would be fronting the business at first while I did the admin and marketing and learned the skills of headhunting myself. And that we already had several contracts lined up and would pay off the bank loan in no time.</p><p>It all sounded like such a brilliant plan. It was a brilliant plan. Until a month ago, when Natalie went on holiday, fell in love with a Goan beach bum, and texted me a week later to say she didn\u2019t know exactly when she\u2019d be coming back, but the details of everything were in the computer and I\u2019d be fine and the surf was fabulous out here, I should really visit, big kisses, Natalie xxxxx.</p><p>I am never going into business with Natalie again. Ever.</p> <p>\u201cNow, is this off?\u201d Mum is jabbing uncertainly at her mobile phone. \u201cI can\u2019t have it ringing during the service.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s have a look.\u201d Dad pulls in to a parking space, turns off the engine, and takes it. \u201cYou want to put it on silent mode.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d says Mum in alarm. \u201cI want it off! The silent mode may malfunction!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere we are, then.\u201d Dad presses the side button. \u201cAll off.\u201d He hands it back to Mum, who eyes it anxiously.</p><p>\u201cBut what if it somehow turns itself back on while it\u2019s in my bag?\u201d She looks pleadingly at both of us. \u201cThat happened to Mary at the boat club, you know. The thing just came alive in her handbag and rang, while she was doing jury duty. They said she must have bumped it, or touched it somehow...\u201d</p><p>Her voice is rising and becoming breathless. This is where my sister, Tonya, would lose patience and snap, \u201cDon\u2019t be so stupid, Mum, of course your phone won\u2019t turn itself on!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMum.\u201d I take it gently from her. \u201cHow about we leave it in the car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She relaxes a little. \u201cYes, that\u2019s a good idea. I\u2019ll put it in the glove compartment.\u201d</p><p>I glance at Dad, who gives me a tiny smile. Poor Mum. All this ridiculous stuff going on in her head. She really needs to get things in proportion.</p><p>As we approach the funeral center, I hear Uncle Bill\u2019s distinctive drawl carrying on the air, and sure enough, as we make our way through the little crowd, there he is, with his leather jacket and permatan and springy hair. Everyone knows Uncle Bill is obsessed about his hair. It\u2019s thick and luxuriant and jet black, and if any newspaper ever suggests that he dyes it, he threatens to sue them.</p><p>\u201cFamily\u2019s the most important thing,\u201d he\u2019s saying to an interviewer in jeans. \u201cFamily is the rock we all stand on. If I have to interrupt my schedule for a funeral, then so be it.\u201d I can see the admiration pass through the crowd. One girl, who\u2019s holding a Lingtons takeaway cup, is clearly beside herself and keeps whispering to her friend, \u201cIt\u2019s really him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we could leave it there for now...\u201d One of Uncle Bill\u2019s assistants approaches the cameraman. \u201cBill has to go into the funeral home. Thanks, guys. Just a few autographs...\u201d he adds to the crowd.</p><p>We wait patiently at the side until everyone has got Uncle Bill to scribble on their coffee cups and funeral programs with a Sharpie, while the camera films them. Then, at last, they melt away and Uncle Bill heads over our way. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHi, Michael.

How are you doing? Congratulations on your book.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for the signed copy!\u201d puts in Mum brightly.</p> <p>Bill nods briefly at all of us, then says straight into the phone, \u201cSteve, I got your email.\u201d Mum and Dad exchange glances. Obviously that\u2019s the end of our big family catch-up.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s find out where we\u2019re supposed to be going,\u201d murmurs Mum to Dad. \u201cLara, are you coming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I\u2019ll stay out here for a moment,\u201d I say on impulse. \u201cSee you inside!\u201d</p><p>I wait until my parents have disappeared, then edge closer to Uncle Bill. I\u2019ve suddenly hatched a demon plan. At his seminar, Uncle Bill said the key to success for any entrepreneur was grabbing every opportunity. Well, I\u2019m an entrepreneur, aren\u2019t I? And this is an opportunity, isn\u2019t it?</p><p>When he seems to have finished his conversation, I say hesitantly, \u201cHi, Uncle Bill. Could I talk to you for a moment?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWait.\u201d He lifts a hand and puts his BlackBerry to his ear. \u201cHi, Paulo. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>His eyes swivel to me and he beckons, which I guess is my cue to speak.</p><p>\u201cDid you know I\u2019m a headhunter now?\u201d I give a nervous smile. \u201cI\u2019ve gone into partnership with a friend. We\u2019re called L &amp;N Executive Recruitment. Could I tell you about our business?\u201d</p><p>Uncle Bill frowns at me thoughtfully for a moment, then says, \u201cHold on, Paulo.\u201d</p><p>Oh wow! He\u2019s put his phone call on hold! For me!</p><p>\u201cWe specialize in finding highly qualified, motivated individuals for senior executive positions,\u201d I say, trying not to gabble. \u201cI wondered if maybe I could talk with someone in your HR department, explain our services, maybe put a pitch together-\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLara.\u201d Uncle Bill lifts a hand to stop me. \u201cWhat would you say if I put you in touch with my head of recruitment and told her: \u2018This is my niece, give her a chance?\u2019\u201d</p><p>I feel an explosion of delight. I want to sing \u201cHallelujah.\u201d My gamble paid off!</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say thank you very much, Uncle Bill!\u201d I manage, trying to stay calm. \u201cI\u2019d do the best job I could, I\u2019d work 24/7, I\u2019d be so grateful-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he interrupts. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t. You wouldn\u2019t respect yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWh-what?\u201d I stop in confusion.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m saying no.\u201d He shoots me a dazzling white smile. \u201cI\u2019m doing you a favor, Lara. If you make it on your own, you\u2019ll feel so much better. You\u2019ll feel you\u2019ve earned it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d I swallow, my face burning with humiliation. \u201cI mean, I do want to earn it. I do want to work hard. I just thought maybe...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I can come from two little coins, Lara, so can you.\u201d He holds my gaze for a moment. \u201cBelieve in yourself. Believe in your dream. Here.\u201d</p> <p>Oh no. Please no. He\u2019s reached in his pocket and is now holding out two ten-pence pieces to me.</p><p>\u201cThese are your two little coins.\u201d He gives me a deep, earnest look, the same way he does on the TV ad. \u201cLara, close your eyes. Feel it. Believe it. Say, \u2018This is my beginning.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is my beginning,\u201d I mumble, cringing all over. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Uncle Bill nods, then turns back to the phone. \u201cPaulo. Sorry about that.\u201d</p><p>Hot with embarrassment, I edge away. So much for grabbing opportunities. So much for contacts. I just want to get through this stupid funeral and go home.</p><p>I head around the building and through the front glass doors of the funeral center to find myself in a foyer with upholstered chairs and posters of doves and a subdued air. There\u2019s no one about, not even at the reception desk.</p><p>Suddenly I hear singing coming from behind a pale wood door. Shit. It\u2019s started. I\u2019m missing it. I hurriedly push the door open-and, sure enough, there are rows of benches filled with people. The room is so crowded that, as I edge in, the people standing at the back have to jostle to one side, and I find myself a space as unobtrusively as possible.</p><p>As I look around, trying to spot Mum and Dad, I\u2019m overwhelmed by the sheer number of people here. And the flowers. All down the sides of the room there are gorgeous arrangements in shades of white and cream. A woman at the front is singing Pie Jesu , but there are so many people in front of me, I can\u2019t see. Near me, a couple of people are sniffing, and one girl has tears streaming openly down her face. I feel a bit chastened. All these people, here for my great-aunt, and I never even knew her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I didn\u2019t even send any flowers, I realize in sudden mortification. Should I have written a card or something? God, I hope Mum and Dad sorted it all out.</p><p>The music is so lovely and the atmosphere is so emotional that suddenly I can\u2019t help it, I feel my eyes pricking too. Next to me is an old lady in a black velvet hat, who notices and clicks her tongue sympathetically.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a handkerchief, dear?\u201d she whispers.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I admit, and she immediately snaps open her large, old-fashioned patent bag. A smell of camphor rises up, and inside I glimpse several pairs of spectacles, a box of mints, a packet of hairpins, a box labeled String, and half a packet of digestive biscuits.</p> <p>\u201cYou should always bring a handkerchief to a funeral.\u201d She offers me a packet of tissues.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I gulp, taking one. \u201cThat\u2019s really kind. I\u2019m the great-niece, by the way.\u201d</p><p>She nods sympathetically. \u201cThis must be a terrible time for you. How\u2019s the family coping?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr... well...\u201d I fold up the tissue, wondering how to answer. I can\u2019t exactly say \u201cNo one\u2019s that bothered; in fact, Uncle Bill\u2019s still on his BlackBerry outside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe all have to support each other at this time,\u201d I improvise at last.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d The old lady nods gravely as though I\u2019ve said something really wise, as opposed to straight off a Hallmark card. \u201cWe all have to support each other.\u201d She clasps my hand. \u201cI\u2019d be glad to talk, dear, anytime you want to. It\u2019s an honor to meet any relative of Bert\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you-\u201d I begin automatically, then halt.</p><p>Bert?</p><p>I\u2019m sure my aunt wasn\u2019t called Bert. In fact, I know she wasn\u2019t. She was called Sadie.</p><p>\u201cYou know, you look a lot like him.\u201d The woman\u2019s surveying my face.</p><p>Shit. I\u2019m in the wrong funeral.</p> <p>\u201cSomething about the forehead. And you have his nose. Did anyone ever tell you that, dear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm... sometimes!\u201d I say wildly. \u201cActually, I\u2019ve just got to... er... Thanks so much for the tissue...\u201d I hastily start making my way back toward the door.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Bert\u2019s great-niece.\u201d I can hear the old lady\u2019s voice following me. \u201cShe\u2019s very upset, poor thing.\u201d</p><p>I practically throw myself at the pale wooden door and find myself in the foyer again, almost landing on Mum and Dad. They\u2019re standing with a woman with woolly gray hair, a dark suit, and a stack of leaflets in her hand.</p><p>\u201cLara! Where were you?\u201d Mum looks in puzzlement at the door. \u201cWhat were you doing in there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you in Mr. Cox\u2019s funeral?\u201d The gray-haired woman looks taken aback.</p><p>\u201cI got lost!\u201d I say defensively. \u201cI didn\u2019t know where to go! You should put signs on the doors!\u201d</p><p>Silently, the woman raises her hand and points at a plastic-lettered sign above the door: BERTRAM COX-1:30 P.M. Damn. Why didn\u2019t I notice that?</p> <p>\u201cWell, anyway.\u201d I try to regain my dignity. \u201cLet\u2019s go. We need to bag a seat.\u201d</p><p>TWO</p><p>Bag a seat. What a joke. I\u2019ve never been at anything as depressing as this, my whole entire life.</p><p>OK, I know it\u2019s a funeral. It\u2019s not supposed to be a riot. But at least Bert\u2019s funeral had lots of people and flowers and music and atmosphere. At least that other room felt like something.</p><p>This room has nothing. It\u2019s bare and chilly, with just a closed coffin at the front and SADIE LANCASTER in crappy plastic letters on a notice board. No flowers, no lovely smell, no singing, just some Muzak piped out of speakers. And the place is practically empty. Just Mum, Dad, and me on one side; Uncle Bill, Aunt Trudy, and my cousin Diamant\u00e9 on the other.</p><p>I surreptitiously run my gaze over the other side of the family. Even though we\u2019re related, they still seem like a celebrity magazine come to life. Uncle Bill is sprawled on his plastic chair as though he owns the place, typing at his BlackBerry. Aunt Trudy is flicking through Hello! , probably reading about all her friends. She\u2019s wearing a tight black dress, her blond hair is artfully swept around her face, and her cleavage is even more tanned and impressive than last time I saw her. Aunt Trudy married Uncle Bill twenty years ago, and I swear she looks younger today than she does in her wedding pictures.</p><p>Diamant\u00e9\u2019s platinum-blond hair sweeps down to her bum, and she\u2019s wearing a minidress covered with a skull print. Really tasteful for a funeral. She has her iPod plugged in and is texting on her mobile and keeps looking at her watch with a sulky scowl. Diamant\u00e9 is seventeen and has two cars and her own fashion label called Tutus and Pearls, which Uncle Bill set up for her. (I looked at it online once. The dresses all cost four hundred pounds, and everyone who buys one gets their name on a special \u201cDiamant\u00e9\u2019s Best Friends\u201d list, and half of them are celebs\u2019 kids. It\u2019s like Facebook, but with dresses.) </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHey, Mum,\u201d I say. \u201cHow come there aren\u2019t any flowers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Mum immediately looks anxious. \u201cI spoke to Trudy about flowers, and she said she would do it. Trudy?\u201d she calls over. \u201cWhat happened about the flowers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell!\u201d Trudy closes Hello! and swivels around as though she\u2019s quite up for a chat. \u201cI know we discussed it. But do you know the price of all this?\u201d She gestures around. \u201cAnd we\u2019re sitting here for, what, twenty minutes? You\u2019ve got to be realistic, Pippa. Flowers would be a waste.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose so,\u201d Mum says hesitantly.</p> <p>\u201cI mean, I don\u2019t begrudge the old lady a funeral.\u201d Aunt Trudy leans toward us, lowering her voice. \u201cBut you have to ask yourself, \u2018What did she ever do for us?\u2019 I mean, I didn\u2019t know her. Did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it was difficult.\u201d Mum looks pained. \u201cShe\u2019d had the stroke, she was bewildered a lot of the time-\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly!\u201d Trudy nods. \u201cShe didn\u2019t understand anything. What was the point? It\u2019s only because of Bill that we\u2019re here.\u201d Trudy glances at Uncle Bill fondly. \u201cHe\u2019s too softhearted for his own good. I often say to people-\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrap!\u201d Diamant\u00e9 rips out her earphones and looks at her mother scornfully. \u201cWe\u2019re only here for Dad\u2019s show. He wasn\u2019t planning to come \u2019til the producer said a funeral would \u2018massively up his sympathy quotient.\u2019 I heard them talking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDiamant\u00e9!\u201d exclaims Aunt Trudy crossly.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s true! He\u2019s the biggest hypocrite on earth and so are you. And I\u2019m supposed to be at Hannah\u2019s house right now.\u201d Diamant\u00e9\u2019s cheeks puff out resentfully. \u201cHer dad\u2019s, like, having this big party for his new movie and I\u2019m missing it. Just so Dad can look all \u2018family\u2019 and \u2018caring.\u2019 It\u2019s so unfair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDiamant\u00e9!\u201d says Trudy tartly. \u201cIt\u2019s your father who paid for you and Hannah to go to Barbados, remember? And that boob job you keep talking about-who\u2019s paying for that, do you think?\u201d</p><p>Diamant\u00e9 draws in breath as though mortally offended. \u201cThat is so unfair. My boob job\u2019s for charity.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help leaning forward with interest. \u201cHow can a boob job be for charity?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to do a magazine interview about it afterward and give the proceeds to charity,\u201d she says proudly. \u201cLike, half the proceeds or something?\u201d</p><p>I glance at Mum. She looks so speechless with shock, I almost burst into giggles.</p> <p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>We all look up to see a woman in gray trousers and a clerical collar, heading up the aisle toward us.</p><p>\u201cMany apologies,\u201d she says, spreading her hands. \u201cI hope you haven\u2019t been waiting too long.\u201d She has cropped salt-and-pepper hair, dark-rimmed glasses, and a deep, almost masculine voice. \u201cMy condolences on your loss.\u201d She glances at the bare coffin. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you were informed, but it\u2019s normal to put up photographs of your loved one...\u201d</p><p>We all exchange blank, awkward looks. Then Aunt Trudy gives a sudden click of the tongue.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a photo. The nursing home sent it on.\u201d</p><p>She rummages in her bag and produces a brown envelope, out of which she draws a battered-looking Polaroid. As she passes it over, I take a look. It shows a tiny, wrinkled old lady hunched over in a chair, wearing a shapeless pale-mauve cardigan. Her face is folded over in a million lines. Her white hair is a translucent puff of candy floss. Her eyes are opaque, as though she can\u2019t even see the world.</p><p>So that was my great-aunt Sadie. And I never even met her.</p><p>The vicar looks at the print dubiously, then pins it onto a big notice board, where it looks totally sad and embarrassing all on its own.</p> <p>\u201cWould any of you like to speak about the deceased?\u201d</p><p>Mutely, we all shake our heads.</p><p>\u201cI understand. It can often be too painful for close family.\u201d The vicar produces a notebook and pencil from her pocket. \u201cIn which case I\u2019ll be glad to speak on your behalf. If you could perhaps just give me some details. Incidents from her life. Tell me everything about Sadie that we should be celebrating.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s silence.</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t really know her,\u201d Dad says apologetically. \u201cShe was very old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne hundred and five,\u201d Mum puts in. \u201cShe was one hundred and five.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas she ever married?\u201d the vicar prompts.</p><p>\u201cEr...\u201d Dad\u2019s brow is wrinkled. \u201cWas there a husband, Bill?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDunno.

Maybe she liked knitting.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid you never visit her?\u201d The vicar is clearly forcing herself to stay polite.</p><p>\u201cOf course we did!\u201d says Mum defensively. \u201cWe popped in to see her in...\u201d She thinks. \u201cIn 1982, I think it was. Lara was a baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201c 1982? \u201d The vicar looks scandalized.</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t know us,\u201d puts in Dad quickly. \u201cShe really wasn\u2019t all there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about from earlier in her life?\u201d The vicar\u2019s voice sounds slightly outraged. \u201cNo achievements? Stories from her youth?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJeez, you don\u2019t give up, do you?\u201d Diamant\u00e9 rips her iPod speakers out of her ears. \u201cCan\u2019t you tell we\u2019re only here because we have to be? She didn\u2019t do anything special. She didn\u2019t achieve anything. She was nobody! Just some million-year-old nobody.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDiamant\u00e9!\u201d says Aunt Trudy in mild reproof. \u201cThat\u2019s not very nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true, though, isn\u2019t it? I mean, look!\u201d She gestures scornfully around the empty room. \u201cIf only six people came to my funeral, I\u2019d shoot myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYoung lady.\u201d The vicar takes a few steps forward, her face flushing with anger. \u201cNo human on God\u2019s earth is a nobody.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, whatever,\u201d says Diamant\u00e9 rudely, and I can see the vicar opening her mouth to make another retort.</p><p>\u201cDiamant\u00e9.\u201d Uncle Bill lifts a hand quickly. \u201cEnough. Obviously I myself regret not visiting Sadie, who I\u2019m sure was a very special person, and I\u2019m sure I speak for all of us.\u201d He\u2019s so charming, I can see the vicar\u2019s ruffled feathers being smoothed. \u201cBut now what we\u2019d like to do is send her off with dignity. I expect you have a tight schedule, as do we.\u201d He taps his watch.</p> <p>\u201cIndeed,\u201d says the vicar after a pause. \u201cI\u2019ll just prepare. In the meantime, please switch off your mobile phones.\u201d With a last disapproving look around at us all, she heads out again, and Aunt Trudy immediately turns in her seat.</p><p>\u201cWhat a nerve, giving us a guilt trip! We don\u2019t have to be here, you know.\u201d</p><p>The door opens and we all look up-but it\u2019s not the vicar, it\u2019s Tonya. I didn\u2019t know she was coming. This day just got about a hundred percent worse.</p><p>\u201cHave I missed it?\u201d Her pneumatic drill of a voice fills the room as she strides down the aisle. \u201cI just managed to scoot away from Toddler Gym before the twins had a meltdown. Honestly, this au pair is worse than the last one, and that\u2019s saying something...\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s wearing black trousers and a black cardigan trimmed with leopard print, her thick highlighted hair pulled back in a ponytail. Tonya used to be an office manager at Shell and boss people around all day. Now she\u2019s a full-time mum of twin boys, Lorcan and Declan, and bosses her poor au pairs around instead.</p><p>\u201cHow are the boys?\u201d asks Mum, but Tonya doesn\u2019t notice. She\u2019s totally focused on Uncle Bill.</p><p>\u201cUncle Bill, I read your book! It was amazing! It changed my life. I\u2019ve told everyone about it. And the photo is wonderful, although it doesn\u2019t do you justice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, sweetheart.\u201d Bill shoots her his standard yes-I-know-I\u2019m-brilliant smile, but she doesn\u2019t seem to notice.</p> <p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it a fantastic book?\u201d She appeals around to the rest of us. \u201cIsn\u2019t Uncle Bill a genius? To start with absolutely nothing! Just two coins and a big dream! It\u2019s so inspiring for humanity!\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s such a suck-up, I want to hurl. Mum and Dad obviously feel the same way, as neither of them answers. Uncle Bill isn\u2019t paying her any attention either. Reluctantly, she swivels around on her heel.</p><p>\u201cHow are you, Lara? I\u2019ve hardly seen you lately! You\u2019ve been hiding!\u201d Her eyes start focusing in on me with intent as she comes nearer and I shrink away. Uh-oh. I know that look.</p><p>My sister, Tonya, basically has three facial expressions:</p><p>1) Totally blank and bovine.</p><p>2) Loud, showy-offy laughter, as in \u201cUncle Bill, you kill me!\u201d</p><p>3) Gloating delight masked as sympathy as she picks away at someone else\u2019s misery. She\u2019s addicted to the Real Life channel and books with tragic, scruffy kids on the cover, called things like Please, Grammy, Don\u2019t Hit Me with the Mangle . </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen you since you split up with Josh.

So, was there someone else?\u201d Her eyes swivel back to me.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you getting on OK?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why?\u201d She folds her arms, looking baffled and almost accusing. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know why! I want to scream. Don\u2019t you think I\u2019ve asked myself that question a bazillion times?</p><p>\u201cIt was just one of those things!\u201d I force a smile. \u201cI\u2019m fine about it. I\u2019ve realized that it wasn\u2019t meant to be, and I\u2019ve moved on and I\u2019m in a good place. I\u2019m really happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t look happy.\u201d Diamant\u00e9 observes from across the aisle. \u201cDoes she, Mum?\u201d</p><p>Aunt Trudy surveys me for a few moments.</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d she says at last, in definitive tones. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t look happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I am!\u201d I can feel tears stinging my eyes. \u201cI\u2019m just hiding it! I\u2019m really, really, really happy!\u201d</p><p>God, I hate all my relatives.</p><p>\u201cTonya, darling, sit down,\u201d Mum says tactfully. \u201cHow did the school visit go?\u201d</p><p>Blinking hard, I get out my phone and pretend to be checking my messages so no one bothers me. Then, before I can stop it, my finger scrolls down to photos.</p><p>Don\u2019t look , I tell myself firmly. Do not look .</p><p>But my fingers won\u2019t obey me. It\u2019s an overwhelming compulsion. I have to have one quick look, just to keep me going... my fingers are scrabbling as I summon up my favorite picture. Josh and me. Standing together on a mountain slope, arms around each other, both with ski tans. Josh\u2019s fair hair is curling over the goggles thrust up on his head. He\u2019s smiling at me with that perfect dimple in his cheek, that dimple I used to push my finger into, like a toddler with Play-Doh.</p><p>We first met at a Guy Fawkes party, standing around a fire in a garden in Clapham that belonged to a girl I knew at university. Josh was handing out sparklers to everyone. He lit one for me and asked me what my name was and wrote Lara in the darkness with his sparkler, and I laughed and asked his name. We wrote each other\u2019s names in the air until the sparklers went dead, then edged closer to the fire and sipped mulled wine and reminisced about fireworks parties of our childhoods. Everything we said chimed. We laughed at the same things. I\u2019d never met anyone so easygoing. Or with such a cute smile. I can\u2019t imagine him being with anyone else. I just can\u2019t...</p> <p>\u201cAll right, Lara?\u201d Dad is glancing over at me.</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d I say brightly, and jab off the phone before he can see the screen. As organ Muzak begins, I sink back in my chair, consumed with misery. I should never have come today. I should have made up an excuse. I hate my family and I hate funerals and there isn\u2019t even any good coffee and-</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s my necklace?\u201d A girl\u2019s distant voice interrupts my thoughts.</p><p>I glance around to see who it is, but there\u2019s no one behind me. Who was that?</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s my necklace?\u201d the faint voice comes again. It\u2019s high and imperious and quite posh-sounding. Is it coming from the phone? Didn\u2019t I turn it off properly? I pull my phone out of my bag-but the screen is dead.</p><p>Weird.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s my necklace?\u201d Now the voice sounds as though it\u2019s right in my ear. I flinch and look all around in bewilderment.</p><p>What\u2019s even weirder is, no one else seems to have noticed.</p><p>\u201cMum.\u201d I lean over. \u201cDid you hear something just now? Like... a voice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA voice?\u201d Mum looks puzzled. \u201cNo, darling. What kind of voice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a girl\u2019s voice, just a moment ago...\u201d I stop as I see a familiar look of anxiety coming over Mum\u2019s face. I can almost see her thoughts, in a bubble: Dear God, my daughter\u2019s hearing voices in her head . </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI must have misheard,\u201d I say hastily, and thrust my phone away, just as the vicar appears.</p><p>\u201cPlease rise,\u201d she intones. \u201cAnd let us all bow our heads. Dear Lord, we commend to you the soul of our sister, Sadie...\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not being prejudiced, but this vicar has the most monotonous voice in the existence of mankind. We\u2019re five minutes in and I\u2019ve already given up trying to pay attention. It\u2019s like school assembly; your mind just goes numb. I lean back and stare up at the ceiling and tune out. I\u2019m just letting my eyelids close when I hear the voice again, right in my ear.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s my necklace?\u201d</p> <p>That made me jump. I swivel my head around from side to side-but, again, there\u2019s nothing. What\u2019s wrong with me?</p><p>\u201cLara!\u201d Mum whispers in alarm. \u201cAre you OK?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve just got a bit of a headache,\u201d I hiss back. \u201cI might go and sit by the window. Get some air.\u201d</p><p>Gesturing apologetically, I get up and head to a chair near the back of the room. The vicar barely notices; she\u2019s too engrossed in her speech.</p><p>\u201cThe end of life is the beginning of life... for as we came from earth, so we return to earth...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhere\u2019s my necklace? I need it.\u201d</p><p>Sharply, I turn my head from side to side, hoping to catch the voice this time. And then suddenly I see it. A hand.</p><p>A slim, manicured hand, resting on the chair back in front of me.</p><p>I move my eyes along, incredulously. The hand belongs to a long, pale, sinuous arm. Which belongs to a girl about my age. Who\u2019s lounging on a chair in front of me, her fingers drumming impatiently. She has dark bobbed hair and a silky sleeveless pale-green dress, and I can just glimpse a pale, jutting chin.</p><p>I\u2019m too astonished to do anything except gape.</p><p>Who the hell is that?</p> <p>As I watch, she swings herself off her chair as though she can\u2019t bear to sit still and starts to pace up and down. Her dress falls straight to the knee, with little pleats at the bottom, which swish about as she walks.</p><p>\u201cI need it,\u201d she\u2019s muttering in agitation. \u201cWhere is it? Where is it?\u201d</p><p>Her voice has a clipped, pinched accent, just like in old-fashioned black-and-white films. I glance wildly over at the rest of my family-but no one else has noticed her. No one has even heard her voice. Everyone else is sitting quietly.</p><p>Suddenly, as though she senses my gaze on her, the girl wheels around and fixes her eyes on mine. They\u2019re so dark and glittering, I can\u2019t tell what color they are, but they widen incredulously as I stare back.</p><p>OK. I\u2019m starting to panic here. I\u2019m having a hallucination. A full-on, walking, talking hallucination. And it\u2019s coming toward me.</p><p>\u201cYou can see me.\u201d She points a white finger at me, and I shrink back in my seat. \u201cYou can see me!\u201d</p><p>I shake my head quickly. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you can hear me!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m aware of Mum at the front of the room, turning to frown at me. Quickly, I cough and gesture at my chest. When I turn back, the girl has gone. Vanished.</p><p>Thank God for that. I thought I was going crazy. I mean, I know I\u2019ve been stressed out recently, but to have an actual vision-</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d I nearly jump out of my skin as the girl\u2019s voice punctuates my thoughts again. Now suddenly she\u2019s striding down the aisle toward me.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d she demands. \u201cWhere is this? Who are these people?\u201d</p><p>Do not reply to the hallucination , I tell myself firmly. It\u2019ll only encourage it . I swivel my head away, and try to pay attention to the vicar.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d The girl has suddenly appeared right in front of me. \u201cAre you real?\u201d She raises a hand as though to prod my shoulder, and I cringe away, but her hand swishes straight through me and comes out the other side.</p><p>I gasp in shock. The girl stares in bewilderment at her hand, then at me.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you?\u201d she demands. \u201cAre you a dream?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d I can\u2019t help retorting in an indignant undertone. \u201cOf course I\u2019m not a dream! You\u2019re the dream!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a dream!\u201d She sounds equally indignant.</p><p>\u201cWho are you, then?\u201d I can\u2019t help shooting back.</p><p>Immediately I regret it, as Mum and Dad both glance back at me. If I told them I was talking to a hallucination, they\u2019d flip. I\u2019d be incarcerated in the Priory tomorrow.</p><p>The girl juts her chin out. \u201cI\u2019m Sadie. Sadie Lancaster.\u201d</p><p>Sadie...?</p><p>No. No way .</p><p>I can\u2019t quite move. My eyes are flicking madly from the girl in front of me... to the wizened, candy-floss-haired old woman in the Polaroid... and then back again to the girl. I\u2019m hallucinating my dead 105-year-old great-aunt? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The hallucination girl looks fairly freaked out too. She turns and starts looking around the room as though taking it in for the first time. For a dizzying few seconds, she appears and reappears all over the room, examining every corner, every window, like an insect buzzing around a glass tank.</p><p>I\u2019ve never had an imaginary friend. I\u2019ve never taken drugs. What is up with me? I tell myself to ignore the girl, to blank her out, to pay attention to the vicar. But it\u2019s no good; I can\u2019t help following her progress.</p><p>\u201cWhat is this place?\u201d She\u2019s hovering by me now, her eyes narrowing in suspicion. She\u2019s focusing on the coffin at the front. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>Oh God.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s... nothing,\u201d I say hastily. \u201cNothing at all! It\u2019s just... I mean... I wouldn\u2019t look too closely if I were you...\u201d</p><p>Too late. She\u2019s appeared at the coffin, staring down at it. I can see her reading the name SADIE LANCASTER on the plastic notice board. I can see her face jolt in shock. After a few moments she turns toward the vicar, who is still droning on in her monotone:</p><p>\u201cSadie found contentment in marriage, which can be an inspiration to us all...\u201d</p><p>The girl puts her face right up close to the vicar\u2019s and regards her with disdain.</p><p>\u201cYou fool,\u201d she says scathingly.</p> <p>\u201cShe was a woman who lived to a great age,\u201d the vicar carries on, totally oblivious. \u201cI look at this picture\u201d-she gestures at the photo with an understanding smile-\u201cand I see a woman who, despite her infirmity, led a beautiful life. Who found solace in small things. Knitting, for example.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnitting?\u201d the girl echoes incredulously.</p><p>\u201cSo.\u201d The vicar has obviously finished her speech. \u201cLet us all bow our heads for a final moment of silence before we say farewell.\u201d She steps down from the podium, and some organ Muzak begins.</p><p>\u201cWhat happens now?\u201d The girl looks around, suddenly alert. A moment later she\u2019s by my side. \u201cWhat happens now? Tell me! Tell me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, the coffin goes behind that curtain,\u201d I murmur in an undertone. \u201cAnd then... er...\u201d I trail off, consumed by embarrassment. How do I put it tactfully? \u201cWe\u2019re at a crematorium, you see. So that would mean...\u201d I wheel my hands vaguely.</p><p>The girl\u2019s face blanches with shock, and I watch in discomfiture as she starts fading to a weird, pale, translucent state. It almost seems as if she\u2019s fainting-but even more so. For a moment I can almost see right through her. Then, as though making some inner resolution, she comes back.</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d She shakes her head. \u201cThat can\u2019t happen. I need my necklace. I need it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I say helplessly. \u201cNothing I can do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to stop the funeral.\u201d She suddenly looks up, her eyes dark and glittering.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I stare at her. \u201cI can\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can! Tell them to stop!\u201d As I turn away, trying to tune her out, she appears at my other side. \u201cStand up! Say something!\u201d</p><p>Her voice is as insistent and piercing as a toddler\u2019s. I\u2019m frantically ducking my head in all directions, trying to avoid her.</p><p>\u201cStop the funeral! Stop it! I must have my necklace!\u201d She\u2019s an inch away from my face; her fists are banging on my chest. I can\u2019t feel them, but I still flinch. In desperation, I get to my feet and move back a row, knocking over a chair with a clatter.</p><p>\u201cLara, are you all right?\u201d Mum looks back in alarm.</p> <p>\u201cFine,\u201d I manage, trying to ignore the yelling in my ear as I sink down into another seat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll order the car,\u201d Uncle Bill is saying to Aunt Trudy. \u201cThis should be over in five.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it! Stop-it-stop-it-stop-it!\u201d The girl\u2019s voice rises to the most penetrating shriek, like feedback in my ear. I\u2019m going schizophrenic. Now I know why people assassinate presidents. There\u2019s no way I can ignore her. She\u2019s like a banshee. I can\u2019t stand this any longer. I\u2019m clutching my head, trying to block her out, but it\u2019s no good. \u201cStop! Stop! You have to stop-\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK! OK! Just... shut up!\u201d In desperation, I get to my feet. \u201cWait!\u201d I shout. \u201cStop, everybody! You have to stop the funeral! STOP THE FUNERAL!\u201d</p><p>To my relief, the girl stops shrieking.</p><p>On the downside, my entire family has turned to gape at me as if I\u2019m a lunatic. The vicar presses a button in a wooden panel set in the wall, and the organ Muzak abruptly stops.</p><p>\u201cStop the funeral?\u201d says Mum at last.</p><p>I nod silently.

My daughter hasn\u2019t been quite herself lately.

I understand.\u201d The vicar nods sympathetically. \u201cLara, we\u2019ll finish the funeral now,\u201d she says, as though I\u2019m a three-year-old. \u201cAnd then perhaps you and I will have a cup of tea together and a little talk, how about that?\u201d</p><p>She presses the button again and the organ Muzak resumes. A moment later, the coffin starts moving creakily away on its plinth, disappearing behind the curtain. Behind me I hear a sharp gasp, then-</p><p>\u201cNoooo!\u201d comes a howl of anguish. \u201cNooo! Stop! You have to stop!\u201d</p><p>To my horror, the girl runs up onto the plinth and starts trying to push the coffin back. But her arms don\u2019t work; they keep sinking through.</p><p>\u201cPlease!\u201d She looks up and addresses me desperately. \u201cDon\u2019t let them!\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m starting to feel a genuine panic here. I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m hallucinating this or what it means. But it feels real. Her torment looks real. I can\u2019t just sit back and witness this.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I shout. \u201cStop!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLara-\u201d Mum begins.</p><p>\u201cI mean it! There\u2019s a just cause and impediment why this coffin cannot be... fried. You have to stop! Now!\u201d I hurry down the aisle. \u201cPress that button or I\u2019ll do it myself!\u201d</p><p>Looking flustered, the vicar presses the button again, and the coffin comes to a standstill.</p><p>\u201cDear, perhaps you should wait outside.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s showing off, as usual!\u201d says Tonya impatiently. \u201c\u2018Just cause and impediment.\u2019 I mean, how on earth could there be? Just get on with it!\u201d she bossily addresses the vicar, who bristles slightly.</p><p>\u201cLara.\u201d She ignores Tonya and turns to me. \u201cDo you have a reason for wanting to stop your great-aunt\u2019s funeral?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that is...\u201d She pauses questioningly.</p><p>Oh God. What am I supposed to say? Because a hallucination told me to?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s because... er...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay I was murdered!\u201d I look up in shock, to see the girl right in front of me. \u201cSay it! Then they\u2019ll have to put off the funeral. Say it!\u201d She\u2019s beside me, shouting in my ear again. \u201cSay it! Say-it-say-it-say-it-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think my aunt was murdered!\u201d I blurt out in desperation.</p> <p>I have seen my family looking at me, gobsmacked, on a number of occasions in my time. But nothing has ever provoked a reaction like this. They\u2019re all turned in their seats, their jaws hanging in incomprehension like some kind of still-life painting. I almost want to laugh.</p><p>\u201cMurdered?\u201d says the vicar at last.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say forthrightly. \u201cI have reason to believe there was foul play. So we need to keep the body for evidence.\u201d</p><p>Slowly, the vicar walks toward me, narrowing her eyes, as though trying to gauge exactly how much of a time-waster I am. What she doesn\u2019t know is, I used to play staring matches with Tonya, and I always won. I gaze back, perfectly matching her grave, this-is-no-laughing-matter expression.</p><p>\u201cMurdered... how?\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather discuss that with the authorities,\u201d I shoot back, as though I\u2019m in an episode of CSI: Funeral Home .</p><p>\u201cYou want me to call the police?\u201d She\u2019s looking genuinely shocked now.</p><p>Oh God . Of course I don\u2019t want her to call the bloody police. But I can\u2019t backtrack now. I have to act convincing.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say after a pause. \u201cYes, I think that would be best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be taking her seriously!\u201d Tonya explodes. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious she\u2019s just trying to cause a sensation!\u201d</p><p>I can tell the vicar is getting a bit pissed off with Tonya, which is quite useful for me.</p><p>\u201cMy dear,\u201d she says curtly, \u201cthat decision does not rest with you. Any accusation like this has to be followed up. And your sister is quite right. The body would have to be preserved for forensics.\u201d</p><p>I think the vicar\u2019s getting into this.

I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>Shooting me various looks of alarm, outrage, and pity, my family slowly files out of the room, followed by the vicar.</p><p>I\u2019m left alone in the silent room. And it\u2019s as if the spell has suddenly broken.</p><p>What the bloody hell did I just do?</p> <p>Am I going mad?</p><p>Actually, it would explain a lot. Maybe I should just get admitted to some nice, peaceful mental home where you do drawing in a jumpsuit and don\u2019t have to think about your failing business or ex-boyfriend or parking tickets.</p><p>I sink into a chair and exhale. At the front of the room, the hallucination girl has appeared in front of the notice board, staring at the photo of the little hunched old woman.</p><p>\u201cSo, were you murdered?\u201d I can\u2019t help saying.</p><p>\u201cOh, I shouldn\u2019t think so.\u201d She\u2019s barely acknowledged me, let alone said thank you. Trust me to have a vision with no manners.</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re welcome,\u201d I say moodily. \u201cYou know. Anytime.\u201d</p><p>The girl doesn\u2019t even seem to hear. She\u2019s peering around the room as if she doesn\u2019t understand something.</p><p>\u201cWhere are all the flowers? If this is my funeral, where are the flowers?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh!\u201d I feel a squeeze of guilt. \u201cThe flowers were... put somewhere else by mistake. There were lots, honestly. Really gorgeous.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s not real, I tell myself fervently.

You realize I\u2019ll never live this down?

Her hair is dark and shiny, and the tips frame her face as she tilts her head forward. She has a long white neck, and now I can see that her huge, luminous eyes are green. Her cream leather shoes are tiny, size 4 maybe, with little buttons and Cuban heels. I\u2019d say she\u2019s about my age. Maybe even younger.</p><p>\u201cUncle Bill,\u201d she says at last, twisting the bracelet around and around. \u201cWilliam. One of Virginia \u2019s boys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Virginia was my grandmother. My dad is Michael. Which makes you my great-aunt-\u201d I break off and clutch my head. \u201cThis is crazy. How do I even know what you look like? How can I be hallucinating you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not hallucinating me!\u201d She jerks her chin up, looking offended. \u201cI\u2019m real!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be real,\u201d I say impatiently. \u201cYou\u2019re dead!

Then the girl looks away.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe in ghosts,\u201d she says disparagingly.</p><p>\u201cNor do I.\u201d I match her tone. \u201cNo way.\u201d</p> <p>The door opens and I start in shock.</p><p>\u201cLara.\u201d The vicar comes in, her face pink and flustered. \u201cI\u2019ve spoken to the police. They\u2019d like you to come down to the station.\u201d</p><p>THREE</p><p>It turns out they take murder quite seriously at police stations. Which I suppose I should have guessed. They\u2019ve put me in a little room with a table and plastic chairs and posters about locking your car. They\u2019ve given me a cup of tea and a form to fill in, and a policewoman told me a detective would be along in a moment to talk to me.</p><p>I want to laugh hysterically. Or climb out the window.</p> <p>\u201cWhat am I going to say to a detective?\u201d I exclaim, as soon as the door has closed. \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about you! How am I going to say you were murdered? With the candlestick in the drawing room?\u201d</p><p>Sadie doesn\u2019t even seem to have heard me. She\u2019s sitting on the window ledge, swinging her legs. Although when I look more closely, I notice that she\u2019s not actually on the ledge, she\u2019s floating about an inch above it. Following my gaze, she sees the gap and flinches with annoyance. She adjusts her position carefully until she looks as though she\u2019s sitting right on the ledge, then insouciantly starts swinging her legs again.</p><p>She\u2019s all in my mind, I tell myself firmly. Let\u2019s be rational here. If my own brain has conjured her up, then my own brain can get rid of her.</p><p>Go away , I think as strongly as I can, holding my breath and clenching my fists. Go away, go away, go away-</p><p>Sadie glances over me and gives a sudden giggle.</p><p>\u201cYou do look peculiar,\u201d she says. \u201cDo you have a pain in your stomach?\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m about to make a retort when the door opens-and my stomach really does twinge. It\u2019s a detective, wearing plain-clothes, which makes it almost more scary than if he was in uniform. Oh God. I am in such trouble.</p><p>\u201cLara.\u201d The detective holds out his hand. He\u2019s tall and broad, with dark hair and a brisk manner. \u201cDI James.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d My voice is squeaky with nerves. \u201cNice to meet you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo.\u201d He sits down in a businesslike way and takes out a pen. \u201cI understand you stopped your great-aunt\u2019s funeral.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d I nod with as much conviction as I can muster. \u201cI just think there was something suspicious about her death.\u201d</p><p>DI James makes a note, then looks up. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>I stare blankly back at him, my heart pounding. I have no answer. I should have made something up, very quickly. I\u2019m an idiot .</p><p>\u201cWell... don\u2019t you think it suspicious?\u201d I improvise at last. \u201cHer just dying like that? I mean, people don\u2019t just die out of the blue!\u201d</p> <p>DI James regards me with an unreadable expression. \u201cI believe she was one hundred and five years old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what?\u201d I retort, gaining confidence. \u201cCan\u2019t people of a hundred and five be murdered too? I didn\u2019t think the police were so ageist.\u201d</p><p>DI James\u2019s face flickers, whether with amusement or annoyance I can\u2019t tell.</p><p>\u201cWho do you think murdered your great-aunt?\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cIt was...\u201d I rub my nose, playing for time. \u201cIt\u2019s... rather... complicated...\u201d I glance helplessly up at Sadie.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re useless!\u201d she cries. \u201cYou need a story or they won\u2019t believe you! They won\u2019t delay the funeral any longer! Say it was the staff at the nursing home! Say you heard them plotting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I exclaim in shock before I can help myself.</p><p>DI James gives me an odd look and clears his throat.</p><p>\u201cLara, do you have a genuine reason for believing something was amiss with your great-aunt\u2019s death?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay it was the staff at the nursing home!\u201d Sadie\u2019s voice is in my ear like a screeching brake. \u201cSay it! Say it! SAY IT!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was the staff at the nursing home,\u201d I blurt out in desperation. \u201cI think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat grounds do you have for saying this?\u201d</p><p>DI James\u2019s tone is even, but his eyes are alert. In front of him, Sadie is hovering, glowering at me and wheeling her hands around, as though to crank the words out of me. The sight is totally freaking me out.</p><p>\u201cI... er... I overheard them whispering in the pub. Something about poison and insurance.

Testify is one of those very scary words, like tax inspector and lumbar puncture .

DI James has finished writing and is flicking his pen backward and forward.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just going to consult with a colleague.\u201d He stands up. \u201cI\u2019ll be back in a minute.\u201d</p><p>The moment he\u2019s left the room, Sadie gives me a contemptuous look.</p><p>\u201cIs that the best you could do? He\u2019ll never believe you! You were supposed to be helping me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy accusing random people of murder?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be such a goose,\u201d she says dismissively. \u201cYou didn\u2019t accuse anyone by name. In fact, your story was utterly hopeless. Poison? Whispered conversations in pubs?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou try making something up on the spot!\u201d I reply defensively. \u201cAnd that\u2019s not the point! The point is-\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe point is, we need to delay my funeral.\u201d She\u2019s suddenly about two inches away from me, her eyes intense and pleading. \u201cIt can\u2019t happen. You can\u2019t let it. Not yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut-\u201d I blink in surprise as she disappears right before my eyes. God, this is annoying. I feel like I\u2019m Alice in Wonderland. Any minute she\u2019ll reappear with a flamingo under her arm, shouting, \u201cOff with her head!\u201d</p><p>Leaning gingerly back in my chair, half expecting that to disappear too, I blink a few times, trying to process everything. But it\u2019s too surreal. I\u2019m sitting in a police station, inventing a murder, being bossed around by a nonexistent phantom girl. I never even got any lunch, it occurs to me. Maybe this is all due to low blood sugar. Maybe I\u2019m diabetic and this is the first sign. My mind feels like it\u2019s tying itself up in knots. Nothing makes any sense. There\u2019s no point trying to work out what\u2019s going on. I\u2019ll just have to go with the flow.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re going to pursue it!\u201d Sadie appears again, speaking so fast I can barely follow her. \u201cThey think you\u2019re probably deluded, but they\u2019re going to follow it up anyway, just in case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I say incredulously.</p><p>\u201cThat policeman\u2019s been talking to another policeman,\u201d she explains breathlessly. \u201cI followed them. He showed him your notes and said, \u2018Got a right one here.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cA \u2018right one\u2019?\u201d I can\u2019t help echoing indignantly.</p> <p>Sadie ignores me. \u201cBut then they started talking about some other nursing home where there was a murder. Sounds too ghastly. And one policeman said maybe they should put in a phone call just in case, and the other agreed. So we\u2019re all right.\u201d</p><p>All right?</p><p>\u201cYou may be all right! But I\u2019m not!\u201d</p><p>As the door swings open, Sadie adds quickly, \u201cAsk the policeman what\u2019s going to be done about the funeral. Ask him. Ask him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not my problem-\u201d I begin, then hastily stop as DI James\u2019s head appears around the door.</p><p>\u201cLara, I\u2019m going to ask a detective constable to take a statement from you. Then we\u2019ll decide how to progress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Er... thanks.\u201d I\u2019m aware of Sadie glaring meaningfully at me. \u201cAnd what will happen to...\u201d I hesitate. \u201cHow does it work with the... body?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe body will be kept at the mortuary for now. If we decide to proceed with an investigation, it will remain there until we file a report to the coroner, who will demand an inquest, should the evidence be sufficiently credible and consistent.\u201d</p><p>He nods briskly, then heads out. As the door closes I subside. I\u2019m suddenly feeling shaky all over. I\u2019ve invented a murder story to a real policeman. This is the worst thing I\u2019ve ever done. Even worse than the time I ate half a packet of biscuits aged eight and, rather than confess to Mum, hid the whole biscuit tin in the garden behind the rosebush and had to watch her search the kitchen for it.</p><p>\u201cYou realize I\u2019ve just committed perjury?\u201d I say to Sadie. \u201cYou realize they might arrest me?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201c\u2018They might arrest me,\u2019\u201d Sadie echoes mockingly.

It was too funny.\u201d She starts to giggle. \u201cWe had some mock handcuffs, you know, as part of a fancy dress costume, and while the policeman was hauling me out of the pond, my friend Bunty locked her handcuffs round him as a lark. He was livid!\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s in paroxysms of laughter by now. God, she\u2019s annoying.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it was hilarious.\u201d I shoot her a baleful look. \u201cBut, personally, I\u2019d rather not go to jail and catch some hideous disease, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you wouldn\u2019t have to if you had a better story.\u201d Her laughter stops. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen such a ninny. You weren\u2019t credible or consistent. At this rate they won\u2019t even proceed with the investigation. We won\u2019t have any time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTime for what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTime to find my necklace , of course.\u201d</p><p>I drop my head down on the table with a clunk. She doesn\u2019t give up, does she?</p> <p>\u201cLook,\u201d I say at last, raising my head an inch. \u201cWhy do you need this necklace so badly? Why this one particular necklace? Was it a present or something?\u201d</p><p>For a moment she\u2019s silent, her eyes distant. The only movement in the room is her feet, swinging rhythmically back and forth.</p><p>\u201cIt was a present from my parents for my twenty-first birthday,\u201d she says at last. \u201cI was happy when I wore it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s nice,\u201d I say. \u201cBut-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had it all my life. I wore it all my life.\u201d She sounds suddenly agitated. \u201cNo matter what else I lost, I kept that. It\u2019s the most important thing I ever had. I need it.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s fidgeting with her hands, her face tilted down so all I can see is the corner of her chin. She\u2019s so thin and pale, she looks like a drooping flower. I feel a pang of sympathy for her, and am about to say, \u201cOf course I\u2019ll find your necklace,\u201d when she yawns elaborately, stretching her skinny arms above her head, and says, \u201cThis is too dull. I wish we could go to a nightclub.\u201d</p> <p>I glare at her, all my sympathy gone. Is this the gratitude I get?</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re so bored,\u201d I say, \u201cwe can go and finish your funeral if you like.\u201d</p><p>Sadie claps a hand over her mouth and gasps. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might.\u201d</p><p>A knock at the door interrupts us, and a jolly-looking woman in a dark shirt and trousers puts her head around it. \u201cLara Lington?\u201d</p><p>An hour later, I\u2019ve finished giving my so-called \u201cstatement.\u201d I\u2019ve never had such a traumatic experience in my life. What a shambles.</p><p>First I forgot the name of the nursing home. Then I got my timings all wrong and had to convince the policewoman it had taken me five minutes to walk half a mile. I ended up saying I was training to be a professional speed walker. Just thinking about it makes me cringey and hot. There\u2019s no way she believed me. I mean, do I look like a professional speed walker?</p><p>Then I said I\u2019d been to my friend Linda\u2019s before visiting the pub. I don\u2019t even have a friend called Linda; I just didn\u2019t want to mention any of my real friends. She wanted Linda\u2019s surname, and I blurted out \u201cDavies\u201d before I could stop myself.</p> <p>Of course, I\u2019d read it off the top of the form. She was DC Davies.</p><p>At least I didn\u2019t say \u201cKeyser S\u00f6ze.\u201d</p><p>To her credit, the policewoman didn\u2019t flicker. Nor did she say whether they would proceed with the case. She just thanked me politely and found me the number of a cab firm.</p><p>I\u2019ll probably go to jail now. Great. All I need.</p><p>I glower at Sadie, who\u2019s lying full length on the desk, staring up at the ceiling. It really didn\u2019t help having her in my ear the whole time, constantly correcting me and adding suggestions and reminiscing about the time two policemen tried to stop her and Bunty \u201cracing their motors over the fields\u201d and couldn\u2019t catch up with them; it was \u201c too funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d I say. \u201cAgain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Sadie\u2019s voice drifts idly over.</p><p>\u201cRight, well.\u201d I pick up my bag. \u201cI\u2019m off.\u201d</p><p>In one quick movement, Sadie sits up. \u201cYou won\u2019t forget my necklace, will you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt I will, my entire life.\u201d I roll my eyes. \u201cHowever hard I try.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Suddenly she\u2019s in front of me, blocking my way to the door. \u201cNo one can see me except you. No one else can help me. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, you can\u2019t just say, \u2018Find my necklace!\u2019\u201d I exclaim in exasperation. \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about it, I don\u2019t know what it looks like...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s made of glass beads with rhinestones,\u201d she says eagerly. \u201cIt falls to here...\u201d She gestures at her waist. \u201cThe clasp is inlaid mother-of-pearl-\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d I cut her off. \u201cWell, I haven\u2019t seen it. If it turns up, I\u2019ll let you know.\u201d</p> <p>I swing past her, push the door open into the police-station foyer, and take out my phone. The foyer is brightly lit, with a grubby linoleum floor and a desk, which right now is empty. Two huge guys in hoodies are having a loud argument while a policeman is trying to calm them down, and I back away to what looks like a safe corner. I get out the minicab firm number DC Davies gave me and start keying it into my phone. I can see there are about twenty voice messages on there, but I ignore them all. It\u2019ll just be Mum and Dad, stressing away...</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d A voice interrupts me and I pause midway through. \u201cLara? Is that you?\u201d</p><p>A guy with sandy hair in a polo neck and jeans is waving at me. \u201cIt\u2019s me! Mark Phillipson? Sixth-form college?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMark!\u201d I exclaim, suddenly recognizing him. \u201cOh my God! How are you doing?\u201d</p><p>The only thing I remember about Mark is him playing bass guitar in the college band.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m fine! Great.\u201d He comes across with a concerned expression. \u201cWhat are you doing at the police station? Is everything OK?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh! Yes, I\u2019m fine. I\u2019m just here for a... you know.\u201d I wave it off. \u201cMurder thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMurder?\u201d He looks staggered.</p><p>\u201cYeah. But it\u2019s no big deal. I mean, obviously it is a big deal...\u201d I correct myself hastily at his expression. \u201cI\u2019d better not say too much about it... Anyway, how are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat! Married to Anna, remember her?\u201d He flashes a silver wedding ring. \u201cTrying to make it as a painter. I do this stuff on the side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a policeman?\u201d I say disbelievingly, and he laughs.</p> <p>\u201cPolice artist. People describe the villains, I draw them; it pays the rent... So how about you, Lara? Are you married? With somebody?\u201d</p><p>For a moment I just stare back with a rictus smile.</p><p>\u201cI was with this guy for a while,\u201d I say at last. \u201cIt didn\u2019t work out. But I\u2019m fine about it now. I\u2019m in a really good place, actually.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve clenched my plastic cup so hard, it\u2019s cracked. Mark looks a bit disconcerted.</p><p>\u201cWell... see you, Lara.\u201d He lifts a hand. \u201cWill you be OK getting home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m calling a cab.\u201d I nod. \u201cThanks. Nice to bump into you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let him go!\u201d Sadie\u2019s voice in my ear makes me jump out of my skin. \u201cHe can help!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up and leave me alone,\u201d I mutter out of the corner of my mouth, shooting an even brighter smile at Mark. \u201cBye, Mark. Give my love to Anna.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe can draw the necklace! Then you\u2019ll know what you\u2019re looking for!\u201d She\u2019s suddenly right in front of me. \u201cAsk him! Quickly!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk him!\u201d Her banshee voice is coming back, piercing my eardrum. \u201cAsk-him-ask-him-ask-him-\u201d</p><p>Oh, for God\u2019s sake, she\u2019s going to drive me insane.</p><p>\u201cMark!\u201d I call, so loudly that the two guys in hoodies stop fighting and stare at me. \u201cI\u2019ve got this tiny favor to ask you, if you have a moment...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Mark shrugs.</p><p>We go into a side room, with cups of tea from the machine. We pull up chairs to a table and Mark gets out his paper and artist\u2019s pencils.</p><p>\u201cSo.\u201d He raises his eyebrows. \u201cA necklace. That\u2019s a new one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw it once at an antiques fair,\u201d I improvise. \u201cAnd I\u2019d love to commission one like it, but I\u2019m so bad at drawing things, and it suddenly occurred to me that maybe you could help...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem. Fire away.\u201d Mark takes a sip of tea, his pencil poised over the paper, and I glance up at Sadie.</p><p>\u201cIt was made of beads,\u201d she says, holding up her hands as though she can almost feel it. \u201cTwo rows of glass beads, almost translucent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s two rows of beads,\u201d I say. \u201cAlmost translucent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d He nods, already sketching circular beads. \u201cLike this?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMore oval,\u201d says Sadie, peering over his shoulder. \u201cLonger. And there were rhinestones in between.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe beads were more oval,\u201d I say apologetically. \u201cWith rhinestones in between.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem...\u201d Mark is already rubbing out and sketching longer beads. \u201cLike this?\u201d</p><p>I glance up at Sadie. She\u2019s watching him, mesmerized. \u201cAnd the dragonfly,\u201d she murmurs. \u201cYou mustn\u2019t forget the dragonfly.\u201d</p> <p>For another five minutes, Mark sketches, rubs out, and sketches again, as I relay Sadie\u2019s comments. Slowly, gradually, the necklace comes alive on the page.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d says Sadie at last. Her eyes are shining as she gazes down. \u201cThat\u2019s my necklace!\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect,\u201d I say to Mark. \u201cYou\u2019ve got it.\u201d</p><p>For a moment we all survey it in silence.</p><p>\u201cNice,\u201d says Mark at last, jerking his head at it. \u201cUnusual. Reminds me of something.\u201d He frowns at the sketch for a moment, then shakes his head. \u201cNo. Lost it.\u201d He glances at his watch. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I have to dash-\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine,\u201d I say quickly. \u201cThanks so much.\u201d</p><p>When he\u2019s gone, I pick up the paper and look at the necklace. It\u2019s very pretty, I have to admit. Long rows of glassy beads, sparkling rhinestones, and a big ornamental pendant in the shape of a dragonfly, studded with even more rhinestones.</p><p>\u201cSo this is what we\u2019re looking for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Sadie looks up, her face full of animation. \u201cExactly! Where shall we start?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to be joking!\u201d I reach for my jacket and stand up. \u201cI\u2019m not looking for anything now. I\u2019m going home and having a nice glass of wine. And then I\u2019m having a chicken korma with naan. New-fangled modern food,\u201d I explain, noticing her bemused expression. \u201cAnd then I\u2019m going to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what shall I do?\u201d says Sadie, suddenly looking deflated.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d</p><p>I head out of the side room, back into the foyer. A taxi is offloading an elderly couple onto the pavement outside, and I hurry out, calling, \u201cTaxi? Can you take me to Kilburn?\u201d</p><p>As the taxi moves off, I spread out the sketch on my lap and look at the necklace again, trying to imagine it in real life. Sadie described the beads as a kind of pale yellow iridescent glass. Even in the drawing, the rhinestones are sparkling all over. The real thing must be stunning. Worth a bit too. Just for a moment I feel a flicker of excitement at the thought of actually finding it.</p><p>But an instant later, sanity checks back into my brain. I mean, it probably doesn\u2019t exist. And even if it did, the chances of finding some random necklace belonging to a dead old lady who probably lost it or broke it years ago are approximately... three million to one. No, three billion to one.</p><p>At last I fold the paper and tuck it in my bag, then flop back on my seat. I don\u2019t know where Sadie is and I don\u2019t care. I close my eyes, ignoring the constant vibrations of my mobile phone, and let myself doze off. What a day.</p><p>FOUR</p><p>The next day the sketch of the necklace is all I have left. Sadie has disappeared and the whole episode feels like a dream. At eight-thirty I\u2019m sitting at my desk, sipping coffee and staring down at the picture. What on earth got into me yesterday? The entire thing must have been my brain cracking up under the strain. The necklace, the girl, the banshee wailing... It was obviously all a figment of my imagination.</p><p>For the first time, I\u2019m starting to sympathize with my parents. I\u2019m worried about me too.</p> <p>\u201cHi!\u201d There\u2019s a crash as Kate, our assistant, swings open the door, knocking over a bunch of files, which I\u2019d put on the floor while I got the milk out of the fridge.</p><p>We don\u2019t have the biggest office in the world.</p><p>\u201cSo, how was the funeral?\u201d Kate hangs up her coat, leaning right back over the photocopier to reach her hook. Luckily, she\u2019s quite gymnastic.</p><p>\u201cNot great. In fact, I ended up at the police station. I had this weird mental flip-out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod!\u201d Kate looks horrified. \u201cAre you OK?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I mean, I think so...\u201d I have to get a grip. Abruptly, I fold up the necklace sketch, thrust it into my bag, and zip it shut.</p><p>\u201cActually, I knew something was up.\u201d Kate pauses halfway through twisting her blond hair into an elastic. \u201cYour dad called yesterday afternoon and asked me if you\u2019d been particularly stressed recently.\u201d</p><p>I look up in alarm. \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell him about Natalie leaving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! Of course not!\u201d Kate has been well trained in what to divulge to my parents-i.e., nothing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnyway,\u201d I say with more vigor. \u201cNever mind. I\u2019m fine now. Were there any messages?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Kate reaches for her notebook with a super-efficient manner. \u201cShireen kept calling all yesterday. She\u2019s going to call you today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat!\u201d</p><p>Shireen is our one piece of good news at L &amp;N Executive Recruitment. We recently placed her as operations director at a software company, Macrosant; in fact, she\u2019s about to start the job next week. She\u2019s probably just calling to thank us.</p> <p>\u201cAnything else?\u201d I say, just as the phone rings. Kate checks the caller ID and her eyes widen.</p><p>\u201cOh yes, another thing,\u201d she says hurriedly. \u201cJanet from Leonidas Sports called, wanting an update. She said she was going to ring at nine a.m. sharp. This\u2019ll be her.\u201d She meets my panicky eyes. \u201cDo you want me to answer?\u201d</p><p>No, I want to hide under the desk.</p><p>\u201cUm, yes, you\u2019d better.\u201d</p><p>My stomach is bubbling with nerves. Leonidas Sports is our biggest client. They\u2019re a massive sports equipment company with shops all over the UK, and we\u2019ve promised to find them a marketing director.</p> <p>Rephrase that. Natalie promised to find them a marketing director.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just put you through,\u201d Kate is saying in her best PA voice, and a moment later the phone on my desk rings. I glance desperately at Kate, then pick it up.</p><p>\u201cJanet!\u201d I exclaim in my most confident tones. \u201cGood to hear from you. I was just about to call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Lara,\u201d comes Janet Grady\u2019s familiar hoarse voice. \u201cJust phoning for an update. I was hoping to speak to Natalie.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve never met Janet Grady face-to-face. But in my head she\u2019s about six foot three with a mustache. The first time we ever spoke, she told me the team at Leonidas Sports are all \u201ctough thinkers,\u201d \u201chard players,\u201d and have an \u201ciron grip\u201d on the market. They sound terrifying.</p><p>\u201cOh right!\u201d I twist the phone cord around my fingers. \u201cWell, unfortunately Natalie\u2019s still... er... poorly.\u201d</p> <p>This is the story I\u2019ve been spinning ever since Natalie didn\u2019t make it back from Goa. Luckily, you just have to say \u201cShe\u2019s been to India,\u201d and everyone launches into their own My Horrendous Traveling Illness story without asking any more questions.</p><p>\u201cBut we\u2019re making great headway,\u201d I continue. \u201cReally marvelous. We\u2019re working through the long list, and there\u2019s a file of very strong candidates right here on my desk. We\u2019ll be looking at a top-class short list, I can assure you. All tough thinkers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you give me any names?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot right now!\u201d My voice jumps in panic. \u201cI\u2019ll fill you in nearer the time. But you\u2019ll be very impressed!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK, Lara.\u201d Janet is one of those women who never waste time on small talk. \u201cWell, as long as you\u2019re on top of it. Best to Natalie. Good-bye.\u201d</p><p>I replace the receiver and meet Kate\u2019s eyes, my heart thumping. \u201cRemind me, who do we have as possibles for Leonidas Sports?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe guy with the three-year gap in his r\u00e9sum\u00e9,\u201d says Kate. \u201cAnd the weirdo with the dandruff. And... the kleptomaniac woman.\u201d</p><p>I wait for her to continue. She gives a tiny apologetic shrug.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s all ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaul Richards pulled out yesterday,\u201d she says anxiously. \u201cHe\u2019s been offered a position at some American company. Here\u2019s the list.\u201d She hands me the sheet of paper and I stare at the three names in total despair. They\u2019re all no-hopers. We can\u2019t send this list in.</p><p>God, headhunting is hard. I had no idea. Before we started up the company, Natalie always made it seem so exciting. She talked about the thrill of the chase, \u201cstrategic hiring\u201d and \u201cup-skilling\u201d and \u201cthe tap on the shoulder.\u201d We used to meet every few weeks for a drink, and she was full of such amazing stories about her work, I couldn\u2019t help feeling envious. Writing promotional website copy for a car manufacturer seemed really dull in comparison. Plus there were rumors we were going to have big layoffs. So when Natalie suggested a start-up, I jumped at the chance.</p><p>The truth is, I\u2019ve always been a bit in awe of Natalie. She\u2019s so glossy and confident. Even when we were at school, she always had the latest slang and could blag us into pubs. And when we first started off the company, it all worked brilliantly. She brought in some big bits of business for us at once and was constantly out networking. I was writing our website and supposedly learning all the tricks from her. It was all going in the right direction. Until she disappeared and I realized I hadn\u2019t actually learned any tricks at all. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Natalie\u2019s really into business mantras, and they\u2019re all on Post-its around her desk. I keep sidling over and studying them, as if they\u2019re the runes to some ancient religion, trying to divine what I\u2019m meant to do. For example, The best talent is already in the market is stuck up above her computer. That one I do know: It means you\u2019re not supposed to go through the r\u00e9sum\u00e9s of all the bankers who were fired from an investment bank last week and try to make them sound like marketing directors. You\u2019re supposed to go after existing marketing directors.</p><p>But how? What if they won\u2019t even speak to you?</p><p>After doing this job for several weeks on my own, I have a few new mantras, which go as follows: The best talent doesn\u2019t answer the phone itself. The best talent doesn\u2019t ring back, even if you leave three messages with its secretary. The best talent doesn\u2019t want to move into sports retail. When you mention the fifty percent employee discount on tennis rackets, the best talent just laughs at you .</p><p>I pull out our original crumpled, coffee-stained long list for the millionth time and flick through it gloomily. Names glitter off the page like shiny sweeties. Employed, bona fide talent. The marketing director of Woodhouse Retail. The European marketing head at Dartmouth Plastics. They can\u2019t all be happy at their jobs, surely. There must be someone out there who would love to work for Leonidas Sports. But I\u2019ve tried every single name and got nowhere. I glance up to see Kate standing on one foot, surveying me anxiously, the other leg wrapped around her calf.</p> <p>\u201cWe have precisely three weeks to find a tough-thinking, hard-hitting marketing director for Leonidas Sports.\u201d I\u2019m trying desperately to stay positive. Natalie landed this deal. Natalie was going to woo all the starry candidates. Natalie knows how to do this. I don\u2019t .</p><p>Anyway. No point dwelling on that now.</p><p>\u201cOK.\u201d I slap my hand on the desk. \u201cI\u2019m going to make some calls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make you a fresh coffee.\u201d Kate springs into action. \u201cWe\u2019ll stay here all night if we have to.\u201d</p><p>I love Kate. She acts like she\u2019s in a film about some really thrusting multinational company, instead of two people in a ten-foot-square office with moldy carpet.</p> <p>\u201cSalary, salary, salary,\u201d she says as she sits down.</p><p>\u201cYou snooze, you lose,\u201d I respond.</p><p>Kate got into reading Natalie\u2019s mantras too. Now we can\u2019t stop quoting them at each other. The trouble is, they don\u2019t actually tell you how to do the job. What I need is the mantra telling you how to get past the question \u201cMay I ask what it is in connection with?\u201d</p><p>I swing my chair over to Natalie\u2019s desk to get out all the Leonidas Sports paperwork. The cardboard file has fallen off its hangers inside her drawer, so with a muttered curse I gather all the papers together and pull them out. Then suddenly I stop, as I notice an old Post-it which has somehow attached itself to my hand. I\u2019ve never seen this before. James Yates, mobile is written in faded purple felt-tip. And then a number.</p><p>A mobile number for James Yates. I don\u2019t believe it! He\u2019s marketing director at Feltons Breweries! He\u2019s on the long list! He\u2019d be perfect! Whenever I\u2019ve tried his office, I\u2019ve been told he\u2019s \u201cabroad.\u201d But wherever he is, he\u2019ll have his mobile, won\u2019t he? Trembling with excitement, I push my chair back to my own desk and dial the number.</p><p>\u201cJames Yates.\u201d The line is a little crackly but I can still hear him.</p> <p>\u201cHi,\u201d I say, trying to sound as confident as possible. \u201cIt\u2019s Lara Lington here. Can you talk?\u201d This is what Natalie always says on the phone; I\u2019ve heard her.</p><p>\u201cWho is this?\u201d He sounds suspicious. \u201cDid you say you\u2019re from Lingtons?\u201d</p><p>I give an inward sigh.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m from L &amp;N Executive Recruitment, and I was phoning to see if you\u2019d be interested in a new position, heading up marketing in a dynamic, growing retail company. It\u2019s a very exciting opportunity, so if you\u2019d like to discuss it, perhaps over a discreet lunch at a restaurant of your choice...\u201d I\u2019m going to die if I don\u2019t breathe, so I stop and gasp for air.</p><p>\u201cL &amp;N?\u201d He sounds wary. \u201cI don\u2019t know you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re a relatively new outfit, myself and Natalie Masser-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot interested.\u201d He cuts me off.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a marvelous opportunity,\u201d I say quickly. \u201cYou\u2019ll have a chance to expand your horizons; there\u2019s a lot of exciting potential in Europe -\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSorry. Good-bye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd a ten percent discount on sportswear!\u201d I call desperately down the dead phone. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He\u2019s gone.

Oh, Shireen! Great to hear from you! I\u2019ll put you through to Lara.\u201d She beams at me and I grin back. At least we\u2019ve had one triumph.</p> <p>I suppose strictly speaking it was Natalie\u2019s triumph, since she made the placement, but I\u2019ve been doing all the follow-up work. Anyway, it\u2019s a company triumph.</p><p>\u201cHi, Shireen!\u201d I say cheerfully. \u201cAll set for the new job? I just know it\u2019s going to be a great position for you-\u201d</p><p>\u201cLara.\u201d Shireen interrupts tensely. \u201cThere\u2019s a problem.\u201d</p><p>My stomach plunges. No. No. Please no problems.</p><p>\u201cProblem?\u201d I force myself to sound relaxed. \u201cWhat kind of problem?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s my dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour dog?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m intending to take Flash into work every day. But I just phoned human resources about setting up a basket for him, and they said it was impossible. They said it wasn\u2019t their policy to allow animals in the offices, can you believe it?\u201d</p><p>She clearly expects me to be as outraged as she is. I stare at the phone in bewilderment. How has a dog suddenly entered the picture?</p><p>\u201cLara? Are you there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d I come to. \u201cShireen, listen to me. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re really fond of Flash. But it\u2019s not usual to take dogs into the workplace-\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, it is!\u201d she interrupts. \u201cThere\u2019s another dog in the building. I\u2019ve heard it every time I\u2019ve been in. That\u2019s why I assumed it would be fine! I never would have taken this job otherwise! They\u2019re discriminating against me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019re not discriminating,\u201d I say hurriedly. \u201cI\u2019ll call them straightaway.\u201d I put down the phone, then quickly dial the HR department at Macrosant. \u201cHi, Jean? It\u2019s Lara Lington here, from L &amp;N Executive Recruitment. I just wanted to clarify a small point. Is Shireen Moore permitted to bring her dog to work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe whole building has a no-dog policy,\u201d says Jean pleasantly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Lara, it\u2019s an insurance thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Absolutely. I understand.\u201d I pause. \u201cThe thing is, Shireen believes she\u2019s heard another dog in the building. Several times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s mistaken,\u201d Jean says after the tiniest of beats. \u201cThere are no dogs here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone at all? Not even one little puppy?\u201d My suspicions have been aroused by that pause.</p><p>\u201cNot even one little puppy.\u201d Jean has regained her smoothness. \u201cAs I say, there\u2019s a no-dog policy in the building.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you couldn\u2019t make an exception for Shireen?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid not.\u201d She\u2019s polite but implacable.</p><p>\u201cWell, thanks for your time.\u201d</p><p>I put the phone down and tap my pencil silently on my notepad for a few seconds. Something\u2019s up. I bet there is a dog there. But what can I do about it? I can\u2019t exactly phone Jean back and say, \u201cI don\u2019t believe you.\u201d</p><p>With a sigh, I redial Shireen\u2019s number.</p><p>\u201cLara, is that you?\u201d She picks up straightaway, as though she\u2019s been sitting by the phone, waiting for an answer, which she probably has. She\u2019s very bright, Shireen, and very intense. I can picture her now, drawing that endless crisscross of squares which she obsessively doodles everywhere. She probably needs a dog, just to stay sane.</p><p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s me. I called Jean and she says no one else in the building has a dog. She says it\u2019s an insurance thing.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s silence as Shireen digests this.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s lying,\u201d she says at last. \u201cThere is a dog in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShireen...\u201d I feel like banging my head against the desk. \u201cCouldn\u2019t you have mentioned the dog before? At one of the interviews, maybe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI assumed it would be OK!\u201d she says defensively. \u201cI heard the other dog barking! You can tell when there\u2019s a dog in a place. Well, I\u2019m not working without Flash. I\u2019m sorry, Lara, I\u2019ll have to pull out of the job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNooo!\u201d I cry out in dismay before I can stop myself. \u201cI mean... please don\u2019t do anything rash, Shireen! I\u2019ll sort this out, I promise. I\u2019ll call you soon.\u201d Breathing heavily, I put the phone down and bury my head in my hands. \u201cCrap!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d ventures Kate anxiously. She clearly overheard the whole thing.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I admit. \u201cWhat would Natalie do?\u201d</p><p>Both of us instinctively glance toward Natalie\u2019s desk, gleaming and empty. I have a sudden vision of Natalie sitting there: her lacquered nails tapping on the desk, her voice raised in some high-octane call. Since she\u2019s been gone, the volume level in this office has dropped by about eighty percent.</p><p>\u201cShe might tell Shireen she had to take the job and threaten to sue her if she didn\u2019t,\u201d says Kate at last.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019d definitely tell Shireen to get over herself.\u201d I nod in agreement. \u201cShe\u2019d call her unprofessional and flaky.\u201d</p><p>I once heard Natalie tearing a strip off some guy who had second thoughts about taking up a position in Dubai. It wasn\u2019t pretty.</p><p>The deep-down truth, which I don\u2019t want to admit to anyone, is that now I\u2019ve got to know the way Natalie thinks and does business... I don\u2019t really relate to a lot of it. What appealed to me about this job was working with people, changing lives. When we used to meet up and Natalie would tell me her stories of finding talent, I was always just as interested in the story behind the deal as the deal itself. I thought it must be so much more satisfying to help people\u2019s careers than to sell cars. But that aspect doesn\u2019t seem to feature highly on our agenda.</p><p>I mean, OK, I know I\u2019m a novice. And maybe I am a bit idealistic, like Dad always says. But your job is one of the most important things in your life, surely. It should be right for you. Salary isn\u2019t everything.</p><p>There again, that\u2019ll be why Natalie\u2019s the successful head-hunter with loads of commission under her belt. And I\u2019m not. And right now we need commission.</p> <p>\u201cSo what we\u2019re saying is, I should ring Shireen back and give her a hard time,\u201d I say reluctantly. There\u2019s silence. Kate looks as pained as I feel.</p><p>\u201cThing is, Lara,\u201d she says hesitantly, \u201cyou\u2019re not Natalie. She\u2019s away. So you\u2019re the boss. So you should do things your way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d I feel a surge of relief. \u201cThat\u2019s true. I\u2019m the boss. So what I say is... I\u2019ll think about it for a while first.\u201d</p><p>Trying to look as though this is a decisive piece of action instead of a cop-out, I push the phone aside and start leafing through the post. A bill for office paper. An offer to send all my staff on a team-building trip to Aspen. And, at the bottom of the pile, Business People , which is like the celebrity magazine of business. I open it and start flipping through the pages, trying to find someone who would make a perfect marketing director for Leonidas Sports.</p><p>Business People is essential reading for a headhunter. It\u2019s basically endless photo spreads of thrusting, super-groomed types who have massive offices with plenty of space to hang up their coats. But God, it\u2019s depressing. As I turn from one highflier to another, my spirits sink lower and lower. What\u2019s wrong with me? I only speak one language. I haven\u2019t been asked to chair any international committees. I don\u2019t have a working wardrobe which pairs Dolce &amp; Gabbana trouser suits with quirky shirts from Paul Smith.</p><p>Dolefully, I close the magazine and slump back, staring at the grimy ceiling. How do they all do it? My uncle Bill. Everyone in this magazine. They decide to run a business and it\u2019s instantly a success, and it looks so easy...</p> <p>\u201cYes... yes...\u201d Suddenly I become aware of Kate making semaphore signals across the room. I look up to see her face all pink with excitement as she talks on the phone. \u201cI\u2019m sure Lara would be able to make space for you in her schedule, if you could just hold on a moment...\u201d</p><p>She presses Hold and squeaks, \u201cIt\u2019s Clive Hoxton! The one who said he wasn\u2019t interested in Leonidas Sports?\u201d she adds, at my blank look. \u201cThe rugby guy? Well, he might be after all! He wants to have lunch and talk about it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God! Him!\u201d My spirits shoot back up. Clive Hoxton is marketing director at Arberry Stores and used to play rugby for Doncaster. He couldn\u2019t be more perfect for the Leonidas Sports job, but when I first approached him he said he didn\u2019t want to move. I can\u2019t believe he\u2019s got in touch!</p><p>\u201cPlay it cool!\u201d I whisper urgently. \u201cPretend I\u2019m really busy interviewing other candidates.\u201d</p><p>Kate nods vigorously.</p><p>\u201cLet me just see...\u201d she says into the phone. \u201cLara\u2019s schedule is very packed today, but I\u2019ll see what I can do... Ah! Now, what a stroke of luck! She unexpectedly has a vacancy! Would you like to name a restaurant?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She grins broadly at me and I give her an air high-five.

In fact, if we get him, I\u2019ll ax the kleptomaniac, I decide. And the weirdo isn\u2019t that bad, if we could just get rid of his dandruff...</p><p>\u201cAll fixed up!\u201d Kate puts the phone down. \u201cYou\u2019re having lunch today at one o\u2019clock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent! Where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s the only thing.\u201d Kate hesitates. \u201cI asked him to name a restaurant. And he named-\u201d She breaks off.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d My heart starts to thump anxiously. \u201cNot Gordon Ramsay. Not that posh one in Claridge\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Kate winces. \u201cWorse. Lyle Place.\u201d</p><p>My insides shrivel. \u201cYou have to be kidding.\u201d</p><p>Lyle Place opened about two years ago and was instantly christened the most expensive restaurant in Europe. It has a massive lobster tank and a fountain, and loads of celebrities go there. Obviously I\u2019ve never been there. I\u2019ve just read about it in the Evening Standard .</p><p>We should never, never, never have let him name the restaurant. I should have named it. I would have named Pasta Pot, which is around the corner and does a set lunch for \u00a312.95 including a glass of wine. I daren\u2019t even think how much lunch for two at Lyle Place is going to be.</p> <p>\u201cWe won\u2019t be able to get in!\u201d I say in sudden relief. \u201cIt\u2019ll be too busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said he can get a reservation. He knows some people. He\u2019ll put it in your name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn.\u201d</p><p>Kate is nibbling at her thumbnail anxiously. \u201cHow much is in the client entertainment kitty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout 50 p,\u201d I say in despair. \u201cWe\u2019re broke. I\u2019ll have to use my own credit card.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019ll be worth it,\u201d says Kate resolutely. \u201cIt\u2019s an investment. You\u2019ve got to look like a mover and a shaker. If people see you eating at Lyle Place, they\u2019ll think, Wow, Lara Lington must be doing well if she can afford to take clients here!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut I can\u2019t afford it!\u201d I wail. \u201cCould we phone him up and change it to a cup of coffee?\u201d</p><p>Even as I\u2019m saying it, I know how lame this would look. If he wants lunch, I have to give him lunch. If he wants to go to Lyle Place, we have to go to Lyle Place.</p><p>\u201cMaybe it isn\u2019t as expensive as we think,\u201d says Kate hopefully. \u201cI mean, all the newspapers keep saying how bad the economy is, don\u2019t they? Maybe they\u2019ve reduced the prices. Or got a special offer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true. And maybe he won\u2019t order very much,\u201d I add in sudden inspiration. \u201cI mean, he\u2019s sporty. He won\u2019t be a big eater.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course he won\u2019t!\u201d agrees Kate. \u201cHe\u2019ll have, like, one tiny bit of sashimi and some water and dash off. And he definitely won\u2019t drink. Nobody drinks at lunch anymore.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m feeling more positive about this already. Kate\u2019s right. No one drinks at business lunches these days. And we can keep it down to two courses. Or even one. A starter and a nice cup of coffee. What\u2019s wrong with that?</p><p>And, anyway, whatever we eat, it can\u2019t cost that much, can it?</p><p>Oh my God, I think I\u2019m going to faint.</p> <p>Except I can\u2019t, because Clive Hoxton has just asked me to run through the specs of the job again.</p><p>I\u2019m sitting on a transparent chair at a white-clothed table. If I look to my right, I can see the famous giant lobster tank, which has crustaceans of all sorts clambering around on rocks and occasionally being scooped out in a metal net by a man on a ladder. Over to the left is a cage of exotic birds, whose cheeping is mingling with the background whooshing sound from the fountain in the middle of the room.</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d My voice is quite faint. \u201cAs you know, Leonidas Sports has just taken over a Dutch chain...\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m talking on autopilot. My eyes keep darting down to the menu, printed on Plexiglas. Every time I spot a price, I feel a fresh swoop of horror.</p><p>Ceviche of salmon, origami style \u00a334 .</p><p>That\u2019s a starter. A starter .</p><p>Half a dozen oysters \u00a346 .</p><p>There\u2019s no special offer. There\u2019s no sign of any hard times. All around, diners are merrily eating and drinking as if this is all totally normal. Are they all bluffing? Are they all secretly quailing inside? If I stood on a chair and yelled, \u201cIt\u2019s too expensive! I\u2019m not going to take this anymore!\u201d would I start a mass walkout?</p><p>\u201cObviously the board wants a new marketing director who can oversee this expansion...\u201d I have no idea what I\u2019m blabbering about. I\u2019m psyching myself up to peek at the main courses. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Fillet of duck with three-way orange mash \u00a359 .</p><p>My stomach lurches again. I keep doing mental math and reaching three hundred and feeling a bit sick.</p><p>\u201cSome mineral water?\u201d The waiter appears at the table and proffers a blue-tinted Plexiglas square to each of us. \u201cThis is our water menu. If you like a sparkling water, the Chetwyn Glen is rather fun,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt\u2019s filtered through volcanic rock and has a subtle alkalinity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d I force myself to nod intelligently, and the waiter meets my eyes without a flicker. Surely they all get back into the kitchen, collapse against the walls, and start snorting with laughter: \u201cShe paid fifteen quid! For water!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d prefer Pellegrino.\u201d Clive shrugs. He\u2019s a guy in his forties with graying hair, froggy eyes, and a mustache, and he hasn\u2019t smiled once since we sat down.</p><p>\u201cA bottle of each, then?\u201d says the waiter.</p><p>Noooo! Not two bottles of overpriced water!</p><p>\u201cSo, what would you like to eat, Clive?\u201d I smile. \u201cIf you\u2019re in a hurry, we could go straight to main courses...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not in any hurry.\u201d Clive gives me a suspicious look. \u201cAre you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course not!\u201d I backtrack quickly. \u201cNo hurry at all!\u201d I wave a generous hand. \u201cHave whatever you\u2019d like.\u201d</p><p>Not the oysters, please, please, please not the oysters...</p><p>\u201cThe oysters to begin with,\u201d he says thoughtfully. \u201cThen I\u2019m torn between the lobster and the porcini risotto.\u201d</p><p>I discreetly whip my eyes down to the menu. The lobster is \u00a390; the risotto, only \u00a345.</p><p>\u201cTough choice.\u201d I try to sound casual. \u201cYou know, risotto is always my favorite.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s silence as Clive frowns at the menu again.</p> <p>\u201cI love Italian food,\u201d I throw in with a relaxed little laugh. \u201cAnd I bet the porcini are delicious. But it\u2019s up to you, Clive!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you can\u2019t decide,\u201d the waiter puts in helpfully, \u201cI could bring you both the lobster and a reduced-size risotto.\u201d</p><p>He could what? He could what? Who asked him to interfere, anyway?</p><p>\u201cGreat idea!\u201d My voice is two notes shriller than I intended. \u201cTwo main courses! Why not?\u201d</p><p>I feel the waiter\u2019s sardonic eye on me and instantly know he can read my thoughts. He knows I\u2019m skint.</p><p>\u201cAnd for madam?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Absolutely.\u201d I run a finger down the menu with a thoughtful frown. \u201cThe truth is... I went for a big power breakfast this morning. So I\u2019ll just have a Caesar salad, no starter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne Caesar salad, no starter.\u201d The waiter nods impassively.</p> <p>\u201cAnd would you like to stick to water, Clive?\u201d I desperately try to keep any hint of hope out of my voice. \u201cOr wine...\u201d</p><p>Even the idea of the wine list makes my spine feel all twingey with fear.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see the list.\u201d Clive\u2019s eyes light up.</p><p>\u201cAnd a glass of vintage champagne to start, perhaps,\u201d suggests the waiter, with a bland smile.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t just suggest champagne. He had to suggest vintage champagne. This waiter is a total sadist.</p><p>\u201cI could be persuaded!\u201d Clive gives a sort of lugubrious chuckle, and somehow I force myself to join in.</p><p>At last the waiter departs, having poured us each a zillion-pound glass of vintage champagne. I feel a bit giddy. I\u2019m going to be paying off this lunch for the rest of my life. But it\u2019ll be worth it. I have to believe that.</p><p>\u201cSo!\u201d I say brightly, raising my glass. \u201cTo the job!

Am I going mad? Did Kate take down the message wrong?</p><p>\u201cBut I thought-\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a possibility.\u201d He starts to break up a bread roll. \u201cI\u2019m not happy with my job at the moment, and I\u2019m considering a move. But there are drawbacks to this Leonidas Sports gig too. Sell it to me.\u201d</p><p>For a moment I\u2019m too choked with dismay to answer. I\u2019m spending the price of a small car on this man and he might not even be interested in the job? I take a sip of water, then look up, forcing my most professional smile. I can be Natalie. I can sell this to him.</p><p>\u201cClive. You\u2019re not happy in your current post. For a man with your gifts, this is a criminal situation. Look at you! You should be in a place which will appreciate you.\u201d</p><p>I pause, my heart thumping hard. He\u2019s listening attentively. He hasn\u2019t even buttered his bread roll yet.

She\u2019s back. It\u2019s Sadie, perched on a nearby cheese trolley.</p> <p>She\u2019s not in the green dress anymore; she\u2019s wearing a pale pink one with a dropped waistband and a matching coat over the top. There\u2019s a black band around her head, and from one of her wrists dangles a little gray silk bag on a beaded chain. The other hand is resting on a glass cheese dome-apart from her fingertips, which have sunk into it. She suddenly notices and pulls them out sharply, carefully positioning them on top of the glass.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not terribly handsome, is he?

Are you OK?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, Clive!\u201d I hastily turn back. \u201cJust got a bit distracted there. By the... cheese trolley! It all looks so delicious!\u201d</p><p>Oh God. Clive doesn\u2019t seem amused. I need to get things back on track, quick.</p> <p>\u201cThe real question to ask yourself, Clive, is this.\u201d I lean forward intently. \u201cWill an opportunity like this come along again? It\u2019s a unique chance to work with a great brand, to use all your proven talents and admired leadership skills-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want some champagne!\u201d To my horror, Sadie has materialized right in front of me. She reaches for my glass and tries to pick it up, but her hand goes through it. \u201cDrat! I can\u2019t pick it up!\u201d She reaches again, and again, then glares at me crossly. \u201cThis is so irritating!\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it!\u201d I hiss furiously.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d Clive knits his heavy brows.</p><p>\u201cNot you, Clive!

Why aren\u2019t you looking for it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cClive!\u201d I desperately try to focus back on him. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry about that.

Um... so the point is...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t you looked anywhere?\u201d She thrusts her head close to mine. \u201cDon\u2019t you care about finding it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo... what I\u2019m trying to say is...\u201d It\u2019s taking every ounce of willpower to ignore Sadie and not bat her away. \u201cIn my opinion, this job is a great strategic move; it\u2019s a perfect springboard for your future, and furthermore-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to find my necklace!

Stop-\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up and leave me alone!\u201d</p><p>Shit.</p><p>Did that just come out of my mouth?</p><p>From the shell-shocked way Clive\u2019s froggy eyes have widened, I\u2019m guessing the answer is yes. At two neighboring tables, conversations have come to a halt, and I can see our supercilious waiter pausing to watch. The buzz of clashing cutlery and conversation seems to have died away all around. Even the lobsters seem to be lined up at the edge of the tank, watching.</p><p>\u201cClive!\u201d I give a strangled laugh. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean... obviously I wasn\u2019t talking to you... \u201d</p><p>\u201cLara.\u201d Clive fixes me with a hostile gaze. \u201cPlease do me the courtesy of telling me the truth.\u201d</p><p>I can feel my cheeks staining red. \u201cI was just...\u201d I clear my throat desperately.

Please!\u201d I say in panic, but he\u2019s already striding away, between the tables of gawping diners.</p><p>I feel hot and cold as I stare at his empty chair. With a still-shaky hand, I reach for my champagne and take three deep gulps. So that\u2019s that. I\u2019ve fucked up. My best hope is gone.</p><p>And, anyway, what did he mean, I\u2019m \u201cas unprofessional as my partner\u201d? Has he heard about Natalie disappearing off to Goa? Does everyone know?</p><p>\u201cWill the gentleman be returning?\u201d My trance is interrupted by the waiter approaching the table. He\u2019s holding a wooden platter bearing a dish with a silver dome on it.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d I stare at the table, my face burning with humiliation.</p> <p>\u201cShall I return his food to the kitchen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I still have to pay for it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, madam, yes.\u201d He gives me a patronizing smile. \u201cSince it has been ordered, and everything is cooked from fresh-\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll have it.\u201d</p><p>\u201c All of it?\u201d He seems taken aback.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I lift my chin mutinously. \u201cWhy not?

I\u2019ve always thought they looked gross. Close up they look even grosser. But I\u2019m not admitting that.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I say curtly.</p><p>The waiter retreats, and I stare fixedly at the six oysters in front of me. I\u2019m determined to see this stupid lunch out. But there\u2019s a tight pressing feeling behind my cheekbones, and my bottom lip would be trembling if I allowed it.</p><p>\u201cOysters! I adore oysters.\u201d To my disbelief, Sadie appears in front of my eyes again. She sinks into Clive\u2019s vacated chair with a languid sideways movement, looks around, and says, \u201cThis place is rather fun. Is there a cabaret?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t hear you,\u201d I mutter savagely. \u201cI can\u2019t see you. You don\u2019t exist.

I\u2019m talking to thin air. I look like a lunatic. Hastily I reach for a bread roll and start to butter it, avoiding Sadie\u2019s eye.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me.\u201d The woman leans over and smiles at me. \u201cI couldn\u2019t help overhearing your conversation.

Japanese.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to get one.\u201d She\u2019s gazing at my Claire\u2019s Accessories \u00a35.99 earring, awestruck. \u201cWhere do they sell them?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cActually, this is a prototype,\u201d I say hurriedly. \u201cThey\u2019ll be available in a year or so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, how did you get one, then?\u201d She gives me an aggressive look.</p><p>\u201cI... um... know Japanese people. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould I see?\u201d She holds out her hand. \u201cCould you take it out of your ear for a moment? Would you mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA call\u2019s just coming in,\u201d I say hastily. \u201cIt\u2019s vibrating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t see anything.\u201d She\u2019s peering incredulously at my ear.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s very subtle,\u201d I say desperately. \u201cThey\u2019re microvibrations. Er, Hello, Matt? Yes, I can talk.\u201d</p><p>I mime apologies to the woman and reluctantly she returns to her meal. I can see her pointing me out to all her friends.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Sadie\u2019s eyeing me disdainfully. \u201cHow can a telephone be in an earring? It sounds like a riddle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Don\u2019t you start quizzing me too.\u201d I prod an oyster with little enthusiasm.</p><p>\u201cDo you really not know how to eat an oyster?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever eaten one before in my life.\u201d</p><p>Sadie shakes her head disapprovingly. \u201cPick up your fork. The shellfish fork. Go on!\u201d Casting her a suspicious look, I do as she says. \u201cEase it around, make sure it\u2019s detached from the shell... Now give it a squeeze of lemon and pick it up. Like this.\u201d She mimes picking up an oyster, and I copy. \u201cHead back and swallow the whole thing. Bottoms up!\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s like swallowing a piece of jellified sea. Somehow I manage to slurp down the whole thing, grab my glass, and take a swig of champagne.</p> <p>\u201cYou see?\u201d Sadie is watching me greedily. \u201cIsn\u2019t that too delicious?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019s OK,\u201d I say reluctantly. I put my glass down and survey her silently for a moment. She\u2019s reclining on the chair as though she owns the place, one arm flung to the side, her beaded bag dangling down.</p><p>She\u2019s all in my head, I tell myself. My subconscious has invented her.</p><p>Except... my subconscious doesn\u2019t know how to eat an oyster. Does it?</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d She juts out her chin. \u201cWhy are you looking at me like that?\u201d</p><p>My brain is edging very slowly to a conclusion. To the only possible conclusion.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a ghost, aren\u2019t you?\u201d I say at last. \u201cYou\u2019re not a hallucination. You\u2019re a proper, real-live ghost.\u201d</p><p>Sadie gives a remote shrug, as though she\u2019s really not interested in this conversation.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Again, Sadie doesn\u2019t reply. Her head is tilted and she\u2019s examining her fingernails. Maybe she doesn\u2019t want to be a ghost. Well, too bad. She is.</p><p>\u201cYou are a ghost. I know you are. So, what, am I psychic?\u201d</p><p>My head is prickling all over as this revelation hits me. I feel a bit shivery. I can talk to the dead. Me, Lara Lington. I always knew there was something different about me.</p><p>Think of the implications. Think what this means! Maybe I\u2019ll start talking to more ghosts. Lots of ghosts. Oh my God, I could have my own TV show. I could go around the world. I could be famous! I have a sudden vision of myself on a stage, channeling spirits while an audience watches avidly. With a surge of excitement, I lean across the table.</p><p>\u201cDo you know any other dead people you could introduce me to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Sadie folds her arms crossly. \u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you met Marilyn Monroe? Or Elvis? Or... or Princess Diana? What\u2019s she like? Or Mozart!\u201d I feel almost dizzy as possibilities pile into my head. \u201cThis is mind-blowing. You have to describe it!

I don\u2019t want anything else; I won\u2019t ask you for anything else. Just my necklace. I can\u2019t rest without it. I can\u2019t-\u201d She breaks off and looks away as though she can\u2019t finish the sentence. Or doesn\u2019t want to finish it, maybe.</p> <p>I can tell this is a bit of a sensitive area.

Even if it is totally impossible and stupid.</p><p>\u201cSadie.\u201d At last I exhale sharply. \u201cIf I find your necklace for you, will you go away and leave me in peace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFor good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Her eyes are starting to shine.</p><p>I fold my arms sternly. \u201cIf I look for your necklace as hard as I can but can\u2019t find it because it was lost a zillion years ago or, more likely, never existed... will you still go away?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a pause. Sadie looks sulky.</p><p>\u201cIt did exist,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cWill you?\u201d I persist. \u201cBecause I\u2019m not spending all summer on some ridiculous treasure hunt.\u201d</p><p>For a few moments, Sadie glowers at me, clearly trying to think of some put-down. But she can\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cVery well,\u201d she says at last.</p><p>\u201cOK. It\u2019s a deal.\u201d I lift my champagne glass toward her. \u201cHere\u2019s to finding your necklace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, then! Start looking!\u201d She darts her head around impatiently, as though we might start searching right here and now in the restaurant.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t just go randomly looking! We have to be scientific .\u201d I reach into my bag, pull out the necklace sketch, and unfold it. \u201cAll right. Think back. Where did you last have it?\u201d</p><p>FIVE</p><p>Fairside Nursing Home is in a leafy residential road: a redbrick, double-fronted building with net curtains in every single window. I survey it from the other side of the road, then turn to look at Sadie, who has been following me in silence ever since Potters Bar station. She came with me on the tube, but I barely saw her: She spent the whole time flitting along the carriage, looking at people, popping up to ground level and down again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo, that\u2019s where you used to live,\u201d I say with an awkward brightness. \u201cIt\u2019s really nice! Lovely... garden.\u201d I gesture at a couple of mangy shrubs.</p><p>Sadie doesn\u2019t answer. I look up and see a line of tension in her pale jaw. This must be strange for her, coming back here. I wonder how well she remembers it.</p><p>\u201cHey, how old are you, anyway?\u201d I say curiously, as the thought occurs to me. \u201cI mean, I know you\u2019re a hundred and five really. But now. As you are... here.\u201d I gesture at her.</p><p>Sadie looks taken aback by the question. She examines her arms, peers at her dress, and thoughtfully rubs the fabric between her fingers.</p> <p>\u201cTwenty-three,\u201d she says at last. \u201cYes, I think I\u2019m twenty-three.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m doing mental calculations in my head. She was 105 when she died. Which would mean...</p><p>\u201cYou were twenty-three in the year 1927.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d Her face suddenly comes alive. \u201cWe had a pajama party for my birthday. We drank gin fizzes all evening and danced \u2019til the birds started singing... Oh, I miss pajama parties.\u201d She hugs herself. \u201cDo you have many pajama parties?\u201d</p><p>Does a one-night stand count as a pajama party?</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure they\u2019re quite the same-\u201d I break off as a woman\u2019s face glances out of a top-floor window at me. \u201cCome on. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>I head briskly across the road, up the path to the wide front door, and press the security buzzer.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d I call into the grille. \u201cI don\u2019t have an appointment, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s the sound of a key in a lock, and the front door opens. A woman in a blue nurse\u2019s uniform beams at me. She looks in her early thirties, with her hair tied back in a knot, and a plump pale face.</p><p>\u201cCan I help you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. My name\u2019s Lara, and I\u2019m here about a... a former resident.\u201d I glance at Sadie.</p> <p>She\u2019s gone.</p><p>I hurriedly scan the whole front garden-but she\u2019s totally disappeared. Bloody hell. She\u2019s left me in the lurch.</p><p>\u201cA former resident?\u201d The nurse prompts me.</p><p>\u201cOh. Er... Sadie Lancaster?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSadie!\u201d Her face softens. \u201cCome in! I\u2019m Ginny, senior staff nurse.\u201d</p><p>I follow her into a linoleum-floored hall smelling of beeswax and disinfectant. The whole place is quiet, apart from the nurse\u2019s rubber shoes squeaking on the floor and the distant sound of the TV. Through a door I glimpse a couple of old ladies sitting in chairs with crocheted blankets over their knees.</p><p>I\u2019ve never really known any old people. Not really, really old.</p><p>\u201cHello!\u201d I wave nervously at one white-haired lady who is sitting nearby, and her face immediately crumples in distress.</p> <p>Shit.</p><p>\u201cSorry!\u201d I call quietly. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to... er...\u201d</p><p>A nurse comes over to the white-haired lady, and in slight relief I hurry after Ginny, hoping she didn\u2019t notice.</p><p>\u201cAre you a relation?\u201d she asks, showing me into a little reception room.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Sadie\u2019s great-niece.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLovely!\u201d says the nurse, flicking on the kettle. \u201cCup of tea? We\u2019ve been expecting someone to call, actually. Nobody ever picked up her stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m here about.\u201d I hesitate, gearing myself up. \u201cI\u2019m looking for a necklace which I believe once belonged to Sadie. A glass-bead necklace, with a dragonfly set with rhinestones.\u201d I smile apologetically. \u201cI know it\u2019s a long shot and I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t even-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know the one.\u201d She nods.</p><p>\u201cYou know the one?\u201d I stare at her stupidly. \u201cYou mean... it exists?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe had a few lovely bits.\u201d Ginny smiles. \u201cBut that was her favorite. She wore it over and over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight!\u201d I swallow, trying to keep calm. \u201cCould I possibly see it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be in her box.\u201d Ginny nods again. \u201cIf I can get you to fill in a form first... Do you have any ID?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d I scrabble in my bag, my heart racing. I can\u2019t believe it. This was so easy!</p><p>As I fill in the form, I keep looking around for Sadie, but she\u2019s nowhere to be seen. Where\u2019s she gone? She\u2019s missing the great moment!</p><p>\u201cHere you are.\u201d I thrust the form at Ginny. \u201cSo, can I take it away? I\u2019m nearly next of kin...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe lawyers said the next of kin weren\u2019t interested in having her personal effects,\u201d says Ginny. \u201cHer nephews, was it? We never saw them.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh.\u201d I color. \u201cMy dad.

Apart from the bits of jewelry...\u201d She stops in front of a pin board and gestures fondly at a photo. \u201cHere she is! Here\u2019s our Sadie.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s the same wrinkled old lady from the other photo. She\u2019s wrapped in a pink lacy shawl, and there\u2019s a ribbon in her white candy floss hair. I feel a slight lump in my throat as I gaze at the picture. I just can\u2019t relate this tiny, ancient, folded-up face to Sadie\u2019s proud, elegant profile.</p><p>\u201cHer hundred and fifth birthday, that was.\u201d Ginny points to another photo. \u201cYou know, she\u2019s our oldest ever resident! She\u2019s had telegrams from the queen!\u201d</p> <p>A birthday cake is in front of Sadie in this photo, and nurses are crowding into the picture with cups of tea and wide smiles and party hats. As I look at them, I feel a crawling shame. How come we weren\u2019t there? How come she wasn\u2019t surrounded by me and Mum and Dad and everyone?</p><p>\u201cI wish I\u2019d been there.\u201d I bite my lip. \u201cI mean... I didn\u2019t realize.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s difficult.\u201d Ginny smiles at me without reproach, which of course makes me feel a million times worse. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. She was happy enough. And I\u2019m sure you gave her a wonderful send-off.\u201d</p><p>I think back to Sadie\u2019s miserable, empty little funeral and feel even worse.</p><p>\u201cEr... kind of-Hey!\u201d My attention is suddenly drawn by something in the photograph. \u201cWait! Is that it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s the dragonfly necklace.\u201d Ginny nods easily. \u201cYou can have that photo, if you like.\u201d</p><p>I take down the photo, light-headed with disbelief. There it is. Just visible, poking out of the folds of Great-Aunt Sadie\u2019s shawl. There are the beads. There\u2019s the rhinestone-studded dragonfly. Just as she described it. It\u2019s real!</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry none of us could make the funeral.\u201d Ginny sighs as we resume walking down the corridor. \u201cWe had such staff problems this week. But we toasted her at supper... Here we are! Sadie\u2019s things.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019ve arrived at a small storeroom lined with dusty shelves, and she hands me a shoe box. There\u2019s an old metal-backed hairbrush inside, and a couple of old paperbacks. I can see the gleam of beads coiled up at the bottom.</p><p>\u201cIs this all ?\u201d I\u2019m taken aback, in spite of myself.</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t keep her clothes.\u201d Ginny makes an apologetic gesture. \u201cThey weren\u2019t really hers, so to speak. I mean, she didn\u2019t choose them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut what about stuff from earlier in her life? What about... furniture? Or mementos?\u201d</p><p>Ginny shrugs. \u201cSorry. I\u2019ve only been here five years, and Sadie was a resident for a long while. I suppose things get broken and lost and not replaced.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Trying to hide my shock, I start unpacking the meager things. Someone lives for 105 years and this is all that\u2019s left? A shoe box?</p><p>As I reach the jumble of necklaces and brooches at the bottom, I feel my excitement rising. I untangle all the strings of beads, searching for yellow glass, for a flash of rhinestones, for the dragonfly...</p><p>It\u2019s not there.</p><p>Ignoring a sudden foreboding, I shake the tangle of beads out properly and lay them straight. There are thirteen necklaces in all. None of them is the right one.</p><p>\u201cGinny. I can\u2019t find the dragonfly necklace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh dear!\u201d Ginny peers over my shoulder in concern. \u201cIt should be there!\u201d She lifts up another necklace, made from tiny purple beads, and smiles at it fondly. \u201cThis was another favorite of hers-\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m really after the dragonfly necklace.\u201d I know I sound agitated. \u201cCould it be anywhere else?\u201d</p><p>Ginny looks perplexed. \u201cThis is strange. Let\u2019s check with Harriet. She did the clear-out.\u201d I follow her back down the corridor and through a door marked Staff . Inside is a small, cozy room in which three nurses are sitting on old floral armchairs, drinking cups of tea.</p><p>\u201cHarriet!\u201d says Ginny to a pink-cheeked girl in glasses. \u201cThis is Sadie\u2019s great-niece Lara. She wants that lovely dragonfly necklace that Sadie used to wear. Have you seen it?\u201d</p><p>Oh God. Why did she have to put it like that? I sound like some horrible grasping person out of Scrooge.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want it for me,\u201d I say hastily. \u201cI want it for... a good cause.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t in Sadie\u2019s box,\u201d Ginny explains. \u201cDo you know where it could be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it not?\u201d Harriet looks taken aback. \u201cWell, maybe it wasn\u2019t in the room. Now you mention it, I don\u2019t remember seeing it. I\u2019m sorry, I know I should have taken an inventory. But we cleared that room in a bit of a rush.\u201d She looks up at me defensively. \u201cWe\u2019ve been so stretched...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have any idea where it could have gone?\u201d I look at them helplessly. \u201cCould it have been put somewhere; could it have been given to one of the other residents...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe jumble sale!\u201d pipes up a thin dark-haired nurse sitting in the corner. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t sold by mistake at the jumble sale, was it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat jumble sale?\u201d I swivel around to face her.</p><p>\u201cIt was a fund-raiser, two weekends ago. All the residents and their families donated stuff. There was a bric-a-brac stall with lots of jewelry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I shake my head. \u201cSadie would never have donated this necklace. It was really special to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I say.\u201d The nurse shrugs. \u201cThey were going from room to room. There were boxes of stuff everywhere. Maybe it was collected by mistake.\u201d</p><p>She sounds so matter-of-fact, I suddenly feel livid on Sadie\u2019s behalf.</p> <p>\u201cBut that kind of mistake shouldn\u2019t happen! People\u2019s stuff should be safe! Necklaces shouldn\u2019t just disappear!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe do have a safe in the cellar,\u201d Ginny puts in anxiously. \u201cWe ask residents to keep anything of real value in that. Diamond rings and so forth. If it was valuable, it should really have been locked up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t valuable exactly, I don\u2019t think. It was just... important.\u201d I sit down, rubbing my forehead, trying to organize my thoughts. \u201cSo can we track it down? Do you know who was at this jumble sale?\u201d Doubtful looks are exchanged around the room, and I sigh. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me. You have no idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe do!\u201d The dark-haired nurse suddenly puts down her cup of tea. \u201cHave we still got the raffle list?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe raffle list!\u201d says Ginny, brightening. \u201cOf course! Everyone who came to the sale bought a raffle ticket,\u201d she explains to me. \u201cThey all left their names and addresses in case they won. The star prize was a bottle of Baileys,\u201d she adds proudly. \u201cAnd we had a Yardley gift set-\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have the list?\u201d I cut her off. \u201cCan you give it to me?\u201d</p> <p>Five minutes later I\u2019m clutching a four-page photocopied list of names and addresses. There are sixty-seven in all.</p><p>Sixty-seven possibilities.</p><p>No, possibilities is too strong a word. Sixty-seven outside chances.</p><p>\u201cWell, thanks.\u201d I smile, trying not to feel too daunted. \u201cI\u2019ll investigate this lot. And if you do come across it...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course! We\u2019ll all keep an eye out, won\u2019t we?\u201d Ginny appeals around the room, and there are three nods.</p><p>I follow Ginny back through the hall, and as we approach the front door she hesitates.</p><p>\u201cWe have a visitors\u2019 book, Lara. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019d like to sign it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I hesitate awkwardly. \u201cEr... yes. Why not?\u201d</p> <p>Ginny takes down a big red-bound book and leafs through it.</p><p>\u201cAll the residents have their own page. But Sadie never had very many signatures. So now that you\u2019re here, I thought it would be nice if you signed, even though she\u2019s gone...\u201d Ginny flushes. \u201cIs that silly of me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s sweet of you.\u201d I feel a renewed guilt. \u201cWe should have visited more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere we are.\u201d Ginny\u2019s flipping through the cream pages. \u201cOh, look! She did have one visitor this year! A few weeks ago. I was on holiday, so I missed it.\u201d</p><p>Charles Reece , I read, as I scrawl Lara Lington across the page, nice and big to make up for the lack of other entries. \u201cWho\u2019s Charles Reece?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho knows?\u201d She shrugs.</p><p>Charles Reece. I stare at the name, intrigued. Maybe he was Sadie\u2019s dearest friend from childhood. Or her lover. Oh my God, yes. Maybe he\u2019s a sweet old man with a cane who came to hold his dear Sadie\u2019s hand just one more time. And now he doesn\u2019t even know she\u2019s dead and he wasn\u2019t invited to the funeral...</p><p>We really are a crap family.</p><p>\u201cDid he leave any contact details, this Charles Reece?\u201d I look up. \u201cWas he really old?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.

They\u2019re wonderful, and it was all a terrible mistake, and... well... the thing is...\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m psyching myself up to bite the bullet and admit I invented the whole thing-when suddenly I\u2019m brought up short by a horrible thought. I can\u2019t confess everything. I can\u2019t admit I made the whole thing up. They\u2019ll instantly resume the funeral. I have a flashback to Sadie\u2019s anguished cry at the funeral service, and feel a shiver of anxiety. I can\u2019t let that happen. I just can\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d says the woman patiently.</p><p>\u201cI... um... the thing is...\u201d</p><p>My mind is doing double backflips trying to work out a solution that involves both being honest and buying time for Sadie. But I can\u2019t find one. There isn\u2019t one. And the woman\u2019s going to give up waiting in a minute and put the phone down. I have to say something .</p><p>I need a red herring. Just to distract them for a while. Just while I find the necklace.</p><p>\u201cIt was someone else,\u201d I blurt out. \u201cA... man. It was him I overheard in the pub. I got confused before. He had a plaited goatee beard,\u201d I add randomly. \u201cAnd a scar on his cheek. I remember it really clearly now.\u201d</p><p>They\u2019ll never find a man with a plaited goatee and a scar on his cheek. We\u2019re safe. For now.</p><p>\u201cA man with a plaited beard...\u201d The woman sounds as if she\u2019s trying to keep up.</p><p>\u201cAnd a scar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd, I\u2019m sorry, what is this man supposed to have done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMurdered my great-aunt! I gave a statement, but it was wrong. So if you could just cancel it out...\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There\u2019s a rather long pause-then the woman says, \u201cDear, we don\u2019t just cancel out statements. I think DI James will probably want to talk to you himself.\u201d</p><p>Oh God. The thing is, I really, really don\u2019t want to talk to DI James.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d I try to sound cheery. \u201cNo problem. As long as he knows the nurses definitely didn\u2019t do it. If you could write that message on a Post-it or something? The nurses didn\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe nurses didn\u2019t do it,\u201d she repeats dubiously.</p> <p>\u201cExactly. In big capitals. And put it on his desk.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s another, even longer pause. Then the woman says, \u201cCan I take your name again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLara Lington. He\u2019ll know who I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he will. Well, as I say, Miss Lington, I\u2019m sure DI James will be in touch.\u201d</p><p>I ring off and head down the road, my legs weak. I think I just about got away with it. But, honestly, I\u2019m a nervous wreck.</p> <p>Two hours later, I\u2019m not just a nervous wreck. I\u2019m exhausted.</p><p>In fact, I\u2019m taking a whole new jaded view of the British populace. It might seem like an easy project, phoning a few people on a list and asking if they\u2019d bought a necklace. It might seem simple and straightforward, until you actually tried it yourself.</p><p>I feel like I could write a whole book on human nature, and it would be called: People Are Really Unhelpful . First of all, they want to know how you got their name and phone number. Then, when you mention the word raffle , they want to know what they won and even call out to their husband, \u201cDarren, we won that raffle!\u201d When you hastily tell them, \u201cYou didn\u2019t win anything,\u201d the mood instantly turns suspicious.</p><p>Then, when you broach the subject of what they bought at the jumble sale, they get even more suspicious. They get convinced you\u2019re trying to sell them something or steal their credit card details by telepathy. At the third number I tried, there was some guy in the background saying, \u201cI\u2019ve heard about this. They phone you up and keep you talking. It\u2019s an Internet scam. Put the phone down, Tina.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can it be an Internet scam?\u201d I wanted to yell. \u201cWe\u2019re not on the Internet!\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve only had one woman so far who seemed keen to help: Eileen Roberts. And actually she was a total pain because she kept me on the line for ten minutes, telling me about everything she bought at the jumble sale and saying what a shame it was and had I thought of making a replacement necklace as there was a wonderful bead shop in Bromley?</p> <p>Argh.</p><p>I rub my ear, which is glowing from being pressed against the phone, and count the scribbled-out names on my list. Twenty-three. Forty-four to go. This was a crap idea. I\u2019m never going to find this stupid necklace. I stretch out my back, then fold the list up and put it in my bag. I\u2019ll do the rest tomorrow. Maybe.</p><p>I head into the kitchen, pour myself a glass of wine, and am putting a lasagna in the oven when her voice says, \u201cDid you find my necklace?\u201d I start, crashing my forehead against the oven door, and look up. Sadie\u2019s sitting on the sill of the open window.</p><p>\u201cGive me some warning when you\u2019re going to appear!\u201d I exclaim. \u201cAnd, anyway, where were you? Why did you suddenly abandon me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat place is deathly.\u201d She tosses her chin. \u201cFull of old people. I had to get away.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s speaking lightly, but I can tell she was freaked out by going back there. That must be why she disappeared for so long.</p><p>\u201cYou were old,\u201d I remind her. \u201cYou were the oldest one there. Look, that\u2019s you!\u201d I reach in my jacket pocket and produce the picture of her, all wrinkled and white-haired. I see the briefest of flinches on Sadie\u2019s face before she brushes a scornful glance across the image.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt is! A nurse at the home gave it to me, she said it was you on your hundred and fifth birthday! You should be proud! You got telegrams from the queen and everything-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean, it\u2019s not me . I never felt like that. No one feels like that inside. This is how I felt.\u201d She stretches out her arms. \u201cLike this. A girl in my twenties. All my life. The outside is just... cladding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, anyway, you could have warned me you were leaving. You left me all alone!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo did you get the necklace? Do you have it?\u201d Sadie\u2019s face lights up with hope, and I can\u2019t help wincing.</p><p>\u201cSorry. They had a box of your stuff, but the dragonfly necklace wasn\u2019t in there. Nobody knows where it\u2019s gone. I\u2019m really sorry, Sadie.\u201d</p><p>I brace myself for the tantrum, the banshee screaming... but it doesn\u2019t come. She just flickers slightly, as though someone turned the voltage down. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut I\u2019m on the case,\u201d I add. \u201cI\u2019m calling everyone who came to the jumble sale, in case they bought it. I\u2019ve been on the phone all afternoon. It\u2019s been quite hard work, actually,\u201d I add. \u201cQuite exhausting.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m expecting some gratitude from Sadie at this point. Some nice little speech about how brilliant I am and how appreciative she is of all my effort. But she sighs impatiently and wanders off, through the wall.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d I mouth after her.</p><p>I head into the sitting room and am flicking through the TV channels when she appears again. She seems to have cheered up immensely.</p> <p>\u201cYou live with some very peculiar people! There\u2019s a man upstairs lying on a machine, grunting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I stare at her. \u201cSadie, you can\u2019t spy on my neighbors!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does \u2018shake your booty\u2019 mean?\u201d she says, ignoring me. \u201cThe girl on the wireless was singing it. It sounds like nonsense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means... dance. Let it all out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why your booty?\u201d She still looks puzzled. \u201cDoes it mean wave your shoe?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course not! Your booty is your...\u201d I get up and pat my bum. \u201cYou dance like this.\u201d I do a few \u201cstreet\u201d dance moves, then look up to see Sadie in fits of giggles.</p><p>\u201cYou look as though you\u2019ve got convulsions! That\u2019s not dancing!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s modern dancing.\u201d I glare at her and sit down. I\u2019m a bit sensitive about my dancing, as it happens. I take a gulp of wine and look critically at her. She\u2019s peering at the TV now, watching EastEnders with wide eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEastEnders . It\u2019s a TV show.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are they all so angry with one another?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDunno. They always are.\u201d I take another gulp of wine. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m explaining EastEnders and \u201cshake your booty\u201d to my dead great-aunt. Surely we should be talking about something more meaningful?</p><p>\u201cLook, Sadie... what are you?\u201d I say on impulse, zapping the TV off.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, what am I?\u201d She sounds affronted. \u201cI\u2019m a girl. Just like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA dead girl,\u201d I point out. \u201cSo, not exactly like me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to remind me,\u201d she says frostily.</p><p>I watch as she arranges herself on the edge of the sofa, obviously trying to look natural despite having zero gravity.</p><p>\u201cDo you have any special superhero powers?\u201d I try another tack. \u201cCan you make fire? Or stretch yourself really thin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She seems offended. \u201cAnyway, I am thin.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you have an enemy to vanquish? Like Buffy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Buffy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Vampire Slayer,\u201d I explain. \u201cShe\u2019s on TV; she fights demons and vampires-\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous,\u201d she cuts me off tartly. \u201cVampires don\u2019t exist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, nor do ghosts!\u201d I retort. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not ridiculous! Don\u2019t you know anything? Most ghosts come back to fight the dark forces of evil or lead people to the light or something. They do something positive . Not just sit around watching TV.\u201d</p><p>Sadie shrugs, as though to say, \u201cWhat do I care?\u201d</p><p>I sip my wine, thinking hard. She\u2019s obviously not here to save the world from dark forces. Maybe she\u2019s going to shed light on mankind\u2019s plight or the meaning of life or something like that. Maybe I\u2019m supposed to learn from her.</p><p>\u201cSo, you lived through the whole twentieth century,\u201d I venture. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty amazing. What was... er... Winston Churchill like? Or JFK! Do you think he really was killed by Lee Harvey Oswald?\u201d</p><p>Sadie stares at me as though I\u2019m a moron. \u201cHow would I know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause!\u201d I say defensively. \u201cBecause you\u2019re from history! What was it like living through World War Two?\u201d To my surprise, Sadie looks quite blank.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you remember it?\u201d I say incredulously.</p><p>\u201cOf course I remember it.\u201d She regains her composure. \u201cIt was cold and dreary and one\u2019s friends got killed, and I\u2019d rather not think about it.\u201d</p><p>She speaks crisply-but that little hesitation has pricked my curiosity.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember your whole life?\u201d I ask cautiously.</p><p>She must have memories spanning more than a hundred years. How on earth can she keep hold of them all?</p><p>\u201cIt seems like... a dream,\u201d murmurs Sadie, almost to herself. \u201cSome parts are hazy.\u201d She\u2019s twirling her skirt around one finger, her expression distant. \u201cI remember everything I need to remember,\u201d she says at last. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou choose what to remember,\u201d I offer.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say that.\u201d Her eyes flash with some unfathomable emotion and she wheels away from my gaze. She comes to rest in front of the mantelpiece and peers at a photo of me. It\u2019s a tourist gimmick from Madame Tussauds and shows me grinning next to the waxwork of Brad Pitt.</p><p>\u201cIs this your lover?\u201d She turns around.</p><p>\u201cI wish,\u201d I say sardonically.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have any lovers?\u201d She sounds so pitying, I feel a bit piqued.</p><p>\u201cI had a boyfriend called Josh until a couple of months ago.

I\u2019m single at the moment.\u201d</p><p>Sadie looks at me expectantly. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you take another lover?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I don\u2019t want to just take another lover!\u201d I say, nettled. \u201cI\u2019m not ready!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d She seems perplexed.</p> <p>\u201cBecause I loved him! And it\u2019s been really traumatic! He was my soul mate; we completely chimed-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did he break it off, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I just don\u2019t know! At least, I have this theory...\u201d I trail off, torn. It\u2019s still painful talking about Josh. But, on the other hand, it\u2019s quite a relief to have someone fresh to download to. \u201cOK. Tell me what you think.\u201d I kick off my shoes, sit crosslegged on the sofa, and lean toward Sadie. \u201cWe were in this relationship and it was all going great-\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he handsome?\u201d she interrupts.</p><p>\u201cOf course he\u2019s handsome!\u201d I pull out my phone, find the most flattering picture of him, and tilt it toward her. \u201cHere he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d She makes a so-so gesture with her head.</p> <p>Mmm? Is that the best she can do? I mean, Josh is absolutely, definitively good-looking, and that\u2019s not just me being biased.</p><p>\u201cWe met at this bonfire party. He\u2019s in IT advertising.\u201d I\u2019m scrolling through, showing her other pictures. \u201cWe just clicked, you know how you do? We used to spend all night just talking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow dull.\u201d Sadie wrinkles her nose. \u201cI\u2019d rather spend all night gambling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were getting to know each other,\u201d I say, shooting her an offended look. \u201cLike you do in a relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you go dancing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes!\u201d I say impatiently. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t the point! The point was, we were the perfect match. We talked about everything. We were wrapped up in each other. I honestly thought this was The One. But then...\u201d I pause as my thoughts painfully retread old paths. \u201cWell, two things happened. First of all, there was this time when I... I did the wrong thing. We were walking past a jewelers\u2019 shop and I said, \u2018That\u2019s the ring you can buy me.\u2019 I mean, I was joking . But I think it freaked him out. Then, a couple of weeks later, one of his mates broke up from a long-term relationship. It was like shock waves went through the group. The commitment thing hit them and none of them could cope, so they all ran. All of a sudden Josh was just... backing off. Then he broke up with me, and he wouldn\u2019t even talk about it.\u201d</p><p>I close my eyes as painful memories start resurfacing. It was such a shock. He dumped me by email. By email .</p><p>\u201cThe thing is, I know he still cares about me.\u201d I bite my lip. \u201cI mean, the very fact he won\u2019t talk proves it! He\u2019s scared, or he\u2019s running away, or there\u2019s some other reason I don\u2019t know about... But I feel so powerless.\u201d I feel the tears brimming in my eyes. \u201cHow am I supposed to fix it if he won\u2019t discuss it? How can I make things better if I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s thinking? I mean, what do you think?\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s silence. I look up to see Sadie sitting with her eyes closed, humming softly.</p><p>\u201cSadie? Sadie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d She blinks at me. \u201cSorry. I do tend to go into a trance when people are droning on.\u201d</p><p>Droning on?</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t \u2018droning on\u2019!\u201d I say with indignation. \u201cI was telling you about my relationship!\u201d</p><p>Sadie is surveying me with fascination.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re terribly serious , aren\u2019t you?\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not,\u201d I say at once, defensively. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I was your age, if a boy behaved badly, one simply scored his name out from one\u2019s dance card.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, well.\u201d I try not to sound too patronizing. \u201cThis is all a bit more serious than dance cards. We do a bit more than dance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy best friend, Bunty, was treated terribly badly by a boy named Christopher one New Year. In a taxi, you know.\u201d Sadie widens her eyes. \u201cBut she had a little weep, powdered her nose again, and tally-ho! She was engaged before Easter!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTally-ho?\u201d I can\u2019t keep the scorn out of my voice. \u201cThat\u2019s your attitude toward men?

Do you mean being committed to a mental asylum?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo!\u201d I try to keep my patience. \u201cI mean... Look, were you ever married?\u201d</p><p>Sadie shrugs. \u201cI was married for a spell. We had too many arguments. So wearing, and one begins to wonder why one ever liked the chap in the first place. So I left him. I went abroad, to the Orient. That was in 1933. He divorced me during the war. Cited me for adultery,\u201d she adds gaily, \u201cbut everyone was too distracted to think about the scandal by then.\u201d</p><p>In the kitchen, the oven pings to tell me my lasagna\u2019s ready. I wander through, my head buzzing with all this new information. Sadie was divorced. She played around. She lived in \u201cthe Orient,\u201d wherever that\u2019s supposed to be.</p><p>\u201cD\u2019you mean Asia?\u201d I hoick out my lasagna and tip some salad onto my plate. \u201cBecause that\u2019s what we call it these days. And, by the way, we work at our relationships.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWork?\u201d Sadie appears beside me, wrinkling her nose. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound like any fun. Maybe that\u2019s why you broke up.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t!\u201d I feel like slapping her, she\u2019s so annoying. She doesn\u2019t understand anything.</p><p>\u201cCount On Us,\u201d she reads off my lasagna packet. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means it\u2019s low fat,\u201d I say, a little reluctantly, expecting the usual lecture that Mum gives me about processed diet foods and how I\u2019m a perfectly normal size and girls these days are far too obsessed about weight.</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019re on a diet.\u201d Sadie\u2019s eyes light up. \u201cYou should do the Hollywood diet. You eat nothing but eight grapefruit a day, black coffee, and a hard-boiled egg. And plenty of cigarettes. I did it for a month and the weight fell off me. A girl in my village swore she took tapeworm pills,\u201d she adds reminiscently. \u201cBut she wouldn\u2019t tell us where she got them.\u201d</p><p>I stare at her, feeling a bit revolted. \u201cTapeworms?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey gobble up all the food inside one, you know. Marvelous idea.\u201d</p> <p>I sit down and look at my lasagna, but I\u2019m not hungry anymore. Partly because visions of tapeworms are now lodged in my mind. And partly because I haven\u2019t talked about Josh so openly for ages. I feel all churned up and frustrated.</p><p>\u201cIf I could just talk to him.\u201d I spear a piece of cucumber and stare at it miserably. \u201cIf I could just get inside his head. But he won\u2019t accept my calls, he won\u2019t meet up-\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore talking?\u201d Sadie looks appalled. \u201cHow are you going to forget him if you keep talking about him? Darling, when things go wrong in life, this is what you do.\u201d She adopts a knowledgeable tone. \u201cYou lift your chin, put on a ravishing smile, mix yourself a little cocktail-and out you go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not as simple as that,\u201d I say resentfully. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want to forget about him. Some of us have hearts, you know. Some of us don\u2019t give up on true love. Some of us...\u201d</p><p>I suddenly notice Sadie\u2019s eyes have closed and she\u2019s humming again.</p><p>Trust me to get haunted by the flakiest ghost in the world. One minute shrieking in my ear, the next making outrageous comments, the next spying on my neighbors... I take a mouthful of lasagna and chew it crossly. I wonder what else she saw in my neighbors\u2019 flats. Maybe I could get her to spy on that guy upstairs when he\u2019s making a racket, see what he\u2019s actually doing-</p><p>Wait.</p><p>Oh my God.</p> <p>I nearly choke on my food. With no warning, a new idea has flashed into my mind. A fully formed, totally brilliant plan. The plan that will solve everything.</p><p>Sadie could spy on Josh .</p><p>She could get into his flat. She could listen to his conversations. She could find out what he thinks about everything and tell me, and somehow I could work out what the problem is between us and solve it.</p><p>This is the answer. This is it. This is why she was sent to me.</p><p>\u201cSadie!\u201d I leap to my feet, powered by a kind of giddy adrenaline. \u201cI\u2019ve worked it out! I know why you\u2019re here! It\u2019s to get me and Josh back together!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not,\u201d Sadie objects at once. \u201cIt\u2019s to get my necklace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be here just for some crummy old necklace.\u201d I make a brushing-aside gesture. \u201cMaybe the real reason is you\u2019re supposed to help me! That\u2019s why you were sent!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t sent!\u201d Sadie appears mortally offended at the very idea. \u201cAnd my necklace isn\u2019t crummy!

I bet you\u2019re my guardian angel.\u201d I\u2019m getting carried away here. \u201cI bet you\u2019ve been sent back to earth to show me that actually my life is wonderful, like in that movie.\u201d</p><p>Sadie looks at me silently for a moment, then surveys the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think your life\u2019s wonderful,\u201d she says. \u201cI think it\u2019s rather drab. And your haircut\u2019s atrocious.\u201d</p> <p>I glare at her furiously. \u201cYou\u2019re a crap guardian angel!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not your guardian angel!\u201d she shoots back.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d I clutch at my chest determinedly. \u201cI\u2019m getting a very strong psychic feeling that you\u2019re here to help me get back together with Josh. The spirits are telling me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m getting a very strong psychic feeling that I\u2019m not supposed to get you back together with Josh,\u201d she retorts at once. \u201cThe spirits are telling me .\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s got a nerve. What would she know about spirits? Is she the one who can see ghosts?</p> <p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m alive, so I\u2019m boss,\u201d I snap. \u201cAnd I say you\u2019re supposed to help me. Otherwise, maybe I won\u2019t have time to look for your necklace.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t mean to put it quite as bluntly as that. But then, she forced me into it by being so selfish. I mean, honestly. She should want to help her own great-niece.</p><p>Sadie\u2019s eyes flash angrily at me, but I can tell she knows she\u2019s caught out.</p><p>\u201cVery well,\u201d she says at last, and her slim shoulders heave in a huge, put-upon sigh. \u201cIt\u2019s a terrible idea, but I suppose I have no choice. What do you want me to do?\u201d</p><p>SIX</p><p>I haven\u2019t felt as zippy as this for weeks. For months. It\u2019s eight o\u2019clock the next morning, and I feel like a brand-new person! Instead of waking all depressed, with a picture of Josh clutched in my tearstained hand, a bottle of vodka on the floor, and Alanis Morissette playing on a loop...</p> <p>OK. That was only the one time.</p><p>But anyway. Just look at me! Energetic. Refreshed. Straight eyeliner. Crisp stripy top. Ready to face the day and spy on Josh and get him back. I\u2019ve even booked a cab, to be efficient.</p><p>I head into the kitchen to find Sadie sitting at the table in yet another dress. This one is mauve, with panels of tulle and a draping effect at the shoulders.</p><p>\u201cWow!\u201d I can\u2019t help gasping. \u201cHow come you have all these different outfits?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it glorious?\u201d Sadie looks pleased with herself. \u201cAnd it\u2019s very easy, you know. I just imagine myself in a particular frock and it appears on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo was this one of your favorites?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, this belonged to a girl I knew called Cecily.\u201d Sadie smooths down the skirt. \u201cI always coveted it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve pinched another girl\u2019s outfit?\u201d I can\u2019t help giggling. \u201cYou\u2019ve stolen it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI haven\u2019t stolen it,\u201d she says coldly. \u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d I can\u2019t resist needling her. \u201cWhat if she\u2019s a ghost too and she wants to wear it today and she can\u2019t? What if she\u2019s sitting somewhere, crying her eyes out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not how it works,\u201d says Sadie stonily.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know what works? How do you know-\u201d I break off as a sudden brilliant thought hits me. \u201cHey! I\u2019ve got it! You should just imagine your necklace. Just picture it in your head and then you\u2019ll have it. Quickly, close your eyes, think hard-\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you always this slow-witted?\u201d Sadie interrupts. \u201cI\u2019ve tried that. I tried to imagine my rabbit-fur cape and dancing shoes as well, but I couldn\u2019t get them. I don\u2019t know why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you can only wear ghost clothes,\u201d I say after a moment\u2019s consideration. \u201cClothes that are dead too. Like, that have been shredded up or destroyed or whatever.\u201d</p><p>We both look at the mauve dress for a few moments. It seems sad to think of it being shredded up; in fact, I wish I hadn\u2019t mentioned it.</p><p>\u201cSo, are you all set?\u201d I change the subject. \u201cIf we go soon, we can catch Josh before he leaves for work.\u201d I take a yogurt out of the fridge and start spooning it into my mouth. Just the thought of being near Josh again is making me feel fizzy. I can\u2019t even finish my yogurt, I\u2019m so excited. I put the half-eaten pot back in the fridge and dump the spoon in the sink. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCome on.

Are you ready? The taxi\u2019ll be here in a minute.\u201d The buzzer goes and I lift the receiver.</p> <p>\u201cHi! I\u2019m just coming down-\u201d</p><p>\u201cLara?\u201d comes a familiar muffled voice. \u201cDarling, it\u2019s Dad. And Mum. Just popped round to check you\u2019re all right. We thought we\u2019d catch you before work.\u201d</p><p>I stare at the speakerphone in disbelief. Dad and Mum? Of all the times. And what\u2019s all this with the \u201cpopping round,\u201d anyway? Mum and Dad never \u201cpop round.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm... great!\u201d I try to sound breezy. \u201cI\u2019ll be right down!\u201d</p><p>I emerge from my building to find Mum and Dad standing on the pavement. Mum is holding a potted plant and Dad is clutching a full Holland &amp; Barrett bag, and they\u2019re talking in low voices. As they see me, they come forward with fake smiles as though I\u2019m a mental patient.</p> <p>\u201cLara, darling.\u201d I can see Dad\u2019s worried eyes scanning my face. \u201cYou haven\u2019t replied to any of my texts or messages. We were getting worried!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right. Sorry. I\u2019ve been a bit busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened at the police station, darling?\u201d asks Mum, attempting to sound relaxed.</p><p>\u201cIt was fine. I gave them a statement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Michael.\u201d Mum closes her eyes in despair.</p><p>\u201cSo you really believe Great-Aunt Sadie was murdered?\u201d I can tell Dad is as freaked out as Mum.</p> <p>\u201cLook, Dad, it\u2019s no big deal,\u201d I say reassuringly. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about me.\u201d</p><p>Mum\u2019s eyes snap open. \u201cVitamins,\u201d she says, and starts rooting in the Holland &amp; Barrett bag. \u201cI asked the lady at the shop about... behavioral-\u201d She stops herself. \u201cAnd lavender oil... and a plant can help with stress-you could talk to it!\u201d</p><p>She tries to give me the potted plant, and I thrust it away again impatiently.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want a plant! I\u2019ll forget to water it and it\u2019ll die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to have the plant,\u201d says Dad in soothing tones, glancing warningly at Mum. \u201cBut you\u2019ve obviously been very stressed, what with the new business... and Josh...\u201d</p><p>They are so going to change their tune. They are so going to realize I was right all along, when Josh and I get back together and get married. Not that I can say this right now, obviously.</p><p>\u201cDad.\u201d I give him a patient, reasonable smile. \u201cI told you, I don\u2019t even think about Josh anymore. I\u2019m just getting on with life. It\u2019s you who keeps bringing him up.\u201d</p><p>Ha. That was quite clever. I\u2019m just about to tell Dad that maybe he\u2019s obsessed with Josh, when a taxi pulls up beside us on the pavement and a driver leans out.</p> <p>\u201cThirty-two Bickenhall Mansions?\u201d</p><p>Damn. OK, I\u2019ll just pretend I didn\u2019t hear him.</p><p>Mum and Dad are exchanging looks. \u201cIsn\u2019t that where Josh lives?\u201d says Mum tentatively.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember,\u201d I say carelessly. \u201cAnyway, it\u2019s for someone else-\u201d</p><p>\u201cThirty-two Bickenhall Mansions?\u201d The driver has leaned farther out of his cab, his voice raised higher. \u201cLara Lington? You book taxi?\u201d</p><p>Bugger.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you going to Josh\u2019s flat?\u201d Mum sounds beside herself.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m... not!\u201d I flounder. \u201cIt must be some car I booked months ago, finally turning up! They\u2019re always late. You\u2019re six months late! Go away!\u201d I shoo at the bemused driver, who eventually puts the car into gear and drives away.</p><p>There\u2019s a kind of tense silence. Dad\u2019s expression is so transparent it\u2019s endearing. He wants to believe the best of me. On the other hand, the evidence is all pointing one way.</p><p>\u201cLara, do you swear that taxi wasn\u2019t for you?\u201d he says at last.</p><p>\u201cI swear.\u201d I nod. \u201cOn... Great-Aunt Sadie\u2019s life.\u201d</p><p>I hear a gasp and look around to see Sadie\u2019s eyes beaming fury at me.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t think of anything else!\u201d I say defensively. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sadie ignores me and walks right up to Dad. \u201cYou\u2019re fools,\u201d she says emphatically. \u201cShe\u2019s still smitten with Josh.

In fact... I was actually thinking about poor Great-Aunt Sadie.\u201d I sigh, shaking my head pityingly. \u201cShe had such sad little twiggy arms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not twiggy!\u201d Sadie glares back.</p> <p>\u201cShe probably thought they were really attractive. Talk about deluded!\u201d I laugh gaily. \u201cWho wants pipe cleaners for arms?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho wants pillows for arms?\u201d Sadie shoots back, and I gasp in outrage.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not pillows!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLara...\u201d says Dad faintly. \u201cWhat\u2019s not pillows?\u201d</p><p>Mum looks like she wants to cry. She\u2019s still clutching on to her potted plant and a book entitled Stress-Free Living: You CAN Achieve It .</p><p>\u201cAnyway, I have to get to work.\u201d I give Mum a huge hug. \u201cIt\u2019s been brilliant to see you. And I\u2019ll read your book and take some vitamins. And I\u2019ll see you soon, Dad.\u201d I hug him too. \u201cDon\u2019t worry!\u201d</p> <p>I blow them both kisses and hurry off along the pavement. When I reach the corner, I turn to wave-and they\u2019re both still standing there like waxworks.</p><p>I do feel sorry for my parents, I really do. Maybe I\u2019ll buy them a box of chocolates.</p><p>Twenty minutes later I\u2019m standing outside Josh\u2019s building, feeling bubbly with exhilaration. Everything\u2019s going according to plan. I\u2019ve located his window and explained the layout of the flat. Now it\u2019s up to Sadie.</p><p>\u201cGo on!\u201d I say excitedly. \u201cWalk through the wall! This is so cool!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need to walk through the wall.\u201d She shoots me a disparaging look. \u201cI\u2019ll simply imagine myself inside his flat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK. Well... good luck. Try to find out as much as you can. And be careful!\u201d</p><p>Sadie disappears, and I crane my neck to survey Josh\u2019s window, but I can\u2019t see anything. I feel almost sick with anticipation. This is the nearest I\u2019ve been to Josh in weeks. He\u2019s in there right now. And Sadie\u2019s watching him. And any minute she\u2019ll come out and-</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not there.\u201d Sadie appears in front of me.</p> <p>\u201cNot there?\u201d I stare at her, affronted. \u201cWell, where is he? He doesn\u2019t usually leave for work \u2019til nine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve no idea.\u201d She doesn\u2019t sound remotely interested.</p><p>\u201cWhat did the place look like?\u201d I can\u2019t help probing for details. \u201cIs it a real mess? Like, with old abandoned pizza boxes and beer bottles everywhere? Like he\u2019s been letting himself go? Like he doesn\u2019t really care about life anymore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s very tidy. Lots of fruit in the kitchen,\u201d Sadie adds. \u201cI noticed that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Well, he\u2019s obviously taking care of himself, then.\u201d I hunch my shoulders, a bit discouraged. It\u2019s not that I want Josh to be an emotional wreck on the brink of meltdown, exactly, but...</p><p>Well. You know. It would be quite flattering.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Sadie yawns. \u201cI\u2019ve had enough of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not just leaving! Go in again! Look around for clues! Like... are there any photographs of me or anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d says Sadie at once. \u201cNone. Not a single one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t even looked.\u201d I glare at her resentfully. \u201cSearch on his desk. Maybe he\u2019s in the middle of writing a letter to me or something. Go on!\u201d Without thinking, I try to push her toward the building, but my hands sink straight through her body.</p><p>\u201cUrgh!\u201d I recoil, feeling squeamish.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do that!\u201d she exclaims.</p><p>\u201cDid it... hurt?\u201d I can\u2019t help glancing at my hands, as though they really have just plunged through her innards.</p><p>\u201cNot exactly,\u201d she says grudgingly. \u201cBut it\u2019s not pleasant to have someone\u2019s hands poking through my stomach.\u201d</p><p>She whisks off again. I try to damp down my agitation and wait patiently. But this is totally unbearable, being stuck outside. If it were me searching, I\u2019d find something, I know I would. Like a diary full of Josh\u2019s thoughts. Or a half-written email, unsent. Or... or poetry .

It never even crossed my mind.</p><p>In his breakup email, he said he wasn\u2019t going to rush into anything new. He said he had to take time out to think about his whole life . Well, he hasn\u2019t thought for very long, has he? If I was going to think about my whole life, I\u2019d take ages longer than six weeks. I\u2019d take... a year! At least!

They have no idea .</p><p>\u201cDid it say where they\u2019re having lunch?\u201d</p><p>Sadie nods. \u201cBistro Martin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBistro Martin?\u201d I think I\u2019m going to hyperventilate. \u201cThat\u2019s where we had our first date! We always used to go there!\u201d</p><p>Josh is taking a girl to Bistro Martin. A girl called Marie.</p> <p>\u201cGo in again.\u201d I wave my hands agitatedly at the building. \u201cSearch around! Find out more!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going in again!\u201d objects Sadie. \u201cYou\u2019ve found out all you need to know.\u201d</p><p>Actually, she has a point.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d Abruptly, I turn and start walking away from the flat, so preoccupied that I nearly bump into an old man. \u201cYes, you\u2019re right. I know which restaurant they\u2019re going to be at, and what time; I\u2019ll just go along and see for myself-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Sadie appears in front of me, and I stop in surprise. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant! You can\u2019t be intending to spy on them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to.\u201d I look at her, perplexed. \u201cHow else am I going to find out if Marie\u2019s his new girlfriend or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t find out. You say, \u2018Good riddance,\u2019 buy a new dress, and take another lover. Or several.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want several lovers,\u201d I say mulishly. \u201cI want Josh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you can\u2019t have him! Give up!\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m so, so, so sick of people telling me to give up on Josh. My parents, Natalie, that old woman I got talking to on the bus once...</p><p>\u201cWhy should I give up?\u201d My words fly out on a swell of protest. \u201cWhy does everyone keep telling me to give up? What\u2019s wrong with sticking to one single goal? In every other area of life, perseverance is encouraged! It\u2019s rewarded! I mean, they didn\u2019t tell Edison to give up on lightbulbs, did they? They didn\u2019t tell Scott to forget about the South Pole! They didn\u2019t say, \u2018Never mind, Scotty, there are plenty more snowy wastes out there.\u2019 He kept trying. He refused to give up, however hard it got. And he made it!\u201d</p><p>I feel quite stirred up as I finish, but Sadie is peering at me as though I\u2019m an imbecile.</p><p>\u201cScott didn\u2019t make it,\u201d she says. \u201cHe froze to death.\u201d</p><p>I glare at her resentfully. Some people are just so negative.</p><p>\u201cWell, anyway.\u201d I turn on my heel and start stumping along the street. \u201cI\u2019m going to that lunch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe worst thing a girl can do is trail after a boy when a love affair is dead,\u201d Sadie says disdainfully. I stump faster, but she has no problem keeping up with me. \u201cThere was a girl called Polly in my village -frightful trailer. She was convinced this chap Desmond was still in love with her and followed him around everywhere. So we played the most ripping joke on her. We told her that Desmond was in the garden, hiding behind a bush as he was too shy to talk to her directly. Then, when she came out, one of the boys read out a love letter, supposed to be from him. We\u2019d written it ourselves, you know. Everyone was hiding behind the bushes, simply rocking.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I can\u2019t help feeling a reluctant interest in her story.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t the other guy sound different?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said his voice was high from nerves.

Then my friend Bunty rolled out onto the grass, she was laughing so hard, and the game was up. Poor Polly.\u201d Sadie gives a sudden giggle. \u201cShe was foaming. She didn\u2019t speak to any of us all summer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not surprised!\u201d I exclaim. \u201cI think you were all really cruel! And, anyway, what if their love affair wasn\u2019t dead? What if you ruined her chance of true love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue love!\u201d echoes Sadie with a derisive laugh. \u201cYou\u2019re so old-fashioned!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOld-fashioned?\u201d I echo incredulously.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just like my grandmother, with your love songs and your sighing. You even have a little miniature of your beloved in your handbag, don\u2019t you? Don\u2019t deny it! I\u2019ve seen you looking at it.\u201d</p><p>It takes me a moment to work out what she\u2019s talking about.</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t a miniature, actually. It\u2019s called a mobile phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever it\u2019s called. You still look at it and make goo-goo eyes and then you take your smelling salts out of that little bottle-\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Rescue Remedy!\u201d I say furiously. God, she\u2019s starting to wind me up. \u201cSo you don\u2019t believe in love, is that what you\u2019re saying? You weren\u2019t ever in love? Not even when you were married?\u201d</p><p>A passing postman shoots me a curious look, and I hastily put a hand to my ear as though adjusting an earpiece. I must start wearing one as camouflage.</p><p>Sadie hasn\u2019t answered me, and as we reach the tube station I stop dead to survey her, suddenly genuinely curious. \u201cYou were really never in love?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s the briefest pause, then Sadie flings her arms out with a rattle of bracelets, her head thrown back. \u201cI had fun. That\u2019s what I believe in. Fun, flings, the sizzle...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat sizzle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what we called it, Bunty and I.\u201d Her mouth curves in a reminiscent smile. \u201cIt starts as a shiver, when you see a man for the first time. And then he meets your eye and the shiver runs down your back and becomes a sizzle in your stomach and you think I want to dance with that man .\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then what happens?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou dance, you have a cocktail or two, you flirt...\u201d Her eyes are shining.</p><p>\u201cDo you-\u201d</p><p>I want to ask, \u201cDo you shag him?\u201d but I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s the kind of question you ask your 105-year-old great-aunt. Then I remember the visitor from the nursing home.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d I raise my eyebrows. \u201cYou can say what you like, but I know there was someone special in your life.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d She stares at me, suddenly tense. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA certain gentleman by the name of... Charles Reece?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m hoping to provoke a blush or gasp or something, but she looks blank.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never heard of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharles Reece! He came to visit you in the nursing home? A few weeks ago?\u201d</p><p>Sadie shakes her head. \u201cI don\u2019t remember.\u201d The light in her eyes fades as she adds, \u201cI don\u2019t remember much about that place at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose you wouldn\u2019t...\u201d I pause awkwardly. \u201cYou had a stroke, years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She glares at me.</p><p>God, she doesn\u2019t have to be so touchy. It\u2019s not my fault. Suddenly I realize my phone is vibrating. I pull it out of my pocket and see that it\u2019s Kate.</p><p>\u201cHi, Kate!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLara? Hi! Um, I was wondering... are you coming into work today? Or not?\u201d she adds quickly, as though she might have offended me by asking. \u201cI mean, either way is great, everything\u2019s fine...\u201d</p><p>Shit. I\u2019ve been so absorbed in Josh, I\u2019d almost forgotten about work.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on my way in,\u201d I say hastily. \u201cI was just doing a bit of... er... research at home. Is anything up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Shireen. She wants to know what you\u2019ve done about her dog. She sounded quite upset. In fact, she was talking about pulling out of the job.\u201d</p><p>Oh God. I haven\u2019t even thought about Shireen and her dog. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCould you phone her back and say I\u2019m on the case and I\u2019ll call her really soon?

I need to reorder my priorities. I need to realize what\u2019s important in life.</p><p>I\u2019ll leave Josh until the weekend.</p><p>\u201cWe have to go.\u201d I reach for my Oyster card and start hurrying toward the tube. \u201cI\u2019ve got a problem.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnother man problem?\u201d asks Sadie, wafting effortlessly along beside me.</p><p>\u201cNo, a dog problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA dog?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my client.\u201d I march down the tube steps. \u201cShe wants to take her dog to work, and they\u2019re saying no, it\u2019s not allowed, but she\u2019s convinced there\u2019s another dog in the building.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause she heard barking, more than once. But, I mean, what am I supposed to do about it?\u201d I\u2019m almost talking to myself now. \u201cI\u2019m totally stuck. The human-resources department is denying there\u2019s any other dog, and there\u2019s no way to prove they\u2019re lying. I can\u2019t exactly get into the building and search every office-\u201d</p><p>I stop in surprise as Sadie appears right in front of me.</p><p>\u201cMaybe not.\u201d Her eyes sparkle. \u201cBut I can.\u201d</p><p>SEVEN</p><p>Macrosant is housed in a massive block on Kingsway, with big steps and a steel globe sculpture and plate-glass windows. From the Costa Coffee across the road, I have a pretty good view of it.</p><p>\u201cAnything doglike,\u201d I\u2019m instructing Sadie, behind an open copy of the Evening Standard . \u201cThe sound of barking, baskets under desks, dog toys...\u201d I take a sip of cappuccino. \u201cI\u2019ll stay here. And thanks!\u201d</p> <p>The building\u2019s so massive, I could be waiting here awhile. I flick through my Evening Standard and slowly nibble my way through a chocolate brownie, and I\u2019ve just ordered a fresh cappuccino when Sadie materializes in front of me. Her cheeks are flushed and her eyes are shining and she\u2019s glowing all over. I pull out my mobile phone, smile at the girl at the next table, and pretend to dial a number.</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d I say into the phone. \u201cDid you find a dog?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that,\u201d Sadie says, as though she\u2019d forgotten all about it. \u201cYes, there\u2019s a dog, but guess what-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d I cut her off in excitement. \u201cWhere\u2019s the dog?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUp there.\u201d She gestures. \u201cIn a basket under a desk. It\u2019s the dearest little Pekingese-\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you get a name? An office number? Anything like that? Thank you!\u201d</p><p>She vanishes and I sip my new cappuccino, hugging myself. Shireen was right all along! Jean lied to me! Wait until I get on the phone with her. Just wait. I\u2019m going to demand a full apology and full office rights for Flash and maybe a new dog basket as a goodwill gesture...</p><p>I glance through the window and suddenly spot Sadie drifting along the pavement, back toward the coffee shop. I feel a tiny spike of frustration. She doesn\u2019t seem in any hurry at all. Doesn\u2019t she realize how important this is?</p> <p>I\u2019m ready with my mobile out as soon as she enters. \u201cEverything OK?\u201d I demand. \u201cDid you find the dog again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she says vaguely. \u201cYes, the dog. It\u2019s on floor fourteen, room 1416, and its owner is Jane Frenshew. I\u2019ve just met the most delicious man.\u201d She hugs herself.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, you\u2019ve met a man?\u201d I\u2019m scribbling it all quickly on a piece of paper. \u201cYou can\u2019t meet a man. You\u2019re dead. Unless-\u201d I look up with a sudden thrill. \u201cOoh. Have you met another ghost?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not a ghost.\u201d She shakes her head impatiently. \u201cBut he\u2019s divine. He was talking in one of the rooms I walked through. Just like Rudolph Valentino.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d I say blankly.</p><p>\u201cThe film star, of course! Tall and dark and dashing. Instant sizzle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds lovely,\u201d I say absently.</p><p>\u201cAnd he\u2019s just the right height,\u201d Sadie continues, swinging her legs on a bar stool. \u201cI measured myself against him. My head would rest on his shoulder perfectly if we went dancing together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d I finish writing, grab my bag, and stand up. \u201cOK. I need to get back to the office and sort this out.\u201d</p><p>I head out of the door and start hurrying toward the tube, but to my surprise Sadie blocks my way.</p><p>\u201cI want him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d I peer at her, flicking my mobile open out of habit. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe man I just met.

All those years, trapped in an old woman\u2019s body. In a place with no music, with no life...\u201d</p><p>I feel a rub of guilt inside as I remember the picture of Sadie, ancient and wrinkled in her pink shawl.</p><p>\u201cOK,\u201d I say quickly. \u201cFair enough. So, let\u2019s dance at home. We\u2019ll put on some music, dim the lights, have a little party-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to dance at home to the wireless!\u201d she says scornfully. \u201cI want to go out with a man and enjoy myself!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to go on a date,\u201d I say disbelievingly, and her eyes light up.</p> <p>\u201cYes! Exactly! A date with a man. With him.\u201d She points at the building.</p><p>What exactly is it about being a ghost that she doesn\u2019t understand?</p><p>\u201cSadie, you\u2019re dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know!\u201d she says in irritation. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to keep reminding me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you can\u2019t go on a date. Sorry. That\u2019s the way it is.\u201d I shrug and start walking on again. Two seconds later, Sadie lands in front of me once more, her jaw set.</p><p>\u201cAsk him for me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do it on my own.\u201d Her voice is fast and determined. \u201cI need a go-between. If you go out with him on a date, I can go out with him on a date. If you dance with him, I can dance with him too.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s serious. I almost want to burst out laughing.</p><p>\u201cYou want me to go on a date for you,\u201d I say, to clarify. \u201cWith some random guy I don\u2019t know. So you can have a dance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just want one last little burst of fun with a handsome man while I still have the chance.\u201d Sadie\u2019s head falls forward and her mouth pouts into the sad little O shape again. \u201cOne more whirl around a dance floor. That\u2019s all I ask before I disappear from this world.\u201d Her voice descends to a low, pitiful whisper. \u201cIt\u2019s my last desire. My final wish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your final wish!\u201d I say, a bit indignantly. \u201cYou\u2019ve already had your final wish! It was searching for your necklace, remember?\u201d</p><p>For an instant Sadie looks caught out.</p><p>\u201cThis is my other final wish,\u201d she says at last.</p> <p>\u201cLook, Sadie.\u201d I try to sound reasonable. \u201cI can\u2019t just ask a stranger on a date. You\u2019ll have to do without this one. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>Sadie is surveying me with such a silent, quivering, wounded expression that I wonder if I somehow stepped on her foot.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really saying no,\u201d she says at last, her voice cracking as though with emotion. \u201cYou\u2019re really refusing me. One last innocent wish. One tiny request.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was in that nursing home for years. Never any visitors. Never any laughter. Never any life. Just oldness... and loneliness... and misery...\u201d</p><p>Oh God. She can\u2019t do this to me. It\u2019s not fair.</p><p>\u201cEvery Christmas, all alone, never a visitor... never a present...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t my fault,\u201d I say feebly, but Sadie ignores me.</p><p>\u201cAnd now I see the chance of a sliver of happiness. A morsel of pleasure. Yet my own callous, selfish great-niece-\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK!\u201d I stop in my tracks and rub my forehead. \u201cOK! Whatever! Fine! I\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>Everyone in my life thinks I\u2019m a lunatic anyway. Asking a stranger on a date will make no difference; in fact, my dad will probably be delighted.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an angel!\u201d Sadie\u2019s mood has instantly flipped to giddy excitement. She whirls around on the pavement, the panels on her dress flying out. \u201cI\u2019ll show you where he is! Come on!\u201d</p><p>I follow her toward the massive steps and push my way into the huge double-height foyer. If I\u2019m going to do this, I need to do it very quickly, before I change my mind.</p><p>\u201cSo where is he?\u201d I look around the echoing marble chamber.</p><p>\u201cIn a room upstairs! Come on!\u201d She\u2019s like a puppy straining the leash.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t just walk into an office building!\u201d I hiss back, gesturing at the electronic security barriers. \u201cI need a plan. I need an excuse.

A pair of men in suits stride past, and one of them gives me a curious look. I hold my phone up to my ear to discourage conversation, and follow the men. As we reach the door, one of the men punches in a code.</p> <p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I nod in my most businesslike way and follow them in. \u201cGavin, I\u2019ve told you the European figures don\u2019t make sense,\u201d I say into my phone.</p><p>The taller man hesitates as though he\u2019s going to challenge me. Shit. I hastily increase my speed and walk straight past them.</p><p>\u201cI have a meeting in two minutes, Gavin,\u201d I say hastily. \u201cI want those updated figures on my BlackBerry. Now I have to go and talk about... er... percentages.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a ladies\u2019 room on the left. Trying not to run, I hurry into it and duck into a marble-clad cubicle.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Sadie demands, materializing right in the cubicle with me. Honestly. Does she have no idea of privacy?</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think I\u2019m doing?\u201d I reply under my breath. \u201cWe need to wait a bit.\u201d</p> <p>I sit it out for three minutes, then head out of the ladies\u2019. The two men have disappeared. The corridor is empty and quiet, just a long stretch of pale-gray carpet and occasional water machines and blond-wood doors leading off on either side. I can hear the hum of conversation and occasional small computer sounds.</p><p>\u201cSo where is he?\u201d I turn to Sadie.</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d She\u2019s peering around. \u201cOne of these doors along here...\u201d</p><p>She heads along the corridor and I follow cautiously. This is surreal. What am I doing roaming around a strange office building, looking for a strange man?</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Sadie appears by my side, glowing. \u201cHe\u2019s in there! He has the most penetrating eyes. Absolutely shiversome.\u201d She points to a solid wooden door labeled Room 2012 . There isn\u2019t a window or even a tiny glass panel. I can\u2019t see anything inside.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve just been inside! He\u2019s there! Go on! Ask him!\u201d Her hands are trying to push me.</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d I take a few steps away, trying to think this all through. I can\u2019t just blunder in. I have to make a plan.</p> <p>1) Knock and enter strange guy\u2019s office.</p><p>2) Say hello in natural, pleasant manner.</p><p>3) Ask him out on date.</p><p>4) Almost die of embarrassment as he calls security.</p><p>5) Leave very, very swiftly.</p><p>6) Do not give my name under any circumstances. That way I can run away and blank the whole thing from my memory and nobody will ever know it was me. Maybe he\u2019ll even think he dreamed it.</p><p>The whole thing will take thirty seconds max and then Sadie will have to stop pestering me. OK, let\u2019s get it over with. I approach the door, trying to ignore the fact that my heart is suddenly galloping with nerves. I take a deep breath, raise my hand, and knock gently.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t make any sound!\u201d exclaims Sadie behind me. \u201cKnock harder! Then just walk in. He\u2019s in there! Go on!\u201d</p><p>Squeezing my eyes, I rap sharply, twist the door handle, and take a step inside the room.</p><p>Twenty suited people seated around a conference table all turn to look at me. A man at the far end pauses in his PowerPoint presentation. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I stare back, frozen.</p><p>It\u2019s not an office. It\u2019s a conference room. I\u2019m standing in a company I don\u2019t belong to, in a great big meeting I don\u2019t belong to, and everyone\u2019s waiting for me to speak.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I stammer at last. \u201cI don\u2019t want to interrupt. Carry on.\u201d</p><p>Out of the corner of my eye I\u2019ve noticed a couple of empty seats. Barely knowing what I\u2019m doing, I pull a chair out and sit down. The woman next to me eyes me uncertainly for a moment, then pushes along a pad of paper and pen.</p> <p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I murmur back.</p><p>I don\u2019t quite believe this. No one\u2019s told me to leave. Don\u2019t they realize I don\u2019t belong here? The guy at the front has resumed his speech, and a few people are scribbling notes. Surreptitiously, I look around the table. There are about fifteen men in this room. Sadie\u2019s guy could be any of them. There\u2019s a sandy-haired guy across the table who looks cute. The man giving the presentation is quite good-looking too. He has wavy dark hair and pale blue eyes and the same tie I bought Josh for his birthday. He\u2019s gesturing at a graph and talking with an animated voice.</p><p>\u201c... and client satisfaction ratings have increased, year-on-year-\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop right there.\u201d A man standing at the window, whom I hadn\u2019t even noticed before, turns around. He has an American accent, a dark suit, and chestnut-colored hair brushed straight back. There\u2019s a deep V-shaped frown between his eyebrows, and he\u2019s looking at the wavy-haired guy as though he represents some great personal disappointment to him. \u201cClient satisfaction ratings aren\u2019t what we\u2019re about. I don\u2019t want to perform work that a client rates as an A. I want to perform work that I rate as an A.\u201d</p><p>The man with wavy hair looks wrong-footed, and I feel a stab of sympathy for him.</p> <p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he mumbles.</p><p>\u201cThe emphasis in this room is all wrong.\u201d The American guy frowns around the table. \u201cWe\u2019re not here to perform tactical quick fixes. We should be influencing strategy. Innovating. Since I\u2019ve been over here...\u201d</p><p>I tune out as I notice Sadie sliding into the chair next to me. I scribble WHICH MAN? and push my pad across.</p><p>\u201cThe one who looks like Rudolph Valentino,\u201d she says, as though surprised I even need to ask.</p><p>For God\u2019s sake.</p><p>HOW WOULD I KNOW WHAT BLOODY RUDOLPH VALENTINO LOOKS LIKE? I scribble. WHICH ONE?</p> <p>I\u2019m betting on the wavy-haired man. Unless it\u2019s the blond guy sitting right at the front; he looks quite nice. Or maybe that chap with the goatee?</p><p>\u201cHim, of course!\u201d Sadie points to the other side of the room.</p><p>THE MAN GIVING THE PRESENTATION? I write, just to confirm it.</p><p>\u201cNo, silly!\u201d She giggles. \u201cHim!\u201d She appears in front of the American man with the frown, and gazes at him longingly. \u201cIsn\u2019t he a dove?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHim?\u201d</p><p>Oops. I spoke out loud. Everyone turns to look at me, and I hastily try to sound as though I\u2019m clearing my throat: \u201cHmrrrm hrrrmm.\u201d</p><p>SERIOUSLY, HIM? I write on my pad of paper as she returns to my side.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s delicious!\u201d she says in my ear, sounding affronted.</p> <p>I survey the American guy dubiously, trying to be fair. I suppose he is quite good-looking in that classic preppy way. His hair springs up from a broad, square brow, he has the hint of a tan, and dark wrist hair is visible inside his immaculate white cuffs. And his eyes are penetrating. He\u2019s got that magnetic quality that leaders always seem to have. Strong hands and gestures. As he speaks, he commands attention.</p><p>But honestly. He\u2019s so totally not my sort. Too intense. Too frowny. And everyone else in the room seems terrified of him.</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of which.\u201d He picks up a plastic folder and skims it deftly across the table toward the goatee-beard guy. \u201cLast night I put together some points with regard to the Morris Farquhar consultation. Just a memo. Might help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Goatee-beard guy looks utterly taken aback. \u201cWell... thanks. I appreciate it.\u201d He flips through wonderingly. \u201cCan I use this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the general idea,\u201d says the American guy, with a smile so wry and brief you\u2019d miss it if you blinked. \u201cSo, regarding the final point...\u201d</p><p>From my place at the back, I can see goatee-beard guy leafing through the typed pages, agog. \u201cWhen the hell did he have time to do this?\u201d he mutters to his neighbor, who shrugs.</p><p>\u201cI have to go.\u201d The American guy suddenly consults his watch. \u201cMy apologies for hijacking the meeting. Simon, please continue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have just one question.\u201d The sandy-haired man hurriedly raises his hand. \u201cWhen you\u2019re talking about innovating procedure, do you mean-\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cQuick!\u201d Sadie\u2019s voice suddenly resounds in my ear, making me jump. \u201cAsk him on a date! He\u2019s leaving! You promised! Do it! Do-it-do-it-do-it-\u201d</p><p>OK!!!!!! I scrawl, flinching. JUST GIVE ME A SECOND .</p><p>Sadie stalks to the other side of the room and watches me expectantly. After a while she starts making impatient Come on! gestures with her hands. Mr. American Frown has finished answering the sandy-haired guy and is pushing some papers into his briefcase.</p><p>I can\u2019t do this. It\u2019s ludicrous.</p> <p>\u201cGo on! Go on!\u201d Sadie\u2019s voice blasts my eardrum again. \u201cAsk!\u201d</p><p>Blood is pulsating around my head. My legs are trembling under the table. Somehow I force myself to raise a hand.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d I say in an embarrassed squeak.</p><p>Mr. American Frown turns and surveys me, looking puzzled. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve been introduced. You\u2019ll have to excuse me, I\u2019m in a hurry-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a question.\u201d</p> <p>Everyone around the table has swiveled to look at me. I can see a man whispering \u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d to his neighbor.</p><p>\u201cOK.\u201d He sighs. \u201cOne more quick question. What is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI... um... It\u2019s just... I wanted to ask...\u201d My voice is jumpy and I clear my throat. \u201cWould you like to go out with me?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a stunned silence, apart from someone spluttering on their coffee. My face is boiling hot, but I hold steady. I can see a few astounded looks passing between the people at the table.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d says the American man, looking bewildered.</p><p>\u201cLike... on a date?\u201d I risk a little smile.</p> <p>Suddenly I\u2019m aware of Sadie beside him. \u201cSay yes !\u201d she shrieks into his ear, so loudly that I want to flinch on his behalf. \u201cSay yes! Say yes!\u201d</p><p>To my astonishment, I can see the American man reacting. He\u2019s cocking his head as though he can hear some distant radio signal. Can he hear her?</p><p>\u201cYoung lady,\u201d says a gray-haired man curtly. \u201cThis really isn\u2019t the time or place-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean to interrupt,\u201d I say humbly. \u201cI won\u2019t take up much time. I just need an answer, one way or the other.\u201d I turn to the American man again. \u201cWould you like to go out with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay yes! Say yes!\u201d Sadie\u2019s yelling increases to an unbearable level.</p><p>This is unreal. The American man can definitely hear something. He shakes his head and takes a couple of steps away, but Sadie follows him, still yelling. His eyes are glazed and he looks like he\u2019s in a trance.</p><p>No one else in the room is moving or speaking. They all seem pinioned by shock; one woman has her hand clapped across her face as though she\u2019s watching a train wreck.</p><p>\u201cSay yes!\u201d Sadie\u2019s starting to sound hoarse as she screams. \u201cRight now! Say it! SAY YES!\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s almost comical, the sight of her yelling so hard and only getting the faintest reaction. But as I watch, I only feel pity. She looks so powerless, as though she\u2019s shouting behind a sheet of glass and the only one who can hear her properly is me. Sadie\u2019s world must be so frustrating, I find myself thinking. She can\u2019t touch anything, she can\u2019t communicate with anyone, it\u2019s obvious she\u2019s never going to get through to this guy-</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d The American man nods desperately.</p><p>My pity dies away.</p><p>Yes?</p><p>There\u2019s a gasp all around the table and a hastily stifled giggle. Everyone immediately turns to gape at me, but I\u2019m temporarily too dumbfounded to reply.</p><p>He said yes.</p><p>Does this mean... I actually have to go on a date with him?</p><p>\u201cGreat!\u201d I try to gather my wits. \u201cSo... let\u2019s be in touch, shall we? My name\u2019s Lara Lington, by the way, here\u2019s my card...\u201d I scrabble in my bag.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Ed.\u201d The man still looks dazed. \u201cEd Harrison.\u201d He reaches into his inside pocket and produces his own business card.</p><p>\u201cSo... um... bye, then, Ed!\u201d I pick up my bag and hurriedly beat a retreat, to the sound of a growing hubbub. I can hear someone saying, \u201cWho the bloody hell was that?\u201d and a woman saying in an urgent undertone, \u201cYou see? You just have to have the guts . You have to be direct with men. Stop the games. Lay it out there. If I\u2019d known at her age what that girl knows...\u201d</p><p>What I know?</p><p>I don\u2019t know anything except I need to get out of here.</p><p>EIGHT</p><p>I\u2019m still in a state of shock as Sadie catches up with me, halfway across the ground floor reception lobby. My mind keeps rerunning the scene in total disbelief. Sadie communicated with a man. He actually heard her. I\u2019m not sure how much he heard-but obviously enough. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIsn\u2019t he a peach?\u201d she says dreamily. \u201cI knew he\u2019d say yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat went on in there?\u201d I mutter incredulously. \u201cWhat\u2019s with the shouting? I thought you couldn\u2019t talk to anyone except me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalking\u2019s no good,\u201d she agrees. \u201cBut I\u2019ve noticed that when I really let off a socking great scream right in someone\u2019s ear, most people seem to hear something faint. It\u2019s terribly hard work, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you done this before? Have you spoken to anyone else?\u201d</p> <p>I know it\u2019s ridiculous, but I feel the tiniest bit jealous that she can get through to other people.

I adore the Savoy.\u201d</p><p>My attention is wrenched back to the present situation. She seriously envisages all three of us going on a date together? A weird, freaky, threesome-with-a-ghost date?</p><p>OK, Lara. Stay sane. That guy won\u2019t really claim a date. He\u2019ll tear up my card and blame the incident on his hangover/drug habit/stress levels and I\u2019ll never see him again. Feeling more confident, I stride toward the exit. That\u2019s enough craziness for one day. I have things to do.</p><p>As soon as I get back to the office, I put a call through to Jean, lean back in my swivel chair, and prepare to relish the moment.</p> <p>\u201cJean Savill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, hi, Jean,\u201d I say pleasantly. \u201cIt\u2019s Lara Lington here. I\u2019m just calling about your no-dog policy again, which I totally understand and applaud. I can absolutely see why you\u2019d wish to keep your workplace an animal-free zone. But I was just wondering why this rule doesn\u2019t extend to Jane Frenshew in room 1416?\u201d</p><p>Ha!</p><p>I\u2019ve never heard Jean so squirmy. At first she denies it altogether. Then she tries to say it\u2019s due to special circumstances and doesn\u2019t set any precedent. But it only takes one mention of lawyers and European rights for her to cave in. Shireen can bring Flash to work! It\u2019s going to be put in her contract tomorrow, and they\u2019re throwing in a dog basket! I put down the phone and dial Shireen\u2019s number. She\u2019s going to be so happy! Finally, this job is fun .</p><p>And it\u2019s even more fun when Shireen gasps incredulously over the phone.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t imagine anyone at Sturgis Curtis taking the same trouble,\u201d she keeps saying. \u201cThis is the difference when you work with a smaller outfit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoutique,\u201d I correct her. \u201cWe have the personal touch. Tell all your friends!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will! I\u2019m so impressed!

It was me! You should say, \u2018My marvelous great-aunt Sadie helped me and I\u2019m extremely grateful.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, Natalie would never have bothered tracking down a dog,\u201d says Kate suddenly. \u201cNever. Not in a million years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d My glow dims. Suddenly, looking at the whole thing through Natalie-type business eyes, I feel a little unprofessional. Maybe it was a bit ridiculous, to spend so much time and effort on one dog. \u201cWell, I just wanted to save the situation; it seemed the best way-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t understand.\u201d Kate cuts me off, pink in the face. \u201cI meant it in a good way.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m so taken aback, I don\u2019t know what to say. No one\u2019s ever compared me favorably to Natalie before.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go on a coffee run to celebrate!\u201d Kate says brightly. \u201cDo you want anything?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s OK.\u201d I smile at her. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually...\u201d Kate looks awkward. \u201cI\u2019m a bit ravenous.

You\u2019ll starve!\u201d</p><p>Kate leaps up, bashing her head on an open file drawer, and pulls her bag down off a high shelf.

Don\u2019t you know anything?\u201d</p><p>Sadie\u2019s eyes flash angrily at me, but she turns away and starts examining the blinds cord, as though she wants to analyze every fiber. Then she wanders over to the opposite window. Then she looks at the phone again.</p> <p>I could really do without a lovelorn ghost trailing around my office when I\u2019m trying to work.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go sightseeing?\u201d I suggest. \u201cYou could look at the gherkin building, or go to Harrods...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been to Harrods.\u201d She wrinkles her nose. \u201cIt looks very peculiar these days.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m about to suggest that she go for a long, long walk in Hyde Park, when my mobile trills. Like lightning, Sadie is by my side, watching eagerly as I check the display.</p><p>\u201cIs it him? Is it him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know the number.\u201d I shrug. \u201cCould be anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s him!\u201d She hugs herself. \u201cTell him we want to go to the Savoy for cocktails.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you crazy? I\u2019m not saying that!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis is my date, and I want to go to the Savoy,\u201d she says mulishly.</p><p>\u201cShut up or I won\u2019t answer!\u201d</p><p>We glare at each other as the phone trills again, then Sadie takes a reluctant step backward, her cheeks pouchy.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this Lara?\u201d It\u2019s a woman I don\u2019t recognize.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not him, OK?\u201d I hiss at Sadie. I make a shooing-away motion at her, then turn back to the phone.</p><p>\u201cYes, Lara speaking. Who\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Nina Martin. You left a message about a necklace? At the old folks\u2019 jumble sale?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes!\u201d I\u2019m suddenly alert. \u201cDid you buy one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bought two. Black pearls and a red one. Good condition. I can sell them both to you if you like; I was planning to put them on eBay-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I deflate. \u201cThey\u2019re not what I\u2019m looking for. Thanks, anyway.\u201d</p><p>I take out the list and scribble off Nina Martin\u2019s name while Sadie watches critically.</p><p>\u201cWhy haven\u2019t you tried all the names?\u201d she demands.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll phone some more this evening. I have to work now,\u201d I add at her look. \u201cSorry, but I do.\u201d</p><p>Sadie heaves a huge sigh. \u201cAll this waiting is unbearable.\u201d She swishes over to my desk and stares at the phone. Then she swishes to the window, then back to the phone.</p><p>There\u2019s no way I can sit here all afternoon with her swishing and sighing. I\u2019m going to have to be brutally honest.</p><p>\u201cLook, Sadie.\u201d I wait until she turns. \u201cAbout Ed. You should know the truth. He won\u2019t call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, he won\u2019t call?\u201d Sadie retorts. \u201cOf course he will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t.\u201d I shake my head. \u201cThere\u2019s no way on earth he\u2019s going to call some loony girl who blagged her way into his meeting. He\u2019s going to throw my card away and forget all about it. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>Sadie is staring at me with reproach, as though I\u2019ve deliberately set out to dash all her hopes.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not my fault!\u201d I say defensively. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to let you down lightly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to call,\u201d she says with slow determination. \u201cAnd we\u2019re going to go on a date.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFine.

Some silence!</p><p>I\u2019m in the middle of typing a confirmation email to Jean about Flash when the phone rings. I pick it up absently and cradle the receiver under my chin. \u201cHello, Lara speaking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi there.\u201d An awkward-sounding male voice comes over the phone. \u201cThis is Ed Harrison.\u201d</p><p>I freeze. Ed Harrison?</p> <p>\u201cUm... hi!\u201d I look wildly around the office for Sadie, but she\u2019s nowhere.</p><p>\u201cSo... I guess we\u2019re going on a date,\u201d says Ed stiffly.</p><p>\u201cI... guess we are.\u201d</p><p>We sound like a pair of people who\u2019ve won an outing in a raffle and don\u2019t know how to get out of it.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a bar in St. Christopher\u2019s Place,\u201d he says. \u201cThe Crowe Bar. You want to have a drink there?\u201d</p> <p>I can read his mind instantly. He\u2019s suggesting a drink because that\u2019s about the quickest date you can have. He really doesn\u2019t want to do this. So why did he call? Is he so old-fashioned and polite that he felt he couldn\u2019t blow me off, even though for all he knows I could be a serial killer?</p><p>\u201cGood idea,\u201d I say brightly.</p><p>\u201cSaturday night, seven-thirty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee you there.\u201d</p><p>As I put the phone down, I feel surreal. I\u2019m actually going on a date with Mr. American Frown. And Sadie has no idea.</p><p>\u201cSadie.\u201d I look around. \u201cSa-die! Can you hear me? You won\u2019t believe it! He called!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know,\u201d comes Sadie\u2019s voice from behind me, and I swivel around to see her sitting on the windowsill, looking totally unruffled.</p><p>\u201cYou missed it!\u201d I say in excitement. \u201cYour guy called! We\u2019re going on a-\u201d I break off as it hits me. \u201cOh my God. You did this, didn\u2019t you? You went and shouted at him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I did!\u201d she says proudly. \u201cIt was simply too dreary waiting for him to call, so I decided to give him a little nudge.\u201d Her eyebrows lower disapprovingly. \u201cYou were right, by the way. He had thrown the card away. It was in his bin, all crumpled up. He wasn\u2019t planning to call you at all!\u201d</p><p>She looks so outraged, I have to bite back a laugh.</p><p>\u201cWelcome to twenty-first-century dating. So how did you change his mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was terribly hard work!\u201d Sadie looks affronted. \u201cFirst I just told him to call you, but he absolutely ignored me. He kept turning away from me and typing more quickly. Then I got really close and told him if he didn\u2019t call you and fix a date at once, he\u2019d be cursed with illness by the god Ahab.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s the god Ahab?\u201d I ask incredulously.</p><p>\u201cHe was in a penny novelette I once read.\u201d Sadie looks pleased with herself. \u201cI said he\u2019d lose the use of his limbs and be covered with grotesque warts. I could see him waver, but he was still trying to ignore me. So then I looked at his typewriter-\u201d</p> <p>\u201cComputer?\u201d I interject.</p><p>\u201cWhatever it is,\u201d she says impatiently. \u201cI told him it would break down and he would lose his job unless he called you.\u201d Her mouth curves into a reminiscent smile. \u201cHe moved quite quickly after that. Although, you know, even when he was picking up the card he kept clutching his head and saying to himself, \u2018Why am I calling this girl? Why am I doing this?\u2019 So I yelled in his ear, \u2018You want to call her! She\u2019s very pretty!\u2019\u201d Sadie tosses her hair back triumphantly. \u201cAnd so he telephoned you. Aren\u2019t you impressed?\u201d</p><p>I gaze back at her, speechless. She\u2019s blackmailed this guy into going on a date with me. She\u2019s messed with his mind. She\u2019s forced him into a romance that he had no intention of pursuing.</p><p>She is the only woman I\u2019ve ever known who could make a man call. Ever .</p><p>OK, it took supernatural powers, but she did it.</p><p>\u201cGreat-Aunt Sadie,\u201d I say slowly, \u201cyou\u2019re brilliant.\u201d</p><p>NINE</p><p>Sometimes, when I can\u2019t get to sleep, I imagine all the rules I\u2019d invent if I ever got to be in charge of the world. There are quite a few which involve ex-boyfriends, as it happens, and now I\u2019ve got a new one:</p><p>Ex-boyfriends shall not be allowed to take another girl back to the special restaurant they used to go to with their previous girlfriend .</p><p>I still can\u2019t believe Josh is taking this girl to Bistro Martin. How can he? It\u2019s our place. We had our first date there, for God\u2019s sake. He\u2019s totally betraying all our memories. It\u2019s as if our whole relationship is an Etch A Sketch and he\u2019s deliberately shaking it clean and drawing a new picture, and forgetting all about the old, much better, and more interesting picture which used to be there. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Besides which, we\u2019ve only just broken up. How can he be dating another girl after only six weeks? Doesn\u2019t he know anything? Rushing blindly into a new relationship is never the answer; in fact, it\u2019ll probably make him really unhappy. I could have told him that, if he\u2019d asked me.</p><p>It\u2019s twelve-thirty on Saturday and I\u2019ve been sitting here for twenty minutes. I know the restaurant so well, I\u2019ve been able to plan things perfectly. I\u2019m in the corner, tucked out of sight, wearing a baseball cap just to be on the safe side. The restaurant\u2019s one of those bustling brasseries with lots of tables and plants and hooks for coats, so I\u2019m easily able to blend away in the background.</p><p>Josh is booked at one of the big wooden tables in the window-I peeked at the reservations list. I have a good view of it from my corner seat, so I\u2019ll be able to study this so-called Marie pretty carefully and watch their body language. Even better, I\u2019ll be able to listen to their conversation, because I\u2019ve bugged the table.</p><p>This isn\u2019t a joke-I\u2019ve genuinely bugged it. Three days ago I went online and bought a tiny remote microphone in a pack called My First Spy Kit. When it arrived, I realized it was designed for ten-year-old boys rather than adult ex-girlfriends, as it also came with a plastic Spy\u2019s Log Book and Cool Code Cracker.</p> <p>But so what? I\u2019ve tested it out and it works! It only has a range of twenty feet, but that\u2019s all I need. As soon as my waiter had taken my drink order, I made a pretext of needing the ladies\u2019 room. Casually, I sauntered past, pretended to drop something, and slapped the tiny sticky pad of the microphone on the underside of the table. The earpiece is hidden under my baseball cap. I just have to switch it on when I\u2019m ready.</p><p>And, OK, I know you shouldn\u2019t spy on people. I know I\u2019m doing a morally wrong thing. In fact, I had a big argument with Sadie about it. First she said I shouldn\u2019t come here at all. Then, when it was obvious she was going to lose that one, she said if I was that desperate to know what Josh was going to talk about, I should just sit near the table and eavesdrop. But what\u2019s the difference? If you\u2019re listening in, you\u2019re listening in, whether you\u2019re two feet or ten feet away.</p><p>The point is, when it comes to love there\u2019s a different set of morals. All\u2019s fair in love or war. It\u2019s for the greater good. Like those people at Bletchley, cracking German codes. That was an invasion of privacy, too, if you think about it. But they didn\u2019t care, did they?</p><p>I have an image of myself, happily married to Josh, sitting around at Sunday lunch and saying to my children, \u201cYou know, I very nearly didn\u2019t bug Daddy\u2019s table. And then none of you would be here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think he\u2019s coming now!\u201d Sadie suddenly says beside me. I finally talked her into being my assistant, although all she\u2019s done so far is wander about the restaurant saying disparaging things about people\u2019s outfits.</p> <p>I risk a tiny glance toward the door and feel a roller-coaster lurch. Oh God, oh God. Sadie\u2019s right-it\u2019s him. And her. They\u2019re together. Why are they together?</p><p>OK, don\u2019t freak out. Don\u2019t imagine them waking up in bed, all sleepy and sex-satisfied. There could be lots of other perfectly reasonable explanations. Maybe they met at the tube or something. I take a deep gulp of wine, then raise my eyes again. I don\u2019t know who to study first, Josh or her.</p><p>Her.</p><p>She\u2019s blond. Quite skinny, in orange pedal pushers and one of those crisp white sleeveless tops that women wear in ads for low-fat yogurt or toothpaste. The kind of top you can only wear if you\u2019re good at ironing, which just shows how tedious she must be. Her arms are tanned and there are streaks in her hair, as though she\u2019s been on holiday.</p><p>As I shift my gaze to Josh, I feel my stomach go all slithery. He\u2019s just... Josh. Same fair floppy hair, same goofy lopsided grin as he greets the ma\u00eetre-d\u2019, same faded jeans, same canvas sneakers (some cool Japanese label I\u2019ve never quite got the hang of pronouncing), same shirt-</p><p>Hang on. I stare at him in disbelieving shock. That\u2019s the shirt I gave him for his birthday.</p> <p>How can he be doing this? Does he have no heart? He\u2019s wearing my shirt in our place. And he\u2019s smiling at this girl as though no one exists but her. Now he\u2019s taking her arm and making some joke which I can\u2019t hear but makes her throw back her head and laugh with her toothpaste-ad white teeth.</p><p>\u201cThey look very well suited,\u201d says Sadie brightly in my ear.</p><p>\u201cNo, they don\u2019t,\u201d I mutter. \u201cBe quiet.\u201d</p><p>The ma\u00eetre-d\u2019 is showing them to the window table. Keeping my head down, I reach into my pocket and switch on the remote control for the microphone. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The sound is faint and buzzy, but I can just about hear his voice.</p><p>\u201c... totally wasn\u2019t paying attention. \u2019Course, it turns out the bloody GPS has sent me to completely the wrong Notre Dame.\u201d He gives her a charming grin and she giggles.</p><p>I almost want to leap up from my table, I\u2019m so livid. That\u2019s our anecdote! That happened to us! We ended up at the wrong Notre Dame in Paris and we never saw the real one. Has he forgotten he was with me? Is he just editing me out of his life?</p><p>\u201cHe looks very happy, don\u2019t you think?\u201d observes Sadie.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s not happy!\u201d I give her a venomous glare. \u201cHe\u2019s in total denial.\u201d</p><p>They\u2019re ordering a bottle of wine. Great. Now I have to watch them get all merry. I take a few olives and munch disconsolately. Sadie has slid into the seat opposite and is watching me with a trace of pity.</p><p>\u201cI warned you, never be a trailer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not being a trailer! I\u2019m... trying to understand him.\u201d I swirl my wine around a few times. \u201cWe ended so suddenly. He just cut me off. I wanted to work at our relationship, you know? I wanted to talk things through. Like, was it the commitment thing? Or was there something else? But he wouldn\u2019t. He didn\u2019t give me a chance.\u201d</p><p>I glance over at Josh, who is smiling at Marie while the waiter uncorks a bottle. I could be watching our own first date. It was just the same, all smiles and amusing little stories and wine. Where did it go wrong? How did I end up sitting in a corner bugging him?</p> <p>And then the solution hits me, with total clarity. I lean over toward Sadie with urgency.</p><p>\u201cGo and ask him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk him what?\u201d She makes a face.</p><p>\u201cWhere it went wrong! Ask Josh what was wrong with me! Get him to speak out loud, the way you did with Ed Harrison. Then I\u2019ll know!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do that!\u201d she objects at once.</p><p>\u201cYes, you can! Get inside his head! Make him talk! This is the only way I can get to him-\u201d I break off as a waitress approaches the table, her notepad out. \u201cOh, hi. I\u2019d love some... um... soup. Thanks.\u201d</p> <p>As the waitress moves off, I gaze entreatingly at Sadie. \u201cPlease. I\u2019ve come all this way. I\u2019ve made all this effort.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a moment\u2019s silence-then Sadie rolls her eyes. \u201cVery well.\u201d</p><p>She disappears, then a moment later reappears right by Josh\u2019s table. I watch, my heart galloping. I push my earpiece more firmly into my ear, ignoring the buzz, and listen to Marie\u2019s rippling laugh as she tells some story about horse riding. She\u2019s got a faint Irish brogue, which I didn\u2019t notice before. As I glance over, I see Josh topping up her glass of wine.</p><p>\u201cYour childhood sounds amazing,\u201d he\u2019s saying. \u201cYou have to tell me more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want to know?\u201d She breaks off a piece of bread. But doesn\u2019t put it in her mouth, I notice.</p><p>\u201cEverything.\u201d He smiles.</p><p>\u201cCould take a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in no hurry.\u201d Josh\u2019s voice has deepened a smidgen. I\u2019m watching in horror. They\u2019ve got that whole eyes-meeting frissony thing going on. Any minute he\u2019ll take her hand, or even worse. What\u2019s Sadie waiting for?</p> <p>\u201cWell, I was born in Dublin.\u201d She smiles. \u201cThird of three.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you break up with Lara?\u201d Sadie\u2019s voice is so piercing through my earpiece, I nearly jump out of my chair.</p><p>Josh has heard her, I can tell. His hand has stopped halfway through pouring out fizzy water.</p><p>\u201cMy two brothers tormented me, all through my childhood.\u201d Marie is still speaking, obviously unaware of anything. \u201cThey were so evil...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you break up with Lara? What went wrong? Talk to Marie about it! Talk, Josh!\u201d</p><p>\u201c... found frogs in my bed, in my satchel... once even in my cereal bowl!\u201d Marie looks up at Josh, clearly expecting him to respond. But he\u2019s frozen like a statue, as Sadie yells in his ear, \u201cSay it, say it, say it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJosh?\u201d Marie waves her hand in front of his face. \u201cDid you hear a word I said?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry!\u201d He rubs his face. \u201cI don\u2019t know what happened there. What were you saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh... nothing.\u201d She shrugs. \u201cJust telling you about my brothers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour brothers! Right!\u201d With an obvious effort, he refocuses on her and smiles charmingly. \u201cSo, are they very protective of their little sister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better watch out!\u201d She smiles back and takes a sip of wine. \u201cHow about you, any siblings?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSay why you split up with Lara!

It\u2019s weird. I was just thinking about my ex, Lara.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh.\u201d Marie keeps smiling, exactly the same amount of smile, but I can see the muscles tense up a little in her jaw. \u201cWhat about her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Josh screws up his face, looking perplexed. \u201cI was just thinking what it was about her and me that went wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelationships end.\u201d Marie sips her water. \u201cWho knows why? These things happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Josh still has a faraway look in his eyes, which isn\u2019t surprising, as Sadie is yelling like a siren in his ear. \u201cSay why it went wrong! Say it out loud!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo.\u201d Marie changes the subject. \u201cHow was your week? I\u2019ve had a hellish time with that client. Remember the one I was telling you about-\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI suppose she was a bit intense,\u201d Josh blurts out.</p><p>\u201cWho was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, really?\u201d I can see Marie trying to feign interest.</p><p>\u201cShe used to read me out \u2018relationship issues\u2019 from some bullshit magazine and want to talk about how similar we were to some other random couple. For hours. That annoyed me. Why did she have to analyze everything? Why did she have to unpick every single row and conversation?\u201d</p><p>He gulps at his wine and I stare at him across the restaurant, stricken. I never knew he felt that way.</p> <p>\u201cThat does sound annoying.\u201d Marie nods sympathetically. \u201cAnyway, how did that big meeting go? You said your boss had some announcement to make?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else?\u201d Sadie is shrieking at Josh, drowning out Marie. \u201cWhat else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe used to litter the bathroom with her creams and crap.\u201d Josh frowns distantly at the memory. \u201cEvery time I tried to shave I had to fight through this thicket of pots. It drove me mad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a pain!\u201d says Marie, overbrightly. \u201cAnyway-\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was the little things. Like the way she used to sing in the shower. I mean, I don\u2019t mind singing, but the same song every bloody day? And she didn\u2019t want to open her mind. She\u2019s not interested in traveling, not interested in the same things as me... Like, I once bought her this book of William Eggleston photography; I thought we could talk about it or whatever. But she just flipped through with zero interest-\u201d Josh suddenly notices Marie, whose face has almost seized up with the effort of listening politely. \u201cShit. Marie. I\u2019m sorry!\u201d He rubs his face with both hands. \u201cI don\u2019t know why Lara keeps popping into my head. Let\u2019s talk about something else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, let\u2019s do that.\u201d Marie smiles stiffly. \u201cI was going to tell you about my client, the really demanding one from Seattle? You remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I remember!\u201d He reaches for his wine-then seems to change his mind and picks up his glass of fizzy water instead.</p><p>\u201cSoup? Excuse me, miss, didn\u2019t you order the soup? Excuse me?\u201d</p> <p>Suddenly I realize a waiter is standing by my table with a tray of soup and bread. I have no idea how long he\u2019s been trying to get my attention.</p><p>\u201cOh, right,\u201d I say, quickly turning to him. \u201cYes, thanks.\u201d</p><p>The waiter deposits my food and I pick up a spoon, but I can\u2019t eat. I\u2019m too flabbergasted by everything Josh just said. How could he have felt all this and never mentioned it? If he was annoyed by my singing, then why didn\u2019t he say? And as for the photography book, I thought he\u2019d bought it for himself! Not for me! How was I supposed to know it meant so much to him?</p><p>\u201cWell!\u201d Sadie bounces up to me and slides into the seat opposite. \u201cThat was interesting. Now you know where it all went wrong. I agree about the singing,\u201d she adds. \u201cYou are rather tuneless.\u201d</p><p>Doesn\u2019t she have an ounce of sympathy?</p><p>\u201cWell, thanks.\u201d I keep my voice low and gaze morosely into my soup. \u201cYou know the worst thing? He never said any of this stuff to my face. None of it! I could have fixed it! I would have fixed it.\u201d I start crumbling a piece of bread into pieces. \u201cIf he\u2019d just given me a chance-\u201d</p><p>\u201cShall we go now?\u201d She sounds bored.</p><p>\u201cNo! We haven\u2019t finished!\u201d I take a deep breath. \u201cGo and ask him what he liked about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat he liked about you?\u201d Sadie gives me a dubious look. \u201cAre you sure there was anything?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes!\u201d I hiss indignantly. \u201cOf course there was! Go on!\u201d</p><p>Sadie opens her mouth as though to speak-then shrugs and heads back across the restaurant. I push my earpiece in more firmly and dart a glance over at Josh. He\u2019s sipping his wine and skewering olives with a metal pick while Marie talks.</p><p>\u201c... three years is a long time.\u201d I hear her lilting voice over the buzz and crackle. \u201cAnd, yes, it was hard to finish, but he wasn\u2019t right, and I\u2019ve never regretted it or looked back. I guess what I\u2019m trying to say is... relationships end, but you have to move forward.\u201d She gulps her wine. \u201cYou know what I mean?\u201d</p><p>Josh is nodding automatically, but I can tell he isn\u2019t hearing a word. He has a bemused look on his face and keeps trying to edge his head away from Sadie, who\u2019s yelling, \u201cWhat did you love about Lara? Say it! Say it!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI loved the way she had so much energy,\u201d he says in a desperate rush. \u201cAnd she was quirky. She always had some cute necklace on, or a pencil stuffed into her hair or something... And she really appreciated stuff. You know, some girls, you do things for them and they just take it as their due, but she never did. She\u2019s really sweet. Refreshing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre we talking about your ex-girlfriend again, by any chance?\u201d There\u2019s a steely edge to Marie\u2019s voice, which makes even me wince. Josh seems to come to.</p><p>\u201cShit! Marie. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s got into me. I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m even thinking about her.\u201d He rubs his brow, looking so freaked out I almost feel sorry for him.</p><p>\u201cIf you ask me, you\u2019re still obsessed,\u201d Marie says tightly.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Josh gives a shocked burst of laughter. \u201cI\u2019m not obsessed! I\u2019m not even interested in her anymore!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo why are you telling me how great she was?\u201d I watch, agog, as Marie throws down her napkin, pushes back her chair, and stands up. \u201cCall me when you\u2019re over her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am over her!\u201d Josh exclaims angrily. \u201cJesus Christ! This is fucking ridiculous. I hadn\u2019t thought about her until today.\u201d He pushes back his chair, trying to get Marie\u2019s full attention. \u201cListen to me, Marie. Lara and I had a relationship. It was fine, but it wasn\u2019t great. And then it finished. End of.\u201d</p><p>Marie is shaking her head.</p><p>\u201cWhich is why you bring her up in conversation every five minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t ! \u201d Josh almost yells in frustration, and a few people at nearby tables look up. \u201cNot normally! I haven\u2019t talked about her or thought about her for weeks! I don\u2019t know what the fuck\u2019s wrong with me today!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to sort yourself out,\u201d Marie says, not unkindly. She picks up her bag. \u201cSee you, Josh.\u201d</p> <p>As she moves swiftly between the tables and out of the restaurant, Josh sinks back into his seat, looking shell-shocked. He looks even more gorgeous when he\u2019s hassled than when he\u2019s happy. Somehow I suppress an urge to run over and fling my arms around him and tell him he never wanted to be with such an uptight, toothpaste-ad girl, anyway.</p><p>\u201cAre you satisfied now?\u201d Sadie returns to my side. \u201cYou\u2019ve ruined the path of true love. I thought that was against your creed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t true love.\u201d I scowl at her.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I know. Shut up.\u201d</p><p>We both watch in silence as Josh pays his bill, reaches for his jacket, and gets up to leave. His jaw is tight and his easy saunter has gone, and I feel a flash of guilt. But I force myself to quell it. I know I\u2019m doing the right thing. Not just for me but for Josh. I can make it work between us, I know I can.</p><p>\u201cEat your lunch! Hurry up!\u201d Sadie interrupts my reverie. \u201cWe need to go home now. You need to start getting ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d I look at her, confused.</p> <p>\u201cFor our date!\u201d</p><p>Oh God. That.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nearly six hours away,\u201d I point out. \u201cAnd we\u2019re only going for a drink. There\u2019s no rush.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI used to take all day getting ready for parties.\u201d She shoots me an accusing look. \u201cThis is my date. You\u2019re representing me. You need to look divine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll look as divine as I can, OK?\u201d I take a spoonful of soup.</p><p>\u201cBut you haven\u2019t even chosen a frock!\u201d Sadie is hopping with impatience. \u201cIt\u2019s already two o\u2019clock! We need to go home now. Now!\u201d</p><p>For God\u2019s sake.</p><p>\u201cFine. Whatever.\u201d I push away my soup-it\u2019s gone cold, anyway. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>All the way home, I\u2019m deep in thought. Josh is vulnerable. He\u2019s confused. It\u2019s the perfect time for me to rekindle our love. But I have to use what I\u2019ve learned. I have to change myself.</p><p>I keep obsessively tracking back over everything he said, trying to remember every detail. And every time I reach one particular phrase, I squirm and wince. It was fine, but it wasn\u2019t great .</p><p>It\u2019s all blindingly clear now. Our relationship wasn\u2019t great because he wasn\u2019t honest with me. He didn\u2019t tell me any of his little niggles. And they all built up in his head and that\u2019s why he chucked me.</p><p>But it doesn\u2019t matter-because now I know what the problems are, I can solve them! All of them! I\u2019ve put together an action plan, and I\u2019m going to start by tidying up my bathroom. As soon as we get back to my flat, I stride in, full of optimism, to find Sadie heading me off.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you going to wear tonight?\u201d she demands. \u201cShow me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLater.\u201d I try to get past her.</p><p>\u201cNot later! Now! Now!\u201d</p><p>For God\u2019s sake.</p><p>\u201cAll right!\u201d I head into my bedroom and wrench open the little curtain that hides my wardrobe. \u201cWhat about... this.\u201d At random, I pull out a maxiskirt and my new limited-edition corset top from Topshop. \u201cAnd some wedge sandals, maybe.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cStays?\u201d Sadie looks as though I\u2019m brandishing a pig\u2019s corpse. \u201cAnd a long skirt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the maxi look, OK? It\u2019s really fashionable, actually. And these aren\u2019t stays, it\u2019s a corset top.\u201d</p><p>Sadie touches my corset top with a shudder. \u201cMy mother tried to make me wear stays to my aunt\u2019s wedding,\u201d she says. \u201cI threw them on the fire, so she shut me in my room and told the servants not to let me out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I feel a spark of interest in spite of myself. \u201cSo you missed the wedding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI climbed out the window, took the motor, drove to London, and had my hair shingled,\u201d she says proudly. \u201cWhen my mother saw it, she went to bed for two days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d I put the clothes down on the bed and look at Sadie properly. \u201cYou were a real rebel. Were you always doing things like that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI did rather torture my parents. But they were so stifling. So Victorian . The whole house was like a museum.\u201d She shudders. \u201cMy father disapproved of the phonograph, the Charleston, cocktails ... everything . He thought girls should spend their time arranging flowers and doing needlework. Like my sister, Virginia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean... Granny?\u201d Now I\u2019m fascinated to hear more. I only have hazy memories of Granny, as a gray-haired lady who liked gardening. I can\u2019t even imagine her as a girl. \u201cWhat was she like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHorribly virtuous.\u201d Sadie makes a face. \u201cShe wore stays. Even after the whole world had stopped wearing them, Virginia laced herself in and put her hair up and arranged the flowers in church every week. She was the dullest girl in Archbury. And then she married the dullest man in Archbury. My parents were overjoyed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s Archbury?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere we lived. A village in Hertfordshire.\u201d</p><p>This is ringing bells in my mind. Archbury . I know I\u2019ve heard it-</p><p>\u201cHang on!\u201d I say suddenly. \u201cArchbury House. The house that burned down in the 1960s. Was that your house?\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s all coming back to me now. Years ago Dad told me about the old family home, Archbury House, and even showed me a black-and-white photo dating from the 1800s. He said that he and Uncle Bill had spent summers there when they were little boys and then moved in when their grandparents died. It was a wonderful place, all old corridors and huge cellars and a great big grand staircase. But after the fire, the land was sold off and a development of new houses was built in its place.</p> <p>\u201cYes. Virginia was living there with her family by then. In fact, she caused the fire. She left a candle alight.\u201d There\u2019s a moment\u2019s silence before Sadie adds with an acidic edge, \u201cNot so perfect after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe drove through the village once,\u201d I volunteer. \u201cWe saw the new houses. They looked OK.\u201d</p><p>Sadie doesn\u2019t seem to hear me. \u201cI lost all my things,\u201d she says distantly. \u201cAll the things I was keeping there while I was abroad. All destroyed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s awful,\u201d I say, feeling inadequate.</p><p>\u201cWhat does it matter?\u201d She suddenly seems to come to and gives me a brittle smile. \u201cWho cares?\u201d She whirls away, toward the wardrobe, and points imperiously. \u201cGet out your clothes. I need to see them all.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d I grab an armful of hangers and dump them on the bed. \u201cSo, tell me about your husband. What was he like?\u201d</p><p>Sadie considers for a moment. \u201cHe wore a scarlet waistcoat at our wedding. Other than that, I remember very little about him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it? A waistcoat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he had a mustache,\u201d she adds.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t get you.\u201d I throw another armful of clothes onto the bed. \u201cHow could you marry someone you didn\u2019t love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it was my only way to escape,\u201d says Sadie, as though it\u2019s obvious. \u201cI\u2019d had the most terrible row with my parents. My father had stopped my allowance, the vicar called every second day, I was locked in my room every night-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat had you done?\u201d I say, avid with curiosity. \u201cHad you been arrested again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt... doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d says Sadie after a slight pause. She turns away from my gaze and stares out of the window. \u201cI had to leave. Marriage seemed as good a way as any. My parents had already found a suitable young man. And, believe me, they were hardly lining up in droves in those days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, well, I know about that,\u201d I say, rolling my eyes in sympathy. \u201cThere are no single men in London. None. It\u2019s a well-known fact.\u201d</p> <p>I look up to see Sadie gazing at me with a kind of blank incomprehension.</p><p>\u201cWe lost all ours in the war,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cOh. Of course.\u201d I swallow. \u201cThe war.\u201d</p><p>World War I. I hadn\u2019t quite put that together.</p><p>\u201cThe ones who survived weren\u2019t the same boys they\u2019d been. They were wounded. Broken to bits. Or full of guilt because they\u2019d survived...\u201d A shadow passes across her face. \u201cMy older brother was killed, you know. Edwin. He was nineteen. My parents never really got over it.\u201d</p><p>I stare at her, appalled. I had a great-uncle Edwin who was killed in World War I? Why don\u2019t I know this stuff?</p> <p>\u201cWhat was he like?\u201d I ask timidly. \u201cEdwin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was... funny.\u201d Her mouth twists as though she wants to smile but can\u2019t let herself. \u201cHe made me laugh. He made my parents more bearable. He made everything more bearable.\u201d</p><p>The room is quiet, save for the tinny sound of the TV upstairs. Sadie\u2019s face is immobile, transfixed with memories or thoughts. She almost seems in a trance.</p><p>\u201cBut even if there weren\u2019t many men around,\u201d I venture, \u201cdid you have to settle? Did you have to marry some random guy? What about waiting for the right guy? What about love?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018What about love!\u2019\u201d she mimics me mockingly, snapping out of her reverie. \u201c\u2018What about love!\u2019 Goodness, you play a monotonous tune.\u201d She surveys the mound of clothes on the bed. \u201cLay them out so I can see properly. I\u2019ll choose your dress for this evening. And it won\u2019t be a ghastly long skirt to the ground.\u201d</p><p>Obviously the reminiscing is over.</p><p>\u201cOK.\u201d I start spreading my clothes out on the bed. \u201cYou choose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m in charge of your hairstyle and makeup,\u201d Sadie adds firmly. \u201cI\u2019m in charge of everything.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFine,\u201d I say patiently.</p><p>As I head back to the bathroom, my head is full of Sadie\u2019s stories. I\u2019ve never been into family trees or history. But somehow this is all quite fascinating. Maybe I\u2019ll get Dad to dig out a few photos of the old family house. He\u2019ll love that.</p><p>I close the door and survey my pots of creams and cosmetics, all balanced on the counter around the basin. Hmm. Perhaps Josh had a point. Maybe I don\u2019t need apricot scrub and oatmeal scrub and sea salt scrub. I mean, how scrubbed should skin be, anyway?</p><p>Half an hour later I\u2019ve got everything organized into rows and have assembled a whole carrier bag of ancient, half-empty pots to chuck out. Already my action plan is under way! If Josh saw this bathroom, he\u2019d be so impressed! I almost feel like taking a picture of it and sending him a text. Feeling delighted with myself, I duck my head back into my bedroom, but Sadie\u2019s not there.</p><p>\u201cSadie?\u201d I call, but there\u2019s no reply. I hope she\u2019s OK. It was obviously hard for her, remembering her brother. Maybe she needed a quiet moment alone.</p><p>I put the bag of pots next to the back door to deal with later and make myself a cup of tea. Next on my list is to find that photography book he was talking about. It must still be around here somewhere. Maybe under the sofa...</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve found it!\u201d Sadie\u2019s excited voice springing out of nowhere nearly makes me knock my head on the coffee table.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do that!\u201d I sit up and reach for my cup of tea. \u201cListen, Sadie, I just want to say... are you OK? Do you want to talk?

I meant feelings.\u201d I give her an understanding look. \u201cYou\u2019ve been through a lot, it must have affected you...\u201d</p><p>Sadie doesn\u2019t even hear me. Or, if she does, she pretends not to. \u201cI\u2019ve found you a frock,\u201d she announces. \u201cCome and see!

So what did you choose?\u201d I get up and start heading toward my bedroom.</p><p>\u201cNot there.\u201d Sadie darts in front of me. \u201cWe have to go out! It\u2019s in a shop!\u201d</p><p>\u201cA shop?\u201d I stop and stare at her. \u201cWhat do you mean, in a shop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was forced to go out.\u201d She lifts her chin defiantly. \u201cThere was nothing in your wardrobe. I\u2019ve never seen such bedraggled clothes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not bedraggled!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo I went out, and I found an angel of a dress! You simply have to buy it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d I\u2019m trying to think where she could have gone. \u201cWhich shop? Did you go into central London?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll show you! Come on! Get your purse!\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help feeling touched at the thought of Sadie wafting around H &amp;M or wherever, trying to find an outfit for me.</p><p>\u201cWell, OK,\u201d I say at last. \u201cAs long as it doesn\u2019t cost a zillion pounds.\u201d I reach for my bag and check I\u2019ve got my keys. \u201cCome on, then. Show me.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m expecting Sadie to lead me to the tube station and drag me to Oxford Circus or somewhere. But instead she veers around the corner and into a grid of backstreets I\u2019ve never explored.</p> <p>\u201cAre you sure it\u2019s this way?\u201d I hesitate, puzzled.</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d She tries to drag me forward. \u201cCome on!\u201d</p><p>We pass rows of houses and a little park and a college. There\u2019s nothing here that looks like a shop. I\u2019m about to tell Sadie that she must have got her bearings wrong, when she turns a corner and makes a triumphant flourish.</p><p>\u201cThere!\u201d</p><p>We\u2019re in front of a tiny parade of shops. There\u2019s a newsagent and a dry cleaner and, right at the end, a tiny shop with a wood-painted sign reading Vintage Fashion Emporium . There\u2019s a mannequin in the window wearing a long satin dress, gloves up to the elbow, a hat with a veil, and lots of brooches everywhere. Next to her is a pile of old hatboxes and a dressing table holding a large selection of enamel hairbrushes.</p><p>\u201cThis is by far the best shop you have in your area,\u201d says Sadie emphatically. \u201cI\u2019ve found everything we need. Come on!\u201d</p><p>Before I can say anything, she\u2019s disappeared into the shop. I have no choice but to follow her. The door gives a little ting as I enter, and a middle-aged woman smiles at me from behind a tiny counter. She has straggly dyed hair in a vivid shade of yellow and is wearing what looks like an original seventies caftan in a wild green circular print, together with several amber necklaces strung around her neck.</p><p>\u201cHello!\u201d She smiles pleasantly. \u201cWelcome to the shop. I\u2019m Norah. Have you shopped here before?\u201d \u201cHi.\u201d I nod back. \u201cThis is my first time.\u201d \u201cWere you interested in a particular garment or era?\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll... just have a browse.\u201d I smile at her. \u201cThanks.\u201d I can\u2019t see Sadie, so I start wandering around. I\u2019ve never been into vintage clothes, but even I can tell there\u2019s some pretty amazing stuff here. A pink psychedelic sixties dress is displayed next to a beehive wig. There\u2019s a whole rack of original-looking boned corsets and petticoats. On a dressmaker\u2019s mannequin is a cream lace wedding dress with a veil and a tiny dried-flower bouquet. A glass case holds some white leather skating boots, all creased and weathered with use. There are collections of fans, handbags, old lipstick cases-</p> <p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d Sadie\u2019s impatient voice pierces my eardrum. \u201cCome here!\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s beckoning from a rack toward the back. Feeling sudden misgivings, I head toward her.</p><p>\u201cSadie,\u201d I say in a low voice. \u201cI agree this stuff is cool and everything. But I\u2019m only going for a casual drink. You can\u2019t possibly think-\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook!\u201d She gestures in triumph. \u201cPerfect.\u201d I\u2019m never letting a ghost give me fashion advice again. Sadie is pointing at a 1920s flapper\u2019s dress. A bronze silk flapper dress with a dropped waist, little beaded capped sleeves, and a matching cape. The store tag reads: Original 1920s dress, made in Paris . </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it darling?\u201d She clasps her hands and whirls around, her eyes bright with enthusiasm. \u201cMy friend Bunty had one very similar, you know, only in silver.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSadie!\u201d I find my voice. \u201cI can\u2019t wear that on a date!

Very rare .</p><p>\u201cI had a set just like this.\u201d She\u2019s gazing at it fondly. \u201cThis is the best lipstick that was ever made. I\u2019ll teach you how to do yours properly.\u201d</p><p>For God\u2019s sake.</p><p>\u201cI know how to do my lipstick properly, thanks-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea,\u201d she cuts me off crisply. \u201cBut I\u2019ll teach you. And we\u2019ll marcel your hair. There are some irons for sale.\u201d She points at an old cardboard box inside which I can see some weird-looking ancient metal contraption. \u201cYou\u2019ll look so much better if you make an effort.\u201d Her head swivels around again. \u201cIf we could just find you some decent stockings-\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSadie, stop it!\u201d I hiss. \u201cYou must be crazy! I\u2019m not getting any of this stuff-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still remember that delicious smell of getting ready for parties.\u201d She closes her eyes briefly as though transfixed. \u201cLipstick and singed hair-\u201d</p><p>\u201cSinged hair?\u201d I squeak in horror. \u201cYou\u2019re not singeing my hair!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t fuss!\u201d she says impatiently. \u201cWe only singed it sometimes .\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you getting on all right?\u201d Norah appears, jangling amber, and I jump in surprise.</p><p>\u201cOh. Yes, thanks.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you particularly interested in the 1920s?\u201d She heads over to the glass case. \u201cWe\u2019ve some marvelous original items here. All fresh in from a recent auction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I nod politely. \u201cI was just looking at them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure what this was for...\u201d She picks out a little jeweled pot mounted on a circular ring. \u201cStrange little thing, isn\u2019t it? A locket, maybe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA rouge ring,\u201d says Sadie, rolling her eyes. \u201cDoes no one have any idea about anything anymore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s a rouge ring,\u201d I can\u2019t help saying casually.</p><p>\u201cAh!\u201d Norah looks impressed. \u201cYou\u2019re an expert! Maybe you know how to use these old marcel irons.\u201d She takes out the metal contraption and hefts it cautiously in her hand. \u201cI believe there was quite a knack to it. Before my time, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s easy,\u201d says Sadie scornfully into my ear. \u201cI\u2019ll show you.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a ting from the door and two girls come in, oohing and aahing as they look around. \u201cThis place is wicked,\u201d I hear one of them saying.</p> <p>\u201cExcuse me.\u201d Norah smiles. \u201cI\u2019ll let you keep browsing. If you\u2019d like to try anything on, let me know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d I smile back at her. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell her you want to try the bronze dress on!\u201d Sadie shoos me forward. \u201cGo on!\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it!\u201d I hiss as the woman disappears. \u201cI don\u2019t want to try it on!\u201d</p><p>Sadie looks bemused. \u201cBut you have to try it. What if it doesn\u2019t fit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have to, because I\u2019m not wearing it!\u201d My frustration bubbles over. \u201cGet real! This is the twenty-first century! I\u2019m not using some ancient old lipstick and curling irons! I\u2019m not wearing a flapper\u2019s dress on a date! It\u2019s just not happening!\u201d</p><p>For a few moments Sadie seems too taken aback to reply.</p><p>\u201cBut... you promised.\u201d She fixes me with huge, wounded eyes. \u201cYou promised I could choose your dress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you meant normal clothes!\u201d I say in exasperation. \u201cTwenty-first-century clothes! Not this.\u201d I pick up the dress and brandish it at her. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous! It\u2019s a costume!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if you don\u2019t wear the dress I choose, then it might as well not be my date at all. It might as well be your date!\u201d Sadie\u2019s voice starts rising; I can tell she\u2019s cranking up into a scream. \u201cI might as well stay at home! Go out with him on your own!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I sigh. \u201cLook, Sadie-\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s my man!

She nods toward the bronze silk flapper dress, still in my arms. \u201cYou want to try that on? Wonderful piece. Made in Paris. Have you seen the mother-of-pearl buttons? They\u2019re exquisite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI... um...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou promised!\u201d Sadie\u2019s about three inches from me, her chin set, her eyes fiery. \u201cYou promised! It\u2019s my date! Mine! Mine!\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s like a relentless fire-engine siren. I jerk my head away, trying to think straight as best I can. There\u2019s no way I can cope with a whole evening of Sadie yelling at me. My head will explode.</p><p>And let\u2019s face it. Ed Harrison thinks I\u2019m a nutter anyway. What difference does it make if I turn up in a flapper dress?</p><p>Sadie\u2019s right. It\u2019s her evening. I might as well do it her way.</p><p>\u201cAll right!\u201d I say at last, cutting across Sadie\u2019s insistent voice. \u201cYou\u2019ve talked me around. I\u2019ll try on the dress.\u201d</p><p>TEN</p> <p>If anyone I know sees me, I will die. I will die .</p><p>As I get out of the taxi, I look quickly up and down the street. No one in sight, thank God. I have never looked so ludicrous in my life. This is what happens when you let a dead great-aunt take control of your looks.</p><p>I\u2019m wearing the flapper dress from the shop, which I only just managed to zip up. Clearly they didn\u2019t go in for boobs in the twenties. My feet are squished into the dancing slippers. Six long bead necklaces are jangling around my neck. Circling my head is a black headband, beaded with jet, and sticking out of that is a feather.</p><p>A feather .</p><p>My hair has been tortured into a series of old-fashioned-looking waves and curls, which took about two hours to do with the marcel irons. When it was done, Sadie insisted I smother it in some weird pomade stuff that she also found in the vintage shop, and now it feels rock solid to the touch.</p><p>And as for my makeup: Did they honestly think this was a good look in the 1920s? My face is covered in pale powder, with a spot of rouge on each cheek. My eyes are heavily outlined in black kohl. My lids are smeared with a lurid green paste, which came out of the old Bakelite case. I still don\u2019t know exactly what\u2019s on my eyelashes: some weird lump of black goo which Sadie called \u201cCosmetique.\u201d She made me boil it up in a frying pan and then smear it all over my lashes.</p><p>I mean, hello, I have a new Lanc\u00f4me mascara. It\u2019s waterproof, with flexible fibers and everything. But Sadie wasn\u2019t interested. She was too overexcited by all this stupid ancient makeup and telling me how she and Bunty used to get ready for parties together and pluck each other\u2019s eyebrows and take little swigs from their hip flasks.</p><p>\u201cLet me see.\u201d Sadie appears beside me on the pavement and scans me. She\u2019s in a gold dress, with gloves up to her elbows. \u201cYou need to touch up your lipstick.\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s no point suggesting a nice subtle MAC lip gloss instead. With a sigh, I reach in my bag for the pot of red gunk and pat yet more color onto my exaggerated Cupid\u2019s bow.</p><p>Two girls pass by, nudging each other and giving me curious smiles. They obviously think I\u2019m off to a costume party and am going for Most Over the Top outfit.</p><p>\u201cYou look divine!\u201d Sadie hugs herself with excitement. \u201cYou just need a gasper.\u201d She starts looking up and down the street. \u201cWhere\u2019s a tobacconist? Oh, we should have bought you a darling little cigarette holder-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t smoke,\u201d I cut her off. \u201cAnd you can\u2019t smoke in public places, anyway. It\u2019s the law.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a ridiculous law.\u201d She looks aggrieved. \u201cHow does one hold a cigarette party?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t hold cigarette parties! Smoking gives you cancer! It\u2019s dangerous!\u201d</p><p>Sadie makes an impatient tchuh noise. \u201cCome on, then!\u201d</p><p>I begin to follow her up the street toward the Crowe Bar sign, barely able to walk in my vintage shoes. As I reach the door, I realize she\u2019s disappeared. Where\u2019s she gone?</p><p>\u201cSadie?\u201d I turn around and scan the street. If she\u2019s left me in the lurch I will absolutely murder her- </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s in there already!\u201d She suddenly appears, looking even more hyper than before. \u201cHe\u2019s absolutely swoonsome.\u201d</p><p>My heart sinks. I was hoping he might have stood me up.</p><p>\u201cHow do I look?\u201d Sadie\u2019s smoothing her hair down, and I feel a sudden pang of compassion for her. It can\u2019t be much fun, going on a date and being invisible.</p><p>\u201cYou look great,\u201d I say reassuringly. \u201cIf he could see you, he\u2019d think you were really hot.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHot?\u201d She looks confused.</p><p>\u201cSexy. Pretty. You\u2019re a hottie. It\u2019s what we say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, good!\u201d Her eyes travel nervously to the door and back. \u201cNow, before we go in, remember this is my date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s your date,\u201d I say patiently. \u201cYou\u2019ve drummed it into me enough times-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I mean is-be me.\u201d She fixes me with an urgent look. \u201cSay whatever I tell you to say. Do whatever I tell you to do. Then I\u2019ll feel as though it\u2019s really me talking to him. Do you understand?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry! I get it. You feed me the lines and I\u2019ll say them. I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo on, then!\u201d She gestures at the entrance.</p><p>I push through the heavy frosted glass doors and find myself in a chic lobby with suede-paneled walls and low-level lighting. There\u2019s another set of double doors ahead, beyond which I can see the bar. As I pass through, I catch a glimpse of myself in a tinted mirror and feel a clench of dismay.</p><p>Somehow I feel a million times more ludicrous here than I did in my flat. My necklaces are jangling with every step. My feather is bobbing around in my headdress. I look like a twenties-o-gram. And I\u2019m standing in a minimalist bar full of cool people in understated Helmut Lang.</p><p>As I\u2019m edging forward, all prickly with self-consciousness, I suddenly spot Ed. He\u2019s sitting about ten yards away, in a conventional trousers-and-jacket combo, drinking what looks like a conventional gin and tonic. He looks up, glances my way, then does a double take.</p><p>\u201cYou see?\u201d says Sadie triumphantly. \u201cHe\u2019s transfixed by the sight of you!\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019s transfixed, all right. His jaw has fallen and his face has turned a pale green color.</p><p>Very slowly, as though forcing himself through noxious mud, he gets to his feet and approaches me. I can see the bar staff nudging one another as I walk through the bar, and from a nearby table comes a sudden gasp of hilarity.</p><p>\u201cSmile at him!\u201d Sadie is insisting loudly in my ear. \u201cWalk toward him with a shimmy and say, \u2018Hello, Daddy-O!\u2019\u201d</p><p>Daddy-O?</p><p>It\u2019s not my date, I remind myself feverishly. It\u2019s Sadie\u2019s. I\u2019m only acting a part.</p><p>\u201cHello, Daddy-O!\u201d I say brightly as he draws near.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d he says faintly. \u201cYou look...\u201d He moves his hands helplessly.</p><p>All around, the buzz of conversation has died to a halt. The whole bar is watching us. Great.</p> <p>\u201cSay some more!\u201d Sadie is hopping around in excitement, clearly oblivious to the awkwardness. \u201cSay, \u2018You look pretty dapper yourself, you old thing.\u2019 And twirl your necklace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look pretty dapper yourself, you old thing!\u201d I fix him with a rictus smile, swinging my beads around so hard that one of the necklaces catches me in the eye.</p><p>Ow. That hurt.</p><p>\u201cOK.\u201d Ed seems barely able to talk for embarrassment. \u201cWell. Can I... get you a drink? A glass of champagne?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk for a swizzle stick!\u201d instructs Sadie. \u201cAnd smile! You haven\u2019t laughed once!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould I have a swizzle stick?\u201d I give a high-pitched giggle. \u201cI simply adore swizzle sticks!\u201d</p><p>\u201cA swizzle stick?\u201d Ed frowns. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Fuck knows why. I dart a helpless look at Sadie.</p><p>\u201cSay, \u2018To stir the bubbles out, darling!\u2019\u201d she hisses.</p><p>\u201cTo stir the bubbles out, darling!\u201d I giggle brightly again, and twirl my necklaces for good measure.</p><p>Ed looks like he wants to sink into the floor. I don\u2019t blame him.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you take a seat?\u201d he says in a strained voice. \u201cI\u2019ll bring over the drinks.\u201d</p><p>I head over to the table where he was sitting and pull up a suede upholstered chair.</p><p>\u201cSit like this,\u201d commands Sadie, adopting an affected pose with her hands on her knee, and I copy as best I can. \u201cOpen your eyes wider!\u201d She looks restlessly around at all the clusters of people sitting in groups and standing at the bar. The hum of chatter has resumed, and there\u2019s a low throbbing of lounge-style music. \u201cWhen does the band arrive? When will the dancing start?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t any band,\u201d I mutter. \u201cThere isn\u2019t any dancing.

Don\u2019t they have anything with a bit of life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I say sarcastically. \u201cAsk him.\u201d I jerk my head toward the barman, just as Ed appears before me with a glass of champagne and what looks like another gin and tonic.

He sits down opposite, puts down the drinks, then lifts his glass.</p><p>\u201cCheers.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cChin chin!\u201d I say with a dazzling smile, give my champagne a brisk stir with a plastic swizzle stick, and take a glug. I look up for Sadie\u2019s approval-but she\u2019s disappeared. I surreptitiously look around and spot her behind the bar, yelling something in the barman\u2019s ear.</p><p>Oh God. What havoc is she causing now?</p><p>\u201cSo... did you have far to come?\u201d</p><p>My attention is wrenched away. Ed\u2019s talking to me. And there\u2019s no Sadie to feed me any lines. Great. I\u2019m actually going to have to make conversation.</p><p>\u201cEr... not too far. Kilburn.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAh. Kilburn.\u201d He nods as though I\u2019ve said something really profound.</p><p>While I\u2019m trying to think of something to say, I run my eyes over him. Nice charcoal jacket, I have to admit. He\u2019s taller than I remember, with a broader, firmer frame, in an expensive-looking shirt. A hint of five o\u2019clock shadow; the same V of frown lines that he had in the office. For God\u2019s sake. It\u2019s the weekend, he\u2019s on a date, yet he looks as if he\u2019s at some really serious board meeting where everyone\u2019s about to be fired and lose all their bonuses.</p><p>I feel a flash of irritation. He could at least try to look like he\u2019s having a good time.</p><p>\u201cSo! Ed.\u201d I make a heroic effort and smile at him. \u201cFrom your accent I\u2019m guessing you\u2019re American?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d He nods but doesn\u2019t volunteer any more.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you been over?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFive months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you like London?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t seen much of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you must!\u201d I can\u2019t help my natural enthusiasm pouring out. \u201cYou should go to the London Eye, and Covent Garden, and then you should take a boat to Greenwich...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d He gives me a tight smile and takes a slug of his drink. \u201cI\u2019m pretty busy at work.\u201d</p><p>That is the lamest thing I ever heard. How can you move to a city and not bother to get to know it? I knew I didn\u2019t like this guy. I glance up to see Sadie by my side, her arms folded sulkily.</p><p>\u201cThat barman is very stubborn,\u201d she says. \u201cGo and tell him to change the music.\u201d</p><p>Is she nuts? Shooting her a discreet glare, I turn back to Ed and smile politely.</p> <p>\u201cSo, Lara, what do you do?\u201d Clearly he feels he\u2019s got to join in this conversation too.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a headhunter.\u201d</p><p>Immediately, Ed looks wary. \u201cYou\u2019re not with Sturgis Curtis, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I have my own company, L &amp;N Executive Recruitment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I wouldn\u2019t have liked to offend you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with Sturgis Curtis?\u201d I can\u2019t resist asking.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re vultures from hell.\u201d He has such a look of horror on his face, I almost want to giggle. \u201cThey pester me every day. Do I want this job? Am I interested in that job? They use tricks to get past my secretary... I mean, they\u2019re good.\u201d He shudders. \u201cThey even asked me to sit at their table at the Business People dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, wow.\u201d I can\u2019t help sounding impressed. I\u2019ve never been to the Business People dinner, but I\u2019ve seen it written up in the magazine. It\u2019s always held at a big hotel in London, and it\u2019s pretty glam. \u201cSo... are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m speaking at it.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s speaking? Oh my God, he must be really important. I had no idea. I look up to raise an eyebrow at Sadie, but she\u2019s disappeared.</p><p>\u201cAre you going?\u201d he asks politely.</p><p>\u201cEr... not this year.\u201d I try to imply this is just a temporary blip. \u201cMy firm wasn\u2019t quite able to make up a table this year.\u201d</p><p>Bearing in mind tables hold twelve people and cost five thousand pounds. And L &amp;N Executive Recruitment has precisely two people and about minus five thousand pounds.</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d He inclines his head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be there next year, though,\u201d I say quickly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll probably make up two tables. You know, do it properly. We\u2019ll probably have expanded by then...\u201d I trail off. I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m making any effort to impress this guy. He clearly isn\u2019t interested in anything I say.</p><p>As I swizzle my drink again, I realize the music has stopped. I turn to look at the barman, and he\u2019s standing by the CD player behind the bar, obviously experiencing a momentous struggle between his own will and the sound of Sadie shrieking something in his ear. What is she up to?</p><p>At last, with a visible capitulation, the barman takes a CD from its box and slides it into the machine. The next minute, some scratchy, old-fashioned Cole Porter-type band music fills the air. Sadie sweeps up behind Ed\u2019s chair, a beam of satisfaction on her face.</p><p>\u201cAt last! I knew that man would have something suitable in his drawer. Now ask Lara to dance!\u201d she instructs Ed, and bends close to his ear. \u201cAsk her to dance!\u201d</p> <p>Oh God. No way.</p><p>Resist her , I silently message Ed. Don\u2019t listen. Be strong . I\u2019m sending him my strongest telepathic signals. But it\u2019s no good. As Sadie bellows in his ear, a pained, confused look is coming over Ed\u2019s face. He looks like someone who really, really doesn\u2019t want to vomit but is having no choice.</p><p>\u201cLara.\u201d He clears his throat and rubs his face. \u201cWould you like to... dance?\u201d</p><p>If I refuse him, Sadie will wreak her revenge on me, I know it. This is what she wanted; this is why we\u2019re all here. So she can dance with Ed.</p><p>\u201cOK.\u201d</p> <p>Hardly able to believe what I\u2019m doing, I put down my glass and stand up. I follow Ed to a tiny patch of spare floor next to the bar stools, and he turns to face me. For a moment we both just stare at each other, paralyzed by the enormity of the situation.</p><p>This is a one hundred percent nondancing scenario. We\u2019re not on a dance floor. This isn\u2019t a club, it\u2019s a bar. No one else is dancing. The jazz band is still playing its scratchy music through the speakers, and some bloke is singing about his fancy shoes. There\u2019s no beat, there\u2019s no nothing. There\u2019s no way we can dance.</p><p>\u201cDance!\u201d Sadie is flitting between us like quicksilver, a whirlwind of impatience. \u201cDance together! Dance!\u201d</p><p>With a look of desperation in his eyes, Ed starts moving awkwardly from side to side, trying as best he can to follow the music. He looks so miserable, I start copying him, just to make him feel better. I\u2019ve never seen less convincing dancing in my life.</p><p>Out of the corner of my eye I can see everyone turning to watch us. My dress is swishing backward and forward, and my necklaces are jangling. Ed\u2019s eyes are focused far ahead, as though he\u2019s having an out-of-body experience.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me.\u201d A member of the bar staff, carrying a plate of dim sum, ducks between us.</p> <p>Not only are we not on a dance floor, we\u2019re in the way of everyone. This is the most excruciating experience of my life.</p><p>\u201cDance properly!\u201d I turn my head to see Sadie regarding me in horror. \u201cThat\u2019s not dancing!\u201d</p><p>What does she expect us to do, the waltz?</p><p>\u201cYou look as though you\u2019re trudging through mud! This is how to dance.\u201d</p><p>She starts some twenties Charleston-type dance, all flying legs and elbows and knees. Her face is beatific, and I can hear her humming along to the music. At least someone\u2019s having fun.</p><p>As I watch, she shimmies right up to Ed and places a slender hand on each of his shoulders. Now she\u2019s running a hand adoringly down his cheek.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t he blissful?\u201d She runs both her hands down his chest, circling his waist and skimming down his back.</p><p>\u201cCan you feel him?\u201d I murmur incredulously, and Sadie flinches, as though I\u2019ve caught her out.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s... not the point,\u201d she says defensively. \u201cAnd it\u2019s none of your business.\u201d</p><p>OK, so she can\u2019t. Well, whatever rocks her boat, I suppose. But do I have to watch?</p><p>\u201cSadie!\u201d I hiss as her hands travel even further down his body. \u201cGet a room!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, what did you say?\u201d With an obvious effort, Ed focuses on me. He\u2019s still dancing from side to side, totally oblivious to the fact that he has a twenty-three-year-old flapper running her hands voraciously all over his body.</p><p>\u201cI said... let\u2019s stop.\u201d I avert my eyes from Sadie, who\u2019s trying to nibble his ear.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d protests Sadie furiously. \u201cMore!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat idea,\u201d says Ed at once, and starts back toward our chairs.</p><p>\u201cEd? Ed Harrison?\u201d A blond woman interrupts his path. She\u2019s wearing beige trousers and a white shirt and an expression of incredulous glee. At the table behind her, I can see several other well-groomed business types watching avidly. \u201cI thought that was you! Were you just... dancing?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As Ed surveys all the faces at the table, it\u2019s obvious his nightmare has just got about fifty times worse.

Genevieve, Lara. Hello, Bill, Mike, Sarah...\u201d He\u2019s nodding at all the people sitting round the table.</p><p>\u201cYour dress is adorable.\u201d Genevieve flicks a condescending glance over my outfit. \u201cGoing for the twenties look, obviously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s original.\u201d I nod.</p> <p>\u201cI have no doubt!\u201d</p><p>I smile as best I can, but she\u2019s touched a nerve. I don\u2019t want to be dressed up like something out of a Daily Mail vintage-dolls collection series. Especially not in front of what\u2019s clearly a collection of high-profile businesspeople.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just touch up my makeup.\u201d I force another smile. \u201cI\u2019ll be back in a minute.\u201d</p><p>In the ladies\u2019 room, I get out a tissue, wet it, and frantically scrub at my face. But nothing seems to be coming off.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Sadie appears behind me. \u201cYou\u2019ll ruin your face!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust trying to tone down the color,\u201d I say between jerky rubs.</p><p>\u201cOh, that rouge won\u2019t come off,\u201d says Sadie airily. \u201cIt\u2019s indelible. Lasts for days. The lipstick too.\u201d</p><p>Indelible?</p><p>\u201cWhere did you learn to dance?\u201d Sadie inserts herself between me and the mirror.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t. You don\u2019t learn to dance. You just pick it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it shows. You\u2019re terrible.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re totally over the top,\u201d I retort, stung. \u201cYou looked like you wanted to jump his bones right there!\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018Jump his bones.\u2019\u201d Sadie frowns. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means... You know.\u201d I stop awkwardly. I\u2019m not sure bone-jumping is something I want to be discussing with my great-aunt.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Sadie says impatiently. \u201cWhat does it mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do it with someone else.\u201d I choose my words carefully. \u201cIt\u2019s like a pajama party. Except you take off your pajamas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that.\u201d Her face clicks with recognition. \u201cYou call it \u2018jumping his bones\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes.\u201d I shrug.</p><p>\u201cWhat an odd phrase. We used to call it sex.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh,\u201d I say, discomfited. \u201cWell. We do too-\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr barney-mugging,\u201d she adds.</p><p>Barney-mugging? And she has the nerve to call jump his bones an odd phrase?</p><p>\u201cWell, whatever you call it.\u201d I take off one of my shoes and rub my sore toes. \u201cYou looked like you wanted to do it with him right there in the bar.\u201d</p><p>Sadie smirks and adjusts her headband, looking in the mirror. \u201cYou must admit he\u2019s handsome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the outside, maybe,\u201d I say grudgingly. \u201cBut he doesn\u2019t have any personality.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he does!\u201d says Sadie, looking offended.</p><p>How would she know? It was me who had to make all the bloody conversation with him!</p><p>\u201cNo, he doesn\u2019t! He\u2019s lived in London for months, but he hasn\u2019t bothered to see anything!\u201d I wince as I put my shoe back on. \u201cWhat kind of narrow-minded person does that? What kind of person isn\u2019t interested in one of the greatest cities in the world?\u201d My voice is rising with indignation. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t deserve to live here.\u201d</p><p>As a Londoner, I\u2019m taking this quite personally. I look up to see what Sadie thinks, but her eyes are closed and she\u2019s humming. She\u2019s not even bloody listening to me.</p><p>\u201cDo you think he\u2019d like me?\u201d She opens her eyes. \u201cIf he could see me. If he could dance with me.\u201d</p><p>Her face is so hopeful and glowing, all my outrage dies away. I\u2019m being stupid. What does it matter what this guy is like? He\u2019s got nothing to do with me. This is Sadie\u2019s evening.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say as convincingly as I can. \u201cI think he\u2019d love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so too.\u201d She looks satisfied. \u201cYour headdress is crooked, did you realize?\u201d</p><p>I tug at it and survey my reflection grumpily.</p><p>\u201cI look so ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look divine. You\u2019re the prettiest girl in the place. Apart from me,\u201d she adds airily.</p><p>\u201cDo you know how stupid I feel?\u201d I rub at my cheeks again. \u201cNo, of course not. All you care about is your date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you something,\u201d says Sadie, watching me critically in the mirror. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a film star\u2019s mouth. In my day, all the girls died to have a mouth like that. You could have been in the pictures.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah, right.\u201d I roll my eyes.</p><p>\u201cLook at yourself, you ninny. You look like a film heroine!\u201d</p><p>Reluctantly, I face the mirror again, trying to imagine myself in flickery black and white, tied to a railway line while a piano bashes out some menacing tune. Actually... she\u2019s right. I do quite look the part.</p><p>\u201cOh, sir, please spare me!\u201d I adopt a pose in front of the mirror, batting my eyelashes.</p> <p>\u201cExactly! You\u2019d have been a darling of the silver screen.\u201d Sadie meets my eyes, and I can\u2019t help grinning back. This has been the weirdest, stupidest date of my life, but somehow her mood is infectious.</p><p>As we head back out to the bar, I see that Ed is still chatting to Genevieve. She\u2019s leaning elegantly against a chair in a \u201ccasual\u201d pose, which I instantly realize is designed to show off her tall, slim figure to Ed. I also instantly realize that he hasn\u2019t even noticed, which slightly endears him to me.</p><p>Sadie\u2019s noticed, though. She keeps crossly trying to elbow Genevieve out of the way, and yelling \u201cMove!\u201d in her ear-but Genevieve\u2019s ignoring her completely. She must be made of strong stuff.</p><p>\u201cLara!\u201d Genevieve greets me with a fake smile. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I don\u2019t want to disrupt your evening \u00e1 deux with Ed!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo worries.\u201d I give her an equally fake smile.</p> <p>\u201cHave you known each other long?\u201d She gestures between Ed and me with an elegant, silk-cuffed wrist.</p><p>\u201cNot long, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo how did you two meet?\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help a surreptitious glance at Ed. He looks so uneasy at the question that I want to giggle.</p><p>\u201cIt was in the office, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d I say, to help him out.</p><p>\u201cIn the office. Yes.\u201d Ed nods in relief.</p> <p>\u201cWell!\u201d Genevieve laughs-the kind of bright, trilling laugh you give when you\u2019re really quite annoyed about something. \u201cEd, you are secretive! I had no idea you had a girlfriend!\u201d</p><p>For a split second, Ed and I meet eyes. I can see he\u2019s about as keen on that idea as I am.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not my girlfriend,\u201d he says at once. \u201cI mean, that\u2019s not-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not his girlfriend,\u201d I chime in hastily. \u201cWe\u2019re just... it\u2019s kind of a one-off-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re just having a drink,\u201d Ed supplies.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll probably never see each other again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably not,\u201d Ed affirms. \u201cDefinitely not.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019re both nodding in total agreement. In fact, I think we\u2019ve bonded for the first time.</p> <p>\u201cI... see.\u201d Genevieve looks totally confused.</p><p>\u201cLet me get you another drink, Lara.\u201d Ed gives me the warmest smile he has all evening.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ll get them!\u201d I beam back at him. There\u2019s nothing like knowing you only have to spend ten more minutes with someone to make you feel suddenly generous toward them.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d A voice is shrieking behind me, and as I turn I see Sadie heading toward me. Her glow has disappeared; she\u2019s a whirl of fury. \u201cIt\u2019s not a one-off! You made a promise!\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s got a nerve. How about \u201cThank you for dressing up and looking like a fool, Lara\u201d?</p><p>\u201cI kept my promise!\u201d I hiss out of the side of my mouth as I approach the bar. \u201cI\u2019ve done my side of the deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you haven\u2019t!\u201d She glares at me in outrage. \u201cYou haven\u2019t even danced properly with him! You\u2019ve just shuffled around dismally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo bad.\u201d I get out my phone and pretend to be speaking into that. \u201cYou said you wanted a date, I\u2019ve given you one. The end. A glass of champagne and a G &amp;T please,\u201d I add to the barman, and reach into my bag for some money. Sadie\u2019s silent, which probably means she\u2019s gearing up for a banshee moment... But as I look up, she\u2019s gone. I swivel around and see her back beside Ed.</p><p>She\u2019s yelling in his ear. Oh God. What\u2019s she doing?</p><p>I pay for the drinks as quickly as I can and hurry back across the bar. Ed is staring into the middle distance, that glazed, transfixed look on his face again. Genevieve is in the middle of an anecdote about Antigua and doesn\u2019t even seem to have noticed Ed\u2019s faraway expression. Or maybe she thinks he\u2019s transfixed by admiration for her.</p><p>\u201cAnd then I saw my bikini top!\u201d She trills with laughter. \u201cIn the sea! I never lived that one down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere you are, Ed,\u201d I say, and hand him his G &amp;T.</p><p>\u201cOh. Thanks.\u201d He seems to come to.</p><p>\u201cDo it now!\u201d Sadie suddenly swoops forward and shrieks in his ear. \u201cAsk her NOW!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ask me?

Genevieve is looking back and forth between our faces, bewildered.</p><p>\u201cSo... you are a couple,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d we reply in unison.</p><p>\u201cNo way,\u201d I add for emphasis. \u201cNot at all. I mean... never. Not in a million years.\u201d I take a sip and glance over at Ed. Is it my imagination, or does he look just the tiniest bit offended?</p><p>I last about another twenty minutes, listening to Genevieve show off about every single holiday she\u2019s ever been on, practically. Then Ed glances at me, and my empty glass, and says, \u201cDon\u2019t let me keep you.\u201d</p> <p>Don\u2019t let me keep you . It\u2019s a good thing I\u2019m not into this guy. If that isn\u2019t code for I can\u2019t stand a moment more in your company , I don\u2019t know what is.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you have dinner plans,\u201d he adds politely.</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d I say brightly. \u201cI do, as it happens. Absolutely. Dinner plans.\u201d I do a pantomime sweep of my watch in front of my eyes. \u201cGoodness, is that the time? I must run. My dinner companions will be waiting.\u201d I resist the temptation to add, \u201cAt Lyle Place, with champagne.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I have plans too.\u201d He nods. \u201cSo maybe we should...\u201d</p><p>He made dinner plans. Of course he did. He probably has a whole other, superior date lined up.</p><p>\u201cYes, let\u2019s. It\u2019s been... fun.\u201d</p><p>We both stand up, make general parting gestures at the businesspeople, and head out of the bar onto the pavement.</p><p>\u201cSo.\u201d Ed hesitates. \u201cThanks for...\u201d He makes as though to lean in for a peck on the cheek, then clearly decides against it and holds out his hand instead. \u201cThat was great. I\u2019ll let you know about the Business People dinner.\u201d</p> <p>His face is so easy to read it\u2019s almost pitiful. He\u2019s already wondering how the hell he got himself into this one-but, having invited me in front of a crowd, he can hardly back out now.</p><p>\u201cSo... I\u2019m going this way...\u201d he adds.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going the other way,\u201d I respond at once. \u201cThanks again. Bye!\u201d I quickly turn on my heel and start striding down the street. What a fiasco.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you going home so early?\u201d says Sadie crossly in my ear. \u201cYou should have suggested going to a nightclub!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have dinner plans, remember?\u201d I say pointedly. \u201cAnd so does he.\u201d I stop dead on the pavement. I was in so much of a hurry to be off, I\u2019m heading in totally the wrong direction. I turn around and look up the road, but there\u2019s no sign of Ed. He must have legged it as quickly as I did.</p><p>I\u2019m feeling pretty starving, and a bit sorry for myself. I should have made real dinner plans, I think as I head back up the road. I go into a Pret A Manger and start perusing the sandwich bar. I\u2019ll get myself a wrap and a carton of soup, and a chocolate brownie, I decide. Go all out.</p><p>I\u2019m just reaching for a smoothie when a familiar voice comes across the gentle buzz of customers.</p><p>\u201cPete. Hey, buddy. How\u2019s it going?\u201d</p><p>Sadie and I lock eyes in startled recognition.</p><p>Ed?</p><p>Instinctively I shrink back, trying to hide behind a rack of healthy crisps. My eyes scan the queues of people and land on an expensive overcoat. There he is. Buying a sandwich and talking on the phone. These are his so-called dinner plans?</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t have plans at all!\u201d I mutter. \u201cHe lied!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo did you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but...\u201d I feel slightly outraged by this.

But there are massive mirrors everywhere in this shop. He\u2019s bound to spot me. I\u2019ll have to sit it out here until he\u2019s gone.</p> <p>\u201cTell her I read the letter from the lawyer. I don\u2019t think they have a case.

It\u2019s great. It\u2019s...\u201d He sighs, and when he speaks again he sounds a little weary. \u201cC\u2019mon. It is what it is. You know that. I had a weird evening.\u201d</p><p>My hand tightens around my smoothie in anticipation. Is he going to talk about me?</p><p>\u201cI just wasted too much of my life with the most obnoxious woman in the world.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help feeling a pang of hurt. I wasn\u2019t obnoxious! OK, so I\u2019m dressed a bit differently-</p><p>\u201cYou may have met her. Genevieve Bailey? DFT?... No, it wasn\u2019t a date. I was with-\u201d He hesitates. \u201cIt was a strange situation.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m so engrossed in trying to blend into the healthy-crisp stand, I\u2019ve stopped watching Ed. But all of a sudden I\u2019m aware that he\u2019s made his purchase and is striding out of Pret, holding a takeaway bag. He\u2019s heading past me. Right past me, feet away... please don\u2019t look...</p><p>Shit .</p><p>As though he can hear my thoughts, he glances over to the right-and meets my eyes. He registers surprise but no embarrassment.</p><p>\u201cLater, buddy,\u201d he says, and slides his phone shut. \u201cHi there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Hi!\u201d I try to sound casually nonchalant, as though it was always the plan to be found lurking in Pret, clutching a wrap and a smoothie. \u201cFancy... um... seeing you here. My dinner plans... fell through.\u201d I clear my throat. \u201cAt the last minute. My friends called and canceled, so I thought I\u2019d grab a bite to eat... The wraps are great here...\u201d</p><p>Somehow I force myself to stop babbling. Why should I be embarrassed, anyway? Why isn\u2019t he embarrassed? He\u2019s been caught out as much as I have.</p> <p>\u201cSo, I thought you had dinner arrangements,\u201d I say lightly, raising my eyebrows. \u201cWhat happened to your plan? Was it canceled too? Or is it such a fancy dinner you\u2019re worried you won\u2019t get fed properly?\u201d I glance at his takeaway bag with a little laugh, waiting for him to look discomfited.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t even flicker. \u201cThis was my plan. Buy some food and get some work done. I have to fly to Amsterdam first thing tomorrow for a conference. I\u2019m giving a paper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I say, thrown.</p><p>His face is dead straight. I have a feeling he\u2019s telling the truth. Damn.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I say. \u201cWell...\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s an awkward pause, then Ed nods politely. \u201cHave a good evening.\u201d He strides out of the Pret A Manger, and I watch him go, feeling wrong-footed.</p><p>Josh would never wrong-foot me. I knew I didn\u2019t like this guy.</p><p>\u201cBig Issue?\u201d A voice interrupts my thoughts.</p> <p>\u201cOh.\u201d I focus on the skinny man in front of me. He\u2019s unshaven and wearing a woollen hat and an official Big Issue seller\u2019s badge. Feeling bad for all the times I\u2019ve walked by because it\u2019s too much hassle, I decide to make amends. \u201cI\u2019ll buy five copies,\u201d I say firmly. \u201cThanks very much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCheers, love.\u201d The man nods at my vintage outfit. \u201cNice dress.\u201d</p><p>I hand over the money and take five magazines, then pick up my supper items and head to the checkout. I\u2019m still trying to work out exactly the witty, snappy thing I should have said to Ed. I should have given a lighthearted laugh and said, \u201cNext time you make dinner plans, Ed, remind me to-\u201d</p><p>No, I should have said, \u201cReally, Ed, when you said dinner- \u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the Big Issue?\u201d Sadie\u2019s voice breaks me out of my trance. I blink a few times, feeling suddenly annoyed with myself. Why am I wasting brain space on him? Who cares what he thinks?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a street magazine,\u201d I explain. \u201cThe money goes to projects for the homeless. It\u2019s a really good cause.\u201d</p><p>I can see Sadie digesting this.</p><p>\u201cI remember people living on the streets,\u201d she says, her eyes distant. \u201cAfter the war. It seemed as though the country would never find its footing again.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, sir, you can\u2019t sell that in here.\u201d I notice a girl in uniform escorting the Big Issue seller out of the sandwich shop. \u201cWe do appreciate the work you do, but it\u2019s company policy...\u201d</p><p>I watch the man through the glass door. He seems utterly resigned to being ejected, and after a moment I can see him offering copies to passersby, all of whom ignore him.</p><p>\u201cCan I help you?\u201d I realize a cashier is calling out to me, and I hurry forward to the till. My credit card has lodged itself right at the bottom of my bag, so I take a while paying and lose track of where Sadie is.</p><p>\u201cWhat the-\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBloody hell! What\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>Suddenly I become aware that all the cashiers are exclaiming and exchanging looks. Slowly, I turn around to see what they\u2019re looking at. I don\u2019t quite believe my eyes.</p><p>There\u2019s an exodus of customers from the shop. They\u2019re all piling out onto the pavement and accosting the Big Issue seller. I can see some holding several copies in their hands, others thrusting money at him.</p><p>There\u2019s one last customer remaining in the shop. Sadie is floating next to him, her face intense, her mouth to his ear. A moment later, with a startled look, he puts down the sushi box he\u2019s holding and hurries to join the throng outside, already pulling out his wallet. Sadie just stands back and watches, her arms folded in satisfaction. After a moment she glances at me, and I can\u2019t help giving her a huge beam.</p><p>\u201cYou rock, Sadie!\u201d I mouth. The next moment she\u2019s right beside me, looking puzzled.</p> <p>\u201cDid you say I\u2019m a rock?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou rock!\u201d I pick up my bag and start walking. \u201cIt means... you\u2019re great. You did a really good thing.\u201d I gesture at the customers outside, all milling around the Big Issue seller. Passersby are now joining the crowd to see what\u2019s up, and the seller looks overwhelmed. We watch them for a moment, then turn and start heading down the street together, an easy silence between us.</p><p>\u201cYou rock too,\u201d says Sadie in a rush, and I look up in surprise.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did a good thing too. I know you didn\u2019t want to wear this dress tonight, but you did. For me.\u201d Her gaze is resolutely ahead. \u201cSo thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s OK.\u201d I shrug and take a bite of chicken wrap. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t that bad in the end.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m not going to admit it to Sadie, because then she\u2019d crow over me and be unbearable. But actually, this whole twenties look is kind of growing on me.</p><p>Kind of.</p><p>ELEVEN</p><p>Things are on the up! I feel it in my bones. Even this second date with Ed is a positive thing. One has to seize one\u2019s opportunities, like Uncle Bill said. And that\u2019s what this is all about. Going to the Business People dinner will be a great chance for me to meet loads of senior professionals, give out my card, and impress people. Natalie always said she had to be \u201cout there\u201d and keep her profile up. Well, now I\u2019ll be \u201cout there\u201d too.</p><p>\u201cKate!\u201d I say as I enter the office on Monday morning. \u201cI need all my business cards, and I need to buy one of those little holders, and I need all the back issues of Business People- \u201d I break off in surprise. She\u2019s clutching the phone with one hand and circling the air wildly with the other. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the police!\u201d She claps her hand over the receiver. \u201cThey\u2019re on the phone. They want to come and see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right.\u201d</p><p>A chunk of ice seems to descend nastily into my stomach. The police. I was hoping the police might just forget all about me.</p> <p>I glance around to see if Sadie\u2019s here, but there\u2019s no sign of her. She was talking about some vintage shop in Chelsea at breakfast time, so maybe she\u2019s gone off there.</p><p>\u201cShall I put them through?\u201d Kate is agog.</p><p>\u201cYes, why not?\u201d I try to sound confident and unconcerned, like I\u2019m someone who deals with police matters every day. Like Jane Tennison or someone. \u201cHello, Lara Lington speaking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLara, it\u2019s DC Davies here.\u201d As soon as I hear her voice, I have a flashback to myself sitting in that room, telling her I\u2019m a speed walker training for the Olympics, while she took notes, her face utterly impassive. What was I thinking?</p><p>\u201cHi! How are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m well, thanks, Lara.\u201d She\u2019s pleasant but brisk. \u201cI\u2019m in the area and was wondering if I could pop by your office for a chat. Are you free now?\u201d</p><p>Oh God. A chat? I don\u2019t want to chat.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m free.\u201d My voice has risen to a petrified squeak. \u201cLook forward to it!

Why is she following this up? Aren\u2019t the police always supposed to be chasing car fines and ignoring murders? Why couldn\u2019t they ignore this murder?</p><p>I look up to see Kate staring at me, her eyes like saucers. \u201cWhat do the police want? Are we in trouble?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no,\u201d I say quickly. \u201cNothing to worry about. It\u2019s just about my aunt\u2019s murder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMurder?\u201d Kate claps a hand over her mouth.</p> <p>I keep forgetting how murder sounds when you just drop it into a sentence.</p><p>\u201cEr... yes. So, anyway! What were you up to over the weekend?\u201d</p><p>My distraction ruse doesn\u2019t work. Kate\u2019s boggled expression doesn\u2019t change; in fact, it becomes even more boggled.</p><p>\u201cYou never told me your aunt was murdered! The aunt whose funeral you went to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm-hmm.\u201d I nod.</p> <p>\u201cNo wonder you were so upset! Oh, Lara, that\u2019s awful. How was she killed?\u201d</p><p>Oh God. I really don\u2019t want to go into the details. But I\u2019m not sure how else to get out of this conversation.</p><p>\u201cPoison,\u201d I mumble at last.</p><p>\u201cBy who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d I clear my throat. \u201cThey don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t know?\u201d Kate sounds totally outraged. \u201cWell, are they looking? Did they take fingerprints? God, the police are useless! They spend their whole time giving you parking tickets and then someone\u2019s actually murdered and they don\u2019t even care-\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think they\u2019re doing the best they can,\u201d I say hastily. \u201cThey\u2019re most likely giving me an update report. In fact, they\u2019ve probably found the culprit.\u201d</p><p>Even as I\u2019m speaking, the most horrific thought is hitting me. What if that\u2019s true?</p><p>What if DC Davies is coming here to tell me they\u2019ve found the man with the scar and the plaited beard? What do I do then?</p><p>I have a sudden image of a gaunt, bearded man with wild eyes and a scar, locked up in a police cell, banging on the door, shouting, \u201cYou\u2019ve made a mistake! I never knew the old lady!\u201d while a young police officer watches through a two-way window, folding his arms in satisfaction and saying, \u201cHe\u2019ll crack soon enough.\u201d</p><p>For a moment I feel quite hollow with guilt. What have I started?</p><p>The buzzer goes, and Kate leaps up to answer it.</p><p>\u201cShall I make some tea?\u201d she says when she\u2019s pressed the buzzer. \u201cShall I stay or go? Do you want moral support?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you go.\u201d Trying to stay calm, I push my chair back, knock over a pile of post with my elbow, and scrape my hand picking it up. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019ll all be fine , I tell myself fervently. It\u2019s no big deal .</p><p>But I can\u2019t help it. As soon as I see DC Davies walking in the door, with her clumpy shoes and sensible trousers and air of authority, I can feel my calmness disintegrating into childlike panic.</p><p>\u201cHave you found the murderer?\u201d I blurt out anxiously. \u201cHave you locked anyone up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d DC Davies says, giving me a strange look. \u201cWe haven\u2019t locked anyone up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God.\u201d I subside in relief, then realize how that might sound. \u201cI mean... why not? What are you doing all day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you some privacy,\u201d says Kate, backing out, while simultaneously mouthing \u201cUseless!\u201d behind DC Davies\u2019s back.</p><p>\u201cHave a seat.\u201d I gesture to a chair and retreat behind my desk, trying to regain a professional air. \u201cSo, how are things progressing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLara.\u201d DC Davies gives me a long, hard look. \u201cWe have conducted some preliminary inquiries, and we have found no evidence to suggest that your aunt was murdered. According to the doctor\u2019s report, she died of natural causes. Essentially, old age.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOld age?\u201d I adopt a shocked expression. \u201cWell, that\u2019s just... ludicrous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless we can find any evidence to suggest otherwise, the case will be closed. Do you have any other evidence?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm...\u201d I pause as though considering the question carefully from all sides. \u201cNot what you\u2019d call evidence . Not as such.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about this phone message you left?\u201d She pulls out a piece of paper. \u201c\u2018The nurses didn\u2019t do it.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that. Yes.\u201d I nod several times, playing for time. \u201cI realized I\u2019d got a tiny detail wrong in my statement. I just wanted to clarify things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd this \u2018man with a beard\u2019?

In so many words.</p><p>\u201cOK.\u201d I nod humbly and scribble my signature. \u201cSo what will happen now with the... the...\u201d I can hardly bring myself to say it. \u201cWhat happens to my great-aunt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe body will be handed back to the responsibility of the next of kin in due course,\u201d says DC Davies in a businesslike way. \u201cPresumably they\u2019ll then arrange another funeral.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how soon will that be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe paperwork might take a while.\u201d She zips up her bag. \u201cMaybe two weeks, maybe a little longer.\u201d</p> <p>Two weeks? I feel a jolt of horror. What if I can\u2019t find the necklace by then? Two weeks is nothing. I need more time. Sadie needs more time.</p><p>\u201cCan that be... delayed at all?\u201d I try to sound casual.</p><p>\u201cLara.\u201d DC Davies gives me a long look, then sighs. \u201cI\u2019m sure you were very fond of your great-aunt. I lost my gran last year; I know what it\u2019s like. But delaying her funeral and wasting everyone\u2019s time is not the answer.\u201d She pauses, then adds more gently, \u201cYou have to accept it. She\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe isn\u2019t!\u201d I say before I can stop myself. \u201cI mean... she needs more time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was one hundred and five.\u201d DC Davies smiles kindly. \u201cI think she had enough time, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she-\u201d I exhale in frustration. There\u2019s nothing I can say. \u201cWell... thanks for all your help.\u201d</p><p>After DC Davies has left, I sit staring blankly at my computer until I hear Sadie\u2019s voice behind me.</p><p>\u201cWhy were the police here?\u201d</p> <p>I swivel around in alarm to see her sitting on top of a filing cabinet, dressed in a low-waisted cream dress and matching cream hat with blue-black feathers sweeping around to tickle her cheek. \u201cI\u2019ve been shopping! I\u2019ve just found you the most divine little wrap. You must buy it.\u201d She adjusts her fur collar, then blinks at me. \u201cWhy were the police here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you hear our conversation at all?\u201d I ask casually.</p><p>\u201cNo. I told you, I\u2019ve been shopping.\u201d She narrows her eyes. \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d</p><p>I gaze back at her, stricken. I can\u2019t tell her the truth. I can\u2019t tell her she has only two weeks left before they\u2019re going to... before...</p><p>\u201cNothing! Just a routine visit. They wanted to check a few details. I like your hat,\u201d I add, to distract her. \u201cGo and find me a hat like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t wear a hat like this,\u201d says Sadie complacently. \u201cYou don\u2019t have the cheekbones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, a hat that would suit me, then.\u201d</p><p>Sadie\u2019s eyes widen in surprise. \u201cYou promise to buy whatever I choose? And wear it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! Of course! Go on! Shop!\u201d</p><p>As soon as she\u2019s disappeared, I yank open my desk drawer. I have to find Sadie\u2019s necklace. Now. I can\u2019t waste any more time. I pull out the list of names and rip off the back sheet.</p><p>\u201cKate,\u201d I say as she comes back into the office. \u201cNew job. We\u2019re trying to find a necklace. Long, glass beads with a dragonfly pendant. Any of these people might have bought it at a jumble sale at the Fairside Nursing Home. Can you ring this lot?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There\u2019s a tiny flicker of surprise in her eyes, then she takes the list and nods without any questions, like some loyal army lieutenant. \u201cAbsolutely!\u201d</p><p>I run my finger down past all the scribbled-out names and dial the next number. After a few rings a woman picks up.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi there! My name\u2019s Lara Lington, you don\u2019t know me...\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s two hours later before I finally put the phone down and look up wearily at Kate. \u201cAny luck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She sighs. \u201cSorry. How about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>I slump back in my chair and rub my telephone-red cheeks. My adrenaline evaporated about an hour ago. As I neared the end of the list, it was turning to a heavy kind of disappointment. We\u2019ve ruled out every single number. I don\u2019t have anywhere else to turn. What am I going to do now?</p><p>\u201cShall I go on a sandwich run?\u201d says Kate tentatively.</p> <p>\u201cOh. Yeah.\u201d I muster a smile. \u201cChicken and avocado please. Thanks so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem!\u201d She bites her lip anxiously. \u201cI hope you find it.\u201d</p><p>As she leaves, I sink my head forward and rub my aching neck. I\u2019ll just have to go back to the nursing home and ask more questions. There have to be more avenues to explore. There has to be an answer. It just doesn\u2019t make sense. The necklace was there, around Sadie\u2019s neck, and now it\u2019s gone...</p><p>A thought suddenly strikes me. That visitor she had, Charles Reece. I never followed him up. I might as well tick every box. Fishing for my mobile, I find the number for the nursing home and wearily dial.</p><p>\u201cHello, Fairside Nursing Home,\u201d answers a female voice.</p><p>\u201cHi! This is Lara Lington, Sadie Lancaster\u2019s great-niece.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, yes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just wondering... can anyone tell me anything more about a visitor she had just before she died? A Charles Reece?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a moment.\u201d</p><p>As I\u2019m waiting, I get out the sketch of the necklace and study it as though for clues. I\u2019ve looked at this picture so many times, I could practically draw each bead by heart. The more I\u2019ve got to know it, the more beautiful it seems. I can\u2019t bear it if Sadie never gets it back.</p><p>Maybe I should secretly have a copy made, I find myself thinking. An exact replica. I could get it distressed, tell Sadie it\u2019s the original, she might just fall for it-</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d A cheerful voice rouses me from my thoughts. \u201cLara? It\u2019s Sharon here, one of the nurses. I was with Sadie when Charles Reece visited; in fact, I signed him in. What do you want to know about him?\u201d</p><p>I just want to know, has he got her necklace?</p><p>\u201cWell... what exactly happened during his visit?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe sat with her for a bit, then he left. That\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn her room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d she says at once. \u201cSadie didn\u2019t really leave her room much in those last weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. So... could he have taken a necklace from her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s possible.\u201d She sounds doubtful.</p><p>It\u2019s possible. That\u2019s a start.</p><p>\u201cCan you tell me what he was like? How old was he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn his fifties or so, I\u2019d say. Nice-looking chap.\u201d</p><p>This gets more and more intriguing. Who on earth is he? Sadie\u2019s boy toy?</p><p>\u201cIf he visits again or calls, could you let me know?\u201d I scribble down Charles Reece-50s on my notepad. \u201cAnd could you get his address?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can try. Can\u2019t promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I sigh, feeling a bit dispirited. How am I ever going to track this guy down? \u201cAnd there\u2019s nothing else you can tell me about him?\u201d I add as a last-ditch attempt. \u201cNothing... distinctive? Nothing at all that you noticed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d She laughs. \u201cIt\u2019s just funny, you being called Lington.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow come?\u201d I stare at the phone, puzzled.</p><p>\u201cGinny says you\u2019re not related to that Bill Lington off the coffee cups? Millionaire bloke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr... why do you ask?\u201d I\u2019m suddenly alert.</p><p>\u201cBecause that\u2019s exactly who he looked like! I said it at the time, to the girls. Even though he had dark glasses on and a scarf, you could see it. He was the spitting image of Bill Lington.\u201d</p><p>TWELVE</p><p>It makes no sense. None. It\u2019s crazy, whichever way you look at it.</p><p>Was \u201cCharles Reece\u201d really Uncle Bill? But why would he visit Sadie? Why would he use a fake name? And why wouldn\u2019t he mention it?</p><p>And as for the idea that he might have had anything to do with her necklace disappearing... I mean, hello? He\u2019s a multimillionaire. Why would he need some old necklace? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I feel like banging my head against the window, to make all the pieces fall into place. But since at this very minute I\u2019m sitting in a plushy chauffeur-driven limo provided by Uncle Bill, I probably won\u2019t. Just to get this far has been a total hassle. I don\u2019t want to jeopardize things.</p><p>I\u2019ve never phoned up Uncle Bill in my life, so at first I wasn\u2019t sure how to get in touch with him. (Obviously I couldn\u2019t ask Mum and Dad, or they\u2019d want to know why I needed to see Uncle Bill and why had I been visiting Sadie\u2019s nursing home and what was I talking about, what necklace?) So I rang Lingtons head office, eventually persuaded someone that I was for real, got through to one of the assistants, and asked if I could make an appointment to see Uncle Bill.</p><p>It was as if I\u2019d asked to see the president. Within the hour, about six assistants started sending me emails, coordinating a time, changing the time, changing the location, organizing a car, asking me to bring ID, telling me I couldn\u2019t overrun my slot, asking what Lingtons beverage I\u2019d prefer in the car...</p><p>All for a ten-minute meeting.</p> <p>The car is pretty rock-star, I have to admit. It\u2019s got two rows of seats facing each other and a TV, and a chilled strawberry smoothie was waiting for me, just like I asked for. I\u2019d be more grateful, except that Dad once said Uncle Bill always sends cars for people so that the minute he\u2019s had enough of them he can send them away again.</p><p>\u201cWilliam and Michael,\u201d Sadie pipes up thoughtfully from the seat opposite. \u201cI left everything to those boys in my will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right.\u201d I nod. \u201cYes, I think I heard that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I hope they were grateful. There must have been a fair amount.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLoads!\u201d I lie hastily, remembering a conversation I once heard between Mum and Dad. Apparently everything was swallowed up by the nursing-home fees, but Sadie wouldn\u2019t want to hear that. \u201cAnd they were really thrilled.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo they should be.\u201d She sits back in satisfaction. A moment later the car pulls off the road and approaches a pair of enormous gates. As the car stops by the gatehouse and a security guard approaches, Sadie peers past me at the mansion.</p><p>\u201cGoodness.\u201d She looks at me uncertainly, as though someone must be playing a joke. \u201cThat\u2019s a rather large house. How on earth did he become so rich?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you,\u201d I say under my breath, as I give my passport to the driver. He hands it to the security guard, and they confer as though I\u2019m some sort of terrorist.</p><p>\u201cYou said he ran coffee shops.\u201d Sadie wrinkles her nose.</p><p>\u201cYes. Thousands of them. All around the world. He\u2019s really famous.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a pause, then Sadie says, \u201cI should have liked to be famous.\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s a trace of wistfulness in her voice, and I open my mouth to say automatically, \u201cMaybe you will be one day!\u201d Then, as the truth hits me, I close it again, feeling a bit sad. There isn\u2019t a \u201cone day\u201d for her anymore, is there?</p><p>By now the car is purring up the drive, and I can\u2019t help gazing out of the window like a child. I\u2019ve only been to Uncle Bill\u2019s mansion a few times in my life, and I always forget how impressive and intimidating it is. It\u2019s a Georgian house with about fifteen bedrooms and a basement with two swimming pools in it. Two .</p><p>I\u2019m not going to get nervous , I tell myself firmly. It\u2019s just a house. He\u2019s just a person .</p><p>But, oh God . Everything\u2019s so grand. There are lawns everywhere and fountains sprinkling, and gardeners snipping hedges. As we approach the entrance, a tall guy in a black suit and shades with a discreet earpiece is coming down the spotless white steps to greet me.</p><p>\u201cLara.\u201d He clasps my hand as though we\u2019re old friends. \u201cI\u2019m Damian. I work for Bill. He\u2019s looking forward to seeing you. I\u2019ll take you round to the office wing.\u201d As we start to crunch over the gravel, he adds lightly, \u201cWhat exactly was it you wanted to talk to Bill about? Nobody seems very clear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s... um... private. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d He flashes a smile. \u201cGreat. Just approaching, Sarah,\u201d he says into his earpiece.</p><p>The side building is as impressive as the main house, just in a different style, all glass and modern art and a stainless-steel water feature. As if by clockwork, a girl comes out to greet us, also dressed immaculately in a black suit.</p> <p>\u201cHi, Lara. Welcome. I\u2019m Sarah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll leave you here, Lara.\u201d Damian flashes me his teeth again and crunches back over the gravel.</p><p>\u201cSo, it\u2019s an honor to meet Bill\u2019s niece!\u201d says Sarah as she leads me into the building. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh. Well... er, thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if Damian mentioned this.\u201d Sarah ushers me to a seat and sits down opposite me. \u201cBut I was wondering if you could tell me the subjects you\u2019d like to discuss with Bill. It\u2019s something we ask all his visitors. So we can prep him, do any necessary research... It makes life easier for everyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamian did ask. But it\u2019s kind of private, sorry.\u201d</p><p>Sarah\u2019s pleasant smile doesn\u2019t falter for an instant.</p> <p>\u201cIf you could just indicate the broad areas? Give us an idea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really want to get into it.\u201d I can feel myself flushing. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s kind of a... family thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course! That\u2019s fine. Excuse me a moment.\u201d</p><p>She moves away into a corner of the reception area, and I can see her muttering into her earpiece. Sadie glides over to Sarah for a minute or two, then appears back by my side. To my astonishment, she\u2019s cracking up with laughter.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d I demand under my breath. \u201cWhat was she saying?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe said she didn\u2019t think you looked violent but maybe they should call extra security anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I can\u2019t help exclaiming, and Sarah immediately whips around to survey me.</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d I wave at her cheerily. \u201cJust... er... sneezed. What else did she say?\u201d I hiss as Sarah turns away again.</p><p>\u201cApparently you have a grudge against Bill? Something about a job he didn\u2019t give you?\u201d</p><p>Grudge? Job? I stare at her baffled for a second-before the penny drops. The funeral. Of course .</p><p>\u201cThe last time Uncle Bill saw me, I was announcing a murder in the middle of a funeral. He must have told everyone I\u2019m a total psychopath!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it a wheeze?\u201d Sadie giggles.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not funny!\u201d I say crossly. \u201cThey probably all think I\u2019ve come to assassinate him or something! You realize this is all your fault?\u201d I hastily break off as Sarah approaches again.</p><p>\u201cHi, Lara!\u201d Her voice is bright but tense. \u201cSo... one of Bill\u2019s team will sit in with you during the meeting. Just to take notes. Is that OK?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook. Sarah.\u201d I try to sound as sane and calm as possible. \u201cI\u2019m not a nutter. I don\u2019t have a grudge against anyone. I don\u2019t need any notes taken. I just want to have a chat with my uncle, one to one. Five minutes. That\u2019s all I want.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s silence for a moment. Sarah still has a vivid smile pasted on, but her eyes keep swiveling to the door and back again.</p><p>\u201cOK, Lara,\u201d she says at last. \u201cWe\u2019ll do things your way.\u201d</p><p>As she sits down, I can see her touching her earpiece as though for reassurance.</p><p>\u201cSo... how\u2019s Aunt Trudy?\u201d I say conversationally. \u201cIs she here?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTrudy\u2019s at the house in France for a few days,\u201d Sarah says at once.</p><p>\u201cHow about Diamant\u00e9? Maybe we could have a quick coffee or something.\u201d I don\u2019t really want to have coffee with Diamant\u00e9, I only want to prove how friendly and normal I am.</p><p>\u201cYou want to see Diamant\u00e9?\u201d Sarah\u2019s eyes have gone even more swively. \u201cNow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust for a coffee, if she\u2019s around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call her assistant.\u201d She leaps up, hurries away to the corner, and mutters in her earpiece, then almost immediately comes back to the seating area. \u201cI\u2019m afraid Diamant\u00e9\u2019s getting a manicure at the moment. She says maybe next time?\u201d</p><p>Yeah, right. She never even put the call through. I\u2019m feeling quite sorry for this Sarah, actually. She looks as nervous as if she\u2019s babysitting a lion. I have a wicked urge to yell \u201cHands up!\u201d and see how quickly she throws herself to the floor.</p><p>\u201cI love your bracelet,\u201d I say instead. \u201cIt\u2019s really unusual.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d She extends her arm warily and shakes the two little silver disks on their chain. \u201cHaven\u2019t you seen these yet? They\u2019re from the new Two Little Coins line. There\u2019s going to be a stand of products in each Lingtons coffee shop starting next January. I\u2019m sure Bill will give you one. There\u2019s a pendant, too, and T-shirts... gift sets of two little coins in a treasure box...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds great,\u201d I say politely. \u201cIt must be doing well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Two Little Coins is huge,\u201d she assures me earnestly. \u201cHuge. It\u2019ll be as big a brand as Lingtons. You know it\u2019s going to be a Hollywood film?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d I nod. \u201cPierce Brosnan as Uncle Bill, I heard.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd of course the reality show will be a big hit. It\u2019s such an empowering message. I mean, anyone can follow Bill\u2019s path.\u201d Sarah\u2019s eyes are shining, and she seems to have forgotten all about being scared of me. \u201cAnyone can pick up two little coins and decide to change their future. And you can apply it to families, businesses, economies... You know, lots of really senior politicians have called Bill since the book came out. They\u2019re, like, how can we apply your secret to our country?\u201d She lowers her voice reverentially. \u201cIncluding the President of the United States.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe president phoned Uncle Bill?\u201d I\u2019m awed, in spite of myself.</p><p>\u201cHis people.\u201d She shrugs and shakes her bracelet out. \u201cWe all think Bill should get into politics himself. He has so much to offer the world. It\u2019s such a privilege to work for him.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s totally signed up for the cult. I glance at Sadie, who has been yawning throughout Sarah\u2019s speech.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going to explore,\u201d she announces, and before I can say anything, she\u2019s disappeared.</p><p>\u201cOK.\u201d Sarah\u2019s listening to her earpiece. \u201cOn our way. Bill\u2019s ready to see you, Lara.\u201d</p><p>She gets up and beckons me to follow. We make our way down a corridor lined with what look suspiciously like real Picassos, then pause in another, smaller reception area. I tug at my skirt and take a few deep breaths. It\u2019s ridiculous to feel nervous. I mean, this is my uncle. I have a right to see him. There\u2019s no need to feel anything except relaxed-</p><p>I can\u2019t help it. My legs are wobbling.</p><p>I think it\u2019s because the doors are so big. They\u2019re not like normal doors. They tower up to the ceiling, great blocks of pale polished wood that swing open silently every now and again as people come in and out.</p> <p>\u201cIs that Uncle Bill\u2019s office?\u201d I nod at the door.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the outer office.\u201d Sarah smiles. \u201cYou\u2019ll be seeing him in the inner office.\u201d She listens to her earpiece again, suddenly alert, then murmurs, \u201cBringing her in now.\u201d</p><p>She pushes open one of the tall doors and leads me through an airy, glass-walled office space with a couple of cool-looking guys at workstations, one of whom is wearing a Two Little Coins T-shirt. They both look up and smile politely but don\u2019t stop typing. We reach another set of giant doors and pause. Sarah glances at her watch-then, as though timing it to the second, knocks and pushes the door open.</p><p>It\u2019s a vast, light room with a vaulted ceiling and a glass sculpture on a podium and a sunken seating area. Six men in suits are getting up from chairs, as though finishing a meeting. And there, behind his massive desk, is Uncle Bill, looking lithe in a gray polo neck and jeans. He\u2019s more tanned than he was at the funeral, his hair as glossy black as ever, and he\u2019s cradling a Lingtons coffee mug in one hand.</p><p>\u201cThanks very much for your time, Bill,\u201d one of the men is saying fervently. \u201cWe appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>Uncle Bill doesn\u2019t even reply, just lifts a hand like the pope. As the men file out, three girls in black uniforms appear from nowhere and clear the table of coffee cups in about thirty seconds flat, while Sarah ushers me forward to a chair.</p> <p>All of a sudden she looks nervous too.</p><p>\u201cYour niece Lara,\u201d she murmurs to Uncle Bill. \u201cShe wants a one to one. Damian made the decision to give her five minutes, but we don\u2019t have any prep notes. We have Ted standing by.\u201d Sarah lowers her voice further. \u201cI can call extra security-\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Sarah, we\u2019ll be fine.\u201d Uncle Bill cuts her off and turns his attention to me. \u201cLara. Have a seat.\u201d</p><p>As I sit down, I\u2019m aware of Sarah moving away and the soft swoosh of the door closing behind me.</p><p>There\u2019s silence, apart from Uncle Bill tapping something into his BlackBerry. To pass the time, I look at the wall of pictures of Uncle Bill with famous people. Madonna. Nelson Mandela. The whole England football team.</p><p>\u201cSo, Lara.\u201d At last he looks up. \u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI... um...\u201d I clear my throat. \u201cI was...\u201d</p><p>I had all sorts of punchy openers prepared. But now that I\u2019m actually here, in the inner sanctum, they\u2019re all drying up on my lips. I feel paralyzed. This is Bill Lington we\u2019re talking about. Huge, jet-setting tycoon with a million important things to do, like telling the president how to run his country. Why would he go to an old people\u2019s home and take a necklace from an old lady? What have I been thinking?</p> <p>\u201cLara?\u201d He frowns questioningly</p><p>Oh God. If I\u2019m going to do this, I need to do it. It\u2019s like jumping off the diving board. Hold your nose, deep breath, go. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI went to Aunt Sadie\u2019s nursing home last week,\u201d I say in a rush. \u201cAnd apparently she had this visitor a few weeks ago who looked just like you, called Charles Reece, and it didn\u2019t make any sense to me, so I thought I\u2019d come and ask you...\u201d</p><p>I trail off. Uncle Bill is looking at me with as much enthusiasm as if I\u2019d whipped out a hula skirt and started dancing.</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ,\u201d he mutters. \u201cLara, are you still claiming Sadie was murdered? Is that what this is about? Because I really don\u2019t have time-\u201d He reaches for the telephone.</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s not it!\u201d My face is boiling, but I force myself to persevere. \u201cI don\u2019t really think she was murdered. I went there because... because I felt bad that no one had ever shown any interest in her. When she was alive, I mean. And there was another name in the visitors\u2019 book, and they said the guy looked exactly like you, and I was just... wondering. You know. Just wondering.\u201d</p> <p>My heart is pounding in my ears as I finish.</p><p>Slowly, Uncle Bill replaces the telephone receiver and there\u2019s silence. For a few moments he looks as though he\u2019s weighing up exactly what to say.</p><p>\u201cWell, it looks as though both of us had the same instincts,\u201d he says at last, leaning back in his chair. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I did go to see Sadie.\u201d</p><p>My jaw drops in astonishment.</p><p>Result! Total, instant result! I think I should become a private detective.</p> <p>\u201cBut why did you use the name Charles Reece?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLara.\u201d Uncle Bill gives a patient sigh. \u201cI have a lot of fans out there. I\u2019m a celebrity. There are a lot of things I do that I don\u2019t trumpet. Charity work, hospital visits...\u201d He spreads his hands. \u201cCharles Reece is the name I take when I want to stay anonymous. Can you imagine the fuss if it were known that Bill Lington had personally come to visit an old lady?\u201d He meets my eyes with a friendly twinkle, and for a moment I can\u2019t help smiling back.</p><p>It kind of makes sense. Uncle Bill is such a rock star. Taking a pseudonym is the sort of thing he\u2019d do.</p><p>\u201cBut why didn\u2019t you tell any of the family? At the service, you said you\u2019d never visited Aunt Sadie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Uncle Bill nods. \u201cAnd I had my reasons for that. I didn\u2019t want to make the rest of the family feel in any way guilty or defensive about not having visited themselves. Especially your father. He can be... prickly.\u201d</p><p>Prickly? Dad\u2019s not prickly.</p> <p>\u201cDad\u2019s fine,\u201d I say tightly.</p><p>\u201cOh, he\u2019s great,\u201d Bill says immediately. \u201cAn absolutely fantastic guy. But it can\u2019t be easy being Bill Lington\u2019s big brother. I feel for him.\u201d</p><p>Indignation surges through me. He\u2019s right. It\u2019s not easy being Bill Lington\u2019s big brother, because Bill Lington is such an arrogant tosser .</p><p>I should never have smiled at him. In fact, I wish there were a way to take smiles back.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to feel sorry for Dad,\u201d I say as politely as I can. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t feel sorry for himself. He\u2019s done really well in life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, I\u2019ve started using your dad as an example in my seminars.\u201d Uncle Bill adopts a musing tone. \u201cTwo boys. Same upbringing. Same education. The only difference between them was, one of them wanted it. One of them had the dream.\u201d</p><p>He sounds like he\u2019s rehearsing a speech for some promotional DVD. God, he\u2019s up himself. Who says everyone wants to be Bill Lington, anyway? Some people\u2019s dream would be not to have their face plastered across coffee cups all over the world.</p><p>\u201cSo, Lara.\u201d He focuses back on me. \u201cIt was a pleasure to see you; Sarah will show you out.\u201d</p> <p>That\u2019s it? My audience is over? I haven\u2019t even got to the bit about the necklace yet.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something else,\u201d I say hastily.</p><p>\u201cLara-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be really quick, I promise! I just wondered, when you visited Aunt Sadie...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d I can see him trying to keep his patience. He glances at his watch and touches a key on his keyboard.</p><p>Oh God. How am I going to put this?</p><p>\u201cDo you know anything about...\u201d I\u2019m stumbling over my words. \u201cI mean, did you see... or possibly take, by accident... a necklace? A long necklace with glass beads and a dragonfly pendant?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m expecting another patronizing sigh, a blank look, and a dismissive comment. I\u2019m not expecting him to freeze. I\u2019m not expecting his eyes to become suddenly sharp and wary.</p><p>As I stare back, I feel almost breathless with shock. He knows what I\u2019m talking about. He knows . </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The very next moment, the wariness has disappeared out of his eyes and he\u2019s back to empty politeness. I could almost think I imagined that other expression.</p><p>\u201cA necklace?\u201d He takes a sip of coffee and types something at his keyboard. \u201cDo you mean something of Sadie\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>The back of my neck is prickling all over. What\u2019s going on? I saw the recognition in his eyes, I know I did. Why is he pretending he doesn\u2019t know about it?</p><p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s an old piece I\u2019m trying to track down.\u201d Some instinct tells me to act cool and unconcerned. \u201cThe nurses at the home said it had disappeared, so...\u201d I watch Uncle Bill sharply for a reaction, but his bland mask is perfectly in place.</p> <p>\u201cInteresting. Why do you want it?\u201d he asks lightly.</p><p>\u201cOh, no particular reason. I just saw a photo of Sadie wearing it at her hundred and fifth birthday and I thought it would be nice to find it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFascinating.\u201d He pauses. \u201cCan I see the photo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t got it on me, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d</p><p>This conversation is so weird. It feels like a game of tennis, where we\u2019re both lobbing balls very gently into the air and resisting the urge to wallop a winner.</p> <p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d Uncle Bill puts his mug down with an air of finality. \u201cI\u2019m pressed for time, so we\u2019ll have to leave it there.\u201d</p><p>He pushes back his chair but I don\u2019t move. He knows something about it. I\u2019m sure he does. But what do I do? What options do I have?</p><p>\u201cLara?\u201d He\u2019s standing by my chair, waiting. Reluctantly I get to my feet. As we approach the door, it opens as though by magic. We\u2019re greeted by Sarah, with Damian hovering behind, his BlackBerry out.</p><p>\u201cAll done?\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cAll done.\u201d Uncle Bill nods firmly. \u201cGive my best to your dad, won\u2019t you, Lara? Good-bye.\u201d</p><p>Sarah puts a hand to my elbow and starts gently edging me out of the room. My chance is ebbing away. In desperation, I grip onto the door frame.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a shame about the necklace, don\u2019t you think?\u201d I look directly at Uncle Bill, trying to provoke a response. \u201cWhat do you think happened to it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLara, I\u2019d forget about the necklace,\u201d says Uncle Bill smoothly. \u201cIt was probably lost a long time ago. Damian, come in.\u201d</p><p>Damian hurries past me, and the two men head to the other side of the room. The door is already closing. I stare after Uncle Bill, almost exploding with frustration.</p><p>What\u2019s going on? What is it with this necklace?</p><p>I need to speak to Sadie, right now. This minute. I swivel my head back and forth, but there\u2019s no sign of her. Typical. She\u2019s probably found some hunky gardener to lust after.</p><p>\u201cLara,\u201d says Sarah with a tense smile. \u201cCould you please remove your fingers from the door frame? We can\u2019t close the door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right!\u201d I say, lifting up my hands. \u201cDon\u2019t panic! I\u2019m not going to stage a sit-in protest!\u201d</p><p>Sarah\u2019s eyes jump in fear at the word protest , which she immediately covers with a fake little laugh. She should really give up working for Uncle Bill. She\u2019s way too nervous.</p> <p>\u201cYour car is waiting for you at the front. I\u2019ll take you there now.\u201d</p><p>Damn. If she escorts me out, there\u2019s no way I can sidle off or poke around any drawers or anything.</p><p>\u201cA coffee for the ride?\u201d asks Sarah as we pass through the lobby.</p><p>I quell an urge to say, \u201cYes, please, a Starbucks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks.\u201d I smile.</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s been so great to see you, Lara!\u201d Her fake gushiness makes me wince. \u201cCome back soon!\u201d</p><p>Yeah, right. By which you mean \u201cplease never set foot in this place again, ever.\u201d</p><p>The limo driver opens the door, and I\u2019m about to step in when Sadie appears right in front of me, blocking the way. Her hair is a little disheveled and she\u2019s breathing hard.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve found it!\u201d she says dramatically.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I stop, foot halfway into the car.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s in the house! I saw it in a bedroom upstairs, on a dressing table! It\u2019s here! My necklace is here!\u201d</p><p>I stare at her, gripped. I knew it, I knew it!</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re absolutely sure it\u2019s yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m sure!\u201d Her voice rises shrilly and she starts gesturing at the house. \u201cI could have picked it up! I tried to pick it up! Of course, I couldn\u2019t...\u201d She clicks her tongue in frustration.</p><p>\u201cLara, is there a problem?\u201d Sarah is hurrying down the stairs again. \u201cIs there something wrong with the car? Neville, is everything OK?\u201d she snaps at the driver. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cEverything\u2019s fine!\u201d he replies defensively, and jerks his head at me. \u201cShe just started talking to thin air.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you like a different car, Lara?\u201d I can see it\u2019s taking Sarah a supreme effort to keep up her pleasant manner. \u201cOr to go to a different location? Neville can take you anywhere. Perhaps you\u2019d like the use of him for the rest of the day?\u201d</p><p>She really, really wants to get rid of me.</p><p>\u201cThis car\u2019s fine, thanks,\u201d I say brightly. \u201cGet in the car,\u201d I mutter to Sadie out of the side of my mouth. \u201cCan\u2019t talk here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d Sarah frowns.</p><p>\u201cJust... on the phone. Tiny earpiece.\u201d I tap my ear and quickly slide into the car.</p><p>The car door clunks and we glide away toward the gates. I check that the glass partition is closed, then flop back and look at Sadie.</p><p>\u201cThis is unbelievable! How did you find it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just went looking.\u201d She shrugs. \u201cI looked in all the cupboards and the drawers and the safe-\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou went in Uncle Bill\u2019s safe?\u201d I\u2019m agog. \u201cWow. What\u2019s in there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBits of paper and hideous jewels,\u201d says Sadie impatiently. \u201cI was about to give up, when I walked past a dressing table and there it was.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t believe it. I\u2019m popping with anger. Uncle Bill just sat in front of me and said he didn\u2019t know anything about any dragonfly necklace. He\u2019s a lying ... liar . We have to make an action plan. As quickly as I can, I reach inside my bag for a notebook and pen.</p><p>\u201cSomething\u2019s going on,\u201d I say, writing Action Plan at the top of a page. \u201cThere has to be a reason he took it and a reason he\u2019s lying.\u201d I rub my brow in frustration. \u201cBut what? Why is it so important to him? Do you know anything else about it? Does it have some kind of history... or collectors\u2019 value-\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this all you\u2019re going to do?\u201d Sadie\u2019s voice explodes. \u201cTalk, talk, drone, drone? We need to get it! You need to climb through the window and get it! At once!\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr...\u201d I look up from my notebook.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be quite easy,\u201d Sadie adds confidently. \u201cYou can take off your shoes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m nodding. But truth be told, I don\u2019t feel absolutely prepared for this. Break in to Uncle Bill\u2019s house right now? Without making a plan?</p><p>\u201cThe only thing is,\u201d I venture after a moment, \u201che\u2019s got lots of security guards and alarms and stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what?\u201d Sadie\u2019s eyes narrow. \u201cAre you frightened of a few alarms?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I say at once. \u201cOf course not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet you are!\u201d she cries derisively. \u201cI\u2019ve never known such a ninny in all my life! You won\u2019t smoke because it\u2019s dangerous! You wear a safety belt in the motor because it\u2019s dangerous! You won\u2019t eat butter because it\u2019s dangerous!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think butter\u2019s dangerous,\u201d I retort indignantly. \u201cIt\u2019s just, you know, olive oil spread has got better fats...\u201d</p> <p>I trail off at the contemptuous look on Sadie\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to climb in through the window and get my necklace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say, after only a split-second pause. \u201cOf course I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, come on, then! Stop the car!\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop bossing me about!\u201d I say resentfully. \u201cI was just about to.\u201d</p><p>I lean forward and open the glass partition between us and the driver. \u201cExcuse me? I\u2019m feeling carsick. Could you let me out, please? I\u2019ll go home by tube. I\u2019m not dissing your driving or anything,\u201d I add hastily, as I see him frowning into the rearview mirror. \u201cYou\u2019re great. Really... er... smooth action.\u201d</p><p>The car pulls over and the driver looks around dubiously. \u201cI\u2019m supposed to take you home to your door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry!\u201d I say, clambering out. \u201cHonestly, I just need some fresh air, thanks so much...\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m already on the pavement. I bang the door shut and give the driver a little wave. He shoots me one last suspicious glance, then does a three-point turn and heads back toward Uncle Bill\u2019s house. As soon as he\u2019s out of sight, I start retracing my path, keeping unobtrusively to the side of the road. I round the corner, see Uncle Bill\u2019s gates ahead, and pause.</p><p>The gates are closed and they\u2019re massive. The security guard is there in his glass box. CCTV cameras are everywhere. You don\u2019t just march straight in to Uncle Bill\u2019s house. I need a strategy. I take a deep breath and approach the gates, looking as innocent as possible. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHi! It\u2019s me again, Lara Lington,\u201d I say into the pedestrian intercom. \u201cI left my umbrella behind. Silly me!\u201d After a moment, the guard opens the pedestrian gate for me and leans out of his window.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve spoken to Sarah. She doesn\u2019t know anything about an umbrella, but she\u2019s coming down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll meet her, save her the trouble!\u201d I say brightly, and hurry past before he can protest. OK. I\u2019m past one hurdle.</p><p>\u201cTell me the minute he looks away,\u201d I mutter to Sadie out of the side of my mouth. \u201cSay \u2018Now.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNow!\u201d she says suddenly, and I dodge to the side of the path. I take a few steps across the grass, then drop down, roll behind a hedge, and come to a stop like someone in an action film.</p><p>My heart\u2019s thumping hard. I don\u2019t even care that I\u2019ve run my tights. Through the hedge I can see Sarah crunching swiftly down the drive, a perturbed expression on her face.</p><p>\u201cWhere is she?\u201d I hear her voice drifting up from the front gates.</p><p>\u201c... saw her a moment ago...\u201d The guard sounds baffled.</p><p>Ha!</p> <p>Actually, not ha. They might start looking for me with Rottweilers in a minute.</p><p>\u201cWhere is it?\u201d I whisper to Sadie. \u201cGuide me. And keep a lookout!\u201d</p><p>We start making our way over the lawn toward the house, dodging from hedge to water feature to prizewinning sculpture. I keep freezing as people walk down the drive. But so far no one\u2019s spotted me.</p><p>\u201cThere!\u201d We turn the corner and Sadie nods at a set of French doors on the second-floor level. They\u2019re ajar, and open onto a terrace with steps up to it from the garden. I won\u2019t need to clamber up the ivy after all. I\u2019m almost disappointed.</p><p>\u201cKeep guard!\u201d I mutter to Sadie. I creep toward the steps, slip off my wedges, and run up them silently. Cautiously, I approach the ajar French doors-and catch my breath.</p><p>There it is.</p> <p>It\u2019s lying on a dressing table, just inside the room. A long double row of beads in shimmering yellow glass, with the most exquisite carved dragonfly, inlaid with mother-of-pearl and studded with rhinestones. It\u2019s Sadie\u2019s necklace. Iridescent and magical, just as she described it, although it\u2019s longer than I imagined and a few of the beads are a little battered.</p><p>As I gaze at it, I feel overcome by emotion. After all this time. After all the hunting, the hoping; after secretly wondering if it even existed anymore... here it is. Only a few feet away from me. I could practically lean over and touch it without even entering the room.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s... stunning.\u201d I turn back to Sadie, my voice a little choked. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely the most beautiful thing I\u2019ve ever-\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet it!\u201d She\u2019s whirling her arms in frustration, her beads jangling. \u201cStop talking! Get it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK, OK!\u201d</p><p>I swing the French doors open, take a tentative step inside, and am just reaching toward the necklace, when I hear footsteps approaching the room. In what seems like a nanosecond, the door is thrown open. Shit. Someone\u2019s coming in.</p><p>In panic, I reverse onto the terrace and duck to one side.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d demands Sadie from below. \u201cGet the necklace!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s in there! I\u2019ll wait \u2019til they\u2019ve gone!\u201d</p><p>In an instant, Sadie is up on the terrace and poking her head through the glass into the room.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a maid.\u201d She glares at me. \u201cYou should have grabbed it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get it in a minute when she\u2019s gone! Don\u2019t stress! Just keep a lookout!\u201d</p><p>I back right against the wall, praying that the maid or whoever she is doesn\u2019t decide to come out on the terrace for a breath of fresh air and madly thinking of excuses if she does.</p><p>Suddenly my heart jumps as the French doors start moving-but they\u2019re not opening. They close with a firm clunk . The next thing I hear is the click of a key being turned.</p><p>Oh no.</p><p>Oh no, oh no.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s locked you out!\u201d Sadie darts into the room, then out again. \u201cNow she\u2019s gone! You\u2019re stuck! You\u2019re stuck!\u201d</p><p>I rattle the French doors, but they\u2019re well and firmly locked.</p><p>\u201cYou idiot!\u201d Sadie is beside herself with fury. \u201cYou absolute fool! Why didn\u2019t you just grab it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was about to!\u201d I retort defensively. \u201cYou should have gone to check if anyone was coming!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, what are we going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know! I don\u2019t know !\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s silence as we face each other, panting slightly.</p><p>\u201cI need to put my shoes on,\u201d I say at last. I head down the steps and slip on my wedges. Above, Sadie is still darting in and out of the room in frustration, as though she can\u2019t bear to relinquish her necklace. At last she gives up and joins me on the grass. For a few moments neither of us meets the other\u2019s eye. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I wasn\u2019t quicker at grabbing it,\u201d I mumble at last.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d says Sadie, clearly making a supreme effort. \u201cI suppose it wasn\u2019t completely your fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go around the house. We may be able to slip in somewhere. Go inside and see if the coast is clear.\u201d</p><p>As Sadie disappears, I creep cautiously over the grass and start moving along the wall of the house. I\u2019m making slow progress, because every time I pass a window I duck down and crawl on my stomach. Although that won\u2019t exactly help if one of the security guards comes along-</p> <p>\u201cThere you are!\u201d Sadie pops out of the wall beside me. \u201cGuess what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus!\u201d I clasp my chest. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your uncle! I\u2019ve been watching him! He\u2019s just been to his safe in his bedroom. He looked in it, but he couldn\u2019t find what he wanted. Then he banged it shut and started shouting for Diamant\u00e9. The girl. Odd name.\u201d She wrinkles her nose.</p><p>\u201cMy cousin.\u201d I nod. \u201cAnother of your great-nieces.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was in the kitchen. He said he needed a private word and sent all the staff away. Then he demanded, had she been going in his safe and taking things? Then he said an old necklace was missing and did she know anything about it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh my God.\u201d I stare back at her. \u201cOh my God! What did she say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe said no, but he didn\u2019t believe her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe she\u2019s lying.\u201d My mind is working overtime. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s her bedroom, where the necklace was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly! So we have to get it now, before he realizes where it is and locks it away again. There\u2019s no one around. All the staff have got out of the way. We can go through the house.\u201d</p><p>I haven\u2019t got time to think about whether this is a good idea or not. My heart pumping, I follow Sadie to a side door and in through a laundry room as big as my whole flat. She beckons me through a pair of swing doors, down a passage, then holds up a hand as we reach the hall, her eyes widening warily. I can hear Uncle Bill shouting, his voice increasing in volume.</p><p>\u201c... private safe... personal security... how dare you... code was for emergencies only...\u201d</p> <p>\u201c... not bloody fair! You never let me have anything!\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s Diamant\u00e9\u2019s voice, and it\u2019s getting closer. On instinct, I dart behind a chair and sink down, my knees trembling. The next moment she strides into the hall, wearing a strange asymmetrical pink miniskirt and a teeny-tiny T-shirt.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll buy you a necklace.\u201d Uncle Bill comes striding in after her. \u201cThat\u2019s no problem. Tell me what you need, Damian will find it-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou always say that!\u201d she shrieks at him. \u201cYou never listen! That necklace is perfect! I need it for my next Tutus and Pearls show! My whole new collection is based on butterflies and insects and stuff! I\u2019m a creative , in case you hadn\u2019t realized-\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re so creative, my love,\u201d says Uncle Bill with a sarcastic edge, \u201cwhy have I hired three designers to work on your dresses?\u201d</p><p>For a moment I\u2019m gobsmacked. Diamant\u00e9 uses other designers? The next minute I can\u2019t believe I didn\u2019t work that one out before.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re... fucking ... assistants!\u201d she screams back. \u201cIt\u2019s my vision! And I need that necklace-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not using it, Diamant\u00e9.\u201d Uncle Bill\u2019s voice is ominous. \u201cAnd you\u2019re never going in my safe again. You\u2019re going to give it back to me right now-\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not! And you can tell Damian to fuck off, he\u2019s a git.\u201d She runs up the stairs, closely followed by Sadie.</p><p>Uncle Bill looks so furious, it\u2019s as though he\u2019s not quite in possession of his faculties. He\u2019s breathing heavily and thrusting his hands through his hair as he gazes up the grand staircase. He looks so uncool and out of control, I almost want to giggle.</p><p>\u201cDiamant\u00e9!\u201d he shouts. \u201cYou come back here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck off!\u201d comes a distant cry.</p><p>\u201cDiamant\u00e9!\u201d Uncle Bill starts to stride up the stairs himself. \u201cThat\u2019s it. I won\u2019t have this-\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s got it!\u201d Sadie\u2019s voice is suddenly in my ear. \u201cShe\u2019s taken it! We need to catch her! You go round the back. I\u2019ll guard the front stairs.\u201d</p><p>With scrambling legs I get to my feet, run back down the passage, through the laundry room, and out onto the lawn. I sprint breathlessly around the house, not caring if anyone sees me-and stop dead in dismay. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Shit .</p><p>Diamant\u00e9 is in a black, open-top Porsche, heading down the gravel at speed toward the front gates, which are hastily being opened by the security guard.</p><p>\u201cNoooo!\u201d I wail before I can stop myself.</p><p>As Diamant\u00e9 pauses to exit, she flicks a V-sign back at the house and the next minute is out on the street. In her other hand I can just see Sadie\u2019s necklace, wrapped around her fingers, glinting in the sunshine.</p> <p>THIRTEEN</p><p>There\u2019s only one possibility: They\u2019re not rhinestones, they\u2019re diamonds. The necklace is studded with rare antique diamonds and worth millions of pounds. It\u2019s got to be that. There\u2019s no other reason I can think of that Uncle Bill would be so interested in it.</p><p>I\u2019ve Googled all sorts of websites on diamonds and jewelry, and it\u2019s amazing what people will pay for a 10.5-carat D-color diamond mined in 1920.</p><p>\u201cHow big was the biggest stone in the necklace?\u201d I say yet again to Sadie. \u201cAbout.\u201d</p><p>Sadie sighs noisily. \u201cHalf an inch or so?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWas it very sparkly? Did it look flawless at all? That could affect its value.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re terribly interested in the value of my necklace all of a sudden.\u201d Sadie gives me a resentful look. \u201cI didn\u2019t think you were so mercenary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not mercenary!\u201d I say indignantly. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to work out why Uncle Bill was after it! He wouldn\u2019t waste his time unless it was valuable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat difference does it make if we can\u2019t lay our hands on it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe will lay our hands on it.\u201d</p><p>I have a plan, and it\u2019s a pretty good one. I\u2019ve been using all my detective skills in the few days since we got back from Uncle Bill\u2019s house. First of all, I found out about Diamant\u00e9\u2019s next Tutus and Pearls catwalk show. It\u2019s this Thursday at the Sanderstead Hotel, 6:30 p.m., private guest list. The only trouble was, I couldn\u2019t see Diamant\u00e9 putting me on the private guest list in a million years, bearing in mind I\u2019m not a photographer from Hello! or one of her celebrity chums or have four hundred quid to spend on a dress. So then came my master stroke. I emailed Sarah in a friendly way and said I\u2019d really like to support Diamant\u00e9 in her fashion venture and could I come and talk to Uncle Bill about it? Maybe I would just drop over to the house on spec, I suggested. Maybe tomorrow!!! And I added a few smiley faces for good measure.</p> <p>Sarah immediately emailed back that Bill was a little busy right now and I shouldn\u2019t come tomorrow, but she could talk to Diamant\u00e9\u2019s personal assistant. And the next thing I knew, two tickets were biked to my door. Honestly, it\u2019s so easy to get what you want from people if they think you\u2019re a psycho.</p><p>The only downer is that the second and crucial part of my plan-talk to Diamant\u00e9 and persuade her to give me the necklace straight after the show-has failed so far. Her assistant won\u2019t tell me where she is or give me her mobile phone number. She did allegedly pass on a message, but obviously I haven\u2019t heard anything. I mean, why would Diamant\u00e9 bother to call her nonentity of a nonmillionaire cousin?</p><p>Sadie\u2019s tried going to Diamant\u00e9\u2019s office in Soho, to see if she can catch her and the necklace-but apparently Diamant\u00e9 never sets foot there. It\u2019s staffed by assistants, and all the clothes are made by some company in Shoreditch. So that\u2019s no good.</p><p>There\u2019s only one thing for it. I\u2019m going to have to go along to the show, wait until it\u2019s over, then grab Diamant\u00e9 and somehow talk her there and then into giving the necklace to me.</p><p>Or, you know. Pinch it.</p><p>With a sigh, I close down the jewelry website and swivel around to survey Sadie. Today she\u2019s wearing a silver dress which apparently she desperately wanted when she was twenty-one, but her mother wouldn\u2019t buy it for her. She\u2019s sitting on the sill of the open window, her feet dangling above the street below. The dress is backless except for two thin silver straps over her slender shoulders, and there\u2019s a rosette at the small of her back. Of all the ghost dresses she\u2019s worn, this is my favorite.</p><p>\u201cThe necklace would look amazing with that dress,\u201d I say impulsively.</p><p>Sadie nods but doesn\u2019t say anything. There\u2019s a low-slung, dispirited cast to her shoulders, which isn\u2019t exactly surprising. We were so near to it. We saw it. And then we lost it.</p> <p>I watch her anxiously for a moment. I know Sadie hates \u201cdroning on about things.\u201d But maybe she\u2019d feel better if she talked. Just a little bit.</p><p>\u201cTell me again -why is the necklace so special to you?\u201d</p><p>For a while Sadie says nothing, and I wonder if she even heard the question. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI told you,\u201d she says at last. \u201cWhen I wore it, I felt beautiful. Like a goddess. Radiant.\u201d She leans against the window frame. \u201cYou must have something in your wardrobe that makes you feel like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr...\u201d I hesitate.</p><p>I can\u2019t honestly say I\u2019ve ever felt like a goddess. Or particularly radiant, come to that.</p><p>As if she can read my thoughts, Sadie turns and surveys my jeans dubiously. \u201cMaybe you don\u2019t. You should try wearing something beautiful for a change.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThese are nice jeans!\u201d I pat them defensively. \u201cMaybe they\u2019re not beautiful, exactly-\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re blue.\u201d She\u2019s regained her spirit by now and shoots me a scathing look. \u201cBlue! The ugliest color in the rainbow. I see the whole world, walking around with hideous blue legs. Why blue?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause...\u201d I shrug, nonplussed. \u201cDunno.\u201d</p><p>Kate has left the office early to go to the orthodondist, and all the phones are quiet. Maybe I\u2019ll leave too. It\u2019s nearly time, anyway. I glance at my watch and feel a shot of anticipation.</p><p>I adjust the pencil stuffed into my hair, stand up, and check over my outfit. Quirky printed T-shirt from Urban Outfitters. Cute little pendant of a frog. Jeans and ballet pumps. Not too much makeup. Perfect.</p> <p>\u201cSo... I thought we could go for a walk, maybe,\u201d I say super-casually to Sadie. \u201cIt\u2019s such a nice day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA walk?\u201d She peers at me. \u201cWhat kind of walk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust... a walk!\u201d Before she can say any more, I close down my computer, set the office answering machine, and grab my bag. Now that my plan is about to come to fruition, I\u2019m quite excited.</p><p>It only takes twenty minutes to get to Farringdon, and as I hurry up the tube steps I glance at my watch-5:45. Perfect.</p><p>\u201cWhat are we doing?\u201d Sadie\u2019s suspicious voice follows me. \u201cI thought you said we were going for a walk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are. Kind of.\u201d</p> <p>I half wish I\u2019d ditched Sadie. The trouble is, I think I might need her in reserve if things get tricky. I head to the corner of the main road and pause.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you waiting for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one,\u201d I say, a little too defensively. \u201cI\u2019m not waiting for anyone. I\u2019m just... hanging out. Watching the world go by.\u201d I lean casually against a pillar-box to prove my point, then hastily move away as a woman approaches to post a letter.</p><p>Sadie appears in front of me and scans my face, then suddenly inhales as she sees the book in my hand. \u201cI know what you\u2019re doing! You\u2019re trailing! You\u2019re waiting for Josh! Aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking control of my life.\u201d I avoid her eye. \u201cI\u2019m showing him I\u2019ve changed. When he sees me, he\u2019ll realize his mistake. You wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is a very bad idea. A very, very bad idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not. Shut up.\u201d I check my reflection and apply more lip gloss, then blot it off.</p><p>I\u2019m not going to listen to a word Sadie says. I\u2019m totally psyched and ready to go. I feel empowered. All those times I tried to get inside Josh\u2019s head, all those times I tried to ask him what he really wanted out of our relationship, he kept batting me away. But now, finally, I know what he wants! I know how to make things work!</p> <p>Ever since that lunch, I\u2019ve totally transformed myself. I\u2019ve kept the bathroom tidy. I\u2019ve stopped singing in the shower. I\u2019ve made a resolution never to mention anyone else\u2019s relationship, ever. I\u2019ve even looked at that William Eggleston photography book, but I think it would seem a bit of a coincidence to be actually holding it. Which is why I\u2019m clutching a book called Los Alamos , another collection by him. Josh is going to see me so differently. He\u2019s going to be amazed! Now I just have to bump into him accidentally-on-purpose as he leaves his office. Which is about two hundred yards away.</p><p>Keeping my eyes fixed on the entrance, I head toward a tiny alcove next to a shop where I have a good view of everybody as they head toward the tube station. A couple of Josh\u2019s colleagues hurry past, and I feel a clench of nerves in my stomach. He\u2019ll be here soon.</p><p>\u201cListen.\u201d I turn urgently to Sadie. \u201cYou might possibly have to help me out a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, help you?\u201d she says haughtily.</p><p>\u201cPrompt Josh a bit. Tell him he likes me. Just to make sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy will he need telling?\u201d she retorts. \u201cYou said he was going to realize his mistake when he saw you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe will,\u201d I say impatiently. \u201cBut he might not realize it straightaway . He might need... a nudge. A kick-start. Like old cars,\u201d I add in a moment of inspiration. \u201cLike in your times. Remember? You wound the handle round and round and then suddenly the engine caught and off it went. You must have done that millions of times.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTo motors,\u201d she says. \u201cNot men!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame thing!

Los Alamos?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d I say carelessly. \u201cI was looking through this fantastic book called Democratic Camera the other day. The pictures were so amazing, I just had to go and buy this.\u201d I pat it fondly, then look up. \u201cHey, didn\u2019t you quite like William Eggleston too?\u201d I wrinkle my brow innocently. \u201cOr was that someone else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love William Eggleston,\u201d says Josh slowly. \u201cIt was me who gave you Democratic Camera.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s right.\u201d I slap my head. \u201cI\u2019d forgotten.\u201d</p><p>I can see bewilderment in his face. He\u2019s on the back foot. Time to press home my advantage.</p> <p>\u201cJosh, I\u2019ve been meaning to say...\u201d I give him a rueful smile. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for all those texts I sent you. I don\u2019t know what got into me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...\u201d Josh coughs awkwardly.</p><p>\u201cWill you let me buy you a quick drink? Just to make it up? No hard feelings?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s silence. I can almost see his thought processes. It\u2019s a reasonable suggestion. It\u2019s a free drink. She looks sane enough .</p><p>\u201cOK.\u201d He puts his iPod away. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>I shoot a triumphant look at Sadie, who is shaking her head and making deathlike finger-across-the-throat gestures. Well, I don\u2019t care what she thinks. I march Josh into a nearby pub, order a white wine for me and a beer for him, and find a table in the corner. We raise our glasses and sip, and I open some crisps.</p><p>\u201cSo.\u201d I smile at Josh and offer him the packet.</p><p>\u201cSo.\u201d He clears his throat, obviously feeling awkward. \u201cHow are things?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJosh.\u201d I lean my elbows on the table and look at him seriously. \u201cYou know what? Let\u2019s not analyze everything. God, I\u2019m sick of people who analyze everything to death. I\u2019m sick of unpicking conversations. Just live. Enjoy life. Don\u2019t think about it!\u201d</p><p>Josh stares at me over his beer, looking totally confused. \u201cBut you used to love analyzing. You used to read that magazine Analyze .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve changed.\u201d I shrug simply. \u201cI\u2019ve changed in so many ways, Josh. I buy less makeup. My bathroom is totally empty. I was thinking I might like to travel. To Nepal maybe.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m sure I remember him mentioning Nepal, one of those times.</p><p>\u201cYou want to go traveling?\u201d He seems taken aback. \u201cBut you never said-\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt came to me recently,\u201d I say earnestly. \u201cWhy am I so unadventurous? There\u2019s so much out there to see. Mountains... cities... the temples of Kathmandu-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to see Kathmandu,\u201d he says, looking animated. \u201cYou know, I was thinking about going there next year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I beam at him. \u201cThat\u2019s amazing!\u201d</p><p>For the next ten minutes we talk about Nepal. At least, Josh talks about Nepal and I agree with everything he says, and the time just whizzes by. We both have color in our cheeks and are laughing as he glances at his watch. We look like a happy couple. I know, because I keep checking out our reflection in the mirror.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d better shoot,\u201d Josh suddenly says, looking at his watch. \u201cI\u2019ve got a squash practice. It\u2019s been good to see you, Lara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right,\u201d I say, taken aback. \u201cGreat to see you too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for the drink.\u201d I watch in slight panic as he picks up his laptop case. This isn\u2019t how it\u2019s supposed to go. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThis was a good idea, Lara.\u201d He smiles, then bends to kiss my cheek. \u201cNo hard feelings.

Same?\u201d He heads toward the bar. The minute he\u2019s out of earshot I hiss, \u201cSadie!\u201d and beckon her over from the bar stool where she\u2019s been sitting throughout, wedged between two businessmen with stripy-shirted guts.</p> <p>\u201cTell him he loves me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he doesn\u2019t love you,\u201d says Sadie, as though explaining something very simple to someone very stupid.</p><p>\u201cHe does! He does, really! He\u2019s just scared to admit it, even to himself. But you saw us. We were getting on amazingly. If he only had a little nudge in the right direction... please... please...\u201d I gaze at her entreatingly. \u201cAfter everything I\u2019ve done for you ... please .\u201d</p><p>Sadie gives an exasperated sigh. \u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>A microsecond later she\u2019s at Josh\u2019s side, bellowing in his ear, \u201cYou still love Lara! You made a mistake! You still love Lara!\u201d</p> <p>I can see him stiffen and shake his head, trying to rid himself of the noise. He brushes his ear a few times, breathes heavily, and rubs his face. At last I see him turn and survey me. He looks so dazed that if I wasn\u2019t feeling so anxious I\u2019d laugh.</p><p>\u201cYou still love Lara! You still love Lara!\u201d</p><p>As Josh carries the drinks over and sits down next to me, he seems transfixed. I shoot Sadie a grateful smile and sip my wine, waiting for Josh to declare himself. But he sits rigid, his eyes distant.</p><p>\u201cIs there something on your mind, Josh?\u201d I prompt at last in a soft voice. \u201cBecause if there is, you can tell me. I\u2019m an old friend. You can trust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLara-\u201d He stops.</p><p>I look desperately at Sadie for more help. He\u2019s nearly there, he\u2019s so nearly there...</p> <p>\u201cYou love Lara! Don\u2019t fight it, Josh! You love her!\u201d</p><p>Josh\u2019s brow is clearing. He\u2019s drawing breath. I think he\u2019s going to-</p><p>\u201cLara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Josh?\u201d I can hardly manage the words.</p><p>Go on, go on, go on...</p><p>\u201cI think maybe I made a mistake.\u201d Josh swallows hard. \u201cI think I still love you.\u201d</p><p>Even though I knew he was going to say it, there\u2019s a huge, romantic swell in my heart, and tears start pricking my eyes.</p><p>\u201cWell... I still love you, Josh,\u201d I say, my voice trembling. \u201cI always did.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m not sure if he kisses me or I kiss him, but suddenly our arms are wrapped around each other, and we\u2019re devouring each other. (OK, I think I kissed him.) As we draw apart eventually, Josh looks even more dazed than before.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d he says after a bit.</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d I lovingly mesh my fingers with his.</p><p>\u201cLara, I have this squash thing.\u201d He glances at his watch, looking uncomfortable. \u201cI need to...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d I say generously. \u201cGo. We can talk later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK.\u201d He nods. \u201cI\u2019ll text you my new number.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d I smile.</p><p>I won\u2019t bring up the fact that I think it was a total overreaction to change his mobile number just because of a few texts I sent him. We can talk about that another time. No hurry.</p><p>As he flips open his phone, I glance over his shoulder-and feel a jolt of sheer amazement. He\u2019s still got a photo of us on his screen. Him and me. Standing on a mountain in our skiwear at sunset. We\u2019re in silhouette, but I remember the moment vividly. We\u2019d been skiing all day, and the sunset was spectacular. We asked this German guy to take a picture, and he spent about half an hour lecturing Josh about the settings on his phone. And Josh kept the photo! All this time!</p><p>\u201cNice picture,\u201d I say in a deadpan, casual way, nodding at it.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Josh\u2019s face softens as he gazes at it. \u201cMakes me feel good whenever I look at it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d I say breathlessly.</p><p>I knew it. I knew it. He does love me. He just needed a nudge, he just needed a confidence boost, he just needed that inner voice to tell him it was OK.</p><p>My phone burbles with a text, and Josh\u2019s number pops up on my screen. I can\u2019t help a tiny sigh of satisfaction. I\u2019ve got him back again. He\u2019s mine!</p><p>We head out of the pub, hands tightly clasped, and pause at the corner.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get a cab,\u201d says Josh. \u201cDo you want to-\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m about to say, \u201cGreat! I\u2019ll share it with you!\u201d But then the new Lara stops me. Don\u2019t be too eager. Give him space . </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I shake my head. \u201cNo, thanks. I\u2019m going the other way. Love you.\u201d I kiss his fingers, one by one.</p><p>\u201cLove you.\u201d He nods. A cab stops, and Josh bends to kiss me again before getting in.</p><p>\u201cBye!\u201d I wave as it pulls off, then turn away, hugging myself, zinging all over with triumph. We\u2019re back together! I\u2019m back with Josh!</p><p>FOURTEEN</p> <p>I can never resist telling people good news. I mean, why not brighten someone else\u2019s life too? So by the following morning I\u2019ve texted all my friends that Josh and I are back together. And some of his friends, just because I happened to have their numbers programmed in my phone. And the guy at Dial-a-Pizza. (That was a mistake. He was pleased for me, though.)</p><p>\u201cOh my God, Lara!\u201d Kate\u2019s voice bursts through the office door at the same time as she does. \u201cYou made up with Josh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you got my text,\u201d I say nonchalantly. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s cool, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s amazing! I mean... it\u2019s incredible!\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t need to sound quite so surprised. But it\u2019s nice to have someone pleased for me. Sadie\u2019s such a downer on the whole thing. She hasn\u2019t said she\u2019s happy for me once, and every time I got a text back from one of my friends last night, she huffed. Even now she\u2019s gazing disapprovingly at me from her perch on top of the filing cabinet. But I don\u2019t care, because I\u2019ve got my most important phone call of all to make, and I am so looking forward to it. I dial the number, lean back, and wait for Dad to pick up. (Answering the phone makes Mum anxious, because it might be kidnappers. Don\u2019t ask.)</p> <p>\u201cMichael Lington.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, hi, Dad, it\u2019s Lara,\u201d I say in the casual tone I\u2019ve been practicing all morning. \u201cI just thought I\u2019d let you know that Josh and I are back together again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d says Dad after a pause.</p><p>\u201cYes, we bumped into each other yesterday,\u201d I say airily. \u201cAnd he said he still loved me and he\u2019d made a huge mistake.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s another silence at the other end of the phone. Dad must be too gobsmacked to answer.</p><p>Ha. This is such a sweet moment! I want to relish it forever. After all those weeks of people telling me I was sad and deluded and should move on. They were all wrong .</p> <p>\u201cSo it looks like I was right, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d I can\u2019t resist adding. \u201cI said we were meant to be together.\u201d I shoot Sadie a gloating look.</p><p>\u201cLara...\u201d Dad doesn\u2019t sound as happy as I thought he would. In fact, he sounds pretty stressed, bearing in mind his younger daughter has found happiness in the arms of the man she loves. \u201cAre you absolutely sure that you and Josh...\u201d He hesitates. \u201cAre you sure that\u2019s what he meant?\u201d</p><p>Honestly. Does he think I\u2019ve made it up or something?</p><p>\u201cYou can call him if you like! You can ask him! We bumped into each other, and we had a drink and talked about stuff, and he said he still loves me. And now we\u2019re back together. Just like you and Mum.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d I can hear Dad breathing out. \u201cThat\u2019s quite... incredible. Wonderful news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I can\u2019t help smiling complacently. \u201cIt just goes to show. Relationships are complicated things, and other people shouldn\u2019t barge in and think they know all about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed,\u201d he says faintly.</p><p>Poor Dad. I think I\u2019ve practically given him a heart attack.</p> <p>\u201cHey.\u201d I cast around for something to cheer him up. \u201cDad, I was thinking about our family history the other day. And I was wondering, have you got any pictures of Great-Aunt Sadie\u2019s house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, darling?\u201d Dad sounds like he\u2019s having trouble keeping up.</p><p>\u201cThe old family house that burned down. In Archbury. You showed me a photograph of it once. Have you still got it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so.\u201d Dad\u2019s voice is wary. \u201cLara, you seem a bit obsessed by Great-Aunt Sadie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not obsessed,\u201d I say resentfully. \u201cAll I\u2019m doing is showing a little interest in my heritage. I thought you\u2019d be pleased.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am pleased,\u201d says Dad quickly. \u201cOf course I am. I\u2019m just... surprised. You\u2019ve never been interested in family history before.\u201d</p><p>This is a fair point. He brought out some old photo album last Christmas and I fell asleep while he was showing it to me. (In my defense, I had eaten quite a few liqueur chocolates.)</p><p>\u201cYes, well... people change, don\u2019t they? And I\u2019m interested now. I mean, that photo\u2019s the only thing we\u2019ve got left of the house, isn\u2019t it?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNot quite the only thing,\u201d says Dad. \u201cYou know, the oak desk in the hall came from that house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn our hall?\u201d I stare at the phone in surprise. \u201cI thought everything was lost in the fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA very few things were salvaged.\u201d I can tell Dad\u2019s relaxed a little. \u201cThey were put in a storage unit and left there for years. Nobody could face dealing with it. It was Bill who sorted it all out, after your grandfather died. He was at a loose end. I was doing my accountancy exams. Strange to imagine, but Bill was the idler in those days.\u201d Dad laughs, and I can hear him take a sip of coffee. \u201cThat was the year your mother and I got married. That oak desk was our first piece of furniture. It\u2019s a wonderful piece of original art nouveau.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m riveted by this story. I\u2019ve walked past that desk about ten thousand times, but it\u2019s never once occurred to me to wonder where it came from. Maybe it was Sadie\u2019s own desk! Maybe it has all her secret papers in it! As I put the phone down, Kate is working industriously. I can\u2019t send her on yet another coffee run. But I\u2019m desperate to tell Sadie what I just heard.</p><p>Hey, Sadie! I type in a new document. Not everything was lost in the fire! There were some things in a storage unit! Guess what? We have a desk from your old house!</p><p>Maybe it has a hidden drawer full of all her lost treasures, I\u2019m thinking excitedly. And only Sadie knows how to open it. She\u2019ll tell me the secret code, and I\u2019ll gently tug it open and blow off the dust, and inside will be... something really cool. I gesticulate at her and point at my screen.</p><p>\u201cI know that desk was saved,\u201d says Sadie, after reading my message. She sounds deeply unimpressed by the news. \u201cI was sent a list of things at the time, in case I wanted to claim anything. Hideous crockery. Dull bits of pewter. Dreadful furniture. None of it interested me.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s not dreadful furniture , I type, a little indignantly. It\u2019s a wonderful piece of original art nouveau .</p> <p>I look up at Sadie, and she\u2019s sticking a finger down her throat. \u201cIt\u2019s minging,\u201d she says, and I can\u2019t help giggling.</p><p>Where did you learn that word? I type.</p><p>\u201cPicked it up.\u201d Sadie gives an insouciant shrug.</p><p>So I told my dad about Josh , I type, and look at Sadie for a reaction. But she rolls her eyes and disappears.</p><p>Fine. Be like that. I don\u2019t care what she thinks, anyway. I lean back, take out my mobile, and flip to one of Josh\u2019s texts. I feel all warm and content, as though I just drank a cup of hot chocolate. I\u2019m back with Josh, and all\u2019s right with the world.</p><p>Maybe I\u2019ll text Josh and tell him how pleased everyone is for us.</p> <p>No. I don\u2019t want to hound him. I\u2019ll leave it half an hour or so.</p><p>Across the room, the phone rings, and I wonder if maybe it\u2019s him. But a moment later Kate says, \u201cI\u2019ll put you on hold,\u201d and looks up anxiously. \u201cLara, it\u2019s Janet from Leonidas Sports. Shall I put her through?\u201d</p><p>All the hot chocolate drains out of my stomach.</p><p>\u201cYes. OK, I\u2019ll speak to her. Just give me thirty seconds.\u201d I psych myself up, then lift the phone with my breeziest top-recruitment-consultant manner. \u201cHi, Janet! How are you? Did you get the short list all right?\u201d</p><p>Kate emailed the short list to Janet last night. I should have known she\u2019d call. I should have gone out for the day or pretended to have lost my voice.</p><p>\u201cI hope you\u2019re as excited by it as I am,\u201d I add brightly.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not,\u201d Janet says in her usual hoarse, peremptory tones. \u201cLara, I don\u2019t understand. Why\u2019s Clive Hoxton on the list?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, Clive,\u201d I say, trying to sound confident. \u201cWhat a man. What a talent.\u201d</p> <p>OK, so here\u2019s the thing. I know my lunch with Clive didn\u2019t end brilliantly. But the truth is, he\u2019d be perfect for the job. And I might be able to talk him around before the interview. So I put him on the list anyway, with provisional after his name in small letters.</p><p>\u201cClive\u2019s a really bright executive, Janet.\u201d I launch into my spiel. \u201cHe\u2019s experienced in marketing, very dynamic, ripe for a move-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know all that.\u201d Janet cuts me off. \u201cBut I bumped into him at a reception last night. He said he\u2019d made it clear he wasn\u2019t interested. In fact, he was shocked to learn he was on the short list.\u201d</p><p>Fuck .</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I summon tones of astonishment. \u201cHow... strange. How very strange. That\u2019s not the impression I got at all.

In fact, I\u2019d say this candidate is definitely your person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, who is it?\u201d says Janet suspiciously. \u201cWhy don\u2019t I have the details?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause... I need to firm things up first.\u201d I\u2019m crossing my fingers so hard they hurt. \u201cIt\u2019s all very confidential. This is a high-profile person we\u2019re talking about, Janet. Very senior, very experienced-believe me, I\u2019m excited.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need a name!\u201d she barks angrily. \u201cI need a r\u00e9sum\u00e9! Lara, this is all highly unprofessional. Our in-house meeting is on Thursday. Can I speak to Natalie, please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I say in panic. \u201cI mean... Thursday. Absolutely! You\u2019ll have all the information on Thursday. I promise. And all I can say is, you\u2019ll be bowled over by the caliber of this particular candidate. Janet, I must dash, great to talk.\u201d I put the phone down, my heart thumping.</p><p>Shit. Shit . What am I going to do now?</p><p>\u201cWow!\u201d Kate looks up, eyes shining. \u201cLara, you\u2019re such a star. I knew you\u2019d do it! Who\u2019s this amazing high-profile candidate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t one!\u201d I say desperately. \u201cWe have to find one!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRight.\u201d Kate starts looking urgently around the office, as though a top-level marketing executive might be hiding in the filing cabinet. \u201cEr... where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d I thrust my fingers through my hair. \u201cThere aren\u2019t any!\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a shrill electronic burble as my phone receives a text, and I grab it, hoping for one mad moment that it\u2019s a top marketing executive asking me if I have any jobs in sports retail going. Or maybe Josh, asking me to marry him. Or maybe Dad, saying he now realizes I was right all along and would like to apologize for ever having doubted me. Or even Diamant\u00e9, saying she doesn\u2019t need that old dragonfly necklace after all, should she send it around by courier?</p><p>But it\u2019s none of them. It\u2019s Natalie.</p><p>Hi babe! Am doing some yoga on the beach. It\u2019s so mellow here. Have sent u a pic, look at the view. Awesome, huh? Nataliexxxx PS Everything OK in the office?</p><p>I feel like hurling it out of the window.</p><p>By seven o\u2019clock my neck is aching and my eyes are red-rimmed. I\u2019ve made a new, emergency long list of candidates, using old issues of Business People , the Internet, and a copy of Marketing Week I made Kate run out and buy. But none of them will even take my call-let alone talk about a job, let alone allow me to quickly slap them onto a short list. I have less than forty-eight hours. I\u2019m going to have to invent a top marketing director. Or impersonate one.</p><p>On the plus side, they had a half-price offer on pinot grigio at Oddbins.</p><p>The minute I get home, I turn on the TV and start glugging down the wine at speed. By the time EastEnders starts, I\u2019ve got through half a bottle, the room is swinging from side to side, and my work troubles are receding nicely.</p><p>After all. I mean. All that really matters is love, isn\u2019t it?</p><p>You have to get things in perspective. In proportion. Love is the thing. Not work. Not marketing directors. Not scary conversations with Janet Grady. I just need to cling on to that and I\u2019ll be OK. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019m cradling my phone in my lap, and every so often I turn on my texts to read them again. I\u2019ve been texting Josh all day, just to keep my spirits up. And he\u2019s sent two texts back! Quite short ones, but even so. He\u2019s at some dreary work conference in Milton Keynes and he said he can\u2019t wait to be back home.</p><p>Which obviously means he can\u2019t wait to see me!</p><p>I\u2019m debating whether to send him another light, friendly text, asking him what he\u2019s doing, when I glance up and notice Sadie sitting on the fireplace in a pale gray chiffony dress.</p><p>\u201cOh, hi,\u201d I say. \u201cWhere did you get to?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAt the cinema. I watched two films.\u201d She shoots me an accusing look. \u201cYou know, it gets very lonely during the day. You\u2019re so preoccupied with your work.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d be preoccupied if she had Janet Grady on her tail.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m very sorry I have to earn a living,\u201d I reply, a little sarcastically. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I\u2019m not a lady of leisure and can\u2019t watch movies all day-\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you got the necklace yet?\u201d she says, right over me. \u201cHave you done anything more about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Sadie,\u201d I say tetchily. \u201cI haven\u2019t. I\u2019ve had a few other problems today, as it happens.\u201d I wait for her to ask what those problems are, but she just gives a distant shrug. Isn\u2019t she even going to ask me what happened? Isn\u2019t she going to offer me any sympathy? Some guardian angel she is.</p> <p>\u201cJosh has been texting me; isn\u2019t that great?\u201d I add, to annoy her.</p><p>She gives me a baleful look. \u201cIt\u2019s not great. The whole thing is absolutely false.\u201d</p><p>She glares at me and I glare back. Obviously, neither of us is in a brilliant mood tonight.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not false. It\u2019s real. You saw him kiss me; you heard what he said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a puppet,\u201d says Sadie dismissively. \u201cHe said whatever I told him to say. I could have told him to make love to a tree and he would have done. I\u2019ve never known anyone so weak-willed! I barely had to whisper at him and he jumped.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s so arrogant. Who does she think she is, God?</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s rubbish,\u201d I say coldly. \u201cOK, I know you nudged him a bit. But he would never say he loved me unless there was a basis of truth. He was obviously expressing what he really feels, deep down.\u201d</p><p>Sadie gives a sarcastic laugh. \u201c\u2018What he really feels deep down.\u2019 Darling, you\u2019re too amusing. He doesn\u2019t have any feelings for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe does!\u201d I spit. \u201cOf course he does! He had my picture on his phone, didn\u2019t he? He\u2019d been carrying it around all this time! That\u2019s love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not love. Don\u2019t be ridiculous.\u201d Sadie seems so sure of herself, I feel a swell of absolute fury.</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019ve never even been in love! So what would you know about it? Josh is a real man, with real feelings and real love, something you know nothing about. And you can think what you like, but I really believe I can make things work, I really believe Josh has deep feelings for me-\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not enough to believe!\u201d Sadie\u2019s voice is suddenly passionate, almost savage. \u201cDon\u2019t you see that, you stupid girl? You could spend your whole life hoping and believing! If a love affair is one-sided, then it\u2019s only ever a question, never an answer. You can\u2019t live your life waiting for an answer.\u201d</p><p>She flushes and swivels away.</p><p>There\u2019s a sharp silence, except for two EastEnders laying into each other on-screen. My mouth has dropped open in astonishment, and I notice I\u2019m about to tip wine all over the sofa. I right my hand and take a gulp. Bloody hell. What was that outburst all about?</p> <p>I thought Sadie didn\u2019t care about love. I thought she only cared about having fun and tally-ho and the sizzle. But just then she sounded as if...</p><p>\u201cIs that what happened to you, Sadie?\u201d I say tentatively to her back. \u201cDid you spend your whole life waiting for an answer?\u201d</p><p>Instantly, she disappears. No warning, no \u201csee you later.\u201d She just vanishes.</p><p>She can\u2019t do this to me. I have to know more. There\u2019s got to be a story here. I switch off the TV and call loudly into thin air. All my annoyance has evaporated; I\u2019m consumed by curiosity instead.</p><p>\u201cSadie! Tell me! It\u2019s good to talk about things!\u201d The room is silent, but somehow I\u2019m sure she\u2019s still there. \u201cCome on,\u201d I say, wheedling. \u201cI\u2019ve told you everything about me. And I\u2019m your great-niece. You can trust me. I won\u2019t tell anyone.\u201d</p><p>Still nothing.</p><p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d I shrug. \u201cThought you had more guts than that.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI do have guts.\u201d Sadie appears in front of me, looking furious.</p><p>\u201cSo tell me.\u201d I fold my arms.</p><p>Sadie\u2019s face is motionless, but I can see her eyes flickering to me and away again.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to tell,\u201d she says finally, her voice low. \u201cIt\u2019s simply that I do know what it\u2019s like to think you\u2019re in love. I know what it\u2019s like to squander all your hours and all your tears and all your heart on something which turns out to be... nothing. Don\u2019t waste your life. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p> <p>That\u2019s all? Is she kidding? She can\u2019t leave it there! There was a something. What was the something?</p><p>\u201cWhat happened? Did you have a love affair? Was there some guy when you were living abroad? Sadie, tell me!\u201d</p><p>For a moment Sadie looks as though she\u2019s still not going to answer, or else disappear again. Then she sighs, turns away, and walks toward the mantelpiece.</p><p>\u201cIt was a long time ago. Before I went abroad. Before I was married. There was... a man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe big row with your parents!\u201d I suddenly put two and two together. \u201cWas that because of him?\u201d</p> <p>Sadie tilts her head forward about a millimeter in assent. I should have known it was a man. I try to picture her with a boyfriend. Some dapper twenties guy in a boater, maybe. With one of those old-fashioned mustaches.</p><p>\u201cDid your parents catch you together or something? Were you... barney-mugging?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d She bursts into laughter.</p><p>\u201cSo what happened? Tell me! Please!\u201d</p><p>I still can\u2019t quite get over the fact that Sadie\u2019s been in love. After giving me such a hard time about Josh. After pretending she didn\u2019t care about anything.</p><p>\u201cThey found sketches.\u201d Her laughter dies away and she hugs her skinny chest. \u201cHe was a painter. He liked to paint me. My parents were scandalized.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with him painting you?\u201d I say, puzzled. \u201cThey should have been pleased! I mean, it\u2019s a compliment, an artist wanting to-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaked?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m gobsmacked. And kind of impressed. I would never pose naked for a painting. Not in a million years! Not unless the painter could do some kind of airbrushing.</p><p>Brushing, maybe. Whatever artists do.</p><p>\u201cI had a drape over me. But, even so, my parents...\u201d Sadie presses her lips together. \u201cThat was a dramatic day, the day they found the sketches.\u201d</p><p>My hand is clapped over my mouth. I know I shouldn\u2019t laugh, I know it\u2019s not really funny, but I can\u2019t help it.</p><p>\u201cSo they saw you-your-\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey became absolutely hysterical.\u201d She gives a tiny snort, almost a laugh. \u201cIt was funny-but it was dreadful too. His parents were as angry as mine. He was supposed to be going into law.\u201d She shakes her head. \u201cHe would never have made a lawyer. He was a great big shambles of a man. He painted all night, and drank wine, and smoked gaspers back to back, stubbed them out on his palette... We both did. I used to spend all night with him at his studio. In his parents\u2019 shed. I used to call him Vincent, after van Gogh. He called me Mabel.\u201d She gives another tiny snort.</p><p>\u201cMabel?\u201d I wrinkle my nose.</p><p>\u201cThere was a maid at his house called Mabel. I told him I thought it was the ugliest name I\u2019d ever heard and they should make her change it. So he instantly started calling me Mabel. Cruel beast that he was.\u201d</p><p>Her tone is half jokey, but there\u2019s a strange flickering in her eyes. I can\u2019t tell if she wants to remember all this or not.</p><p>\u201cDid you...\u201d I begin-then chicken out before I can finish the question. I wanted to ask, \u201cDid you really love him?\u201d But Sadie\u2019s lost in her own thoughts, anyway.</p><p>\u201cI used to creep out of the house when everyone was asleep, climb down the ivy...\u201d She trails away, her eyes distant. Suddenly she looks really sad. \u201cWhen we were discovered, everything changed. He was sent to France, to some uncle, to \u2018get it all out of his system.\u2019 As if anyone could ever stop him painting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was his name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis name was Stephen Nettleton.\u201d Sadie breathes out heavily. \u201cI haven\u2019t said that name aloud for... seventy years. At least.\u201d</p><p>Seventy years?</p><p>\u201cSo what happened? After that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were never in touch with each other, ever again,\u201d says Sadie matter-of-factly.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d I say in horror. \u201cDidn\u2019t you write to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I wrote.\u201d She gives a brittle smile that makes me wince. \u201cI sent letter after letter to France. But I never heard from him. My parents said I was a nave little simpleton. They said he\u2019d used me for what he could get. I wouldn\u2019t believe them at first, hated them for saying it. But then...\u201d She looks up, her chin set, as though defying me to pity her. \u201cI was like you. \u2018He does love me, he really does!\u2019\u201d She puts on a mocking, high-pitched voice. \u201c\u2018He\u2019ll write! He\u2019ll come back for me. He loves me!\u2019 Do you know how it felt when I finally came to my senses?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There\u2019s a taut silence.</p><p>\u201cSo... what did you do?\u201d I hardly dare speak.</p><p>\u201cGot married, of course.\u201d I can see the flash of defiance. \u201cStephen\u2019s father conducted the service. He was our vicar. Stephen must have known, but he didn\u2019t even send a card.\u201d</p><p>She lapses into silence, and I sit there, my thoughts teeming. She got married to Waistcoat Guy out of revenge. It\u2019s obvious. It\u2019s awful. No wonder it didn\u2019t last.</p> <p>I\u2019m totally deflated. I wish I hadn\u2019t pressed Sadie so hard now. I didn\u2019t want to stir up all these painful memories. I just thought she\u2019d have some fun, juicy anecdote and I could find out what sex was like in the 1920s.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you ever think about following Stephen to France?\u201d I can\u2019t help asking.</p><p>\u201cI had my pride.\u201d She gives me a pointed look, and I feel like retorting, \u201cWell, at least I got my guy back!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you keep any of the sketches?\u201d I\u2019m desperately casting around for an upside.</p><p>\u201cI hid them.\u201d She nods. \u201cThere was a big painting too. He smuggled it to me, just before he left for France, and I hid it in the cellar. My parents had no idea. But then, of course, the house was burned and I lost it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh God.\u201d I sag in disappointment. \u201cWhat a shame.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. I didn\u2019t care. Why should I care?\u201d</p><p>I watch her for a minute pleating her skirt, over and over, obsessively, her eyes busy with memories.</p><p>\u201cMaybe he never got your letters,\u201d I say hopefully.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m sure he did.\u201d There\u2019s an edge to her voice. \u201cI know they went into the post. I had to smuggle them out of the house and into the postbox myself.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t bear this. Smuggling letters, for God\u2019s sake. Why didn\u2019t they have mobile phones in the 1920s? Think how many misunderstandings in the world could have been avoided. Archduke Ferdinand could have texted his people -I think a weirdo\u2019s following me- and he wouldn\u2019t have got assassinated. World War I wouldn\u2019t have happened. And Sadie could have called her man; they could have talked it through...</p> <p>\u201cIs he still alive now?\u201d I\u2019m gripped by irrational hope. \u201cWe could track him down! We could Google him, we could go to France, I bet we\u2019d find him-\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe died young.\u201d Sadie cuts me off, her voice remote. \u201cTwelve years after he left England. They brought home his remains and had a funeral in the village. I was living abroad by then. I wasn\u2019t invited, anyway. And I wouldn\u2019t have gone.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m so horrified, I can\u2019t reply. Not only did he leave her, he died . This is a rubbish story with a terrible ending, and I wish I\u2019d never asked.</p><p>Sadie\u2019s face is drawn as she gazes out of the window. Her skin seems paler than ever, and there are shadows under her eyes. In her silver-gray dress she looks like a vulnerable little wisp. I feel tears spring to my eyes. She loved this artist. It\u2019s obvious. Underneath all the bravado and the back chat, she really loved him. All her life, probably.</p><p>How could he not have loved her back? Bastard. If he were alive now I\u2019d go and find him and beat him up. Even if he was some quavery million-year-old man with twenty grandchildren. \u201cIt\u2019s so sad.\u201d I rub my nose. \u201cIt\u2019s just so sad.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not sad,\u201d she retorts at once, her old flippant air returning. \u201cIt\u2019s the way things are. There are other men, there are other countries, there are other lives to live. But that\u2019s why I know.\u201d She suddenly rounds on me. \u201cI know, and you have to believe me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnow what?\u201d I\u2019m not following her at all. \u201cBelieve what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll never work things out with your chap. Your Josh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I glare back at her defensively. Trust her to bring Josh into it.</p> <p>\u201cBecause you can want and want and want.\u201d She turns away, hugging her knees. I can see the bony line of her spine through her dress. \u201cBut if he doesn\u2019t want you back... you might as well wish the sky were red.\u201d</p><p>FIFTEEN</p><p>I\u2019m not panicking. Even though it\u2019s Wednesday and I still don\u2019t have a solution and Janet Grady is on the warpath.</p><p>I\u2019m kind of beyond panic. I\u2019m in an altered state. Like a yogi.</p><p>I\u2019ve been dodging calls from Janet all day. Kate\u2019s told her I\u2019m in the loo, at lunch, trapped in the loo, and then at last I heard her saying desperately, \u201cI can\u2019t disturb her, I really can\u2019t disturb her...

Maybe it was just desperation. Tonya! She\u2019s tough and hard and ironlike and all those scary qualities.

It\u2019s stimulating for both children and parents, and I\u2019ve met some other great mums there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re telling me you\u2019d rather do Suzuki music and drink cappuccinos than be a top marketing director.\u201d I tried to inject an incredulous note, even though I would a million times rather be doing Suzuki music and drinking cappuccinos right now than dealing with all this.</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said flatly. \u201cI would. Why are you approaching me, anyway, Lara?\u201d Suddenly her voice was more alert. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Have you got a problem? Because you can always talk to me about it, you know, if things are going wrong...\u201d</p><p>Oh God. Not the fake-o sympathy.</p><p>\u201cNothing\u2019s going wrong! Just trying to do my big sister a favor.\u201d I left it a moment or two before adding casually, \u201cSo, those mums you\u2019ve met at Suzuki music. None of them used to be a top marketing director, did they?\u201d</p><p>You\u2019d think out of eight formerly professional mothers there\u2019d have been one marketing director with retail experience who wanted to return to work at once. You\u2019d think.</p><p>Anyway. So much for that bright idea. In fact, so much for all my ideas. The only possibility I\u2019ve found is a guy in Birmingham who might move if Leonidas Sports pays for his helicopter commute every week. Which is never going to happen in a million years. I\u2019m doomed. All in all, you\u2019d think now would not be the best time to be glammed up and going to a party.</p><p>Nevertheless, here I am in a taxi, glammed up and going to a party.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re here! Park Lane!\u201d Sadie peers out of the window. \u201cPay the driver! Let\u2019s go!\u201d</p><p>Bright flashes from cameras are filling our taxi, and I can hear the hubbub of people greeting one another. I see a group of about ten people in evening dress arriving on the red carpet leading up to the Spencer Hotel, where the Business People dinner is taking place. According to the Financial Times , four hundred of the top business talents in London are going to be gathered here tonight.</p><p>As one of those talents, I was all set to cancel, for many, many reasons:</p><p>1. I\u2019m back with Josh now and shouldn\u2019t be attending dinners with other men.</p><p>2. I\u2019m too stressed out by work.</p><p>3. I mean, really stressed out.</p><p>4. Janet Grady might be here and yell at me.</p><p>5. Clive Hoxton, ditto. Not to mention:</p> <p>6. Have to talk to Mr. American Frown all night.</p><p>But then it hit me. Four hundred businesspeople, all together in one room. Some of them have got to be top-level marketing executives. And some of them have got to want a new job. Surely.</p><p>So this is my last-ditch plan. I\u2019m going to find a candidate for Leonidas Sports tonight, at the dinner.</p><p>I double-check that my evening bag is well stocked with business cards and glance at my reflection in the window. Needless to say, Sadie took charge of my outfit again. I\u2019m in a black sequined vintage dress with fringed sleeves and beaded Egyptian-style medallions at the shoulders. Over this I\u2019m wearing a cloak. My eyes are heavily kohled, I have a long gold snake bracelet, and even a pair of original stockings, just like Sadie used to wear, apparently. And on my head is a close-fitting diamant\u00e9 mesh cap, which Sadie found at some antique market.</p><p>Tonight I feel a lot more confident, though. For a start, everyone else will be dressed up too. And even though I protested about the cap, I secretly think I look quite cool. I look kind of glam and retro.</p><p>Sadie\u2019s dolled up too, in a fringed dress, all turquoise and green, with a peacock feather shawl. She\u2019s wearing about ten necklaces, and on her head is the most ludicrous headdress, with a diamant\u00e9 waterfall cascading past her ear. She keeps flipping her evening bag open and shut and seems in a manic mood. In fact, she\u2019s been manic ever since she told me that story about her old dead lover. I\u2019ve tried to ask her more about it, but no dice. She just glides away or vanishes or changes the subject. So I\u2019ve given up. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d Her legs are twitching. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to start dancing!\u201d</p><p>For God\u2019s sake. She\u2019s obsessed. And if she thinks I\u2019m dancing with Ed in the middle of the bar for a second time, she needs to think again.</p><p>\u201cSadie, listen,\u201d I say firmly. \u201cIt\u2019s a business dinner. There won\u2019t be any dancing. I\u2019m here to work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll find some,\u201d she says confidently. \u201cYou can always find dancing.\u201d</p> <p>Yeah. Whatever.</p><p>As I get out, people in evening dress are everywhere, shaking hands confidently and laughing and posing for the cameras. Several of them I recognize from Business People photo spreads. For a moment I feel all twingey with nerves. But then I glance at Sadie and raise my chin, just like she does. So what if they\u2019re important? I\u2019m as good as they are. I\u2019m a partner in my own company. Even if it consists of two people and a dodgy coffee machine.</p><p>\u201cHi. Lara.\u201d Ed\u2019s voice greets me from behind, and I turn. There he is, looking as square-cut and handsome as I might have expected. His dinner jacket fits him perfectly; his dark hair is brushed back perfectly.</p><p>Josh never wears a standard DJ. He always wears something offbeat, like a Nehru jacket over jeans. But then, Josh is really cool.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d I take Ed\u2019s hand before he gets any idea of kissing me. Not that I think he would. He\u2019s looking my outfit up and down with a quizzical expression.</p> <p>\u201cYou look very... twenties.\u201d</p><p>Well spotted, Einstein . \u201cYes, well.\u201d I shrug. \u201cI like twenties clothes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo kidding,\u201d he says, deadpan.</p><p>\u201cYou look delicious!\u201d says Sadie joyfully to Ed. She flings herself at him, wraps both arms around his chest, and nuzzles his neck.</p><p>Urgh. Is she going to do that all night?</p><p>We\u2019re approaching a small group of photographers, and at a signal from a lady with an earpiece, Ed stops with a slight roll of his eyes. \u201cSorry. I have to do this, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShit!\u201d I say in panic as the camera flashes blind me. \u201cWhat do I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStand a little side-on,\u201d he murmurs reassuringly. \u201cChin up and smile. Don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s natural to freak out. I did media training for this stuff. The first time, I was so stiff I looked like a Thunderbird puppet.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help smiling. Actually, he does look a bit like a Thunderbird, with his square jaw and dark brows.</p><p>\u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking,\u201d he says, as the flashes keep coming. \u201cI look like a Thunderbird anyway. It\u2019s OK. I can take the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking that!\u201d I say unconvincingly. We move on to another group of photographers. \u201cHow come you know about Thunderbirds , anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding? I saw it when I was a kid. I was obsessed. I wanted to be Scott Tracy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to be Lady Penelope.\u201d I glance up at him. \u201cSo you\u2019re interested in one piece of British culture, at least.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not sure if a children\u2019s TV show counts as \u201cculture,\u201d but I can\u2019t resist making my point. Ed looks surprised and draws breath as though to answer-but before he can, the earpiece lady comes to escort us onward, and the moment\u2019s gone.</p> <p>As we head into the hotel, I\u2019m looking around, trying to suss out all the people, trying to see if there\u2019s anyone I could approach about the Leonidas Sports job. I have to circulate quickly, before everyone sits down to eat.</p><p>Meanwhile, Sadie has been glued to Ed\u2019s side, stroking his hair and rubbing her face against his and running her hand over his chest. As we come to a halt in front of a reception table, she suddenly dips down and pokes her head into his dinner jacket pocket. I\u2019m so disconcerted, I jump.</p><p>\u201cSadie!\u201d I mutter furiously behind Ed\u2019s back. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaving a look at his things!\u201d she says, standing up. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t anything very interesting, just some papers and a pack of cards. I wonder what\u2019s in his trouser pockets... hmm...\u201d Her eyes focus on his crotch, and a gleam appears.</p><p>\u201cSadie!\u201d I hiss in horror. \u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Harrison!\u201d A woman in a chic navy cocktail dress has swooped down on Ed. \u201cI\u2019m Sonia Taylor, head of PR at Dewhurst Publishing. We\u2019re so looking forward to your speech.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPleased to be here.\u201d Ed nods. \u201cMay I introduce Lara Lington, my...\u201d He looks at me dubiously, as though searching for the word. \u201cDate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, Lara.\u201d Sonia turns to me with a warm smile. \u201cWhat line are you in?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Oh wow.

Really, really fine...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d Sonia gives me a slightly strange look. \u201cI\u2019ll just find your name badges.\u201d</p><p>Sadie\u2019s head reappears briefly, then plunges back in again. What\u2019s she doing in there?</p><p>\u201cLara, is something wrong?\u201d Ed turns to me with a puzzled frown.</p><p>\u201cUm... no!\u201d I manage. \u201cIt\u2019s all good, all good...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGoodness!\u201d Sadie\u2019s head suddenly reappears. \u201cI got a good view there.\u201d</p><p>I clap a hand over my mouth. Ed eyes me suspiciously.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I manage. \u201cJust... coughing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere we are!\u201d Sonia turns back from the table and hands us each a badge. \u201cEd, can I steal you for a moment to run through the order of events?\u201d She smiles stiffly, then leads Ed away.</p><p>At once, I pull out my phone as camouflage, then wheel around to Sadie.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do that again! You put me off! I didn\u2019t know where to look!\u201d</p> <p>Sadie raises her eyebrows wickedly. \u201cJust wanted to satisfy my curiosity.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not even going to ask what that means.</p><p>\u201cWell, don\u2019t! That woman Sonia thinks I\u2019m a complete flake now. She didn\u2019t even take my business card.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what?\u201d Sadie gives an insouciant shrug. \u201cWho cares what she thinks?\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s as if a switch flips inside me. Doesn\u2019t she realize how desperate I am? Hasn\u2019t she noticed me and Kate working thirteen-hour days?</p><p>\u201cI care!\u201d I round on her furiously and she shrinks back. \u201cSadie, why d\u2019you think I\u2019m here? I\u2019m trying to build up my business! I\u2019m trying to meet important people!\u201d I gesture around at the milling hall. \u201cI\u2019ve got to find a candidate for Leonidas Sports by tomorrow! If I don\u2019t do something soon, we\u2019ll go bust. We practically are bust. I\u2019ve been totally stressed out and you don\u2019t even care. You haven\u2019t even noticed.\u201d My voice is suddenly shaking a bit, which must be because of all the double-shot lattes I\u2019ve drunk today. \u201cAnyway. Whatever. Do what you like. Just stay away from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLara-\u201d Sadie starts to speak, but I stride away from her toward the double doors to the main banqueting room. Ed and Sonia are on the podium, and I can see her explaining the microphone to him. Around me, tables are filling up with dynamic-looking men and women. I can hear snatches of conversation about markets and retail sectors and TV campaigns.</p><p>This is my big chance. Come on, Lara . Plucking up all my courage, I take a glass of champagne from a passing waiter, then approach a group of business types, all laughing merrily away about something.</p> <p>\u201cHi!\u201d I plunge in brightly. \u201cI\u2019m Lara Lington, L &amp;N Executive Recruitment. Let me give you my card!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d says a friendly-looking man with red hair. He makes introductions around the group, and I hand cards to everyone. From their name badges, it seems they all work for software companies.</p><p>\u201cSo, does anyone here work in marketing?\u201d I ask casually. All eyes turn to a blond-haired man.</p><p>\u201cGuilty.\u201d He smiles.</p><p>\u201cWould you like a new job?\u201d I blurt out. \u201cIt\u2019s at a sports-equipment company-great benefits, a really fab opportunity!\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s silence. I can\u2019t breathe for hope. Then everyone bursts into laughter.</p><p>\u201cI like your style,\u201d says the red-haired guy, and turns to his neighbor. \u201cCan I interest you in an Asian software subsidiary, only ten years on the clock?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne careful owner,\u201d quips another guy, and there\u2019s more laughter.</p><p>They think I\u2019m joking. Of course they do.</p><p>I hastily join in the laughter too. But inside, I feel like a total moron. I\u2019m never going to find a candidate. This was a ridiculous idea. After a little while I excuse myself and move away, to find Ed approaching me across the floor.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s it going? Sorry to abandon you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo worries. I was... you know. Networking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re at table one.\u201d He leads me toward the stage and I feel a flicker of pride, in spite of my low mood.

The truth is, there is no sane reason.</p><p>\u201cFriends?\u201d I suggest at last.</p><p>\u201cFriends,\u201d he echoes doubtfully. \u201cI guess we could be friends.\u201d</p> <p>He pulls out my chair and I sit down. By every place is a program with Guest Speaker: Ed Harrison written across the bottom.</p><p>\u201cAre you nervous?\u201d</p><p>Ed\u2019s eyes flicker, then he gives me a tiny smile. \u201cIf I were I wouldn\u2019t say.\u201d</p><p>I flick to the back of the program and feel a little kick when I find my own name in the list. Lara Lington, L &amp;N Executive Recruitment .</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t strike me as a typical headhunter,\u201d says Ed, following my gaze.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I\u2019m not quite sure how to react. Is that a good thing or a bad thing?</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t seem obsessed with money, for a start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to make more money,\u201d I say honestly. \u201cLots more. But I suppose that isn\u2019t the main point for me. I\u2019ve always seen headhunting as a bit like-\u201d I break off, embarrassed, and take a sip of wine.</p><p>I once told my headhunting theory to Natalie, and she said I was crazy and to shut up about it.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell. Like matchmaking. Matching the perfect person with the perfect job.\u201d</p><p>Ed looks amused. \u201cThat\u2019s a different way of looking at it. I\u2019m not sure most people around here would say they were having a love affair with their jobs.\u201d He gestures around the crowded room.</p><p>\u201cMaybe they would if it was the right job, though,\u201d I say eagerly. \u201cIf you could just match people up with exactly what they want...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019d be Cupid.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re laughing at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d He shakes his head firmly. \u201cI like it as a theory. How does it work in practice?\u201d</p><p>I sigh. There\u2019s something about Ed that makes me lower my guard. Maybe it\u2019s because I honestly don\u2019t care what he thinks of me.</p><p>\u201cNot great. In fact, right now, pretty shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat bad, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven worse.\u201d I take another drink of my wine, then look up to see Ed watching me quizzically.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in a partnership, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo... how did you decide who to go into partnership with?\u201d he says lightly. \u201cHow did that all happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNatalie?\u201d I shrug. \u201cBecause she\u2019s my best friend and I\u2019ve known her forever and she\u2019s a very talented top headhunter. She used to work for Price Bedford Associates, you know. They\u2019re huge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He seems to think for a moment. \u201cOut of interest, who told you she was a very talented top headhunter?\u201d</p><p>I stare at him, feeling slightly wrong-footed. \u201cNo one had to tell me. She just is . I mean...\u201d I meet his skeptical gaze. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s none of my business. But when you and I first...\u201d Again he hesitates, as though searching for the word. \u201cMet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I nod impatiently.</p><p>\u201cI did a little asking around. Nobody had even heard of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d I take a slug of champagne. \u201cThere you go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I have a contact at Price Bedford, and he told me a little about Natalie. Interesting.\u201d</p><p>I feel a sudden foreboding at his expression. \u201cOh, really?\u201d I say defensively. \u201cBecause I bet they were pissed off to lose her. So whatever he said-\u201d</p><p>Ed lifts his hands. \u201cI don\u2019t want to get into this. It\u2019s your partnership, your friend, your choices.\u201d</p><p>OK. Now I have a bad feeling.</p><p>\u201cTell me.\u201d I put my glass down, all my bravado gone. \u201cPlease, Ed. Tell me. What did he say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d Ed shrugs. \u201cThe story went that she lured a number of high-profile people onto a list for some anonymous \u2018blue-chip job\u2019 that didn\u2019t exist. Then she tried to offer them up to some less-than-blue-chip client and claim this was the job she\u2019d meant all along. The shit hit the fan, big-time. The senior partner at her firm had to step in, calm things down. That\u2019s why she was fired.\u201d Ed hesitates. \u201cBut you knew this, right?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I stare at him, speechless.

She painted such an amazing picture and dropped so many big names, I was bowled over. I quit my job the next week and took out all my savings. I\u2019m such a gullible ... idiot . I feel tears trembling on the brink of my lashes and quickly take a gulp of champagne.</p><p>\u201cLara?\u201d Sadie\u2019s shrill voice comes in my ear. \u201cLara, come quick! I need to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>I really don\u2019t feel like talking to Sadie. But nor can I keep sitting here with Ed looking at me with so much concern. I think he\u2019s guessed this is all a total shock to me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back in a second!\u201d I say overbrightly, and push my chair back. I head across the crowded room, trying to ignore Sadie, who\u2019s pursuing me, jabbering in my ear.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m very sorry,\u201d she\u2019s saying. \u201cI thought about it and you\u2019re right, I was selfish and thoughtless. So I decided to help you, and I have! I\u2019ve found you a candidate! A wonderful, perfect candidate!\u201d Her words interrupt my painful, circular thought pattern.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I turn. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou may think I\u2019m not interested in your work, but I am,\u201d she announces. \u201cYou need a trophy, and I\u2019ve found you one. Aren\u2019t I clever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been listening in on everyone\u2019s conversations!\u201d she says proudly. \u201cI was starting to think it was hopeless, but then I heard a woman called Clare whispering to her friend in a corner. She\u2019s not happy. It\u2019s the power games, you know.\u201d Sadie opens her eyes at me impressively. \u201cThings are getting so bad at her place, she\u2019s thinking of quitting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. So the point is-\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s a head of marketing, of course!\u201d Sadie says triumphantly. \u201cIt was on her badge. I knew that\u2019s what you wanted, a head of marketing. She won an award last month, you know. But her new \u2018chief exec\u2019 didn\u2019t even congratulate her. He\u2019s a total pig,\u201d she adds confidingly. \u201cThat\u2019s why she wants to leave.\u201d</p><p>I swallow several times, trying to stay calm. A marketing head who wants to move jobs. An award-winning marketing head who wants to move jobs. Oh God. I would die and go to heaven.</p><p>\u201cSadie... is this for real?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course! She\u2019s over there!\u201d Sadie gestures at the other side of the room.</p><p>\u201cIs she into sports? Exercise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrawny calves,\u201d says Sadie. \u201cI noticed them at once.\u201d</p><p>I hurry to a nearby board and look through the list of guests. Clare... Clare...</p><p>\u201cClare Fortescue, marketing director of Shepherd Homes?\u201d I feel a jab of excitement. \u201cShe was on my new long list! I wanted to talk to her, but I couldn\u2019t get through!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, she\u2019s here! Come on, I\u2019ll show her to you!\u201d</p><p>My heart is thumping as I cross the crowded room, searching all the faces for someone looking like a Clare.</p><p>\u201cThere!\u201d Sadie is pointing at a woman with glasses in a royal blue dress. She has cropped dark hair, a mole on her nose, and is on the short side. I probably wouldn\u2019t even have spotted her if Sadie hadn\u2019t pointed her out to me.</p><p>\u201cHi!\u201d I walk up to her and take a deep breath. \u201cClare Fortescue?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d she says briskly.</p><p>\u201cMay I have a quick word?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell... OK.\u201d Looking a bit puzzled, Clare Fortescue allows me to draw her away from the group she\u2019s in.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d I give her a nervous smile. \u201cMy name\u2019s Lara, and I\u2019m a recruitment consultant. I\u2019ve been meaning to make contact with you. Your reputation has spread, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d She looks suspicious. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOf course!

It\u2019s a really exciting sportswear company with massive potential, and I think you\u2019d be perfect. You\u2019d be my number-one pick.\u201d I pause, then add lightly, \u201cBut, of course, you may be very happy where you are right now...\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s silence. I can\u2019t tell what\u2019s going on behind Clare Fortescue\u2019s glasses. My whole body is so tense, I can\u2019t even breathe.</p> <p>\u201cActually... I have been thinking about a move,\u201d she says at last, so quietly I can barely hear. \u201cI might very well be interested. But it would have to be the right situation.\u201d She gives me a bulletlike look. \u201cI\u2019m not compromising myself. I have standards.\u201d</p><p>Somehow I manage not to whoop. She\u2019s interested and she\u2019s tough!</p><p>\u201cGreat!\u201d I smile. \u201cMaybe I can call you in the morning. Or if you had a few minutes to spare right now?\u201d I try not to sound desperate. \u201cWe could have a chat? Just quickly?\u201d</p><p>Please... please... please please please...</p><p>Ten minutes later I walk back to the table, giddy with joy. She\u2019s going to send me her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 tomorrow. She used to play right wing in hockey! She\u2019s a perfect match!</p> <p>Sadie seems even more thrilled than I am as we head back to the table.</p><p>\u201cI knew it!\u201d she keeps saying. \u201cI knew she\u2019d be right!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a star,\u201d I say joyfully. \u201cWe\u2019re a team. High-five!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHigh what?\u201d Sadie looks perplexed.</p><p>\u201cHigh-five! Don\u2019t you know what a high-five is? Hold up your hand...\u201d</p><p>OK. It turns out high-fiving a ghost is a mistake. That woman in red thought I was trying to hit her. Hastily, I resume walking. I arrive at the table and beam at Ed. \u201cI\u2019m back!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo you are.\u201d He gives me a quizzical look. \u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrilliantly, since you ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrilliantly!\u201d echoes Sadie, and jumps into his lap. I reach for my champagne glass. Suddenly I\u2019m in the mood for a party.</p><p>SIXTEEN</p><p>Tonight is turning out to be one of the best evenings of my life. The dinner is delicious. Ed\u2019s speech goes down fantastically. Afterward, people keep coming over to congratulate him, and he introduces me to everyone. I\u2019ve given out all my business cards and set up two meetings for next week, and Clare Fortescue\u2019s friend has just come over to ask discreetly if there\u2019s anything I can do for her .</p><p>I\u2019m euphoric. Finally I feel like I\u2019m getting myself on the map!</p><p>The only slight pain is Sadie, who\u2019s got bored by business talk and has started on about dancing again. She\u2019s been out exploring, and according to her there\u2019s some tiny nightclub down the street which is perfect and we have to go there immediately.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I mutter, as she pesters me yet again. \u201cShh! The magician\u2019s doing another trick!\u201d</p> <p>As we all sip our coffee, a magician is doing the rounds of the tables. He\u2019s just pushed a bottle of wine through the table, which was quite amazing. Now he\u2019s asking Ed to choose a shape on a card and saying he\u2019ll mind read it.</p><p>\u201cOK,\u201d says Ed, choosing a card. I glance over his shoulder, and it shows a squiggle shape. It was between the squiggle, a square, a triangle, a circle, or a flower.</p><p>\u201cFocus on the shape and nothing else.\u201d The magician, who is wearing a jeweled jacket, fake tan, and eyeliner, fixes his gaze firmly on Ed. \u201cLet The Great Firenzo use his mysterious powers and read your mind.\u201d</p><p>The magician\u2019s name is The Great Firenzo. He\u2019s mentioned this fact about ninety-five times; plus, all his props have The Great Firenzo written on them in big swirly red writing.</p><p>There\u2019s a hush around the table. The Great Firenzo takes both hands up to his head, as though in a trance.</p><p>\u201cI am communing with your mind,\u201d he says, his voice low and mysterious. \u201cThe message is coming in. You have chosen... this shape!\u201d With a flourish, he produces a card which exactly matches Ed\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cCorrect.\u201d Ed nods and shows his card to the table.</p><p>\u201cAmazing!\u201d gasps a blond woman opposite.</p><p>\u201cPretty impressive.\u201d Ed is turning his own card over, examining it. \u201cThere\u2019s no way he could have seen what I picked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the power of the mind,\u201d intones the magician, swiftly collecting the card from Ed. \u201cIt\u2019s the power of... The Great Firenzo!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDo it to me!\u201d begs the blond woman excitedly. \u201cRead my mind!\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d The Great Firenzo turns to face her. \u201cBut beware. When you open your mind to me, I can read all your secrets. Every deepest, darkest one.\u201d His eyes flash and she giggles.</p><p>She totally fancies The Great Firenzo, it\u2019s obvious. She\u2019s probably beaming her deepest, darkest secrets at him right now.</p><p>\u201cI find the ladies\u2019 minds are often easier to ... penetrate.\u201d The Great Firenzo raises an eyebrow suggestively. \u201cThey are weaker, softer... but more delightful within.\u201d He grins toothily at the blond woman, who gives an embarrassed laugh.</p> <p>Ugh. He\u2019s revolting. I glance at Ed, who has an expression of distaste on his face.</p><p>We all watch as the blond woman picks a card, studies it for a moment, then says decidedly, \u201cI\u2019ve chosen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the triangle,\u201d says Sadie, with interest. She\u2019s bobbing behind the back of the blond woman, looking down at the card. \u201cI thought she\u2019d choose the flower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelax.\u201d The Great Firenzo is focusing intently on the blond woman. \u201cYears of study in the East have made me attuned to the thought waves of the human mind. Only The Great Firenzo can penetrate the brain to such a degree. Do not resist, sweet lady. Let Firenzo probe your thoughts. I promise...\u201d He gives the toothy smile again. \u201cI\u2019ll be gentle.\u201d</p><p>Eeuuww. He thinks he\u2019s so hot, but he\u2019s a total sleazeball. and sexist.</p> <p>\u201cOnly The Great Firenzo has such powers,\u201d he says dramatically, looking around the table at us all. \u201cOnly The Great Firenzo can achieve such a feat. Only The Great Firenzo can-\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I can too,\u201d I say brightly. I\u2019ll show him who\u2019s got a weaker mind.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d The Great Firenzo shoots me a look of dislike.</p><p>\u201cI can commune with the mind too. I know what card she chose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, young lady.\u201d The Great Firenzo gives me a savage smile. \u201cDo not interrupt the work of The Great Firenzo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just saying.\u201d I shrug. \u201cI know what it is.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t,\u201d says the blond woman, a little aggressively. \u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. You\u2019re spoiling it for everyone. Has she had too much to drink?\u201d She turns to Ed.</p><p>What a nerve.</p><p>\u201cI do know!\u201d I say indignantly. \u201cI\u2019ll draw it if you like. Does anyone have a pen?\u201d A nearby man holds out a pen, and I start drawing on my napkin.</p><p>\u201cLara,\u201d says Ed in a low voice. \u201cWhat exactly are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMagic,\u201d I say confidently. I finish my triangle and thrust the napkin at the blond woman. \u201cIs that right?\u201d</p><p>The blond woman\u2019s jaw drops. She looks incredulously at me, then down at the napkin again.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s right.\u201d She turns her card over and there\u2019s a gasp around the table. \u201cHow did you do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you, I can do magic. I, too, have mysterious powers granted to me from the East. They call me The Great Lara.\u201d I catch Sadie\u2019s eye and she smirks.</p> <p>\u201cAre you a member of the Magic Circle?\u201d The Great Firenzo looks livid. \u201cBecause our protocol states-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not in any circle,\u201d I say in a pleasant tone. \u201cBut my mind\u2019s pretty strong, I think you\u2019ll find. For a lady.\u201d</p><p>The Great Firenzo looks totally put out and starts gathering his props.</p><p>I glance over at Ed, who raises his dark eyebrows. \u201cVery impressive. How d\u2019you do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMagic.\u201d I shrug innocently. \u201cI told you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Great Lara, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. That\u2019s what my disciples call me. But you can call me Greatie for short.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreatie.\u201d His mouth is twitching, and I see a smile pop out at one corner. A real, genuine smile.</p><p>\u201cOh my God!\u201d I point at him in triumph. \u201cYou smiled! Mr. American Frown actually smiled!\u201d</p><p>Oops. Maybe I have had too much to drink. I didn\u2019t mean to call him Mr. American Frown out loud. For an instant Ed looks a bit taken aback-then he shrugs, as deadpan as ever.</p><p>\u201cMust have been a mistake. I\u2019ll speak to someone about it. Won\u2019t happen again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, good. Because you could do your face an injury, just smiling like that.\u201d</p><p>Ed doesn\u2019t reply, and for a moment I wonder whether I\u2019ve gone too far. He does seem quite sweet. I don\u2019t want to offend him.</p><p>Suddenly I hear a pompous-looking guy in a white tuxedo holding forth to his friend. \u201cIt\u2019s simply a balance of probabilities, nothing more. Any one of us could work out the likelihood of picking the triangle, with a bit of practice-\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo, you couldn\u2019t!\u201d I interrupt him indignantly. \u201cOK, I\u2019ll do another trick.

I\u2019ll read your mind and tell you what you wrote.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d The man gives a little raised-eyebrows smile around the table, as though to say, \u201cI\u2019ll indulge her,\u201d and takes a pen out of his pocket. \u201cI\u2019ll use my napkin.\u201d</p><p>He lowers his napkin onto his lap so it\u2019s completely out of view.

A shape, you say. Hmm... What shape could it be? Circle... square... I\u2019m getting a square...\u201d</p><p>The pompous man is exchanging smug smiles with the guy next to him.

Show the table your napkin, please.\u201d</p><p>Ha! The pompous man looks like he swallowed a fish. Slowly, he holds up the napkin, and there\u2019s a massive gasp, followed by applause.</p><p>\u201cFucking hell,\u201d says his neighbor bluntly. \u201cHow did you do that?\u201d He appeals to the table. \u201cThere\u2019s no way she could have known that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a trick,\u201d the pompous man is saying, but he\u2019s sounding less convinced.</p><p>\u201cDo it again!

Female powers,\u201d I can\u2019t help adding. \u201cWhich means they\u2019re especially strong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d he snaps. \u201cForget it.

The Great Firenzo has packed up and gone. I feel a bit bad about him, but then, he shouldn\u2019t have been so obnoxious, should he?</p><p>Several tables have been pushed aside, chairs have been dragged forward, and an audience has assembled. By now I\u2019ve refined my act so that I go off into a little side room, and the person writes down whatever it is and shows the whole audience. Then I come back in and guess. So far I\u2019ve had names, dates, Bible verses, and a drawing of Homer Simpson. (Sadie described it to me. Luckily I got it.)</p><p>\u201cAnd now.\u201d I look impressively around the little crowd. \u201cThe Great Lara will perform a yet more astounding feat.

You\u2019re on your own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSa-\u201d I stop dead as she disappears before my eyes. \u201cSadie, don\u2019t joke.\u201d I wheel around, but there\u2019s no answer or sight of her. \u201cOK, very funny. Come back.\u201d</p> <p>Great. She\u2019s in a huff.</p><p>\u201cSadie.\u201d I adopt a humbler tone. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I can understand you\u2019re annoyed. Please come back and let\u2019s talk about it.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s no response. The little room is dead. I look around, feeling a bit more alarmed.</p><p>She can\u2019t have gone.</p><p>I mean, she can\u2019t have just left me.</p><p>I jump as there\u2019s a knock at the door and Ed comes in. Ed\u2019s turned into my unofficial assistant. He\u2019s been marshaling the requests and handing out pens and paper.</p> <p>\u201cFive minds at once, huh?\u201d he says as he enters.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I hastily plaster on a smile. \u201cEr... yes! Why not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s quite a crowd out there. All the people who were in the bar have come in to watch. Standing room only.\u201d He gestures at the door. \u201cReady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Instinctively I back away. \u201cI mean, I might take a moment first. I need to get my head straight. Have a breather.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not surprised. Must take a lot of concentration.\u201d Ed leans against the door frame and surveys me for a moment. \u201cI\u2019ve been watching you as hard as I can, but I still can\u2019t figure it out. However you do it... it\u2019s awesome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Er... thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee you out there.\u201d The door closes behind Ed, and I wheel around.</p><p>\u201cSadie,\u201d I call desperately. \u201cSadie! Sadie!\u201d</p> <p>OK. I\u2019m in trouble.</p><p>The door opens and I give a small squeak of fright. Ed looks in again, a bit puzzled.</p><p>\u201cI forgot-do you want a drink from the bar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I smile weakly. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything OK?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! Of course. I\u2019m just... focusing my powers. Getting into the zone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d He nods understandingly. \u201cI\u2019ll leave you be.\u201d The door closes again.</p><p>Fuck. What am I going to do? In a minute they\u2019ll start demanding I come out. They\u2019ll expect me to mind read. They\u2019ll expect me to do magic. My chest is tight with fear.</p><p>There\u2019s only one option: I have to escape. I look desperately around the little room, which is obviously used to store spare banquet furniture. No window. There\u2019s a fire escape door in the far corner, but it\u2019s blocked by a massive stack of gold chairs about ten feet high. I try to pull the chairs aside, but they\u2019re too heavy. Fine. I\u2019ll climb over them.</p><p>Determinedly, I put one foot on a chair and haul myself up. Then another. The gold lacquer is a bit slippery, but I\u2019m managing. It\u2019s like a ladder. A wonky, rickety ladder.</p><p>The only trouble is, the higher I get, the more the chairs are swaying. By the time I\u2019m about eight feet up, the stack of chairs is teetering at quite a scary angle. It\u2019s like the Leaning Tower of Gold Chairs, with me crouching in terror near the top.</p><p>If I took just one more huge step, I\u2019d be over the summit and I could quickly scramble down the other side to the fire exit. But every time I move my foot, the stack wobbles so much I withdraw it in fright. I try shifting to the side-but the stack lurches even more. I clutch another chair desperately, not daring to look down. The whole thing feels like it\u2019s going to fall, and the ground seems a really long way away.</p><p>I take a deep breath. I can\u2019t stay here frozen forever. There\u2019s nothing for it. I have to be brave and go over the top. I take a massive step up, placing my foot on a chair about three from the top. But as I shift my weight, the stack leans back so far I can\u2019t help screaming.</p><p>\u201cLara!\u201d The door bursts open and Ed appears. \u201cWhat the hell-\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeeelp!\u201d The whole stack of chairs is collapsing. I knew I should never have moved- </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJesus Christ!\u201d Ed rushes forward as I tumble down.

Ed grabs my hand and helps me to my feet, then rubs his chest with a wince. I think I kicked it by mistake on the way down.</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d He stares at me incredulously. \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d</p><p>I shoot an agonized glance at the door to the banquet room.

But I can\u2019t do it anymore.\u201d</p><p>Ed surveys me silently for a few seconds, his eyes flickering as they meet mine. He looks deadly grave, as if some massive worldwide company is facing collapse and he\u2019s working out a master plan to save it.</p><p>At the same time, he quite looks like he wants to laugh.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying your mysterious Eastern mind-reading powers have deserted you,\u201d he says at last.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say in a small voice.</p> <p>\u201cAny idea why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I scuff my toe, not wanting to look at him.</p><p>\u201cWell. Just go out there and tell everybody.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t!\u201d I wail in horror. \u201cEveryone will think I\u2019m a flake. I\u2019ve been The Great Lara. I can\u2019t just go and say, \u2018Sorry, I can\u2019t do it anymore.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure you can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I shake my head firmly. \u201cNo way. I have to go. I have to escape.\u201d</p><p>I start heading toward the fire exit again, but Ed grabs my arm.</p><p>\u201cNo escaping,\u201d he says firmly. \u201cNo running away. Turn the situation around. You can do it. C\u2019mon.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut how?\u201d I say hopelessly.</p><p>\u201cPlay with them. Make it an entertainment. So you can\u2019t read their thoughts-you can make them laugh. And then we leave, right away, and you\u2019re still The Great Lara in everyone\u2019s mind.\u201d His gaze bores firmly into mine. \u201cIf you run away now, you really will be The Great Flake.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s right. I don\u2019t want him to be right, but he is.</p><p>\u201cOK,\u201d I say at last. \u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cD\u2019you need some more time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019ve had enough time. I just want to get it over with. And then we go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we go. Deal.\u201d A tiny grin pops through again. \u201cGood luck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d That\u2019s two smiles , I want to add. (But don\u2019t.)</p><p>Ed strides through the door and I follow him, somehow managing to hold my head high. There\u2019s a buzz of chatter, which dies down as I appear, and turns to a roar of applause. I can hear wolf whistles from the back, and someone\u2019s even videoing me on their phone. I\u2019ve been out so long, they obviously think I\u2019ve been building up to some amazing finale.</p><p>The five victims are sitting on chairs, each holding a piece of paper and a pen. I smile at them, then look at the crowd.</p><p>\u201cLadies and gentlemen, forgive my leave of absence. I have been opening my mind to a number of thought waves tonight. And quite frankly... I\u2019m shocked at what I\u2019ve discovered. Shocked! You.\u201d I wheel around to the first girl, who\u2019s holding her piece of paper close to her chest. \u201cObviously I know what you\u2019ve drawn.\u201d I make a brushing-aside gesture, as though what she\u2019s drawn is neither here nor there. \u201cBut far more interesting is the fact that there\u2019s a man in your office who you think is rather delicious. Don\u2019t deny it!\u201d</p><p>The girl flushes, and her reply is drowned by a roar of laughter. \u201cIt\u2019s Blakey!\u201d someone yells, and there\u2019s more laughter.</p><p>\u201cYou, sir!\u201d I turn to a cropped-haired guy. \u201cThey say most men think about sex once every thirty seconds, but with you it\u2019s far, far more frequent than that.\u201d There are gales of laughter, and I hastily turn to the next man. \u201cWhereas you, sir, think about money every thirty seconds.\u201d</p><p>The man bursts into laughter. \u201cShe is a bloody mind reader!\u201d he calls out.</p><p>\u201cYour thoughts were unfortunately too steeped in alcohol for me to make out.\u201d I smile kindly at the portly guy sitting on the fourth chair. \u201cAnd as for you...\u201d I pause as I face the girl on the fifth chair. \u201cI suggest you never, ever tell your mother what you were just thinking.\u201d I raise my eyebrows teasingly, but she doesn\u2019t rise. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She frowns. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>Shit.</p><p>\u201cYou know.\u201d I force myself to hold my smile steady. \u201cYou know...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She shakes her head stolidly. \u201cI\u2019ve got no idea what you\u2019re on about.\u201d</p> <p>The audience\u2019s chatter has died away. Faces are turned to us with interest.</p><p>\u201cDo I have to spell it out?\u201d My smile is becoming forced. \u201cThose... thoughts? Those particular thoughts you were just having...\u201d I\u2019m nearing the end of my rope here. \u201cJust now...\u201d</p><p>Suddenly her face snaps in horror. \u201cOh God. That. You\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>Somehow I manage not to expire with relief.</p><p>\u201cThe Great Lara is always right!\u201d I make an elaborate bow. \u201cFarewell, and see you all again.\u201d</p> <p>I head quickly through the applauding audience toward Ed.</p><p>\u201cI got your bag,\u201d he murmurs above the clapping. \u201cOne more bow, then we\u2019re out.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t breathe until we\u2019re safely out on the street. The air is clear and there\u2019s a warmish breeze. The hotel doorman is surrounded by groups of people waiting for taxis, but I don\u2019t want to risk anyone from the dinner catching up with me, so I hastily walk down onto the pavement.</p><p>\u201cWell done, Greatie,\u201d says Ed as we fall into step.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShame about the magic powers.\u201d He\u2019s looking at me inquiringly, but I pretend not to notice.</p> <p>\u201cYes, well.\u201d I shrug casually. \u201cThey come, they go, that\u2019s the mystery of the East. Now, if we walk this way\u201d-I squint at a street sign-\u201cwe should be able to pick up a taxi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in your hands,\u201d says Ed. \u201cI don\u2019t know this area.\u201d</p><p>This not-knowing-London is really starting to annoy me.</p><p>\u201cIs there any area you do know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know my route to work.\u201d Ed shrugs. \u201cI know the park opposite my building. I know the way to Whole Foods.\u201d</p><p>OK, I\u2019ve had it. How dare he come to this great city and show zero interest in it?</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think that\u2019s really narrow-minded and arrogant?\u201d I stop dead. \u201cDon\u2019t you think if you come and live in a city you should respect it enough to get to know it? London is one of the most fascinating, historic, amazing cities in the world! And bloody Whole Foods! That\u2019s an American shop! Couldn\u2019t you try Waitrose?\u201d My voice rises. \u201cI mean, why did you take a job here if you weren\u2019t interested in the place? What were you planning to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was planning to explore it with my fianc\u00e9e,\u201d Ed says calmly.</p> <p>His answer slightly takes the wind out of my sails.</p><p>Fianc\u00e9e. What fianc\u00e9e?</p><p>\u201cUntil she broke up with me, a week before we were supposed to come,\u201d Ed continues conversationally. \u201cShe asked her company to transfer her London placement to someone else. So, you see, I had a dilemma. Come to England, stay focused, and do the best I could, or stay in Boston, knowing I\u2019d see her almost every day. She worked in the same building as me.\u201d He pauses a second before adding, \u201cAnd her lover.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I stare at him in dismay. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I... didn\u2019t realize.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d</p><p>His face is so impassive, it almost seems like he doesn\u2019t care-but I\u2019m getting to understand his deadpan style. He does care, of course he does. Suddenly his frown is making more sense. And that closed-up expression. And that weary voice he had in the restaurant. God, what a bitch his fianc\u00e9e must be. I can see her now. Big white American teeth and swingy hair and killer heels. I bet he bought her a massive ring. I bet she\u2019s kept it.</p><p>\u201cThat must have been horrible,\u201d I say feebly as we start walking again.</p><p>\u201cI had the guidebooks.\u201d He\u2019s gazing resolutely ahead. \u201cI had the itineraries. I had a million projects planned. Stratford-upon-Avon... Scotland... Oxford... But they were all planned with Corinne. Kind of takes the fun out of it.\u201d</p><p>A vision comes to me of a pile of guidebooks, all scribbled and annotated with their exciting plans. And then shut away. I feel so sorry for him, I think I should probably shut up now and stop giving him a hard time. But some stronger instinct makes me push on.</p><p>\u201cSo you just go your route to work and back again every day,\u201d I say. \u201cYou never look left or right. You go to Whole Foods and the park and back again and that\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorks for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long have you been over here again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive months?\u201d I echo in horror. \u201cNo. You can\u2019t exist like that. You can\u2019t lead your life in tunnel vision. You have to open your eyes and look around. You have to move on.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMove on,\u201d he echoes, in mock-amazed tones. \u201cWow. Right. Not a phrase anyone\u2019s said to me much.\u201d</p><p>OK, so obviously I\u2019m not the only one who\u2019s given him a pep talk. Well, too bad.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be gone in two more months,\u201d he adds curtly. \u201cIt hardly matters whether I get to know London or not-\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, what, you\u2019re just treading water, just existing, waiting until you feel better? Well, you never will! Not unless you do something about it!\u201d All my frustration with him pours out in a stream. \u201cLook at you, doing memos for other people, and emails for your mum, and solving everyone else\u2019s problems because you don\u2019t want to think about your own! Sorry, I overheard you in Pret A Manger,\u201d I add sheepishly as Ed\u2019s head jerks up. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to live in a place, doesn\u2019t matter how long, you need to engage with it. Otherwise you\u2019re not really living. You\u2019re just functioning. I bet you haven\u2019t even unpacked properly, have you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAs it happens... \u201d He pauses for a few steps. \u201cMy housekeeper unpacked for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere you go.\u201d I shrug, and we walk on a little more in silence, our footsteps almost in time. \u201cPeople break up,\u201d I say at last. \u201cIt\u2019s just the way things are. And you can\u2019t dwell on what might have been. You have to look at what is.\u201d</p><p>As I\u2019m saying the words, I have a weird flash of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. I think Dad said something to me like this once about Josh. In fact, he might even have used those exact words.</p><p>But that was different. I mean, obviously it\u2019s an entirely different scenario. Josh and I weren\u2019t planning a trip, were we? Or to move cities. And now we\u2019re back together again. Totally different.</p><p>\u201cLife is like an escalator,\u201d I add wisely.</p> <p>When Dad says that to me, I get all annoyed because he just doesn\u2019t understand. But somehow it\u2019s different when I\u2019m giving advice.</p><p>\u201cAn escalator,\u201d echoes Ed. \u201cThought it was a box of chocolates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, definitely an escalator. You see, it carries you on regardless.\u201d I mime an escalator. \u201cAnd you might as well enjoy the view and seize every opportunity while you\u2019re passing. Otherwise it\u2019ll be too late. That\u2019s what my dad told me when I broke up with this... this guy.\u201d</p><p>Ed walks on a few paces. \u201cAnd did you take his advice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr... well...\u201d I brush my hair back, avoiding his eye. \u201cKind of.\u201d</p><p>Ed stops and looks at me gravely. \u201cDid you \u2018move on\u2019? Did you find it easy? Because I sure as hell haven\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>I clear my throat, playing for time. What I did isn\u2019t really the point here, surely?</p><p>\u201cYou know, there are lots of definitions of \u2018move on.\u2019\u201d I try to maintain my wise tone. \u201cMany different variations. Everyone has to move on in their own way.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not sure I want to get into this conversation, actually. Maybe now is the moment to find a cab.</p><p>\u201cTaxi!\u201d I wave my hand at a passing cab, but it sails past, even though its light is on. I hate when they do that.</p><p>\u201cLet me.\u201d Ed approaches the curb, and I take out my mobile phone. There\u2019s a pretty good minicab company that I use. Maybe they could come and pick us up. I retreat into a doorway, dial the number, and wait on hold, before I eventually discover that all the cabs are out tonight and it\u2019ll be a half-hour wait.</p><p>\u201cNo good.\u201d I come out of the doorway to see Ed standing stock still on the pavement. He\u2019s not even trying to hail a cab. \u201cNo luck?\u201d I say in surprise.</p><p>\u201cLara.\u201d He turns to me. His face is confused and his eyes are a little glassy. Has he been taking drugs or something? \u201cI think we should go dancing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I peer at him, perplexed.</p> <p>\u201cI think we should go dancing.\u201d He nods. \u201cIt would be a perfect way to round off the evening. It just came to me out of the blue.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t believe it. Sadie .</p><p>I whirl around on the pavement, searching the darkness, and suddenly spot her, floating by a lamppost.</p><p>\u201cYou!\u201d I exclaim furiously, but Ed doesn\u2019t even seem to notice.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a nightclub near here,\u201d he\u2019s saying. \u201cCome on. Let\u2019s have a quick dance. It\u2019s a great idea. I should have thought of it before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know there\u2019s a nightclub here?\u201d I retort. \u201cYou don\u2019t know London!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, right.\u201d He nods, looking a bit flummoxed himself. \u201cBut I\u2019m pretty sure there\u2019s a nightclub down that street.\u201d He gestures. \u201cDown there, third left. We should go check it out.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019d love to,\u201d I say sweetly. \u201cBut I must just make a call.

I\u2019m so angry with her, I almost don\u2019t know where to start.</p><p>\u201cHow could you just leave me like that?\u201d I spit in an undertone. \u201cI was completely lost!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you weren\u2019t! You did very well. I was watching.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou were there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI felt rather bad,\u201d says Sadie, looking distantly over my shoulder. \u201cI came back to see if you were all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, thanks a lot,\u201d I say sarcastically. \u201cYou really helped. And now what\u2019s all this?\u201d I gesture at Ed.</p><p>\u201cI want to dance!\u201d she says with defiance. \u201cI had to take extreme measures.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat have you done to him? He looks shell-shocked!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI made some... threats,\u201d she says evasively.</p><p>\u201cThreats?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that!\u201d She suddenly rounds on me. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t need to if you weren\u2019t so selfish. I know your career\u2019s important, but I want to go dancing! Proper dancing! You know I do. That\u2019s why we\u2019re here. It\u2019s supposed to be my evening. But you take over and I don\u2019t get a look in! It\u2019s not fair!\u201d</p><p>She sounds almost tearful. And suddenly I feel bad. It was supposed to be her evening, and I did kind of hijack it.</p><p>\u201cOK. You\u2019re right. Come on, let\u2019s go dancing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWonderful! We\u2019ll have such a good time. This way...\u201d Her spirits restored, Sadie directs me through some tiny Mayfair streets I\u2019ve never been down before. \u201cNearly there... Here!\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s a tiny place called the Flashlight Dance Club. I\u2019ve never heard of it. Two bouncers are standing outside, looking half asleep, and they let us in, no question.</p><p>We descend a set of dim wooden steps and find ourselves in a large room carpeted in red, with chandeliers, a dance floor, a bar, and two guys in leather trousers sitting morosely at the bar. A DJ on a tiny stage is playing some JLo track. No one\u2019s dancing.</p><p>Is this the best Sadie could find?</p><p>\u201cListen, Sadie,\u201d I mutter as Ed goes up to the neon-lit bar. \u201cThere are better clubs than this. If you really want to dance, we should go somewhere a bit more happening-\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d A voice interrupts me. I turn to see a slim, high-cheeked woman in her fifties, wearing a black top and gauze skirt over leggings. Her faded red hair is up in a knot, her eyeliner is crooked, and she looks anxious. \u201cAre you here for the Charleston lesson?\u201d</p><p>Charleston lesson?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d the woman continues. \u201cI suddenly remembered we had an arrangement.\u201d She stifles a yawn. \u201cLara, is it? You\u2019re certainly wearing the right clothes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me.\u201d I smile, haul out my phone, and turn to Sadie.</p> <p>\u201cWhat have you done?\u201d I mutter. \u201cWho\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need lessons,\u201d Sadie says unrepentantly. \u201cThis is the teacher. She lives in a little room upstairs. Normally the lessons are during the day.\u201d</p><p>I stare at Sadie incredulously. \u201cDid you wake her up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI must have forgotten to put the appointment in my diary,\u201d the woman is saying as I turn back. \u201cIt\u2019s not like me-thank goodness I remembered! Out of the blue, it came to me that you would be waiting here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d I shoot daggers at Sadie. \u201cAmazing, the powers of the human brain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s your drink.\u201d Ed arrives by my side. \u201cWho\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m your dance instructor, Gaynor.\u201d She holds out her hand and Ed takes it, looking bewildered. \u201cHave you always been interested in the Charleston?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Charleston?\u201d Ed looks mystified.</p><p>I feel a bit hysterical. The truth is, Sadie always gets her way. She wants us to dance the Charleston. We\u2019re going to dance the Charleston. I owe it to her. And it might as well be here and now.</p><p>\u201cSo!\u201d I smile winningly at Ed. \u201cReady?\u201d</p><p>The thing about the Charleston is, it\u2019s more energetic than you realize. And it\u2019s really complicated. And you have to be really coordinated. After an hour, my arms and legs are aching. It\u2019s relentless. It\u2019s worse than my Legs Bums and Tums class. It\u2019s like running a marathon.</p><p>\u201cAnd forward and back...\u201d the dance instructor is chanting. \u201cAnd swivel those feet...\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I can\u2019t swivel my feet anymore. They\u2019re going to fall off. I keep confusing right and left and bashing Ed in the ear by mistake.</p><p>\u201cCharleston... Charleston...\u201d The music is tripping along, filling the club with its peppy beat. The two leather-trousered guys at the bar have been watching in a silent stupor since we started the lesson. Apparently dance lessons are quite common here in the evenings. But everyone wants to learn salsa, according to Gaynor. She hasn\u2019t given a Charleston lesson for about fifteen years. I think she\u2019s quite chuffed we\u2019re here.</p><p>\u201cAnd step and kick... wave your arms... very good!\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m waving my hands so hard I\u2019m losing sensation in them. The fringes on my dress are swishing back and forth. Ed is doggedly crossing his hands back and forth over his knees. He shoots me a quick grin as I look at him, but I can tell he\u2019s concentrating too hard to talk. He\u2019s quite deft with his feet, actually. I\u2019m impressed.</p> <p>I glance over at Sadie, who\u2019s dancing in bliss. She\u2019s amazing. So much better than the teacher. Her legs are twinkling back and forth, she knows a zillion different steps, and she never seems to get out of breath.</p><p>Well. She doesn\u2019t have any breath, let\u2019s face it.</p><p>\u201cCharleston... Charleston...\u201d</p><p>Sadie catches my eyes, grins, and throws back her head in rapture. I guess it\u2019s been a long time since she\u2019s sparkled on the dance floor. I should have done this before. I feel really mean now. We\u2019ll do Charleston dancing every night from now on, I resolve. We\u2019ll do all her favorite twenties things.</p><p>The only trouble is, I\u2019ve got a stitch. Panting, I head to the side of the dance floor. What I need to do is to get Ed to dance with Sadie. The two of them alone. Somehow. Then I really will have made her evening.</p> <p>\u201cOK?\u201d Ed has followed me off.</p><p>\u201cYes. Fine.\u201d I mop my brow with a napkin. \u201cIt\u2019s hard work!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve done very well!\u201d Gaynor comes over to us and, in a sudden show of emotion, clasps our hands in turn. \u201cYou\u2019re very promising, the pair of you! I think you could go far! Shall I see you again next week?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr... maybe.\u201d I don\u2019t quite dare look at Ed. \u201cI\u2019ll call you, shall I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll leave the music on,\u201d she says enthusiastically. \u201cYou can practice!\u201d</p><p>As she goes, hurrying across the floor with her little dancer steps, I nudge Ed.</p> <p>\u201cHey, I want to watch you. Go and dance on your own for a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you crazy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo on! Please! You can do that one-two thing with your arms. I want to see how you do it. Please...\u201d</p><p>Rolling his eyes good-humoredly, Ed heads out on the floor.</p><p>\u201cSadie!\u201d I hiss, and gesture at Ed. \u201cQuick! Your partner\u2019s waiting!\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widen as she realizes what I mean. In half a second she\u2019s out there, facing him, her eyes lit up joyfully</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019d love to dance,\u201d I hear her saying. \u201cThank you so much!\u201d</p><p>As Ed starts swinging his legs back and forth, she synchronizes with him perfectly. She looks so happy. She looks so right. Her hands are on his shoulders, her bracelets are glittering under the lights, her headdress is bobbing, the music is fizzing along, it\u2019s like watching an old film-</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough,\u201d says Ed suddenly with a laugh. \u201cI need a partner.\u201d And to my dismay, he barges right through Sadie, toward me.</p><p>I can see the shock on Sadie\u2019s face. As she watches him leave the floor, she looks devastated. I wince, wishing so hard he could see her, that he knew...</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I mouth at Sadie as Ed drags me onto the floor. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry.\u201d</p><p>We dance awhile longer, then head back to the table. I can\u2019t help feeling exhilarated after all that effort, and Ed seems in pretty good spirits too.</p><p>\u201cEd, do you believe in guardian angels?\u201d I say on impulse. \u201cOr ghosts? Or spirits?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. None of the above. Why?\u201d</p><p>I lean forward confidentially. \u201cWhat if I told you that there\u2019s a guardian angel in this very room who fancies the pants off you?\u201d</p><p>Ed gives me a long look. \u201cIs \u2018guardian angel\u2019 a euphemism for \u2018male prostitute\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I splutter with laughter. \u201cForget it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had a good time.\u201d He drains his glass and smiles at me. A full-on, proper smile. Crinkled eyes, uncreased brow, everything! I almost want to shout \u201cGeronimo! We got there!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo have I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t expect to end the evening like this.\u201d He looks around the little club. \u201cBut it\u2019s... great!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDifferent.\u201d I nod.</p><p>He rips open a bag of peanuts and offers it to me, and I watch him as he crunches them hungrily. Even though he\u2019s looking relaxed, the frown lines are still faintly etched on his brow.</p><p>Well, no wonder. He\u2019s had a lot to frown about. I can\u2019t help feeling a rush of pity for him as I think about it. Losing his fianc\u00e9e. Coming to work in a strange city. Just getting through life, week after week, without enjoying it. It was probably really good for him to come dancing. It was probably the most fun he\u2019s had in months.</p><p>\u201cEd,\u201d I say on impulse. \u201cLet me take you sightseeing. You should see London. It\u2019s criminal that you haven\u2019t. I\u2019ll show you around. At the weekend sometime?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d like that.\u201d He seems genuinely touched. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem! Let\u2019s email.\u201d We smile at each other, and I drain my sidecar with a slight shudder. (Sadie made me order it. Totally revolting.)</p><p>Ed glances at his watch. \u201cSo, are you ready to go?\u201d</p><p>I glance over at the dance floor. Sadie\u2019s still going strong, flinging her arms and legs around with no sign of flagging. No wonder all the girls in the twenties were so skinny.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d I nod. Sadie can catch up with us when she\u2019s ready.</p> <p>We head out into the Mayfair night. The street lanterns are on, mist is rising from the pavements, and nobody\u2019s about. We head to the corner and after a few minutes flag down a couple of cabs. I\u2019m starting to shiver, in my skimpy dress and threadbare cloak. Ed ushers me into the first taxi, then pauses, holding the door open.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Lara,\u201d he says in that formal preppy way he has. I\u2019m actually starting to find it quite endearing. \u201cI had a good time. It was... quite a night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t it!\u201d I adjust my diamant\u00e9 cap, which has fallen lopsided with all the dancing, and Ed\u2019s mouth twitches with amusement.</p><p>\u201cSo, should I wear my spats for sightseeing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely.\u201d I smile. \u201cAnd a top hat.\u201d</p><p>Ed laughs. I think it\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve ever heard him laugh. \u201cGood night, twenties girl.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood night.\u201d I close the door and the taxi roars off.</p><p>SEVENTEEN</p><p>Next morning I feel a bit dazed. Charleston music is ringing in my ears and I keep having flashbacks to being The Great Lara. The whole thing feels like a dream.</p><p>Except it\u2019s not a dream, because Clare Fortescue\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9 is already in my in-box when I arrive at work. Result!</p><p>Kate\u2019s eyes are like saucers as I print out the email.</p><p>\u201cWho on earth\u2019s this?\u201d she says, poring over the r\u00e9sum\u00e9. \u201cLook, she\u2019s got an MBA! She\u2019s won a prize!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I say nonchalantly. \u201cShe\u2019s a top, award-winning marketing director. We networked last night. She\u2019s going on the Leonidas Sports short list.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd does she know she\u2019s going on the short list?\u201d says Kate in excitement.</p> <p>\u201cYes!\u201d I snap, flushing slightly. \u201cOf course she does.\u201d</p><p>By ten o\u2019clock the list has been finalized and sent off to Janet Grady. I flop back in my chair and grin at Kate, who\u2019s staring intently at her computer screen.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve found a picture of you!\u201d she says. \u201cFrom the dinner last night. Lara Lington and Ed Harrison arrive at the Business People dinner.\u201d She hesitates, looking puzzled. \u201cWho\u2019s he? I thought you were back with Josh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I am,\u201d I say at once. \u201cEd is just... a business contact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right.\u201d Kate is gazing at her computer screen, a little dreamily. \u201cHe\u2019s quite good-looking, isn\u2019t he? I mean, Josh is too,\u201d she amends hastily. \u201cIn a different way.\u201d</p><p>Honestly, she has no taste. Josh is a million times better-looking than Ed. Which reminds me, I haven\u2019t heard from him for a while. I\u2019d better call, just in case his phone has gone wrong and he\u2019s been sending texts and wondering why I haven\u2019t been answering.</p><p>I wait until Kate has gone to the bathroom so I have a little privacy, then dial his office.</p><p>\u201cJosh Barrett.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me,\u201d I say lovingly. \u201cHow was the trip?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, hi. It was great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMissed you!\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a pause. I\u2019m pretty sure Josh says something in response, but I can\u2019t quite hear.</p><p>\u201cI was wondering if your phone was going wrong?\u201d I add. \u201cBecause I haven\u2019t received any texts from you since yesterday morning.

Move on.</p><p>Briskly, I log on to my computer and find an email waiting in my in-box from Ed. Wow, that was quick off the mark.</p><p>Hi, twenties girl. Great evening last night. Re: your corporate travel insurance. Might want to look at this link. I\u2019ve heard they\u2019re good. Ed</p><p>I click on it and find a site offering reduced insurance rates for small companies. That\u2019s just like him: I mention a problem once, and he instantly finds a solution. Feeling touched, I click Reply and briskly type an email:</p><p>Thanks, twenties guy I appreciate it. Hope you\u2019re dusting off your London guide. PS: have you demonstrated the Charleston to your staff yet?</p><p>Immediately an answer pops back.</p><p>Is this your idea of blackmail?</p> <p>I giggle and start browsing online to find a picture of a dancing couple to send him.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s funny?\u201d says Sadie.</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d I close down the window. I won\u2019t tell Sadie I\u2019m emailing Ed. She\u2019s so possessive, she might take it the wrong way. Or, even worse, start dictating endless emails full of stupid twenties slang.</p><p>She starts reading the Grazia that\u2019s lying open on my desk and after a few moments orders me: \u201cTurn.\u201d This is her new habit. It\u2019s quite annoying, in fact. I\u2019ve become her page-turning slave.</p><p>\u201cHey, Lara!\u201d Kate comes rushing into the office. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a special delivery!\u201d</p><p>She hands me a bright pink envelope printed with butterflies and ladybugs, with Tutus and Pearls emblazoned across the top. I rip it open, to find a note from Diamant\u00e9\u2019s assistant.</p><p>Diamant\u00e9 thought you might like this. We look forward to seeing you later!</p><p>It\u2019s a printed sheet with details about the fashion show, together with a laminated card on a chain, reading VIP Backstage Pass . Wow. I\u2019ve never been a VIP before. I\u2019ve never even been an IP.</p><p>I turn the card over in my fingers, thinking ahead to this evening. Finally we\u2019ll get the necklace! After all this time. And then-</p><p>My thoughts stop abruptly. Then... what? Sadie said she couldn\u2019t rest until she got her necklace. That\u2019s why she\u2019s haunting me. That\u2019s why she\u2019s here. So when she gets it, what will happen? She can\u2019t...</p><p>I mean, she won\u2019t just...</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t just ... go ?</p><p>I stare at her, suddenly feeling a bit weird. This whole time, I\u2019ve only been focused on getting the necklace. I\u2019ve lost sight of what might happen beyond the necklace.</p><p>\u201cTurn,\u201d says Sadie impatiently, her eyes avidly fixed on an article about Katie Holmes. \u201cTurn!\u201d</p><p>In any case, I\u2019m resolved: I\u2019m not letting Sadie down this time. The minute I see this bloody necklace, I\u2019m grabbing it. Even if it\u2019s around someone\u2019s neck. Even if I have to rugby-tackle them to the floor. I approach the Sanderstead Hotel feeling all hyped up. My feet are springy and my hands are ready to snatch.</p><p>\u201cKeep your eyes peeled,\u201d I mutter to Sadie as we walk through the bare white lobby. Ahead of us, two skinny girls in miniskirts and heels are heading toward a pair of double doors decorated with swags of pink silk and butterfly helium balloons. That must be it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Nearing the room, I see a babble of well-dressed girls milling around, knocking back glasses of champagne while music thuds gently. There\u2019s a catwalk running through the center of the room, with a net of silver balloons strung above it, and rows of silk-swagged chairs.</p><p>I wait patiently as the girls ahead of me are ticked off, then I step forward to a blond girl in a pink prom dress. She\u2019s holding a clipboard and gives me a chilly smile. \u201cCan I help you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I nod. \u201cI\u2019m here for the fashion show.\u201d</p><p>She scans my top-to-toe black outfit dubiously. (Pencil trousers, camisole, little cropped jacket. I chose it especially because all fashionistas wear black, don\u2019t they?) \u201cAre you on the list?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d I reach for my invitation. \u201cI\u2019m Diamant\u00e9\u2019s cousin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, her cousin.\u201d Her smile becomes even more frozen. \u201cLovely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn fact, I need to talk to her before the show; do you know where she is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid Diamant\u00e9\u2019s tied up-\u201d the girl begins smoothly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s urgent. I really, really do need to see her. I\u2019ve got this, by the way.\u201d I brandish my VIP backstage pass at her. \u201cI could just go hunting. But if you could locate her it would help...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOK,\u201d the girl says after a pause. She reaches for her teeny jewel-encrusted phone and dials a number. \u201cSome cousin wants to see Diamant\u00e9; is she around?\u201d She adds in a barely concealed murmur, \u201cNo. Never saw her before. Well, if you say so...\u201d She puts her phone away. \u201cDiamant\u00e9 says she\u2019ll meet you backstage. Through there?\u201d She points down the corridor to another door.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead!\u201d I instruct Sadie in a whisper. \u201cSee if you can find the necklace backstage! It must be easy to spot!\u201d I follow a guy with a crate of Mo\u00ebt down the carpeted corridor and am flashing my VIP backstage pass at a bouncer when Sadie reappears.</p><p>\u201cEasy to spot?\u201d she says, her voice trembling. \u201cYou must be joking! We\u2019re never going to find it! Never!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I say anxiously as I walk in. \u201cWhat are you-\u201d</p><p>Oh no. Oh bloody hell.</p><p>I\u2019m standing in a large area filled with mirrors and chairs and hair dryers blasting and the chatter of makeup artists and about thirty models. They\u2019re all tall and skinny, slouching on their chairs or milling around talking on their mobile phones. They\u2019re all wearing skimpy diaphanous dresses. And they\u2019re all wearing at least twenty necklaces piled high around their necks. Chains, pearls, pendants... Everywhere I look there are necklaces. It\u2019s a necklace haystack.</p> <p>I\u2019m exchanging horrified looks with Sadie when I hear a drawling voice.</p><p>\u201cLara! You came!\u201d</p><p>I wheel around to see Diamant\u00e9 teetering toward me. She\u2019s wearing a tiny skirt covered in love hearts, a skinny vest, a studded silver belt, and patent stiletto shoe boots. She\u2019s holding two glasses of champagne, and she offers one to me.</p><p>\u201cHi, Diamant\u00e9. Congratulations! Thanks so much for inviting me. This is amazing!\u201d I gesture around the room, then take a deep breath. The important thing is not to seem too desperate or needy. \u201cSo, anyway.\u201d I aim for a light, casual tone. \u201cI have this huge favor to ask you. You know that dragonfly necklace that your father was after? The old one with the glass beads?\u201d</p><p>Diamant\u00e9 blinks at me in surprise. \u201cHow d\u2019you know about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr... long story. Anyway, it was originally Great-Aunt Sadie\u2019s, and my mum always loved it and I wanted to surprise her with it.\u201d My fingers are crossed tightly behind my back. \u201cSo, maybe after the show I could... er... have it? Possibly? If you didn\u2019t need it anymore?\u201d</p><p>Diamant\u00e9 stares back at me for a few moments, her blond hair streaming down her back and her eyes glazed.</p><p>\u201cMy dad\u2019s a fuckhead,\u201d she says at last, with emphasis.</p> <p>I stare at her uncertainly until the penny finally drops. Oh, great. This is all I need. She\u2019s pissed. She\u2019s probably been drinking champagne all day.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a fucking... fuckhead.\u201d She swigs her champagne.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say quickly. \u201cHe is. And that\u2019s why you need to give the necklace to me. To me ,\u201d I repeat, very loudly and clearly.</p><p>Diamant\u00e9\u2019s swaying on her shoe boots, and I grab her arm to steady her.</p><p>\u201cThe dragonfly necklace,\u201d I say. \u201cDo-you-know-where-it-is?\u201d</p><p>Diamant\u00e9 turns her face to survey me a minute, leaning so close I can smell champagne and cigarettes and Altoids on her breath. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHey, Lara, why aren\u2019t we friends? I mean, you\u2019re cool.\u201d She frowns slightly, then amends, \u201cNot cool, but... you know. Sound. Why don\u2019t we hang out?\u201d</p><p>Because you mostly hang out in your massive villa in Ibiza and I mostly hang out in the wrong end of Kilburn? Maybe?</p><p>\u201cEr... I dunno. We should. It\u2019d be great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe should get hair extensions together!\u201d she says, as though seized by inspiration. \u201cI go to this great place. They do your nails too. It\u2019s, like, totally organic and environmental.\u201d</p> <p>Environmental hair extensions?</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d I nod as convincingly as I can. \u201cLet\u2019s definitely do that. Hair extensions. Great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what you think of me, Lara.\u201d Her eyes suddenly focus with a kind of drunken sharpness. \u201cDon\u2019t think I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I\u2019m taken aback. \u201cI don\u2019t think anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I sponge off my dad. Because he paid for all this. Whatever. Be honest.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo!\u201d I say awkwardly. \u201cI don\u2019t think that! I just think... you know...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a spoiled little cow?\u201d She takes a gulp of champagne. \u201cGo on. Tell me.\u201d</p><p>My mind flips back and forth. Diamant\u00e9\u2019s never asked me for my opinion before, on anything. Should I be honest?</p><p>\u201cI just think that...\u201d I hesitate, then plunge in. \u201cMaybe if you waited a few years and did all this on your own, learned the craft and worked your way up, you\u2019d feel even better about yourself.\u201d</p><p>Diamant\u00e9 nods slowly, as though my words are getting through to her.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she says at last. \u201cYeah. I could do that, I suppose. \u2019Cept it would be really hard.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEr... well, that\u2019s kind of the point-\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then I\u2019d have an obnoxious fuckhead of a dad who thinks he\u2019s bloody God and makes us all be in his stupid documentary... and nothing in return! What\u2019s in it for me?\u201d She spreads her skinny tanned arms wide. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>OK. I\u2019m not getting into this debate.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re right,\u201d I say hastily. \u201cSo, about the dragonfly necklace-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, my dad found out you were coming today.\u201d Diamant\u00e9 doesn\u2019t even hear me. \u201cHe called me up. He was, like, what\u2019s she doing on the list? Take her off. I was like, fuck you! This is my fucking first cousin or whatever.\u201d</p><p>My heart misses a beat.</p><p>\u201cYour dad... didn\u2019t want me here?\u201d I lick my dry lips. \u201cDid he say why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said to him, who cares if she\u2019s a bit of a psycho?\u201d Diamant\u00e9 talks right through me. \u201cBe more fucking tolerant . Then, you know, he was on about that necklace.\u201d She opens her eyes wide. \u201cHe offered me all these substitutes. I was like, don\u2019t patronize me with fucking Tiffany . I\u2019m a designer, OK? I have a vision.\u201d</p> <p>The blood is beating hard in my ears. Uncle Bill is still after Sadie\u2019s necklace. I don\u2019t understand why. All I know is, I need to get hold of it.</p><p>\u201cDiamant\u00e9.\u201d I grab her shoulders. \u201cPlease listen. This necklace is really, really important to me. To my mum. I totally appreciate your vision as a designer and everything-but after the show, can I have it?\u201d</p><p>For a moment Diamant\u00e9 looks so blank, I think I\u2019m going to have to explain the whole thing again. Then she puts an arm around my neck and squeezes hard.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Course you can, babe. Soon as the show\u2019s over, \u2019s\u2019yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d I try not to give away how relieved I am. \u201cGreat! That\u2019s great! So where is it right now? Could I... see it?\u201d</p><p>The minute I clap eyes on this thing, I\u2019m grabbing it and running. I\u2019m not taking any more chances.</p><p>\u201cSure! Lyds?\u201d Diamant\u00e9 calls to a girl in a stripy top. \u201cD\u2019you know where that dragonfly necklace is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, babe?\u201d Lyds comes over, holding a mobile phone.</p><p>\u201cThe vintage necklace with the cute dragonfly. D\u2019you know where it is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt has yellow glass beads in a double row,\u201d I chime in urgently. \u201cDragonfly pendant, falls to about here...\u201d</p><p>Two models walk past, their necks piled high with necklaces, and I squint desperately at them.</p><p>Lyds is shrugging easily. \u201cDon\u2019t remember. It\u2019ll be on one of the girls somewhere.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019ll be in the haystack somewhere . I look around the room hopelessly. Models are everywhere. Necklaces are everywhere. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll look for it myself,\u201d I say. \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! The show\u2019s about to start!\u201d Diamant\u00e9 starts pushing me toward the door. \u201cLyds, take her in. Put her in the front row. That\u2019ll show Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut-\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s too late. I\u2019ve been ushered out.</p> <p>As the doors swing shut, I\u2019m hopping with frustration. It\u2019s in there. Somewhere in that room, Sadie\u2019s necklace is hanging around a model\u2019s neck. But which bloody one?</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t find it anywhere.\u201d Sadie suddenly appears beside me. To my horror, she seems almost in tears. \u201cI\u2019ve looked at every single girl. I\u2019ve looked at all the necklaces. It\u2019s nowhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt has to be!\u201d I mutter as we head back down the corridor. \u201cSadie, listen. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s on one of the models. We\u2019ll look really carefully at each one as they go past, and we\u2019ll find it. I promise.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m being as upbeat and convincing as I can, but inside... I\u2019m not so sure. I\u2019m not sure at all.</p><p>Thank God I\u2019m in the front row. As the show starts, the crowd is six deep, and everyone\u2019s so tall and skinny there\u2019s no way I would have got a view from further back. Music starts thudding and lights start flashing around the room, and there\u2019s a whoop from what must be a group of Diamant\u00e9\u2019s friends.</p> <p>\u201cGo, Diamant\u00e9!\u201d one of them yells.</p><p>To my slight horror, clouds of dry ice start to appear on the catwalk. How am I going to spot any models through that? Let alone any necklaces. Around me, people are coughing. \u201cDiamant\u00e9, we can\u2019t bloody see!\u201d yells some girl. \u201cTurn it off!\u201d</p><p>At last the fog starts to clear. Pink spotlights flash onto the catwalk and a Scissor Sisters track starts thumping through the speakers. I\u2019m leaning forward, alert for the first model, ready to concentrate as hard as I can, when I glimpse something out of the corner of my eye.</p><p>Opposite me on the other side of the catwalk, taking his seat in the front row, is Uncle Bill. He\u2019s dressed in a dark suit and open-necked shirt and accompanied by Damian, together with another assistant. As I stare in horror, he looks up and catches my eye.</p><p>My stomach lurches. I feel frozen.</p><p>After a minute he lifts a hand calmly in greeting. Numbly, I do the same. Then the music increases in volume and suddenly the first model is on the catwalk, wearing a white slip dress printed with spiderwebs and doing that sashay-model walk, all hip bones and cheekbones and skinny arms. I stare desperately at the necklaces jangling around her neck, but she whizzes past so quickly, it\u2019s almost impossible to get a good view.</p> <p>I glance over at Uncle Bill and feel a prickle of horror. He\u2019s scanning the necklaces too.</p><p>\u201cThis is useless!\u201d Sadie appears from nowhere and leaps up onto the catwalk. She goes right up to the model and peers intently at the jumble of chains and beads and charms around her neck. \u201cI can\u2019t see it! I told you, it\u2019s not there!\u201d</p><p>The next model appears, and in a flash she\u2019s examining that girl\u2019s necklaces too.</p><p>\u201cNot here either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuper collection,\u201d a girl next to me exclaims. \u201cDon\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr... yes,\u201d I say distractedly. \u201cGreat.\u201d I can\u2019t look at anything except the necklaces. My vision is a blur of beads and gilt and paste jewels. I\u2019m feeling a growing foreboding, a sense of failure-</p><p>Oh my God.</p><p>Oh my God oh my God! There it is! Right in front of me. Wound around a model\u2019s ankle. My heart is hammering as I stare breathlessly at the pale-yellow beads, casually twined into an anklet. An anklet . No wonder Sadie couldn\u2019t find it. As the model sashays nearer, the necklace is about two feet away from me on the catwalk. Less than that. I could lean over and grab it. This is absolutely unbearable...</p> <p>Sadie suddenly follows my gaze and gasps.</p><p>\u201cMy necklace!\u201d She zooms up to the oblivious model and yells, \u201cThat\u2019s mine! It\u2019s mine!\u201d</p><p>The moment that model is off the catwalk I\u2019m going after her and I\u2019m getting it. I don\u2019t care what it takes. I glance at Uncle Bill-and to my horror his eyes are glued on Sadie\u2019s necklace too.</p><p>The model is sashaying back now. She\u2019ll be off the catwalk in a minute. I glance across, squinting as a spotlight catches me right in the eye, and see Uncle Bill getting to his feet and his people clearing a way for him.</p><p>Shit. Shit .</p><p>I leap to my feet, too, and start making my way out, muttering apologies as I tread on people\u2019s feet. At least I have an advantage: I\u2019m on the side of the catwalk nearer the doors. Not daring to look back, I fling myself through the double doors and sprint up the corridor to the backstage area, flashing my pass at the bouncer guy on the door. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The backstage area is mayhem. A woman in jeans is barking instructions and pushing models onto the stage. Girls are ripping clothes off, having clothes put on, having their hair dried, having their lips touched up...</p><p>I look around in breathless panic. I\u2019ve already lost sight of my model. Where the hell is she? I start moving between all the hair stations, dodging rails of clothes, trying to catch a glimpse of her-when suddenly I become aware of a row at the door.</p><p>\u201cThis is Bill Lington, OK?\u201d It\u2019s Damian, and he\u2019s obviously losing it. \u201cBill Lington . Just because he doesn\u2019t have a backstage pass-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo backstage pass, no entry,\u201d I can hear the bouncer saying implacably. \u201cRules of the boss.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe is the fucking boss,\u201d snaps Damian. \u201cHe paid for all this, you moron.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat you call me?\u201d The bouncer sounds ominous, and I can\u2019t help smiling-but my smile dies away as Sadie materializes, her eyes dark and desperate.</p><p>\u201cQuick! Come!\u201d</p><p>I start to move, but Sadie vanishes. A moment later she reappears, looking wretched.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s gone!\u201d she gulps, hardly able to get the words out. \u201cThat model girl has taken my necklace. She was hailing a taxi and I dashed back to get you, but I knew you\u2019d be too slow. And when I returned to the street... she\u2019d gone!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA taxi?\u201d I stare at her in horror. \u201cBut... but-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve lost it again.\u201d Sadie seems beside herself. \u201cWe\u2019ve lost it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Diamant\u00e9 promised.\u201d I swivel my head frantically, looking for Diamant\u00e9. \u201cShe promised I could have it!\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m hollow with dismay. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019ve let it slip away again. I should have grabbed it, I should have been quicker, I should have been cleverer...</p><p>Massive cheers and whoops are coming from the main hall. The show must have finished. A moment later, models stream into the backstage area, followed by a pink-faced Diamant\u00e9.</p><p>\u201cFucking fantastic!\u201d she yells at everyone. \u201cYou all rock! I love you all! Now let\u2019s party!\u201d</p> <p>I struggle through the melee toward her, wincing as stilettos puncture my feet and shrieky voices pierce my eardrum.</p><p>\u201cDiamant\u00e9!\u201d I call over the hubbub. \u201cThe necklace! The girl wearing it has gone!\u201d</p><p>Diamant\u00e9 looks vague. \u201cWhich girl?\u201d</p><p>Jesus Christ. How many drugs is she on?</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s called Flora,\u201d Sadie says urgently in my ear.</p><p>\u201cFlora! I need Flora, but apparently she\u2019s gone!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Flora.\u201d Diamant\u00e9\u2019s brow clears. \u201cYeah, she\u2019s gone to Paris for a ball. On her dad\u2019s PJ. Private jet,\u201d she explains, at my blank look. \u201cI said she could wear her dress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she\u2019s taken the necklace too!\u201d I\u2019m trying really hard not to scream. \u201cDiamant\u00e9, please. Call her. Call her now. Tell her I\u2019ll meet her. I\u2019ll go to Paris, whatever it takes. I need to get hold of this necklace.\u201d</p> <p>Diamant\u00e9 gapes at me for a moment, then raises her eyes to heaven.</p><p>\u201cMy dad\u2019s right about you,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019re nuts. But I quite like that.\u201d She gets out her phone and speed-dials a number.</p><p>\u201cHey, Flora! Babe, you were awesome! So are you on the plane yet? OK, listen. Remember that dragonfly necklace you had on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnklet,\u201d I interject urgently. \u201cShe was wearing it as an anklet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe anklet thing?\u201d says Diamant\u00e9. \u201cYeah, that one. My crazy cousin really wants it. She\u2019s gonna come to Paris to get it. Where\u2019s the ball? Can she meet you?\u201d She listens for a while, lighting a cigarette and dragging on it. \u201cOh, right. Yeah. Totally... Of course...\u201d At last she looks up, blowing out a cloud of smoke. \u201cFlora doesn\u2019t know where the ball is. It\u2019s, like, some friend of her mum\u2019s holding it? She says she wants to wear the necklace \u2019cause it totally suits her dress, but then she\u2019ll FedEx it to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow morning? First thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, after the ball, yeah?\u201d says Diamant\u00e9, as though I\u2019m very slow and stupid. \u201cI dunno what day exactly, but as soon as she\u2019s done with it she\u2019ll send it. She promised. Isn\u2019t that perfect?\u201d She beams and lifts her hand to give me a high-five.</p><p>I stare back at her in disbelief. Perfect?</p><p>The necklace was two feet away from me. It was within my reach. It was promised to me. And now it\u2019s on its way to Paris and I don\u2019t know when I\u2019ll get it back. How can this in any way be perfect? I feel like having a total meltdown. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But I don\u2019t dare. There\u2019s only the thinnest, most fragile chain linking me to the necklace now, and the strongest link in it is Diamant\u00e9. If I piss her off I\u2019ll lose it forever.</p><p>\u201cPerfect!\u201d I force myself to smile back and high-five Diamant\u00e9. I take the phone and dictate my address to Flora, spelling out every single word twice.</p><p>Now all I can do is cross all my fingers. And my toes. And wait.</p><p>EIGHTEEN</p> <p>He\u2019ll get the necklace back. I have to believe it. I do believe it.</p><p>But, still, both Sadie and I have been on edge since last night. Sadie snapped when I stood on her toe this morning (through her toe, more accurately), and I told her off for criticizing my makeup. The truth is, I feel like I\u2019ve failed her. The necklace has been within my reach twice. And each time I\u2019ve let it get away. Anxiety is gnawing inside me, making me uptight and defensive.</p><p>This morning I woke up wondering if I should just get on a train to Paris. But how would I ever track Flora down? Where would I start? I feel totally powerless.</p><p>Neither of us is chatting much this morning; in fact, Sadie has been silent for a while. As I finish typing my emails at work, I watch her staring out the window, her back rigid. She\u2019s never said so, but it must be lonely for her, wafting around the world with only me to talk to.</p><p>Sighing, I shut down my computer, wondering where the necklace is right this minute. In Paris somewhere. Around that girl Flora\u2019s neck, maybe. Or in an open bag, carelessly left on an open-top-car seat.</p> <p>My stomach feels all stabby and nauseous again. I have to stop this or I\u2019ll turn into Mum. I can\u2019t keep obsessing about what might happen or what might go wrong. The necklace will come back. I have to believe it. Meanwhile, I have a life to lead. I have a boyfriend to meet for lunch.</p><p>I push back my chair, shrug on my jacket, and grab my bag.</p><p>\u201cSee you later,\u201d I say toward both Kate and Sadie, and head out of the office hurriedly before either can reply. I don\u2019t want any company. I\u2019m feeling a bit jittery about seeing Josh again, to be honest. I mean, it\u2019s not like I have any doubts or anything. Nothing like that. I suppose I\u2019m just... apprehensive.</p><p>What I\u2019m really not in the mood for is Sadie suddenly appearing beside me as I\u2019m nearly at the tube station.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d she demands.</p><p>\u201cNowhere.\u201d I hurry on, trying to ignore her. \u201cLeave me alone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re meeting Josh, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you knew, then why did you bother asking?\u201d I say childishly. \u201cExcuse me...\u201d I swing around a corner, trying to shake her off. But she won\u2019t be shaken.</p><p>\u201cAs your guardian angel, I insist that you see sense,\u201d she says crisply. \u201cJosh is not in love with you, and if you think for a moment he is, you\u2019re even more self-deceiving than I thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said you weren\u2019t my guardian angel,\u201d I say over my shoulder. \u201cSo butt out, old lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me old!\u201d she says in outrage. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not going to let you throw yourself away on some lily-livered, weak-willed puppet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not a puppet,\u201d I snap, then run down the tube steps. I can hear the train coming, so I swipe my Oyster card, dash onto the platform, and make it onto the tube just in time.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t even love him.\u201d Sadie\u2019s voice follows me. \u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>This is the final outrage. I\u2019m so incensed I swivel to face her, whipping out my phone. \u201cOf course I do! Why do you think I\u2019ve been so miserable? Why would I want him back if I didn\u2019t love him?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTo prove to everyone that you\u2019re right.\u201d She folds her arms.</p><p>This one takes me by surprise. In fact, it takes me a moment to gather my thoughts.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just... rubbish! That shows how little you know! It\u2019s got nothing to do with that! I love Josh, and he loves me...\u201d I trail off as I feel the attention of all the travelers in the carriage turning toward me.</p><p>I stump to a corner seat, pursued by Sadie. As she draws breath to launch into another speech, I take out my iPod and put it on. A moment later her voice is drowned out.</p><p>Perfect! I should have thought of this a long time ago.</p><p>I suggested to Josh that we meet at Bistro Martin, just to exorcise all memories of that stupid Marie. As I hand in my coat I see him, already sitting at the table, and feel a whoosh of relief, mixed with vindication.</p><p>\u201cYou see?\u201d I can\u2019t help muttering to Sadie. \u201cHe\u2019s early. Now tell me he doesn\u2019t care for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t know his own mind.\u201d She shakes her head dismissively. \u201cHe\u2019s like a ventriloquist\u2019s dummy. I told him what to say. I told him what to think.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She\u2019s such a bighead.</p><p>\u201cLook, you,\u201d I say angrily. \u201cYou\u2019re not as powerful as you think you are, OK? Josh is pretty strong-minded, if you want to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarling, I could make him dance on the table and sing \u2018Baa Baa, Black Sheep\u2019 if I wanted to!\u201d she replies scornfully. \u201cMaybe I will! Then you\u2019ll see sense!\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s no point arguing with her. Deliberately, I barge right through her and head to Josh\u2019s table, ignoring her squeals of protest. Josh is pushing his chair back and the light is catching his hair, and his eyes are as soft and blue as ever. As I reach him, something bubbles up in my stomach. Happiness, maybe. Or love. Or triumph.</p> <p>Like, a mixture.</p><p>I reach up for a hug and his lips meet mine, and all I can think is Yessss! After a minute he moves to sit down, but I pull him back into another passionate kiss. I\u2019ll show Sadie who\u2019s in love.</p><p>At last he really does pull away, and we sit down. I lift the glass of white wine Josh has already ordered for me.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d I say, a bit breathless. \u201cHere we are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere we are.\u201d Josh nods.</p> <p>\u201cHere\u2019s to us! Isn\u2019t it wonderful, being back together again? At our favorite restaurant? I\u2019ll always associate this restaurant with you,\u201d I add a bit pointedly. \u201cNo one else. I never could.\u201d</p><p>Josh has the grace to look a bit uncomfortable. \u201cHow\u2019s work?\u201d he asks quickly.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d I sigh. \u201cActually, to be honest... not that fine. Natalie\u2019s gone off to Goa and left me all alone to run the company. It\u2019s been a bit of a nightmare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Josh says. \u201cThat\u2019s bad.\u201d He picks up the menu and starts reading as though the subject\u2019s closed, and I feel a tiny pinprick of frustration. I was expecting more of a response. Although, now I remember, Josh never does respond to stuff much. He\u2019s so easygoing. It\u2019s what I love about him, I quickly remind myself: his lovely laid-back nature. He never stresses. He never overreacts. He never gets ratty. His approach to life is: Just get along . Which is so sane .</p><p>\u201cWe should go to Goa one day!\u201d I change the subject, and Josh\u2019s brow clears.</p><p>\u201cDefinitely. It\u2019s supposed to be great. You know, I\u2019m really into the idea of taking some time off. Like six months or so.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe could do it together!\u201d I say joyfully. \u201cWe could both give up our jobs, we could travel around, start off in Mumbai-\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t start planning it all,\u201d he says in suddenly tetchy tones. \u201cDon\u2019t hem me in. Jesus!\u201d</p><p>I stare at him in shock. \u201cJosh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d He looks taken aback by himself too. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. At least...\u201d He rubs his head roughly with both hands, then looks up, confused. \u201cI know this is great, you and me being back together. I know I\u2019m the one who wanted it. But sometimes I have this flash of... what the fuck are we doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou see?\u201d Sadie\u2019s crowing voice above the table makes me jump. She\u2019s hovering above us like an avenging angel.</p><p>Focus. Don\u2019t look up. Pretend she\u2019s just a big lamp shade .</p> <p>\u201cI... I think that\u2019s pretty normal,\u201d I say, determinedly gazing at Josh. \u201cWe\u2019ve both got to adjust; it\u2019ll take time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not normal!\u201d Sadie cries impatiently. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t really want to be here! I told you, he\u2019s a puppet! I can make him say or do anything! You want to marry Lara one day!\u201d says Sadie loudly into Josh\u2019s ear. \u201cTell her!\u201d</p><p>Josh\u2019s look of confusion deepens.</p><p>\u201cAlthough I do think... one day... maybe you and I should... get married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn a beach!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn a beach,\u201d he repeats obediently.</p><p>\u201cAnd have six children!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like loads of kids too,\u201d he says bashfully. \u201cFour... or five... or even six. What do you think?\u201d</p><p>I dart Sadie a look of hatred. She\u2019s spoiling everything with her stupid party trick.</p><p>\u201cHold that thought, Josh,\u201d I say as pleasantly as I can. \u201cI just need to go to the loo.\u201d</p><p>I have never moved so quickly as I do across that restaurant. In the ladies\u2019, I bang the door shut and glower at Sadie.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProving a point. He has no mind of his own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe does!\u201d I say furiously. \u201cAnd, anyway, just because you\u2019re prompting him to say these things, it doesn\u2019t prove he doesn\u2019t love me. He probably does want to get married to me, deep down! and have lots of kids!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou think so,\u201d Sadie says scoffingly.</p><p>\u201cYes!

Challenge accepted.\u201d She zooms toward the door.</p><p>\u201cWhat challenge?\u201d I say in horror. \u201cI didn\u2019t challenge you!\u201d</p> <p>I hurry back into the restaurant-but Sadie streaks ahead of me. I can see her yelling in Josh\u2019s ear. I can see his eyes glazing over. I can\u2019t get to the table because I\u2019m stuck behind a waiter with about five plates. What the hell is she doing to him?</p><p>All of a sudden Sadie appears beside me again. Her lips are pressed together as though she\u2019s trying not to laugh.</p><p>\u201cWhat have you done?\u201d I snap.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see.

But you\u2019ll still see I\u2019m right!\u201d</p><p>She vanishes and I approach the table nervously. Josh looks up with that faraway, punch-drunk expression, and my heart sinks. Sadie obviously got through to him, big-time. What\u2019s she been saying?</p><p>\u201cSo!\u201d I begin brightly. \u201cHave you decided what to eat yet?\u201d</p><p>Josh doesn\u2019t even seem to hear. It\u2019s as though he\u2019s in a trance.</p><p>\u201cJosh!\u201d I snap my fingers. \u201cJosh, wake up!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. I was miles away. Lara, I\u2019ve been thinking.\u201d He leans forward and gazes at me with great intensity. \u201cI think I should become an inventor.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAn inventor?\u201d I gape at him.</p><p>\u201cAnd I should move to Switzerland.\u201d Josh is nodding seriously. \u201cIt\u2019s just come to me, out of nowhere. This amazing... insight. I have to change my life. At once.\u201d</p><p>I will murder her.</p><p>\u201cJosh...\u201d I try to keep calm. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to move to Switzerland. You don\u2019t want to be an inventor. You work in advertising.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no.\u201d His eyes are shining as if he\u2019s a pilgrim who\u2019s seen the Blessed Virgin. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand. I\u2019ve been on the wrong path. It\u2019s all falling into place. I want to go to Geneva and retrain in astrophysics.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not a scientist!\u201d My voice is shrill. \u201cHow can you be an astrophysicist?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut maybe I was meant to study science,\u201d he says fervently. \u201cDidn\u2019t you ever hear a voice inside your head, telling you to change your life? Telling you that you\u2019re on the wrong path?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but you don\u2019t listen to the voice!\u201d I lose all semblance of composure. \u201cYou ignore the voice! You say, \u2018That\u2019s a stupid voice!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow can you say that?\u201d Josh looks taken aback. \u201cLara, you have to listen to yourself. You\u2019re the one who always told me that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I didn\u2019t mean-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just sitting here, minding my own business, when the inspiration came to me.\u201d He\u2019s overflowing with enthusiasm. \u201cLike an epiphany. Like a realization. Like when I realized I should be back with you. It\u2019s exactly the same.\u201d</p><p>His words are like a splinter of ice in my heart. For a few moments I can\u2019t bring myself to speak.</p><p>\u201cIs it... exactly the same?\u201d I say at last.</p><p>\u201cWell, of course.\u201d Josh peers at me uncomprehendingly. \u201cLara, don\u2019t get upset.\u201d He reaches across the table. \u201cCome with me to Geneva. We\u2019ll start a new life. And do you want to know the other idea I\u2019ve just had, out of the blue?\u201d His face glows with happiness as he draws breath. \u201cI want to open a zoo. What do you think?\u201d</p><p>I want to cry. I think I might cry.</p><p>\u201cJosh-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, hear me out.\u201d He slaps a hand on the table. \u201cWe start an animal charity. Endangered species. We hire experts, get some funding...\u201d</p><p>Tears are welling up in my eyes as he talks. OK , I\u2019m saying savagely to Sadie in my mind. I get it. I GET it .</p><p>\u201cJosh.\u201d I cut him right off. \u201cWhy did you want to get back together with me?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s silence. Josh still has that trancey look in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember.\u201d His brow creases in a frown. \u201cSomething just told me it was the right thing to do. This voice in my head. It told me I still loved you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut after you heard the voice.\u201d I try not to sound too desperate. \u201cDid it seem like all your old feelings for me were kicking in? Like an old car after you turn the handle round and round and it\u2019s sputtering and then suddenly the engine comes to life. Did anything come to life?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Josh looks as though I\u2019ve asked him a trick question. \u201cWell, it was like I heard this voice in my head-\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget the voice!\u201d I practically scream at him. \u201cWas there anything else?\u201d</p><p>Josh frowns irritably. \u201cWhat else would there be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe photo of us!\u201d I\u2019m scrabbling desperately. \u201cOn your phone.

I\u2019m just circling the rim of my wineglass around and around with my finger, unable to look up. I was so convinced. I was so sure that once he was back with me he\u2019d realize. We\u2019d click. It would be fantastic, like it was before.</p><p>But maybe I\u2019ve been thinking about a different Josh all this time. There was real-life Josh and there was Josh-in-my-head. And they were almost, almost exactly the same, except for one tiny detail.</p> <p>One loved me and the other one didn\u2019t.</p><p>I lift my head and look at him now as though for the first time. At his handsome face; his T-shirt with some obscure band logo, the silver bracelet he always wears around his wrist. He\u2019s still the same person. There\u2019s nothing wrong with him. It\u2019s just... I\u2019m not the violin to his bow.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever been to Geneva?\u201d Josh is saying, and my thoughts are wrenched back to the present.</p><p>For God\u2019s sake. Geneva. A zoo. How did Sadie think of all this stuff? She\u2019s totally screwed with his mind. She\u2019s so irresponsible.</p><p>Thank God she\u2019s stuck to meddling with my love life, I think grimly. Thank God she hasn\u2019t gone around trying to influence any world leaders or anything. She would have caused global meltdown.</p><p>\u201cJosh, listen,\u201d I say at last. \u201cI don\u2019t think you should move to Geneva. Or train as an astrophysicist. Or open a zoo. Or...\u201d I swallow hard, psyching myself up to say it. \u201cOr... be with me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think this is all a mistake.\u201d I gesture at the table. \u201cAnd... it\u2019s my fault. I\u2019m sorry for pestering you all this time, Josh. I should have let you get on with your life. I won\u2019t bother you again.\u201d</p><p>Josh looks poleaxed. But then, he\u2019s looked fairly poleaxed throughout most of the conversation.</p><p>\u201cAre you... sure?\u201d he says feebly.</p><p>\u201cTotally.\u201d As the waiter approaches the table, I close the menu I\u2019m holding. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to eat anything after all. Just the bill, please.\u201d</p><p>As I walk back to the office from the tube, I feel almost numb. I turned Josh down. I told him we weren\u2019t right together.

So easily .</p><p>\u201cSo!\u201d Sadie\u2019s voice jolts me out of my reverie. She\u2019s obviously been waiting for me. \u201cDid I prove a point? Don\u2019t tell me, it\u2019s all over between you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGeneva?\u201d I say coldly. \u201cAstrophysics?\u201d</p><p>Sadie bursts into giggles. \u201cToo funny!\u201d</p><p>She thinks it\u2019s all just entertainment. I hate her.</p><p>\u201cSo what happened?\u201d She\u2019s bobbing around, her face lit up with glee. \u201cDid he say he wanted to open a zoo?\u201d</p><p>She wants to hear that she was completely right and it\u2019s all over and it was all down to her super-skills, doesn\u2019t she? Well, I\u2019m not going to give her the satisfaction. I\u2019m not going to have her exulting over me. Even if she was completely right and it is all over and it was all down to her super-skills.</p><p>\u201cZoo?\u201d I adopt a perplexed expression. \u201cNo, Josh never mentioned any zoo. Should he have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Sadie stops bobbing.</p><p>\u201cHe mentioned Geneva briefly, but then he realized that was a ridiculous idea. Then he said he\u2019d been hearing this really annoying, whiny voice in his head recently.\u201d I shrug. \u201cHe said he was sorry if he hadn\u2019t been making much sense. But the most important thing was, he wanted to be with me. And then we agreed to take things slowly and sensibly.\u201d I stride on, avoiding her eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou mean... you\u2019re still seeing each other?\u201d Sadie sounds astounded. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOf course we are,\u201d I say, as though surprised she\u2019s even asking. \u201cYou know, it takes more than a ghost with a loud voice to break up a real relationship.\u201d</p><p>Sadie looks utterly flummoxed.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be serious.\u201d She finds her voice. \u201cYou can\u2019t be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I am,\u201d I shoot back, as my phone buzzes with a text. I glance down, and it\u2019s from Ed.</p> <p>Hey. R u still on for sightseeing on Sunday? E</p><p>\u201cThat was from Josh.\u201d I smile lovingly at my phone. \u201cWe\u2019re meeting up on Sunday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo get married and have six children?\u201d says Sadie sarcastically. But she sounds on the defensive.</p><p>\u201cYou know, Sadie,\u201d I give her a patronizing smile, \u201cyou may be able to sway people\u2019s heads. But you can\u2019t sway their hearts.\u201d</p><p>Ha. Take that, ghostie .</p> <p>Sadie glowers at me, and I can tell she can\u2019t think of a reply. She looks so disconcerted, I almost feel cheered up. I swing around the corner and into the door of our building.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a girl in your office, by the way,\u201d says Sadie, following me. \u201cI don\u2019t like the look of her one little bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGirl? What girl?\u201d I hurry up the stairs, wondering if Shireen has come by. I push open the door, stride in-and stop dead with shock.</p><p>It\u2019s Natalie.</p><p>What the hell is Natalie doing here?</p><p>She\u2019s right there in front of me. Sitting in my chair. Talking on my phone. She\u2019s looking deeply tanned and wearing a white shirt with a navy pencil skirt, and laughing throatily at something. As she sees me, she demonstrates no surprise, just gives me a wink.</p> <p>\u201cWell, thanks, Janet. I\u2019m glad you appreciate the work,\u201d she says in her confident, drawling way. \u201cYou\u2019re right-Clare Fortescue has hidden her light under a bushel. Hugely talented. Perfect for you. I was determined to woo her... No, thank you . That\u2019s my job, Janet, that\u2019s why you pay me my commission...\u201d She gives that deep, throaty laugh again.</p><p>I shoot a shocked glance over at Kate, who gives me a helpless shrug.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be in touch.\u201d Natalie\u2019s still talking. \u201cYeah, I\u2019ll talk to Lara. She obviously has a few things to learn, but... Well, yes, I did have to pick up the pieces, but she\u2019s a promising girl. Don\u2019t write her off.\u201d She winks at me again. \u201cOK, thanks, Janet. We\u2019ll do lunch. Take care now.\u201d As I stare in disbelief, Natalie puts down the phone, swivels around, and smiles at me lazily. \u201cSo. How\u2019s tricks?\u201d</p><p>NINETEEN</p><p>It\u2019s Sunday morning, and I\u2019m still seething. At myself. How could I be so lame?</p><p>On Friday I was so shocked that somehow I let Natalie take charge of the situation. I didn\u2019t confront her. I didn\u2019t make any of my points. They were all buzzing around my head like trapped flies.</p><p>I know now all the things I should have said to her. I should have said, \u201cYou can\u2019t just come back and act like nothing\u2019s happened.\u201d And: \u201cHow about an apology for leaving us in the lurch?\u201d And: \u201cDon\u2019t you dare take credit for finding Clare Fortescue; that was all down to me!\u201d</p><p>And maybe even: \u201cSo you were fired from your last job, huh? When were you planning to tell me that?\u201d</p> <p>But I didn\u2019t say any of those things. I just gasped and said feebly, \u201cNatalie! Wow! How come you\u2019re-What-\u201d</p><p>And she launched into a long story about how the guy in Goa turned out to be a two-timing asshole, and there\u2019s only so much downtime you can have before you go crazy, and she\u2019d decided to surprise me, and wasn\u2019t I relieved?</p><p>\u201cNatalie,\u201d I began, \u201cit\u2019s been really stressy with you gone-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWelcome to big business.\u201d She winked at me. \u201cStress comes with the territory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you just disappeared! We didn\u2019t have any warning! We had to pick up all the pieces-\u201d</p><p>\u201cLara.\u201d She held out a hand, as though to say, Calm down . \u201cI know. It was tough. But it\u2019s OK. Whatever fuckups happened while I was gone, I\u2019m here to put them right. Hello, Graham?\u201d She turned to the phone. \u201cNatalie Masser here.\u201d</p><p>And she carried on all afternoon, moving seamlessly from phone call to phone call, so I couldn\u2019t get a word in. As she left for the evening, she was gabbing on her mobile and just gave Kate and me a casual wave.</p><p>So that\u2019s it. She\u2019s back. She\u2019s acting like she\u2019s the boss and she did nothing wrong and we should all be really grateful to her for coming back.</p><p>If she winks at me one more time, I will throttle her.</p><p>Miserably, I wrench my hair into a ponytail. I\u2019m barely making any effort today. Sightseeing does not require a flapper dress. And Sadie still thinks I\u2019m going out with Josh, so she\u2019s not bossing me around for once. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I eye Sadie surreptitiously as I do my blusher. I feel a bit bad, lying to her. But then, she shouldn\u2019t have been so obnoxious.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you coming along,\u201d I warn her for the millionth time. \u201cDon\u2019t even think about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t dream of coming along!\u201d she retorts, affronted. \u201cYou think I want to trail along beside you and the ventriloquist\u2019s dummy? I\u2019m going to watch television. There\u2019s a Fred Astaire special today. Edna and I will have a lovely day together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Well, give her my love,\u201d I say sarcastically.</p> <p>Sadie\u2019s found an old woman called Edna who lives a few streets away and does nothing but watch black-and-white films. She goes there most days now, sits on the sofa beside Edna, and watches a movie. She says the only problem comes when Edna gets phone calls and talks through the movie-so now she\u2019s taken to yelling, \u201cShut up! Finish your phone call!\u201d right in Edna\u2019s ear. Whereupon Edna gets all flustered and sometimes even thrusts the phone down mid-sentence.</p><p>Poor Edna.</p><p>I finish doing my blusher and stare at my reflection. Black skinny jeans, silver ballet pumps, a T-shirt, and a leather jacket. Normal, 2009-style makeup. Ed probably won\u2019t recognize me. I should stick a feather in my hair just so he knows it\u2019s me.</p><p>The thought makes me snort with laughter, and Sadie glances at me suspiciously.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s funny?\u201d She looks me up and down. \u201cAre you going out like that? I\u2019ve never seen such a dull ensemble. Josh will take one look at you and expire of boredom. If you don\u2019t expire of boredom first.\u201d</p> <p>Oh, ha ha. But maybe she has a point. Maybe I\u2019ve dressed down too much.</p><p>I find myself reaching for one of my twenties vintage necklaces and looping it around my neck. The silver and jet beads fall down in rows and click together as I move, and at once I feel a bit more interesting. More glamorous.</p><p>I line my lips again in a darker color, giving them a bit more of a twenties shape. Then I pick up a vintage silver leather clutch and survey myself again.</p><p>\u201cMuch better!\u201d says Sadie. \u201cAnd what about a darling little cloche?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks.\u201d I roll my eyes.</p><p>\u201cIf it were me, I\u2019d wear a hat,\u201d she persists.</p> <p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t want to look like you.\u201d I throw back my hair and smile at myself. \u201cI want to look like me.\u201d</p><p>I suggested to Ed that we start off our tour at the Tower of London, and as I come out of the tube station into the crisp air, I feel immediately cheered. Never mind about Natalie. Never mind about Josh. Never mind about the necklace. Look at all this. It\u2019s fantastic! Ancient stone battlements, towering against the blue sky as they have done for centuries. Beefeaters wandering about in their red and navy costumes, like something out of a fairy tale. This is the kind of place that makes you feel proud to be a born-and-bred Londoner. How could Ed not even have bothered to come here? It\u2019s, like, one of the wonders of the world!</p><p>Come to think of it, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve ever actually visited the Tower of London myself. I mean, gone in or anything. But that\u2019s different. I live here. I don\u2019t have to.</p><p>\u201cLara! Over here!\u201d</p><p>Ed\u2019s already in the queue for tickets. He\u2019s wearing jeans and a gray T-shirt. He hasn\u2019t shaved, either, which is interesting. I had him down as someone who\u2019d look smart even at the weekend. As I draw near, he looks me up and down with a little smile.</p><p>\u201cSo you do sometimes wear clothes from the twenty-first century.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery occasionally.\u201d I grin back.</p><p>\u201cI was convinced you were going to turn up in another twenties dress. In fact, I found an accessory for myself. Just to keep you company.\u201d He reaches in his pocket and produces a small rectangular case made of battered silver. He springs it open and I see a deck of playing cards.</p> <p>\u201cCool!\u201d I say, impressed. \u201cWhere did you get this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBid for it on eBay.\u201d He shrugs. \u201cI always carry a deck of cards. It\u2019s 1925,\u201d he adds, showing me a tiny hallmark.</p><p>I can\u2019t help feeling touched that he went to that effort.</p><p>\u201cI love it.\u201d I look up as we arrive at the head of the queue. \u201cTwo adults, please. This is on me,\u201d I add firmly as Ed makes to get out his wallet. \u201cI\u2019m the host.\u201d</p><p>I buy the tickets and a book called Historic London and lead Ed to a spot in front of the tower.</p><p>\u201cSo, this building you see before you is the Tower of London,\u201d I begin in a knowledgeable, tour-leader tone. \u201cOne of our most important and ancient monuments. One of many, many wonderful sights. It\u2019s criminal to come to London and not find out more about our amazing heritage.\u201d I look at Ed severely. \u201cIt\u2019s really narrow-minded, plus you don\u2019t have anything like it in America.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d He looks suitably chastened as he surveys the tower. \u201cThis is spectacular.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it great?\u201d I say proudly.</p><p>There are some times when being English is really the best, and big-historic-castle time is one of them.</p><p>\u201cWhen was it built?\u201d asks Ed.</p> <p>\u201cUm...\u201d I look around for a handy sign. There isn\u2019t one. Damn. There should be a sign. I can\u2019t exactly look it up in the guidebook. Not with him watching me expectantly.</p><p>\u201cIt was in the...\u201d I turn casually away and mumble something indistinct. \u201c... teenth century.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich century?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt dates from...\u201d I clear my throat. \u201cTudor. Er... Stuart times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you mean Norman?\u201d suggests Ed politely.</p> <p>\u201cOh. Yes, that\u2019s what I meant.\u201d I dart him a suspicious look. How did he know that? Has he been boning up?</p><p>\u201cSo, we go in this way.\u201d I lead Ed confidently toward a likely-looking rampart, but he pulls me back.</p><p>\u201cActually, I think the entrance is this way, by the river.\u201d</p><p>For God\u2019s sake. He\u2019s obviously one of these men who have to take control. He probably never asks for directions either.</p><p>\u201cListen, Ed,\u201d I say kindly. \u201cYou\u2019re American. You\u2019ve never been here before. Who\u2019s more likely to know the way in, me or you?\u201d</p><p>At that moment, a passing Beefeater stops and gives us a friendly beam. I smile back, ready to ask him the best way in, but he addresses Ed cheerily.</p> <p>\u201cMorning, Mr. Harrison. How are you? Back again already?\u201d</p><p>What?</p><p>What just happened? Ed knows the Beefeaters? How does Ed know the Beefeaters?</p><p>I\u2019m speechless as Ed shakes the hand of the Beefeater and says, \u201cGood to see you, Jacob. Meet Lara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr... hello,\u201d I manage feebly.</p><p>What\u2019s going to happen next? Will the queen arrive and ask us in for tea?</p><p>\u201cOK,\u201d I splutter as soon as the Beefeater has continued on his way. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>Ed takes one look at my face and bursts into laughter.</p> <p>\u201cTell me!\u201d I demand, and he lifts his hands apologetically.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come clean. I was here Friday. It was a work team-building day out. We were able to talk to some of the Beefeaters. It was fascinating.\u201d He pauses, then adds, his mouth twitching, \u201cThat\u2019s how I know the tower was begun in 1078. By William the Conqueror. And the entrance is this way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could have told me!\u201d I glare at him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. You seemed so into the idea, and I thought it would be cool to go around with you. But we can go someplace else. You must have seen this a million times. Let\u2019s rethink.\u201d He takes the Historic London guidebook and starts consulting the index.</p><p>I\u2019m flipping the tickets back and forth in my hands, watching a group of schoolkids take pictures of one another, feeling torn. Obviously he\u2019s right. He saw the tower on Friday so why on earth would we go around it again?</p><p>On the other hand, we\u2019ve bought the tickets now. And it looks amazing. And I want to see it.</p><p>\u201cWe could head straight down to St. Paul\u2019s.\u201d Ed is peering at the tube map. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t take too long-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to see the Crown jewels,\u201d I say in a small voice.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He raises his head.</p><p>\u201cI want to see the Crown jewels. Now we\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean... you\u2019ve never seen them?\u201d Ed stares incredulously at me. \u201cYou\u2019ve never seen the Crown jewels?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI live in London!\u201d I say, nettled at his expression. \u201cIt\u2019s different! I can see them anytime I want, when the occasion arises. It\u2019s just that... the occasion has never arisen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that a bit narrow-minded of you, Lara?\u201d I can tell Ed\u2019s loving this. \u201cAren\u2019t you interested in the heritage of your great city? Don\u2019t you think it\u2019s criminal to ignore these unique historic monuments-\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d I can feel my cheeks turning red.</p><p>Ed relents. \u201cCome on. Let me show you your own country\u2019s fine Crown jewels. They\u2019re great. I know the whole deal. You realize that the oldest pieces date from the Restoration?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d He starts guiding me through the crowd. \u201cThe Imperial State Crown contains an enormous diamond cut from the famous Cullinan Diamond, the largest diamond ever mined.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d I say politely. Obviously Ed memorized the entire Crown jewels lecture yesterday.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d He nods. \u201cAt least, that\u2019s what the world thought until 1997. When it was discovered to be a fake.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cReally?\u201d I stop dead. \u201cIt\u2019s fake?\u201d</p><p>Ed\u2019s mouth twitches. \u201cJust checking you\u2019re listening.\u201d</p><p>We see the jewels and we see the ravens and we see the White Tower and the Bloody Tower.

We wander through the Medieval Palace, past two guys in medieval costume doing medieval writing (I guess), and find ourselves in a room with tiny castle windows and a massive fireplace.</p> <p>\u201cOK, clever clogs. Tell me about that cupboard.\u201d I point randomly at a small, nondescript door set in the wall. \u201cDid Walter Raleigh grow potatoes in there or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see.\u201d Ed consults the guidebook. \u201cAh, yes. This is where the Seventh Duke of Marmaduke kept his wigs. An interesting historical figure, he beheaded many of his wives. Others he cryogenically froze. He also invented the medieval version of the popcorn maker. Or ye poppecorn, as it was known.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, really?\u201d I adopt a serious tone.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll obviously have learned about the poppecorn craze of 1583.\u201d Ed squints at the guidebook. \u201cApparently Shakespeare very nearly called Much Ado About Nothing, Much Ado About Ye Poppecorn.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019re both gazing intently at the tiny oak door, and after a moment an elderly couple in waterproof jackets joins us.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a wig cupboard,\u201d says Ed to the woman, whose face lights up with interest. \u201cThe wigmaster was compelled to live in the cupboard along with his wigs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d The elderly woman\u2019s face falls. \u201cHow terrible!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d says Ed gravely. \u201cBecause the wigmaster was very small.\u201d He starts to demonstrate with his hands. \u201cVery, very tiny. The word wig is derived from the phrase small man in a cupboard , you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d The poor woman looks bewildered, and I nudge Ed hard in the ribs.</p><p>\u201cHave a good tour,\u201d he says charmingly, and we move on.</p><p>\u201cYou have an evil streak!\u201d I say as soon as we\u2019re out of earshot. Ed thinks about this for a moment, then gives me a disarming grin.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe I do. When I\u2019m hungry. You want some lunch? Or should we see the Royal Fusiliers Museum?\u201d</p><p>I hesitate thoughtfully, as though weighing these two options. I mean, no one could be more interested in their heritage than me. But the thing with any sightseeing is, after a while it turns into sight-trudging, and all the heritage turns into a blur of winding stone steps and battlements and stories about severed heads stuffed on pikes.</p><p>\u201cWe could do lunch,\u201d I say casually. \u201cIf you\u2019ve had enough for now.\u201d</p><p>Ed\u2019s eyes glint. I have this disconcerting feeling he knows exactly what I\u2019m thinking.</p><p>\u201cI have a very short attention span,\u201d he says, deadpan. \u201cBeing American. So maybe we should eat.\u201d</p><p>We head to a caf\u00e9 serving things like \u201cGeorgian onion soup\u201d and \u201cwild boar casserole.\u201d Ed insists on paying since I bought the tickets, and we find a table in the corner by the window.</p><p>\u201cSo, what else do you want to see in London?\u201d I say enthusiastically. \u201cWhat else was on your list?\u201d</p><p>Ed flinches, and I suddenly wish I hadn\u2019t put it like that.

It\u2019s fine.\u201d He considers his forkful for a moment, as though debating whether to eat it. \u201cYou know what? You were right, what you said the other day. Shit happens, and you have to get on with life. I like your dad\u2019s thing about the escalator. I\u2019ve thought about that since we talked. Onward and upward.\u201d He puts the fork in his mouth.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I can\u2019t help feeling touched. I\u2019ll have to tell Dad.</p><p>\u201cMmm-hmm.\u201d He chews for a moment, then eyes me questioningly. \u201cSo... you said you had a breakup too. When was that?\u201d</p><p>Yesterday. Less than twenty-four hours ago. Even thinking about it makes me want to close my eyes and moan.</p><p>\u201cIt was... a while ago.\u201d I shrug. \u201cHe was called Josh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what happened? If you don\u2019t mind me asking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not. It was... I just realized... we weren\u2019t-\u201d I break off, with a heavy sigh, and look up. \u201cHave you ever felt really, really stupid?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNever.\u201d Ed shakes his head. \u201cAlthough I have on occasion felt really, really, really stupid.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help a little smile. Talking to Ed puts everything into perspective a bit. I\u2019m not the only person in the world to feel like a fool. And at least Josh didn\u2019t two-time me. At least I didn\u2019t end up marooned all alone in a strange city.</p><p>\u201cHey, let\u2019s do something that wasn\u2019t on your list,\u201d I say on impulse. \u201cLet\u2019s see some sight that was never in the plan. Is there anything?\u201d</p><p>Ed breaks off a piece of bread, mulling.</p> <p>\u201cCorinne didn\u2019t want to go on the London Eye,\u201d he says at last. \u201cShe\u2019s scared of heights and she thought it was kinda dumb.\u201d</p><p>I knew I didn\u2019t like this woman. How can anyone think the London Eye is dumb?</p><p>\u201cLondon Eye it is,\u201d I say firmly. \u201cAnd then maybe Ye Olde Starbucks? It\u2019s a traditional English custom, very quaint.\u201d</p><p>I wait for Ed to laugh, but he just gives me an appraising look as he eats his bread.</p><p>\u201cStarbucks. Interesting. You don\u2019t go to Lingtons Coffee?\u201d</p> <p>Oh, right. So he\u2019s worked it out.</p><p>\u201cSometimes. Depends.\u201d I shrug defensively. \u201cSo... you know I\u2019m related.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you, I asked around about you.\u201d</p><p>His face is impassive. He hasn\u2019t done what people usually do when they find out about Uncle Bill, which is say, \u201cOh, wow, that\u2019s amazing, what\u2019s he like in real life?\u201d</p><p>Ed\u2019s in big business, it occurs to me. He must have come across Uncle Bill in some way or another.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think of my uncle?\u201d I say lightly.</p> <p>\u201cLingtons Coffee is a successful organization,\u201d he replies. \u201cVery profitable. Very efficient.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s avoiding the question. \u201cWhat about Bill?\u201d I persist. \u201cHave you ever come across him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I have.\u201d He swallows his wine. \u201cAnd I think Two Little Coins is manipulative bullshit. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve never heard anyone be so rude about Uncle Bill, not to my face. It\u2019s kind of refreshing.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be sorry,\u201d I say at once. \u201cSay what you think. Tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I think is... your uncle is the one in the million. And I\u2019m sure a lot of different factors went into his success. But that\u2019s not the message he\u2019s selling. He\u2019s selling the message \u2018It\u2019s easy! Come be a millionaire like me!\u2019\u201d Ed sounds curt, almost angry. \u201cThe only people who go to those seminars will be self-deluding fantasists, and the only person who\u2019ll make any money is your uncle. He\u2019s exploiting a lot of sad, desperate people. Just an opinion.\u201d</p><p>The instant he says all this, I know it\u2019s true. I saw the people at the Two Little Coins seminar. Some of them had traveled miles. Some of them did look desperate. And it\u2019s not like the seminar cost nothing.</p><p>\u201cI went to one of his day seminars once,\u201d I admit. \u201cJust to see what it was all about.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, really. And did you instantly make your fortune?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I did! Didn\u2019t you spot my limo earlier?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that was yours. I assumed you\u2019d use your helicopter.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019re both grinning by now. I can\u2019t believe I called Ed Mr. American Frown. He doesn\u2019t frown that often. And when he does, he\u2019s usually thinking of something funny to say. He pours me some more wine and I lean back, relishing the view of the tower, and the warm glow that the wine is giving me, and the prospect of the rest of the day ahead.</p><p>\u201cSo, why do you carry cards with you?\u201d I say, deciding it\u2019s my turn to start. \u201cDo you play patience the whole time or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoker. If I can find anyone to play with. You\u2019d be great at poker,\u201d he adds.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be terrible!\u201d I contradict him. \u201cI\u2019m crap at gambling, and-\u201d I stop as Ed shakes his head.</p><p>\u201cPoker\u2019s not about gambling. It\u2019s about being able to read people. Your Eastern mind-reading powers would come in handy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right.\u201d I blush. \u201cWell... my powers seem to have abandoned me.\u201d</p><p>Ed raises an eyebrow. \u201cYou\u2019re not hustling me here, Miss Lington?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I laugh. \u201cThey really have! I\u2019m a total novice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK, then.\u201d He takes out the pack of cards and shuffles it expertly. \u201cAll you need to know is, do the other players have good cards or bad? Simple as that. So you look at your opponents\u2019 faces. And you ask yourself, Is something going on? And that\u2019s the game.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201c\u2018Is something going on?\u2019\u201d I repeat. \u201cAnd how can you tell?\u201d</p><p>Ed deals himself three cards and glances at them. Then he gazes at me. \u201cGood or bad?\u201d</p><p>Oh God. I have no idea. His face is dead straight. I survey his smooth forehead, the tiny lines around his eyes, the hint of weekend stubble-searching for clues. There\u2019s a glint in his eye, but that could mean anything.</p><p>\u201cDunno,\u201d I say helplessly. \u201cI\u2019ll go with... good?\u201d</p> <p>Ed looks amused. \u201cThose Eastern powers really did desert you. They\u2019re terrible.\u201d He shows me three low cards. \u201cNow your turn.\u201d He shuffles the pack again, deals out three cards and watches me pick them up.</p><p>I\u2019ve got the three of clubs, the four of hearts, and the ace of spades. I study them, then look up with my most inscrutable expression.</p><p>\u201cRelax,\u201d says Ed. \u201cDon\u2019t laugh.\u201d</p><p>Of course, now he\u2019s said that, I can feel my mouth twitching.</p><p>\u201cYou have a terrible poker face,\u201d says Ed. \u201cYou know that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re putting me off!\u201d I wriggle my mouth around a bit, getting rid of the laugh. \u201cOK, then, what have I got?\u201d</p><p>Ed\u2019s dark brown eyes lock on mine. We\u2019re both silent and still, gazing at each other. After a few seconds I feel a weird flip in my stomach. This feels... strange. Too intimate. Like he can see more of me than he should. Pretending to cough, I break the spell and turn away. I take a gulp of wine and look back to see Ed sipping his wine too.</p><p>\u201cYou have one high card, probably an ace,\u201d he says matter-of-factly. \u201cAnd two low ones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I put the cards down. \u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour eyes popped out of your face when you saw the ace.\u201d Ed sounds amused. \u201cIt was totally obvious. Like, \u2018Oh wow! A high one!\u2019 Then you looked right and left as though you might have given yourself away. Then you put your hand over the high one and gave me a dirty look.\u201d He\u2019s starting to laugh now. \u201cRemind me not to give you any state secrets to keep anytime soon.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t believe it. I thought I was being really inscrutable.</p> <p>\u201cBut, seriously.\u201d Ed begins shuffling the cards again. \u201cYour mind-reading trick. It\u2019s all based on analyzing behavioral traits, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr... that\u2019s right,\u201d I say cautiously.</p><p>\u201cThat can\u2019t have just deserted you. Either you know that stuff or you don\u2019t. So what\u2019s going on, Lara? What\u2019s the story?\u201d</p><p>He leans forward intently, as though waiting for an answer. I feel a bit thrown. I\u2019m not used to this kind of focused attention. If he were Josh, I\u2019d have been able to fob him off easily. Josh always took everything at face value. He\u2019d have said, \u201cRight, babe,\u201d and I could have moved the subject on quickly and he never would have questioned it or thought about it again...</p><p>Because Josh was never really that interested in me .</p><p>It hits me like a drench of cold water. A final, mortifying insight that instantly has the feel and ring of truth to it. All the time we were together, Josh never challenged me, never gave me a hard time, barely even remembered the fine details of my life. I thought he was just easygoing and laid-back. I loved him for it. I saw it as a plus. But now I understand better. The truth is, he was laid-back because he didn\u2019t really care. Not about me. Not enough, anyway.</p><p>I feel like I\u2019m finally stepping out of some trance. I was so busy chasing after him, so desperate, so sure of myself, I never looked closely enough at what I was chasing. I never stopped to ask if he really was the answer. I\u2019ve been such an idiot .</p><p>I look up to see Ed\u2019s dark, intelligent eyes still keenly scanning me. And in spite of myself I feel a sudden weird exhilaration that he, someone I barely know, wants to find out more about me. I can see it in his face: He\u2019s not asking for the sake of it. He genuinely wants to know the truth.</p> <p>Only I can\u2019t tell him. Obviously.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s... quite tricky to explain. Quite complicated.\u201d I drain my glass, stuff a last bite of cake into my mouth, and beam distractingly at Ed. \u201cCome on. Let\u2019s go to the London Eye.\u201d</p><p>As we arrive at the South Bank, it\u2019s buzzing with Sunday afternoon tourists, buskers, secondhand-book stalls, and lots of those living statues, which always slightly freak me out. The London Eye is creeping around like a massive Ferris wheel, and I can see people in each transparent pod, peering down at us. I\u2019m quite excited, actually. I\u2019ve only been in the London Eye once before, and that was at a work do with lots of obnoxious drunk people. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A jazz band is playing an old twenties tune to a crowd of onlookers, and as we pass I can\u2019t help meeting Ed\u2019s eye. He does a couple of Charleston steps and I twirl my beads at him.</p><p>\u201cVery good!\u201d says a bearded guy in a hat, approaching us with a bucket for donations. \u201cAre you interested in jazz?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKind of,\u201d I say as I root in my bag for some money.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re interested in the 1920s,\u201d says Ed firmly, and winks at me. \u201cOnly the twenties, right, Lara?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re holding an open-air jazz event in Jubilee Gardens next week,\u201d says the guy eagerly. \u201cYou want tickets? Ten percent off if you buy them now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d says Ed, after glancing at me. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>He hands the guy some money, takes two tickets, and we walk on.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d says Ed after a bit. \u201cWe could go to this jazz thing... together. If you wanted to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr... right. Cool. I\u2019d like that.\u201d</p> <p>He gives me one of the tickets, and a little awkwardly I put it in my bag. For a while I walk on silently, trying to work out what just happened. Is he asking me on a date? Or is this just an extension of the sightseeing? Or... what? What are we doing?</p><p>I reckon Ed must be thinking something along the same lines, because as we join the queue for the Eye, he suddenly looks at me with a kind of quizzical expression.</p><p>\u201cHey, Lara. Tell me something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr... OK.\u201d I\u2019m instantly nervous. He\u2019s going to ask about me being psychic again.</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you burst into that conference room?\u201d His forehead crinkles humorously. \u201cWhy did you ask me on a date?\u201d</p><p>A million times worse. What am I supposed to say?</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s... a good question. And... and I have one for you,\u201d I parry. \u201cWhy did you come? You could have turned me down!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Ed looks mystified. \u201cYou want to know the truth? It\u2019s almost a blur. I can\u2019t decipher my own thought processes. A strange girl arrives in the office. Next moment I\u2019m on a date with her.\u201d He turns to me with renewed focus. \u201cC\u2019mon. You must have had a reason. Had you seen me around the place or something?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s an edge of hope to his voice. Like he\u2019s hoping to hear something that will make his day better. I feel a sudden, horrible pang of guilt. He has no idea he\u2019s just being used.</p><p>\u201cIt was... a dare with a friend.\u201d I stare over his shoulder. \u201cI don\u2019t know why I did it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d His voice is as relaxed as before. \u201cSo I was a random dare. Doesn\u2019t sound so good to the grandkids. I\u2019ll tell them you were sent to me by aliens. Right after I tell them about the Duke of Marmaduke\u2019s wigs.\u201d</p><p>I know he\u2019s joking. I know this is all banter. But as I glance up I can see it in his face. I can see the warmth. He\u2019s falling for me. No, scratch that, he thinks he\u2019s falling for me. But it\u2019s all fake. It\u2019s all wrong. It\u2019s another puppet show. He\u2019s been manipulated by Sadie as much as Josh was. None of this is real, none of it means anything.</p><p>I feel suddenly, ridiculously upset. This is all Sadie\u2019s fault. She creates trouble wherever she goes. Ed is a really, really nice guy and he\u2019s been screwed up enough already, and she\u2019s messed with him and it\u2019s not fair.</p><p>\u201cEd.\u201d I swallow.</p> <p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>Oh God. What do I say? You haven\u2019t been dating me, you\u2019ve been dating a ghost, she\u2019s been influencing your mind, she\u2019s like LSD without the upside...</p><p>\u201cYou might think you like me. But... you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d He laughs. \u201cI really like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t.\u201d I\u2019m struggling here. \u201cYou\u2019re not thinking for yourself. I mean... this isn\u2019t real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFeels pretty real to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it does. But... you don\u2019t understand-\u201d I break off, feeling helpless. There\u2019s silence for a moment-then, Ed\u2019s face abruptly changes.</p><p>\u201cOh. I see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d I say doubtfully.</p><p>\u201cLara, you don\u2019t have to soften me with an excuse.\u201d His smile turns wry. \u201cIf you\u2019ve had enough, just say. I can cope with an afternoon on my own. It\u2019s been fun and I appreciate the time you\u2019ve taken, thanks very much-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I say in dismay. \u201cStop it! I\u2019m not trying to bail out! I\u2019m having a really good time today. And I want to go on the London Eye.\u201d</p><p>Ed\u2019s eyes scan my face, up and down, left and right, as though they\u2019re lie detectors. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell, so do I,\u201d he says at last.</p><p>\u201cWell... good.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019re so engrossed in our conversation, we haven\u2019t noticed the gap growing in the queue ahead of us.</p><p>\u201cGet on with it!\u201d A guy behind suddenly prods me. \u201cYou\u2019re on!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh!\u201d I wake up. \u201cQuick, we\u2019re on!\u201d I grab Ed\u2019s hand and we run forward toward the big oval pod. It\u2019s inching its way along the platform, and people are stepping on, amid giggles and shrieks. I step on, still hand in hand with Ed, and we beam at each other, all the awkwardness gone.</p><p>\u201cOK, Mr. Harrison.\u201d I revert to my tour-operator voice. \u201cNow you\u2019re going to see London.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s brilliant. I mean, it just is brilliant .</p><p>We\u2019ve been right up to the top and seen the whole city stretching out below us, like the A-Z map come to life. We\u2019ve peered down at the little people scurrying around like ants, getting into ant cars and ant buses. I\u2019ve knowledgeably pointed out St. Paul\u2019s, and Buckingham Palace, and Big Ben. Now I\u2019ve taken charge of the Historic London guidebook. It doesn\u2019t have a section on the London Eye, but I\u2019m reading out facts from it anyway, which I\u2019m making up.</p><p>\u201cThe pod is made of transparent titanium melted down from eyeglasses,\u201d I inform Ed. \u201cIf plunged underwater, each pod will automatically convert to a fully operational submarine.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI would expect no less.\u201d He nods, gazing out of the glass.</p><p>\u201cEach pod could survive underwater for thirteen hours...\u201d I trail off. I can tell he isn\u2019t really listening. \u201cEd?\u201d</p><p>He turns around to face me, his back against the glass wall of the pod. Behind him, the panoramic view of London is shifting slowly, infinitesimally upward. While we\u2019ve been up, the sunshine has disappeared, and solid gray clouds are gathering overhead.</p><p>\u201cYou want to know something, Lara?\u201d He glances around to check no one is listening, but everyone else in the pod has piled to the other side, watching a police boat on the Thames.</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d I say warily. \u201cNot if it\u2019s a really important secret and I\u2019m not supposed to give it away.\u201d</p><p>Ed\u2019s face flickers with a smile. \u201cYou asked me why I agreed to go on that first date with you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh. That. Well, it doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d I say hurriedly. \u201cDon\u2019t feel you have to tell me-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I want to tell you. It was... freaky.\u201d He pauses. \u201cI felt as though something inside my head was telling me to say yes. The more I resisted, the louder it shouted. Does that make any sense?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say hastily. \u201cNone. I\u2019ve no idea. Maybe it was... God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d He gives a short laugh. \u201cI could be the new Moses.\u201d He hesitates. \u201cPoint is, I\u2019ve never felt such a strong impulse, or voice, or whatever it was. Kinda blew me away.\u201d He takes a step forward, his voice lower. \u201cAnd whatever instinct it was-whatever deep place it came from-it was right. Spending time with you is the best thing I could have done. I feel like I\u2019ve woken up from a dream, or limbo... and I want to thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need!\u201d I say at once. \u201cIt was my pleasure. Anytime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so.\u201d His tone is oblique, and I feel a bit flustered under his gaze.</p><p>\u201cSo... um... you want to hear more from the guidebook?\u201d I riffle through the pages.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe pod is... um.\u201d I can\u2019t concentrate on what I\u2019m saying.</p><p>My heart has started beating more quickly. Everything seems heightened. I\u2019m aware of every movement I\u2019m making.</p><p>\u201cThe wheel travels... it goes around...\u201d I\u2019m making no sense. I close the book and meet Ed\u2019s gaze head-on, trying to match his deadpan expression, trying to appear as if nothing\u2019s concerning me at all.</p><p>Except quite a lot of things are concerning me. The heat rushing to my face. The hairs prickling at the back of my neck. The way Ed\u2019s eyes are boring into mine, like they want to get straight to the point. They\u2019re giving me twinges.</p><p>Truth is, he\u2019s giving me twinges all over the place.</p><p>I don\u2019t know how I ever thought he wasn\u2019t good-looking. I think I must have been a bit blind.</p><p>\u201cIs something going on?\u201d says Ed softly.</p><p>\u201cI... I don\u2019t know.\u201d I can barely speak. \u201cIs something going on?\u201d</p><p>He puts a hand up to my chin and cups it for a moment, as though surveying the terrain. Then he leans forward and pulls my face gently up to his with both hands and kisses me. His mouth is warm and sweet and his stubble is grazing my skin but he doesn\u2019t seem to care and... oh God. Yes, please . All my twinges have turned into singing, dancing urges. As he wraps his arms around me and pulls me tighter to him, two thoughts are jostling in my brain. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He\u2019s so different from Josh.</p><p>He\u2019s so good .</p><p>I\u2019m not having many other thoughts right now. At least you couldn\u2019t really call them thoughts so much as ravening desires.</p><p>At last Ed pulls away, his hands still cradling the back of my neck.</p> <p>\u201cYou know... that wasn\u2019t the plan for today,\u201d he says. \u201cJust in case you were wondering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t my plan either,\u201d I say breathlessly. \u201cNot at all.\u201d</p><p>He kisses me again, and I close my eyes, exploring his mouth with mine, inhaling the scent of him, wondering how much longer this London Eye ride has to go. As though reading my mind, Ed releases me.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should look at the view one more time,\u201d he says with a small laugh. \u201cBefore we land.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose we should.\u201d I give him a reluctant smile. \u201cWe\u2019ve paid for it, after all.\u201d</p> <p>Arm in arm, we turn to face the transparent wall of the pod. And I scream in fright.</p><p>Hovering outside the pod, looking in with searing, laserlike eyes, is Sadie.</p><p>She saw us. She saw us kissing.</p><p>Shit. Oh... shit. My heart is thumping like a rabbit\u2019s. As I quiver in terror, she advances through the transparent wall, her nostrils flared, her eyes flashing, making me back away on stumbling legs as if I really have seen a terrifying ghost.</p><p>\u201cLara?\u201d Ed is staring at me in shock. \u201cLara, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could you?\u201d Sadie\u2019s shriek of betrayal makes me clap my hands to my ears. \u201cHow could you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI... I didn\u2019t... it wasn\u2019t...\u201d I gulp, but the words won\u2019t come out properly. I want to tell her I didn\u2019t plan all this, that it\u2019s not as bad as she might think-</p><p>\u201cI saw you!\u201d</p><p>She gives a huge, racking sob, wheels around, and disappears.</p><p>\u201cSadie!\u201d I rush forward and clutch at the transparent wall of the pod, peering out, trying to glimpse her in the clouds or in the rushing water of the Thames or among the nearing crowds of people on the ground.</p><p>\u201cLara! Jesus! What happened?\u201d Ed looks totally freaked out. I suddenly notice that all the other people in the pod have stopped staring out at the view and are goggling at me.</p><p>\u201cNothing!\u201d I manage. \u201cSorry. I just... I was...\u201d As he puts his arm around me, I flinch. \u201cEd, I\u2019m sorry... I can\u2019t...\u201d</p><p>After a pause Ed takes his arm away. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019ve reached the ground now. Shooting anxious glances at me, Ed ushers me off the pod and onto solid ground.</p> <p>\u201cSo.\u201d His tone is cheerful, but I can tell he\u2019s perturbed. As well he might be. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t explain,\u201d I say miserably. I\u2019m desperately scanning the horizon, searching for any sight of Sadie.</p><p>\u201cWould a Ye Olde Starbucks help? Lara?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d I stop looking around and focus on Ed\u2019s concerned face. \u201cEd, I\u2019m so sorry. I can\u2019t do... this. It\u2019s been a lovely day, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut... it didn\u2019t go according to plan?\u201d he says slowly.</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s not that!\u201d I rub my face. \u201cIt\u2019s... it\u2019s complicated. I need to sort myself out.\u201d</p><p>I look up at him, willing him to understand. Or half understand. Or at least not think I\u2019m a flake.</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d He nods. \u201cI get it. Things aren\u2019t always clear-cut.\u201d He hesitates, then touches my arm briefly. \u201cLet\u2019s leave it here, then. It\u2019s been a great day. Thanks, Lara. You\u2019ve been very generous with your time.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s retreated into his formal gentlemanly style. All the warmth and joking between us has ebbed away. It\u2019s like we\u2019re two distant acquaintances. He\u2019s protecting himself, I suddenly realize with a pang. He\u2019s going back into his tunnel.</p><p>\u201cEd, I\u2019d love to see you again sometime,\u201d I say desperately. \u201cOnce things are... sorted out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like that.\u201d I can tell he doesn\u2019t believe me for a minute. \u201cLet me call you a taxi.\u201d As he looks up and down the road, I can see his frown returning, like little lines of disappointment.</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019ll just stay here a bit and wander about, get my head straight.\u201d I muster a smile. \u201cThanks. For everything.\u201d</p><p>He gives me a farewell wave, like a salute, then heads off into the crowd. I stare after him, feeling crushed. I like him. I really, really like him. And now he feels hurt. And so do I. And so does Sadie. What a mess.</p><p>\u201cSo this is what you do behind my back!\u201d Sadie\u2019s voice in my ear makes me jump and clasp my chest. Has she been waiting there all this time? \u201cYou lying snake. You backstabber. I came here to see how you were getting on with Josh.

I danced with him! He\u2019s mine! Mine! Mine!\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s so self-righteous, and so livid, and she\u2019s not even listening to what I\u2019m saying.

You\u2019re dead!

It\u2019s not like he\u2019ll ever meet you, is it? You\u2019re a ghost! A ghost !\u201d All my misery at the situation is bursting out in a vent of anger. \u201cTalk about self-deluded! Talk about not facing up to the truth, Sadie! You keep telling me to move on! How about you move on?\u201d</p> <p>Even as I\u2019m uttering the words, I\u2019m realizing how they sound, how they might be misinterpreted. And I\u2019m wishing beyond anything I could take them back. A tremor of shock passes across Sadie\u2019s face. She looks as though I\u2019ve slapped her.</p><p>She can\u2019t think I meant...</p><p>Oh God.</p><p>\u201cSadie, I wasn\u2019t... I didn\u2019t...\u201d My words are all jumbled up in my mouth. I don\u2019t even quite know what I want to say. Sadie looks hollow-eyed. She\u2019s gazing out at the river as though she\u2019s not even aware of me anymore.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d she says at last. All the spirit has gone out of her voice. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I\u2019m dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo you\u2019re not!\u201d I say in distress. \u201cI mean... OK, maybe you are. But-\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m dead. It\u2019s over. You don\u2019t want me. He doesn\u2019t want me. What\u2019s the point?\u201d</p><p>She starts walking away toward Waterloo Bridge and disappears from view. Racked with guilt, I hurry after her and up the steps. She\u2019s already halfway along the bridge, and I run to catch up. She\u2019s standing still, staring out toward St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral, a willowy figure in the grayness, and gives no sign of realizing I\u2019m there.</p><p>\u201cSadie, it\u2019s not over!\u201d My voice is almost lost in the wind. \u201cNothing\u2019s over! I wasn\u2019t thinking, I was just angry at you, I was talking rubbish-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You\u2019re right.\u201d She speaks fast, without turning her head. \u201cI\u2019m as self-deceiving as you. I thought I could have some last fun in this world. I thought I could have a friendship. Make a difference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have made a difference!\u201d I say in dismay. \u201cPlease don\u2019t talk like this. Look, come home, we\u2019ll put on some music, have a good time-\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t patronize me!\u201d She turns her head and I can see her trembling. \u201cI know what you really think. You don\u2019t care about me, no one cares about me, some meaningless old person-\u201d</p><p>\u201cSadie, stop it, that\u2019s not true-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard you at the funeral!\u201d Sadie suddenly erupts passionately, and I feel a cold horror. She heard us?</p> <p>\u201cI heard you at the funeral,\u201d she repeats, regaining her dignity. \u201cI heard all the family talking together. Nobody wanted to be there. Nobody mourned me. I was just a \u2018million-year-old nobody.\u2019\u201d</p><p>I feel queasy with shame as I remember what everyone said. We were so callous and horrible. All of us.</p><p>Sadie\u2019s chin is taut and she\u2019s gazing fixedly over my shoulder. \u201cYour cousin put it exactly right. I didn\u2019t achieve anything in my life, I left no mark, I wasn\u2019t anything special. I don\u2019t know why I bothered living, really!\u201d She gives a brittle laugh.</p><p>\u201cSadie... please don\u2019t.\u201d I swallow.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t have love,\u201d she continues, inexorably, \u201cor a career. I didn\u2019t leave behind children or achievements or anything to speak of. The only man I ever loved... forgot about me.\u201d There\u2019s a sudden shake in her voice. \u201cI lived for one hundred and five years, but I didn\u2019t leave a trace. Not one. I didn\u2019t mean anything to anybody. And I still don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you do. Of course you do,\u201d I say desperately. \u201cSadie, please-\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been a fool, clinging on.

I\u2019m almost crying myself. \u201cSadie, I care about you. And I\u2019m going to make it up to you.

Sa-die!\u201d I\u2019m peering desperately down at the murky, swirling water, tears streaming down my cheeks. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t for nothing! Sadie, please, can you hear me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God!\u201d A girl beside me in a checked coat gasps. \u201cSomeone\u2019s jumped in the river! Help!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, they haven\u2019t!\u201d I lift my head, but she\u2019s not listening; she\u2019s beckoning her friends. Before I can gather my wits, people are crowding around the parapet and gazing down at the water.</p><p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s jumped!\u201d I can hear people saying. \u201cCall the police!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, they haven\u2019t!\u201d I say, but I\u2019m drowned out. A boy in a denim jacket is already filming the water with his mobile phone. A man to my right is peeling off his jacket as though preparing to dive in, while his girlfriend watches admiringly.</p> <p>\u201cNo!\u201d I grab at his jacket. \u201cStop!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s got to do the right thing,\u201d says the man, in a hero-like voice, glancing at his girlfriend.</p><p>For God\u2019s sake.</p><p>\u201cNo one\u2019s jumped!\u201d I shout, waving my arms. \u201cThere\u2019s been a mistake! Everything\u2019s fine! No one\u2019s jumped; repeat, no one\u2019s jumped!\u201d</p><p>The man stops, halfway through taking off his shoes. The boy with the mobile phone swivels and starts filming me instead.</p><p>\u201cThen who were you talking to?\u201d The girl in the checked coat gives me an accusing look, as though suspecting me of lying. \u201cYou were shouting at the water and crying! You gave us all a fright! Who were you talking to?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI was talking to a ghost,\u201d I say shortly. I turn away before she can reply, and push my way through the crowd, ignoring the exclamations and grumbling comments.</p><p>She\u2019ll come back, I tell myself. When she\u2019s calmed down and forgiven me. She\u2019ll come back.</p><p>TWENTY</p><p>But next morning the flat is still and silent. Normally Sadie appears as I\u2019m making a cup of tea, perching on the work surface, making rude comments about my pajamas and telling me I don\u2019t know how to make tea properly.</p><p>Today there\u2019s nothing. I fish my tea bag out of my cup and look around the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cSadie? Sadie, are you there?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s no reply. The air feels dead and empty.</p><p>As I get ready for work, it\u2019s weirdly quiet without Sadie\u2019s constant babble. In the end I turn the radio on for company. And, on the plus side, at least there\u2019s no one bossing me around. At least I can do my makeup my way today. Defiantly, I put on a frilled top I know she hates. Then, feeling a bit bad, I add another coat of mascara. Just in case, somehow, she\u2019s watching.</p> <p>Before I leave, I can\u2019t help looking around one last time.</p><p>\u201cSadie? Are you there? I\u2019m going to work now, so if you want to talk or anything, just come to the office...\u201d</p><p>Holding my tea, I go around the whole flat, calling out, but there\u2019s no response. God knows where she is or what she\u2019s doing, or what she\u2019s feeling-I feel a fresh spasm of guilt as I remember her hollow face. If I\u2019d only known she heard us talking at the funeral-</p><p>Anyway. There\u2019s nothing I can do about it now. If she wants me, she knows where to find me.</p><p>I get to work just after nine-thirty to find Natalie already at her desk, flicking her hair back as she talks on the phone. \u201cYeah. That\u2019s what I said to him, babe.\u201d She winks at me and taps her watch. \u201cIn a bit late, aren\u2019t you Lara? Got into bad habits when I was away? Anyway, babe...\u201d She swivels back again.</p><p>Bad habits? Me?</p><p>I\u2019m instantly seething. Who does she think she is? She\u2019s the one who buggered off to India. She\u2019s the one who behaved un-professionally. And now she\u2019s treating me like the dim work-experience girl.</p><p>\u201cNatalie,\u201d I say as she puts the phone down. \u201cI need to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I need to talk to you.\u201d Natalie\u2019s eyes gleam at me. \u201cEd Harrison, eh?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I say, confused.</p><p>\u201cEd Harrison,\u201d she repeats impatiently. \u201cYou\u2019ve kept him a bit quiet, haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Faint alarm bells are ringing. \u201cHow do you know about Ed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBusiness People!\u201d Natalie turns a magazine toward me, open at the picture of Ed and me. \u201cGood-looking chap.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not... it\u2019s a business thing,\u201d I say hurriedly, looking up.</p><p>\u201cOh, I know, Kate told me. You\u2019re back with Josh, whatever...\u201d Natalie gives a mock-yawn to show just how interesting my love life is to her. \u201cThat\u2019s my point.

Do you have a plan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor placing him!\u201d Natalie leans forward and speaks with elaborate patience. \u201cWe\u2019re a headhunting firm, Lara. We place people in jobs. That\u2019s what we do . That\u2019s how we make money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d I try to hide my horror. \u201cNo. No. You don\u2019t understand. He\u2019s not that kind of contact. He doesn\u2019t want a new job.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe thinks he doesn\u2019t,\u201d Natalie corrects me.</p><p>\u201cNo, really, forget it.

Have we turned into the bloody Mother Teresa Agency? We need to earn commission , Lara. We need to make a profit .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I snap. \u201cThat\u2019s what I was doing while you were lying on the beach in Goa, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoh!\u201d Natalie tosses back her head and laughs. \u201cMiaou!\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s not remotely shamefaced. She hasn\u2019t once apologized, for anything. How could I have thought she was my best friend? I feel like I don\u2019t even know her.</p><p>\u201cJust leave Ed alone,\u201d I say fiercely. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want a new job. I\u2019m serious. He won\u2019t talk to you, anyway-\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe already did.\u201d She leans back, looking supremely pleased with herself.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI called him this morning.

I get the job done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he doesn\u2019t take calls from headhunters,\u201d I say, bewildered. \u201cHow did you-\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I didn\u2019t give my name at first,\u201d says Natalie gaily. \u201cJust said I was a friend of yours and you\u2019d asked me to call. We had quite a little chat, as it happens. He didn\u2019t seem to know anything about Josh, but I gave him the full picture.\u201d She raises her eyebrows. \u201cInteresting. Keeping the boyfriend from him for a reason, were you?\u201d</p><p>I feel a rising dismay.</p><p>\u201cWhat-what exactly did you say about Josh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoh, Lara!\u201d Natalie looks delighted at my discomfiture. \u201cWere you planning on a little intrigue with him? Have I ruined things for you?\u201d She puts a hand over her mouth. \u201cSorry!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d I yell, finally losing it. \u201cShut up!\u201d</p><p>I have to talk to Ed. Now. Grabbing my mobile, I hurry out of the office, bumping into Kate on the way. She\u2019s carrying a coffee tray and widens her eyes as she sees me.</p><p>\u201cLara! Are you OK?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNatalie,\u201d I say shortly, and she winces.</p><p>\u201cI think she\u2019s worse with a tan,\u201d she whispers, and I can\u2019t help a reluctant smile. \u201cAre you coming in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a minute. I have to make a call. It\u2019s kind of... private.\u201d I head down the stairs and out onto the street, speed-dialing Ed\u2019s number. God knows what Natalie said to him. God knows what he thinks of me now.</p><p>\u201cEd Harrison\u2019s office.\u201d A woman\u2019s voice answers.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d I try not to sound as apprehensive as I feel. \u201cIt\u2019s Lara Lington here. Could I possibly speak to Ed?\u201d</p><p>As I\u2019m put on hold, my mind can\u2019t help traveling back to yesterday. I can remember exactly how his arms felt around me. How his skin felt against mine. The smell of him, the taste of him... And then that awful way he retreated into his shell. It makes me flinch just remembering.</p><p>\u201cHi, Lara. What can I do for you?\u201d His voice comes on the line. Formal and businesslike. Not one shred of warmth. My heart sinks slightly, but I try to sound upbeat and pleasant. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cEd, I gather my colleague Natalie rang you this morning. I\u2019m so sorry. It won\u2019t happen again. And I also wanted to say...\u201d I hesitate awkwardly. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry about how yesterday ended.\u201d</p><p>And I don\u2019t have a boyfriend , I want to add. And I wish we could rewind and go up on the London Eye and you\u2019d kiss me again. And this time I wouldn\u2019t pull away, whatever happened, however many ghosts yelled at me .</p><p>\u201cLara, please don\u2019t apologize.\u201d Ed sounds remote. \u201cI should have realized you had more... commercial concerns, shall we say. That\u2019s why you were trying to let me down. I appreciate that little blast of honesty, at any rate.\u201d</p><p>I feel a sudden iciness in my spine. Is that what he thinks? That I was just after him for business?</p> <p>\u201cEd, no,\u201d I say quickly. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like that. I really enjoyed our day together. I know things went a bit weird, but there were... complicating factors. I can\u2019t explain-\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t patronize me,\u201d Ed interrupts evenly. \u201cYou and your colleague clearly cooked up a little plan. I don\u2019t particularly appreciate your methods, but I suppose you have to be applauded for perseverance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not true!\u201d I say in horror. \u201cEd, you can\u2019t believe anything Natalie says. You know she\u2019s unreliable. You can\u2019t believe we cooked up a plan, it\u2019s a ludicrous idea!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelieve me,\u201d he says shortly, \u201cafter the small amount of research I did on Natalie, I\u2019d believe her capable of any plan, however devious or dumb-assed. Whether you\u2019re simply nave or as bad as she is, I don\u2019t know-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got it all wrong!\u201d I say desperately.</p> <p>\u201cJesus, Lara!\u201d Ed sounds at the end of his tether. \u201cDon\u2019t push it. I know you have a boyfriend. I know you and Josh got back together, probably never even broke up. The whole thing was a sting, and don\u2019t fucking insult me by carrying on with the charade. I should\u2019ve realized the instant you showed up in my office. Maybe you did your research and found out about Corinne and me. Figured you could get to me that way. God knows what you people are capable of. Nothing would surprise me.\u201d</p><p>His voice is so harsh, so hostile, I flinch.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t do that! I would never do that, never!\u201d My voice trembles. \u201cEd, what we had was real. We danced... we had such fun... You can\u2019t think it was all fake-\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you don\u2019t have a boyfriend, I suppose.\u201d He sounds like a barrister in court.</p><p>\u201cNo! Of course not-I mean yes,\u201d I correct myself. \u201cI did, but I split up with him on Friday-\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn Friday!\u201d Ed gives a humorless laugh which makes me wince. \u201cHow convenient. Lara, I don\u2019t have time for this.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEd, please.\u201d My eyes are welling up. \u201cYou have to believe me-\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye, Lara.\u201d</p><p>The phone goes dead. I stand for a moment, motionless, little darts of pain shooting around my body. There\u2019s no point calling back. There\u2019s no point trying to explain. He\u2019ll never believe me. He thinks I\u2019m a cynical user-or, at best, nave and weak. And there\u2019s nothing I can do.</p><p>No. I\u2019m wrong. There is something I can do.</p><p>I fiercely brush at my eyes and turn on my heel. As I arrive upstairs, Natalie\u2019s on the phone, filing her nails and uproariously laughing at something. Without pausing, I head for her desk, reach over and cut the line.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d Natalie spins around. \u201cI was on the phone!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, now you\u2019re not,\u201d I say evenly. \u201cAnd you\u2019re going to listen to me. I\u2019ve had enough. You can\u2019t behave like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She laughs.</p> <p>\u201cYou swan off to Goa. You expect us to pick up the pieces. It\u2019s arrogant and unfair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHear, hear!\u201d chimes in Kate, then claps a hand to her mouth as we both swivel to look at her.</p><p>\u201cThen you come back and take credit for a client who I found! Well, I\u2019m not going to put up with it! I\u2019m not going to be used anymore! In fact... I can\u2019t work with you anymore!\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t actually planning to say that last bit. But now I\u2019ve said it, I realize I mean it. I can\u2019t work with her. I can\u2019t even spend time with her. She\u2019s toxic.</p><p>\u201cLara. Babe. You\u2019re stressed out.\u201d Natalie rolls her eyes humorously. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you take the day off-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need the day off!\u201d I explode. \u201cI need you to be honest! You lied about being fired from your last job!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was not fired.\u201d An ugly scowl appears on Natalie\u2019s face. \u201cIt was a mutual decision. They were total assholes, anyway; they never appreciated me properly-\u201d She suddenly seems to realize how she\u2019s sounding. \u201cLara, come on. You and me, we\u2019re going to make a great team.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re not!\u201d I shake my head. \u201cNatalie, I don\u2019t think like you!

What will I tell Mum and Dad?</p> <p>No. Don\u2019t think about that now.</p><p>My throat is tight as I pick up a cardboard box from the corner, empty the computer paper out of it, and start packing my stuff. My hole punch. My pen holder.</p><p>\u201cBut if you think you can set up on your own and do what I do, you\u2019re wrong.\u201d Natalie suddenly lashes out, swiveling on her chair. \u201cYou don\u2019t have any contacts. You don\u2019t have any expertise. All your airy-fairy \u2018I want to give people great jobs\u2019 and \u2018Look at the whole picture.\u2019 That\u2019s not going to run a business.

I do?</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d says Natalie scathingly.</p><p>\u201cLike mind reading!\u201d Kate brandishes Business People . \u201cLara, you\u2019ve kept so quiet about this! There\u2019s a whole piece about you at the back on the gossip page! Lara Lington entertained crowds for an hour with her spectacular mind-reading feats. Organizers have been inundated with requests for Ms. Lington to entertain at corporate events. \u2018I\u2019ve never seen anything like it,\u2019 said John Crawley, chairman of Medway plc. \u2018Lara Lington should have her own TV show.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cMind reading?\u201d Natalie looks gobsmacked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s... something I\u2019ve been working on.\u201d I shrug.</p> <p>\u201cIt says here you read five minds at once!\u201d Kate is bubbling over. \u201cLara, you should go on Britain\u2019s Got Talent! You\u2019ve got a real gift!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince when could you mind read?\u201d Natalie\u2019s eyes narrow suspiciously.</p><p>\u201cThat would be telling. And, yes, maybe I will do a few corporate events,\u201d I add defiantly. \u201cStart a little business up.

I already have an assistant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, really?\u201d Kate\u2019s eager face deflates. \u201cBut they didn\u2019t mention any assistant in the article.

She didn\u2019t really want to be seen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s... a relation,\u201d I say at last.</p><p>Kate\u2019s face falls still further. \u201cOh, right. Well, I suppose you probably work well together if you\u2019re related.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got to understand each other pretty well.\u201d I nod, biting my lip. \u201cI mean, we\u2019ve had a zillion arguments along the way.

Maybe we were friends. I don\u2019t know what we are now. And all of a sudden I feel heavy despair. Look at me. I\u2019ve messed everything up with Sadie, with Ed, with Josh, I don\u2019t have a business anymore, my parents are going to freak out, I\u2019ve spent all my spare money on bloody flapper dresses-</p><p>\u201cWell, if she ever doesn\u2019t want to do it anymore...\u201d Kate\u2019s face brightens. \u201cOr if she wants an assistant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what our plans are. I just... it\u2019s all been a bit...\u201d I feel my eyes sting.

I haven\u2019t seen her or heard from her since.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re joking!\u201d says Kate in dismay. \u201cWhat was the row about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLots of things,\u201d I say miserably. \u201cI suppose mostly about... a man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd do you know if she\u2019s...\u201d Kate hesitates. \u201cI mean... is she OK?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s happened to her. She could be anywhere. I mean, normally we\u2019re talking to each other all day long.

I\u2019ve been to every vintage shop I can think of and hissed \u201cSadie?\u201d through the racks of clothes. I\u2019ve knocked on the doors of all the flats in this building and called out \u201cI\u2019m looking for my friend Sadie!\u201d loud enough for her to hear. I\u2019ve been to the Flashlight Dance Club and peered among the dancers on the dance floor. But there was no sight of her.</p><p>Yesterday I went to Edna\u2019s house and made up a story about my cat being lost, which resulted in both of us going around the house, calling, \u201cSadie? Puss puss puss?\u201d But there was no answer. Edna was very sweet, and she\u2019s promised to get in touch if she sees a stray tabby around the place. But that doesn\u2019t exactly help me.</p><p>Looking for lost ghosts is a total pain, it turns out. No one can see them. No one can hear them. You can\u2019t pin a photo to a tree with Missing: Ghost . You can\u2019t ask anyone, \u201cHave you seen my friend the ghost, looks like a flapper, shrieky voice, ring any bells?\u201d</p><p>Now I\u2019m standing in the British Film Institute. There\u2019s an old black-and-white movie playing and I\u2019m at the back, scanning the dark rows of heads. But it\u2019s no good. How am I supposed to see anything in this pitch blackness?</p><p>I start creeping down the aisle, crouching down, looking right and left along the dimly lit profiles.</p><p>\u201cSadie?\u201d I hiss, as discreetly as I can.</p><p>\u201cShh!\u201d says someone.</p> <p>\u201cSadie, are you there?\u201d I whisper as I reach the next row. \u201cSadie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d</p><p>Oh God. This will never work. There\u2019s only one thing for it. Plucking up all my courage, I stand up straight, take a deep breath, and call out at the top of my voice.</p><p>\u201cSadie! It\u2019s Lara here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShhhh!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re here, please let me know! I know you\u2019re upset and I\u2019m sorry and I want to be friends and-\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up! Who is that? Be quiet!\u201d There\u2019s a wave of head-turning and angry exclamations along the rows. But no answering call from Sadie.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d An usher has come up. \u201cI\u2019m going to have to ask you to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ll go.\u201d I follow the usher back up the aisle toward the exit, then suddenly turn around for one last shot. \u201cSadie? Sa-die!\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease be quiet!\u201d exclaims the usher furiously. \u201cThis is a cinema!\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m desperately peering into the blackness, but there\u2019s no sight of her pale skinny arms, no beads clicking, no feathers bobbing among the heads. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The usher escorts me right out of the BFI, issuing me with stern warnings and lectures all the way, then leaves me alone on the sidewalk, feeling like a dog who\u2019s been kicked out of a house.</p><p>Deflated, I start trudging along, shrugging my jacket on. I\u2019ll have a coffee and regroup. Although, to be honest, I\u2019m nearly out of ideas. As I head toward the river, there\u2019s the London Eye, towering into the sky, still making its way around jauntily, like nothing ever happened. Glumly, I turn my head away. I don\u2019t want to see the London Eye. I don\u2019t want to be reminded of that day. Trust me to have a painful, embarrassing moment on the most prominent sight in London. Why couldn\u2019t I have chosen a small out-of-the-way spot which I could then avoid?</p><p>I head into a caf\u00e9, order a double-strength cappuccino, and slump into a chair. It\u2019s starting to get me down, all this searching. The adrenaline that powered me to begin with is fading away. What if I never find her?</p><p>But I can\u2019t let myself think like that. I have to keep going. Partly because I refuse to admit defeat. Partly because the longer Sadie\u2019s gone, the more worried I am about her. And partly because, if I\u2019m honest, I\u2019m clinging on to this. While I\u2019m searching for Sadie, it feels as if the rest of my life is on hold. I don\u2019t have to think about the where-does-my-career-go-now thing. Or the what-do-I-tell-my-parents thing. Or the how-could-I-have-been-so-stupid-about-Josh thing.</p> <p>Or even the Ed thing. Which still upsets me whenever I let myself think about it. So... I just won\u2019t. I\u2019ll focus on Sadie, my Holy Grail. I know it\u2019s ridiculous, but I feel like if I can just track her down, everything else might fall into place.</p><p>Briskly, I unfold my list of Find Sadie ideas, but most of them are crossed out. The cinema was the most promising. The only other entries are Try other dancing clubs? and Nursing home?</p><p>I consider the nursing home for a moment as I sip my coffee. Sadie wouldn\u2019t go back there, surely. She hated it. She couldn\u2019t even face going in. Why would she be there now?</p><p>But it\u2019s worth a try.</p><p>I almost put on a disguise before I arrive at the Fairside Home, I\u2019m so nervous. I mean, here I am, the girl who accused the staff of murder, pitching up on the doorstep.</p> <p>Did they know it was me? I keep wondering in trepidation. Did the police tell them, \u201cIt was Lara Lington who besmirched your good name\u201d? Because, if so, I\u2019m dead meat. They\u2019ll surround me in a nurse mob and kick me with their white clumpy shoes. The old people will bash me with their walkers. And I\u2019ll deserve it.</p><p>But as Ginny opens the door, she shows no sign of knowing I\u2019m the false-accusation-maker. Her face creases into a warm smile, and of course I feel guiltier than ever.</p><p>\u201cLara! What a surprise! Can I help you with that?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m slightly laden down with cardboard cartons and a massive flower arrangement, which is starting to slip out of my arms.</p><p>\u201cOh, thanks,\u201d I say gratefully, handing her one. \u201cIt\u2019s got boxes of chocolate in it for you all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodness!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd these flowers are for the staff too...\u201d I follow her into the beeswax-scented hall and put the arrangement on the table. \u201cI wanted to say thank you to everyone for looking after my great-aunt Sadie so well.\u201d</p><p>And not murdering her. The thought never crossed my mind .</p><p>\u201cHow lovely! Everybody will be very touched!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d I say awkwardly. \u201cOn behalf of the family, we\u2019re all very grateful and feel bad that we didn\u2019t visit my great-aunt... more often.\u201d</p><p>Ever .</p><p>As Ginny unpacks the chocolates, exclaiming in delight, I surreptitiously sidle toward the stairs and look up them.</p><p>\u201cSadie?\u201d I hiss under my breath. \u201cAre you here?\u201d I scan the upstairs landing, but there\u2019s no sign.</p><p>\u201cAnd what\u2019s this?\u201d Ginny is looking at the other cardboard carton. \u201cMore chocolates?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. Actually that\u2019s some CDs and DVDs. For the other residents.\u201d</p><p>I open it and pull out the CDs. Charleston Tunes. The Best of Fred Astaire. 1920s-1940s-The Collection .</p><p>\u201cI just thought sometimes they might like to listen to the tunes they danced to when they were young,\u201d I say tentatively. \u201cEspecially the really old residents? It might cheer them up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLara, how incredibly thoughtful! We\u2019ll put one on straightaway!\u201d She heads into the dayroom, which is full of elderly people sitting in chairs and on sofas, with a daytime talk show blaring out of the television. I follow, looking all around the white heads for any sign of Sadie.</p><p>\u201cSadie?\u201d I hiss, looking around. \u201cSadie, are you here?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There\u2019s no reply. I should have known this was a ridiculous idea. I should leave.</p><p>\u201cThere we are!\u201d Ginny straightens up from the CD player. \u201cIt should come on in a minute.\u201d She zaps the TV off and we both stand motionless, waiting for the music. And then it starts. A scratchy 1920s recording of a jaunty, jazzy tune. It\u2019s a bit faint, and after a moment Ginny increases the volume to full blast.</p><p>On the other side of the room, an old man sitting under a tartan blanket with a tank of oxygen next to him turns his head. I can see the light of recognition coming on in faces around the room. Somebody starts humming along in a quavery voice. One woman even begins tapping her hand, her whole self lit up with pleasure.</p><p>\u201cThey love it!\u201d says Ginny to me. \u201cWhat a good idea! Shame we\u2019ve never thought of it before!\u201d</p> <p>I feel a sudden lump in my throat as I watch. They\u2019re all Sadie inside, aren\u2019t they? They\u2019re all in their twenties inside. All that white hair and wrinkled skin is just cladding. The old man with the oxygen tank was probably once a dashing heartthrob. That woman with distant rheumy eyes was once a mischievous young girl who played pranks on her friends. They were all young, with love affairs and friends and parties and an endless life ahead of them...</p><p>And as I\u2019m standing there, the weirdest thing happens. It\u2019s as if I can see them, the way they were. I can see their young, vibrant selves, rising up out of their bodies, shaking off the oldness, starting to dance with each other to the music. They\u2019re all dancing the Charleston, kicking up their heels skittishly, their hair dark and strong, their limbs lithe again, and they\u2019re laughing, clutching each other\u2019s hands, throwing back their heads, reveling in it-</p><p>I blink. The vision has gone. I\u2019m looking at a room full of motionless old people.</p><p>I glance sharply at Ginny. But she\u2019s just standing there, smiling pleasantly and humming along to the CD, out of tune.</p><p>The music is still playing away, echoing through the rest of the home. Sadie can\u2019t be here. She would have heard the music and come to see what was going on. The trail\u2019s gone cold yet again.</p> <p>\u201cI know what I meant to ask you!\u201d Ginny suddenly turns to me. \u201cDid you ever find that necklace of Sadie\u2019s? The one you were looking for?\u201d</p><p>The necklace. Somehow, with Sadie gone, that all seems a million miles away now.</p><p>\u201cNo, I never did.\u201d I try to smile. \u201cThis girl in Paris was supposed to be sending it to me, but... I\u2019m still hoping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh well, fingers crossed!\u201d says Ginny.</p><p>\u201cFingers crossed.\u201d I nod. \u201cAnyway, I\u2019d better go. I just wanted to say hi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s lovely to see you. I\u2019ll show you out.\u201d</p> <p>As we make our way through the hall, my head is still full of the vision I saw of all the old people dancing, young and happy again. I can\u2019t shake it.</p><p>\u201cGinny,\u201d I say on impulse as she opens the big front door. \u201cYou must have seen a lot of old people... passing on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I have,\u201d she says, matter-of-factly. \u201cThat\u2019s the peril of the job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you believe in...\u201d I cough, feeling embarrassed. \u201cIn the afterlife? Do you believe in spirits coming back and that kind of thing?\u201d</p><p>My mobile phone rings shrilly in my pocket before Ginny can answer, and she nods at it.</p><p>\u201cPlease, do get that.\u201d</p><p>I haul it out-and see Dad\u2019s number on the ID display.</p><p>Oh God. Why is Dad calling? He\u2019ll have heard about me leaving my job somehow. He\u2019ll be all stressy and asking what my plans are. And I can\u2019t even dodge the call, with Ginny watching.</p> <p>\u201cHi, Dad,\u201d I say hurriedly. \u201cI\u2019m just in the middle of something, can I put you on hold a minute?\u201d I jab at the phone and look up at Ginny again.</p><p>\u201cSo what you\u2019re asking is, do I believe in ghosts?\u201d she says with a smile.</p><p>\u201cEr... yes. I suppose I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruthfully? No, I don\u2019t. I think it\u2019s all in the head, Lara. I think it\u2019s what people want to believe. But I can understand what a comfort it must be to those who have lost loved ones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d I nod, digesting this. \u201cWell... bye. And thanks.\u201d</p><p>The door closes and I\u2019m halfway down the path before I remember Dad, still waiting patiently on the line. I grab my phone and press Talk.</p><p>\u201cHey, Dad! Sorry about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all, darling! I\u2019m sorry to disturb you at work.\u201d</p><p>Work? So he doesn\u2019t know.</p><p>\u201cOh, right!\u201d I say quickly, crossing my fingers. \u201cWork. Yes. Absolutely. Work! Where else would I be?\u201d I give a shrill laugh. \u201cAlthough, as it happens, I\u2019m not in the office right now...\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAh. Well, this may be ideal timing, then.\u201d Dad hesitates. \u201cI know this may sound odd. But I\u2019ve got something I need to talk to you about and it\u2019s rather important. Could we meet?\u201d</p><p>TWENTY-TWO</p><p>This is weird. I\u2019m really not sure what\u2019s going on.</p><p>We\u2019ve agreed to meet at Lingtons in Oxford Street, because it\u2019s central and we both know it. And also because whenever we arrange to meet up, Dad suggests Lingtons. He\u2019s unfailingly loyal to Uncle Bill, plus he has a Lingtons Gold VIP Card, which gets you free coffee and food, anywhere, anytime. (I don\u2019t. I only have Friends and Family, fifty percent off. Not that I\u2019m complaining.)</p> <p>As I arrive at the familiar chocolate-brown-and-white frontage, I\u2019m quite apprehensive. Maybe Dad\u2019s got some really bad news to break. Like Mum\u2019s ill. Or he\u2019s ill.</p><p>And even if he hasn\u2019t, what am I going to say about my bust-up with Natalie? How will he react when he realizes his flake of a daughter has invested loads of money in a business only to walk out on it? Just the thought of seeing his face crumple in disappointment-yet again-makes me wince. He\u2019ll be devastated. I can\u2019t tell him. Not yet. Not until I have a plan of action.</p><p>I push open the door and inhale the familiar scent of coffee, cinnamon, and baking croissants. The plushy brown velvet chairs and gleaming wooden tables are the same as in every other Lingtons around the world. Uncle Bill is beaming down from a massive poster behind the counter. Lingtons mugs, coffeepots, and grinders are arranged on a display shelf, all in the trademark chocolate brown and white. (No one else is allowed to use that shade of chocolate brown, apparently. It belongs to Uncle Bill.)</p><p>\u201cLara!\u201d Dad waves from the head of the queue. \u201cJust in time! What do you want?\u201d</p><p>Oh. He looks quite cheerful. Maybe he\u2019s not ill.</p> <p>\u201cHi.\u201d I give him a hug. \u201cI\u2019ll have a caramel Lingtoncino and a tuna melt.\u201d</p><p>You can\u2019t ask for a cappuccino in Lingtons. It has to be a Lingtoncino.</p><p>Dad orders the coffees and food, then proffers his Gold VIP Card.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d says the guy behind the till, looking dubious. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen one of these before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry scanning it,\u201d says Dad politely.</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d The guy\u2019s eyes widen as something bleeps on the till screen. He looks up at Dad, a bit awestruck. \u201cThat\u2019ll be... free.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI always feel a bit guilty using that card,\u201d confesses Dad, as we collect our coffees and make our way to a table. \u201cI\u2019m doing poor Bill out of his rightful income.\u201d</p><p>Poor Bill? I feel a tiny wrench in my heart. Dad is so good. He thinks about everyone except himself.</p><p>\u201cI think he can probably afford it.\u201d I glance wryly at Uncle Bill\u2019s face printed on my coffee mug.</p><p>\u201cProbably.\u201d Dad smiles and glances at my jeans. \u201cYou\u2019re dressed very casually, Lara! Is this the new dress-down approach at your office?\u201d</p><p>Shit. I never even thought about what I was wearing.</p><p>\u201cActually... I\u2019ve been at a seminar,\u201d I hurriedly improvise.</p><p>\u201cThey requested casual clothes. It was role play, that kind of thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWonderful!\u201d says Dad, so encouragingly that my cheeks flame with guilt. He unwraps a sugar and pours it into his coffee, then stirs it.</p> <p>\u201cLara. I want to ask you a question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d I nod earnestly.</p><p>\u201cHow is your business going? Really?\u201d</p><p>Oh God. Of all the zillions of questions he could have asked.</p><p>\u201cWell... you know. It\u2019s... it\u2019s good.\u201d My voice has shot up two notches. \u201cAll good! We\u2019ve got some great clients, and we\u2019ve recently done some work with Macrosant, and Natalie\u2019s back now-\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack?\u201d echoes Dad with interest. \u201cHas she been away?\u201d</p><p>The thing about lying to your parents is, you have to keep track of which lies you\u2019ve told.</p><p>\u201cShe popped away for a little bit.\u201d I force myself to smile. \u201cNo big deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you feel you made the right decision?\u201d Dad looks as if this really matters to him. \u201cYou\u2019re enjoying it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say miserably. \u201cI\u2019m enjoying it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou feel the business has a good future?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Really good.\u201d I stare at the table. The thing about lying to your parents is, sometimes you really wish you hadn\u2019t. Sometimes you just want to dissolve into tears and wail, \u201cDad, it\u2019s all gone wrooooong! What shall I doooooo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo... what did you want to talk to me about?\u201d I say, to get off the subject. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo matter.\u201d Dad gives me an affectionate look. \u201cYou\u2019ve answered my question already.

Dad shakes his head, smiling.</p><p>\u201cThere was an opportunity I wanted to talk to you about. But I don\u2019t want to disrupt your new business. I don\u2019t want to throw a spanner in the works. You\u2019re doing what you love and doing it well. You don\u2019t need a job offer.\u201d</p><p>Job offer?</p> <p>My heart is suddenly beating fast. But I mustn\u2019t give away my excitement.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell me about it, anyway?\u201d I try to sound casual. \u201cJust in case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarling.\u201d Dad laughs. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be polite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not being polite,\u201d I say quickly. \u201cI want to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t insult you. Darling, I\u2019m so proud of what you\u2019ve achieved,\u201d says Dad lovingly. \u201cThis would mean you\u2019d have to give it all up. It wouldn\u2019t be worth it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe it would! Just tell me!\u201d Shit. I sound too desperate. I quickly adjust my expression to one of mild interest. \u201cI mean, why not just fill me in? It can\u2019t do any harm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell. Maybe you\u2019re right.\u201d Dad takes a sip of coffee, then looks at me directly. \u201cBill called me yesterday. Quite a surprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUncle Bill?\u201d I say, taken aback.</p><p>\u201cHe said you\u2019d been to see him at his house recently?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I clear my throat. \u201cYes, I did pop round for a chat. I was going to tell you...\u201d</p><p>Not .</p> <p>\u201cWell, he was impressed. What did he describe you as, now?\u201d Dad gives that crooked little smile he gets when he\u2019s amused. \u201cOh, yes; \u2018tenacious.\u2019 Anyway, the upshot is... this.\u201d</p><p>He takes an envelope out of his pocket and slides it across the table. Disbelievingly, I open it. It\u2019s a letter on Lingtons headed paper. It\u2019s offering me a full-time job in the Lingtons human-resources department. It\u2019s offering me a salary of six figures.</p><p>I feel a bit faint. I look up, to see Dad\u2019s face glowing. Despite his cool demeanor, he\u2019s obviously really chuffed.</p><p>\u201cBill read it out over the phone before he biked it over. Quite something, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d I rub my brow, feeling confused. \u201cWhy did he send the letter to you? Why not straight to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBill thought it would be a nice touch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmile, darling!\u201d Dad laughs. \u201cWhether you take it up or not, it\u2019s a huge compliment!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRight,\u201d I say again. But I can\u2019t smile. Something\u2019s wrong.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful tribute to you,\u201d Dad is saying. \u201cI mean, Bill doesn\u2019t owe us anything. He\u2019s done this purely through appreciation of your talent and the goodness of his heart.\u201d</p><p>OK, that\u2019s what\u2019s wrong: Dad\u2019s nailed it. I don\u2019t believe in Uncle Bill\u2019s appreciation of my talent. Nor in the goodness of his heart.</p><p>I drop my gaze down to the letter again, to the six-figure sum printed in black and white. Suspicions are creeping over me like spiders.</p><p>He\u2019s trying to buy me off.</p><p>OK, maybe that\u2019s putting it too strongly. But he\u2019s trying to get me on side. I\u2019ve got under Uncle Bill\u2019s skin. Ever since I mentioned Sadie\u2019s necklace. I saw it in his eyes instantly: A shock. A wariness.</p><p>And now, out of the blue, a job offer.</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t want this to sway you,\u201d Dad is saying. \u201cMum and I are both so proud of you, Lara, and if you want to carry on with your business, we\u2019ll be one hundred percent behind you. The choice is absolutely up to you. No pressure either way.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s saying all the right things. But I can see the hope flickering in Dad\u2019s eyes, even if he\u2019s trying to hide it. He\u2019d love me to have a stable job at a massive multinational firm. And not just any massive multinational firm, the family massive multinational firm.</p><p>And Uncle Bill knows that. Why else has he sent this letter via Dad? He\u2019s trying to manipulate both of us.</p><p>\u201cI think Uncle Bill feels rather bad that he turned you down flat at the funeral,\u201d Dad continues. \u201cHe was very impressed at your persistence. And so am I! I had no idea you were planning to go and ask him again!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I didn\u2019t even mention a job! I went to ask him about-\u201d I stop hopelessly. I can\u2019t mention the necklace. I can\u2019t mention Sadie. This is all impossible. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTo be honest...\u201d Dad lowers his voice, leaning across the little table. \u201cI think Bill\u2019s been having a few problems with Diamant\u00e9. He regrets having brought her up so... lavishly. We had quite a heart-to-heart, and do you know what he said?\u201d Dad\u2019s face suffuses with pleasure. \u201cHe said he sees you as the kind of self-starting young person who should be a role model for Diamant\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t really think that! I want to cry out. You don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on! He just wants me to stop chasing the necklace!</p><p>I bury my head in my hands despairingly. It\u2019s such a preposterous story. It all sounds so unlikely. And now the necklace is gone and Sadie\u2019s gone and I don\u2019t know what to think... or do...</p><p>\u201cLara!\u201d exclaims Dad. \u201cDarling! Are you all right?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m... fine.\u201d I raise my head. \u201cSorry. It\u2019s all just a bit... overwhelming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is my fault,\u201d says Dad, his smile fading. \u201cI\u2019ve thrown you. I should never have mentioned it, your business is doing so well-\u201d</p><p>Oh God. I can\u2019t let this charade go on any longer.</p><p>\u201cDad.\u201d I cut him off. \u201cThe business isn\u2019t going well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not doing at all well. I lied. I didn\u2019t want to tell you.\u201d I\u2019m crushing a sugar wrapper between my fingers, unable to meet his eye. \u201cBut the truth is... it\u2019s a disaster. Natalie left me in the lurch and we had a big row and I walked out on her. And... and I\u2019ve split up with Josh again. For good.\u201d I swallow, forcing myself to say it. \u201cI\u2019ve finally realized how wrong I got everything with him. He didn\u2019t love me. I just really, really wanted him to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Dad sounds a bit shocked. \u201cGoodness.\u201d There\u2019s silence as he takes this all in. \u201cWell... perhaps this offer has come at just the right time,\u201d he says at last.</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d I mumble, still staring at the table.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d asks Dad gently. \u201cDarling, why are you resisting this? You wanted to work for Uncle Bill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But it\u2019s... complicated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLara, can I give you a piece of advice?\u201d Dad waits until I look up. \u201cDon\u2019t be so hard on yourself. Relax. Maybe it\u2019s not as complicated as you think.\u201d</p> <p>I look at Dad, at his straight face, his honest eyes. If I told him the truth, he wouldn\u2019t believe any of it. He\u2019d think I\u2019m a paranoid delusional or taking drugs. Or both.</p><p>\u201cDid Uncle Bill mention a necklace at all?\u201d I can\u2019t help saying.</p><p>\u201cA necklace?\u201d Dad looks puzzled. \u201cNo. What necklace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI... it\u2019s nothing.\u201d I sigh. I take a sip of Lingtoncino and look up to see that Dad is watching me. He smiles, but I can tell he\u2019s troubled.</p><p>\u201cDarling, you have a wonderful opportunity here.\u201d He gestures at the letter. \u201cA chance for you to get your life back on track. Maybe you should just take it. Don\u2019t overthink it. Don\u2019t look for problems that don\u2019t exist. Just take your chance.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t understand. How could he? Sadie isn\u2019t a problem that doesn\u2019t exist. She does exist. She\u2019s real. She\u2019s a person, and she\u2019s my friend, and she needs me-</p><p>Then where is she? says a sharp voice in my head, like a knife thumping into a block. If she exists, where is she?</p><p>I start in shock. Where did that voice come from? I can\u2019t be doubting-I can\u2019t be thinking-</p> <p>I feel a sudden feathery panic. Of course Sadie\u2019s real. Of course she is. Don\u2019t be ridiculous. Stop thinking like this.</p><p>But now Ginny\u2019s voice is running through my head again. I think it\u2019s all in the head, Lara. It\u2019s what people want to believe .</p><p>No. No way. I mean ... No .</p><p>Feeling giddy, I take a gulp of Lingtoncino and look around the coffee shop, trying to anchor myself to reality. Lingtons is real. Dad is real. The job offer is real. And Sadie is real. I know she is. I mean, I saw her. I heard her. We talked together. We danced together, for God\u2019s sake.</p><p>And, anyway, how could I possibly have invented her? How would I have known anything about her? How would I have known about the necklace? I never even met her!</p><p>\u201cDad.\u201d I look at him abruptly. \u201cWe never visited Great-Aunt Sadie, did we? Except that time when I was a baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, that\u2019s not quite true.\u201d Dad shoots me a cautious look. \u201cMum and I were talking about it after the funeral. We remembered that we once took you to see her when you were six.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSix.\u201d I swallow. \u201cWas she... wearing a necklace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe might have been.\u201d Dad shrugs.</p><p>I met Great-Aunt Sadie at the age of six. I could have seen the necklace. I could have remembered... without realizing that I remembered.</p><p>My thoughts are in free fall. I\u2019m hollow and chilly inside. I feel as though everything\u2019s turning on its head. For the first time I\u2019m seeing a new possible reality.</p> <p>I could have made this whole story up in my head. It\u2019s what I wanted. I felt so guilty we never knew her that I invented her in my subconscious. I mean, when I first saw her that\u2019s what I thought she was. A hallucination.</p><p>\u201cLara?\u201d Dad peers at me. \u201cAre you OK, darling?\u201d</p><p>I try to smile back at him, but I\u2019m too preoccupied. There are two voices arguing in my head, right across each other. The first is crying out, Sadie\u2019s real, you know she is! She\u2019s out there! She\u2019s your friend and she\u2019s hurt and you have to find her! The second is calmly intoning, She doesn\u2019t exist. She never did. You\u2019ve wasted enough time. Get your life back .</p><p>I\u2019m breathing hard, trying to let my thoughts balance out, let my instincts settle. But I don\u2019t know what to think. I don\u2019t trust myself anymore. Maybe I really am crazy...</p><p>\u201cDad, do you think I\u2019m mad?\u201d I blurt out in desperation. \u201cSeriously. Should I see someone?\u201d</p> <p>Dad bursts into laughter. \u201cNo! Darling, of course not!\u201d He puts his coffee cup down and leans forward. \u201cI think your emotions run high and sometimes your imagination too. You get that from your mother. And sometimes you let them get the better of you. But you\u2019re not mad. No madder than Mum, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d I swallow. \u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s not much consolation, to be honest.</p><p>With fumbling fingers, I pick up Uncle Bill\u2019s letter and read it through again. If I look at it in a completely different way, there\u2019s nothing sinister. There\u2019s nothing wrong. He\u2019s just a rich guy trying to help out his niece. I could take the job. I\u2019d be Lara Lington of Lingtons Coffee. I\u2019d have a great future in front of me, salary, car, prospects. Everyone would be happy. Everything would be easy. My memories of Sadie would melt away. My life would feel normal.</p><p>It would be so, so easy.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t been home for a while,\u201d Dad says kindly. \u201cWhy not come and spend the weekend? Mum would love to see you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say after a pause. \u201cI\u2019d like that. I haven\u2019t been back for ages.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll restore your spirits.\u201d Dad gives me his endearing little crooked smile. \u201cIf your life\u2019s at a juncture and you need to think about things, there\u2019s nowhere better than home. However old you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018There\u2019s no place like home.\u2019\u201d I raise half a smile.</p><p>\u201cDorothy had a point. Now eat up.\u201d He gestures at my tuna melt. But I\u2019m only half listening.</p><p>Home . The word has riveted me. I never thought of that.</p><p>She could have gone home.</p><p>Home to where her old house used to be. After all, it\u2019s the place of her earliest memories. It\u2019s where she had her big love affair. She refused ever to go back during her lifetime-but what if she\u2019s softened? What if she\u2019s right there, right now?</p><p>I\u2019m stirring my Lingtoncino around and around obsessively. I know the sane, sensible move would be to blank out all thoughts about her. Accept Uncle Bill\u2019s job and buy a bottle of champagne to celebrate with Mum and Dad. I know this.</p> <p>But... I just can\u2019t. Deep down, I can\u2019t believe she\u2019s not real. I\u2019ve come so far, I\u2019ve tried so hard to find her. I have to give it one last go.</p><p>And if she\u2019s not there I\u2019ll take the job and give up. For good.</p><p>\u201cSo.\u201d Dad wipes his mouth with a chocolate-brown napkin. \u201cYou look happier, darling.\u201d He jerks his head toward the letter. \u201cHave you decided which way you want to go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I nod firmly. \u201cI need to go to St. Pancras station.\u201d</p><p>TWENTY-THREE</p><p>OK. This is the very, very last place I\u2019m looking. This is her last chance. And I hope she appreciates the effort I\u2019ve made.</p><p>It took me an hour from St. Pancras to St. Albans and another twenty minutes in a taxi to Archbury. And now here I am, standing in a little village square, with a pub and a bus stop and a weird modern-looking church. I suppose it would be quite picturesque if lorries didn\u2019t keep rumbling by at a million miles an hour and three teenage boys weren\u2019t having a brawl under the bus shelter. I thought it was supposed to be quiet in the country. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I edge away before one of the boys pulls out a gun or something and head over to the green. There\u2019s a board with a map of the village, and I quickly locate Archbury Close. That\u2019s what they turned Archbury House into after it burned down. If Sadie really has gone home, that\u2019s where she\u2019ll be.</p><p>After a few minutes\u2019 walk, I can see the gates ahead: wrought iron with Archbury Close written in swirly iron writing. There are six little red-brick houses, each with a tiny drive and garage. It\u2019s hard to imagine that once upon a time there was just one big beautiful house sitting in its own gardens.</p><p>Feeling conspicuous, I enter through a small side gate and start to wander around, peering in through the windows, crunching on the little patches of gravel, and murmuring, \u201cSadie?\u201d</p><p>I should have asked Sadie more about her home life. Maybe she had a favorite tree or something. Or some favorite corner of the garden, which is now someone\u2019s utility room.</p> <p>There doesn\u2019t seem to be anyone around, so after a bit I raise my voice a little. \u201cSadie? Are you here? Sa-die?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me!\u201d I jump in shock as someone pokes me in the back. I turn to see a gray-haired woman in a flowered shirt, tan slacks, and rubbery-looking shoes peering at me suspiciously.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Sadie. What do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you here about the drainage?\u201d she adds.</p> <p>\u201cUm... no.\u201d I find my voice. \u201cI was after a different Sadie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich Sadie?\u201d Her eyes narrow. \u201cI\u2019m the only Sadie in this close. Sadie Williams. Number four.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. The Sadie I want is... actually... a dog,\u201d I improvise. \u201cShe ran away and I was looking for her. But I expect she\u2019s run off somewhere else. Sorry to bother you...\u201d</p><p>I start to walk off, but Sadie Williams grabs my shoulder with surprisingly strong fingers.</p><p>\u201cYou let a dog loose in the close? What did you want to do that for? We have a dog-free policy here, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell... sorry. I didn\u2019t know. Anyway, I\u2019m sure she\u2019s run off somewhere else-\u201d I try to wriggle free.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s probably prowling around in the bushes, waiting to strike!\u201d Sadie Williams is glowering furiously at me. \u201cDogs are dangerous beasts, you know. We\u2019ve got kiddies living here. You people are irresponsible!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not irresponsible!\u201d I retort indignantly before I can stop myself. \u201cShe\u2019s a perfectly friendly dog. I wouldn\u2019t let a dangerous dog loose!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll dogs are savage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, they\u2019re not!\u201d</p><p>Lara, stop it. You\u2019re talking about an imaginary dog .</p><p>\u201cAnd, anyway.\u201d I finally wrench myself free from the woman\u2019s grasp. \u201cI\u2019m sure she\u2019s not here, because she would have come when I called. She\u2019s very obedient. In fact... she\u2019s a prizewinner at Crufts,\u201d I add for good measure. \u201cSo I\u2019d better go and find her.\u201d</p><p>Before Sadie Williams can grab me again, I start walking swiftly toward the gates. There\u2019s no way Sadie\u2019s here. She would have come out to watch the entertainment.</p><p>\u201cWhat breed is she, then?\u201d calls Sadie Williams tetchily. \u201cWhat are we looking for?\u201d</p> <p>Oh God. I just can\u2019t help myself.</p><p>\u201cPit bull,\u201d I call back over my shoulder. \u201cBut, like I say, she\u2019s very friendly.\u201d</p><p>Without looking back, I hurry out of the gates, back along the road, and toward the village square. So much for that bright idea. What a waste of time.</p><p>I head to the bench on the green and sink down and take out a Twix, my gaze fixed ahead. Coming here was stupid. I\u2019ll eat this, then call a taxi and head back to London. I\u2019m not even going to think about Sadie anymore. Let alone look for her. I\u2019ve used up enough of my life already. I mean, why should I think about her? I bet she isn\u2019t thinking about me.</p><p>I finish my Twix and tell myself to dial the taxi number. It\u2019s time to go. It\u2019s time to put all this out of my mind and start on a new, sane, ghost-free life.</p><p>Except...</p><p>Oh God . I keep having flashes back to Sadie\u2019s stricken face on Waterloo Bridge. I keep hearing her voice. You don\u2019t care about me... No one cares .</p><p>If I give up after only three days, am I proving her right?</p><p>I feel a sudden surge of frustration-at her, at myself, at the whole situation. Crossly, I scrunch up my Twix wrapper and chuck it into a bin. I mean, what am I supposed to do? I\u2019ve looked and looked and looked. If she would just come when I called her... if she would just listen and not be so stubborn...</p><p>Hang on. A new thought strikes me, out of the blue. I\u2019m psychic, aren\u2019t I? Maybe I should use my psychic powers. I should summon her from the underworld. Or Harrods. Or wherever she is. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>OK. This is my last try. I really, really mean it.</p><p>I stand up and approach the little pond on the green. I\u2019m sure ponds are spiritual places. More spiritual than benches, anyway. There\u2019s a mossy stone fountain in the middle, and I can just picture Sadie dancing in it, splashing and shrieking, all those years and years ago, with some policeman trying to drag her out.</p><p>\u201cSpirits.\u201d I extend my arms cautiously. There\u2019s a rippling in the water, but that could just be the wind.</p><p>I have no idea how to do this. I\u2019ll make it up as I go along.</p> <p>\u201cIt is I, Lara,\u201d I intone in a low sepulchral voice. \u201cFriend to the spirits.

I, Lara Lington, the psychic one. Hear my voice. Hear my summons. Spirits, I entreat thee.\u201d I start to wave my arms around impressively. \u201cIf thou knowest Sadie, send her to me. Send her to me now.\u201d</p> <p>Nothing. Not a voice, not a glimpse, not a shadow.</p><p>\u201cFine!\u201d I say, dropping my arms down. \u201cDon\u2019t be summoned.\u201d I aim my words into the air, in case she\u2019s listening. \u201cI don\u2019t care. I\u2019ve got better things to do all day than stand here talking to the spirit world. So there.\u201d</p><p>I stump back to the bench, pick up my bag and grab my mobile phone. I dial the taxi firm that brought me here and ask for a taxi straightaway.</p><p>Enough is enough. I\u2019m out of here.</p><p>The taxi guy tells me the cab driver will meet me in front of the church in ten minutes, so I head over to it, wondering if they might have a coffee machine in the lobby or anything. The whole place is locked up, though. I head back out and am just reaching for my phone again to check my texts, when something catches my eye. It\u2019s a sign on a gate: The Old Vicarage .</p><p>The Old Vicarage. I suppose that would have been where the vicar lived in the old days. Which means... it would have been where Stephen Nettleton lived. He was the son of the vicar, wasn\u2019t he?</p> <p>Curiously, I peer over the wooden gate. It\u2019s a big old gray house with a gravel drive and some cars parked at the side. There are some people going in the front door, a group of about six. The family living here must be at home.</p><p>The garden\u2019s overgrown, with rhododendrons and trees and a path leading round the side of the house. I can just glimpse an old shed in the distance and wonder if that\u2019s where Stephen did his painting. I can just imagine Sadie creeping along that path, her shoes in one hand, her eyes shining in the moonlight.</p><p>It\u2019s quite an atmospheric place, with its old stone wall and long grass and shady patches in the garden. Nothing modern seems to have been introduced. It\u2019s still got the feel of history to it. I wonder-</p><p>No. Stop it. I\u2019m giving up. I\u2019m not looking anymore.</p><p>But maybe-</p><p>No. She wouldn\u2019t be here. No way. She\u2019s got too much dignity. She said it herself-she\u2019d never be a trailer. Never in a million years would she hang around an old boyfriend\u2019s house. Especially the old boyfriend who broke her heart and never even wrote to her. It\u2019s a stupid idea-</p><p>Already my hand is unlatching the gate.</p><p>This is the very, very, very last place I\u2019m looking.</p> <p>I crunch over the gravel, trying to think of an excuse to be here. Not a lost dog. Maybe I\u2019m studying old vicarages? Maybe I\u2019m an architecture student. Yes. I\u2019m doing a thesis on \u201creligious buildings and the families who live in them.\u201d At Birkbeck.</p><p>No. Harvard.</p><p>I approach the entrance and am raising my hand to ring the old bell when I notice the front door is unlatched. Maybe I can sidle in without anyone noticing. I cautiously push the door open and find myself in a hall with paneled walls and old parquet. To my surprise, a woman with a mousy bob and a Fair Isle jumper is standing behind a table covered with books and leaflets.</p><p>\u201cHello.\u201d She smiles as though she\u2019s not at all surprised to see me. \u201cAre you here for the tour?\u201d</p><p>The tour?</p><p>Even better! I can wander around and I don\u2019t even have to invent a story. I had no idea vicarages were charging for tours these days, but I suppose it makes sense.</p><p>\u201cEr... yes, please. How much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll be five pounds.\u201d</p><p>Five whole pounds? Just to see a vicarage? Bloody hell.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s a guide.\u201d She hands me a leaflet, but I don\u2019t look at it. I\u2019m not exactly interested in the house. I walk swiftly away from the woman, into a sitting room filled with old-fashioned sofas and rugs, and look all around. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSadie?\u201d I hiss. \u201cSadie, are you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis would have been where Malory spent his evenings.\u201d The woman\u2019s voice makes me jump. I didn\u2019t realize she\u2019d followed me.</p><p>\u201cOh, right.\u201d I have no idea what she\u2019s talking about. \u201cLovely. I\u2019ll just go through here...\u201d I head into an adjacent dining room, which looks like a stage set for a period drama. \u201cSadie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis was the family dining room, of course...\u201d</p> <p>For God\u2019s sake. People should be able to take tours of vicarages without being followed. I head over to the window and look out at the garden, where the family I saw before is wandering around. There\u2019s not a whisper of Sadie.</p><p>This was a stupid idea. She\u2019s not here. Why would she hang around the house of the guy who broke her heart, anyway? I turn around to leave and almost bump into the woman, standing behind me.</p><p>\u201cI take it you\u2019re an admirer of his work?\u201d She smiles.</p><p>Work? Whose work?</p><p>\u201cEr... yes,\u201d I say hastily. \u201cOf course. A great admirer. Very great.\u201d For the first time I glance down at the leaflet in my hand. The title reads: Welcome to the House of Cecil Malory , and underneath is a landscape painting of some cliffs.</p> <p>Cecil Malory. He\u2019s a famous artist, isn\u2019t he? I mean, not like Picasso, but I\u2019ve definitely heard of him. For the first time I feel a spark of interest.</p><p>\u201cSo is this where Cecil Malory once lived or something?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d She looks taken aback by the question. \u201cThat\u2019s the reason for the house being restored as a museum. He lived here \u2019til 1927.\u201d</p><p>Until 1927? Now I\u2019m genuinely interested. If he was living here in 1927, Sadie would have known him, surely. They would have hung out together.</p><p>\u201cWas he a friend of the vicar\u2019s son? A guy called Stephen Nettleton?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDear...\u201d The woman eyes me, apparently perplexed at the question. \u201cSurely you know that Stephen Nettleton was Cecil Malory. He never used his family name for his work.\u201d</p> <p>Stephen was Cecil Malory?</p><p>Stephen... is Cecil Malory?</p><p>I\u2019m too gobsmacked to speak.</p><p>\u201cHe later changed his name by deed poll,\u201d she continues. \u201cAs a protest against his parents, it\u2019s thought. After his move to France...\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m only half listening. My mind is in turmoil. Stephen became a famous painter. This makes no sense. Sadie never told me he was a famous painter. She would have boasted unbearably about it. Didn\u2019t she know?</p><p>\u201c... and never reconciled before his tragically young death.\u201d The woman ends on a solemn note, then smiles. \u201cPerhaps you would like to see the bedrooms?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I mean... Sorry.\u201d I rub my forehead. \u201cI\u2019m a bit... confused. Steph-I mean Cecil Malory-was a friend of my great-aunt, you see. She lived in this village. She knew him. But I don\u2019t think she ever realized he became famous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d The woman nods knowledgeably. \u201cWell, of course, he wasn\u2019t during his lifetime. It wasn\u2019t until long after his death that interest began in his paintings, first in France and then in his homeland. Since he died so young, there is of course a limited body of work, which is why his paintings became so prized and valuable. In the 1980s they shot up in value. That\u2019s when his name really became known widely.\u201d</p> <p>The 1980s. Sadie had her stroke in 1981. She went into care. No one told her anything. She had no idea what was going on in the outside world.</p><p>I look up from my reverie to see the woman giving me another odd look. I bet she\u2019s wishing she could give me my five quid back and get rid of me.</p><p>\u201cEr... Sorry. I\u2019m just thinking. Did he work in a shed in the garden?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d The woman\u2019s face lights up. \u201cIf you\u2019re interested, we do sell a number of books on Malory...\u201d She hurries out and returns holding a slim hardback. \u201cDetails about his early life are a little sketchy, as many village records were lost during the war, and by the time the research was being done, many of his contemporaries had passed away. However, there are some lovely accounts of his time in France, when his landscape drawing really took off.\u201d She hands me the book, which has a painting of the sea on the front.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I take it from her and start flipping through. Almost at once I come across a black-and-white photograph of a man painting on a cliff, captioned A rare image of Cecil Malory at work . I can instantly see why he and Sadie would have been lovers. He\u2019s tall and dark and powerful-looking, with dark eyes and an ancient tattered shirt. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Bastard .</p><p>He probably thought he was a genius. He probably thought he was too good for a normal relationship. Even though he\u2019s long dead, I\u2019m fighting an urge to yell at him. How could he treat Sadie so badly? How could he go off to France and forget about her?</p><p>\u201cHe was a towering talent.\u201d The woman is following my gaze. \u201cHis early death was one of the tragedies of the twentieth century.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, maybe he deserved it.\u201d I give her a baleful look. \u201cMaybe he should have been nicer to his girlfriend. Did you think of that?\u201d</p> <p>The woman looks totally confused. She opens her mouth and closes it again.</p><p>I flip on, past pictures of the sea and more cliffs and a line drawing of a hen... and then I suddenly freeze. An eye is looking out of the book at me. It\u2019s a blown-up detail from a painting. Just one eye, with long, long lashes and a teasing glint.</p><p>I know that eye.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me.\u201d I can barely get the words out. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d I\u2019m jabbing at the book. \u201cWho\u2019s this? Where does this come from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDear...\u201d I can see the woman trying to keep her patience. \u201cYou must know that, surely. That\u2019s a detail from one of his most famous paintings. We have a version in the library if you\u2019d like to have a look-\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d I\u2019m already moving. \u201cI would. Please. Show me.\u201d</p><p>She leads me down a creaking corridor, through to a dim, carpeted room. There are bookshelves on every wall, old leather chairs, and a large painting hanging over the fireplace.</p><p>\u201cThere we are,\u201d she says fondly. \u201cOur pride and joy.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t reply. My throat\u2019s too tight. I stand motionless, clutching the book, just staring.</p><p>There she is. Gazing out of the ornate gilt frame, looking as though she owns the world, is Sadie.</p><p>I\u2019ve never seen her as radiant as she looks in this picture. I\u2019ve never seen her so relaxed. So happy. So beautiful. Her eyes are massive, dark, luminous with love.</p> <p>She\u2019s reclining on a chaise, naked except for a gauze fabric draped over her shoulder and hips, which only partially obscures the view. Her shingled hair exposes the length of her elegant neck. She\u2019s wearing glittering earrings. And around her neck, falling down between her pale, gauzy breasts, twined around her fingers, tumbling in a shimmering pool of beads, is the dragonfly necklace.</p><p>I can suddenly hear her voice again in my ears. I was happy when I wore it... I felt beautiful. Like a goddess .</p><p>It all makes sense. This is why she wanted the necklace. This is what it means to her. At that time in her life, she was happy. Never mind what happened before or after. Never mind that her heart got broken. At that precise moment, everything was perfect.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s... amazing.\u201d I wipe a tear from my eye.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t she wonderful?\u201d The woman gives me a pleased look. Obviously I\u2019m finally behaving as proper art-lovers are supposed to. \u201cThe detail and brushwork are just exquisite. Every bead in the necklace is a tiny masterpiece. It\u2019s painted with such love.\u201d She regards the portrait affectionately. \u201cAnd all the more special, of course, because it\u2019s the only one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I say, confused. \u201cCecil Malory painted lots of pictures, didn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed. But he never painted any other portraits. He refused to, his whole life. He was asked plenty of times in France as his reputation grew locally, but he would always reply, \u2018J\u2019ai peint celui que j\u2019ai voulu peindre.\u2019 \u201d The woman leaves a poetic pause. \u201cI have painted the one I wanted to paint.\u201d</p><p>I stare at her, dumbfounded, my head sparking as I take this all in. He only ever painted Sadie? His whole life? He\u2019d painted the one he wanted to paint?</p> <p>\u201cAnd in this bead...\u201d The woman moves toward the painting with a knowing smile. \u201cRight in this bead here there\u2019s a little surprise. A little secret, if you like.\u201d She beckons me forward. \u201cCan you see it?\u201d</p><p>I try to focus obediently on the bead. It just looks like a bead.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s almost impossible, except under a magnifying glass... here.\u201d She produces a piece of matte paper. Printed on it is the bead from the painting, enlarged massively. As I peer at it, to my astonishment I find I\u2019m looking at a face. A man\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cIs that...\u201d I look up.</p><p>\u201cMalory.\u201d She nods in delight. \u201cHis own reflection in the necklace. He put himself into the painting. The most miniature hidden portrait. It was discovered only ten years ago. Like a little secret message.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay I see?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>With shaking hands, I take the paper from her and stare at him.

I know it.</p><p>I look up at the painting, tears blurring my eyes again. The woman\u2019s right. He painted her with love. You can see it in every brushstroke.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s... amazing.\u201d I swallow. \u201cAre there... um... any more books about him?\u201d I\u2019m desperate to get this woman out of the room. I wait until her footsteps have disappeared down the passage, then tilt my head up.</p> <p>\u201cSadie!\u201d I call desperately. \u201cSadie, can you hear me? I\u2019ve found the painting! It\u2019s beautiful. You\u2019re beautiful. You\u2019re in a museum! And you know what? Stephen didn\u2019t paint anyone but you. Never, his whole life. You were the only one. He put himself in your necklace. He loved you. Sadie, I know he loved you. I so wish you could see this-\u201d</p><p>I break off breathlessly, but the room is silent and dead. She\u2019s not hearing me, wherever she is. As I hear footsteps, I quickly turn and plaster on a smile. The woman hands me a pile of books.</p><p>\u201cThis is all our available stock. Are you an art-history student or simply interested in Malory?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just interested in this one painting,\u201d I say frankly. \u201cAnd I was wondering. Do you... or the experts... have any idea who this is? What\u2019s the painting called?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s called Girl with a Necklace . And, of course, many people are interested in the identity of the sitter.\u201d The woman launches into what\u2019s clearly a well-rehearsed speech. \u201cSome research has been done, but unfortunately, to date, no one has been able to identify her beyond what is believed to be her first name.\u201d She pauses, then adds fondly, \u201cMabel.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMabel?\u201d I stare at her in horror. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t called Mabel!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDear!\u201d The woman gives me a reproving smile. \u201cI know to modern ears it may seem a little quaint, but, believe me, Mabel was a common name of the time. And on the back of the painting there\u2019s an inscription. Malory himself wrote, My Mabel.\u201d</p><p>For God\u2019s sake.</p><p>\u201cIt was a nickname! It was their private joke! Her name was Sadie, OK? Sadie Lancaster. I\u2019ll write it down. And I know it was her because...\u201d I hesitate momentously. \u201cThis is my great-aunt.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m expecting a gasp or something, but the woman just gives me a dubious look.</p><p>\u201cGoodness, dear. That\u2019s quite a claim. What makes you think she\u2019s your great-aunt?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think she is, I know she is. She lived here in Archbury. She knew Steph-I mean Cecil Malory. They were lovers. It\u2019s definitely her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have any evidence? Do you have a photograph of her in her youth? Any archives?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell... no,\u201d I say, a little frustrated. \u201cBut I know it\u2019s her, beyond a doubt. And I\u2019ll prove it somehow. And you should put a sign up saying her name and stop calling her Mabel-\u201d I pause mid-track as something new and startling occurs to me. \u201cHang on a minute. This is Sadie\u2019s painting! He gave it to her! She lost it for years, but it\u2019s still hers. Or, I suppose, Dad\u2019s and Uncle Bill\u2019s now. How did you get it? What\u2019s it doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d The woman sounds bewildered, and I give an impatient sigh.</p><p>\u201cThis painting belonged to my great-aunt. But it was lost, years and years ago. The family house burned down and she thought the painting was destroyed. So how did it end up hanging on this wall?\u201d I can\u2019t help sounding accusing, and she recoils.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid I have no idea. I\u2019ve worked here for ten years and it\u2019s certainly been here all that time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d I assume a businesslike air. \u201cWell, can I please talk to the director of this museum or whoever\u2019s in charge of this painting? At once?\u201d</p><p>The woman gives me a wary, puzzled look. \u201cDear... you do realize this is only a reproduction, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I feel wrong-footed. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe original is four times the size and, dare I say it, even more splendid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d I look at the painting in confusion. It looks pretty real to me. \u201cSo, where\u2019s the original? Locked up in a safe or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, dear,\u201d she says patiently. \u201cIt\u2019s hanging in the London Portrait Gallery.\u201d</p><p>TWENTY-FOUR</p><p>It\u2019s massive. It\u2019s radiant. It\u2019s a million times better than the one in the house. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019ve been sitting in front of Sadie\u2019s portrait in the London Portrait Gallery for about two hours. I can\u2019t drag myself away. She\u2019s gazing out at the gallery, her brow clear, her eyes a velvety dark green, like the most beautiful goddess you\u2019ve ever seen. Cecil Malory\u2019s use of light on her skin is unmatched in its artistry. I know, because I heard an art teacher telling her class half an hour ago. Then they all went up to see if they could spot the little miniature portrait in the necklace.</p><p>I must have seen a hundred people coming and looking at her. Sighing with pleasure. Smiling at one another. Or just sitting down and gazing.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t she lovely?\u201d A dark-haired woman in a mac smiles at me and sits down beside me on the bench. \u201cThis is my favorite portrait in the whole gallery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d I nod.</p> <p>\u201cI wonder what she\u2019s thinking?\u201d the woman muses.</p><p>\u201cI think she\u2019s in love.\u201d I look yet again at Sadie\u2019s glowing eyes, the flush in her cheek. \u201cAnd I think she\u2019s really, really happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re probably right.\u201d</p><p>For a moment we\u2019re both quiet, just drinking her in.</p><p>\u201cShe does you good, doesn\u2019t she?\u201d says the woman. \u201cI often come and look at her in my lunchtimes. Just to cheer myself up. I\u2019ve got a poster of her at home too. My daughter bought it for me. But you can\u2019t beat the real thing, can you?\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s a sudden lump in my throat, but I manage to smile back. \u201cNo. You can\u2019t beat the real thing.\u201d</p><p>As I\u2019m speaking, a Japanese family approaches the painting. I can see the mother pointing out the necklace to her daughter. They both sigh happily, then adopt identical poses, arms folded, heads tilted, and just gaze at her.</p><p>Sadie\u2019s adored by all these people. Tens, hundreds, thousands. And she has no idea.</p><p>I\u2019ve called for her until I\u2019m hoarse, over and over, out the window, up and down the street. But she doesn\u2019t hear. Or she doesn\u2019t want to hear. Abruptly, I stand up and consult my watch; I have to go, anyway. It\u2019s five o\u2019clock. Time for my appointment with Malcolm Gledhill, the collections manager.</p><p>I make my way back to the foyer, give my name to the receptionist, and wait among a swarming crowd of French schoolchildren until a voice from behind says, \u201cMiss Lington?\u201d I turn to see a man in a purple shirt, with a chestnut beard and tufts of hair growing out of his ears, beaming at me with twinkly eyes. He looks like Father Christmas before he grew old, and I can\u2019t help warming to him instantly.</p><p>\u201cHi. Yes, I\u2019m Lara Lington.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMalcolm Gledhill. Come this way.\u201d He leads me through a hidden door behind the reception desk, up some stairs, and into a corner office overlooking the Thames. Postcards and reproductions of paintings are everywhere, stuck up on the walls and propped against books and adorning his massive computer.</p><p>\u201cSo.\u201d He hands me a cup of tea and sits down. \u201cYou\u2019re here to see me about Girl with a Necklace?\u201d He eyes me warily. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure from your message quite what the issue was. But it\u2019s clearly... pressing?\u201d</p><p>OK, perhaps my message was a bit extreme. I didn\u2019t want to have to tell the whole story to some nameless receptionist, so I simply said it was to do with Girl with a Necklace and a matter of life and death, state urgency, and national security.</p><p>Well. In the art world, it probably is all those things.</p><p>\u201cIt is quite pressing.\u201d I nod. \u201cAnd the first thing I want to say is, she wasn\u2019t just \u2018a girl.\u2019 She was my great-aunt. Look.\u201d</p><p>I reach into my bag and produce my photograph of Sadie at the nursing home, wearing the necklace.</p><p>\u201cLook at the necklace,\u201d I add, as I hand it over.</p><p>I knew I liked this Malcolm Gledhill guy. He reacts in a totally satisfactory manner. His eyes bulge. His cheeks turn pink with excitement. He looks up sharply at me, then back at the photo. He peers at the necklace around Sadie\u2019s neck. Then he gives a harrumphing cough as though he\u2019s concerned he\u2019s given too much away.</p> <p>\u201cAre you saying,\u201d he says at last, \u201cthat this lady here is the \u2018Mabel\u2019 in the painting?\u201d</p><p>I really have to knock this Mabel thing on the head.</p><p>\u201cShe wasn\u2019t called Mabel.

How much more evidence do you need?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes the necklace still exist?\u201d His eyes bulge again. \u201cDo you have it? Is she still alive?\u201d As this new thought occurs to him, his eyes nearly pop out of his head. \u201cBecause that would really be-\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s just died, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d I cut him off before he can get too excited. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t have the necklace. But I\u2019m trying to track it down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d Malcolm Gledhill takes out a paisley handkerchief and wipes his perspiring brow. \u201cClearly, in a case like this, much careful inquiry and research is required before we can come to any definitive conclusion-\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s her,\u201d I say firmly.</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019ll refer you, if I may, to our research team. They will look at your claim very carefully, study all the evidence available.\u201d</p><p>He needs to play the official game properly. I can understand that.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to talk to them,\u201d I say politely. \u201cAnd I know they\u2019ll agree with me. It\u2019s her.\u201d</p><p>I suddenly spot a postcard of Girl with a Necklace stuck on his computer with Blu-Tack. I take it down and lay it beside the photo of Sadie from the nursing home. For a moment we both look silently at the two images. Two radiant, proud eyes in one picture; two hooded, ancient eyes in the other. And the necklace glimmering, a constant talisman, linking the two.</p> <p>\u201cWhen did your great-aunt die?\u201d says Malcolm Gledhill at last, his voice soft.</p><p>\u201cA few weeks ago. But she lived in a nursing home since the 1980s, and she didn\u2019t know much about the outside world. She never knew Stephen Nettleton became famous. She never knew that she was famous. She thought she was a nobody. And that\u2019s why I want the world to know her name.\u201d</p><p>Malcolm Gledhill nods. \u201cWell, if the research team comes to the conclusion that she was the sitter in the portrait... then, believe me, the world will know her name. Our marketing team did some research recently, and it turns out Girl with a Necklace is the most popular portrait in the gallery. They want to expand her profile. We consider her an exceedingly valuable asset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I flush with pride. \u201cShe\u2019d have loved to know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay I call in a colleague to see this photograph?\u201d His eyes brighten. \u201cHe has a special interest in Malory, and I know he will be extremely interested in your claim-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d I hold up a hand. \u201cBefore you call in anyone else, there\u2019s another issue I need to talk to you about. In private. I want to know how you got the painting in the first place. It belonged to Sadie. It was hers. How did you get it?\u201d</p> <p>Malcolm Gledhill stiffens very slightly.</p><p>\u201cI thought this matter might arise at some stage,\u201d he says. \u201cFollowing your phone call, I went and retrieved the file, and I\u2019ve looked up the details of the acquisition.\u201d He opens a file, which has been sitting on the desk all this while, and unfolds an old piece of paper. \u201cThe painting was sold to us in the 1980s.\u201d</p><p>Sold? How could it have been sold?</p><p>\u201cBut it was lost after a fire. No one knew where it was. Who on earth sold it to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid...\u201d Malcolm Gledhill pauses. \u201cI\u2019m afraid the vendor asked at the time that all details of the acquisition should be kept confidential.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConfidential?\u201d I stare at him in outrage. \u201cBut the painting was Sadie\u2019s. Stephen gave it to her. Whoever got hold of it didn\u2019t have the right to sell it. You should check these things!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe do check these things,\u201d says Malcolm Gledhill, a little defensively. \u201cAll the provenance was deemed to be correct at the time. The gallery went to all reasonable lengths to determine that the painting was the vendor\u2019s to sell. Indeed, a letter was signed in which the vendor made all the correct assurances. I have it here.\u201d</p><p>His eyes keep dropping down to the paper in his hand. He must be looking at the name of whoever sold it. This is totally maddening.</p> <p>\u201cWell, whatever that person said to you, they were lying.\u201d I glare at him. \u201cAnd you know what? I\u2019m a taxpayer, and I fund you lot. In fact, in a way, I own you lot. And I hereby demand to know who sold it to you. At once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid you\u2019re mistaken,\u201d says Malcolm Gledhill mildly. \u201cWe are not a publicly owned gallery, and you don\u2019t own us. Believe me, I would like to clear this matter up as much as you would. But I am bound by our confidentiality agreement. I\u2019m afraid my hands are tied.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat if I come back with police and lawyers?\u201d I plant my hands on my hips. \u201cWhat if I report the painting as stolen goods and force you to reveal the name?\u201d</p><p>Malcolm Gledhill raises his tufty eyebrows high. \u201cObviously, if there was a police inquiry, we would comply fully.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, fine. There will be. I have friends in the police, you know,\u201d I add darkly. \u201cDI James. He\u2019ll be very interested to hear about all this.

Paintings don\u2019t just turn up out of the blue.</p> <p>\u201cI can understand your concerns.\u201d Malcolm Gledhill hesitates. \u201cBelieve me, the gallery takes the issue of rightful ownership extremely seriously.\u201d</p><p>He won\u2019t meet my eye. His gaze keeps flicking to the paper in his hand. The name\u2019s on there. I know it. I could hurl myself across the desk, wrestle him to the ground, and-</p><p>No.</p><p>\u201cWell, thank you for your time,\u201d I say formally. \u201cI\u2019ll be in touch again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Malcolm Gledhill is closing up the file again. \u201cBefore you go, if I might just call in my colleague Jeremy Mustoe? I\u2019m sure he\u2019d be very interested to meet you and to see the photograph of your great-aunt...\u201d</p> <p>A few moments later, a skinny man with fraying cuffs and a prominent Adam\u2019s apple is in the room, poring over the photograph of Sadie and saying, \u201cRemarkable,\u201d over and over under his breath.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been extremely hard to discover anything about this painting,\u201d Jeremy Mustoe says, looking up at last. \u201cThere are so few contemporary records or photographs, and by the time researchers returned to the village, it was generations later and no one could remember anything. And, of course, it had been assumed that the sitter was indeed named Mabel.\u201d He wrinkles his brow. \u201cI think one thesis was published in the early 1990s suggesting that a servant of the Nettleton house was Malory\u2019s sitter, and that his parents disapproved of their liaison for class reasons, which led to him being sent to France...\u201d</p><p>I want to laugh. Someone basically made up a completely wrong story and called it \u201cresearch\u201d?</p><p>\u201cThere was a Mabel,\u201d I explain patiently. \u201cBut she wasn\u2019t the sitter. Stephen called Sadie \u2018Mabel\u2019 to wind her up. They were lovers,\u201d I add. \u201cThat\u2019s why he was sent to France.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d Jeremy Mustoe looks up and focuses on me with renewed interest. \u201cSo... would your great-aunt also be the \u2018Mabel\u2019 in the letters?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe letters!\u201d exclaims Malcolm Gledhill. \u201cOf course! I\u2019d forgotten about those. It\u2019s such a long time since I\u2019ve looked at them-\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLetters?\u201d I look from face to face. \u201cWhat letters?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have in our archive a bundle of old letters written by Malory,\u201d explains Jeremy Mustoe. \u201cOne of the very few sets of documents salvaged after his death. It\u2019s not clear if all of them were sent, but one has clearly been posted and returned. Unfortunately the address was scribbled out in blue-black ink, and despite the very best modern technology, we\u2019ve been unable to-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to interrupt.\u201d I cut him off, trying to hide my agitation. \u201cBut... could I see them?\u201d</p><p>An hour later I walk out of the gallery, my mind whirling. When I close my eyes all I can see is that faded, loopy script on tiny sheets of writing paper.</p><p>I didn\u2019t read all his letters. They felt too private, and I only had a few minutes to look at them, anyway. But I read enough to know. He loved her. Even after he\u2019d gone to France. Even after he heard that she\u2019d got married to someone else.</p><p>Sadie spent all her life waiting for the answer to a question. And now I know he did too. And even though the affair happened more than eighty years ago, even though Stephen is dead and Sadie is dead and there\u2019s nothing anyone can do about it, I\u2019m still seething with misery as I stride along the pavement. It was all so unfair. It was all so wrong. They should have been together. Someone obviously intercepted his letters before they got to Sadie. Probably those evil Victorian parents of hers.</p><p>So she sat there with no idea of the truth. Thinking she\u2019d been used. Too proud to go after him and find out for herself. She accepted the proposal of Waistcoat Guy as some stupid gesture of revenge. Maybe she was hoping Stephen would appear at the church. Even as she was getting ready for the wedding, she must have hoped, surely. And he let her down. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I can\u2019t bear it. I want to go back in time and put it all right. If only Sadie hadn\u2019t married Waistcoat Guy. If only Stephen hadn\u2019t gone to France. If only her parents had never caught them. If only-</p><p>No. Stop with the if-onlys. There\u2019s no point. He\u2019s long dead. She\u2019s dead. The story\u2019s over.</p><p>There\u2019s a stream of people walking past me on their way to Waterloo station, but I don\u2019t feel ready to go back to my little flat yet. I need some fresh air. I need a bit of perspective. I push my way past a group of tourists and head up to Waterloo Bridge. The last time I was here, the clouds were low and gray. Sadie was standing on the barricade. I was yelling desperately into the wind.</p><p>But this evening is warm and balmy. The Thames is blue, with only the tiniest white ruffles. A pleasure boat is cruising slowly along, and a couple of people are waving up at the London Eye.</p> <p>I stop at the same place as before and gaze out toward Big Ben. But I\u2019m not seeing anything properly. My mind feels lodged in the past. I keep seeing Stephen\u2019s dated, scratchy writing. I keep hearing his old-fashioned phrases. I keep picturing him, sit ting on a clifftop in France, writing to Sadie. I even keep hearing snatches of Charleston music, as though a twenties band is playing</p><p>Hang on a minute.</p><p>A twenties band is playing.</p><p>I suddenly focus on the scene below me. A few hundred meters away in Jubilee Gardens, people are gathered on the big square of grass. A bandstand has been put up. A band is playing a jazzy dance number. People are dancing. Of course. It\u2019s the jazz festival. The one they were leafleting about when I came here with Ed. The one I still have a ticket for, folded up in my purse.</p><p>For a moment I just stand there on the bridge, watching the scene. The band is playing the Charleston. Girls in twenties costumes are dancing on the stage, fringes and beads flashing back and forth. I can see bright eyes and twinkling feet and bobbing feathers. And suddenly, among the crowd, I see... I think I glimpse...</p> <p>No.</p><p>For a moment I\u2019m transfixed. Then, without allowing my brain to think what it\u2019s trying to think, without letting a single hope flicker to life, I turn and start walking calmly along the bridge, down the steps. Somehow I force myself not to rush or run. I just move steadily toward the sound of the music, breathing hard, my hands clenched tight.</p><p>There\u2019s a banner strung over the bandstand, silver balloons are gathered in bunches, and a trumpeter in a shiny waistcoat is on his feet, playing a tricky solo. All around, people are gathered, watching the Charleston dancers onstage, and on a wooden dance-floor laid on the grass, people are dancing themselves-some in jeans and some in so-called 1920s costumes. Everyone\u2019s smiling admiringly and pointing at the costumes, but to me, they look rubbish. Even the flapper girls onstage. They\u2019re just imitations, with fake feathers and plastic pearls and modern shoes and twenty-first-century makeup. They look nothing like the real thing. Nothing like a proper twenties girl. Nothing like-</p><p>And I stop dead, my heart in my throat. I was right.</p><p>She\u2019s up by the bandstand, dancing her heart out. She\u2019s in a pale yellow dress, with a matching band around her dark hair. She looks more wraithlike than ever. Her head is thrown back and her eyes are closed in concentration, and she looks as though she\u2019s shutting out the world. People are dancing through her, trampling on her feet and elbowing her, but she doesn\u2019t even seem to notice.</p><p>God knows what she\u2019s been doing, these last few days.</p> <p>As I watch, she disappears behind two laughing girls in denim jackets, and I feel a dart of panic. I can\u2019t lose her again. Not after all this.</p><p>\u201cSadie!\u201d I start pushing my way through the crowd. \u201cSa-die! It\u2019s me, Lara!\u201d</p><p>I catch a glimpse of her again, her eyes opened wide. She\u2019s looking all around. She heard me.</p><p>\u201cSadie! Over here!\u201d I\u2019m waving frantically, and a few people turn to see who I\u2019m yelling at.</p><p>Suddenly she sees me, and her whole body goes motionless. Her expression is unfathomable and, as I near her, I feel a sudden apprehension. Somehow my perspective on Sadie has changed over the past few days. She\u2019s not just a girl. She\u2019s not even just my guardian angel, if she ever was that. She\u2019s a part of art history. She\u2019s famous. And she doesn\u2019t even know it.</p><p>\u201cSadie-\u201d I break off helplessly. I don\u2019t know where to start. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I\u2019ve been looking everywhere for you-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you can\u2019t have looked very hard!\u201d She\u2019s busy scanning the band and appears totally unmoved by my appearance. In spite of myself, I feel a familiar indignation rising.</p><p>\u201cI did! I\u2019ve spent days searching, if you want to know! Calling, shouting, looking-you have no idea what I went through!\u201d</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cActually, I do.

I need to tell you about it.\u201d I\u2019m trying to find a way of edging tactfully into the subject of Archbury and Stephen and the painting, but all of a sudden Sadie lifts her head and says, with a tiny grudging shrug:</p><p>\u201cI missed you.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m so taken aback I\u2019m thrown off my stride. I feel a sudden prickle in my nose and rub it awkwardly.</p><p>\u201cWell... me too. I missed you too.\u201d Instinctively, I put my arms out to give her a hug-then realize how pointless that is and drop my hands down again. \u201cSadie, listen. There\u2019s something I\u2019ve got to tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd there\u2019s something I\u2019ve got to tell you!\u201d she cuts in with satisfaction. \u201cI knew you\u2019d come tonight. I was waiting for you.\u201d</p> <p>Honestly. She really does think she\u2019s an all-powerful deity.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t have known,\u201d I say patiently. \u201cEven I didn\u2019t know I was going to come. I just happened to be in the area, I heard the music, I wandered over-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did know,\u201d she insists. \u201cAnd if you didn\u2019t appear, I was going to find you and make you come. And do you know the reason?\u201d Her eyes have started to glitter, and she\u2019s peering this way and that through the crowd.</p><p>\u201cSadie.\u201d I try to fix her eyes. \u201cPlease. Listen to me. I\u2019ve got something really, really important to tell you. We need to go somewhere quiet, you need to listen, it\u2019ll be a shock-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ve got something really important to show you!\u201d She\u2019s not even listening to me properly. \u201cThere!\u201d She suddenly points in triumph. \u201cOver there! Look!\u201d</p><p>I follow her gaze, squinting as I try to make out what she\u2019s talking about... and my heart drops in dismay.</p> <p>Ed.</p><p>He\u2019s standing at the side of the dance floor. He\u2019s holding a plastic glass of something, watching the band, and occasionally stumping from side to side to the music as though out of a sense of duty. He looks so unenthusiastic, I would almost want to laugh, if I didn\u2019t also want to shrivel up and hide in a little box somewhere.</p><p>\u201cSadie...\u201d I clutch my head. \u201cWhat have you done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo and talk to him!\u201d She motions me briskly.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say in horror. \u201cDon\u2019t be stupid!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo on!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t talk to him. He hates me.\u201d I quickly swivel away and hide behind a group of dancers before Ed can catch sight of me. Just seeing him is bringing back all kinds of memories I would rather forget. \u201cWhy did you make him come here, anyway?\u201d I mutter at Sadie. \u201cWhat exactly are you trying to achieve?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI felt guilty.\u201d She gives me an accusing gaze, as though this is all my fault. \u201cI don\u2019t like feeling guilty. So I decided to do something about it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou went and yelled at him.\u201d I shake my head in disbelief.</p><p>This is all I need. She obviously frog-marched him here under total duress. He was probably planning a nice quiet evening in and now he finds himself standing at some stupid jazz festival, amid a load of dancing couples, all on his own. He\u2019s probably having the worst evening of his life. And now she expects me to talk to him.</p><p>\u201cI thought he was yours, anyway. I thought I ruined everything. What happened to all that?\u201d</p><p>Sadie flinches slightly but holds her head high. I can see her looking at Ed through the crowd. There\u2019s a brief, soft longing in her eyes, then she turns away.</p><p>\u201cNot my type after all,\u201d she says crisply. \u201cHe\u2019s far too... alive. And so are you. So you\u2019re well matched. Off you go! Ask him to dance.\u201d She tries to push me toward Ed again.</p><p>\u201cSadie.\u201d I shake my head. \u201cI really appreciate you making the effort. But I can\u2019t just make things up with him out of the blue. It\u2019s not the right place, it\u2019s not the right time. Now, can we go somewhere and talk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it\u2019s the right time and place!\u201d retorts Sadie, affronted. \u201cThat\u2019s why he\u2019s here! That\u2019s why you\u2019re here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not why I\u2019m here!\u201d I\u2019m starting to lose it. I wish I could take her by the shoulders and shake her. \u201cSadie, don\u2019t you understand? I need to talk to you! There are things I need to tell you! And you have to focus. You have to listen. Forget about Ed and me. This is about you! And Stephen! And your past! I\u2019ve found out what happened!

Did he hear me mentioning his name?</p><p>\u201cYou found the painting?\u201d Sadie\u2019s voice is only a whisper and her eyes seem suddenly hollow as she stares at me. \u201cYou found Stephen\u2019s painting?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d I mutter, a hand in front of my mouth. \u201cYou have to see it, it\u2019s amazing-\u201d</p><p>\u201cLara.\u201d Ed has reached me. At the sight of him I have a flashback to the London Eye, and all sorts of crawling feelings come over me again.</p><p>\u201cOh. Um, hi,\u201d I manage, my chest tight.</p><p>\u201cWhere is it?\u201d Sadie tries to tug at my arm. \u201cWhere is it?\u201d</p><p>Ed looks as uncomfortable as I feel. His hands are jammed in his pockets, and his frown is back in place as deep as it ever was. \u201cSo you came.\u201d He meets my eyes briefly, then looks away. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure if you would.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUm... well...\u201d I clear my throat. \u201cI just thought... you know...\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m trying to be coherent, but it\u2019s almost impossible with Sadie bobbing around to get my attention.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you find out?\u201d Now she\u2019s right in front of me, her voice high-pitched and urgent. It\u2019s as though she\u2019s suddenly woken up and realized I might have something of genuine importance for her. \u201cTell me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will tell you. Just wait.\u201d I\u2019m trying to talk subtly, out of the side of my mouth, but Ed is too sharp. He picks up everything.</p><p>\u201cTell me what?\u201d he says, his eyes scanning my face intently.</p><p>\u201cUm...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTell me!\u201d demands Sadie.</p><p>OK. I cannot cope with this. Both Sadie and Ed are standing in front of me, with expectant faces. My eyes are darting madly from one to the other. Any minute Ed is going to decide I really am a lunatic, and go.</p><p>\u201cLara?\u201d Ed takes a step toward me. \u201cAre you OK?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I mean, no. I mean...\u201d I take a breath. \u201cI wanted to tell you that I\u2019m sorry I left our date in such a rush. I\u2019m sorry you thought I was setting you up for a job. But I wasn\u2019t. I really wasn\u2019t. And I really hope you believe me-\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop talking to him!\u201d interrupts Sadie in a burst of fury, but I don\u2019t move a muscle. Ed\u2019s dark, serious gaze is on mine and I can\u2019t tear my eyes away.</p><p>\u201cI do believe you,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I need to apologize too. I overreacted. I didn\u2019t give you a chance. Afterward I regretted it. I realized I\u2019d thrown away something... a friendship... that was...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I manage.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d There\u2019s a questioning look in his face. \u201cI think we had something good. Didn\u2019t we?\u201d</p> <p>This is the moment to nod and say yes. But I can\u2019t leave it at that. I don\u2019t want a good friendship. I want that feeling back, when he wrapped his arms around me and kissed me. I want him. That\u2019s the truth.</p><p>\u201cYou want me just to be your... friend?\u201d I force myself to say the words, and instantly I can see something change in Ed\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cStop it! Talk to me!\u201d Sadie whirls over to Ed and screeches in his ear. \u201cStop talking to Lara! Go away!\u201d For a moment he gets that distant look in his eye, and I can tell he\u2019s heard her. But he doesn\u2019t move. His eyes just crinkle into a warm, tender smile.</p><p>\u201cYou want the truth? I think you\u2019re my guardian angel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I try to laugh, but it doesn\u2019t quite come out right.</p><p>\u201cDo you know what it\u2019s like to have someone crash into your life with no warning?\u201d Ed shakes his head reminiscently. \u201cWhen you landed in my office, I was, like, Who the fuck is this? But you shook me up. You brought me back to life at a time when I was in limbo. You were just what I needed.\u201d He hesitates, then adds, \u201cYou\u2019re just what I need.\u201d His voice is lower and darker; there\u2019s something in his look which is making me tingle all over.</p><p>\u201cWell, I need you too.\u201d My voice is constricted. \u201cSo we\u2019re even.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t need me.\u201d He smiles ruefully. \u201cYou\u2019re doing just fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK.\u201d I hesitate. \u201cMaybe I don\u2019t need you. But... I want you.\u201d</p><p>For a moment neither of us speaks. His eyes are locked on mine. My heart is thumping so hard, I\u2019m sure he can hear it.</p><p>\u201cGo away, Ed!\u201d Sadie suddenly screeches in Ed\u2019s ear. \u201cDo this later!\u201d</p> <p>I can see Ed flinch at the sound of her, and I feel a familiar foreboding. If Sadie messes this up for me, I will, I will...</p><p>\u201cLeave!\u201d Sadie is shrieking incessantly at him. \u201cTell her you\u2019ll call later! Go away! Go home!\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m aching with anger at her. Stop! I want to yell. Leave him alone! But I\u2019m powerless. I just have to watch the light come on in Ed\u2019s eyes as he hears her and registers what she\u2019s saying. It\u2019s like Josh all over again. She\u2019s ruined everything again.</p><p>\u201cYou know, sometimes you hear a voice in your head,\u201d Ed says, as though the thought has just occurred to him. \u201cLike... an instinct.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you do,\u201d I say miserably. \u201cYou hear a voice and it has a message and it\u2019s telling you to go away. I understand.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s telling me the opposite.\u201d Ed moves forward and firmly takes hold of my shoulders. \u201cIt\u2019s telling me not to let you go. It\u2019s telling me you\u2019re the best thing that\u2019s happened to me and I better not fuck this one up.\u201d</p><p>And before I can even take a breath, he leans down and kisses me. His arms wrap around me, strong and secure and resolute.</p><p>I\u2019m in a state of total disbelief. He\u2019s not walking away. He\u2019s not listening to Sadie. Whatever voice is in his head... it\u2019s not hers.</p><p>At last he draws away and smiles down at me, pushing a strand of hair gently off my face. I smile back, breathless, resisting the temptation to pull him down straightaway for another snog.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to dance, twenties girl?\u201d he says.</p><p>I want to dance. I want to do more than dance. I want to spend all evening and all night with him.</p> <p>I shoot a surreptitious glance at Sadie. She\u2019s moved away a few feet and is studying her shoes, her shoulders hunched over, her hands twisted together in a complicated knot. She looks up and shrugs, with a tiny sad smile of defeat.</p><p>\u201cDance with him,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s all right. I\u2019ll wait.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s waited years and years and years to find out the truth about Stephen. And now she\u2019s willing to wait even longer, just so I can dance with Ed.</p><p>There\u2019s a tugging in my heart. If I could, I\u2019d throw my arms around her.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I shake my head firmly. \u201cIt\u2019s your turn. Ed...\u201d I turn to him with a deep breath. \u201cI have to tell you about my great-aunt. She died recently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. OK. Sure. I didn\u2019t know.\u201d He looks puzzled. \u201cYou want to talk over dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I need to talk about it right now.\u201d I drag him to the edge of the dance floor, away from the band. \u201cIt\u2019s really important. Her name was Sadie, and she was in love with this guy Stephen in the 1920s. And she thought he was a bastard who used her and forgot about her. But he loved her. I know he did. Even after he went to France, he loved her.\u201d</p><p>My words are spilling out in an urgent stream. I\u2019m looking directly at Sadie. I have to get my message across. She has to believe me.</p> <p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d Her chin is as haughty as ever, but her voice has a giveaway tremble. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know because he wrote letters to her from France.\u201d I speak across Ed to Sadie. \u201cAnd because he put himself in the necklace. And because he never painted another portrait, his whole life. People begged him to, but he would always say, \u2018J\u2019ai peint celui que j\u2019ai voulu peinare.\u2019 \u2018I have painted the one I wanted to paint.\u2019 And when you see the painting, you realize why. Because why would he ever want to paint anyone else after Sadie?\u201d My throat is suddenly thick. \u201cShe was the most beautiful thing you ever saw. She was radiant. And she was wearing this necklace... When you see the necklace in the painting, it all makes sense. He loved her. Even if she lived her whole life without knowing it. Even if she lived to one hundred and five without ever getting an answer.\u201d I brush away a tear from my cheek.</p><p>Ed looks lost for words. Which is hardly a surprise. One minute we\u2019re snogging. The next I\u2019m downloading some random torrent of family history on him.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you see the painting? Where is it?\u201d Sadie takes a step toward me, quivering all over, her face pale. \u201cIt was lost. It was burned.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo, did you know your great-aunt well?\u201d Ed is saying simultaneously.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know her when she was alive. But after she died I went down to Archbury, where she used to live. He\u2019s famous.\u201d I turn again to Sadie. \u201cStephen\u2019s famous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFamous?\u201d Sadie looks bewildered.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a whole museum dedicated to him. He\u2019s called Cecil Malory. He was discovered long after his death. And the portrait is famous too. And it was saved and it\u2019s in a gallery and everyone loves it... and you have to see it. You have to see it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNow.\u201d Sadie\u2019s voice is so quiet, I can barely hear her. \u201cPlease. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds awesome,\u201d says Ed politely. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to go see it someday. We could take in some galleries, do lunch-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Now.\u201d I take his hand. \u201cRight now.\u201d I glance at Sadie. \u201cCome on.\u201d</p><p>We sit on the leather bench, the three of us, in a silent row. Sadie next to me. Me next to Ed. Sadie hasn\u2019t spoken since she came into the gallery. When she first saw the portrait, I thought she might faint. She flickered silently and just stared, and then at last exhaled as though she\u2019d been holding her breath for an hour.</p><p>\u201cAmazing eyes,\u201d says Ed at length. He keeps shooting me wary looks, as though he\u2019s not sure how to deal with this situation.</p> <p>\u201cAmazing.\u201d I nod, but I can\u2019t concentrate on him. \u201cAre you OK?\u201d I give Sadie a worried glance. \u201cI know this has been a real shock for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good.\u201d Ed sounds puzzled. \u201cThanks for asking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m all right.\u201d Sadie gives me a wan smile. Then she resumes gazing at the painting. She\u2019s already been up close to it, to see the portrait of Stephen hidden in her necklace, and her face was briefly so contorted with love and sorrow that I had to turn away and give her a moment of privacy.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve done some research at the gallery,\u201d I say to Ed. \u201cShe\u2019s the most popular painting here. They\u2019re going to launch a range of products with her picture on them. Like posters and coffee mugs. She\u2019s going to be famous!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCoffee mugs.\u201d Sadie tosses her head. \u201cHow terribly vulgar.\u201d But I can see a sudden glimmer of pride in her eyes. \u201cWhat else will I be on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd tea towels, jigsaw puzzles...\u201d I say as though informing Ed. \u201cYou name it. If she was ever worried about not making any mark on this world...\u201d I leave my words trailing in the air.</p> <p>\u201cQuite the famous relative you have.\u201d Ed raises his eyebrows. \u201cYour family must be very proud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d I say after a pause. \u201cBut they will be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMabel.\u201d Ed is consulting the guidebook which he insisted on buying at the entrance. \u201cIt says here: The sitter is thought to be called Mabel .</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what they thought.\u201d I nod. \u201cBecause the painting says My Mabel on the back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMabel?\u201d Sadie swivels around, looking so horrified I can\u2019t help snorting with laughter.</p><p>\u201cI told them it was a joke between her and Cecil Malory,\u201d I hastily explain. \u201cIt was her nickname, but everyone thought it was real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I look like a Mabel?\u201d</p><p>A movement attracts my attention and I look up. To my surprise, Malcolm Gledhill is entering the gallery. As he sees me, he gives a sheepish smile and shifts his briefcase from one hand to another.</p> <p>\u201cOh, Miss Lington. Hello. After our conversation today, I just thought I\u2019d come and have another look at her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d I nod. \u201cI\u2019d like to introduce...\u201d Abruptly I realize I\u2019m about to introduce Sadie to him. \u201cEd.\u201d I quickly switch my hand to the other direction. \u201cThis is Ed Harrison. Malcolm Gledhill. He\u2019s in charge of the collection.\u201d</p><p>Malcolm joins the three of us on the bench, and for a moment we all just look at the painting.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve had the painting in the gallery since 1982,\u201d says Ed, still reading the guidebook. \u201cWhy did the family get rid of it? Strange move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood question,\u201d says Sadie, suddenly waking up. \u201cIt belonged to me. Nobody should have been allowed to sell it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood question,\u201d I echo firmly. \u201cIt belonged to Sadie. Nobody should have been allowed to sell it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what I want to know is, who did sell it?\u201d she adds.</p><p>\u201cWho did sell it?\u201d I echo.</p><p>\u201cWho did sell it?\u201d repeats Ed.</p><p>Malcolm Gledhill shifts uncomfortably on the bench.</p><p>\u201cAs I said today, Miss Lington, it was a confidential arrangement.

We deserve to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, let me get this straight.\u201d Ed is finally showing a real interest in the story. \u201cSomeone stole the painting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDunno.\u201d I shrug. \u201cIt was missing for years, and then I found it here. All I know is, it was sold to the gallery in the 1980s, but I don\u2019t know who sold it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know?\u201d Ed turns to Malcolm Gledhill.</p> <p>\u201cI... do.\u201d He nods reluctantly.</p><p>\u201cWell, can\u2019t you tell her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot... well... no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this some official secret?\u201d demands Ed. \u201cDoes it involve weapons of mass destruction? Is national security at stake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot so to speak.\u201d Malcolm looks more flustered than ever. \u201cBut there was a confidentiality clause in the agreement-\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOK.\u201d Ed snaps into his business-consultant, taking-command-of-the-situation mode. \u201cI\u2019ll have an attorney on this in the morning. This is ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely ridiculous,\u201d I chime in, bolstered by Ed\u2019s bullish attitude. \u201cAnd we won\u2019t stand for it. Are you aware my uncle is Bill Lington? I know he will use every resource to fight this... ridiculous confidentiality. It\u2019s our painting.\u201d</p><p>Malcolm Gledhill looks utterly beleaguered.</p><p>\u201cThe agreement clearly states...\u201d he manages at last, then trails off. I can see his eyes constantly flicking toward his briefcase.</p><p>\u201cIs the file in there?\u201d I say, in sudden inspiration.</p><p>\u201cAs it happens, it is,\u201d says Malcolm Gledhill guardedly. \u201cI\u2019m taking the papers home to study. Copies, of course.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo you could show the agreement to us,\u201d says Ed, lowering his voice. \u201cWe won\u2019t snitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could not show you anything!\u201d Malcolm Gledhill nearly falls off the bench in horror. \u201cThat, as I keep repeating, is confidential information.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it is.\u201d I adopt a soothing voice. \u201cWe understand that. But maybe you could do me a small favor and check the date of acquisition? That\u2019s not confidential, is it?\u201d</p><p>Ed gives me a questioning glance, but I pretend I haven\u2019t noticed. Another plan has occurred to me. One which Ed won\u2019t understand.</p><p>\u201cIt was June 1982, as I remember,\u201d says Malcolm Gledhill.</p><p>\u201cBut the exact date? Could you just have a quick look at the agreement?\u201d I open my eyes innocently at him. \u201cPlease? It could be very helpful.\u201d</p><p>Malcolm Gledhill gives me a suspicious look but obviously can\u2019t think of any reason to refuse. He bends down, clicks open his briefcase, and draws out a file of papers.</p><p>I catch Sadie\u2019s eye and jerk my head surreptitiously at Malcolm Gledhill.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she says.</p><p>For God\u2019s sake. And she calls me slow.</p><p>I jerk my head again at Malcolm Gledhill, who is now smoothing out a sheet of paper.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she repeats impatiently. \u201cWhat are you trying to say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere we are.\u201d He puts on a pair of reading glasses. \u201cLet me find the date...\u201d</p><p>My neck\u2019s going to crick if I jerk my head any more. I honestly think I\u2019m going to die of frustration in a minute. There\u2019s the information we want. Right there. Open for anyone to read who happens to be of a ghostly invisible nature. And still Sadie is peering at me uncomprehendingly.</p><p>\u201cLook!\u201d I mutter, out of the corner of my mouth. \u201cLook at it! Look at it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Her face snaps in sudden understanding. A nanosecond later she\u2019s standing behind Malcolm Gledhill, peering over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cLook at what?\u201d says Ed, sounding puzzled, but I barely hear him. I\u2019m avidly watching Sadie as she reads, frowns, gives a small gasp-then looks up.</p><p>\u201cWilliam Lington. He sold it for five hundred thousand pounds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWilliam Lington?\u201d I stare back at her stupidly. \u201cYou mean...

It was Bill who sorted it all out... Strange to imagine, but Bill was the idler in those days .</p><p>It\u2019s all obvious. He must have found the painting all those years ago, realized it was valuable, and sold it to the London Portrait Gallery in a secret agreement.</p><p>\u201cAre you OK?\u201d Ed touches my arm. \u201cLara?\u201d</p><p>But I can\u2019t move. Now my mind is moving in bigger circles. Wilder circles. I\u2019m putting two and two together. I\u2019m putting eight and eight together. And I\u2019m making a hundred million.</p><p>Bill set up Lingtons Coffee in 1982.</p> <p>The same year he secretly made half a million from selling Sadie\u2019s painting.</p><p>And now, finally, finally... it\u2019s all falling into place. It\u2019s all making sense. He had \u00a3500,000 that no one knew about, \u00a3500,000 that he\u2019s never mentioned. Not in any interview. Not in any seminar. Not in any book.</p><p>I feel light-headed. The enormity of this is only slowly sinking in. The whole thing is a lie. The whole world thinks he\u2019s a business genius who started with two little coins. Half a million notes, more like.</p><p>And he covered it up so no one would know. He must have realized the painting was of Sadie as soon as he saw it. He must have realized it belonged to her. But he let the world believe it was some servant called Mabel. He probably fed them that story himself. That way, no one would come knocking on any Lington\u2019s door, asking about the beautiful girl in the painting.</p><p>\u201cLara?\u201d Ed\u2019s waving a hand in front of my face. \u201cSpeak to me. What is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe year 1982.\u201d I look up in a daze. \u201cSound familiar? That\u2019s when Uncle Bill started up Lingtons Coffee. You know? With his famous \u2018Two Little Coins.\u2019\u201d I do quote marks with my fingers. \u201cOr was there, in fact, half a million pounds which started him off? Which he somehow forgot to mention because it wasn\u2019t his in the first place?\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s silence. I can see the pieces falling into place in Ed\u2019s mind.</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ,\u201d he says at last, and looks up at me. \u201cThis is huge. Huge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I swallow. \u201cHuge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo the whole Two Little Coins story, the seminars, the book, the DVD, the movie...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll complete bullshit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I were Pierce Brosnan, I\u2019d be calling my agent right about now.\u201d Ed raises his eyebrows comically.</p><p>I\u2019d want to laugh, too, if I didn\u2019t want to cry. If I wasn\u2019t so sad and furious and sick at what Uncle Bill did.</p><p>That was Sadie\u2019s painting. It was hers to sell or keep. He took it and he used it and he never breathed a word. How dare he? How dare he?</p> <p>With sickening clarity, I can see a parallel universe in which someone else, someone decent like my dad, had found the painting and done the right thing. I can see Sadie sitting in her nursing home, wearing her necklace, looking at her beautiful painting throughout her old age, until the very last light faded from her eyes.</p><p>Or maybe she would have sold it. But it would have been hers to sell. It would have been her glory. I can see her brought out of her nursing home and shown the painting hanging in the London Portrait Gallery. I can see the joy that would have given her. And I can even see her sitting in her chair, having Stephen\u2019s letters read aloud to her by some kind archivist.</p><p>Uncle Bill robbed her of years and years of possible happiness. And I\u2019ll never forgive him.</p><p>\u201cShe should have known.\u201d I can\u2019t contain my anger anymore. \u201cSadie should have known she was hanging up here. She went to her death with no idea. And that was wrong. It was wrong.\u201d</p><p>I glance over at Sadie, who has wandered away from the conversation as though she\u2019s not interested. She shrugs, as though to brush away all my angst and fury.</p><p>\u201cDarling, don\u2019t drone on about it. Too dull. At least I\u2019ve found it now. At least it wasn\u2019t destroyed. And at least I don\u2019t look as fat as I remember,\u201d she adds with sudden animation. \u201cMy arms look rather wonderful, don\u2019t they? I always did have good arms.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cToo twiggy for my taste,\u201d I can\u2019t help shooting back.</p><p>\u201cAt least they\u2019re not pillows.\u201d</p><p>Sadie meets my eyes and we exchange wary smiles. Her bravado doesn\u2019t fool me. She\u2019s pale and flickery, and I can tell this discovery has thrown her. But her chin is up, high and proud as ever.</p><p>Malcolm Gledhill is still looking deeply uncomfortable. \u201cIf we\u2019d realized she was still alive, if anyone had told us-\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t have known,\u201d I say, my anger abated a little. \u201cWe didn\u2019t even know it was her ourselves.\u201d</p><p>Because Uncle Bill didn\u2019t say a word. Because he covered the whole thing up with an anonymous deal. No wonder he wanted the necklace. It was the only thing left linking Sadie to her portrait. It was the only thing which might uncover his massive con trick. This painting must have been a time bomb for him, ticking away quietly all these years. And now, finally, it\u2019s gone off. Boom . I don\u2019t know how yet, but I\u2019m going to avenge Sadie. Big-time.</p><p>All four of us have silently, gradually, turned to face the painting again. It\u2019s almost impossible to sit in this gallery and not end up staring at it.</p><p>\u201cI told you that she\u2019s the most popular painting in the gallery,\u201d says Malcolm Gledhill presently. \u201cI spoke to the marketing department today, and they\u2019re making her the face of the gallery. She\u2019ll be used in every campaign.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to be on a lipstick,\u201d says Sadie, suddenly turning with determination. \u201cA lovely bright lipstick.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe should be on a lipstick,\u201d I say firmly to Malcolm Gledhill. \u201cAnd you should name it after her. That\u2019s what she would have wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see what we can do.\u201d He looks a little flustered. \u201cIt\u2019s not really my area.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let you know what else she would have wanted.\u201d I wink at Sadie. \u201cI\u2019ll be acting as her unofficial agent from now on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wonder what she\u2019s thinking,\u201d says Ed, still gazing up at her. \u201cThat\u2019s quite an intriguing expression she has.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI often wonder that myself,\u201d chimes in Malcolm Gledhill eagerly. \u201cShe seems to have such a look of serenity and happiness... Obviously, from what you\u2019ve said, she had a certain emotional connection with the painter Malory... I often wonder if he was reading her poetry as he painted...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat an idiot this man is,\u201d says Sadie scathingly in my ear. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious what I\u2019m thinking. I\u2019m looking at Stephen and I\u2019m thinking, I want to jump his bones.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe wanted to jump his bones,\u201d I say to Malcolm Gledhill. Ed shoots me a disbelieving look, then bursts into laughter.</p><p>\u201cI should be going.\u201d Malcolm Gledhill has clearly had enough of us for one night. He picks up his briefcase, nods at us, then swiftly walks away. A few seconds later I can hear him practically running down the marble stairs. I look at Ed and grin.</p><p>\u201cSorry about the diversion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d He gives me a quizzical look. \u201cSo... any other old masters you want to unveil tonight? Any long-lost family sculptures? Any more psychic revelations? Or shall we go get some dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDinner.\u201d I stand up and look at Sadie. She\u2019s still sitting there, her feet up on the bench and her yellow dress flowing around her, gazing up at her twenty-three-year-old self as though she wants to drink herself in. \u201cComing?\u201d I say softly.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d says Ed.</p><p>\u201cNot quite yet,\u201d says Sadie, without moving her head. \u201cYou go. I\u2019ll see you later.\u201d</p><p>I follow Ed to the exit, then turn and give Sadie one last anxious look. I just want to make sure she\u2019s OK. But she doesn\u2019t even notice me. She\u2019s still transfixed. Like she wants to sit there all night with the painting. Like she wants to make up for all the time she lost.</p> <p>Like, finally, she\u2019s found what she was looking for.</p><p>TWENTY-FIVE</p><p>I\u2019ve never avenged anyone before. And I\u2019m finding it a lot trickier than I expected. Uncle Bill is abroad and no one can get in contact with him. (Well, of course they can get hold of him. They\u2019re just not going to do so for the crazy stalker niece.) I don\u2019t want to write to him or make a phone call. This has to be done face-to-face. So at the moment, it\u2019s impossible.</p><p>And it\u2019s not helped by Sadie going all moral-high-ground on me. She thinks there\u2019s no point dwelling on the past, and what\u2019s done is done, and I should stop \u201cdroning on about it, darling.\u201d</p><p>But I don\u2019t care what she thinks. Vengeance will be mine. The more I think about what Uncle Bill did, the more livid I am, and the more I want to phone up Dad and blurt it all out. But somehow I\u2019m keeping control. There\u2019s no rush. Everyone knows revenge is a dish best served when you\u2019ve had enough time to build up enough vitriol and fury. Plus, it\u2019s not like my evidence is going anywhere. The painting is hardly going to disappear from the London Portrait Gallery. Nor is the so-called confidential agreement that Uncle Bill signed all those years ago. Ed\u2019s already hired a lawyer for me, and he\u2019s going to start formal claim proceedings as soon I give him the say-so. Which I\u2019m going to do as soon as I\u2019ve confronted Uncle Bill myself and seen him squirm. That\u2019s my aim. If he grovels it\u2019ll be the icing on the cake, but I\u2019m not that hopeful. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I heave a sigh, screw up a piece of paper, and throw it into the bin. I want to see him squirm now . I\u2019ve honed my vengeance speech and everything.</p><p>To distract myself, I lean against the headboard of my bed and flick through the post. My bedroom is actually a pretty good office. I don\u2019t have to commute, and it doesn\u2019t cost anything. And it has a bed in it. On the less positive side, Kate has to work at my dressing table and keeps getting her legs wedged underneath it.</p><p>I\u2019m calling my new headhunting company Magic Search, and we\u2019ve been running for three weeks now. And we\u2019ve already landed a commission! We were recommended to a pharmaceuticals company by Janet Grady, who is my new best friend. (She\u2019s not stupid, Janet. She knows I did all the work and Natalie did nothing. Mostly because I rang her up and told her.) I did the pitch myself, and two days ago we heard we\u2019d won! We\u2019ve been asked to compile a short list for another marketing director job, and this one has to have specialist knowledge of the pharmaceuticals industry. I told the HR head that this was a perfect job for us, because, by chance, one of my associates has intimate personal knowledge of the pharmaceuticals industry.</p><p>Which, OK, isn\u2019t strictly true.</p> <p>But the point about Sadie is she\u2019s a very quick learner and has all sorts of clever ideas. Which is why she\u2019s a valued member of the Magic Search team.</p><p>\u201cHello!\u201d Her high-pitched voice jolts me out of my reverie, and I look up to see her sitting at the end of my bed. \u201cI\u2019ve just been to Glaxo Wellcome. I\u2019ve got the direct lines of two of the senior marketing team. Quick, before I forget...\u201d</p><p>She dictates two names and telephone numbers to me. Private, direct-line numbers. Gold dust to a headhunter.</p><p>\u201cThe second one has just had a baby,\u201d she adds. \u201cSo he probably doesn\u2019t want a new job. But Rick Young might. He looked pretty bored during their meeting. When I go back I\u2019ll find out his salary somehow.\u201d</p><p>Sadie , I write underneath the phone numbers, you\u2019re a star. Thanks a million .</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t mention it,\u201d she says crisply. \u201cIt was too easy. Where next? We should think about Europe, you know. There must be simply heaps of talent in Switzerland and France.\u201d</p><p>Brilliant idea , I write, then look up. \u201cKate, could you make a list of all the major pharmaceuticals companies in Europe for me? I think we might spread our net quite wide with this one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea, Lara,\u201d says Kate, looking impressed. \u201cI\u2019ll get on it.\u201d</p><p>Sadie winks at me and I grin back. Having a job really suits her. She looks more alive and happy these days than I\u2019ve ever known her. I\u2019ve even given her a job title: chief headhunter. After all, she\u2019s the one doing the hunting.</p><p>She\u2019s found us an office too: a run-down building off Kilburn High Road. We can move in there next week. It\u2019s all falling into place.</p><p>Every evening, after Kate goes home, Sadie and I sit on my bed together and talk. Or, rather, she talks. I\u2019ve told her that I want to know about her. I want to hear about everything she can remember, whether it\u2019s big, small, important, trivial-everything. And so she sits there, and plays with her beads, and thinks for a bit, and tells me things. Her thoughts are a bit random and I can\u2019t always follow, but gradually a picture of her life has built up. She\u2019s told me about the divine hat she was wearing in Hong Kong when war was declared, the leather trunk she packed everything in and lost, the boat journey she made to the United States, the time she was robbed at gunpoint in Chicago but managed to keep hold of her necklace, the man she danced with one night who later became president...</p> <p>And I sit totally riveted. I\u2019ve never heard a story like it. She\u2019s had the most amazing, colorful life. Sometimes fun, sometimes exciting, sometimes desperate, sometimes shocking. It\u2019s a life I can\u2019t imagine anyone else leading. Only Sadie.</p><p>I talk a bit too. I\u2019ve told her about growing up with Mum and Dad, stories about Tonya\u2019s riding lessons and my synchronized-swimming craze. I\u2019ve told her about Mum\u2019s anxiety attacks and how I wish she could relax and enjoy life. I\u2019ve told her how our whole lives we\u2019ve been in the shadow of Uncle Bill.</p><p>We don\u2019t really comment on each other\u2019s stories. We just listen.</p><p>Then, later on, when I go to bed, Sadie goes to the London Portrait Gallery and sits with her painting all night, alone. She hasn\u2019t told me that\u2019s what she does. I just know, from the way she disappears off silently, her eyes already distant and dreamy. And the way she returns, thoughtful and distracted and talking about her childhood and Stephen and Archbury. I\u2019m glad she goes. The painting\u2019s so important to her, she should spend time with it. And this way she doesn\u2019t have to share it with anyone else. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Coincidentally, it works out well for me too, her being out of the way at night. For... various other reasons.</p><p>Nothing specific.</p><p>Oh, OK. All right . There is a specific reason. Which would be the fact that Ed has recently stayed over at my place a few nights.</p><p>I mean, come on. Can you think of anything worse than a ghost lurking around in your bedroom when you\u2019re... getting to know your new boyfriend better? The idea of Sadie giving us a running commentary is more than I can cope with. And she has no shame. I know she\u2019d watch us. She\u2019d probably award us points out of ten, or say disparagingly that they did it much better in her day, or suddenly yell \u201cFaster!\u201d in Ed\u2019s ear.</p> <p>I\u2019ve already caught her stepping into the shower one morning when Ed and I both happened to be in there. I screamed and tried to push her out, and accidentally elbowed Ed in the face, and it took me about an hour to recover. And Sadie wasn\u2019t one little bit sorry. She said I was overreacting and she just wanted to keep us company. Company?</p><p>Ed kept shooting me little sidelong glances after that. It\u2019s almost like he suspects. I mean, obviously he can\u2019t have guessed the truth; that would be impossible. But he\u2019s pretty observant. And I can tell he knows there\u2019s something a bit strange in my life.</p><p>The phone rings and Kate picks it up. \u201cHello, Magic Search, can I help you?... Oh. Yes, of course, I\u2019ll put you through.\u201d She presses the hold button and says, \u201cIt\u2019s Sam from Bill Lington\u2019s travel office. Apparently you called them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. Thanks, Kate.\u201d</p><p>I take a deep breath and pick up the receiver. Here goes my latest salvo.</p> <p>\u201cHello, Sam,\u201d I say pleasantly. \u201cThanks for ringing back. The reason I called is, um... I\u2019m trying to arrange a fun surprise for my uncle. I know he\u2019s away and I wondered if you could possibly give me his flight details? Obviously I won\u2019t pass them on!\u201d I add, with a casual little laugh.</p><p>This is a total bluff. I don\u2019t even know if he\u2019s flying back from wherever he is. Maybe he\u2019s taking the QE2 or traveling by bespoke submarine. Nothing would surprise me.</p><p>\u201cLara,\u201d Sam sighs. \u201cI\u2019ve just spoken to Sarah. She told me that you were trying to contact Bill. She also informed me that you\u2019d been banned from the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBanned?\u201d I muster tones of shock. \u201cAre you serious? Well, I have no idea what that\u2019s about. I\u2019m just trying to organize a little surprise birthday-o-gram for my uncle-\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis birthday was a month ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo... I\u2019m a bit late!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLara, I can\u2019t give out confidential flight information,\u201d Sam says smoothly. \u201cOr any information. Sorry. Have a good day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Well... thanks.\u201d I crash the receiver down. Damn.</p><p>\u201cEverything OK?\u201d Kate looks up anxiously.</p><p>\u201cYes. Fine.\u201d I muster a smile. But as I head out to the kitchen, I\u2019m breathing heavily and my blood is pumping around fast, all toxic with frustration. I\u2019m sure this situation is terrible for my health. Another thing to blame Uncle Bill for. I flick on the kettle and lean against the counter, trying to calm myself with deep breathing.</p><p>Hare hare... vengeance will be mine... hare hare... I just have to be patient...</p><p>Trouble is, I\u2019m sick of being patient. I take a teaspoon out and shove the drawer closed with a satisfying bang .</p><p>\u201cGoodness!\u201d Sadie appears, perched above the dishwasher. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what\u2019s wrong.\u201d I haul my tea bag out roughly and dump it in the bin. \u201cI want to get him.\u201d</p> <p>Sadie opens her eyes wider. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize you were so steamed up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t. But I am now. I\u2019ve had enough.\u201d I slosh milk into my tea and dump the carton back in the fridge. \u201cI know you\u2019re being all magnanimous, but I don\u2019t see how you can do it. I just want to... to punch him. Every time I pass a Lingtons coffee shop, I see a great big rack with Two Little Coins for sale. I want to rush in and yell, \u2018Stop it, everybody! It wasn\u2019t two little coins! It was my great-aunt\u2019s fortune!\u2019\u201d I sigh and take a sip of tea. Then I look up at Sadie curiously. \u201cDon\u2019t you want to get back at him? You must be a total saint.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSaint is probably a little strong...\u201d She smoothes back her hair.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not. You\u2019re amazing.\u201d I cradle the mug. \u201cThe way you just keep moving forward. The way you don\u2019t dwell on stuff. The way you look at the big picture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep moving onward,\u201d she says simply. \u201cThat\u2019s always been my way.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell, I really admire you.

But would I be a better person?\u201d She hits her slim chest. \u201cWould I feel better inside?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe south of France?\u201d I stare at her, puzzled. \u201cWhat do you mean, the south of France?\u201d</p><p>Sadie immediately looks shifty. \u201cI\u2019m... guessing.

Come on. What did you do to him? You might as well tell me now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did nothing!\u201d she says haughtily. \u201cOr at least... nothing much. I just wanted to have a look at him. He\u2019s very, very rich, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIncredibly.\u201d I nod. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe seems to own an entire beach. That\u2019s where I came across him. He was lying on a bed in the sun, covered in oil, with several servants nearby cooking food for him. He looked terribly self-satisfied.\u201d A rictus of distaste passes across her face.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you want to yell at him? Didn\u2019t you want to have a go at him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually... I did yell at him,\u201d she says after a pause. \u201cI couldn\u2019t help myself. I felt so angry.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s good! You should yell. What did you say?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m utterly agog. I can\u2019t believe Sadie has gone and confronted Uncle Bill on his private beach, all on her own. To be honest, I feel a bit hurt that she left me out. But then, I guess she has the right to seek revenge in any way she wants. And I\u2019m glad she let him have it. I hope he heard every word.</p><p>\u201cCome on, what did you say?\u201d I persist. \u201cTell me word for word, starting at the beginning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told him he was fat,\u201d she says with satisfaction.</p><p>For a moment I think I must have heard wrong.</p><p>\u201cYou told him he was fat?\u201d I stare at her incredulously. \u201cThat was it? That was your revenge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the perfect revenge!\u201d retorts Sadie. \u201cHe looked very unhappy. He\u2019s a terribly vain man, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I think we can do better than that,\u201d I say decisively, putting my mug down. \u201cHere\u2019s the plan, Sadie. You\u2019re going to tell me where I need to book a flight to. And we\u2019re going to get on a plane tomorrow. And you\u2019re going to take me to where he is. OK?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOK.\u201d Her eyes suddenly brighten. \u201cIt\u2019ll be like a holiday!\u201d</p><p>Sadie has taken the holiday theme seriously. A little too seriously, if you ask me. She\u2019s dressed for our trip in a backless flowing outfit made out of orange silky stuff, which she calls \u201cbeach pajamas.\u201d She has on a massive straw hat, is clutching a parasol and a wicker basket, and keeps humming some song about being \u201csur la plage.\u201d She\u2019s in such a chipper mood I almost want to snap at her that this is serious business and can she please stop twirling the ribbons on her hat? But then, it\u2019s OK for her. She\u2019s already seen Uncle Bill. She\u2019s yelled at him. She\u2019s released her tension. I\u2019ve still got mine, coiled up inside me. I haven\u2019t mellowed. I haven\u2019t got distance. I want him to pay. I want him to suffer. I want him to-</p><p>\u201cMore champagne?\u201d A smiling air hostess appears at my side.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I hesitate, then hold out my glass. \u201cEr... OK, then. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>Traveling with Sadie is an experience unlike any other. She shrieked at the passengers at the airport and we found ourselves ushered to the head of the queue. Then she shrieked at the check-in girl and I found myself upgraded. And now the hostesses keep plying me with champagne! (Mind you, I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s because of Sadie or because of being in a posh seat.)</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t this fun?\u201d Sadie slides into the seat next to me and eyes my champagne longingly.</p><p>\u201cYeah, great,\u201d I murmur, pretending to be talking into a Dictaphone.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Ed?\u201d She manages to get about ten insinuating tones into one syllable. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFine, thanks,\u201d I say lightly. \u201cHe thinks I\u2019m having a reunion with an old school friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know he\u2019s told his mother about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I turn toward her. \u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI happened to be passing his office the other night,\u201d Sadie says airily. \u201cSo I thought I\u2019d pop in, and he was on the phone. I just happened to catch a few snatches of his conversation.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSadie,\u201d I hiss. \u201cWere you spying on him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said London was working out really well for him.\u201d Sadie ignores my question. \u201cAnd then he said he\u2019d met someone who made him glad that Corinne did what she did. He said he couldn\u2019t have imagined it and he hadn\u2019t been looking for it-but it had happened. And his mother told him she was so thrilled and she couldn\u2019t wait to meet you, and he said, \u2018Slow down, Mom.\u2019 But he was laughing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Well... he\u2019s right. We\u2019d better not rush things.\u201d I\u2019m trying to sound all nonchalant, but secretly I have a glow of pleasure inside. Ed told his mother about me!</p><p>\u201cAnd aren\u2019t you glad you didn\u2019t stay with Josh?\u201d Sadie suddenly demands. \u201cAren\u2019t you glad I saved you from that hideous fate?\u201d</p><p>I take a sip of champagne, avoiding her eye, having a slight internal struggle. To be honest, going out with Ed after Josh is like moving onto Duchy Originals super-tasty seeded loaf after plastic white bread. (I don\u2019t mean to be rude about Josh. And I didn\u2019t realize it at the time. But it is. He is. Plastic white bread.)</p> <p>So really I should be truthful and say, \u201cYes, Sadie, I\u2019m glad you saved me from that hideous fate.\u201d Except then she\u2019ll become so conceited I won\u2019t be able to stand it.</p><p>\u201cLife takes us on different paths,\u201d I say at last, cryptically. \u201cIt\u2019s not up to us to evaluate or judge them, merely respect and embrace them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat drivel,\u201d she says contemptuously. \u201cI know I saved you from a hideous fate, and if you can\u2019t even be grateful-\u201d She\u2019s suddenly distracted by the sight out of the window. \u201cLook! We\u2019re nearly there!\u201d</p><p>Sure enough, a moment later the seat-belt signs come on and everyone buckles up-apart from Sadie, who is floating around the cabin.</p><p>\u201cHis mother is quite stylish, you know,\u201d she says conversationally.</p><p>\u201cWhose mother?\u201d I\u2019m not following.</p> <p>\u201cEd\u2019s, of course. I think you and she would get on well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d I say in puzzlement.</p><p>\u201cI went to see what she was like, of course,\u201d she says carelessly. \u201cThey live outside Boston. Very nice house. She was having a bath. She has a very good figure for a woman of her age-\u201d</p><p>\u201cSadie, stop!\u201d I\u2019m almost too incredulous to speak. \u201cYou can\u2019t do this! You can\u2019t go around spying on everyone in my life!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I can,\u201d she says, opening her eyes wide as though it\u2019s obvious. \u201cI\u2019m your guardian angel. It\u2019s my job to watch out for you.\u201d</p><p>I stare back at her, flummoxed. The plane engines begin to roar as we start our descent, my ears begin to pop, and there\u2019s a slight heaving in my stomach.</p><p>\u201cI hate this bit.\u201d Sadie wrinkles her nose. \u201cSee you there.\u201d And before I can say anything else, she disappears.</p><p>Uncle Bill\u2019s mansion is a longish taxi ride from Nice Airport. I stop for a glass of Orangina in the village caf\u00e9 and practice my schoolgirl French on the owner, to Sadie\u2019s great amusement. Then we get back in the taxi and head the final stretch to Uncle Bill\u2019s villa. Or complex. Or whatever you call a massive white house with several other houses dotted around the grounds and a mini-vineyard and a helicopter pad.</p> <p>The place is staffed pretty heavily, but that doesn\u2019t matter when you have a French-speaking ghost by your side. Every member of staff we come across is soon turned into a glassy-eyed statue. We make our way through the garden without being challenged, and Sadie leads me swiftly to a cliff, into which steps are cut, with a balustrade. At the bottom of the steps is a sandy beach and, beyond that, endless Mediterranean.</p><p>So this is what you get if you\u2019re the owner of Lingtons Coffee. Your own beach. Your own view. Your own slice of sea. Suddenly I can see the point of being immensely rich.</p><p>For a moment I just stand shading my eyes from the glare of the sun, watching Uncle Bill. I\u2019d pictured him relaxing on a sun lounger, surveying his empire, maybe stroking a white cat with one evil hand. But he\u2019s not surveying anything, or relaxing. In fact, he\u2019s not looking as I imagined him at all. He\u2019s with a personal trainer, doing sit-ups and sweating profusely. I gape, astonished, as he does crunch after crunch, almost howling with pain, then collapses on his exercise mat. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGive... me... a... moment...\u201d he gasps. \u201cThen another hundred.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s so engrossed, he doesn\u2019t notice as I quietly make my way down the cliff steps, accompanied by Sadie.</p><p>\u201cPer\u2019aps you should rest now?\u201d says the trainer, looking concerned as he surveys Uncle Bill. \u201cYou \u2019ave \u2019ad a good workout.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still need to work on my abs,\u201d says Uncle Bill grimly, clutching his sides in dissatisfaction. \u201cI need to lose some fat.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMeester Leengton.\u201d The trainer looks totally bemused. \u201cYou \u2019ave no fat to lose. \u2019ow many times must I tell you thees?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you do!\u201d I jump as Sadie whirls through the air to Uncle Bill. \u201cYou\u2019re fat!\u201d she shrieks in his ear. \u201cFat, fat, fat! You\u2019re gross!\u201d</p><p>Uncle Bill\u2019s face jolts with alarm. Looking desperate, he sinks to the mat again and starts doing more crunches, groaning with the effort.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d says Sadie, floating about his head and looking down with disdain. \u201cSuffer. You deserve it.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help giggling. Hats off to her. This is a brilliant revenge. We watch him wincing and panting a while longer, then Sadie advances again.</p> <p>\u201cNow tell your servant to go!\u201d she yells in his ear, and Uncle Bill pauses mid-crunch.</p><p>\u201cYou can go now, Jean-Michel,\u201d he says breathlessly. \u201cSee you this evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d The trainer gathers up all his pieces of equipment, brushing the sand off them. \u201cI see you at six.\u201d</p><p>He heads up the cliff steps, nodding politely as he passes me, and heads toward the house.</p><p>OK. So now it\u2019s my turn. I take a deep breath of warm Mediterranean air and start to walk down the rest of the cliff steps. My hands are damp as I reach the beach. I take a few steps over the hot sand, then just stand still, waiting for Uncle Bill to notice me.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s...\u201d He suddenly catches a glimpse of me as he comes down onto the mat. Immediately he sits up again and swivels around. He looks utterly stupefied and slightly ill. I\u2019m not surprised, after doing 59,000 sit-ups. \u201cIs that... Lara? What are you doing here? How did you get here?\u201d</p> <p>He looks so dazed and drained, I almost feel sorry for him. But I\u2019m not going to let myself. Nor am I going to be drawn into small talk. I have a speech to make and I\u2019m going to make it.</p><p>\u201cYes, it is I,\u201d I say, in the most imposing, chilling voice I can muster. \u201cLara Alexandra Lington. Daughter to a betrayed father. Great-niece to a betrayed great-aunt. Niece to a betraying, evil, lying uncle. And I will have my vengeance.\u201d That bit was so satisfying to say, I repeat it, my voice ringing across the beach. \u201cAnd I will have my vengeance!\u201d</p><p>God, I would have loved to be a movie star.</p><p>\u201cLara.\u201d Uncle Bill has stopped panting by now and almost regained control of himself. He wipes his face and pulls a towel around his waist. Then he turns and smiles at me with that old suave, patronizing air. \u201cVery stirring stuff. But I have no idea what you\u2019re talking about, nor how you got past my guards-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what I\u2019m talking about,\u201d I say scathingly. \u201cYou know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid I have no idea.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s silence except for the waves washing onto the beach. The sun seems to be beating even more intensely than before. Neither of us has moved.</p><p>So he\u2019s calling my bluff. He must think he\u2019s safe. He must think that the anonymous agreement protects him and no one will ever be able to find out.</p> <p>\u201cIs this about the necklace?\u201d Uncle Bill says suddenly, as though the thought has just struck him. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty trinket, and I can understand your interest in it. But I don\u2019t know where it is. Believe me. Now, did your father tell you, I want to offer you a job? Is that why you\u2019re here? Because you certainly get marks for keenness, young lady.\u201d</p><p>He flashes his teeth at me and slides on a pair of black flip-flops. He\u2019s turning the situation. Any minute now he\u2019ll be ordering drinks and somehow pretending this visit was all his idea. Trying to buy me, trying to distract me, trying to turn everything his own way. Just like he\u2019s done all these years.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not here about the necklace, or the job.\u201d My voice cuts across his. \u201cI\u2019m here about Great-Aunt Sadie.\u201d</p><p>Uncle Bill raises his eyes to heaven with a familiar exasperation. \u201cJesus Christ, Lara. Will you give it a rest? For the last time, love, she wasn\u2019t murdered, she wasn\u2019t anything special-\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the painting of her that you found,\u201d I carry on coolly. \u201cThe Cecil Malory. And the anonymous deal you did with the London Portrait Gallery in 1982. And the five hundred thousand pounds you got. And all the lies you told. And what you\u2019re going to do about it. That\u2019s why I\u2019m here.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And I watch in satisfaction as my uncle\u2019s face sags like I\u2019ve never seen it before. Like butter melting away under the sun.</p><p>TWENTY-SIX</p><p>It\u2019s a sensation. It\u2019s front-page news in every paper. Every paper.</p><p>Bill \u201cTwo Little Coins\u201d Lington has \u201cclarified\u201d his story. The big, one-to-one interview was in the Mail, and all the papers jumped on it immediately.</p> <p>He\u2019s come clean about the five hundred thousand. Except, of course, being Uncle Bill, he went on at once to claim that the money was only part of the story. And that his business principles could still be applied to anyone starting out with two little coins. And so actually the story isn\u2019t that different and, in a sense, half a million is the same as two little coins, it\u2019s simply the quantity that\u2019s different. (Then he realized he was on to a loser there and backtracked, but too late-it was out of his mouth.)</p><p>For me, the money really isn\u2019t the point. It\u2019s that finally, after all this time, he\u2019s credited Sadie. He\u2019s told the world about her instead of denying her and hiding her away. The quote that most of the papers used is: \u201cI couldn\u2019t have achieved my success without my beautiful aunt, Sadie Lancaster, and I\u2019ll always be indebted to her.\u201d Which I dictated to him, word for word.</p><p>Sadie\u2019s portrait has been on every single front cover. The London Portrait Gallery has been besieged. She\u2019s like the new Mona Lisa . Only better, because the painting\u2019s so massive there\u2019s room for loads of people to look at her at once. (And she\u2019s way prettier. I\u2019m just saying.) We\u2019ve gone back there a few times ourselves, just to see the crowds and hear all the nice things they say about her. She\u2019s even got a fan site on the Internet.</p><p>As for Uncle Bill\u2019s book, he can say all he likes about business principles, but it won\u2019t do any good. Two Little Coins has become the biggest object of ridicule since the Millennium Dome. It\u2019s been parodied in all the tabloids, every single comedian has made a joke about it on television, and the publishers are so embarrassed, they\u2019re offering money back on it. About twenty percent of people have taken up the offer, apparently. I guess the others want to keep it as a souvenir, or put it on the mantelpiece and laugh at it, or something.</p><p>I\u2019m flicking through an editorial about him in today\u2019s Mail when my phone bleeps with a text: Hi I\u2019m outside. Ed .</p> <p>This is one of the many good things about Ed. He\u2019s never late. Happily, I grab my bag, bang the flat door shut, and head down the stairs. Kate and I are moving in to our new office today, and Ed\u2019s promised to come and see it on his way to work. As I arrive on the pavement, there he is, holding a massive bunch of red roses.</p><p>\u201cFor the office,\u201d he says, presenting them to me with a kiss.</p><p>\u201cThanks!\u201d I beam. \u201cEveryone will be staring at me on the tube.\u201d I stop in surprise as Ed puts a hand on my arm.</p><p>\u201cI thought we could take my car today,\u201d he says conversationally.</p><p>\u201cYour car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d He nods at a smart black Aston Martin parked nearby.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s yours?\u201d I goggle at it in disbelief. \u201cBut... but... how?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBought it. You know, car showroom... credit card... usual process... Thought I\u2019d better buy British,\u201d he adds with a wry smile.</p><p>He bought an Aston Martin? Just like that?</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019ve never driven on the left.\u201d I feel a sudden alarm. \u201cHave you been driving that thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelax. I took the test last week. Boy, you have a fucked-up system.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo we don\u2019t,\u201d I begin automatically.</p><p>\u201cStick shifts are the work of the devil. And don\u2019t even get me started on your right turn rules.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t believe this. He\u2019s kept this totally quiet. He never mentioned cars, or driving... or anything.</p> <p>\u201cBut... why?\u201d I can\u2019t help blurting out.</p><p>\u201cSomeone told me once,\u201d he says thoughtfully, \u201cif you\u2019re going to live in a country, for however long, you should engage with it. And what better way to engage than learning how to drive in that country? Now, you want a ride or not?\u201d</p><p>He opens the door with a gallant gesture. Still flabbergasted, I slide into the passenger seat. This is a seriously smart car. In fact, I don\u2019t dare put my roses down in case they scratch the leather.</p><p>\u201cI learned all the British curses too,\u201d Ed adds as he pulls out into the road. \u201cGet a move on, you nobhead!\u201d He puts on a Cockney accent, and I can\u2019t help giggling.</p><p>\u201cVery good.\u201d I nod. \u201cWhat about \u2018That\u2019s right out of order, you wanker!\u2019\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI was told \u2018Bang out of order, you wanker,\u2019\u201d says Ed. \u201cWas I misinformed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s OK too. But you need to work on the accent.\u201d I watch as he changes gear efficiently and cruises past a red bus. \u201cBut I don\u2019t understand. This is a really expensive car. What will you do with it when-\u201d I stop myself before I can say any more, and cough feebly.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Ed may be driving, but he\u2019s as alert as ever.</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d I lower my chin until my face is practically nestling in the rose bouquet. \u201cNothing.\u201d</p> <p>I was going to say, \u201cwhen you go back to the States.\u201d But that\u2019s something we just don\u2019t talk about.</p><p>There\u2019s silence-then Ed shoots me a cryptic look. \u201cWho knows what I\u2019ll do?\u201d</p><p>The tour of the office doesn\u2019t take that long. In fact, we\u2019re pretty much done by 9:05 a.m. Ed looks at everything twice and says it\u2019s all great, and gives me a list of contacts who might be helpful, then has to leave for his own office. And then, about an hour later, just as I\u2019m elbow deep in rose stems and water and a hastily bought vase, Mum and Dad arrive, also bearing flowers, and a bottle of champagne, and a new box of paper clips, which is Dad\u2019s little joke.</p><p>And even though I\u2019ve only just showed the place to Ed, and even though it\u2019s just a room with a window and a pin board and two doors and two desks... I can\u2019t help feeling a buzz as I lead them around. It\u2019s mine. My space. My company.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s very smart.\u201d Mum peers out of the window. \u201cBut, darling, are you sure you can afford it? Wouldn\u2019t you have been better off staying with Natalie?\u201d</p> <p>Honestly. How many times do you have to explain to your parents that your former best friend is an obnoxious, unscrupulous total liability for them to believe you?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m better off on my own, Mum, honestly. Look, this is my business plan...\u201d</p><p>I hand them the document, which is bound and numbered and looks so smart I can hardly believe I put it together. Every time I read it I feel a fierce thrill, mixed with yearning. If I make a success of Magic Search, my life will be complete.</p><p>I said that to Sadie this morning as we were reading yet more articles about her in the paper. She was silent for a moment, then to my surprise she stood up with a weird light in her eye and said, \u201cI\u2019m your guardian angel! I should make it a success.\u201d And then she disappeared. So I have a sneaky feeling she\u2019s up to something. As long as it doesn\u2019t involve any more blind dates.</p><p>\u201cVery impressive!\u201d says Dad, flipping through the plan.</p><p>\u201cI got some advice from Ed,\u201d I confess. \u201cHe\u2019s been really helpful with all the Uncle Bill stuff too. He helped me do that statement. And he was the one who said we should hire a publicist to manage the press. Did you see the Mail piece today, by the way?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAh, yes,\u201d says Dad faintly, exchanging looks with Mum. \u201cWe did.\u201d</p><p>To say my parents are gobsmacked by everything that\u2019s happened recently would be an understatement. I\u2019ve never seen them so poleaxed as I when I rocked up at the front door, told them Uncle Bill wanted to have a word, turned back to the limo, and said, \u201cOK, in you go,\u201d with a jerk of my thumb. And Uncle Bill got out of the car silently, with a set jaw, and did everything I said.</p><p>Neither of my parents could manage a word. It was as though sausages had suddenly started growing out of my head. Even after Uncle Bill had gone and I said, \u201cAny questions?\u201d they didn\u2019t speak. They just sat on the sofa, staring at me in a kind of stupefied awe. Even now, when they\u2019ve thawed a little and the whole story is out and it\u2019s not such a shock anymore, they still keep darting me looks of awe.</p><p>Well. Why shouldn\u2019t they? I have been pretty awesome, though I say so myself. I masterminded the whole press expos\u00e9, together with Ed\u2019s help, and it\u2019s gone perfectly. At least, perfectly from my point of view. Maybe not from Uncle Bill\u2019s point of view. Or Aunt Trudy\u2019s. The day the story broke, she flew to a spa in Arizona and checked in indefinitely. God knows if we\u2019ll ever see her again.</p><p>Diamant\u00e9, on the other hand, has totally cashed in on it. She\u2019s already done a photoshoot for Tatler with a mock-up of Sadie\u2019s painting, and she\u2019s using the whole story to publicize her fashion label. Which is really, really tacky. And also quite smart. I can\u2019t help admiring her chutzpah. I mean, it\u2019s not her fault her dad is such a tosser, is it?</p><p>I secretly wish Diamant\u00e9 and Great-Aunt Sadie could meet. I think they\u2019d get on. They\u2019ve got a lot in common, even though they\u2019d each probably be horrified at that idea. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLara.\u201d I look up to see Dad approaching me.

Obviously once the police were sure she hadn\u2019t been...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMurdered,\u201d puts in Mum.</p><p>\u201cQuite. Once the file was closed, the police released her... that\u2019s to say...\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemains,\u201d says Mum in a whisper.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t done it yet.\u201d I feel a bolt of panic. \u201cPlease tell me you haven\u2019t had her funeral.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no! It was provisionally set for this Friday. We were planning to tell you at some stage...\u201d He trails off evasively.</p> <p>Yeah, right.</p><p>\u201cAnyway!\u201d says Mum quickly. \u201cThat was before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuite. Obviously things have somewhat changed now,\u201d Dad continues. \u201cSo if you would like to be involved in planning it-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I would like to be involved,\u201d I say, almost fiercely. \u201cIn fact, I think I\u2019ll take charge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Dad glances at Mum. \u201cWell. Absolutely. I think that would only be right, given the amount of... of research you\u2019ve done on her life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe do think you\u2019re a marvel, Lara,\u201d says Mum with a sudden fervor. \u201cFinding all this out. Who would have known, without you? The story might never have come out at all! We might all have gone to our deaths, never knowing the truth!\u201d</p> <p>Trust Mum to bring all our deaths into it.</p><p>\u201cHere are the funeral directors\u2019 details, darling.\u201d Dad hands me a leaflet, and I awkwardly pocket it, just as the buzzer goes. I head to the video intercom and peer at the grainy black-and-white image on the little screen. I think it\u2019s a man, although the image is so crap, it could equally well be an elephant.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Gareth Birch from Print Please,\u201d says the man. \u201cI\u2019ve got your business cards here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, cool! Bring them up!\u201d</p><p>This is it. Now I know I really have a business. I have business cards!</p><p>I usher Gareth Birch into our office, excitedly open the box, and hand cards around to everyone. They say Lara Lington, Magic Search, and there\u2019s a little embossed picture of a tiny magic wand.</p><p>\u201cHow come you delivered them personally?\u201d I ask as I sign the delivery form. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s very kind, but aren\u2019t you based in Hackney? Weren\u2019t you going to send them by post?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d do you a favor,\u201d Gareth Birch says, giving me a glassy stare. \u201cI value your business greatly, and it\u2019s the least I can do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I stare at him, puzzled.</p><p>\u201cI value your business greatly,\u201d he repeats, sounding a bit robotic. \u201cIt\u2019s the least I can do.\u201d</p><p>Oh my God. Sadie. What\u2019s she been doing?</p><p>\u201cWell... thanks very much,\u201d I say, feeling a bit embarrassed. \u201cI appreciate it. And I\u2019ll recommend you to all my friends!\u201d</p><p>Gareth Birch makes his exit and I busy myself unpacking the boxes of cards, aware of Mum and Dad looking at me, agog.</p><p>\u201cDid he just bring these himself, all the way from Hackney?\u201d says Dad at last.</p><p>\u201cLooks like it.\u201d I try to sound breezy, as though this is a normal course of events. Luckily, before they can say anything else, the phone rings and I hurry to answer it.</p><p>\u201cHello, Magic Search.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay I speak to Lara Lington, please?\u201d It\u2019s a woman\u2019s voice I don\u2019t recognize.</p><p>\u201cSpeaking.\u201d I sit down on one of the new swivel chairs, hoping she doesn\u2019t hear the crunch of plastic. \u201cCan I help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is Pauline Reed. I\u2019m head of human resources at Wheeler Foods. I was wondering, would you like to come in for a chat? I\u2019ve heard good things about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, how nice!\u201d I beam over the phone. \u201cFrom whom, may I ask? Janet Grady?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s silence. When Pauline Reed speaks again, she sounds puzzled.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t quite recall who. But you have a great reputation for sourcing talent, and I want to meet you. Something tells me you can do good things for our business.\u201d</p><p>Sadie .</p><p>\u201cWell... that would be great!\u201d I gather my wits. \u201cLet me look at my schedule...\u201d I open it and fix up an appointment. As I put the phone down, both Mum and Dad are watching with a kind of eager hopefulness.</p><p>\u201cGood news, darling?\u201d says Dad. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJust the head of human resources at Wheeler Foods,\u201d I say casually. \u201cShe wanted a meeting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWheeler Foods who make Oatie Breakfast Treats?\u201d Mum sounds beside herself.</p><p>\u201cYup.\u201d I can\u2019t help beaming. \u201cLooks like my guardian angel\u2019s watching out for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello!\u201d Kate\u2019s bright voice interrupts me as she bursts through the door, holding a big flower arrangement. \u201cLook what\u2019s just been delivered! Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Lington,\u201d she adds politely. \u201cDo you like our new office? Isn\u2019t it great?\u201d</p> <p>I take the flower arrangement from Kate and rip open the little card.</p><p>\u201cTo all at Magic Search,\u201d I read aloud. \u201c We hope to get to know you as clients and as friends. Yours, Brian Chalmers. Head of Global Human Resources at Dwyer Dunbar plc . And he\u2019s given his private line number.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow amazing!\u201d Kate\u2019s eyes are wide. \u201cDo you know him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know anyone at Dwyer Dunbar?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEr... no.\u201d</p><p>Mum and Dad both seem beyond speech. I think I\u2019d better get them out of here before anything else crazy happens.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to lunch at the pizza place,\u201d I inform Kate. \u201cWant to come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be along in a sec.\u201d She nods cheerfully. \u201cI need to sort a few things out first.\u201d</p><p>I usher Mum and Dad out of the office, down the steps, and onto the street. An elderly vicar in a clerical collar and robes is standing directly outside on the pavement, looking a bit lost, and I approach him, wondering if he\u2019s OK.</p><p>\u201cHi. Do you know where you are? Can I give you directions?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell... yes, I am a stranger to the area.\u201d He gives me a dazed look. \u201cI\u2019m looking for number 59.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s this building-look.\u201d I point to our foyer, where 59 is embossed on the glass.</p><p>\u201cAh, yes, so it is!\u201d His face clears and he approaches the entrance. But to my surprise he doesn\u2019t go in. He just raises his hand and starts making the sign of the cross.</p><p>\u201cLord, I call on you to bless all who work in this building,\u201d he says, his voice a little quavery. \u201cBless all endeavors and businesses within, particularly at this time Magic-\u201d</p><p>No way .</p><p>\u201cSo!\u201d I grab Mum and Dad. \u201cLet\u2019s go and get some pizza.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLara,\u201d says Dad weakly, as I practically manhandle him down the street. \u201cAm I going mad, or was that vicar-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll have Four Seasons,\u201d I interrupt him brightly. \u201cAnd some dough balls. How about you two?\u201d</p> <p>I think Mum and Dad have given up. They\u2019re just going with the flow. By the time we\u2019ve all had a glass of valpolicella, everyone\u2019s smiling and the tricky questions have stopped. We\u2019ve all chosen our pizzas and are stuffing in hot, garlicky dough balls, and I\u2019m feeling pretty happy.</p><p>Even when Tonya arrives, I can\u2019t get stressed. It was Mum and Dad\u2019s idea to ask her along, and the truth is, even though she winds me up, she\u2019s family. I\u2019m starting to appreciate what that means.</p><p>\u201cOh my God.\u201d Her strident greeting rings through the restaurant, and about twenty heads turn. \u201cOh my God. Can you believe all this stuff about Uncle Bill?\u201d</p><p>As she arrives at our table, she\u2019s obviously expecting a bit more of a reaction.</p><p>\u201cHi, Tonya,\u201d I say. \u201cHow are the boys? How\u2019s Stuart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you believe it?\u201d she repeats, giving us all dissatisfied looks. \u201cHave you seen the papers? I mean, it can\u2019t be true. It\u2019s tabloid rubbish. Someone\u2019s got an agenda somewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it is true,\u201d Dad corrects her mildly. \u201cI think he admits as much himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut have you seen what they\u2019ve written about him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Mum reaches for the valpolicella. \u201cWe have. Wine, darling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d Tonya sinks down into a chair and looks around at us all with an aggrieved, bewildered expression. She clearly thought we would all be up in arms on Uncle Bill\u2019s behalf. Not merrily tucking into dough balls.</p><p>\u201cHere you are.\u201d Mum slides a wineglass across. \u201cWe\u2019ll get you a menu.\u201d</p><p>I can see Tonya\u2019s mind working as she unbuttons her jacket and slings it over a chair. I can see her recalibrating the situation. She\u2019s not going to stick up for Uncle Bill if no one else does.</p><p>\u201cSo, who uncovered it all?\u201d she says at last, and takes a gulp of wine. \u201cSome investigative journalist?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLara,\u201d says Dad with a little smile. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLara?\u201d She looks more resentful than ever. \u201cWhat do you mean, Lara?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI found out about Great-Aunt Sadie and the picture,\u201d I explain. \u201cI put two and two together. It was me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d Tonya\u2019s cheeks are puffing out in disbelief. \u201cBut you weren\u2019t mentioned in the papers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI prefer to keep a low profile,\u201d I say cryptically, like a superhero who vanishes namelessly into the darkness and doesn\u2019t need any reward other than doing good.</p> <p>Although, truth be told, I would have loved to be mentioned in the papers. But no one bothered to come and interview me, even though I straightened my hair especially, just in case. All the reports just said, The discovery was made by a family member .</p><p>Family member . Hmph.</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t get it.\u201d Tonya\u2019s baleful blue eyes are on me. \u201cWhy did you start poking around in the first place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had an instinct something was wrong regarding Great-Aunt Sadie. But no one would listen to me,\u201d I can\u2019t help adding pointedly. \u201cAt the funeral, everyone thought I was a nutcase.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said she\u2019d been murdered,\u201d objects Tonya. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t murdered.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI had a general instinct that something was amiss,\u201d I say with a dignified air. \u201cSo I chose to follow up my suspicions on my own. And, after some research, they were confirmed.\u201d Everyone\u2019s hanging on my words as if I\u2019m a university lecturer. \u201cI then approached experts at the London Portrait Gallery, and they verified my discovery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed they did.\u201d Dad smiles at me.</p><p>\u201cAnd guess what?\u201d I add proudly. \u201cThey\u2019re having the painting valued and Uncle Bill\u2019s giving Dad half of what it\u2019s worth!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way.\u201d Tonya claps a hand to her mouth. \u201cNo way . How much will that be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMillions, apparently.\u201d Dad looks uncomfortable. \u201cBill\u2019s adamant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only what you\u2019re owed, Dad,\u201d I say for the millionth time. \u201cHe stole it from you. He\u2019s a thief!\u201d</p> <p>Tonya seems a bit speechless. She takes a dough ball and rips it with her teeth.</p><p>\u201cDid you see that editorial in The Times?\u201d she says at last. \u201cBrutal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was rather savage.\u201d Dad winces. \u201cWe do feel for Bill, despite it all-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we don\u2019t!\u201d Mum interrupts. \u201cSpeak for yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPippa!\u201d Dad looks taken aback.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t feel for him one little bit.\u201d She looks around the table defiantly. \u201cI feel... angry. Yes. Angry.\u201d</p><p>I gape at Mum in surprise. My whole life, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever known Mum to actually say she was angry. Across the table, Tonya looks just as gobsmacked. She raises her eyebrows questioningly at me, and I give a tiny shrug in return.</p><p>\u201cWhat he did was shameful and unforgivable,\u201d Mum continues. \u201cYour father always tries to see the good side of people, to find the excuse. But sometimes there isn\u2019t a good side. There isn\u2019t an excuse.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019ve never known Mum so militant. Her cheeks are pink and she\u2019s clutching her wineglass as though she\u2019s about to punch the sky with it.</p><p>\u201cGood for you, Mum!\u201d I exclaim.</p><p>\u201cAnd if your father keeps trying to defend him-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not defending him!\u201d says Dad at once. \u201cBut he\u2019s my brother. He\u2019s family. It\u2019s difficult...\u201d</p><p>He sighs heavily. I can see the disappointment etched in the lines under his eyes. Dad wants to find the good in everyone. It\u2019s part of his makeup.</p><p>\u201cYour brother\u2019s success cast a long shadow over our family.\u201d Mum\u2019s voice is trembling. \u201cIt affected all of us in different ways. Now it\u2019s time for us all to be free. That\u2019s what I think. Draw a line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI recommended Uncle Bill\u2019s book to my book club, you know,\u201d says Tonya suddenly. \u201cI made eight sales for him.\u201d She looks almost more outraged by this than anything. \u201cAnd it was all lies! He\u2019s despicable!\u201d She turns on Dad. \u201cAnd if you don\u2019t think so, too, Dad, if you don\u2019t feel livid with him, then you\u2019re a mug!\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help giving an inward cheer. Sometimes Tonya\u2019s forthright, trampling-over-feet way is just what you need.</p><p>\u201cI am livid,\u201d Dad says at last. \u201cOf course I am. It\u2019s just an adjustment. To realize your younger brother is quite such a selfish... unprincipled... shit.\u201d He breathes out hard. \u201cI mean, what does that say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt says we forget about him,\u201d says Mum firmly. \u201cMove on.

His name\u2019s Ed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery handsome,\u201d puts in Dad supportively.</p><p>\u201cHe took us all out for lunch last week!\u201d adds Mum.</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d Tonya looks affronted. \u201cThat\u2019s... great. But it\u2019ll be hard when he goes back to the States, won\u2019t it?\u201d She visibly brightens. \u201cLong-distance relationships are the most likely to break down. All those transatlantic phone calls... and the time difference...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho knows what\u2019ll happen?\u201d I hear myself saying sweetly.</p> <p>\u201cI can make him stay!\u201d Sadie\u2019s low voice in my ear makes me jump. I turn to see her hovering right by me, her eyes shining with determination. \u201cI\u2019m your guardian angel. I\u2019ll make Ed stay in England!\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me a moment,\u201d I say to the table generally. \u201cI\u2019ve just got to send a text.\u201d</p><p>I get out my phone and start texting, positioning the screen so that Sadie can see it.</p><p>It\u2019s OK. U don\u2019t need to make him stay. Where have u been?</p><p>\u201cOr I could make him ask you to marry him!\u201d she exclaims, ignoring my question. \u201cToo much fun! I\u2019ll tell him to propose, and I\u2019ll make sure he chooses a simply stunning ring, and we\u2019ll have such fun planning the wedding...\u201d</p><p>No, no, no! I text hurriedly. Sadie, stop! Don\u2019t make Ed do anything. I want him to make his own decisions. I want him to listen to his own voice .</p><p>Sadie gives a little harrumph as she reads my message. \u201cWell, I think my voice is more interesting,\u201d she says, and I can\u2019t help a smile.</p><p>\u201cTexting your boyfriend?\u201d says Tonya, watching me.</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say noncommittally. \u201cJust... a friend. A good friend.\u201d I turn away and tap in, Thanks for doing all that stuff to help me. U didn\u2019t have to .</p><p>\u201cI wanted to!\u201d says Sadie. \u201cIt\u2019s fun! Have you had the champagne yet?\u201d</p><p>No , I text back, wanting to laugh. Sadie, u r the best guardian angel EVER .</p><p>\u201cWell, I do rather pride myself.\u201d She preens herself. \u201cNow, where shall I sit?\u201d</p><p>She floats across the table and sits on a spare chair at the end, just as Kate approaches the table, looking pink with excitement.</p><p>\u201cGuess what!\u201d she says. \u201cWe just got a bottle of champagne from the off-license round the corner! The man said it was to welcome us to the area! And you\u2019ve had lots of calls, Lara; I\u2019ve written down all the numbers... and the post arrived, forwarded from your flat. I didn\u2019t bring it all, but there was one package I thought might be important; it\u2019s come from Paris...\u201d She hands me a Jiffy bag, pulls out a chair, and beams at everyone. \u201cHave you ordered yet? I\u2019m absolutely starving! Hi, we haven\u2019t met, I\u2019m Kate...\u201d</p><p>As Kate and Tonya introduce themselves and Dad pours out more wine, I stare down at the Jiffy bag, feeling a sudden breathless apprehension. It\u2019s come from Paris. It has girlish handwriting on the front. When I press it, I can feel something hard and bumpy inside. Hard and bumpy like a necklace.</p><p>Slowly, I lift my eyes. Sadie is watching me intently across the table. I know she\u2019s thinking the same. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGo on.\u201d She nods.</p><p>With trembling hands I rip it open. I peer inside at a mass of tissue paper. I push it aside and see a flash of pale iridescent yellow. I look up, straight at Sadie.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it, isn\u2019t it?\u201d She\u2019s gone very white. \u201cYou\u2019ve got it.\u201d</p><p>I nod, just once. Then, barely knowing what I\u2019m doing, I push back my chair.</p> <p>\u201cI just have to... make a call.\u201d My voice is suddenly grainy. \u201cI\u2019ll go outside. Be back in a moment...\u201d</p><p>I thread my way through the tables and chairs to the back of the restaurant, where there\u2019s a small secluded courtyard. I push my way out through the fire doors and head to the far corner, then open the Jiffy bag again, pull out the mass of tissue paper, and gently unwrap it.</p><p>After all this time. I\u2019m holding it. Just like that.</p><p>It\u2019s warmer to the touch than I expected. More substantial, somehow. A shaft of sunlight is glinting off the rhinestones, and the beads are shimmering. It\u2019s so stunning I have a sudden strong urge to put it on. But instead I look up at Sadie, who has been watching me silently.</p><p>\u201cHere you are. It\u2019s yours.\u201d Automatically I try to put it around her neck, as though I\u2019m giving her an Olympic medal. But my hands sink straight through her. I try again and again, even though I know it\u2019s no use.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do!\u201d I\u2019m half laughing, half perilously near tears. \u201cIt\u2019s yours! You should be wearing it! We need the ghost version-\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d Sadie\u2019s voice rises in sudden tension. \u201cDon\u2019t...\u201d She breaks off and moves away from me, her eyes fixed on the paving slabs of the courtyard. \u201cYou know what you have to do.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s silence apart from the steady roar of Kilburn traffic coming from the main road. I can\u2019t look at Sadie. I\u2019m just standing clutching the necklace. I know this is what we\u2019ve been chasing and hunting and wishing for. But now we have it... I don\u2019t want to have arrived here. Not yet. The necklace is the reason Sadie\u2019s been haunting me. When she gets it back-</p><p>My thoughts abruptly veer away. I don\u2019t want to think about that. I don\u2019t want to think about any of it.</p><p>A breeze rustles some leaves on the ground, and Sadie looks up, pale and resolute.</p><p>\u201cGive me some time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d I swallow. \u201cSure.\u201d I stuff the necklace into the bag and head back into the restaurant. Sadie has already disappeared.</p><p>I can\u2019t eat my pizza. I can\u2019t make proper conversation. I can\u2019t focus when I get back to the office, even though six more calls come in from blue-chip HR managers wanting to set up meetings with me. The Jiffy bag is on my lap; my hand is clutching the necklace tightly inside it and I can\u2019t let go.</p><p>I text Ed, saying I have a headache and need to be alone. When I get home, there\u2019s no Sadie, which doesn\u2019t surprise me. I make some supper, which I don\u2019t eat, then sit in bed with the necklace around my neck, twisting the beads and watching old movies on TCM and not even bothering to try to sleep. At last, at about five-thirty, I get up, put on some clothes, and head out. The soft gray of the dawn is tinged with a vivid pink-red sunrise. I stand still, gazing at the red streaks in the sky for a few moments, and in spite of everything feel my spirits lifting. Then I buy a coffee from a caf\u00e9, get on a bus, and head to Waterloo, staring blankly out as the bus trundles through the streets. By the time I arrive it\u2019s nearer six-thirty. People are starting to appear on the bridge and in the streets. The London Portrait Gallery is still shut up, though. Locked and empty; not a soul inside. That\u2019s what you\u2019d think, anyway.</p><p>I find a nearby wall, sit down, and sip my coffee, which is lukewarm but delicious on an empty stomach. I\u2019m prepared to sit there all day, but as a nearby church bell strikes eight, she appears on the steps, that dreamy look on her face again. She\u2019s wearing yet another amazing dress, this one in pearl gray with a tulle skirt cut in petal shapes. A gray cloche is pulled down over her head, and her eyes are lowered. I don\u2019t want to alarm her, so I wait until she notices me and starts in surprise.</p><p>\u201cLara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d I lift a hand. \u201cThought you\u2019d be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s my necklace?\u201d Her voice is sharp with alarm. \u201cHave you lost it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ve got it. It\u2019s OK. It\u2019s right here. Look.\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s no one around, but I glance right and left, just in case. Then I pull out the necklace. In the clear morning light, it looks more spectacular than ever. I let it run over my hands and the beads click gently together. She gazes down at it lovingly, puts out her hands as though to take it, then draws them back. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI wish I could touch it,\u201d she murmurs.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Helplessly, I hold it out to her, as though presenting an offering.

Today?\u201d</p> <p>Sadie meets my eyes. \u201cRight now.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a sudden blocking in my throat. I can\u2019t say any of the things I want to say. I think she knows what they are, anyway.</p><p>\u201cI want it back,\u201d she repeats, softly but firmly. \u201cI\u2019ve been too long without it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d I nod several times, my fingers clutching the necklace so hard I think they might bruise. \u201cWell, then, you need to have it.\u201d</p><p>The journey is too short. The taxi is slipping through the early-morning streets too effortlessly. I want to tell the driver to slow down. I want time to stand still. I want the taxi to be caught in a jam for six hours... But all of a sudden we\u2019re drawing up in the little suburban street. We\u2019ve arrived.</p> <p>\u201cWell, that was quick, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d Sadie\u2019s voice is resolutely bright.</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d I force a smile. \u201cAmazingly quick.\u201d</p><p>As we get out of the taxi, I feel dread clasping my chest like iron. My hand is locked around the necklace so hard, I\u2019m getting cramps in my fingers. But I can\u2019t bring myself to loosen my grasp, even as I\u2019m struggling to pay the driver with the other hand.</p><p>The taxi roars away, and Sadie and I look at each other. We\u2019re standing opposite a small row of shops, one of which is a funeral parlor.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it there.\u201d I point redundantly at the sign saying Chapel of Rest . \u201cLooks like it\u2019s closed.\u201d</p><p>Sadie has drifted up to the firmly locked door and is peering in the window.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019d better wait, I suppose.\u201d She shrugs and returns to my side. \u201cWe can sit here.\u201d</p><p>She sits down beside me on a wooden bench, and for a moment we\u2019re both silent. I glance at my watch. Eight fifty-five. They open up shop at nine. Just the thought gives me a rush of panic, so I won\u2019t think about it. Not yet. I\u2019ll just focus on the fact that I\u2019m sitting here with Sadie.</p><p>\u201cNice dress, by the way.\u201d I think I sound fairly normal. \u201cWho did you pinch that one from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one,\u201d says Sadie, sounding offended. \u201cIt was mine.\u201d She runs her eyes over me, then says grudgingly, \u201cYour shoes are pretty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I want to smile, but my mouth won\u2019t quite do it. \u201cI bought them the other day. Ed helped me choose them, actually. We were late-night shopping. We went to the Whiteleys center. They had all these special offers on...\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m saying, I\u2019m just talking for the sake of it. Because talking is better than waiting. I glance at my watch again and it\u2019s two minutes past the hour. They\u2019re late. I feel ridiculously grateful, like we\u2019ve been given a reprieve.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s rather good at the old bone-jumping, isn\u2019t he?\u201d Sadie suddenly says conversationally. \u201cEd, I mean. Mind you... you\u2019re not so bad either.\u201d</p><p>Bone-jumping?</p> <p>She doesn\u2019t mean-</p><p>No. No .</p><p>\u201cSadie.\u201d I turn on her. \u201cI knew it! You watched us!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She bursts into peals of laughter. \u201cI was very subtle! You didn\u2019t know I was there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you see?\u201d I moan.</p><p>\u201cEverything,\u201d she says airily. \u201cAnd it was a jolly good show, I can tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSadie, you\u2019re impossible!\u201d I clutch my head. \u201cYou don\u2019t watch people having sex! There are laws against that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just had one tiny criticism,\u201d she says, ignoring me. \u201cOr, rather... suggestion. Something we used to do in my day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I say in horror. \u201cNo suggestions!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour loss.\u201d She shrugs and examines her nails, occasionally shooting me a look from under her lashes.</p><p>Oh for God\u2019s sake. Of course, now my curiosity is piqued. I want to know what her suggestion is.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d I say at last. \u201cTell me your genius 1920s sex tip. But it better not involve any weird indelible paste.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...\u201d Sadie begins, coming closer. But before she can continue, my eyes suddenly focus over her shoulder. I stiffen and draw breath. An elderly man in an overcoat is unlocking the door of the funeral parlor.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Sadie follows my gaze. \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I swallow.</p><p>By now the elderly man has caught sight of me. I suppose I am quite noticeable, sitting bolt upright on a bench staring directly at him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAre you... all right?\u201d he says warily.</p><p>\u201cUm... hi.\u201d I force myself to my feet. \u201cI\u2019m actually...

For a moment I can\u2019t quite move. I want to prolong this moment of limbo. I want to stop us doing this. If I don\u2019t acknowledge it, maybe it\u2019s not really going to happen.</p> <p>\u201cGot the necklace?\u201d comes Sadie\u2019s voice beside me.</p><p>\u201cRight here.\u201d I pull it out of my bag.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d She smiles, but it\u2019s a tense, remote smile.

It\u2019s on her mind too.</p><p>\u201cWhat d\u2019you think will happen when I... when...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you mean, will you finally be rid of me?\u201d says Sadie, as flippantly as ever.</p><p>\u201cNo! I just meant-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. You\u2019re in a tearing hurry to get rid of me. Sick of the sight of me.\u201d Her chin is quivering but she flashes me a smile. \u201cWell, I shouldn\u2019t think it\u2019ll work for a moment.\u201d</p> <p>Her eyes meet mine, and I can see the message in them. Don\u2019t lose it. No wallowing.

I swivel around, breathing hard, determined that I won\u2019t lose it, I won\u2019t let her down.</p><p>\u201cBut... just in case. Just in case we...\u201d I can\u2019t bring myself to say it.

Nothing can describe what it\u2019s been like to know Sadie.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she whispers, and her eyes are like two glittering stars. \u201cMe too. Go on.\u201d</p><p>When I reach the door of the funeral parlor I look back one last time. She\u2019s sitting bolt upright with perfect posture, her neck as long and pale as ever, her dress skimming her slender frame. She\u2019s facing directly ahead, feet lined up neatly, with her hands clasped on her knees. Utterly still. As though she\u2019s waiting.</p><p>I can\u2019t imagine what\u2019s going through her mind.</p><p>As I stand there, she notices me watching her, lifts her chin, and gives a sudden, ravishing, defiant smile.</p><p>\u201cTally-ho!\u201d she exclaims.</p><p>\u201cTally-ho,\u201d I call back.

I want to put something in the... coffin. Will that be all right? Will it be safe?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAaah. Quite safe, I assure you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd private,\u201d I say fiercely. \u201cI don\u2019t want anyone else going in here after me. If they want to, you contact me first, OK?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAaah.\u201d He surveys his shoes respectfully. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell. Thank you. I\u2019ll... go in now.\u201d</p><p>I walk in, close the door behind me, and just stand there for a few moments. Now that I\u2019m in here, now that I\u2019m actually doing this, my legs feel a bit watery. I swallow a few times, trying to get a grip on myself, telling myself not to freak out. After about a minute I make myself take a step toward the big wooden coffin. Then another.</p><p>That\u2019s Sadie. Real Sadie. My 105-year-old great-aunt. Who lived and died and I never knew her. I edge forward, breathing heavily. As I reach forward, I see just a puff of dry white hair and a glimpse of dried-out old skin.</p> <p>\u201cHere you are, Sadie,\u201d I murmur. Gently, carefully, I slip the necklace around her neck. I\u2019ve done it.</p><p>At last. I\u2019ve done it.</p><p>She looks so tiny and shriveled. So vulnerable. All the times I wanted to touch Sadie, I\u2019m thinking. The times I tried to squeeze her arm or give her a hug... and now here she is. Real flesh. Cautiously, I stroke her hair and pull her dress straight, wishing beyond anything she could feel my touch. This frail, ancient, tiny crumbling body was Sadie\u2019s home for 105 years. This was really her.</p><p>As I stand there I\u2019m trying to keep my breathing steady; I\u2019m trying to think peaceful, suitable thoughts. Maybe even a couple of words to say aloud. I want to do the right thing. But at the same time there\u2019s an urgency beating inside me, growing stronger with every moment I stay here. The truth is, my heart isn\u2019t in this room.</p><p>I have to go. Now.</p><p>With trembling legs I reach the door, wrench the handle, and hurtle out, to the obvious surprise of the funeral director, who\u2019s loitering in the corridor.</p><p>\u201cIs everything all right?\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d I gulp, already walking away. \u201cAll fine. Thank you so much. I\u2019ll be in touch. But I must go now. I\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s rather important...\u201d</p> <p>My chest feels so constricted I can barely breathe. My head is throbbing with thoughts I don\u2019t want to have. I have to get out of here. Somehow I make it down the pastel corridor and through the foyer, almost running. I reach the entrance and burst out onto the street. And I stop dead, clutching the door, panting slightly, looking straight across the road.</p><p>The bench is empty.</p><p>I know right then.</p><p>Of course I know.</p><p>But still my legs take me across the road at a run. I look desperately up and down the pavement. I call out \u201cSadie? SADIE?\u201d until I\u2019m hoarse. I brush tears from my eyes and bat away inquiries from kindly strangers and look up and down the street again, and I won\u2019t give up and at last I sit down on the bench, gripping it with both hands. Just in case. And I wait.</p><p>And when it\u2019s finally dusk and I\u2019m starting to shiver... I know. Deep down, where it matters.</p><p>She\u2019s not coming back. She\u2019s moved on.</p><p>TWENTY-SEVEN</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen.\u201d My voice booms so loudly, I stop and clear my throat. I\u2019ve never spoken into such a big loudspeaker system, and even though I did a \u201cHello, Wembley, one-two, one-two\u201d sound check earlier, it\u2019s still a bit of a shock.</p><p>\u201cLadies and gentlemen.\u201d I try again. \u201cThank you so much for being here today at this occasion of sadness, celebration, festivity...\u201d I survey the mass of faces gazing up at me expectantly. Rows and rows of them. Filling the pews of St. Botolph\u2019s Church. \u201c... and, above all, appreciation of an extraordinary woman who has touched us all.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I turn to glance at the massive reproduction of Sadie\u2019s painting which is dominating the church. Around and beneath it are the most beautiful flower arrangements I\u2019ve ever seen, with lilies and orchids and trailing ivy and even a reproduction of Sadie\u2019s dragonfly necklace, made out of the palest yellow roses set on a bed of moss.</p><p>That one was done by Hawkes and Cox, which is a top London florist. They contacted me when they heard about the memorial service and offered to do it for free, because they were all such fans of Sadie and wanted to show their appreciation of her. (Or, to be more cynical, because they knew they\u2019d get great publicity.)</p><p>I honestly didn\u2019t intend this event to be such a massive deal at first. I just wanted to organize a memorial service for Sadie. But then Malcolm at the London Portrait Gallery heard about it. He suggested they announce the details of the service on their website for any art lovers who wanted to come and pay their respects to such a famous icon. To everyone\u2019s astonishment, they were besieged by applications. In the end they had to do a ballot. It even made the London Tonight news. And here they all are, crammed in. Rows and rows of them. People who want to honor Sadie. When I arrived and saw the crowds, I actually felt a bit breathless.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d also like to say, great clothes. Bravo.\u201d I beam around at the vintage coats, the beaded scarves, the occasional pair of spats. \u201cI think Sadie would have approved.\u201d</p> <p>The dress code for today is 1920s, and everyone has made a stab at it of some sort. And I don\u2019t care if memorial services don\u2019t usually have dress codes, like that vicar kept saying. Sadie would have loved it, and that\u2019s what counts.</p><p>All the nurses from the Fairside Home have made a spectacular effort, both with themselves and also with all the elderly residents who have come. They\u2019re in the most fabulous outfits, with headdresses and necklaces, every single one. I meet Ginny\u2019s eye and she beams, giving an encouraging wave of her fan.</p><p>It was Ginny and a couple of other nurses from the home who came with me to Sadie\u2019s private funeral and cremation, a few weeks ago. I only wanted people there who had known her. Really known her. It was very quiet and heartfelt, and afterward I took them all out for lunch and we cried and drank wine and told Sadie stories and laughed, and then I gave a big donation to the nursing home and they all started crying again.</p><p>Mum and Dad weren\u2019t invited. But I think they kind of understood.</p><p>I glance at them, sitting in the front row. Mum is in a disastrous lilac drop-waisted dress with a headband, which looks more seventies ABBA than twenties. And Dad\u2019s in a totally non-1920s outfit. It\u2019s just a normal, modern single-breasted suit, with a silk spotted handkerchief in his top pocket. But I\u2019ll forgive him, because he\u2019s gazing up at me with such warmth and pride and affection.</p> <p>\u201cThose of you who only know Sadie as a girl in a portrait may wonder, who was the person behind the painting? Well, she was an amazing woman. She was sharp, funny, brave, outrageous... and she treated life as the most massive adventure. As you all know, she was muse to one of the famous painters of this century. She bewitched him. He never stopped loving her, nor she him. They were tragically separated by circumstances. But if he\u2019d only lived longer... who knows?\u201d</p><p>I pause for breath and glance at Mum and Dad, who are watching me, riveted. I practiced my whole speech for them last night, and Dad kept saying incredulously, \u201cHow do you know all this?\u201d I had to start referring vaguely to \u201carchives\u201d and \u201cold letters\u201d just to keep him quiet.</p><p>\u201cShe was uncompromising and feisty. She had this knack of... making things happen. Both to her and to other people.\u201d I sneak a tiny glance at Ed, sitting next to Mum, and he winks back at me. He knows this speech pretty well too.</p><p>\u201cShe lived \u2019til one hundred and five, which is quite an achievement.\u201d I look around the audience to make sure everyone is listening. \u201cBut she would have hated it if this had defined her, if people just thought of her as \u2018the hundred-and-five-year-old.\u2019 Because inside, she was a twenty-three-year-old all her life. A girl who lived her life with sizzle. A girl who loved the Charleston, cocktails, shaking her booty in nightclubs and fountains, driving too fast, lipstick, smoking gaspers... and barney-mugging.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m taking a chance that no one in the audience knows what barney-mugging means. Sure enough, they smile back politely, as though I\u2019ve said she loved flower arranging.</p><p>\u201cShe loathed knitting,\u201d I add, with emphasis. \u201cThat should go on the record. But she loved Grazia.\u201d There\u2019s a laugh around the church, which is good. I wanted there to be laughter.</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOf course, for us, her family,\u201d I continue, \u201cshe wasn\u2019t just a nameless girl in a painting. She was my great-aunt. She was part of our heritage.\u201d I hesitate as I reach the part I really want to hit home. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to discount family. It\u2019s easy to take them for granted. But your family is your history. Your family is part of who you are. And without Sadie, none of us would be in the position we are today.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help shooting Uncle Bill a steely gaze at this point. He\u2019s sitting upright next to Dad, dressed in a bespoke suit with a carnation buttonhole, his face quite a lot gaunter than it was on that beach in the south of France. It hasn\u2019t been a great month for him, all told. He\u2019s been constantly in the news pages and the business pages, and none of it good.</p><p>At first, I wanted to ban him from this altogether. His publicist was desperate for him to come, to try to redress some of the bad PR he\u2019s had, but I couldn\u2019t bear the idea of him swaggering in, stealing the limelight, doing his usual Uncle Bill trick. But then I reconsidered. I started thinking, why shouldn\u2019t he come and honor Sadie? Why shouldn\u2019t he come and listen to how great his aunt was?</p><p>So he was allowed to come. On my terms.</p> <p>\u201cWe should honor her. We should be grateful.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help looking meaningfully at Uncle Bill again-and I\u2019m not the only one. Everyone keeps glancing at him, and there are even a few nudges and whispers going on.</p><p>\u201cWhich is why I\u2019ve set up, in Sadie\u2019s memory, the Sadie Lancaster Foundation. Funds raised will be distributed by the trustees to causes of which she would have approved. In particular, we will be supporting various dance-related organizations, charities for the elderly, the Fairside Nursing Home, and the London Portrait Gallery, in recognition of its having kept her precious painting so safely these last twenty-seven years.\u201d</p><p>I grin at Malcolm Gledhill, who beams back. He was so chuffed when I told him. He went all pink and started talking about whether I\u2019d like to become a Friend, or go on the board, or something, as I\u2019m clearly such an art lover. (I didn\u2019t want to say, \u201cActually, I\u2019m just a Sadie lover; you can pretty much take or leave all those other pictures.\u201d)</p><p>\u201cI would also like to announce that my uncle, Bill Lington, wishes to make the following tribute to Sadie, which I will now read on his behalf.\u201d</p> <p>There is no way on earth I was letting Uncle Bill get up on this podium. Or write his own tribute. He doesn\u2019t even know what I\u2019m about to say. I unfold a separate piece of paper and let a hush of anticipation fall before I begin.</p><p>\u201cIt is entirely due to my aunt Sadie\u2019s painting that I was able to launch myself in business. Without her beauty, without her help, I would not find myself in the privileged position I occupy today. During her life I did not appreciate her enough. And for this I am truly sorry.\u201d I pause for effect. The church is totally silent and agog. I can see all the journalists scribbling hard. \u201cI am therefore delighted to announce today that I will be donating ten million pounds to the Sadie Lancaster Foundation. It is a small recompense, to a very special person.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a stunned murmuring. Uncle Bill has gone a kind of sallow putty color, with a rictus smile fixed in place. I glance at Ed, who winks again and gives me the thumbs-up. It was Ed who said, \u201cGo for ten million.\u201d I was all set to ask for five, and I thought that was pushy enough. And the great thing is, now that six hundred people and a whole row of journalists have heard him, he can\u2019t exactly back out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d sincerely like to thank you all for coming.\u201d I look around the church. \u201cSadie was in a nursing home by the time her painting was discovered. She never knew quite how appreciated and loved she was. She would have been overwhelmed to see you all. She would have realized...\u201d I feel a sudden rush of tears to my head.</p><p>No. I can\u2019t lose it now. After I\u2019ve done so well. Somehow I manage a smile, and draw breath again.</p><p>\u201cShe would have realized what a mark she made on this world. She\u2019s given so many people pleasure, and her legacy will remain for generations. As her great-niece, I\u2019m incredibly proud.\u201d I swivel to survey the painting for a silent moment, then turn back. \u201cNow it simply remains for me to say: To Sadie. If you would all raise your glasses...\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s a stirring and rustling and clinking as everyone reaches for their cocktail glasses. Each guest was presented with a cocktail as they arrived: a gin fizz or a sidecar, especially mixed by two barmen from the Hilton. (And I don\u2019t care if people don\u2019t usually have cocktails at memorial services.)</p><p>\u201cTally-ho.\u201d I lift my glass high, and everyone obediently echoes, \u201cTally-ho.\u201d There\u2019s silence as everyone sips. Then, gradually, murmurs and giggles start to echo round the church. I can see Mum sipping at her sidecar with a wary expression, and Uncle Bill grimly downing his gin fizz in one, and a pink-faced Malcolm Gledhill beckoning the waiter over for a top-up. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The organ crashes in with the opening bars of \u201cJerusalem,\u201d and I make my way down the podium steps to rejoin Ed, who\u2019s standing next to my parents. He\u2019s wearing the most amazing vintage 1920s dinner jacket which he paid a fortune for at a Sotheby\u2019s auction and makes him look like a black-and-white-movie star. When I exclaimed in horror at the price, he just shrugged and said he knew the 1920s thing meant a lot to me.</p><p>\u201cGood job,\u201d he whispers, clenching my hand. \u201cYou did her proud.\u201d</p><p>As the rousing song starts, I realize I can\u2019t join in. Somehow my throat feels too tight and the words won\u2019t come. So instead I look around at the flower-laden church, and the beautiful outfits, and all the people gathered here, singing lustily for Sadie. So many diverse people, from different walks of life. Young, old, family members, friends from the nursing home-people that she touched in some way. All here. All for her. This is what she deserved.</p><p>This is what she deserved. All along.</p> <p>When the service finally ends, the organist launches into the Charleston (I don\u2019t care if memorial services don\u2019t usually have the Charleston), and the congregation slowly files out, still clutching their cocktail glasses. The reception is being held at the London Portrait Gallery, thanks to lovely Malcolm Gledhill, and helpful girls with badges are telling people how to get there.</p><p>But I don\u2019t rush. I can\u2019t quite face all the talking and chatter and buzz. Not just yet. I sit in my front pew, breathing in the scent of the flowers, waiting until it\u2019s quieter.</p><p>I did her justice. At least I think I did. I hope I did.</p><p>\u201cDarling.\u201d Mum\u2019s voice interrupts me and I see her approaching me, her hairband more wonky than ever. Her cheeks are flushed and there\u2019s a glow of pleasure all around her as she slides in beside me. \u201cThat was wonderful. Wonderful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I smile up at her.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m so proud of the way you skewered Uncle Bill. Your charity will do great things, you know. And the cocktails!\u201d she adds, draining her glass. \u201cWhat a good idea!\u201d</p><p>I gaze at Mum, intrigued. As far as I know, she hasn\u2019t worried about a single thing today. She hasn\u2019t fretted that people might arrive late, or get drunk, or break their cocktail glasses, or anything.</p><p>\u201cMum... you\u2019re different,\u201d I can\u2019t help saying. \u201cYou seem less stressed. What happened?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m suddenly wondering if she\u2019s been to the doctor. Is she taking Valium or Prozac or something? Is she on some drug-induced high?</p><p>There\u2019s silence as Mum adjusts her lilac sleeves.</p><p>\u201cIt was very strange,\u201d she says at last. \u201cAnd I couldn\u2019t tell everybody this, Lara. But a few weeks ago, something strange happened.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was almost as though I could hear...\u201d She hesitates, then whispers, \u201cA voice in my head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA voice?\u201d I stiffen. \u201cWhat kind of voice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a religious woman. You know that.\u201d Mum glances around the church and leans toward me. \u201cBut, truly, this voice followed me around all day! Right in here.\u201d She taps her head. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t leave me alone. I thought I was going mad!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat-what did it say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt said, \u2018Everything\u2019s going to be all right, stop worrying!\u2019 Just that, over and over, for hours. I got quite ratty with it, in the end. I said out loud, \u2018All right, Mrs. Inner Voice, I get the message!\u2019 And then it stopped, like magic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d I manage, a lump in my throat. \u201cThat\u2019s... amazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd ever since then, I find things don\u2019t bother me quite as much.\u201d Mum glances at her watch. \u201cI\u2019d better go, Dad\u2019s on his way round with the car. Do you want a lift?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot just yet. I\u2019ll see you there.\u201d</p><p>Mum nods understandingly, then heads out. As the Charleston morphs into another 1920s tune, I lean back, gazing up at the beautiful molded ceiling, still a bit blown away by Mum\u2019s revelation. I can just see Sadie trailing after her, pestering her, refusing to give up.</p><p>All the things that Sadie was and did and achieved. Even now, I feel like I only ever knew the half of it.</p><p>The medley eventually comes to an end, and a woman in robes appears and starts snuffing out all the candles. I rouse myself, pick up my bag, and get to my feet. The place is already empty. Everyone will be on their way.</p><p>As I head out of the church into the paved forecourt, a ray of sunlight catches me in the eye and I blink. There\u2019s a crowd of people still laughing and talking on the pavement, but no one is anywhere near me, and I find my gaze drifting upward to the sky. As it does so often. Still. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSadie?\u201d I say quietly, out of force of habit. \u201cSadie?\u201d But of course there\u2019s no reply. There never is.</p><p>\u201cWell done!\u201d Ed suddenly descends on me from nowhere and plants a kiss on my lips, making me jump. Where was he, hiding behind a pillar? \u201cSpectacular. The whole thing. It couldn\u2019t have gone better. I was so proud of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Thanks.\u201d I flush with pleasure. \u201cIt was good, wasn\u2019t it? So many people came!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was amazing. And that\u2019s all because of you.\u201d He touches my cheek gently and says more quietly, \u201cAre you ready to go to the gallery? I told your mom and dad to go on.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d I smile. \u201cThanks for waiting. I just needed a moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d As we start walking toward the wrought-iron gate onto the street, he threads his arm through mine and I squeeze it back. Yesterday, out of the blue, as we were walking to the memorial rehearsal, Ed told me casually that he was extending his assignment to London by six months, because he might as well use up his car insurance. Then he gave me a long look and asked me what I thought about him staying around for a while?</p><p>I pretended to think hard, trying to hide my euphoria, then said, yes, he might as well use up his car insurance, why not? And he kind of grinned. And I kind of grinned. And all the time, his hand was tightly knit around mine.</p><p>\u201cSo... who were you talking to just now?\u201d he adds carelessly. \u201cWhen you came out of the church.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I say, a little thrown. \u201cNobody. Um, is the car nearby?\u201d</p> <p>\u201c\u2019Cause it sounded\u201d he persists lightly, \u201cas if you said \u2018Sadie.\u2019\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a beat of silence while I try to arrange my features in exactly the right mystified expression.</p><p>\u201cYou thought I said Sadie?\u201d I throw in a little laugh to show exactly what a bizarre idea this is. \u201cWhy would I say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought,\u201d Ed says, still in the same conversational manner. \u201cI thought to myself, Why would she say that?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s not going to let this go. I can tell.</p><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s the British accent,\u201d I say in sudden inspiration. \u201cMaybe you heard me saying \u2018sidecar.\u2019 I need another \u2018sidecar.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSidecar.\u201d Ed stops walking and fixes me with a long, quizzical gaze. Somehow I force myself to look back with wide, innocent eyes. He can\u2019t read my mind, I remind myself. He can\u2019t read my mind.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something,\u201d he says at last, shaking his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know what it is, but there\u2019s something.\u201d</p><p>I feel a fierce tug in my heart. Ed knows everything else about me, big and small. He has to know this too. After all, he was part of it.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I nod at last. \u201cThere\u2019s something. And I\u2019ll tell you about it. One day.\u201d</p><p>Ed\u2019s mouth twitches into a smile.
