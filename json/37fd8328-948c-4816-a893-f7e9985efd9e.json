Briefly as in, like, two seconds. This was because I\u2019m a teacher and I had a class of twenty kindergartners sitting in front of me and you can\u2019t look away from them. You do, there\u2019s no telling what would happen.</p><p>Case in point? Gerry, the classroom gerbil was now MIA. For the second time this week.</p> <p>Remind me why I became a teacher? Oh. Yeah...because I wanted to shape the mini-minds of the future. And because I love kids.</p><p>Seriously, I do. Most days, anyway. Which is why I\u2019d gone through cosmetology school, and worked my way through college by cutting hair. Last year was the first year I\u2019d taught, so I felt pretty confident that I had my finger on the pulse and all that shit.</p><p>Turns out I was wrong. Namely, because I thought it would be a good idea to have a classroom pet, hence Gerry the Gerbil, aka Houdini. I shouldn\u2019t give him all the credit for being an escape artist; it\u2019s more that the kids giggle and twitch when they hold him and then set him down and...well, you get the idea.</p><p>I clapped my hands and raised my voice as I said, \u201cAlright, kids. Settle down and sit down, please. Maybe then we\u2019ll be able to see where...\u201d</p><p>I sighed as a muffled scream sounded from the room next door. Guess we knew where Gerry went, huh?</p> <p>That pretty much set the tone for the rest of my day. Thank God and every single star in the sky that it was Friday and, not to mention, a long weekend because of Labor Day. Which I had dearly been looking forward to, because I\u2019d get to spend some time with my family.</p><p>I pulled into the garage attached to my house with a sigh, hitting the button to shut the world out behind me. I gathered my purse and my bag overflowing with lesson plans and all that good stuff and headed inside.</p><p>Dropping everything onto the kitchen table, I walked directly into the living room and plopped down on my couch, sprawling out less than gracefully, not caring that my skirt rode up and my panties were showing to anyone who wanted to see them.</p><p>The next thing I knew, I was being shaken awake, a voice like sinful velvet teasing my ears and pulling me from the arms of Morpheus.</p><p>\u201cLeah,\u201d Ian said, softly.</p><p>I blinked up at him, his gorgeous face shadowed in the dim light coming from the kitchen. I sat up quickly, making him jump back to avoid our heads colliding, looking out the window in shock.</p> <p>\u201cHoly shit, what time is it?\u201d I asked, stretching and yawning as I noted the street lights popping on against the darkening sky.</p><p>Ian chuckled and moved up behind me, wrapping his arms around my shoulders and pulling me back against his chest. \u201cSeriously? That\u2019s all I get from you after I haven\u2019t seen you all day? You try to break my nose and stare out the window, no hello kiss, no, \u2018hey honey, I missed you like crazy and can\u2019t wait to suck your face off all night long,\u2019 nothing? Huh.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes and spun in his arms, jumping up so my legs were around his waist, my arms were laced around his neck, and my lips were level to his. He caught me gracefully, completely used to me doing this by now.</p><p>\u201cHmmm...\u201d I murmured against his mouth. \u201cIs this better?\u201d</p><p>I parted my lips and traced the seam of his with the tip of my tongue, silently asking to be let inside. He complied immediately, a low groan breaking from him as I slipped it in to slide against his, our tongues tangling sinuously in a slow, sensual dance.</p><p>His hands squeezed convulsively on the taut cheeks of my ass where they held me, pulling me even closer to his body, letting me feel every inch of hardness hidden behind the denim of his jeans against the soft, giving flesh at the apex of my thighs.</p><p>I finally broke the kiss, leaving us both breathing hard, our foreheads pressed together, eyes locked. We stayed that way for a while, trying to catch our breath and...</p><p>\u201cYou blinked!\u201d he hollered into the stillness suddenly, dropping my feet to the floor and doing a weird victory dance that was just Ian while I stood in front of him, hands on hips, shaking my head.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, yeah, yeah...doesn\u2019t matter. I\u2019m still winning by like, what is it now? 16 to 4?\u201d</p><p>He leaned in and kissed me once more, a brief peck, before he moved back to flop down on the couch. \u201cDo you think we\u2019re seriously bent? I mean, who else in the world plays the staring game in the middle of a heavy make-out session?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cNah. People are probably jealous because we\u2019re cool like that.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, puckering his lips out and giving me that \u2018I\u2019m cool\u2019 look. Trying to, anyway.</p><p>\u201cDuck-face says what?\u201d I asked him, giggling when he scowled at me.</p><p>I moved to the couch and straddled him, sitting on his lap. He leaned his head back and watched me, his hands coming up to cradle my hips. I drank him in, the sight of his hardened, tattooed body stretched out beneath me. His beautiful eyes, heavy lidded with a combination of contentment and lust, stared back at me, the dark green of them, flecked with gold, warming as they watched me. His lips quirked into a smile, their fullness beckoning me closer until I couldn\u2019t help but lean forward and touch them with mine.</p><p>He opened immediately, driving the kiss deeper until we were both moaning and arching into each other, the friction of our bodies pushing me dangerously close to the edge of shattering. My hips jerked against him as his fingers dug into me, pulling me harder and harder against him, urging me toward the finish line.</p><p>He moved his lips away just enough to whisper, \u201cThat\u2019s it, baby...come for me...\u201d</p><p>And that did it. I arched my back and closed my eyes, letting out a long, low moan as pleasure washed over me in waves, leaving me breathless and slumped against him when it was over.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d I cried out in mock outrage as Ian\u2019s hands came down on my ass cheeks, smacking them smartly.</p><p>He chuckled and squeezed them gently, kissing my forehead once more before he asked, \u201cWanna go get some food?\u201d</p><p>I sat up and looked at him strangely. \u201cSeriously? You get me off and suddenly you want nothing more than food?\u201d</p><p>He pecked my lips and moved me off his lap onto the couch beside him. He got up and held his hand out to help me up as he winked and said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. You\u2019ll pay me back later.\u201d</p><p>I laughed and let him help me up, shaking my head and muttering, \u201cSee? We\u2019re seriously bent,\u201d as I followed him to get ready to leave.</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>Staring across the table at Ian an hour later at dinner, I had the fleeting thought that I should really thank my brother again for taking me to the UFC fight with him that night. Actually, I should thank the drunken bastard that started being a douche and set in motion the events that led to Ian carting me out of the fight over his shoulder. Just looking at him, drinking in all that was Ian, I still can\u2019t help but feel amazement that he\u2019s been mine since that night over a year ago.</p><p>Yeah, so I second guessed myself a few times in the beginning, especially when that whore-face started showing up everywhere we went, claiming to be his girlfriend. She almost earned herself a beat-down when Ian and I had gone to his house one night (one of the rare times we slept at his place instead of mine), and Victoria was in his bed. Naked. Did I mention that she was IN. HIS. BED. NAKED!?</p><p>I didn\u2019t get a chance to show of my own personal UFC skills, because Ian had gone nuclear, but in that quiet way of his. The way that you can see the depths of fiery-pissed-off-ness blazing in his eyes, every inch of his body tight, almost vibrating with rage, but his voice is so deceptively calm and dark that it makes you unable to decide whether or not to run, piss your pants, or come all over yourself. Okay, so that was the way I felt about it, and, thank God, that anger has never been turned at me. Ever. But Victoria? She\u2019s good at invoking that beast. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Thankfully, the Victoria pop-ups had dwindled, though she still lurks around the edges.</p><p>But, back to Ian. Jesus, he was so good looking. Dark green, gold flecked eyes, dark brown hair that he kept cut short, but was still unruly; it gave him that I-just-woke-up-but-how-sexy-am-I? look that was just...yummy. Take into account his tall (6\u20193\u201d), lean but muscular frame, the delicious collage of premium ink winding up both of his arms and disappearing beneath the sleeves of his shirt, and his killer smile and you\u2019ve got...well, Ian.</p><p>And Ian was just about perfect. He owned his own construction company and did very well for himself, a fact that, even though his parents love him dearly and support him (mostly), did not sit well overall with his family. That\u2019s because his family is rich. Like uber rich. And they don\u2019t think he needs to work himself so hard, you know, him being only 31 and all. (Insert eye roll here.)</p><p>I hated the fact that he came from money because the first time I met his parents, they acted like I was only with him to ride the gravy train to trophy wife town. They don\u2019t know me well, obviously, but I\u2019m working on changing that. And by working, I mean avoiding them at all costs unless I absolutely have to be around them and their uppity friends, especially the Jones family. Victoria is their daughter. Need I say more?</p> <p>So, a lot has happened in the year since we met. For instance, Brandon and Chloe are planning their wedding, Liam (Allie and Jacks\u2019 gorgeous baby boy) and Everly (Emma and Luke\u2019s beautiful baby girl) both turned one, and I became an auntie again as my sister, Jenna, and her husband, Noah, had their third child, a sweet, even tempered little baby boy named Caleb Andrew, who was now almost three months old.</p><p>My parents love Ian, so there\u2019s that, and Calland, my brother, gets along with him very well, too. Everyone does. And I love that. I love that he already had history with Brandon and Luke (a fact that I found out the night we met; I mean, what a coincidence that they were the ones who did all his tattoos?), and now he\u2019s grown pretty close to T.J., the new tattoo artist that Brandon met in L.A. when he went with Chloe. Did I mention that even Allie\u2019s family loves Ian? Especially Nanny...</p><p>Everyone was happy, but, in my opinion, no one was happier than me.</p><p>\u201cLeah Nicole Jensen!\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, jarred from my reverie by Ian\u2019s voice, smiling automatically at the warm mirth I heard in his tone.</p> <p>\u201cWell, hello, stranger. Are you going to join me for dinner instead of staring at me all night? Not that I mind...I am a rather fetching fellow,\u201d he said jokingly.</p><p>I shrugged and grinned at him as I grabbed my fork and speared a nice, creamy bite of chicken alfredo.</p><p>\u201cWhere the hell were you, love? You seemed a million miles away.\u201d</p><p>I chewed and swallowed, taking a sip of my wine before I answered. \u201cNo where, really. Just kind of thinking about you and the last year. And maybe thanking my brother and the douchebag at the UFC fight mentally for basically dropping you in my lap.\u201d I winked at him and shot him a saucy little smile when his eyes lit up.</p><p>The corners of his mouth turned up in his endearing little grin and he winked back. \u201cI think you were the one dropping in people\u2019s laps, love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, yeah,\u201d I muttered. He wasn\u2019t wrong. I literally had launched myself at the drunken asshat after he\u2019d dumped his whole beer down Chloe\u2019s back, and then when she looked at him, he\u2019d said some pretty nasty stuff. I\u2019m kinda little and I\u2019m quick on my feet, so before Calland could do anything, I did. I tried, anyway. Ian came out of nowhere and caught me in his arms, throwing me over his shoulder and whisking me away to the lobby.</p> <p>We\u2019d all missed the rest of the fight but I can\u2019t say that we much cared.</p><p>I pulled myself back to the present and Ian and I finished dinner before making a quick run through the store so I could pick up a couple things I needed to make double-dipped strawberries for the party. I had to make two batches; one that the kids and \u201cgood\u201d adults could eat, and another for me and the other \u201cbad\u201d adults. Those were the special ones, injected with hundred proof vodka. So freakin\u2019 delicious and addictive.</p><p>It was around ten at night by the time we got back home and settled in. I took a few minutes to wash and prep the strawberries so they\u2019d be ready to inject and dip in the morning and then have time to chill before the party, which would start at two.</p><p>When everything was cleaned up and put away, I walked in and plopped down in Ian\u2019s lap, reveling in the way he accepted my presence with no complaint, his arms coming up to embrace me, pulling me closer into his chest.</p><p>\u201cReady for bed?\u201d he asked me, his voice rumbling through me.</p><p>I scoffed. \u201cAt almost eleven at night on a Friday?\u201d I looked at him like he had two heads and then finished, \u201cHell, yeah, I\u2019m ready for bed!\u201d</p><p>Sad part is that I was and not only because I was ready to jump him, but because I was seriously tired.</p><p>He smacked my thigh gently and commanded, \u201cUp,\u201d getting to his feet and pulling me down the hall once I\u2019d vacated his lap.</p> <p>Without a word, I stripped down and crawled into bed, Ian following me close behind. He hit the bed and stretched out, his arms already reaching for me. He dragged me into his arms, my head pillowed on his chest, one of my thighs draped over his, my arm around his stomach. I sighed as we settled into our familiar night-time pose, and then laughed as Ian whispered into the silent darkness.</p><p>\u201cSo...you remember when I said you\u2019d pay me back later? Well, it\u2019s later.\u201d</p><p>I smacked his chest lightly with my hand, my lips smiling against his warm skin. I faked (sort of) a big, jaw-cracking yawn, and snuggled tighter into him before whispering back, \u201cI\u2019m soooo sleepy...\u201d</p><p>He just chuckled and squeezed me tight.</p><p>So I did what any woman who was so over-the-moon, happy in love with her man would do- I kissed down his chest, moved lower, and paid him back. In full.</p><p>\u201cEMMA MARIE CRIMSHAW!\u201d</p><p>I winced as I carefully kicked the door to Ian\u2019s truck shut, balancing the trays of strawberries as I looked at Ian over the hood.</p><p>His face was lit with amusement, even as he shook his head, muttering, \u201cThat bodes well for the party, already, eh?\u201d</p><p>I sighed, opened my mouth to say something but didn\u2019t get a word out as the shrieking started back up again.</p><p>\u201cEMMA! Seriously! Get your Godforsaken dogs OUT!\u201d Allie was screaming.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not MY FAULT that YOUR DOG taught mine how to swim!\u201d Emma shrieked back in defense, her voice overriding the now audible barking of multiple canines.</p><p>\u201cWell, so what! Who cares about that? Get them OUT OF THE HOUSE!\u201d Allie yelled in reply.</p><p>I winced again as a crash sounded and then heard, \u201cThere! They\u2019re out, are you happy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey just took out my screen door; do you THINK I\u2019m happy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAllie, I\u2019m not sure if you realize this, but that was YOUR DOG who just took out the screen door...NOT MINE!\u201d Emma screeched.</p><p>Mumbling under my breath, I headed up the stairs onto the porch, Ian following behind me, his eyes sparkling with mirth as he reached for the knob to open the front door of Allie and Jacks\u2019 house.</p><p>Before he could open it, though, it swung wide and Jacks was there in front of us, Liam on his hip. \u201cRun. Get out while you still can...it\u2019s not safe in here!\u201d he mock-whispered. Then he rolled his eyes and said, \u201cAnd I swear to God, I\u2019m not replacing that screen one more time. This is the fourth time Grady has run through it this month.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I shook my head at him and kissed his cheek when he bent and presented it to me, then kissed Liam\u2019s rosy little cheek in passing, cooing to him that I\u2019d be back to give him more lovin\u2019 as soon as my hands were empty.</p><p>I braced myself and headed into the war zone, leaving Ian behind, talking with Jacks. As soon as I stepped foot in the kitchen, I saw Luke standing against the wall, holding Everly, both of them wide-eyed but grinning. I smiled and said hello as I sat the strawberries down on the counter.</p><p>\u201cI see I didn\u2019t miss the fireworks,\u201d I quipped, winking at my brother-in-law.</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d he replied, drolly.</p> <p>\u201cHow long has this been going on?\u201d I asked him, moving across the kitchen to peek outside, but not seeing either of the crazies.</p><p>\u201cOh, you know. Since Grady decided to show Doug and DJ that the pool is a great toy and then break down the screen door to let them all run wild and wet through Allie\u2019s house last week. And again today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but they have a gate, so how\u2019re Doug and DJ getting into the pool area?\u201d I asked Luke, moving back across the kitchen to take my niece from him.</p><p>I kissed her cheeks and cuddled her as Luke replied, \u201cGrady has figured out how to knock the latch just right with his nose, so he swings it open and leaves it wide so his friends can come through. Pretty smart if you ask me...but it\u2019s not my house they\u2019re trashing.\u201d</p><p>I winced, pulling air through my teeth as I thought about three large dogs, each roughly a hundred pounds plus, running wet through my nice, well kept house. I\u2019d probably kill them...which is, I\u2019m guessing, what Allie was wanting to do right about then.</p> <p>Jackson and Ian came into the kitchen, Ian now holding Liam, just as Allie and Emma came back inside, each still glowering at the other.</p><p>\u201cAww, fight nice, kids,\u201d I called out to them, grinning mischievously and then laughing as they both transferred their glares to me.</p><p>Emma\u2019s broke first, but that had more to do with the fact that I was holding her daughter, whose face had lit up when her mom had walked into the room.</p><p>Emma crossed the kitchen and reached for her daughter, just as Everly yelled out, \u201cMama!\u201d in her sweet little voice, thus breaking the tension in the room.</p><p>I looked over at Allie but she just shook her head at me and moved to take her son from his father. Jackson left the room briefly, coming back with a stack of towels, and then he and Luke went off to clean up the mess. They\u2019re pretty good husbands, eh?</p><p>As they left the room, Allie walked over by Emma, both of them holding their kids, and we watched in amusement as Emma leaned her head on Allie\u2019s shoulder and whispered, \u201cI still love you and I\u2019m sorry my dogs are jerks.\u201d</p> <p>Allie leaned her head against Emma\u2019s and whispered back, \u201cI still love you, too. And I\u2019m used to it. After all, Grady gets it honestly-he is definitely his father\u2019s son.\u201d</p><p>Emma nodded and whispered back, \u201cDamn dogs.\u201d</p><p>Everyone else started arriving then, and it was a whirlwind to get things set up, but it didn\u2019t take long before everyone was seated wherever they could find a place, eating food, and enjoying the sunshine and company.</p><p>Ian was sitting on the lounger beside me, his plate heaped high with food. I was sharing a lounger with my now 6 year old niece, Hayden, who was telling me, so very kindly as I ate, about her baby brother\u2019s latest diaper blow-out.</p><p>\u201cAuntie Leah, it was everywhere! Like, Mommy had to change the bed and his clothes and her clothes and it was all down his legs and...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright, kiddo, I think Auntie Leah and Uncle Ian have heard enough about that,\u201d Jenna called from the porch. \u201cCome on up here and get something to eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Mom, I already ate-\u201d Hayden started to whine, but Jenna cut her off quickly with a stern look.</p><p>\u201cUh-oh, better go on, Hayden-girl. Your momma\u2019s got that Mother-stink-eye look going,\u201d Calland called out, laughing, winking at Hayden as she grinned his way and nodded.</p> <p>\u201cCalland!\u201d Jenna yelled exasperatedly. \u201cCan you ever just keep your mouth shut and not teach my children bad habits?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope!\u201d he replied sweetly, then gave an exaggerated wince as our mother smacked his shoulder when she walked by.</p><p>I just shook my head and looked over at Ian, who was, as usual, silently laughing through the whole exchange, and then continued eating.</p><p>I\u2019d finished eating when a gravelly old voice broke in loudly and looked up to see Allie\u2019s grandma, Nanny, standing beside Ian.</p><p>\u201cYou gonna let an old woman just stand here, stud? Or are you gonna move that tight little hiney and let me sit with you?\u201d she asked him, hands on her hips, the toes of one foot tapping impatiently.</p><p>Ian wisely moved over to sit beside me, giving up his whole lounger to let Nanny sit down. \u201cThat\u2019s more like it there, hot stuff. But you could\u2019a just sat here with me, you know,\u201d she grumbled, shooting a glare at him.</p><p>\u201cSorry, Nanny,\u201d he said smoothly. \u201cI figured you might want to stretch out and rest yourself a little so you can go for a swim with me in a bit.\u201d He finished that up with a wink that had her chortling with glee.</p><p>\u201cHooo-we! Aren\u2019t you just a hot one? Trying to get me in my bikini and in the water so you can get a look at my goodies,\u201d she cackled, clapping her hands together as she laughed.</p><p>\u201cYour goodies, Nanny? Is that what you\u2019re calling them these days?\u201d Allie called from the table by the door where she was sitting with her parents, my parents, and Poppy, Nanny\u2019s husband and Allie\u2019s Grandpa.</p><p>\u201cAllie, girl, you know I still got my girls. They haven\u2019t given up on me yet, and your Poppy can vouch for me.\u201d</p><p>Allie giggled and nudged her mom before she replied, \u201cYou mean your fried eggs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll show you fried eggs!\u201d Nanny hollered and before anyone could blink, she flipped her shirt up and flashed everyone. And she didn\u2019t have a bra on. Oy. But seriously, Nanny\u2019s girls have gone a little flat over the years, so strangely (or maybe not-so-strangely), Allie\u2019s fried egg reference fit.</p><p>The fall-out from this act was instantaneous and deafening. Allie could only laugh; her mom yelled, \u201cMOTHER!\u201d loudly; Poppy grinned and waggled his eyebrows; my parents both shook their heads and looked away, but I could see them trying to fight back their laughter and smiles; Calland yelled, \u201cMy eyes!\u201d and clapped his hands over them; Emma just laughed outright while Luke kept his eyes averted.</p><p>Thankfully, Brandon and Chloe had gone inside, so they missed the peep show, and the kids were in the house with Jenna to clean up, but, seeing as how Allie and her family have been a part of their lives since birth, I wasn\u2019t so certain they hadn\u2019t seen this before.</p><p>Ian, on the other hand, looked like a deer caught in the headlights.</p><p>Never a dull moment around here...</p><p>Chapter 3</p><p>I giggled and tapped Ian\u2019s ass, since it was literally dangling in front of my face. Okay, so it wasn\u2019t dangling so much as I was, seeing as how I was thrown over Ian\u2019s shoulder and he was carrying me through our house into the bedroom. Quite a familiar pose for me by now.</p><p>He sighed good-naturedly and jiggled me on his shoulder, making me giggle again and, because I could, pinch his ass.</p><p>Then I was (seemingly) flying through the air to land on the bed that had (miraculously) showed up at just the right time to catch me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was late, almost one a.m., and we were just getting home from the party, which was a laugh riot as Nanny made Ian keep his word (even though he really didn\u2019t intend to go swimming) and get in the water with her. And yes, she really wore a bikini. The woman had no shame.</p><p>And, of course, my Mom had brought out pitchers of her kickass sangria as the party wore on, so I was more than a little tipsy, as was much of my family. Yeah, so it was pretty much all of the female members of my family, and Allie\u2019s, but we were all pretty lucky in that we had hot-as-sin men that didn\u2019t mind taking care of us. The only one left unattached was my brother, Calland, and we pretty much disparaged any woman ever being able to calm him down.</p><p>Which brings me back to the moment, me on my back, fully clothed, and giggling uncontrollably, while Ian stood across the room, carelessly stripping his clothes off.</p><p>\u201cI like it when you get naked,\u201d I said, my eyes drinking in every inch of him as it was revealed to me.</p><p>\u201cYou do, huh?\u201d he asked, a small grin quirking up one corner of his luscious mouth.</p><p>I nodded sagely, rolling carelessly to my stomach and then pushing up until I was sitting on my knees in the middle of our decadent, king-size bed.</p><p>Without a word, I reached for the hem of my tee and pulled it up and over my head, leaving me in my bra, short denim shorts, and, strangely, my flip flops that miraculously had stayed on my feet.</p><p>Ian raised a brow at me and his smile grew, his eyes darkening as he took in my breasts spilling over the lacy cups of my bra. I smiled back and hooked my fingers into the waistband of my shorts, flopping (ungracefully) to the side before I dragged them and my panties down my legs and kicked them off, along with my flip flops.</p><p>I cringed and then laughed as they went flying and Ian had to duck to avoid being hit in the face. He cocked his head at me and bared his teeth in a grin I could only describe as predatory before he started stalking to the bed.</p><p>I scrambled up as quickly as my tipsy-self could, warding him off by waving my hands, not even realizing that I was mumbling, \u201cNo, no, no, no, no,\u201d under my breath until he started nodding his head in response.</p><p>\u201cIan,\u201d I whined, sticking my bottom lip out in a pout that I could only hope was sexy and cute. \u201cI wanted to give you tipsy-crazy-drunk sex!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will,\u201d he replied, still advancing. By this time, his knee was on the bed and he was moving close to where I\u2019d plastered myself against the headboard.</p><p>\u201cBut I wanted to be in charge,\u201d I continued, still pouting, but ruining the effect with a giggle.</p><p>\u201cNu-uh,\u201d was all I got in response.</p><p>But then I didn\u2019t care anymore as his hand reached out and curled around my neck, pulling me forward against his chest as his mouth took mine in a hard kiss, his tongue sweeping inside to tangle with mine.</p><p>I groaned as he nipped at my bottom lip and then laved the sting with his tongue, all the while his hands were moving, pulling me closer into his body. I could feel the hard length of him pressing against my belly, a searing heat that made me arch into him, whimpering for more.</p><p>We were chest to chest, both kneeling at the head of the bed and my head was swimming with a heady combination of alcohol and lust, pushing me over the edge of reason.</p><p>Breaking the kiss, I breathed, \u201cFuck me, Ian.\u201d</p><p>He growled low in his throat and shifted. I found myself face down on the bed, while Ian jerked my hips up, his knees spreading my thighs wide, the hot, thick length of him sliding through my wetness before he notched himself into my drenched opening, slamming deep with one thrust.</p><p>I twisted my hands into the comforter and arched my back, tipping my hips up as Ian fucked me hard, a keening cry being wrenched from my lips as the heavy slap of his balls against my clit and the fast, pounding thrusts of his cock brought me to the edge of release almost immediately.</p><p>He gave no mercy and I loved it, but he took it even further when he growled, \u201cUp,\u201d and pulled me up so I was on my hands and knees. He rode me faster and harder then, slamming into me over and over again, sending me screaming over the edge when he fisted his hand in my hair and jerked my head back firmly but gently, ordering, \u201cCome on my cock, baby. Now.\u201d</p><p>I came and I came hard, then rushed headlong into another orgasm as he thrust deep and stayed buried inside me, grinding into me as he found his release.</p><p>We stayed like that for a minute, Ian still throbbing inside me, my sex still pulsing around him, until he, at least, caught his breath enough to move. I felt him leave the bed as I collapsed, face first once more, onto the bed, still fighting to catch my breath.</p> <p>He was back shortly and I sighed as a warm, wet washcloth dipped between my thighs, tenderly cleaning away the evidence of our lovemaking.</p><p>I smiled to myself as I felt his lips brush the back of my thigh before he was gone to the bathroom. It seemed like in no time, he was back and gently moving us beneath the covers, snuggling in with me.</p><p>\u201cLove you, baby,\u201d I murmured, settling against him and yawning as sleep dragged me down.</p><p>But I was awake enough to smile softly against his chest when he whispered, \u201cLove you more,\u201d against my forehead.</p><p>My eyes cracked open, squinting against the sun peeking through the curtains and shining directly on my face. I stretched and yawned, then rolled over to cuddle closer to Ian.</p><p>An invisible Ian, apparently, because the bed beside me was empty. I threw off the comforter and got one leg off the bed before the bedroom door swung open and Ian filled the doorway.</p><p>\u201cMorning, sleepyhead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMornin\u2019,\u201d I mumbled back.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t leave the bed, baby. I made you breakfast,\u201d Ian said, moving into the room.</p><p>I finally noticed the tray (not really a tray...it was a cookie sheet) in his hands and swiftly tucked myself back into the bed, pulling the covers up and leaning against the headboard. Of course, then my bladder started screaming, so I threw the covers off and scrambled off the bed, throwing a hurried, \u201cWait a sec, gotta pee!\u201d over my shoulder as I ran for the bathroom.</p><p>His low chuckle followed me through the room.</p><p>In a flash, I was back on the bed, tray in my lap, with Ian lounging at my side. I bit into a perfectly cooked, crispy piece of bacon and moaned.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so good to me, you know that?\u201d I asked him once I\u2019d chewed and swallowed.</p><p>He didn\u2019t reply, but he did curve his hand over my thigh just below the tray, squeezing lightly.</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling this morning?\u201d he asked after a minute.</p><p>I paused in devouring the plate of cheesy, fluffy scrambled eggs and toast that he\u2019d made to accompany my bacon to answer. \u201cI\u2019m good. You know I don\u2019t get hungover,\u201d I said, scooping another bite into my mouth.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know, but you also don\u2019t usually down six glasses of your Mom\u2019s sangria,\u201d he said with a grin.</p><p>\u201cSix? I thought I finished the pitcher!\u201d I said, laughing.</p><p>He shook his head at me, fondly, as he replied, \u201cYou did. That was your sixth glass.\u201d</p><p>I finished eating and he took the tray from me, leaning over the side of the bed to place it on the floor, before rolling back into me and pulling me beneath him.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I asked softly, reaching up and winding my arms around his neck.</p><p>He dipped his head and nibbled my throat. I sighed and pressed my head back into the pillow to give him better access, then groaned in protest when he lifted his head. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJust telling you good morning the nice way,\u201d he replied, leaning down to brush his lips gently across mine.</p><p>\u201cWell, good morning to you, too. Again,\u201d I said, lifting my head to increase the pressure of my lips against his.</p><p>When he lifted his head again, I smiled up at him. \u201cBreakfast in bed and a morning make-out? Damn, how\u2019d I get so lucky?\u201d</p><p>Chapter 4</p> <p>\u201cIan,\u201d I muttered, but that\u2019s as far as I got.</p><p>It was Monday, the last day of my lovely three day weekend. Sunday had been perfect; how could it not have been with a kickass wake-up from Ian that included breakfast in bed, and then we\u2019d spent the day together, just the two of us. We\u2019d driven down to the huge flea market off 75, spent some time walking around, and then made a pit stop at the new casino they\u2019d built, before I\u2019d made him take me to Mellow Mushroom for dinner. It\u2019s my all time favorite pizza place.</p><p>But, unfortunately, that perfectness had ended about half an hour ago when we\u2019d left the house. This was because we were at Ian\u2019s parents\u2019 house for a \u2018backyard get together\u2019, and that doesn\u2019t make for a great day. Ian had agreed to go because, well, because they were his parents and he loved them and they loved him. Even if they didn\u2019t quite understand each other.</p><p>Honestly, though, that\u2019s not even the reason it wasn\u2019t a great day. What made it a not-so-nice \u2018get-together\u2019 was the fact that his parents had advised that (what a shame!) the Jones family would not be able to make it as they were vacationing on the (no joke) French Riviera...normally good news. However, they\u2019d neglected to mention that Victoria, their daughter and the current bane of my existence, had not gone with them and would be very much in attendance.</p><p>Case in point? The she-bitch was currently standing chest-to-overflowing-chest with Ian, her arms lifted and wrapped securely around his neck as she cooed her hello in his ear. Yes, his face was annoyed, and yes, I could see him trying to pull away from her.</p> <p>But did it irk me that his hands were around her cinched-in waist, perfunctorily returning her embrace even as he tried to push her away? Hell to the yes.</p><p>\u201cAw, how cute are they?\u201d Ian\u2019s mom, Margot, preened, clapping her hands in delight as she came to stand by me in the foyer. \u201cThey\u2019ve been friends for so long, you know,\u201d she said, turning my way.</p><p>I braced myself. The cattiness was coming and we hadn\u2019t even been in the door for ten minutes.</p><p>\u201cEveryone always assumed they\u2019d end up together, which would only cement the long-standing companionship our families have enjoyed for so long.\u201d She sighed and waved a hand. \u201cOh, well. I guess some things just take time...\u201d she paused for effect, \u201cor just aren\u2019t meant to be.\u201d</p><p>Aaaand there it was. The disappointed resignation that thinly veiled the sharp barb of disapproval, tipped in poison to garner the maximum sting.</p><p>\u201cMother,\u201d Ian rebuked tightly, finally free of the octopus, moving close and taking my hand in his.</p> <p>With a vague smile, she turned and gestured for us to follow her. We moved through the large, ostentatiously decked-out house to the back porch where about a dozen and a half people milled around, all very overdressed for a backyard \u201cget together.\u201d</p><p>She paused, looking me up and down before she said, \u201cWell, I suppose you\u2019ll do.\u201d She then proceeded to call out, announcing our arrival to everyone milling about on the back deck area.</p><p>I stiffened immediately, feeling very self-conscious as every eye turned to look at us, and not one of those eyes seemed friendly. I smoothed the skirt of my sundress down and wished that I\u2019d had the foresight to wear something a little dressier. Not that there was anything wrong with what I was wearing; at least, I hadn\u2019t thought so. The dress was baby pink and spaghetti-strapped with a fitted bodice, and the skirt flared out a bit at the hip, stopping at my knees. It fit my petite frame perfectly, accentuating my curves in a flattering way. I\u2019d paired it with white platform wedges (I needed the height since Ian\u2019s 6\u20193\u201d and I\u2019m a measly 5\u20192\u201d), and braided my long, wavy, dark brown hair over my shoulder. My makeup was light, but I\u2019d played up my eyes, making the bright, jade green of them pop.</p><p>But all the women standing on the deck were perfectly coiffed, dressed in head-to-toe designer couture, dripping jewelry, and holding champagne flutes as if they were accessories. They looked like they\u2019d just stepped out of a magazine, and I...didn\u2019t. I hadn\u2019t thought anything when we\u2019d come in because Ian\u2019s mom always dresses to the nines, and of course, Octopus-Girl looked high-end whorish, as always, but no one ever looked askance at her because she belonged. She was one of them.</p><p>Clearly, I wasn\u2019t, and Margot and all her little minions weren\u2019t going to let me forget it.</p><p>I heard Ian sigh beside me and stepped closer to him, knowing that he wasn\u2019t happy with the situation. He wrapped his arm around me and pulled me into his side as we walked out among the crowd, moving toward his dad, who was standing at the railing, overlooking the lush green yard that backed up to the lake. It was beautiful and, given different circumstances every time I\u2019d been there, I could envision myself enjoying the house and the view. Just needed better company.</p><p>\u201cAh, there\u2019s my son, the hard-working, building man!\u201d His dad boomed out, reaching for Ian\u2019s hand and shaking it vigorously while his other pounded him on the shoulder, jostling both of us. \u201cYou ready to retire, live the life of luxury, yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCut the boy some slack, William, he\u2019s still young enough to want to sow his wild oats before he settles into the life of investments like we have. He\u2019ll put his tools down eventually and settle with Victoria, and then you can train him in the game,\u201d one of Ian\u2019s dad\u2019s cronies retorted.</p> <p>\u201cSure, sure,\u201d Ian\u2019s dad answered, jovially.</p><p>\u201cDad,\u201d Ian said, nodding toward his father, ice coating that one word thickly. He then turned to the gentleman standing beside his father, the one who so kindly planned out Ian\u2019s future for him in two brief sentences.</p><p>\u201cMr. Cline.\u201d He pulled me closer to him and replied, \u201cDad, I\u2019m sure you remember Leah Jensen, my girlfriend. Mr. Cline, I don\u2019t know that you\u2019ve had the pleasure. Leah, Charlie Cline, my dad\u2019s co-worker and he\u2019s the investment broker for my parents.\u201d</p><p>I inclined my head in greeting but didn\u2019t get a chance to reply as Ian excused us tersely and moved quickly through the crowd back towards the house. He pulled me through to the kitchen and stopped where his mother was directing the catering staff on where to set up.</p><p>\u201cMother, a word.\u201d</p><p>She turned to him, a small smile quirking the corner of her lips as she asked, \u201cYes, dear? Is something wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re leaving. I don\u2019t know why I do this to Leah, making her come here when you and Dad have done all you can to make her feel uncomfortable. I told you the last time to stop the snarky comments, but both of you continue to be rude and to entertain these ridiculous notions that I\u2019m going to marry Victoria. It\u2019s not happening, and I won\u2019t put up with this anymore, nor will I subject Leah to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIan, what on earth are you talking about? Of course the girl is welcome here, and I do apologize if we\u2019ve made her uncomfortable. How on earth would we have done that?\u201d She played the part to the hilt, laying her hand against her chest and tilting her head towards him in confusion. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, come off it, Mom. I love you and I know you love me, you and Dad both. In your own ways, you\u2019re just trying to make sure I\u2019m happy and taken care of. But I AM happy, much happier than I ever have been, and that\u2019s because of Leah. I love her, she loves me, and that\u2019s the way it\u2019s gonna be. When you decide to stop showing off your money and status, stop pushing Victoria Jones on me, and act like the real human beings I know you and Dad can be, then we\u2019ll be back. Until then?\u201d He paused and then shrugged his shoulders. \u201cI\u2019m done.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything else then, just turned on his heel and tugged me with him towards the foyer.</p><p>\u201cIan Thomas Mitchell, how dare you speak to your mother like that!\u201d she sputtered. \u201cWe\u2019ve stood beside you when you\u2019ve desecrated your body with all of those...those...things all over yourself. We put you through school, let you follow your dream to start your own construction company, even though your father wanted you to go into investments with him. We just want what\u2019s best for you, and we don\u2019t want you to have to work yourself to death in the process. And the whole thing with Victoria, well, you\u2019ve been close friends for your whole lives, and it\u2019s just been assumed that you\u2019d end up together. She\u2019s heartbroken that you refuse to go out with her any longer, especially now that Leah\u2019s in the picture.\u201d</p><p>She turned to me and her smile, though catty, was slightly less hackle-raising than usual. \u201cLeah, I do apologize that we\u2019ve made you uncomfortable. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re a lovely girl and all, it\u2019s simply just a matter of differences. You understand, yes?\u201d</p> <p>I opened my mouth to reply, even though I was at a loss for words since she\u2019d pretty much just told me I wasn\u2019t good enough (in not so many words), but didn\u2019t have to say a thing.</p><p>\u201cAnd once again, Mother, you\u2019ve just reaffirmed my decision. I hope that you and Dad will eventually come to your senses and get your noses out of the air.\u201d He leaned in and kissed her cheek gently and swiftly. \u201cGoodbye, Mother.\u201d</p><p>And that was that. My heart ached for him, because he\u2019d just essentially written his parents off because they were so...so...stuck up. There\u2019s no other word for it. And I was the reason he did it.</p><p>For the first time ever in our relationship, I was second-guessing it. What kind of person would I be to allow myself to come between Ian and his family?</p><p>\u201cStop it.\u201d</p> <p>I blinked and turned my head to look at Ian. I\u2019d been staring out the window, watching the scenery pass by as he drove us home.</p><p>\u201cStop what?\u201d I asked, carefully.</p><p>\u201cStop overthinking what just happened. It\u2019s not your fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Ian-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not built like them, Leah. I\u2019ve known it since I was young. You know it, too, and I hope you realize that I would never stand by and let someone continue to belittle you. And that\u2019s what they\u2019ve done since they met you. It\u2019s been over a year, Leah. I let it go on for too long, and for that, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>I sighed. \u201cI know you\u2019re not like that, Ian. I\u2019ve told you before, I\u2019m not sure how you turned out like you did being raised by them. But they\u2019re your parents.\u201d</p> <p>He shrugged. \u201cAnd you\u2019re the woman I love. You\u2019re the woman I want to spend the rest of my life with. They\u2019ll come around eventually. If not? We\u2019ll cross that bridge when we come to it.\u201d</p><p>We didn\u2019t speak again until we got home, though he did reach over and take my hand, holding it for the rest of the drive. My cell rang as we got inside. I reached into my purse to grab it as Ian headed down the hall toward the bedroom.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d I asked, answering without looking at the display.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Chloe asked me.</p><p>\u201cJust got home from Ian\u2019s parents\u2019 house,\u201d I told her.</p><p>\u201cOh. How\u2019d that go?\u201d she asked, and I could hear the sarcasm in her voice. She already knew the score on that front.</p><p>\u201cMeh. About as well as you\u2019d expect. Only this time? Let\u2019s just say, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll be going back there anytime soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat bad?\u201d she asked, and I could tell she was wincing, even through the phone.</p> <p>\u201cThe usual snark and then shit about Ian finally retiring to work investments with his dad. And don\u2019t even get me started on the looks I got about what I was wearing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you wear?\u201d she asked me.</p><p>I sighed before I replied, \u201cMy pink sundress with my white wedges.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you fucking kidding me?\u201d Chloe shrieked indignantly.</p><p>I nodded, even though she couldn\u2019t see me. \u201cI wish I was. But you\u2019d think I\u2019d shown up in a garbage bag the way they all looked at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that dress is adorable and you look hot in it!\u201d She growled and I couldn\u2019t help but laugh at her.</p><p>\u201cThank you, sunshine,\u201d I said, deliberately using Brandon\u2019s pet name for her.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Brandon\u2019s voice came through the phone in the distance. \u201cThat\u2019s my name for her!\u201d</p><p>\u201cChloe! Do you have me on speaker phone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh...yeah. Sorry.\u201d She giggled. \u201cI actually had a reason for calling you, and that\u2019s why it was on speaker. I just got sidetracked when you started talking about Ian\u2019s parents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait a sec, though. Was Skanktoria there?\u201d Chloe asked.</p><p>I laughed as I heard Brandon in the background again. \u201cChloe! That\u2019s mean,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s true, Brandon, and you know it. She is a skank, the way she throws herself at Ian whenever she\u2019s around. Granted, she\u2019s not been around lately, but still. You saw her the last time, practically naked in his lap down at Griff\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t lying. A couple of months ago, we\u2019d all be down at Griff\u2019s for a night out. It was packed, which wasn\u2019t unusual for the place, especially because they had a live band that night, but we\u2019d been dancing when Ian was grabbed from behind. When he\u2019d gotten untangled, he\u2019d turned to see it was a very scantily clad Victoria, and she\u2019d been sloshed out of her mind. It wasn\u2019t a fun night.</p><p>I cut in, stopping Chloe from arguing Brandon to death. \u201cYeah, she was there, and she didn\u2019t waste any time getting her octopus arms around Ian. And of course, then his mom had to go on and on about how they were meant to be together or whatever, blah blah blah.\u201d I rolled my eyes, even though she couldn\u2019t see me.</p><p>\u201cSo, same ol\u2019 same ol\u2019, that\u2019s what you\u2019re saying, right?\u201d Chloe asked me, laughing.</p><p>\u201cYou got it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. Anyway, that\u2019s not what I was calling for. I have an idea that I think you\u2019re gonna want in on. It\u2019s something that we haven\u2019t done in a long time, and it\u2019s overdue in my opinion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked, completely intrigued.</p><p>All she said in reply was, \u201cDown &amp; Dirty,\u201d before I\u2019d chimed in.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in!\u201d</p><p>Chapter 5</p><p>I waved as the last child stepped onto his bus, and then turned to go back inside to straighten up my classroom and gather things up before I headed home. On the way, I stopped by Gerry\u2019s cage and topped up his food and water, then sat at my desk to go over the next day\u2019s lesson and to check my supply list for the activities I had planned. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Once I had that done, I looked over the rhyme and match worksheets we\u2019d done in class today before I locked up my desk and grabbed my keys. I stood, stretching before I reached for my purse, then twirled around in surprise when I heard a noise behind me.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d I said, smiling at Chloe who had entered the room.</p><p>\u201cHey, yourself!\u201d she called, moving closer to give me a hug, which I gladly returned.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d I asked her, moving back to my desk to reach for my purse once more.</p> <p>\u201cComing to steal you so we can meet Emma and Allie for dinner to discuss the fun party we\u2019re gonna have,\u201d she said, doing a crazy little jig of excitement.</p><p>\u201cSweet!\u201d I said. \u201cI just have to call Ian and let him know.\u201d I grabbed my cell and dialed Ian, hoping he\u2019d answer so I wouldn\u2019t have to leave him a message.</p><p>Turns out, I was lucky today. He answered on the second ring.</p><p>\u201cHey baby,\u201d he said.</p><p>I could hear the smile in his voice and my lips curled up automatically. \u201cHey, yourself, handsome. Just wanted to call and let you know that Chloe just showed up here and we\u2019re meeting Allie and Emma for dinner. Want me to pick something up for you to bring home?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure, baby. I\u2019ll see you later, then. Love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove you, too,\u201d I told him, still smiling as I hung up the phone.</p><p>Chloe rolled her eyes at me.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you roll your eyes, goofy. You forget I know you very well, and I know how you and Brandon are,\u201d I said, narrowing my eyes at her playfully.</p><p>\u201cTruth,\u201d she said, nodding her head and grinning unrepentantly.</p><p>I glanced at the clock. \u201cIt\u2019ll be an early dinner, though, is that okay? It\u2019s only...oh. I guess I took longer than I thought to go through papers and lesson plans,\u201d I said, noting that it was going on five already. Classes usually let out just after three, so I\u2019d been working on stuff for almost two hours? Huh.</p> <p>\u201cYep,\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s go. They said we could pick, just have to call and let them know where we\u2019re going.\u201d</p><p>I looked at her and, without missing a beat, we both said, \u201cManny\u2019s!\u201d</p><p>Half an hour later, the four of us were laughing around a table, stuffing our faces with delicious salad, pasta, and garlic bread, and sipping glasses of sangria. Manny had already come out and berated Allie and Emma for coming in without bringing the little ones to see him. When he\u2019d left the table, Emma told us that she and Luke had come in to eat with Everly last month and when they\u2019d been seated, Manny had walked right out of the kitchen, up to their table, barely said hello to them, and had taken off with Everly. Allie then told us that he\u2019d done the same to them two weeks ago when she and Jackson had come in.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t surprised; we\u2019d been coming to Manny\u2019s since we were all kids and Manny and his wife, Gia, absolutely adored kids. Seriously, they had 7 of their own.</p><p>I took a sip of my sangria as Chloe asked, \u201cSo when are we wanting to do this? Allie, are you stocked up on everything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI actually did a party last week and refreshed my supplies then, so I should be good. But you know the drill, anything I don\u2019t have on hand, you\u2019ll still have it in a week or so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Chloe said with a twinkle in her eye. \u201cBut there\u2019s some stuff I was hoping you\u2019d have and I wouldn\u2019t have to wait!\u201d</p><p>Allie rubbed her hands together with glee and waggled her eyebrows crazily. \u201cYay! I love it when I get to have a party with friends that makes me money!\u201d</p> <p>Emma quirked an eyebrow at her and said, drolly, \u201cWhat money? You always use up your revenue replenishing your stock or buying your own goodies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDuh,\u201d Allie replied. She winked at Emma, who just shook her head.</p><p>I spoke up. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we give it a couple weeks or so to make sure we get the invites out. Where do we want to have it?\u201d</p><p>We hammered out the details and then just sat and talked with each other, even long after the food was gone. Emma\u2019s phone rang, breaking into the conversation, and I looked at my watch to see that it was already seven and I hadn\u2019t even ordered anything for Ian, yet.</p><p>As Emma answered her phone, I waved our waiter over and ordered some chicken marsala with a side of fettuccini alfredo for him, which then reminded Allie and Chloe that they needed to do the same. I kicked Emma under the table and motioned, asking silently if we needed to get something for Luke.</p><p>She spoke into the phone. \u201cDo you want me to get you something from here?\u201d</p><p>She paused. \u201cUh-huh. Nope. Yep. Okay, I know. Honey, I just asked you a question, is it that hard to answer?\u201d More pausing. \u201cFine. Love you...yeah, yeah, yeah. Love you, bye.\u201d</p><p>She hung up and quickly added two more meals to the take-out orders we\u2019d already placed.</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d Allie said, looking at Emma weirdly. \u201cIs Luke eating for two or are you hungry again?\u201d</p><p>Emma laughed. \u201cNo, it\u2019s for T.J.\u201d</p><p>Chloe\u2019s face got soft and then worried at T.J.\u2019s name. \u201cHave you talked to him lately?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho? T.J.?\u201d Emma asked. Chloe nodded and she continued, \u201cYeah, he comes over quite a bit when he\u2019s not over at your house. Why, what\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>Chloe shook her head, almost sadly, and shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m just worried about him. He\u2019s got so much going on in his head all the time, and I swear, anytime a phone rings anywhere near him, he\u2019s jumpy as hell. But, he just blows it off, says everything is fine.\u201d</p><p>Allie broke in again. \u201cSo what was all that other shit, then?\u201d she asked Emma.</p><p>\u201cOh, you know. The usual. Am I coming home soon? Did I miss him? Which, of course, I lied and said nope, but we all know I always miss him,\u201d she broke off, giggling. \u201cAre we having fun? We need dog food, so I have to stop at the store.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cNo biggie.\u201d</p><p>I knew my sister too well, and so did Allie because she called her out right away. \u201cNope. That\u2019s not all. What was the yeah, yeah, yeah for after you said I love you? Hmmm?\u201d</p><p>Emma blushed, which was the exact reaction we all knew we\u2019d get. \u201cNothing!\u201d she exclaimed.</p><p>\u201cEmma,\u201d I said, my voice low with warning.</p><p>\u201cJesus, he just reminded me I owed him, okay?\u201d she finally said, breaking after I stared her down comically.</p><p>Chloe held her hands up. \u201cNope! We\u2019re good! No more details!\u201d she cried, laughing.</p><p>Emma grinned devilishly, opened up her mouth, and proceeded to tell us, in detail, why she owed him, no matter that all of us were shrieking for her to stop, laughing, and practically falling out of our seats, making fools of ourselves, much to the amusement of the people around us. Thankfully, we were in a more secluded section of the restaurant and there weren\u2019t many people there.</p><p>Unfortunately, the poor waiter just happened to bring out our to-go orders during Emma\u2019s....erm...description, and was standing, red-faced, beside her chair, holding the bags out to us and looking at the floor.</p><p>As soon as Emma saw him, her face turned an even brighter red (which is saying something) and she dropped her head in her hands in mortification.</p><p>Just another night with the girls...never a dull moment. Ever. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter 6</p><p>After wrapping up my evening with the girls, I grabbed the food I\u2019d ordered for Ian and made the drive home, rocking out with the windows down and the music up loud. And when Uptown Funk came on, I turned it up even louder and sang along at the top of my lungs because, let\u2019s face it. You can\u2019t help but dance and sing to that song. Mark Ronson and Bruno Mars know what they\u2019re doing, for sure.</p><p>I pulled into the driveway and parked beside Ian\u2019s truck, not bothering to pull into the garage. I gathered all my stuff and Ian\u2019s food up and walked inside, hollering, \u201cHoney, I\u2019m home!\u201d</p><p>Receiving no response, I laid his food on the counter and dropped everything else beside it, moving through the house looking for him. He was nowhere to be found inside the house, so I checked out on the back porch. I saw him there, sitting in the chair, staring off into the distance.</p> <p>\u201cHey,\u201d I said softly as I walked out to him, stopping at his side.</p><p>He was leaned back, the neck of a bottle of beer dangling from his fingers.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he said back, not moving, not looking at me.</p><p>I sat in the chair beside him, concern washing over me. \u201cIs everything okay?\u201d</p><p>He nodded once, and then quickly shook his head. \u201cJust a rough day today, I guess. I had to fire a man for being so careless that one of my other workers ended up in the hospital today.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d I breathed, reaching out and taking his free hand in mine. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarl happened. Fucker went to Griff\u2019s for lunch, which is no big deal, but he decided to have a few beers and a shot while he was at it. That is a real big deal. Came back, got into the bobcat, and then didn\u2019t pay attention when he swung it around the corner. Ran it right into the side of an S-10 truck that was just pulling in. The guy driving, when the bucket hit the truck, thank God, was wearing his seatbelt, but he hit his head against the window. Knocked him out.\u201d</p><p>I sank back in my seat, my hand automatically coming up to cover my mouth. \u201cIs he okay?\u201d</p><p>Ian nodded. \u201cYeah, he\u2019ll be fine. He\u2019s off for a couple weeks with a concussion, unless there\u2019re complications with him. Carl got a little whiplash from hitting the truck, but he was fired on the spot. I mean, drinking on the fucking job! Goddamn, that pisses me off! He could have killed someone!\u201d</p><p>Ian was yelling, his voice getting hoarse with emotion. I let him vent, still holding his hand in mine, my thumb drawing soothing circles against the back of his. Finally, he took a deep breath and then finished off the rest of his beer.</p><p>\u201cYou know, it could have been a lot worse. But what gets me, what pisses me off the most, is that Carl is a damn good worker. But he\u2019s a fucking alcoholic. How did I not know that? How did I not catch that when he\u2019s been with me for over a year now?\u201d</p> <p>His face was tortured, his breathing ragged.</p><p>I moved from my chair and draped myself over his lap, wrapping my arms around him and holding him tightly to me. He dropped his bottle and his arms came up and squeezed me.</p><p>\u201cBaby, it\u2019s not your fault. He\u2019s your employee, you\u2019re not his father. Have you ever caught him drinking on the job before?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNo, but I\u2019m at different sites all the time, so I\u2019m not always there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the foreman for that job? Has he noticed anything, since he\u2019s there all the time?\u201d I asked him. He shook his head again and I continued, \u201cThen how would you have known he was an alcoholic? Sometimes people with addictions are pretty adept at hiding it, until they get to that point that they just can\u2019t anymore. It sucks that that\u2019s where he\u2019s at, apparently, and it really sucks that it caused someone else to get hurt.\u201d</p><p>Ian nodded against me and then heaved a sigh, his warm breath washing over my skin. \u201cI know. I just can\u2019t help but feel like it\u2019s my fault, like I should have been paying more attention.\u201d</p><p>I kissed his forehead and his cheek, remaining silent for the moment. After a bit, he released me and I stood, reaching for his hand again. \u201cCome on and eat, and then we\u2019ll veg out for a while, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he replied. He stood and pulled me into his chest, one of his hands coming up to cradle my jaw and tip my head back so he could see my eyes. \u201cI love you,\u201d he said, softly.</p> <p>I could feel just about every inch of my body softening against him, and my lips curled into a smile as I pushed up on my toes, pressing my lips against his and whispering, \u201cI love you, too,\u201d before I kissed him.</p><p>Afterwards, Ian and I cuddled up on the couch while he ate and watched reruns of The Big Bang Theory, pausing the TV only once when Ian\u2019s phone rang. I listened with half an ear as he spoke to someone about the events of the day, but as soon as he was done, he un-paused the TV and went back to watching without a word. I didn\u2019t push him to talk, and he didn\u2019t offer anything more.</p><p>But we didn\u2019t need to talk. It was enough just to be together, to draw strength from each other when needed without the words needing to be said. It worked for us...and it was perfect.</p><p>We were lying in bed a couple hours later, cuddled up as usual, when Ian broke the silence of the darkened room.</p><p>\u201cSo, what was this whole get together about tonight, anyway?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I laughed softly, asking in return, \u201cWhy did it have to be about something? We always like to get together for girl\u2019s nights anyway, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but I know when you guys are up to something. So what do I have to look forward to, now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing for you to worry about, I promise!\u201d I said, humor lacing the words.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. Famous last words...\u201d Ian mumbled good-naturedly.</p><p>I leaned back and propped my head on my hand, my elbow digging into the mattress. \u201cNope, seriously. It\u2019s a good thing,\u201d I said, drawing the words out with a breathy tone.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m listening,\u201d he replied, and I could tell he was completely intrigued now.</p><p>I laughed and rolled into him again, my lips finding his in the darkness and giving him a quick kiss. \u201cWe\u2019re having a Down &amp; Dirty party in a couple weeks. You know, just another excuse to get together and drink and have a good time. And maybe buy some new sex toys while we\u2019re at it...\u201d I let my words trail off suggestively as I trailed a finger down his chest.</p><p>He stopped my hand with his, pressing it fully against his chest as he said, quickly, \u201cI\u2019m down with that. Sure...when\u2019s the party?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head and chuckled as I kissed him once more, then settled back down in the bed, my head on his shoulder, my arm lying across his stomach, my leg thrown over his thigh.</p><p>I yawned as I answered, \u201cI already told you in a couple of weeks. Geez, pay attention.\u201d</p><p>He just chuckled and gave me a squeeze, kissing my forehead. \u201cNight, baby. Love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d I murmured, snuggling in closer. \u201cG\u2019night. Love you, too.\u201d</p><p>We were quiet again for just a moment before I cleared my throat and asked him, softly, \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>I heard him take a deep breath, then he kissed my forehead once more, pulling me even closer to his body and replied, \u201cWith you in my arms, in my life, I\u2019m more than okay.\u201d</p><p>I smiled against his chest and drifted off to sleep. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The next few days were pretty uneventful. Ian was busy dealing with the insurance people and all that shit that goes along with what happened. He\u2019d even spoken to Emma\u2019s old boss, Floyd Grim, to get his professional opinion on everything, just to cover his bases.</p><p>Ian had gone to his office this afternoon to meet with him, and Floyd had agreed to help him out with the legal side of things if he needed it, which was nice of him. He\u2019d then asked Ian to see if Emma would like to come back to work for him since his current secretary didn\u2019t hardly know her ass from a hole in the ground. His words apparently, not Ian\u2019s.</p><p>Ian called Emma when he got home and relayed the message, which prompted Emma to call Floyd and thank him for the offer, but, between Skin Deep and Everly, she had her hands full, so she\u2019d declined regretfully. He had asked her to call Mrs. Allen and check on her every once and a while, though, seeing as how the old woman still called every week and now instead of only bitching about Doc (the vet) and Fluffers (her mangy, overweight, freak of a cat), she spent most of the time bemoaning the fact that her Emma wasn\u2019t there to talk to her.</p><p>I knew this because Emma had just called me and was filling me in.</p> <p>\u201cI feel bad for him,\u201d Emma was saying about Floyd. \u201cHe\u2019s a really good attorney and a lot of people applied for my job, but I guess he was doing a friend a favor and letting this girl work for him but she keeps losing files because she can\u2019t remember how she filed them in the cabinets. Yikes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait a sec, what happened to the woman that had stepped in to cover when you left?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Emma sighed. \u201cShe was just filling in, but apparently she retired, so...this is what he\u2019s left with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmm,\u201d I said, feeling bad for Floyd. \u201cSo, did you call Mrs. Allen?\u201d I asked her, tongue-in-cheek.</p><p>Emma groaned. \u201cOh, God. Yes, I did. I swear I\u2019m a glutton for punishment because she kept me on the phone for a good forty-five minutes talking about Fluffers and the latest hairball he\u2019d hacked up. Don\u2019t even get me started on the whole Doc thing, either. Jesus, you\u2019d think the man would just let the cat be a matted mess rather than subjecting himself to the ass-chewing he gets every time.\u201d</p> <p>I laughed until tears were pouring down my face as Emma continued to recount her conversation. When she was finally done, we chatted a little bit more, with her asking about Ian and if he\u2019d gotten everything worked out about the accident at work. Then she asked about my class and if I had any new funny stories.</p><p>Ironically (or not so ironically), I did. And who did it involve? Gerry the Gerbil, of course. \u201cYeah, I had a kid try to smuggle Gerry out of the classroom yesterday. How did he do that, you ask? Well, let me tell you,\u201d I said, heavy on the sarcasm and disbelief. Seriously, if it wasn\u2019t something I\u2019d lived through myself, I\u2019d probably think I was a liar.</p><p>Ian was sitting in the recliner and I was kicked back on the couch, but he must have been listening with half-an ear, because he started chuckling.</p><p>Emma was already laughing, too, just imagining what was coming. \u201cHold on, wait, wait...let me put this on speaker. I know Luke, Brandon, and T.J. are gonna wanna hear this!\u201d</p><p>I paused, asking, \u201cAre you still at the shop?\u201d I looked at the clock, seeing that it was after seven and she was usually home with Everly by then.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Mom and Dad took the baby for the night, and the guys had a couple clients booked so I hung around. Watching all the tatted up sexiness strut around is hard work, you know,\u201d she drawled, and I could hear the guys laughing and hooting in the background.</p> <p>\u201cGeez, what a rough Friday night you\u2019re having,\u201d I retorted, rolling my eyes at Ian. Emma just laughed again. \u201cAnyway, back to Gerry-\u201d</p><p>I was cut off by T.J. asking, \u201cWho the fuck is Gerry?\u201d but before I could reply, I heard Luke say, \u201cNot who, what. Gerry\u2019s a gerbil, dude.\u201d</p><p>I opened my mouth to continue again, and once more was cut off. Ian looked at me weird, so I covered the phone with my hand and whispered to him, \u201cShe put it on speaker, so now the guys are all interrupting.\u201d He nodded in an, \u2018Ahhh, I get it,\u2019 way and went back to watching TV, his lips still twitching in anticipation of what I was about to say.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell do you have a gerbil for, Leah?\u201d T.J. asked.</p><p>I didn\u2019t even bother answering, and for good reason. I heard Brandon pipe up with, \u201cFor illicit sexual acts, dumbass. What do you think?\u201d He said it sarcastically, thank God, which is the only reason I still kept my mouth shut. \u201cIt\u2019s the class pet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah,\u201d T.J. answered. \u201cI forgot she was a teacher.\u201d</p><p>I winced when Emma clapped her hands loudly, obviously not bothering to move them away from where she must have laid the phone down when she put it on speaker phone. \u201cAlright! Let the poor girl finish or I\u2019m taking it off speaker and you don\u2019t get to hear!\u201d she yelled.</p><p>Yup. That\u2019s my sister.</p> <p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I started again. \u201cSo about half an hour before the end of class, one of the boys in the class asked if he could get Gerry out and hold him for a bit. I said sure, helped him get him out, and set him up-oh, did I tell you I got a tiny little plastic kiddy pool and put it in the corner so the kids could kneel at the side and put Gerry in it so he\u2019d quit getting loose?\u201d I asked, cutting myself off.</p><p>\u201cNo, you didn\u2019t. That\u2019s a good idea! Now you won\u2019t have to worry about the other teachers staging a protest anymore,\u201d Emma said.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, I let the boy put Gerry in the pool and he was sitting there, petting him and watching him run around. I turned around to answer another student who asked a question and when I turned around, Gerry was not in the pool anymore. I asked him where Gerry was and he said that he jumped out of the pool.\u201d</p><p>Emma and the guys must have been completely invested in the story now, because I wasn\u2019t hearing a peep from their end.</p><p>\u201cI looked around, but I was a little suspicious, especially because I noticed that he was starting to fidget a lot more than usual-\u201d</p><p>Brandon interrupted this time. \u201cThe kid, not Gerry, right?\u201d</p><p>I sighed. \u201cYes, the kid, I didn\u2019t know where Gerry was, remember? Pay attention!\u201d I said, jokingly. \u201cMoving on. I asked the kid if he was telling the truth, and his face got really red. All of a sudden, he let out this God-awful shriek and started dancing around, holding his crotch!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, hell no!\u201d one of the guys hollered. \u201cHe put it down his pants? That\u2019s just messed up!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, right?\u201d I replied, still in disbelief that it had actually happened. \u201cI got him to hold still and asked him to please carefully take Gerry out of his pants. He did, and handed me a very clearly traumatized, but no worse for the wear, gerbil. But the poor kid was crying, saying that Gerry bit him so I had to get someone to cover my room for a minute and walk him up to the office to call his parents. They had to come down and check him with the nurse, you know, since it was in a delicate area.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God!\u201d I heard a mix of groaning and laughter coming from the other end of the line and figured that the guys were probably cupping themselves protectively, same as Ian did last night when I told him what happened.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t really get bit on his little...you know. It was more like Gerry just nipped him on his thigh, didn\u2019t break the skin, no marks, nothing. Do you know how mortifying it is to have to explain to a parent that their son put a gerbil in his pants?\u201d I cried, feeling my face flame red with embarrassment once more, just thinking about it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat did his parents say?\u201d Emma asked.</p><p>\u201cThey just asked him why he put Gerry in his pants and he told them he just wanted to take him home so he could have a gerbil. No other reason.\u201d</p><p>Luke called out, \u201cWell, Leah wins most interesting day, hands down.\u201d</p><p>Sadly, no one disagreed.</p> <p>With that conversation over, Emma and I talked for just a couple more minutes and hung up, but only after I promised that we would be at Mom and Dad\u2019s for Sunday breakfast. That was something we\u2019d always done, but since the group had grown so much and everyone had their own things going all the time, we didn\u2019t do it as often, but Mom had put her foot down and said she was reinstating Sunday breakfast, or else. We didn\u2019t ask or else what. We knew the answer.</p><p>Because she said so.</p><p>Chapter 7</p><p>I stood in the doorway to Ian\u2019s office, completely dumbstruck by what I saw.</p><p>It was Friday once more, and the week since the \u201cincident\u201d as we were calling it had passed without event. I was grateful for that...until now. I\u2019d come down to Ian\u2019s office, which I did from time to time, just to see him, especially when I knew he\u2019d be there and not out on a job.</p> <p>But it wasn\u2019t Ian in his office chair.</p><p>Nope. Far from it.</p><p>And as I stood there, frozen to the spot, unable to say a word, though rage was working its way through my body, coursing through my veins until they were almost boiling, I felt warm hands circle round my waist, pulling me back against a hard chest.</p><p>The velvet, deep voice that I so loved spoke in my ear, saying, \u201cHey, baby...\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s when his eyes followed my gaze and his whole body stiffened. \u201cFucking hell!\u201d he roared, gently pushing me to the side out of his way. He strode into his office, reaching for the zippered hoodie he had hanging on a hook just inside the door and threw it at Victoria, who was lounging in his chair, feet propped up on his desk.</p><p>Naked. With the exception of a hard hat and high heels.</p> <p>\u201cGet the fuck outta my chair and cover yourself!\u201d Ian growled, clenching his fists and glaring at the woman.</p><p>She just giggled and slowly lifted herself out of his chair, taking her time wrapping herself in his shirt. \u201cHey, lover!\u201d she said, cheerfully. \u201cI came by to surprise my boyfriend at work but,\u201d she paused and turned to look at me.</p><p>I\u2019ve never been scared of Victoria. Nothing about her had ever given me pause that maybe, just maybe, she was a little more dangerously unhinged than we thought...until that moment.</p><p>The moment her eyes hit me, chills raced down my spine and goosebumps crept along my skin. There was a deeper calculation in her eyes that I\u2019d never seen before, and it didn\u2019t get any better when she spoke. It was like a totally different woman from the one I\u2019d been dealing with for the past year.</p><p>\u201cBut, someone obviously can\u2019t take the hint that we\u2019re together,\u201d she continued. She turned to Ian then and said, \u201cYou know, I\u2019ve let you have your fun, but don\u2019t you think it\u2019s time you were done sowing your wild oats? I\u2019m ovulating, so it\u2019s the perfect time to start our family, and your mom has been holding your grandmother\u2019s ring for you to give me. I even had it sized already, so it\u2019ll fit perfectly when you finally propose.\u201d</p><p>She preened and minced over to Ian, reaching up and running her hand down his t-shirt covered chest. She pouted when he flinched away, knocking her hand down.</p><p>The shock wore off enough that I finally found my tongue. \u201cDon\u2019t touch him!\u201d I said, sharply. She turned to look at me again, a disturbing gleam in her eyes. \u201cGet your shit and get the fuck out of here. You aren\u2019t wanted here by anyone, Victoria, especially Ian. Get it through your fucked-up head,\u201d I said, my voice low with warning.</p><p>She only tossed her hair and giggled again, her eyes never leaving mine as she stepped forward, deliberately moving toward Ian, who backed away from her advance, hands still clenched at his sides. She kept going, watching me as she backed him into the wall and pressed herself against him, rubbing her chest against his. She dropped my gaze long enough to lean forward, aiming her lips toward Ian\u2019s face and, when he turned his face away, licked along his jawline until she pressed her lips against his cheek, leaving a bright red imprint of her lips behind before he brought his hands up and cupped her shoulders, gently but firmly pushing her away from him.</p> <p>In that moment, I wished, just for a second, that Ian was the type of man to hit a woman. Because there was no woman on the face of the planet who deserved it more right then.</p><p>Unable to control myself, I stepped forward, my hands fisted at my sides so I wouldn\u2019t jerk her away by her hair and pound her in her face until she was unrecognizable. \u201cBitch,\u201d I said, tightly, but I didn\u2019t get any further.</p><p>Ian moved away from her, grasping my arm and pulling me into him, his arms wrapping around me for two obvious reasons. One, to keep me from attacking, and two, to show Victoria, again, that he was choosing me.</p><p>His words, when he spoke, were sharp and brutal. He pulled no punches this time, all thinly veiled attempts at niceness completely out the window.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve told you time and time again that there is nothing between us. There never will be. Any schemes that you have with my parents, or even on your own, that you\u2019ve cooked up in that Godforsaken bubble of a brain, just forget them. It\u2019s NEVER going to fucking happen. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>I could feel him trembling against me, knew he was beyond pissed.</p><p>Victoria cocked a hip and pouted, sticking her lip out comically, like a five year old would. Her eyes filled with tears and she stood there staring for just a second before she stomped her foot and shrieked in her throat, literally throwing a temper tantrum.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help it. Disbelieving laughter bubbled from my lips. I mean, seriously, was this 30 year old woman really acting like a toddler?</p><p>As soon as she heard me laughing, the pout left her face and I bit my lips, all traces of humor gone in an instant because that cold calculation was back in her eyes. She drew Ian\u2019s hoodie close around her and walked to the door, swaying her hips exaggeratedly. She stopped in the doorway and looked over her shoulder at us.</p><p>\u201cI tire of these games, Ian. I\u2019ve overlooked all of your little affairs over the years, knowing that you just had to get it out of your system before we got married and started our family, just like our parents have always planned. But this one? She\u2019s overstayed her welcome. I\u2019ll give you six months to deal with this...this...\u201d she waved her hand at me, her face twisted in disgust before she continued, \u201cgirl. But then I expect you to come home to me. And trust me, I\u2019ll be checking in in the meantime to make sure that you\u2019re scraping her off.\u201d</p><p>After delivering her ridiculous ultimatum, she flung her hair over her shoulder and strode out.</p><p>I glanced up at Ian and saw him staring out the doorway, a muscle in his cheek twitching. I slid my arms around his waist and buried my face against his chest, shaking my head, utterly baffled by what had just happened.</p><p>I felt Ian pull me closer, then his head came down and he rested his cheek against the top of mine. He held me like that for a moment, then lifted my face to his with a gentle finger under my chin.</p><p>\u201cYou know that she\u2019s completely delusional right? There\u2019s no way in hell that I knew she was going to be waiting here in my office...\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI know. But...God, Ian, did you see the way she looked at me? Like, I felt chills. Does she have a history of torturing household pets, or any other characteristics of a serial killer? Because, seriously, she just gave me that vibe.\u201d</p><p>A ghost of a smile crossed Ian\u2019s face and faded quickly. \u201cNo, she\u2019s not dangerous. But she\u2019s obviously got a screw looser than I thought. Don\u2019t worry, baby. I\u2019m not playing around anymore. I\u2019m calling my parents and letting my mom know exactly what I think of her conniving little ploy, and then I\u2019ll be calling Victoria\u2019s parents and telling them just what she\u2019s been up to.\u201d</p><p>I kept silent. There was nothing to say to that because I think we both knew that it wouldn\u2019t help. We\u2019d thought she\u2019d given up and she came back with a vengeance.</p><p>And now, I was a little afraid to see what she\u2019d come up with next.</p> <p>An hour later, it was still the foremost thought on my mind as I threw together a salad while Ian grilled some steaks and corn on the cob for dinner. We really hadn\u2019t spoken any more about it; I don\u2019t think either of us wanted to bring it up.</p><p>Ian came in the back door and sat the platters of perfectly cooked meat and corn down on the counter, then placed a sweet kiss on my shoulder as he moved behind me to the cabinet to get plates out for us to eat on.</p><p>We sat at the table to eat rather than eating in the living room in front of the TV, which is what we usually did. But then again, it\u2019s easier to eat corn on the cob and steak when you\u2019re not balancing a plate in your lap. Trust me. Or, I guess it could be just that my whole family is just accident prone...</p><p>Ian was the first to break the silence. \u201cSo, the big party is tomorrow, huh?\u201d He waggled his eyebrows at me, making me roll my eyes and grin at him.</p><p>\u201cYes, the party is tomorrow. Why?\u201d I asked him suspiciously.</p> <p>\u201cNothing. Just wondering.\u201d He shot me a cocky smile and I narrowed my eyes at him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re up to something,\u201d I stated, pointing my finger in his direction. \u201cWhat did you do? Or what are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>He pretended to look affronted, gasping, \u201cMe? How dare you assume that I\u2019m up to something? You know what they say about assuming...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m keeping my eye on you,\u201d I told him, and he only laughed at me and finished eating.</p><p>He helped clean up the kitchen and just as we were about to sit down in the living room, there was a knock at the door.</p><p>Ian went to answer it, stepping back and letting my brother inside.</p> <p>\u201cSince when do you lock the door?\u201d he asked me.</p><p>\u201cUh, since the last time you walked in here unannounced and...well, you know what happened.\u201d I could feel my face turning red, even though it\u2019d been a while since.</p><p>Calland visibly cringed and shuddered. \u201cYeah. Truth. Thanks for reminding me of the reason I willingly gave up my key.\u201d</p><p>See, Ian and I were getting busy on the kitchen counter one afternoon and Calland dropped in. Needless to say, he got an eyeful of Ian\u2019s bare ass (thankfully that\u2019s all he saw) and hightailed it out like his own ass was on fire. I hadn\u2019t been able to look him in the eye after that until just recently.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d I asked him, thinking it a little weird that he was at my house, alone, on a Friday night.</p><p>He blew out a breath and moved past me, falling onto the couch and saying, \u201cI think I\u2019m in trouble.\u201d</p><p>I glanced at Ian, seeing the same surprise etched on his face that I knew was on mine. We both sat back down, Ian in the recliner, and me on the couch beside Calland as I asked, \u201cWhat do you mean, you think you\u2019re in trouble? Calland, what\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know that girl I\u2019ve been seeing?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLucy?\u201d I asked him, hedging on the name. I can\u2019t keep track of all the different ones he dates all the time.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cLily, but nice try. Okay, so you remember the girl I dated before that?\u201d</p><p>I raised my hands, shrugging and shaking my head as I tried to think. \u201cI don\u2019t know, Fluffy? Muffin?\u201d (To my credit, I managed to keep a straight face while teasing him.)</p><p>He glared at me. \u201cHa ha, funny. No, Grace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Calland, I don\u2019t really remember. I can\u2019t keep all your women straight. Have you thought about settling down? Maybe keeping one for longer than a month or two?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, got jokes tonight, huh?\u201d he said, then turned to Ian and asked, \u201cHow the hell do you put up with her?\u201d</p><p>Ian just grinned and replied, \u201cCause she\u2019s awesome and I love her.\u201d</p><p>Calland pretended to gag. \u201cAnyway, so I just found out that Grace is Lily\u2019s sister.\u201d</p><p>I stayed silent for a moment, letting the logistics of that sink in. \u201cSo, you dated Grace. Now you\u2019re dating Lily, and they\u2019re sisters. I mean, that\u2019s kinda low, moving from one sister to the next, Calland. I mean, what the hell is Grace saying about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d he hedged, \u201cThat\u2019s where the trouble is. I just found out. I knew Grace had a sister, but they didn\u2019t get along the greatest. I never met her, never knew what her name was. But then Lily was just talking about her sister, who\u2019s named Grace, and how they\u2019ve gotten closer lately and she\u2019s so happy about it.\u201d</p><p>Ian chimed in. \u201cSo? There\u2019s a lot of Graces in the world. How do you know that she\u2019s talking about the Grace you were just seeing?\u201d</p><p>Calland sighed. \u201cMaybe because she showed me a picture of her sister who apparently is so heartbroken over the douchecanoe that broke up with her a couple months ago. I\u2019m not kidding. She held up the picture and asked me, \u2018Look? Isn\u2019t she so pretty? How could that ass just toss her away like that? She said he\u2019s already dating some other skank. Can you believe it?\u2019\u201d</p><p>I snorted, trying to contain my laughter, but failed miserably because he had raised his voice and delivered \u201cLily\u2019s\u201d speech in a creepy, valley-girl inspired falsetto. \u201cPlease tell me that\u2019s not how she really sounds?\u201d I asked him, mockingly.</p><p>\u201cDoes it matter? How the hell do you tell the girl you\u2019re seeing that the skank who\u2019s dating her sister\u2019s ex is her?\u201d Calland threw his hands up and sat forward on the couch, running his hands through his hair agitatedly.</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d</p><p>He glared at me. \u201cIs that all you have to say? Wow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want me to say, Calland? You\u2019re 29 and practically a confirmed bachelor. You\u2019re a serial dater who always seems to find the most vapid females around to date. What you need is to find a good woman who won\u2019t put up with your shit, and who\u2019ll knock you down a peg or two when you need it.\u201d I cocked my head at him and widened my eyes as I continued, \u201cWhich is always.\u201d</p><p>He curled his lip up at me. \u201cGod, you sound like Mom. But that\u2019s not going to solve my problem right now. What do I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna have to tell her the truth. You can\u2019t keep dating her after just breaking her sister\u2019s heart. What are you gonna do when she wants to double date with her sister? When she wants you to set her sister up with a friend?\u201d I asked him.</p><p>\u201cI know...\u201d he replied, sounding glum.</p><p>\u201cWell if you know, then why\u2019d you come here asking me for advice?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI really didn\u2019t come for advice. I just needed an alibi since I told her I couldn\u2019t go out with her tonight because I promised I\u2019d come over here for dinner and to talk about family stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an ass, Calland,\u201d I told him, shaking my head at him.</p><p>\u201cBut you love me,\u201d was his reply.</p><p>Chapter 8</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re fucking kidding me,\u201d Chloe gasped, her jaw dropping.</p><p>\u201cI wish I was,\u201d I replied, succinctly.</p><p>We were at Allie\u2019s house for the Down &amp; Dirty party, helping her set things up. Allie and Emma were in the kitchen putting together a veggie tray while Chloe and I moved chairs into the living room from the dining room table to make sure there were enough seats for everyone.</p><p>I was filling Chloe in on all the details of what happened with Victoria at Ian\u2019s office yesterday, and while I wasn\u2019t whispering, I wasn\u2019t talking loudly, but that didn\u2019t stop my sister and Allie from stomping into the living room, wiping their hands on paper towels.</p><p>\u201cI heard the name Victoria and I know you aren\u2019t in here telling stories that we can\u2019t hear,\u201d Emma said sternly. Allie stood beside her, nodding her agreement.</p><p>I opened my mouth to say something and the door opened, bringing my mom and oldest sister, Jenna, into the room. They called their hellos, but only got half-assed hellos in response because everyone was still staring at me.</p><p>Chloe gave me a sympathetic look, because I\u2019d already told her I was just gonna fill the rest of my family in at breakfast tomorrow, but...my family, especially the women, are like a dog with a bone when they want to know something. They\u2019d do well in the CIA or the FBI; they\u2019d just talk prisoners to death, or at least into giving up all the information they had.</p><p>My mom\u2019s eagle eye read the situation immediately and turned to me. \u201cWhat are you hiding?\u201d</p><p>I threw my hands up. \u201cI\u2019m not hiding anything! Geez Louise, people!\u201d I sighed. \u201cCan\u2019t a girl have a private conversation with her best friend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeah Nicole...\u201d Mom warned, and I grinned.</p><p>\u201cOkay, my God. I was gonna tell you all at breakfast tomorrow, but just wanted to tell Chloe because she and Brandon can\u2019t make it tomorrow.\u201d I shot Chloe an apologetic look, because I\u2019d just essentially thrown her under the bus.</p><p>My mom picked up on that immediately, too. \u201cChloe? You guys aren\u2019t coming tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>Chloe glared at me and then smiled at my mom, shaking her head regretfully. \u201cNo, we actually already had plans...\u201d she took in my mom\u2019s crestfallen expression and backpedaled. \u201cBut we can move things around and be there!\u201d she said brightly.</p><p>My mom beamed because she\u2019d just gotten her way. \u201cGood, that means everyone will be there, including your mom and her...and T.J. and Allie\u2019s parents, too.\u201d</p><p>Chloe\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cMy mom and her what, Mrs. Jensen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, blah. I\u2019ve told you time and time again, call me Jan. Mrs. Jensen was my mother-in-law. And, nothing, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m talking about. Don\u2019t mind the ramblings of an old woman. Now, Leah, you tell us right now what you\u2019re hiding.\u201d</p><p>And just like that, my mom had effectively closed that subject.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t hiding anything, I promise,\u201d I began, and then told them everything that had happened with Victoria.</p><p>With all that finally out of the way, we got back to setting up for the party. Chloe and I headed to Allie\u2019s office to start dragging out her tubs of stuff and getting it all laid out on the table she had set up in front of the fireplace.</p> <p>Chloe was arranging the wide array of dildos, cock rings, vibrators, bullets, and other interesting items designed to make you scream alongside the bottles, jars, and tubes containing creams, lotions, powders, and lubes of all types for whatever you could imagine, while I went back to get the star of the show, Big Kirky.</p><p>I was a little apprehensive lugging him into the living room, because, well...I honestly didn\u2019t know what kind of crazy thing Nanny would pop off with when she saw him. Big Kirky was an eighteen inch tall, ten inch diameter, jelly-type dildo, complete with veins and balls, and the thing weighed like ten pounds.</p><p>Allie joked around about using him for a door stop (which I think she actually did at one point), but really she had just gotten him for the shock factor when she started selling Down &amp; Dirty. I\u2019ve been to a few of her parties over the past few years, and he\u2019s always been the ice breaker, for sure.</p><p>Thankfully, Nannny had gone into the kitchen with Daisy and my mom, so I made my way over to Chloe, calling out for her to clear a spot for Big Kirky. She shook her head and laughed as she did so, then laughed even harder at the thump he made when I set him down.</p><p>We moved back from the table and studied our handiwork, satisfied that we\u2019d remembered to set up everything like Allie had asked us to.</p><p>She came into the living room, holding a stack of catalogs and pens in her hands. When she saw the table, she nodded to us. \u201cThank you, you two! Looks great! I guess we\u2019re ready?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged, looking around. I didn\u2019t see anything else that needed to be done. The front door opened and Jackson walked in.</p><p>\u201cJesus...\u201d he muttered as his eyes went directly to the table we\u2019d set up. \u201cI forgot about that thing.\u201d</p><p>Allie just grinned and lifted her face to meet his kiss. \u201cWhat are you doing here? The party is getting ready to start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I just forgot to grab extra diapers to refill the diaper bag with and wanted to get them before everyone got here,\u201d Jackson called over his shoulder as he headed upstairs. He was back downstairs in an instant, clutching a handful of diapers.</p><p>Emma walked out of the kitchen munching on a carrot stick and almost ran into him as he stepped off the stairs. \u201cOoh. Sorry, Jacks,\u201d she said, patting his chest fondly and moving away from him. She stopped and turned back to him, her eyes narrowing.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019d you come from?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cThis is my house, you know,\u201d he said, drolly.</p><p>\u201cSmart ass,\u201d she muttered. \u201cYou know what I mean. Is everything okay with Luke and Everly?\u201d</p><p>Since the party was at Allie and Jacks\u2019 house, all the guys, along with the babies, were hanging at Luke and Emma\u2019s house.</p><p>\u201cChill, mama bear, everything\u2019s fine,\u201d Jackson said to her. \u201cI just needed to grab some diapers.\u201d</p><p>Emma looked confused. \u201cYou could have just grabbed one of Everly\u2019s. She just moved up to the same size as Liam. Why\u2019d Luke make you walk over here just for diapers?\u201d</p><p>Allie interjected with, \u201cYeah, what she said. You checking up on us?\u201d</p><p>Jackson gave her a look and said, \u201cNo, woman. I\u2019m not checking up on you. I\u2019m also NOT putting my SON in one of Everly\u2019s diapers. They\u2019re girly!\u201d</p><p>Emma screwed her face up at him. \u201cWhat? They aren\u2019t girly, they\u2019re just normal diapers,\u201d she said, looking at him like he\u2019d lost his mind.</p><p>\u201cThey have Minnie Mouse on them!\u201d Jackson exclaimed, looking affronted that it was even suggested he use a diaper depicting a female cartoon character on his son.</p><p>Emma rolled her eyes and said, \u201cThey also have Mickey Mouse on them.\u201d She turned to Allie. \u201cYour husband...\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Allie just laughed. \u201cI know, but I love him,\u201d she said, lifting her face to receive a kiss from him again as he moved past her on his way to leave.</p><p>Jackson kissed her and waved hello/goodbye to everyone as Nanny and the moms came out of the kitchen and filed into the living room.</p><p>\u201cHoly giant ballsack!\u201d Nanny crowed, blinking her eyes at Big Kirky.</p><p>Jackson practically ran for the door, hollering bye again as he slammed it behind him. Which was a good thing, considering the comments that flew from Nanny\u2019s mouth afterwards.</p><p>\u201cAllie-girl, tell me you don\u2019t get up on that thing!\u201d Nanny called in her gravelly voice, her eyes still locked on the giant dildo. She didn\u2019t give Allie a chance to answer. \u201cBack in my day, I could probab-\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom!\u201d Daisy yelled, trying to distract her.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Nanny snapped back at her. \u201cI\u2019m just sayin\u2019, I might have been able-\u201d</p><p>The doorbell rang and we all practically sighed in relief.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get it!\u201d Allie said brightly, rubbing her forehead with her fingers as she moved to answer the door. \u201cWhat the hell did we get ourselves into?\u201d she whispered to Chloe and me as she passed us.</p><p>We just grinned at each other.</p><p>Within the next half an hour, the living room was almost full of women, most of which I was either related to, or might as well have been, for how close we were. Chloe and I were sitting cross-legged on the floor, Emma and Jenna on the loveseat behind us. My mom was sitting with Daisy, Nanny, and Chloe\u2019s mom, Sarah, on the couch. All of the other ladies, a mixture of friends and neighbors, were seated randomly on chairs placed around the room, or on the floor like us. Altogether, there were about sixteen of us, which would make for a pretty good party for Allie.</p><p>Allie stood in the middle of the room, right in front of the table, and started her \u201cshow.\u201d She kicked it off with a couple of games, one of which included tossing glow necklaces around Big Kirky in a wacky, adult version of the ring toss game. Once the games were over, Allie had given out a couple of prizes (go me! I won a mini variety pack of warming, flavored massage oils), and then we moved on to the non-sex-toy section of the catalog.</p><p>We passed around the pots, jars, creams, and all that good stuff as Allie told us about each of the products. I found a new body butter that smelled absolutely delicious and earmarked that page to order some. Once we\u2019d all sampled everything (laughing through most of it, if not because of the things Allie was saying, but because of Nanny), Allie invited everyone to take a break and get some goodies from the kitchen.</p><p>With a glass of wine and a plate piled high with buffalo chicken dip, chips, veggies, dip, and mini cherry cheesecakes, I settled back down on the floor with Chloe to wait for everyone else to come back in.</p><p>She leaned back against the couch and popped a bite of buffalo dip in her mouth, chewing thoughtfully as she looked at me.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked?</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t get to finish our talk. What are you going to do about the bitch?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cI have no idea. Ian said he was going to call his parents, and hers, to let them know just what she\u2019s been up to. I mean, she\u2019s done the whole naked thing before. I\u2019ve seen her naked more than I have myself, I swear,\u201d I said with a snort. \u201cBut, Chloe, the look in her eyes was something I\u2019d never seen before. I\u2019ve never thought she was stupid, but I never thought she was smart. Do you know what I mean?\u201d</p><p>Chloe nodded as she sipped her wine.</p><p>\u201cI just think something has snapped in her head. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s going to stop unless she\u2019s forced to. Geez, can you imagine us trying to get a restraining order against her?\u201d I shook my head, picturing it. \u201cExcuse me, can I please get a CPO against this crazy bitch who keeps showing up at my boyfriend\u2019s house and office, naked and wearing a hard hat? They\u2019d laugh me out of the courthouse.\u201d</p><p>Chloe tipped her head to the side in half-hearted agreement, but before she could reply, the women started trickling back in. \u201cWe\u2019ll get together this week so we can talk,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>I nodded quickly, and we shared a smile before I turned to ask my sister, Jenna, how my baby nephew was doing. We all chatted while we ate and when we were finished, Allie jumped back up in front to start the \u201cfun\u201d part of the fun party.</p><p>She held up her catalog, opened to the first page of toys, but before she could say anything, Nanny opened her mouth and rendered the room silent.</p> <p>\u201cAllie-girl, start with that ginormous piece of man meat you\u2019ve got thumped on the table! You know, if I ever used something like that, your Poppy would have to strap a board across my ass so he wouldn\u2019t fall in! Whoo-wee!\u201d</p><p>The silence lasted for point-two seconds and then the room roared with laughter, over which Daisy could be heard groaning, \u201cOh, God no, Mom...\u201d</p><p>Poor Allie just covered her face with her hands and shook her head, but we could see her shoulders shaking with laughter.</p><p>Chapter 9</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d the party go?\u201d Ian asked a couple hours later in the car.</p><p>A rueful laugh escaped in answer. \u201cIt was interesting, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d I said.</p><p>Ian chuckled. \u201cYeah, Jackson looked half spooked when he came back from getting diapers. Said Nanny and that\u2019s all it took. We didn\u2019t need to hear anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup. I wish I hadn\u2019t heard more...Good Lord, that woman\u2019s a handful!\u201d I replied, but with fondness.</p><p>He reached over and took my hand, lacing our fingers together and bringing them up to his mouth. He kissed the back of my hand and then rested our entwined hands on his thigh.</p><p>I laid my head back against the seat and just looked at him, drinking in the sexy hotness of him in the dim light of the dash and the passing street lights.</p><p>I saw the corner of his mouth quirk up, and without looking at me, he asked, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cNothing. Just looking at you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWeirdo,\u201d he said, squeezing my hand briefly.</p><p>He held my hand on his thigh the whole way home, only releasing me when we pulled into the garage and parked. I got out, grabbing my black plastic bag full of goodies I\u2019d bought from Allie from the floor to take inside.</p><p>I was a little shocked that Ian hadn\u2019t asked what I bought the whole way home, but I knew his curiosity would get the best of him sooner rather than later.</p><p>Five seconds later, I realized I shouldn\u2019t have been shocked, and that I was right on the money. He held the door open for me to pass by him into the kitchen and as I did, he grabbed the bag out of my hand and took off through the house.</p><p>\u201cIan!\u201d I yelled, dropping my purse on the counter and stepping out of my heels before following him down the hallway to the bedroom. I didn\u2019t chase him; what was the point? I knew where he was going and, trust me, he definitely was gonna want me with him when he started trying things out.</p><p>Er, at least I\u2019d hope so. If not, that could end up being kinda awkward...</p><p>I stopped in the doorway of the bedroom and looked in to see him lounging on the bed, the bag beside him, still closed.</p><p>I quirked a questioning brow at him and leaned against the door frame, crossing my arms over my chest.</p><p>\u201cWhatcha doing?\u201d I asked him conversationally.</p><p>He leaned on one elbow and crossed his legs, mocking me, I guess. \u201cNot much. What are you doing?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNothing, really,\u201d I replied mildly.</p><p>He lifted his chin in a nonchalant nod. \u201cSounds pretty boring.\u201d</p><p>I gave him a one-shouldered shrug and stayed where I was. He reached out his hand and patted the bed beside him, jerking his head at me. I just smiled and stayed put. He jerked his head again and patted the bed once more, then rubbed his hand over it.</p><p>I sighed and dropped my arms, slouching toward the bed. \u201cOh, alright...\u201d</p><p>He reached out and pulled me down on to the bed beside him, tossing the bag at me. \u201cShow me,\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m shocked you haven\u2019t looked already,\u201d I mused, sitting up and dumping the contents of the bag on the bed between us.</p><p>He poked around, lifting each item and reading the label before he\u2019d throw it back down. By the time he\u2019d gone through everything, he was scowling.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t get anything fun?\u201d he asked, borderline pouting.</p><p>I gathered up the body butter and the massage oil pack and other little things I\u2019d bought, putting them back in the bag. \u201cMassage oil is fun,\u201d I hedged, but his face just looked even more crestfallen.</p><p>\u201cAre you really that upset that I didn\u2019t get a new toy for us to explore?\u201d I asked him, watching his face.</p><p>He smiled and shook his head. \u201cNah, just messing around with you, baby. You know I don\u2019t need anything to make you come hard.\u201d He winked and his smile turned cocky, his eyes gleaming with a mixture of humor and lust.</p><p>\u201cMmmm...that\u2019s so true. I actually did get something, but it\u2019s in my purse. You jumped the gun, there, honey,\u201d I told him, giving him a sly wink as I slid off the bed.</p><p>He leaned over and smacked my ass. \u201cWell, get your ass in gear and go get it!\u201d</p><p>It didn\u2019t take me long to retrieve my purse and dig out the small, wrapped package from the side pocket. I tossed it to Ian when I walked back in the room and watched him look at it, perplexed.</p><p>\u201cUh, that\u2019s awfully small, don\u2019t you think?\u201d he asked, turning it over in his hands. \u201cAnd flat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOpen it,\u201d I told him, crawling onto the bed beside him.</p><p>He opened the package carefully and pulled it out, looking even more confused. \u201cIt\u2019s...an MP3 player?\u201d</p><p>I sighed and took it from him, unwrapping the wires and showing him exactly what it was. \u201cThis cuff goes around the wrist, which is where the controls are. These little things go on your fingertips, the wires connect them to the control and...\u201d I pressed the two ear bud-looking things into his palm and hit the on button. \u201cVoila! It\u2019s a fingertip massager.\u201d</p><p>His hand jerked and then closed around the vibrating pads. \u201cMmmm...I see potential here,\u201d he said. \u201cA little limiting, though.\u201d</p><p>I just smiled. \u201cNope. Waterproof. Can go in and out.\u201d I took it from him and set it on the nightstand beside the bed before I stood and started playing with the hem of my shirt. \u201cMaybe you should strip,\u201d I told him softly, slowly edging the bottom of my shirt up over my stomach.</p><p>His eyes darkened, watching every move of my hands. He rose from the bed and pulled his shirt off in one fluid movement, his gaze never wavering from mine. He tossed it to the floor and unbuttoned his jeans with one hand, unzipping them with the other, then hooked his fingers in the waistband and shoved them off, kicking them away.</p><p>His erection sprang free of the confining denim to stand proudly at attention, every thick, velvety-steel inch of him beckoning my touch. Instead of reaching for him like I wanted, I quickly divested myself of my clothes until we were both standing naked on opposite sides of the bed.</p><p>I grabbed the massager and slid the cuff on my wrist, then fixed the finger pads to my middle and forefingers.</p> <p>Ian put one knee on the bed, but I stopped him with a quick shake of my head, crooking a finger at him to call him to me. He sauntered over, his hand sliding down his rock hard abs to curl over the gorgeous length jutting from his body, stroking it slowly. My lips tipped up in a smile and I watched his eyes darken even more when I slid to my knees on the floor in front of him.</p><p>\u201cLeah,\u201d he breathed, his voice low and deep, thick with desire.</p><p>With my free hand, I pushed his fingers away, leaning in and capturing the head of him in my lips, rubbing my tongue over the ridge on the underside of his cock, eliciting a rough groan from him. I dropped my hand to my wrist and thumbed on the vibration, the pads on my fingertips thrumming to life.</p><p>I returned my free hand to the base of him, wrapping my fingers firmly around his girth, and brought my other hand up, lightly tracing the vibrating pads up and down his hardened length as I continued to suck and tongue the knobbed head of him. He jerked at the first touch of them on that ultra-sensitive skin, unconsciously feeding more of his cock into my mouth and I sucked harder, making him moan louder.</p><p>I took him deeper, my jaw stretching wide to accommodate the largeness of him, breathing through my nose as I fought my gag reflex until he was touching the back of my throat. I swallowed around him, making him twitch and jerk against my lips, his breathing harsh in the silence. His hands lifted and fisted in my hair, one on either side of my head, holding me in place for just a moment longer before he tugged gently, pulling me back and slipping out of my mouth.</p><p>I made a sound of protest in my throat and pushed forward again, the slight sting of his fingers tangling in my hair sending a thrill down my spine. I set a rhythm, sliding him in and out of my mouth, using my free hand to follow my mouth and stroke him, twisting my hand up and down his shaft as I sucked the swollen head, moaning at the salty-sweet tang of precum on my tongue and drowning in the intoxicating, all male, musky scent of him.</p><p>He gasped my name and I cut my eyes up, watching him through my lashes, his eyes blazing into mine. \u201cTouch yourself, baby,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>I complied, sliding the two fingers tipped with the soft vibrating pads down my body and into my cleft, moaning against Ian\u2019s skin as they skimmed over my clit, through the copious moisture gathered between my thighs, dripping down the inside of them.</p><p>His breath hissed out between his teeth as he watched, his hips taking up the rhythm I\u2019d set, thrusting against my mouth. It wasn\u2019t long until I was squirming against my own fingers, the pulse of the small buds rippling through me, pushing me closer and closer to that razor edge of ecstasy. I could tell that Ian was getting close, as well, his hips beginning to thrust wildly, his hands tightening more and more in my hair. I dragged my fingers back up over my clit, shuddering at the sensation, but not allowing myself to finish.</p><p>I had other plans for those fingers at the moment...plans I carried out with spectacular results.</p><p>Ian\u2019s head dropped back, his mouth open, low sounds emanating from his lips as I worked him with my mouth and my un-wired hand harder, faster, urging him toward the finish line. I felt him swell against my tongue, becoming impossibly larger, ready to explode and at just that moment, I pressed my two vibrating digits, still wet from my body, firmly against his perineum, that smooth strip of flesh just behind his balls.</p><p>Ian\u2019s body went rigid as the pulsing pressure rocketed through him, sending him over the edge immediately, his voice echoing through the room as he shouted, \u201cHoly FUCK!\u201d He pressed my head into his hips, lodging his cock in my throat as he came hard and fast, pulsing on my tongue, guttural cries being wrenched from his lips as I swallowed around him, drinking him down. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I kept my fingers pressed against him, the vibrations feeding his release, and moved my head against the pressure of his hands, sliding him free of my mouth, only to slip him back inside, sucking and licking, until every drop had been wrung from him and he was twitching against me, his legs trembling with the effort to keep standing.</p><p>His voice came above me, hoarse and low. \u201cNo more...oh, God, Leah.\u201d</p><p>I released him, thumbed off the vibration of the pads strapped to my fingers, and sat back on my heels, watching and smiling with smug satisfaction as he staggered and collapsed on the bed, breathing heavily.</p><p>My thighs clenched against the throbbing ache that had settled deep into my sex, and I shifted to my feet, stripping the device off my wrist and dropping it back onto the nightstand before I slid onto the bed beside Ian, pressing my breasts against his side and leaning in to kiss his jaw. He turned his head and captured my lips, his tongue tangling with mine in a deep kiss.</p><p>I broke from it on a sigh, unable to stop my body from shifting restlessly on the mattress.</p><p>Ian stared at me, his eyes still dark and shining with a heady mixture of love, lust, and satisfaction. \u201cBeautiful girl...my God, you\u2019re amazing.\u201d</p><p>I felt his words on my skin like a caress, shivering against him. He moved, reaching up to cup my cheek. \u201cYou\u2019re ready to explode, aren\u2019t you, baby?\u201d</p><p>I jerked a shoulder, but my body betrayed me, my thighs clenching tightly again. He slid his hand down and curled it around my thigh, pulling gently as he urged, \u201cCome here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIan...\u201d I whispered, but he narrowed his eyes, giving me a look that had heat tingling through my veins, pooling low in my belly.</p><p>\u201cBaby, come here. Right now, you\u2019re gonna get up here and I\u2019m gonna eat your sweet pussy until you come all over my face. And then when I\u2019m ready, I\u2019m gonna spread you wide and fuck you hard and fast until you scream.\u201d</p><p>Need surged through me and I complied, moving to straddle him. His hands slid under my ass, pulling me forward. I shifted with him, letting him move me where he wanted me until I was kneeling over his head, my glistening, soaked folds hovering over his mouth. I gasped as I felt the tip of his tongue just barely circle the engorged nub of my clit and then a jagged cry broke from my lips as his hands curled around my thighs, spreading them even wider as he pulled me down onto his mouth.</p><p>He ate at me voraciously, burying his face in the hot, silken flesh of my sex, his tongue spearing into my entrance, thrusting in and out and then swiping up to circle my clit again, closing his mouth over it and sucking, pulling it into his mouth and gently biting, sending sharp spirals of pleasure through my core.</p><p>He kept up his assault on my tender flesh, his fingers digging into my thighs as he held me down on his mouth, working me with his tongue until I broke, crying out my release as I flooded him with sweet honey. He lapped up every drop as I ground my pelvis down on him, shuddering and gasping, breathless with the piercing bliss washing over me until I was boneless and sated.</p><p>I carefully slid to the side, collapsing in a heap beside him as he gathered me in his arms, his lips finding mine and stealing what little breath I had left with a sweet kiss. When he finally released my mouth, we laid there entwined with each other in the silence broken only by our ragged breathing.</p><p>Then when we\u2019d come down enough, he rolled, nudging my thighs apart and settling his hips between them before he pressed inside me and did everything he promised he would.</p><p>And then some.</p><p>Chapter 10</p><p>I rolled over and silenced the alarm blaring through the room, effectively silencing a groaning Ian, too.</p><p>He pulled me into his arms and tucked me back into his side, grumbling in my hair, \u201cWhy the hell did you set the alarm clock on a Sunday?\u201d</p><p>I patted his shoulder and kissed his chest, yawning as I answered, \u201cBreakfast at Mom and Dad\u2019s, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod...\u201d he groaned again, burying his face against me further.</p><p>We\u2019d been up most of the night, both of us taking turns exploring each other with the new toy I\u2019d gotten from Allie\u2019s party last night (I was lucky, it was the only one she\u2019d had with her), neither one of us remembering, or even caring for that matter, that we had to be up early to be at my parents\u2019 house. Thank God I\u2019d set my alarm earlier that evening before we\u2019d left just to be sure I wouldn\u2019t forget, or there would have been hell to pay.</p><p>I could only imagine my mother stomping into my house, into the bedroom, whipping the covers off of us (naked or not), and screeching at us to get our asses in gear. Because she\u2019d do it, just to make sure all of her babies were together for breakfast, especially since we hadn\u2019t done it in a while.</p> <p>I cuddled closer to Ian for a moment longer, then pulled away, sliding out of bed and stretching before I walked into the bathroom to take care of business. I stepped into the shower, the steam billowing around me, making me moan as the hot water pounded down on muscles sore from the vigorous activities of the previous night. I was halfway through my shower routine before I realized that Ian had never stumbled into the room.</p><p>\u201cIan!\u201d I hollered, my voice echoing through the room. \u201cYou have to get up!\u201d</p><p>I laughed as I heard him growl then yell back, \u201cI\u2019m awake! Isn\u2019t that enough?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I shouted back. \u201cGet moving, we\u2019re gonna be late!\u201d</p><p>Forty-five minutes later, we were showered, dressed, and pulling into my parents\u2019 driveway. \u201cDamnit,\u201d I muttered under my breath, realizing that we were the last ones to arrive. We hurried inside, calling out hellos, counting it as a minor blessing that they hadn\u2019t started eating yet. Most of them were all sitting in the living room, with the exception of Emma, Jenna, Mom, and Daisy, Allie\u2019s mom.</p><p>I glanced around, looking for Chloe (since my mom had guilted her into coming today), noticing that she wasn\u2019t in the room, either, but Brandon was, sitting beside a man that I\u2019d never seen before. I raised an eyebrow at him in question and he just gave a barely perceptive shake of his head, telling me silently that he\u2019d tell me later. I glanced up at Ian to see him watching Brandon with the same inquisitive expression that I had, but let it go. Ian joined Luke, Brandon, and the stranger on the couch, saying hi to Noah, who was sitting on the loveseat with Jackson, holding Caleb. Allie, her dad, and Calland were on the floor with Everly, Liam, and Hayden, while Jarrod sat on the arm of my dad\u2019s recliner, showing him some kind of handheld game. I waved to everyone and then walked into the kitchen to tell my mom, sisters, and Daisy hello.</p><p>\u201cLeah, hi, honey!\u201d Mom said when I entered the room, not giving me a chance to speak. \u201cDo me a favor and have one of the guys open this jar for me. I can\u2019t get it open!\u201d</p><p>She thrust a jar of strawberry jam at me and turned back to the stove. Jenna was standing at the counter pouring batter into muffin pans, and Emma was at the toaster, toasting what looked like a whole loaf of bread.</p><p>\u201cOooh, we\u2019re having popovers?\u201d I asked as I gripped the jar and turned the lid, giving my mom a WTF look when it popped right off in my hand.</p><p>She just sighed and shook her head. \u201cI couldn\u2019t get it open. Don\u2019t judge me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Chloe?\u201d I asked the room in general. \u201cAnd who\u2019s the dude on the couch?\u201d</p><p>Before I got an answer, my niece Hayden ran into the room, shouting. \u201cMommy, Daddy said he needs your boobies, please.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jenna let out an exasperated sound and motioned me over. \u201cHere, take over. Apparently, my \u2018boobies\u2019 are required at the moment.\u201d She turned to her daughter. \u201cHayden, come on. Stay out of Mamaw\u2019s way. And did your Daddy actually tell you to come in here and say boobies?\u201d</p><p>Hayden followed her, and we all bit our tongues to contain our laughter at the conversation that followed as they left the room.</p><p>Hayden replied, \u201cUhhh...well, he told me to come get you and tell you that the baby was hungry.\u201d Then she asked her mom, \u201cCan I help feed him?\u201d</p><p>Jenna sounded resigned as she answered, \u201cNot right now, Hayden. Remember? You can only help when your brother is drinking from his bottle, but Mommy has to use her boobies this time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI could still help, Mommy. I could hold your boobie like I hold the bottle when I feed him other times. You know, like Daddy holds your boobies sometimes.\u201d</p><p>There was a pause and then Jenna said, \u201cOh, I hear Jarrod calling for you. Is he outside? You better go check to see what he wants...\u201d</p><p>I glanced over to see Daisy\u2019s and Emma\u2019s shoulders shaking uncontrollably, same as my mother\u2019s, and I couldn\u2019t hold it in any longer. A shout of laughter burst out of me, followed by a snort from Emma, and then we all lost it, laughing until we had to wipe our eyes.</p><p>Chloe and her mom entered the chaos of the kitchen, looking at us like we\u2019d lost our minds until I recapped the conversation we\u2019d just witnessed, amid bouts of giggling, until they were both laughing right along with us.</p><p>I finished filling the muffin pans and took them to my mom who popped them into the oven. That done, I leaned against the counter beside Chloe, asking, \u201cWhere were you when I came in? And where\u2019s T.J.?\u201d</p> <p>She gave her mom a look that I couldn\u2019t decipher and answered wryly, \u201cT.J. said he had something to take care of but sent his regrets and regards. And I was talking to my mother outside. She was explaining that little slip-up your mom almost had last night at the party.\u201d</p><p>I turned my head to look at my mom, who just shrugged. \u201cI made a promise. I kept it. But it doesn\u2019t matter now, anyway. Sarah spilled the beans herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOhhh-kaaayy...?\u201d I drew the word out, getting more confused by the second.</p><p>Chloe took pity on me. \u201cDid you see the guy in the living room?\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s my mom\u2019s boyfriend,\u201d Chloe said. \u201cMy mom was hiding him from us because she was afraid that Jackson and I would be upset. Your mom introduced them at the grocery store a few weeks ago.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWho the hell is he, Mom?\u201d I asked her. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen him before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI met him at the doctor\u2019s office when I was there for my checkup. He was nice. Sarah and I were at the store together a few weeks ago and ran into him, and...well, the rest is history,\u201d Mom said, waving her hand in the air like it was no big deal.</p><p>Emma jumped in. \u201cSo, basically what Mom is saying, is that she was picking up random dudes at the doctor\u2019s office.\u201d</p><p>Mom swatted Emma\u2019s ass. \u201cYou\u2019re not too old, you know. I brought you into this world and I WILL take you out,\u201d she said, glaring at her, but the twinkle in her eyes have her away.</p><p>Emma rolled her eyes. \u201cYeah, yeah, yeah. How many times did we hear that growing up?\u201d she asked me. \u201cAnd we\u2019re still all alive.\u201d</p><p>Mom smacked her again. \u201cThat can change in an instant,\u201d she growled, but ruined the effect by laughing.</p><p>Sarah laughed and then took over the conversation. \u201cHis name is John, he\u2019s a doctor, and he\u2019s widowed with two grown children of his own, but they live in different states. And he\u2019s very, very nice.\u201d</p><p>Her face was beaming, and I caught Chloe looking at her, her gaze soft with happiness.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why she was so worried about us knowing she was dating. It makes me happy to know that she\u2019s got someone of her own now. Jacks and I always hoped she\u2019d find someone. So, no more secrets, right Mom?\u201d she asked firmly, pointing her finger at her mom. She turned to my mom then. \u201cJan?\u201d</p><p>Mom and Sarah shared a look and grinned. We could only shake our heads.</p><p>\u201cAlright,\u201d my mom said, changing the subject with a clap of her hands. \u201cLet\u2019s get this shit on the table and feed everyone, yeah?\u201d</p><p>Breakfast went as it most always did; loud, chaotic, and loaded with hilarity. Calland did as he always does and aggravated Emma non-stop. But don\u2019t think that he didn\u2019t get Jenna and me just as much, because he did. He just chose to pick on Emma that much more because she always got so pissed off at him, which meant everything ended up being ten times funnier than it would have been. Take, for example, the time that Emma and Calland fought over the leftover scalloped potatoes my mom had made. They ended up in the driveway with Emma stomping her feet and Calland licking the whole bowl of potatoes just so Emma wouldn\u2019t take them. Of course, they didn\u2019t know that there were double the amount of potatoes and I\u2019d already filled and hidden a bowl of my own. I learned real quick to be smart like that as the youngest.</p><p>Anyway, Calland took Emma\u2019s bacon, Emma squealed, got more, he took that bacon, too, and so on and so forth. Luke shut it down, finally, by giving Emma the napkin full of bacon he\u2019d already grabbed and stored by his plate. He was smart, too, because he knew how to keep his wife happy. Given the look she sent him, she was planning on making him pretty happy later.</p><p>I\u2019d caught Ian\u2019s eye as he sat across the table from me, his eyes warm and bright, enjoying the loud banter and the complete chaos that was my family, and it filled my heart even more, just as it did every time I watched him interacting with my family and friends. And just as always, I counted my lucky stars because I still couldn\u2019t believe that he was mine, that he loved me.</p><p>We\u2019d hung out a little while longer once everyone was done eating and the mess had been cleared away, but eventually took our leave when Chloe and Brandon did.</p><p>\u201cSo, John is nice,\u201d I hedged to Chloe, feeling her out.</p><p>\u201cHe is. I don\u2019t know why Mom was so worried about Jacks and I. Seriously, our father left a long time ago. I\u2019d have been happy for my mom to have met someone back when we lived in L.A., but she always seemed content with just us. I don\u2019t know, I guess now that we\u2019re all here, and she knows that we\u2019re settled and beyond happy,\u201d she looked over at Brandon and I could see her feeling written clearly across her face, \u201cshe can focus on maybe finding that happiness for herself.\u201d</p><p>Brandon winked at Chloe, his face echoing perfectly everything that Chloe\u2019s had. They\u2019d had a bit of a rough start, since Brandon and Jacks both were with Allie before Chloe had come to town, but long story short, things worked out the way they should have, and it was clear to anyone who was around them that they were totally and irrevocably in love with each other, same as my sister and Luke, and Allie and Jacks.</p><p>\u201cWell, what are you two kids up to now, since you had to change your plans around?\u201d I nudged Chloe with my shoulder to get her attention, but Brandon\u2019s the one that answered me.</p><p>\u201cWe were going to go down to Newport to walk around the aquarium and get something to eat down there afterwards, but instead, when T.J. gets done, we\u2019re just gonna meet him up at the lake to take out the new boat he just got.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cT.J. got a boat?\u201d I asked. \u201cHe lives in an apartment, doesn\u2019t he? Where\u2019s he going to keep it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, he bought a house here, too. He got a place over on Vineyard. It\u2019s pretty nice,\u201d Chloe replied.</p><p>I gave a low whistle. \u201cThose houses are very nice over there. Damn. When he settles in, he settles in, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d I said, chuckling.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Chloe said brightly. \u201cHe got a pontoon, so there\u2019s plenty of room. You guys wanna go with us? We\u2019ll probably cookout beside the lake later, too, or get something at one of the places right there by the water. It\u2019ll be fun!\u201d</p> <p>I glanced at Ian and he shrugged, indicating that it was up to me. \u201cYou sure T.J. won\u2019t care?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah,\u201d Brandon said, \u201cWe\u2019re gonna leave in about an hour, so we\u2019ll swing by and just pick you up. Sound good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>Plans in place, we all headed out to get things ready, and an hour later, we were on the road to the lake in Brandon\u2019s Expedition, windows down, radio blasting, enjoying the sunshine and warmth of the last days of summer.</p><p>It took about forty-five minutes to get there and T.J. was already there when we pulled up at the marina. He was on the boat, kicked back with his feet up and his hands behind his head, a ball cap covering his hair and dark sunglasses hiding his eyes.</p> <p>He didn\u2019t move as we walked down the ramp onto the dock, but I could tell he was tracking us by the slight movement of his head.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d he drawled, dropping his hands and getting to his feet as we all boarded the boat.</p><p>The guys shared handshakes and the back-slapping man-hug that was required of them, and then T.J. gave me and Chloe hugs before we got things situated and he put us underway, heading out into the open water of the lake.</p><p>Chloe and I sat up front, while Ian and Brandon sprawled on the \u2018L\u2019 shaped lounger, talking to T.J. as he sat in the captain\u2019s chair, maneuvering the boat across the water. It was a beautiful day, but was starting to get hot and humid.</p><p>I gathered my hair and tied it up on top of my head, not only to cool myself marginally, but also to stop it from whipping around my face like crazy, noticing that Chloe was doing the same with her long, blonde hair.</p><p>We motored around the lake for a bit and then T.J. pulled us into a cove just beyond a line of buoys marked with \u2018Swimming Area\u2019. Brandon got up and moved to the front of the boat, dropping the anchor out for T.J. as I looked back at him and asked, needlessly, \u201cWe\u2019re going swimming?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to?\u201d he asked in response, shutting off the engine.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t say that,\u201d I said, grinning at him. He smiled back and stood, removing his hat and sunglasses, dropping them onto the dash console before he yanked his shirt off, leaving him standing there in nothing but his low riding board shorts.</p><p>Ian and Brandon followed suit, and suddenly, Chloe and I were sitting there, looking at three half-naked, Grade-A Prime, tattooed, pierced, and perfect, hotter-than-hot, males.</p><p>\u201cGod, they\u2019re pretty,\u201d Chloe breathed beside me. I could only nod in agreement.</p><p>We looked at each other and grinned when Brandon cleared his throat and crossed his arms, commenting dryly, \u201cWe\u2019re not just gonna stand here all day for you to ogle.\u201d</p><p>T.J. turned away and opened the gate to the back platform, lowering the ladder into the water. Brandon followed him and jumped in with no hesitation, disappearing beneath the water as Chloe stripped out of her shorts and tank top, revealing a navy and white striped bikini.</p><p>I stripped down to my own blue, green, and white patterned bikini, feeling a pang of pride and relief at how at ease Chloe was with herself now. Last year, Chloe would never have worn anything revealing that would possibly show the scars left behind by her psycho ex, who\u2019d abused her beyond belief, resulting in killing the baby she\u2019d carried and almost Chloe. She\u2019d gotten away, but he found her last year, and kidnapped and tried to kill her once more.</p><p>He ended up six feet under, and Chloe ended up with her happy ever after, which she deserved more than anything. Since then, Brandon had done wonders for her, shown her that she was beautiful, scars and all, which just endeared him to me even more.</p> <p>Chloe moved to the back of the boat and looked for Brandon, who had surfaced a few feet from the boat. She grinned and jumped into the water, swimming directly into his arms once she broke the surface.</p><p>T.J. followed, diving into the water with precision and grace, leaving Ian and I along on the boat. I stepped toward the back, intending to follow them all into the water, but shrieked when Ian scooped me up in his arms suddenly.</p><p>\u201cIan...\u201d I warned, \u201cNo. Don\u2019t you dare throw me in!\u201d I struggled in his arms, but knew better. His hold was too strong, albeit very gentle.</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cYou were about to jump in anyway, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but that\u2019s not the same as being thrown in. You love me, don\u2019t you?\u201d I cajoled in a saccharine sweet voice, batting my eyes at him.</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d he replied, matching my tone. \u201cBut that\u2019s not going to save you.\u201d</p><p>He strode to the back of the boat, stood on the platform and kissed me quickly before he grinned...and tossed me into the water.</p><p>I swam up to the surface, glaring up at him. \u201cYou ass!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you love me,\u201d he said, still grinning unabashedly. Then he jumped in, sending a wave of water splashing up in my face.</p><p>Chapter 11</p><p>We played in the water, splashing and dunking like adolescents, enjoying the company and the freedom of the moment. After a while, I was done swimming, so I climbed back up into the boat and wrapped my towel around me, pulling my hair down from its knot and wringing it out over the side.</p><p>I piled it back up on my head and curled up on the lounger, watching Ian float by on his back, grinning up at me as I looked down at him over the side. I noticed that Brandon and Chloe had gotten quiet, so I chanced a glance over at them, only to smile when I saw Chloe wrapped around Brandon, his hands cupping her ass, faces close as they talked quietly to each other in the water, kissing every so often between words.</p><p>I felt the boat sway and looked back to see T.J. climbing up the ladder. He grabbed a towel and wrapped it around him, plopping down on the other end of the lounger by my feet.</p><p>He smacked my leg playfully and asked me, \u201cHave fun?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cYep. Too bad you waited til the end of summer to get a boat,\u201d I quipped, jokingly.</p><p>A weird look flashed across his face briefly, so quick I wasn\u2019t even sure I really saw it, before it was replaced with a rueful half-smile. \u201cIt is too bad, isn\u2019t it,\u201d he stated in agreement.</p><p>\u201cSo you got a place over on Vineyard, huh?\u201d</p><p>He nodded in response, but didn\u2019t offer any information.</p><p>I glanced back down in the water, watching Ian cut through the water with sure strokes, like he was swimming laps, rather than floating like he had been.</p><p>T.J. and I sat in silence for a bit, but it wasn\u2019t uncomfortable. It was companionable, because I\u2019d been around him so many times before, but I still hadn\u2019t talked to him very much. Most of the guys like Luke, Brandon, and Ian were the strong silent type, but T.J. made them seem like gossip mongers. And he really didn\u2019t ask anyone for anything; he showed up, did his job, or whatever activity we asked him to do with us, and then he went home. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>That\u2019s why I was caught off guard when T.J. broke the silence with a question.</p><p>\u201cChloe said you used to cut hair. Will you cut mine for me?\u201d</p><p>I blinked in surprise, but answered quickly, \u201cYeah, sure. When do you want to do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I come by tonight?\u201d he asked, hesitantly.</p> <p>\u201cOf course! Just swing by after you drop the boat off at home. I\u2019ll have my stuff ready for ya.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>We both looked back at the dip of the boat to see Ian step up off the ladder. I jumped up and reached for his towel, tossing it back to him.</p><p>He caught it with a wink. \u201cThanks, babe.\u201d</p><p>He dried himself off and leaned in, pressing his lips to mine in a quick kiss before he moved past me to take a seat up front, just as Brandon and Chloe made their way into the boat.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s get some grub, man. I\u2019m starving,\u201d Brandon called, his voice muffled under his towel as he dried off his hair.</p><p>We all seconded that, so we headed back to the dock and helped T.J. load and tie down the boat while we discussed what we were going to do for dinner.</p><p>\u201cWe can hit up the little grocery store and go cookout by the water in the park, or check out one of the restaurants around here,\u201d T.J. said. \u201cI\u2019m up for whatever.\u201d</p><p>It didn\u2019t take long to decide just to stop somewhere and eat before heading home. When we were finished, Brandon and Chloe took us home and T.J. stopped by his house to drop off the boat before he came over.</p><p>As soon as we got home, while we were waiting for T.J., Ian and I jumped in the shower to wash the lake water off of us. We\u2019d just gotten out and I was getting dressed when the doorbell rang. Ian, who\u2019d already donned a pair of basketball shorts and a t-shirt, went to answer while I pulled on a pair of cotton shorts and a tank top, grabbing my case with my stylist supplies.</p><p>In short order, Ian was sitting at the kitchen table, and I had T.J. sitting in a chair with a cape snapped around his neck to keep the hair off him, running my fingers through his hair as I asked what he wanted me to do with it.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I think it\u2019s just time for a change.\u201d</p><p>His hair was a long mohawk that he usually spiked up, and it was dyed black, red, and yellow, so it looked almost like flames. His hair, paired with his whiskey colored eyes, only enhanced the striking look of him; seriously, there was no denying that the man was H.O.T.</p><p>\u201cIf I cut it shorter, you\u2019ll have to dye it again, because I\u2019ll end up cutting most of the lighter colors off. You\u2019ll probably just have the red and black left,\u201d I told him, pulling his hair up and measuring with my fingers.</p><p>\u201cYou know what? Just cut it all off,\u201d T.J. said decisively.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure? How about I just cut it short, that way you can still keep the \u2018hawk, just shorter.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything else, so I took it that it was decided. I grabbed my clippers and buzzed the sides down, then took my scissors and cut the length off the rest until he was left with a three inch long mohawk on top. Most of the color was gone; in fact, his hair was black, with just the tips barely showing the red.</p><p>He and Ian had talked a little while I was cutting, mostly about the tattoo shop, Skin Deep, that T.J. was now part owner of with Brandon and Luke, but they\u2019d lapsed into silence the last few minutes.</p> <p>I was running my fingers through his hair, checking to make sure the length was even when he spoke again.</p><p>\u201cThanks for doing this,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>I brushed the hair off the back of his neck and unsnapped the cape. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome. It\u2019s no trouble, really. Next time you need it cut, just let me know.\u201d</p><p>He stood and reached into his back pocket, pulling out his wallet. \u201cHow much do I owe you?</p><p>Ian laughed and shook his head. \u201cDude, don\u2019t. You\u2019re just gonna piss her off.\u201d</p><p>Well, he wasn\u2019t wrong. I stood with my hands on my hips, glaring at T.J. \u201cI don\u2019t want your money. You\u2019re a friend, T.J., practically family. You asked for a favor, I helped you out. I did it because I like you. Get it?\u201d</p><p>He put his hands up in front of him defensively. \u201cAll right, all right...down killer,\u201d he soothed jokingly, his lips curled into a cute little half-smile.</p><p>I dropped my hands and smiled back. \u201cYou know, you should smile more often,\u201d I told him, then cursed myself when his smile disappeared. \u201cI don\u2019t get you, T.J. Conley. You\u2019re so serious all the time, but you let your guard down with us every now and then, just for a second before you slap that baby right back up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeah...\u201d I heard Ian warn softly behind me.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d T.J. interrupted him. \u201cShe\u2019s right. But Chloe\u2019s really the only one who calls me on it. She reminds me of my sister in a way, even though they\u2019re totally different.\u201d</p><p>I sighed. \u201cSee? I didn\u2019t even know you had a sister.\u201d</p><p>He gave me that ghost of a smile again. \u201cWell, I do. But I don\u2019t talk about family.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head at him. \u201cYou don\u2019t talk about anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. It\u2019s better that way. Maybe one day...just not now. But, like I\u2019ve told Brandon, Chloe, Luke, and even your sister, Emma, -who by the way, tried her hand at cracking me open, as well- you guys have opened your lives to me and given me back something that I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d ever have again. Friendship, caring...a home.\u201d He glanced over at Ian. \u201cAnd you\u2019re good people, all of you. The way you guys take care of your women, your families...it warms my heart. And that\u2019s also something that I thought would never happen again. Ever.\u201d</p><p>Ian stepped up and clapped him on the back. \u201cYou\u2019re good people, too, man. We all know it. And we\u2019re all here for you, regardless of your past, even if you never talk about it.\u201d</p><p>I watched T.J.\u2019s shoulders relax just a bit, just beginning to realize that he\u2019d tensed up when I\u2019d started to pry. Wanting to lighten the mood again and, honestly, just wanting him to smile once more, I said lightly, \u201cAnd you\u2019re so damn pretty, too. It\u2019s no hardship to have you adding to the view.\u201d</p><p>I capped it off with a saucy wink that made Ian growl playfully before he reached out and pulled me into a hug, and we all ended up laughing, effectively breaking the tension.</p><p>Ian released me and I grabbed the broom to sweep up the mess on the floor, but didn\u2019t get far with it because T.J. deftly moved in and took it from me. I shot Ian a did-you-see-that? look, but he just waved me away.</p><p>T.J. had the floor swept clean, the chair pushed back into the table, my case packed up (neatly, I might add), and the broom put away in the blink of an eye, leaving me gaping at him again.</p><p>\u201cDamn, you\u2019re quick,\u201d I quipped as he leaned back against the counter, crossing his arms like he hadn\u2019t moved.</p><p>\u201cOnly when I need to be,\u201d he drawled, his lips twitching up in a sexy little smile as he winked exaggeratedly, being deliberately suggestive.</p><p>I flushed, unable to help it. \u201cI...uh...okay. You guys want a beer?\u201d I asked, stammering a little, making both Ian and T.J. laugh at me. Without waiting for an answer, I went to the fridge and grabbed two out, twisting the caps off automatically and handing one to each. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou flustered her,\u201d Ian chuckled, nudging T.J. with his shoulder as they stood side by side, leaning against the counter like they didn\u2019t have a care in the world.</p><p>\u201cIt happens.\u201d T.J. shrugged and gave me that maddening half-smile again.</p><p>\u201cGrrrr...\u201d I growled at him, glaring. \u201cI can\u2019t get you to hardly string sixteen words together before tonight, you barely ever smile, and now you\u2019re sexy smiling and winking at me? What the hell?\u201d I threw my hands up in frustration, ending with my legs apart and my hands on my hips as they both just smirked at me.</p><p>I gave up and crossed my arms, content just to glare at them when T.J. send a sideways glance at Ian and said, \u201cShe\u2019s a feisty one, isn\u2019t she,\u201d and Ian just nodded slowly, his eyes warming with glee. \u201cYes, she is, T.J. Yes, she is.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAssholes,\u201d I muttered, stalking out of the kitchen and throwing myself onto the couch, smiling to myself when I heard them laughing behind me. I wasn\u2019t really mad. How could I be? T.J. laughed and smiled...and opened himself just the tiniest bit.</p><p>There\u2019s a story there. And Chloe and I would figure it out eventually.</p><p>The guys made their way into the living room, T.J. perching on the edge of the recliner, his half-empty bottle of beer dangling from his fingertips between his wide-spread knees, and Ian picked my legs up and sat down, arranging my thighs across his lap, one of his hands curling possessively around my upper thigh while he traced his other one slowly up and down my shin.</p><p>I glanced at the clock, noting that it was only eight o\u2019clock.</p><p>Ian pinched my thigh lightly as he broke the silence, asking, \u201cYou over your fit?\u201d</p> <p>I ignored him, instead addressing the room in general. \u201cWanna watch a movie?\u201d I hit the button on the remote to go to the pay-per-view new releases and scrolled through to the comedy listings, popping them up on the screen.</p><p>Nothing caught my eye, so I dropped the remote and snuck a look at the Ian and then T.J., noting that they were both still smirking at me.</p><p>\u201cAre we going to watch something or not?\u201d I asked them, more to make them stop staring at me then anything.</p><p>T.J. chuckled and shrugged, then drained the rest of his beer.</p><p>\u201cWant another?\u201d I asked him, looking to see if Ian needed one, too.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNah, gotta drive home after the movie.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWant something else?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head again, so I looked at Ian and got a negative shake of his head, as well. I reached for the remote again, but Ian snagged it and turned it immediately onto one of the new shoot-\u2018em-up/bang-\u2018em-down movies that had just come out. Not my favorite but...whatever.</p><p>So it was totally not my fault that I was asleep within the first half hour.</p><p>Chapter 12</p><p>I was pacing back and forth across my sister\u2019s living room floor, agitation written across every inch of my body. I was so pissed that I couldn\u2019t even enjoy the cuteness of my niece as she watched me pace, her little head tracking me as I moved past her where she sat in her octagon-shaped, gated play yard, tossing her toys around and teasing the dogs that were watching her through the fence.</p><p>They\u2019d finally given up on following me, which was a good thing because every time I turned around to pace back the way I\u2019d come, I\u2019d almost trip over one of them as they scrabbled to get out of my way.</p><p>Emma was sitting on the arm of her couch, watching me with concern, her fingers fidgeting with the hem of her shirt. She\u2019d given up trying to get me to sit down and try to get calm once we\u2019d gotten back to her house.</p><p>Ian had called Luke, who\u2019d sent Emma to get me and take me to their house until things were dealt with at home and he could get to me, because he didn\u2019t want me driving while I was so upset.</p> <p>It was Wednesday, three days after a pretty kickass weekend that had ended with me asleep on the couch while my man watched a movie with T.J. When it was over, Ian had woken me to say goodbye to T.J., who\u2019d swooped me up in a tight hug, thanking me for cutting his hair and letting him hang. Then Ian had taken me to bed and...well, he\u2019d just plain taken me, sending me off to sleep with not one, not two, but three toe-curling, hair-pulling, eyes-rolling-back-in-the-head, screaming orgasms. He\u2019s good like that.</p><p>And Monday and Tuesday were perfectly fine, normal days. Today had been, too. Until about an hour ago when I walked into my bedroom to see a stack of Louis Vuitton luggage sitting in front of the dresser, the top one open and full of Ian\u2019s shirts, folded neatly. More than that, there was a very strong chlorine-y smell filling the room, making my eyes water.</p><p>Confused, and more than a little disturbed, I\u2019d retrieved my phone from my purse on the kitchen counter and called Ian.</p><p>\u201cUm, are you going somewhere, or you planning on leaving me?\u201d I\u2019d asked him, half-jokingly. \u201cAnd did you use bleach or something in the bathroom today?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d sounded distracted when he answered, \u201cWhat? What the fuck are you talking about? I\u2019m not going anywhere and I\u2019m sure as hell not leaving you. Why in the hell would you ask me something like that? And no, I didn\u2019t use...\u201d</p><p>His words cut off and he\u2019d me to hold on because he was getting a lot of texts coming through and the phone was beeping non-stop in his ear. Suddenly, I\u2019d heard him growl, his voice low and menacing as he\u2019d asked, \u201cAre you at home?\u201d</p><p>I opened my mouth to reply but stopped when a slip of paper on Ian\u2019s pillow caught my eye. Picking it up, I\u2019d read the first line, my fingers tightening on it as the words penetrated, leaving me unable to utter anything to Ian other than, \u201cGet. Home. Now,\u201d through tightly clenched teeth.</p><p>I\u2019d hung up on him, finished reading the note, and then stalked to my dresser to confirm what had been written. I was still standing there, ignoring my phone as Ian called me back over and over again, staring down into the drawers I\u2019d wrenched open, the note still crumpled in my fist when my sister had walked in, Everly on her hip.</p><p>As soon as I\u2019d seen her, I\u2019d whirled and pushed her gently out of the room, crying, \u201cNO! You can\u2019t have Everly in here, it\u2019s too strong!\u201d I\u2019d moved her into the kitchen before I\u2019d asked, \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d explained that Ian had called Luke to send her over to pick me up, but hadn\u2019t really told her why. Just that she needed to take me to their house and wait for Ian. I hadn\u2019t explained anything to her then, either. I\u2019d just opened my hand and dropped the crumpled note onto the counter. She\u2019d smoothed it out as best she could while still holding my niece, then gasped as she read.</p><p>Then she\u2019d folded it haphazardly, shoved it in her pocket, and after grabbing my keys off the counter, she\u2019d shoved my purse into my hands and marched me out the door and into her car.</p><p>Which brought us back to here, me pacing the floor of Emma\u2019s living room incessantly.</p><p>I\u2019d just turned on my heel to start back across the room when a car door slammed outside, sending the dogs into a barking fit. I glanced out to see Ian running flat out for the house and met him at the door as soon as it opened.</p><p>He grabbed me by the shoulders, leaning down to stare into my eyes as he asked, urgently, \u201cAre you okay? Why wouldn\u2019t you answer me? What happened after you hung up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you go home before coming here?\u201d I asked, flatly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo, I came straight to you because you were so upset, and I couldn\u2019t imagine that it could be worse than it already was. But you\u2019re still not going home until I get whatever it is cleaned up. What happened there? You never answered my questions.\u201d</p><p>I looked up at him, my face screwed up in confusion. \u201cWhat? You couldn\u2019t imagine it could be worse? I\u2019m confused, Ian. Did you go home and check it out or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I-\u201d he started, but I cut him off.</p><p>\u201cThen you have no idea what that...that...fucking cunt...did. So how could you say that it couldn\u2019t be worse than it was?\u201d I stared at him for a second longer, rage still burning me up. But then it clicked in my head. \u201cWhat else?\u201d</p> <p>Ian\u2019s fingers tightened on my shoulders and he tried to pull me into his embrace. \u201cBaby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Don\u2019t you \u2018baby\u2019 me, Ian. Tell me. What else? What else did she do, because it\u2019s obvious there was more, and it wasn\u2019t at the house.\u201d I was practically growling at him, and I knew it was getting to him because I saw him swallow hard, but I was beyond caring, though it wasn\u2019t him I was pissed off at.</p><p>It was Victoria, the fucking she-bitch from hell that was due to get her face rearranged just as soon as I got my hands on her.</p><p>Ian looked over my shoulder at Emma. \u201cYou might want to take Everly out of the room for a minute. I\u2019m so sorry, I know this is your house...or we could go outside. I just know this isn\u2019t going to be pretty.\u201d</p><p>Emma stood immediately and walked over to pluck Everly up from the play yard before she walked toward the stairs. \u201cIt\u2019s fine, she probably needs changed again, anyway.\u201d She suddenly jolted, like she\u2019d remembered something, which she had. She reached into her back pocket and pulled out the folded, crumpled up note that I\u2019d shown her at my house. \u201cYou\u2019ll need this,\u201d she said, stopping to hand it to Ian.</p> <p>Just...\u201d she bobbed her head around, her mouth opening and closing like she had something else to say, but just couldn\u2019t get it out.</p><p>Ian nodded and said, quietly, \u201cI know. I will. She\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>Emma sent him one last look that faded into relief at his words and ascended the stairs.</p><p>Ian didn\u2019t speak until they heard the door close upstairs. \u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>I took his phone from his hand when he held it out. It was an automatic movement, one I regretted just as soon as he said, \u201cText messages.\u201d</p><p>My stomach dropped and I felt sick, my mind making up a million and one scenarios as to what I\u2019d find when I clicked open his messages. But none of them could even come close to what I saw.</p> <p>Picture after picture of Victoria, naked, sprawled across my bed. Our bed. The bed Ian and I slept together in every night, the one we cuddled, played around, and made love in every night. Each image was different, and each was more graphic than the last. They started with her just laying in the middle of the bed, arms outstretched.</p><p>Then they moved to her spreading her legs, holding her breasts. And from there, it got worse. On all fours, spread wide so every inch of her pussy and ass was on display for the camera, while she bit my pillow. MY pillow!</p><p>On the edge of the bed, legs still splayed, fingers shoved inside herself as she (I\u2019m assuming) masturbated.</p><p>But the last one...the last one made one thought crystallize in my mind, ice-cold, and sharper than a blade...and that thought was, \u2018I\u2019m going to fucking murder that bitch.\u2019</p><p>Because it was a picture of Victoria, once more spread eagled on the bed, but this time her head was thrown back in what looked like the throes of an orgasm with her hand buried between her thighs, fingertips pressed against the apex of her cleft...and she was wearing my new fingertip massager toy. The picture was with a text that read, \u2018OMG, this thing was amazing. Bring it with you when you leave the tramp. It\u2019ll make it interesting when we fuck again.\u2019</p><p>My skin was prickling with heat, my stomach was roiling, and my eyes were boiling over with scalding hot tears of rage. My arm cocked back automatically, but Ian wrenched his phone out of my hand before I could let it fly. As soon as it was free from my grasp, my hands clenched so hard I could feel my nails biting into my flesh, and my mouth opened on a scream so terrifyingly long, loud, and so full of angry pain that it would have put a hellcat to shame.</p><p>Then I was moving, shoving past Ian towards the door. I felt him reach out to catch me, but I sidestepped and flung the door open, shoving open the screen door and rushing blindly through it, my scream still echoing off my lips.</p><p>I didn\u2019t get very far, though, as I slammed into a solid wall of unyielding man-chest. The owner of that man-chest\u2019s arms wrapped around me and held tight as I fought to get free, my only thought just to get away, find Victoria, and rip her apart from limb to limb.</p> <p>But I couldn\u2019t move as those arms banded around me, and I went limp when Luke\u2019s voice boomed above my head, hard and sharp enough to get my attention. \u201cLEAH!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry!\u201d The words were wrenched from my lips on a sob, and the damn broke completely, leaving me bawling into my brother-in-law\u2019s chest as he just held me and rocked gently from side to side.</p><p>I registered movement at my side, but couldn\u2019t stop crying enough to know what was happening until I was being swung up through the air into Ian\u2019s arms. I clutched at him, burying my face in his neck as emotion poured itself out of me in the form of a gut-wrenching sob-fest that left me drained, my breath coming in on hiccupping little gasps.</p><p>Through it all, Ian just held me, settling on the couch, whispering soothingly in my ear as he rubbed my back and rocked me.</p><p>Finally, I lifted my face to see Ian\u2019s right above mine, looking every bit as ravaged as I imagined mine did. I looked away, ashamed of how I\u2019d acted, feeling even lower when I realized that Luke was sitting beside us, watching me with concern etched across his face, and my sister was standing at the top of the stairs, looking down at me with tears streaming unchecked down her face.</p><p>\u201cOh, God...\u201d I whispered, turning back to look at Ian. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh...it\u2019s okay. I\u2019m the one who should be sorry that this is happening.\u201d He shook his head sadly, his handsome features pinched with worry and pain.</p><p>I felt a tentative touch on my ankle and looked up as Luke asked, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>Emma rushed down the stairs, reaching for the crumpled up piece of paper that had fluttered to the floor, forgotten in the craziness of the moment. She met my eyes and I could see the question in hers. I nodded my assent, knowing exactly what she was asking and, frankly, relieved that I didn\u2019t have to say it.</p><p>\u201cThe note explains it. Most of it, anyway. I\u2019m not...not really sure what was on Ian\u2019s phone and I don\u2019t know that I ever want to know. But, when I went to pick her up, she was standing there looking down into her dresser.\u201d She winced as she went on. \u201cThe room smelled straight up like bleach. Lots of it. And that\u2019s because Victoria opened every single one of Leah\u2019s drawers in her dresser and poured bleach over everything. I didn\u2019t see the damage, but I had Everly and Leah made sure we weren\u2019t around it.\u201d</p><p>Ian\u2019s arms tightened around me almost painfully.</p><p>Emma reached out with the note and handed it to Luke. \u201cRead it. Out loud. Ian hasn\u2019t gotten to see it yet. Oh, and there was a stack of luggage on the floor that looked like it had all your stuff packed into it, Ian. So...I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s something she did? Or...\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ian gave a short bark of laughter that had no amusement in it, whatsoever. \u201cNo. I definitely didn\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>Luke cleared his throat. \u201cDo you want me to read it?\u201d he asked Ian.</p><p>Ian gave a sharp, quick nod, his arms tightening even more in preparation, definitely moving into the borderline painful zone, but I didn\u2019t protest. I buried my face back into his neck, knowing that, if the pictures set me off on top of what had happened at home, Ian was about to go postal.</p><p>Luke opened the note carefully and muttered, \u201cOh, mother fucker,\u201d before he started to read.</p> <p>\u2018I\u2019m getting impatient, so I went ahead and packed for you, lover. I know I gave you time, but I\u2019m sick of waiting. Anyway, your bed is super comfy and I know you\u2019ll just love the pictures I took for you. Next time, though, I want you with me so we can take even naughtier ones. Oh, and I made sure to come extra hard all over your sheets. I know you\u2019ll want to smell me all wrapped around you while that tramp pants all over you, smelling like desperation and cheapness. I did her a favor and disinfected her discount lingerie. Don\u2019t worry, though. I left her church mouse teacher clothes alone. Wouldn\u2019t want to give her any reason to spend my our money. Call me later, okay? I love you!\u2019</p><p>Chapter 13</p><p>We stood at the door of the Jones\u2019 residence, Ian\u2019s finger pressing insistently on the doorbell. After what happened this evening, Ian was done. We\u2019d agreed between us to not press charges for the moment; at least not until we talked to Victoria or her parents, which is why it was after eight in the evening and we were standing on their front stoop, waiting for someone to answer the door.</p><p>An old man finally answered the door, his face screwed up like he smelled something bad when he looked out at us.</p><p>\u201cIs there something I may help you with?\u201d he said with a sneer.</p> <p>\u201cYes, Sweeny, there is. You can quit pretending you don\u2019t know who I am and get Victor and CeeCee. I need to discuss something very important with them,\u201d Ian said gruffly.</p><p>Sweeny huffed and motioned for us to follow him. We stepped into the foyer, one eerily similar to Ian\u2019s parents\u2019 house, and waited off to the side as the butler (I didn\u2019t know people actually had those anymore) shuffled off.</p><p>Fifteen minutes later, the impeccably dressed couple swept into the foyer, calling greetings out to Ian in overly loud, saccharine sweet voices. But it didn\u2019t take long for Ian to change that.</p><p>\u201cYou need to call off your daughter. I don\u2019t want to press charges, though I will if she doesn\u2019t stop interfering in our lives. She\u2019s delusional, and it stops now. Are we clear?\u201d</p><p>Victor Jones drew himself up, puffing out his chest. \u201cYou\u2019d do well to remember who you\u2019re talking to, Ian Thomas. I will be having words with your parents to let them know the outrageous things you\u2019re coming in to my home and saying. I have lost all respect for you. Do you hear me?\u201d</p><p>Victoria\u2019s mom had her hand to her chest, repeating, \u201cWell, I never!\u201d over and over again.</p> <p>Ian smirked. \u201cI think you\u2019d better hear me out before you go making threats to me. You can tell my parents anything you want because I plan on talking to them next. I\u2019ve already pretty much written them out of my life, and you hold no special place in my heart, so don\u2019t fool yourself into thinking I care one fucking bit what you think of me or how much you respect me.\u201d</p><p>He stepped forward, his voice lowering as he went on. \u201cYour daughter has a knack for showing up uninvited to places I\u2019m at, calling herself my girlfriend, acting like we\u2019re lovers...when that\u2019s never been the case. I\u2019ve found her naked in my bed before I moved in with Leah, and a few weeks ago, I caught her lounging naked in my office.\u201d His jaw was clenched when he continued.</p><p>\u201cBut today your daughter decided to break into our house and destroy personal property, not to mention the lewd acts she documented herself doing on our bed. I have all the evidence I need to ensure that a protection order is granted, and that she possibly serves jail time.\u201d</p><p>CeeCee gasped in outrage. \u201cYou are lying, you spoiled little...little...ugh!\u201d</p><p>Ian just quirked an eyebrow at her. \u201cSpoiled little what, CeeCee? I assure you that I am the most grounded person you have ever known. Tell Victoria that the game is done. Tell her that, if she contacts me or Leah or anyone else close to us ever again, I won\u2019t hesitate to take what I have to the police, and to ensure that the Prosecutor\u2019s Office has a hey-day with the pictures I have. Got it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re bluffing,\u201d Victor said coldly. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re trying to prove-\u201d</p><p>Ian spoke over him, asking, just as coldly, \u201cAm I bluffing, Victor?\u201d</p><p>Ian swiped across his phone to wake up the screen, tapped the text message icon, and immediately, the final, most graphic photo Victoria had taken popped up on the screen. Ian held it up, not giving two shits that he was showing Victor a picture of the man\u2019s daughter literally twaddling herself on our bed.</p> <p>The man blanched, his skin going pasty white as his hand came up to clutch at his chest. CeeCee screamed and covered her eyes, stumbling back from Ian\u2019s hand like it was a snake about to strike.</p><p>I reached out and gently pressed Ian\u2019s arm down, effectively removing the offending image from everyone\u2019s view. I hated the bitch, but no one needed to see that much of Victoria for that long.</p><p>On a sigh, Ian shoved his phone back into his pocket, and we he spoke again, his tone was almost gentle. \u201cVictor, I hate that it\u2019s come to this, but I can\u2019t stand by and make excuses anymore. I\u2019ve always said that Victoria\u2019s harmless, that she just had a crush on me that she\u2019d grow out of. I never encouraged her, no matter how much you and my parents have wanted us to end up together, but she\u2019s still wreaked havoc on my life for years now. She\u2019s conspiring with my mother for me to propose to her, which is never going to happen, and something I will be addressing with my mother as soon as I can.\u201d</p><p>He pulled me into his side, his arm sliding around my shoulders. \u201cLeah is the only woman for me. She\u2019s the one I\u2019m going to marry, the one I\u2019m going to spend the rest of my life trying to make as happy as she makes me. She\u2019s my world, and I won\u2019t let your daughter hurt her ever again, in any way.\u201d</p><p>My heart stuttered and melted when Ian uttered the \u2018M\u2019 word, and I had to bite my lips hard to keep from grinning, because it was totally not the time to be doing that.</p><p>Then suddenly, I didn\u2019t have to worry about grinning in front of them, because I was fighting to keep my claws sheathed as the front door opened and Victoria sailed through, like she didn\u2019t have a care in the world.</p><p>\u201cHi, Mommy, Hi, Daddy! What are you...Oh!\u201d Eyes huge, she skidded to a stop, panic washing across her face fleetingly before it was gone. In it\u2019s place was the carefree bimbo she usually presented.</p><p>\u201cIan! How nice to see you! Awww...and you brought Leah? Sweetie, we need to get together soon for drinks and to catch up.\u201d She rolled her eyes and flapped her hands as she squealed and said, \u201cOh, the stories I could tell you about our little Ian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, Victoria!\u201d Victor thundered loudly, his voice making us all jump in surprise.</p><p>Victoria flinched and raised wounded eyes to her father. \u201cDaddy, why are you acting like this?\u201d she whimpered. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Victor raised his hand and swung, catching Victoria in a ringing slap across her cheek. He raised his hand again, but didn\u2019t connect, because Ian stepped forward and grabbed his wrist, halting the movement.</p><p>\u201cStop, Victor. She may well deserve it, but I will not abide a man beating a woman, even if she is his child,\u201d Ian warned, releasing his arm and stepping back again.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Ian,\u201d Victoria simpered, batting her eyelashes, her hand cradling the reddened mark on her cheek.</p><p>Ian whirled on her in an instant. \u201cDon\u2019t you thank me, you devious little witch.\u201d</p> <p>She gasped and tears filled her eyes, but Ian kept going.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t doing it for you. They know what you\u2019ve done today, Victoria. They\u2019ve seen the proof,\u201d he paused, delivering the final words on a growl, \u201cin pictures.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...no, no, no, no, no...\u201d Victoria began chanting, shaking her head from side to side almost maniacally.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Ian hissed, nodding his head just as vigorously. \u201cThat\u2019s it, Victoria. Stay the fuck away from me, stay the fuck away from Leah, stay the fuck away from my family, and that includes all my friends, Leah\u2019s friends, anyone that I love. And for the record? That list DOES NOT include you!\u201d</p><p>Ian glanced at Victor and CeeCee, lifting his chin as he asked, \u201cAre we clear in what we discussed?\u201d</p> <p>Victor jerked his chin upwards once in a sharp nod, but CeeCee just stood there beside him, hand still clamped around her mouth, her face sickened.</p><p>Ian nodded once back at him, took my hand, and we walked out of the door.</p><p>And...umm...I may have shoulder checked Victoria as I walked by. Hard enough to make her stumble.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d I called sweetly. \u201cGee, be careful where you step. It\u2019s so easy to stumble in heels that high...\u201d I said, shooting her my best butter-wouldn\u2019t-melt-in-my-mouth smile as I closed the door behind me.</p><p>Once we were safely ensconced in the car and on the road, Ian sent me a sideways glance, the corner of his mouth tipped up in a wryly amused half-smile.</p><p>\u201cWas that necessary?\u201d he asked, dryly.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked in reply. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>I spent the rest of the ride staring out the window...but I couldn\u2019t help the sly ghost of a smile on my face.</p><p>We finally got home after taking a quick side trip to Ian\u2019s parents\u2019 house, but I stayed in the car for that one. It didn\u2019t take long, anyway, as they met him at the door. I saw a lot of head shaking on Ian\u2019s Mom\u2019s part, while his Dad just looked sick to his stomach. Thankfully, Ian didn\u2019t have to pull out his phone to drive his point home, but I think it had more to do with the fact that Victor had called them before we pulled up, hence the reason they met Ian at the door.</p><p>Brandon\u2019s Expedition was sitting in our driveway as we pulled past it and parked in the garage, and Chloe and Brandon were sitting at the kitchen table when we walked in, eating pizza directly from an opened delivery box on the table between them.</p><p>\u201cPizza?\u201d Brandon asked, taking another big bite of the slice he was holding.</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d I cried, practically running for the table to grab up a slice, biting into the piping hot, mouth-watering blend of pizza sauce, pepperoni, and cheese. \u201cGod, I\u2019m starving,\u201d I mumbled, my voice muffled by a mouthful of food...and very bad manners, but I couldn\u2019t bring myself to care at the moment. Any dinner plans we may have had were completely ruined by Victoria, and we hadn\u2019t stopped to eat in between delivering our cease and desist messages.</p><p>Ian wasn\u2019t far behind me, grabbing his own slice and I swear he inhaled it without chewing.</p><p>I swallowed the last bite and moaned, grabbing a paper towel and wiping my fingers. \u201cThank you for sharing with us,\u201d I told Chloe and Brandon, smiling at them gratefully. \u201cAnd thank you, seriously, for coming over here and cleaning up the mess while we were gone. You didn\u2019t have to do that; I could have handled it when we got back.\u201d</p> <p>Chloe shook her head. \u201cStop. I don\u2019t want to hear that. As soon as Brandon told me something was going on, did you really think I\u2019d just let you deal with it on your own? No. You\u2019re my best friend.\u201d</p><p>Brandon and Chloe had shown up at Luke and Emma\u2019s house as we were about to leave. Luke had mentioned what happened to Brandon before he left to go home, so naturally, Brandon had told Chloe, and they\u2019d told us in no uncertain terms that they\u2019d be going to our house to clean up the mess so we wouldn\u2019t have to deal with it.</p><p>And they\u2019d gone the extra mile and provided much needed sustenance for us...so needless to say, I have the best friends. Ever.</p><p>Ian and I sat down at the table to eat pizza with Chloe and Brandon. I\u2019d barely gotten seated when Chloe started questioning us about what had happened. We filled them in, starting with the note that they hadn\u2019t gotten to read.</p><p>When I was finished reading, Chloe looked ready to commit murder on my behalf.</p><p>\u201cCalm down, killer,\u201d I soothed, jokingly. \u201cRemember? I get dibs on doling out bodily harm, and I need you to be on hand to bail me out.\u201d</p><p>She laughed and we grinned at each other; the guys just shook their heads, but still, Ian warned, \u201cThere will be no bodily harm done to anyone that will cause either one of you to end up needing bail money. Yes?\u201d</p><p>Like we\u2019d rehearsed it (which we hadn\u2019t, obviously-great mind just think alike!), Chloe and I both saluted Ian smartly, yelling, \u201cSir, yes sir!\u201d But then we couldn\u2019t contain our giggles when Ian just rolled his eyes and muttered, \u201cSmart asses,\u201d at the same time Brandon did.</p><p>We were brought back down when Ian suddenly asked, \u201cWe never really looked to see or anything before we left, but how the fuck did she get in? Did you see anything?\u201d</p><p>Brandon grimaced. \u201cYeah, she broke the glass out of the window in the spare bedroom and crawled through, using a chair from the back porch to stand on. Bold, but, since the window faces the back, she had no worries about anyone seeing her. And since the gate on your privacy fence doesn\u2019t have a lock...\u201d</p><p>He trailed off, shrugging regretfully, but he didn\u2019t have to finish what he was saying. I knew. I hadn\u2019t put a lock on the gate because, honestly, it was a good neighborhood in the country, my sister never had any problems when she lived there, and I hadn\u2019t either, until now. But I also wasn\u2019t counting on my boyfriend having a stalker. Though, maybe I should have...he is pretty damn sexy. (Wink wink!)</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I sighed. \u201cI guess I\u2019ll be going out tomorrow after work and getting lock for it. I wish I would have known about the window...it\u2019s just gonna be open all night because it\u2019s too late to get something to board it up or whatever. I\u2019ll have to call and get a new one priced, too.\u201d</p><p>Ian cleared his throat. \u201cDid you forget what I do, baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Yeah.\u201d I smiled sheepishly at him. \u201cWasn\u2019t thinking. You can do the window then, but what are we gonna do tonight? We don\u2019t have any plywood or anything...I don\u2019t think...\u201d I wracked my brain, inventorying the contents of my garage mentally, but coming up empty.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s taken care of,\u201d Brandon interrupted. \u201cJackson had some extra plywood pieces in his garage. I swung by and grabbed one, and Luke and I boarded up the window earlier.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I jumped up and swung around the table, practically throwing myself at Brandon. He scooted his chair back quickly as I was bearing down on him, opening his arms at the last second and catching me to his chest, settling me across his lap as he wrapped me up in a big bear hug. I squeezed him tight for a moment before pulling back and looking him in the eye as I said, \u201cThank you, Brandon. For everything.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled and gave me another squeeze as he replied, \u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>I kissed his cheek before I moved off his lap and walked back toward my chair, but veered at the last second, plopping myself down in Chloe\u2019s lap next, wrapping my arms around her neck and kissing her cheek over and over again until she was squealing, laughing, and trying to push me off.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, you\u2019re welcome! God, Ian, get your crazy-ass woman off me!\u201d she yelled, still laughing.</p><p>I kissed her cheek one last time and grinned at her. \u201cYou guys rock, you know that?\u201d I asked.</p><p>She pretended to breathe on her knuckles and polished them on her shoulder, pursing her lips and nodding her head in that yep-I\u2019m-awesome-and-badass way. \u201cI know,\u201d she said, cockily.</p><p>Brandon groaned. \u201cOh, Christ. You\u2019re gonna give her an even bigger head,\u201d he grumbled, but the twinkle in his eyes told us he was kidding.</p><p>But Chloe took the cake with her comeback. \u201cNo, she\u2019s not, but you will later...\u201d she said, winking saucily at him.</p><p>When we were done eating and joking around, I motioned for Chloe to follow me, moving down the hall to my bedroom as Ian and Brandon tossed paper plates and pizza boxes into the trash, cleaning up after dinner. \u201cAlright. So tell me, how bad was the damage? I know most of my bras and underwear are ruined.\u201d</p><p>And that made me want to cry.</p><p>I opened the bedroom door, gritting my teeth in a flash of anger as the unmistakable scent of bleach teased my nostrils.</p><p>Chloe grimaced. \u201cI opened the windows and aired out the room, but...she used two whole gallons of straight bleach. I found the containers in the bathtub. Why they were in the tub? No clue...but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo gallons?\u201d I whispered, cringing at the thought. \u201cJesus, did it melt them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Chloe hedged. \u201cLet\u2019s just say that you\u2019re gonna need a new dresser and all new underclothes. And your shorts and tanks in the bottom drawers?\u201d</p><p>She gave me a pained look, with jaw clenched, teeth showing, eyes squinting, and nose crinkled. She didn\u2019t have to say another word.</p><p>I closed my eyes and breathed out, trying not to cry. As a teacher, I didn\u2019t have a huge income. I had a decent savings account balance, but replacing my dresser and a good chunk of my wardrobe was going to hurt.</p><p>\u201cI cleaned it all out and put it in a trash bag. Your underwear was pretty holey, like it had just eaten through most of them. Bras, too. None of it was worth saving. I\u2019m so sorry...\u201d she ended on a whisper.</p><p>I sighed, blinking rapidly to keep from crying. And it wasn\u2019t that I was crying for my belongings; I mean, that sucked big, huge donkey balls, but things can be replaced. I was fighting tears of anger, because she came into my home, my sanctuary, and violated it. Plus, she was after my boyfriend, and that\u2019s not okay.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t apologize, Chloe.\u201d I sucked in a breath and blew it back out, realizing that I had spoken sharply. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I told her, stepping over and giving her a hug.</p><p>She smacked my shoulder lightly. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare apologize to me, either, Leah! It\u2019s been a long, trying day. I put away Ian\u2019s clothes for him...so he\u2019s a boxer brief man, huh?\u201d she asked, her eyes twinkling with mirth.</p><p>I winked at her, no longer in danger of bursting into tears. \u201cWhen he remembers to wear them,\u201d I said, slyly.</p><p>She lifted a shoulder and widened her eyes comically as she cooed, \u201cOooh...sexy commando,\u201d before she busted out laughing once more. She sobered quickly, though, as she remembered something. \u201cOh, yeah. I meant to ask you about Ian\u2019s luggage. I didn\u2019t know where to put it, so...\u201d</p><p>My eyes narrowed. \u201cThat\u2019s not his luggage. He\u2019s not a label whore. That\u2019s Victoria\u2019s.\u201d Her name came out on a hiss.</p> <p>Chloe dusted her hands together and nodded, obviously coming to a decision in her mind. And as soon as she looked at me, I knew exactly what she was thinking. \u201cThen there\u2019s only one thing to do with it, right?\u201d she asked, lightly.</p><p>Our eyes met, both of our mouths curled up in very evil grins, and we said, together, \u201cBonfire!\u201d</p><p>Chapter 14</p><p>\u201cMmmm...\u201d I moaned against Ian\u2019s neck, languidly tracing my tongue along his skin, nipping here and there, my breath coming in slow pants against his throat.</p><p>My fingers dug into the back of the couch, my knees braced on the cushions alongside Ian\u2019s muscular thighs, and I kept up my slow pace, gently raising and lowering myself on his cock, reveling in the feel of the thick, heated length of him stretching and sliding against my slick, tender folds.</p><p>I was riding him slowly, deliberately, taking my time, rocking against him with every move, the tips of my breasts brushing against his chest, enhancing the pleasure curling through my body, streaming over every inch of my skin.</p><p>\u201cBaby,\u201d he groaned, his fingers digging into my hips, urging me to move faster, but I resisted. \u201cHarder...\u201d he breathed.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I gasped, my head dropping back, arching my back and swirling my hips before grinding down on him, still rotating my hips smoothly, but not increasing my pace.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Leah!\u201d he gritted out between clenched teeth. \u201cFaster!\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, denying him once more. I knew he was ready to explode, could feel his thighs trembling underneath me with the effort to hold back his urge to pound furiously inside of me, knew I was pushing him.</p><p>But that\u2019s what I wanted. I wanted the wildness that would come when he couldn\u2019t fight it anymore, when he couldn\u2019t take the pace I had set.</p><p>\u201cLeah,\u201d he growled again and I buried my face back into his neck to hide my smile.</p><p>I used my thighs to raise myself again, this time letting him slip completely out of me, then glided my wetness over him, sliding against him back and forth, the thick ridge of the head of his cock bumping over my clit again and again until I was moaning uncontrollably and my body was aching to have him fill me once more.</p><p>Ian\u2019s muscles bunched underneath me and I felt his hand slide up my body until he cupped my jaw, his thumb brushing my lips and then shoving inside roughly. I sucked hard on it, loving the rough snarl that emitted from his lips. He jerked it free and grabbed my hips, gripping them tightly.</p><p>I felt myself being lifted as Ian flexed his hips, sliding himself against me one more time until the tip of him notched into my entrance and he slammed home, pulling me down to meet his almost violent upward thrust.</p><p>\u201cFuck!\u201d he yelled as he powered up into me, his hand sliding up my back until his hands curved over my shoulders, giving him leverage to hold me in place as he fucked up into me with wild abandon, finally at the breaking point.</p><p>I gave myself over to it, the gentle but overwhelming release that had been building slowly bearing down on me like a runaway freight train, no longer coasting into pleasure, but instead, crashing into me and sending me screaming over the edge, Ian right there with me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He roared his release, his whole body bucking and juddering beneath me, his cock swelling and jerking as he buried it deep inside me. My sex clenched around him, milking him as I ground my hips down, wringing every last drop of pleasure from him until I collapsed against his chest, both of us breathing like we\u2019d just run a marathon.</p><p>Finally, after a long moment, I roused myself enough to unclench my fingers from the back of the couch, groaning as I straightened them.</p><p>\u201cOw...\u201d I grumbled, then glared up at Ian as he chuckled, his chest rumbling beneath my cheek.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your fault,\u201d he said, smirking down at me.</p><p>I didn\u2019t reply, choosing instead to bask in the afterglow of my orgasm. I cuddled closer to him and he wrapped his arms around me tighter, his cheek resting on the top of my head.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he said, softly.</p><p>I closed my eyes. \u201cI love you, more,\u201d I whispered back before I sighed and shifted, lifting up off of him. I shivered as I felt him slip out of me and smiled at his soft groan, leaning down to kiss him once more before going to clean up.</p><p>It\u2019d been a month and a half since the last incident with Icktoria (Chloe came up with the new name) and, hopefully, she\u2019d gotten the message, because we hadn\u2019t heard anything from her. Does that mean that I breathe easy thinking that it would never happen again? Hell, no!</p><p>We\u2019d gotten the window replaced and put a lock on the gate, plus we\u2019d had an updated alarm system installed. I\u2019d replaced my clothes and underwear that she\u2019d damaged, and yes, we had a bonfire with some hellaciously expensive luggage that would probably make some people weep and question our sanity.</p><p>In fact, most of the guys had been on fire and baby duty that night, being the gracious husbands/fianc\u00e9s/boyfriends they are, and we women had gotten gloriously wasted on Ice Wine, champagne, and sangria. Even Nanny had attended and had sipped a finger\u2019s worth of champagne (she\u2019s not supposed to be drinking), claiming that as the reason she took off her bra (underneath her shirt, thank God) and whirled it around her head as she danced around the fire.</p><p>What\u2019s worse? My mom and Allie\u2019s mom joined in.</p><p>So we couldn\u2019t be left out, right? And there may or may not be a video swimming around a phone somewhere that I just know is gonna end up on YouTube. My brother\u2019s a dick sometimes. A funny one, but one nonetheless, and he lives to torture us. Add in the chance to torture our Mom? It\u2019s inevitable. I just thank God that Calland was nice to me at my graduation party. He almost didn\u2019t live to see the end of Emma\u2019s...poor girl. But still, that video is going to come back to haunt us...</p><p>Ian walked into the bathroom while I was getting in the shower, breaking me free from my thoughts. I couldn\u2019t help the thrill that shot through me at the sight of his naked body, impressive in all ways, even when things were...let\u2019s just say sleeping.</p><p>\u201cYou okay? You were taking forever,\u201d he said, conversationally, as he opened up the shower door and pushed me back, stepping into the enclosure with me.</p><p>I quirked my eyebrow at him and reached for the shampoo.</p><p>He took it from me, squirted some in his palm, and then spun me around before sinking his fingers into my hair, gently massaging my head as he worked up a lather. I moaned and let my head fall back, giving myself over to his ministrations.</p><p>\u201cSo, do we have plans today?\u201d he continued speaking, rinsing my hair carefully under the spray and moving on to conditioner.</p><p>\u201cUmm...\u201d I mumbled, unable to think right then. \u201cI don\u2019t think so...\u201d</p><p>He rinsed my hair once more, and when he was done, I leaned back into him, feeling that not-so-sleepy-anymore part of him prodding my back. \u201cYou\u2019re poking me,\u201d I grumbled, playfully, still keeping my eyes closed and my head tipped back.</p><p>He muttered something under his breath that I didn\u2019t catch, but when I turned my head to look at him, he just gave me an innocent look and reached for my bodywash and loofah, sudsing it up to the max.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d you say?\u201d I asked him sweetly.</p><p>He shook his head and smiled to himself as he bent to his current task, which was cleaning my body thoroughly. And by thoroughly, I meant that ten seconds into it, he abandoned the loofah and just slid his soapy hands all over my skin, teasing, tickling, and cleaning at the same time. He paid special attention to my nipples, rolling and pinching them with his fingers and then palming my breasts and massaging them until I was moaning against him again.</p><p>I arched my hips back, rubbing myself against his cock, which made his hands clench on my breasts, squeezing them almost painfully.</p> <p>\u201cOh!\u201d I gasped, arching even more into his hands, then staggered when he spun me quickly until we were facing each other. He caught me against his chest and his hands slid down to grasp my hips, lifting and opening my legs so that I was held in his arms, my back against the shower wall, his hardened length nestled right where I wanted it most.</p><p>He pressed himself forward, the tip of him barely parting the moist folds at the apex of my thighs, then slid back and forth, bumping against my clit over and over again until I was panting and shuddering against him.</p><p>I squirmed, trying to slide him inside me when he glided back toward my entrance once more. \u201cIan!\u201d I groaned. \u201cPlease, now...\u201d I begged him.</p><p>With no further hesitation, Ian slammed himself high inside me, pressing me fully back against the wall. He dragged his cock out of me slowly and then thrust back in, quickly setting a pounding rhythm that had me screaming out with release in seconds, and he wasn\u2019t far behind.</p><p>When we were finished, he let me slide slowly down his body, both of us winded but more than satiated since we\u2019d essentially fucked the morning away.</p><p>But I wasn\u2019t complaining!</p><p>\u201cTrick or treat!\u201d my sister yelled, waving like a madwoman as she walked up the sidewalk in front of my house, pushing Everly in front of her in the stroller.</p><p>\u201cOh my God!\u201d I cried, clapping my hands together in delight. \u201cShe looks so cute!\u201d I moved out onto the sidewalk and unclipped her from the straps holding her in and hefted her into my arms.</p><p>Emma had dressed the baby up as a little ladybug, complete with a red and black polka-dotted tutu. Emma herself was dressed in an all pink sweatsuit, and a tennis shoe was strapped to her head.</p><p>I kissed Everly\u2019s cheek and asked her, \u201cAnd just what the heck is your Mommy tonight, huh?\u201d She giggled and smacked my cheek before pointing at her mom.</p><p>Emma raised her eyebrow and twirled. \u201cReally? You can\u2019t tell what I am?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, no,\u201d I answered, shaking my head. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have asked if I knew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m bubble gum on the bottom of a shoe!\u201d she crowed, grinning widely.</p><p>\u201cAaaaahhh...\u201d I said, nodding my head slowly. \u201cI see now. Where\u2019s the rest of the group?\u201d I asked her, looking down the driveway.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re coming. I just got a little ahead,\u201d she mumbled guiltily.</p><p>It was Trick or Treat night in Phillus and Emma, Allie, and Jenna had banded together to make the rounds with the kids, not only to make sure the family got to see the kids in their adorable costumes, but to maximize the amount of candy they\u2019d get to confiscate. Lucky for me, Jarrod and I have a deal worked out. He\u2019s not a fan of Kit Kat bars and I love them, so every year at Halloween, I trade him a small bag of Reese cups for his Kit Kats. It\u2019s a win-win situate that has served me well for the past couple of years, provided I get to his bag before Jenna does. She likes Kit Kats, too. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They\u2019d all already made the rounds to my parents\u2019 house, Allie\u2019s parents\u2019 house, Chloe\u2019s Mom\u2019s house, and had parked down the street to hit up the neighbors houses before they got to mine, since my house used to be Emma\u2019s. The neighbors had practically threatened her if she didn\u2019t bring Everly and the other babies by.</p><p>\u201cHey, Emma. And there\u2019s my little girl!\u201d Ian cooed, coming up behind me and taking Everly from me. He disappeared inside just as the others came up the driveway.</p><p>I looked over at my brother-in-law and busted out laughing. \u201cWhat the hell did she do to you?\u201d I asked him when I could talk.</p><p>He gave a long-suffering sigh and answered, \u201cA tornado.\u201d</p> <p>I cocked my head and studied him. \u201cWell, Emma. You outdid yourself this year, I think. Where the hell did you get so many miniature...things?\u201d I asked, waving my hand vaguely at Luke.</p><p>His costume was black sweat pants and black hoodie, and Emma had pinned or glued random miniature trees, houses, cars, farm animals...pretty much anything she could get her hands on...in a spiral around his body, starting with his left ankle and ending with his shoulders.</p><p>Emma grinned and said, \u201cThe craft store. I can come up with something for you next year, if you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah...maybe...\u201d I replied, then addressed my other sister, Jenna, in hopes that Emma would forget to include me in her new costume making venture. \u201cYou and Noah didn\u2019t dress up?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo. I swear with these three, I\u2019m lucky to put deodorant on in the mornings. Here. Take your nephew.\u201d</p> <p>I reached out and took Caleb from her. \u201cAww...don\u2019t you just make the cutest little elephant?\u201d I cuddled him close to my chest and called hello to Noah, Hayden (who was dressed as Elsa from Frozen), Jarrod (who was in ninja gear), and Jackson (surprisingly not in costume), before I greeted Allie.</p><p>\u201cYou let my sister get to you, didn\u2019t you.\u201d</p><p>She responded pretty much the same way Luke did, sighing heavily. \u201cYa think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, give. Why are you wrapped in tin foil?\u201d</p><p>She spread her arms out. \u201cI\u2019m leftovers. Can\u2019t you tell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure!\u201d I said brightly, pasting a fake smile on my face.</p> <p>Her arm darted out and smacked me on my hip, careful not to jostle the baby in my arms, or the one on her hip.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d I cried in mock affront, then laughed when Liam chortled. \u201cThat\u2019s funny, huh? You like when Mommy hits me?\u201d I asked him, using my free hand to tickle his furry little tummy. He was dressed in a little monkey costume, complete with stuffed banana. \u201cHow\u2019d Jackson get out of it?\u201d</p><p>Allie shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m still not so sure of that one myself.\u201d</p><p>We moved into the house, everyone milling around and eating the plates of snacks and things I\u2019d put out, knowing that they\u2019d all hang around for a while. We took turns passing candy out to the kids that came to the door, but by the time everyone had gotten there, Trick or Treat was almost over.</p><p>It was going on nine o\u2019clock when they all started leaving, and that was another whirlwind of goodbyes, hugs, and kisses. Jarrod had crowed when he\u2019d dug in to the bag of Reese cups (I\u2019d gotten him the bigger bag this year, much to my sister\u2019s dismay) but then had glared at his mom when she forbade him from eating any more tonight.</p><p>By ten, Ian and I were alone, snuggling on the couch and watching a movie. Halfway through it, Ian kissed the top of my head and said, \u201cCan you believe it\u2019s almost the holidays already?\u201d</p><p>I nuzzled his throat and murmured my response against his skin. \u201cI know. It\u2019s crazy. This year has gone by so fast.\u201d</p><p>I felt him nod against my head, and then grumbled when he shifted. \u201cMmm...don\u2019t move,\u201d I ordered him. \u201cI\u2019m comfortable.\u201d</p> <p>He chuckled softly, but then time stood still and everything fell away as his hand came up in front of my face and I caught sight of the diamond ring dangling from his fingertips.</p><p>I sat up in a rush, my hand flying up to cover my mouth even as I gasped, \u201cOh my God! Ohmigod, ohmigod, ohmigod...\u201d</p><p>His face was earnest, his free hand clasping my wrist to keep me close. \u201cLeah...I was going to wait until Christmas to do this, but I just can\u2019t wait anymore. I had a big thing planned, and I know you probably would want your family to see this, but...\u201d He paused, sliding off the couch to kneel in front of me, eliciting another round of \u2018ohmigod\u2019s\u2019 from me.</p><p>He took my hand in his once more, then continued. \u201cI\u2019ve learned a lot about love from you and from your family. I\u2019ve learned that sometimes love is quiet, and sometimes love is loud. Sometimes love is small, and sometimes it\u2019s so huge that it encompasses your every breath, your every move. That love...that\u2019s what I have with you. I couldn\u2019t imagine my life without you, and I never want to. So, Leah Nicole Jensen, will you do me the greatest honor and please be my wife? Will you marry me?\u201d</p><p>He looked up at me, his face so serious, but shining with so much love that I could never doubt in a million years the way he really feels about me. Tears spilled over and a sob broke from my lips as I reached for him, crushing my mouth to his in a fervent kiss, even as I whispered, \u201cYes, YES!\u201d against his lips.</p><p>He kissed me back briefly, but broke it to slide the ring on my finger. I looked at it, really taking it in. It was beautiful, a large, solitaire princess cut diamond rimmed with smaller diamonds, and a diamond encrusted, white gold band.</p><p>\u201cIan,\u201d I breathed, \u201cI love you, you know that?\u201d I asked him. It was totally a rhetorical question, and he knew it since he just smiled.</p><p>His hand came up and wiped away my tears, and he leaned in and took my lips in a sweet kiss. \u201cSo, that\u2019s a yes, right?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, baby, that\u2019s a HELL YES!\u201d I shouted at him, throwing myself into his arms.</p><p>Chapter 15</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ, for the love of everything holy on this fucking planet, stop ringing my fucking doorbell!\u201d an enraged Brandon yelled as he threw open the door. He was bare-chested, wearing a pair of basketball shorts that hung loosely around his hips, and scowling hard enough that, if I didn\u2019t know he adored me, I\u2019d think my time on earth was over.</p><p>I was standing on their doorstep, and in his defense, I\u2019d been ringing the doorbell non-stop for the last couple of minutes, even though I have a key, but I\u2019m not currently keen on using it again any time soon. That\u2019s another story. And maybe it didn\u2019t help that it was barely eight in the morning, but I was a woman on a mission. I had news that I needed to share with my best friend, who didn\u2019t answer her phone last night!</p><p>\u201cOh. L-Leah...Hey,\u201d Brandon stuttered, his eyes narrowing in confusion. \u201cSorry, I-uh, why did...are you...?\u201d He shook his head, completely at a loss for what to say, apparently, his hand moving up to rub the back of his head nervously.</p><p>I took pity on him. \u201cGood morning! Sorry, but I really needed to talk to Chloe and she didn\u2019t answer her phone last night.\u201d I gave him my brightest smile and batted my eyelashes at him, making him look at me even more weirdly, but then he turned to the side and motioned me in.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you use your key?\u201d he asked me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cUh, because I knew you guys would still probably be in bed and, given the voracity of your lust for each other, I didn\u2019t want a repeat visual like the other day,\u201d I told him, matter-of-factly.</p><p>\u201cAh. Gotcha,\u201d he said, nodding. \u201cYup. Totally understandable. Just-uh, yeah. Chloe\u2019s in the kitchen.\u201d He pointed the way unnecessarily, and I slid by him, shaking my head as he shut the door behind me and then disappeared down the hall.</p><p>See, a couple weeks ago, I\u2019d been meeting Chloe to pick her up to go out to dinner, but apparently, the love bug had bitten her and Brandon just at that moment and I\u2019d walked into the house to see them...well, how to put this delicately...humping like rabbits hopped up on speed on top of the ottoman in the living room. It\u2019s a little unsettling (if not a little humorous) to lock eyes with your best friend and her lover as he slammed home one last time and they both belted out very loud (and I\u2019m guessing very satisfying) orgasms.</p><p>Truth be told, I\u2019d shrieked and apologized profusely as I stood there, but just couldn\u2019t get my feet to move, completely frozen to the spot in embarrassed, abject horror. And, of course, staying true to my (total family trait, unfortunately) usual weird awkwardness, I\u2019d laughed nervously as we stared at each other and then had quipped, \u2018Well, I don\u2019t know about you, but I need a cigarette now. Good form, ol\u2019 chap, good form!\u2019 before I\u2019d turned on my heel (finally unfrozen) and walked back out the door. I\u2019d sat in the car until a fully dressed and absolutely fire-engine-red-faced Chloe had slunk into the passenger seat, not saying a word.</p> <p>So, yes, a little bit of awkwardness still hangs there when I see Brandon now, but I think it\u2019s more on his part, stemming from the fact that all of his sister-in-laws have seen him naked by this point. Again, in his defense, it was all by accident; trust me, my sisters and I have no desire to go around spying on him naked...although, yes, we all must say that he is definitely one fine specimen of totally hot maleness. And Chloe (and Allie) agrees.</p><p>I jumped into the kitchen, a ball of wired, blissfully happy energy, yelling, \u201cCHLOE!\u201d</p><p>She jerked, shrieked, and sloshed her cup of coffee down the front of her which earned me a nice death stare.</p><p>But that changed very quickly to concern as I danced in front of her, flapping and waving my hand frantically in front of me.</p><p>\u201cUm, Leah, are you okay? Do you have to pe-OH MY GOD!\u201d she screamed, cutting herself off mid-sentence as she finally noticed the large rock winking from my finger. \u201cIs that a ring? An ENGAGEMENT RING?!\u201d</p> <p>She reached out and grabbed my hand, pulling it toward her face almost violently so she could get a good look at it and then caught my eye. When I nodded \u2018yes\u2019 to her, she started jumping up and down, screeching and babbling and crying, holding my hand tightly between her boobs, which jerked me back and forth wildly until I gave in and started jumping with her.</p><p>We were laughing and crying and still yelling at each other with giddiness when Brandon poked his head around the corner, his lips and eyebrows curled up in a concerned, slightly scared, wholly you-two-are-insane look as he asked, \u201cWhat the hell is going on in here?\u201d</p><p>Chloe dropped my hand but pulled me close into a tight hug, swaying me back and forth as she squealed to Brandon, \u201cWe\u2019re getting married!\u201d</p><p>He blinked at her in surprise before saying, cautiously, \u201cI know, sunshine. We\u2019ve been planning the wedding, and Leah already said she\u2019d be your maid of honor.\u201d He then glanced at me, silently asking me to translate the situation for him, but before I could say anything, Chloe shoved me backwards, but kept my hand.</p><p>\u201cNo, you idiot!\u201d she cried, stomping over to him and dragging me along with her. \u201cIan proposed! Leah\u2019s getting married, too! We\u2019re getting married!\u201d By the time she was done with her explanation, she was grinning and bouncing once more, which made me bounce again by default.</p><p>Brandon moved into the doorway and leaned against it, grinning as he looked at my ring, then winked at me as he replied, \u201cOh. Yeah, I know. Congrats!\u201d</p> <p>I pulled away from Chloe. \u201cWait, what? How\u2019d you know?\u201d I asked, suspiciously.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Chloe growled beside me, glaring at Brandon in a way that was the epitome of menacing. \u201cHow did you know that?\u201d</p><p>Brandon shrugged half-heartedly, looking decidedly less confident. \u201cIan called me last night?\u201d He made it a question, which didn\u2019t help matters any.</p><p>Chloe jumped forward, thankfully releasing my hand before she did, and smacked Brandon\u2019s bare shoulder, making him wince, though I know she didn\u2019t actually hurt him. \u201cYou knew last night and you didn\u2019t tell me?\u201d she yelled. \u201cHow could you?!\u201d</p><p>Brandon back-pedaled quickly. \u201cOkay, so I didn\u2019t know that they were engaged, technically, I just knew he was going to propose, and, come on, we all know there\u2019s no way in hell she\u2019d have said no. He would have tied her up and drug her to the altar regardless, he\u2019s so far gone in love!\u201d</p><p>I smiled at his words, glancing back down at my hand to marvel at my ring. \u201cHe is, isn\u2019t he?\u201d I mused. \u201cAnd of course I said yes!\u201d</p><p>Chloe looked back at me and her face softened. \u201cI\u2019m so happy for you, Lee.\u201d She turned back to Brandon, scowling once more as she said, \u201cIt\u2019s you I\u2019m not so happy with.\u201d</p><p>But, naturally, Brandon just shot her a wink, a shit-eating grin, and grabbed her up in his arms before planting a big, smacking kiss on her lips, and everything was right in the world again.</p> <p>Evidenced clearly by the fact that, as soon as Brandon let her go, Chloe swung back to me, face lit with glee and said, \u201cHey! Let\u2019s have a double wedding!\u201d</p><p>It had taken some doing, but I\u2019d finally extracted myself from Chloe\u2019s clutches and non-stop wedding plans that had suddenly doubled. I\u2019d convinced her that she deserved to have her own special day separate from mine, and therefore, she reluctantly agreed to ditch the double wedding idea, but she was adamant that we start planning mine ASAP. Now that, I didn\u2019t mind.</p><p>Before I left their house, Brandon had stopped me, leaning close to say, \u201cYou know, I\u2019m really happy for you guys. I knew Ian before you guys met, but I\u2019ve gotten to know him a lot better since he literally swept you off your feet. He\u2019s a good guy, treats you good. You deserve that. I\u2019m really happy for you, little sister,\u201d he\u2019d said fondly, wrapping me in his arms in a tight hug. \u201cI thank whoever\u2019s listening every day for bringing your sister and Allie into our shop, because it gave me and Luke the family that we\u2019d never really had.\u201d He\u2019d paused, then whispered, \u201cLove you, Leah.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d hugged him even tighter and whispered back, \u201cLove you, too, Brandon,\u201d and couldn\u2019t help the tears that had gathered in my eyes. But then I was laughing when I\u2019d looked up to see Chloe standing there with her hands clasped to her heart, tears pouring down her face, and she\u2019d said, \u201cDamn you, bitches, for making me cry!\u201d</p><p>After leaving there, I made my way over to my parents\u2019 house to continue making my rounds, since I\u2019d made a lot of calls last night to let my family know that Ian had proposed, and every single person was overjoyed at the news, but I had to promise that I\u2019d visit all of them today so they could get the deets and see the ring. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Although, I\u2019d been the one surprised when I called my parents to find them absolutely unsurprised\u2014but that was only because Ian had actually gone to see them and asked permission to marry me. I\u2019d also found out that (again, surprisingly from my parents) that Ian had called Brandon to tell him what he was doing and to ask him to be his best man. Brandon (and Ian, for that matter) had left out that little detail, too, so I could only laugh as I imagined Chloe slapping Brandon for keeping that from her, as well.</p><p>The visit to my parents\u2019 place was pretty quick, mainly because Ian had already showed my mom the ring, and she\u2019d previously oohed and ahhed over it\u2014but that doesn\u2019t mean she didn\u2019t fuss appropriately over me\u2014cause she totally did. Dad smiled as he grunted, so I took that to mean he was happy. I love my parents...</p><p>My brother, Calland, was next on the list, mainly because I had to pass his place on the way to Jenna\u2019s. He was his usual self, especially since the first words out of his mouth were, \u201cHe knock you up?\u201d He\u2019s an ass, but he did redeem himself by showing his very seldom seen softer side and giving me a hug before he told me that he was very happy for me.</p><p>Jenna reacted much the same way Chloe did, but on a quieter scale because she\u2019d just gotten the baby down for a nap. Noah hugged me, and the kids smiled, but weddings, to them, are no big deal.</p> <p>Emma reacted much the same way as Chloe, but it was twice as bad coming from her because it wasn\u2019t just Emma there. Allie had made sure that she was waiting for me, too, since Emma had called and told her I was coming. I got double-timed, both of them jumping around me, hugging me, and screeching non-stop until Jackson and Luke had to make them quit because they startled the little ones.</p><p>All of the guys had given me big hugs and their own little speeches like Brandon had done, making me tear up once more, I finally headed back home to Ian, who\u2019d still been sleeping when I left. He knew where I was, though, because he\u2019d called me when he woke up, chuckling in my ear when I told him what I was doing.</p><p>He was standing in the doorway when I pulled in, smiling at me. I closed the garage door behind me and walked directly into his arms, my hands sliding up his chest to lock around the back of his neck, pulling his head down to me.</p><p>I met his lips with mine in a lingering, searching kiss, moaning against his mouth as he moved his hands down to my hips, lifting me so that I straddled his waist. We held the kiss for a long moment before I broke it, dropping my legs down with one last peck. He set me down gently on my feet, moving back into the house so I could follow.</p><p>\u201cWell? Did you go show off your bling-bling?\u201d he asked, smirking.</p> <p>\u201cFirst off, never use that word again...\u201d I started, shaking my head and my finger at him. \u201cAnd second, of course I did!\u201d</p><p>I tossed my keys down on the counter with my purse and my phone and then turned back to him. \u201cSo. What are we gonna do today?\u201d I asked, sweetly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Sunday, we have nowhere else to be today, right?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d I replied, popping the \u2018p\u2019 exaggeratedly and grinning.</p><p>\u201cThen what the fuck you standing around here for?\u201d he growled, stepping toward me, his intent gleaming in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cRun, Leah,\u201d he murmured, inching toward me once more.</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I asked smartly. \u201cYou gonna chase me?\u201d I shot him a heated look, my tongue darting out to lick my lips, curling up into a sassy grin when he tracked every movement, his eyes darkening.</p><p>Right then, I knew exactly what my day was going to consist of...</p><p>So I ran.</p><p>And sweet God in heaven did he catch me...again and again and again.</p><p>Chapter 16</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Emma called out in greeting when I walked into Skin Deep, striding past the clients waiting on the comfy leather couches they had arranged in the lobby of the shop. I moved beyond the counter and hugged my sister, then slid onto the empty stool beside her after hanging my coat up on the rack.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d she asked, swiveling her own stool so we were facing each other behind the counter. \u201cAnd why the hell are you wearing shorts? It\u2019s like negative six out there!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI came to see if one of the guys had time to squeeze me in,\u201d I told her. \u201cAnd it\u2019s thirty-nine, not negative six. Yes, before you ask, my legs are freezing, but it\u2019s not like I was running around in shorts for nothing.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019d been a week since the proposal and I was still on cloud nine. Chloe had already practically planned my wedding in that time, and then threatened my life when I told her we were probably just gonna elope like Allie and her brother did. Seriously, if looks could kill, I\u2019d be dead.</p><p>I\u2019d had to convince her that I was just joking (sort of), and then steered the conversation back to her own upcoming nuptials. They\u2019d decided on a Christmas wedding and everything was finally in place and planned completely down to the minute. We just had roughly eight weeks to go and I swear, she got giddier with every passing day. Not that I could blame her, because she seriously deserved all that happiness and more.</p><p>Emma brought me back to the present when she chuckled. \u201cHave you seen the waiting area?\u201d she asked.</p><p>I looked back out and counted five people sitting or standing around the lobby. \u201cAre they all waiting for tattoos?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo. It actually shouldn\u2019t be too long. Most of them are waiting for piercings. It\u2019s weird, really. People have been coming in like crazy for them.\u201d She lowered her voice, leaning in so no one else could hear. \u201cI swear, if one more simpering co-ed comes in here wanting her belly button done...\u201d she trailed off, shaking her head.</p><p>\u201cThat bad?\u201d I asked back, just as quietly.</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be, but they all seem to have a penchant for passing out and then milking the situation for all its worth when the guys show concern.\u201d She rolled her eyes. \u201cI caught one yesterday reaching up and grabbing Luke\u2019s bicep, squeezing it dramatically before she batted her eyelashes and said, \u2018Oh my, you must really work out,\u2019 and then giggled uncontrollably.\u201d</p><p>I winced. \u201cYeesh. That is pretty bad.\u201d Then I smiled, my words laced with amusement when I asked what Luke had said about it, knowing that it\u2019d be good.</p><p>Emma, to her credit, managed to keep her voice low as she told me, \u201cHe just stared at her and asked if she had something in her eye. You know, \u2018cause she kept batting her damn eyelashes like a little twit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised you didn\u2019t smack the eyelashes off her simpering little face,\u201d I muttered wryly as I reached over and stole a mint from the basket she had sitting beside her.</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d she grunted, then laughed.</p><p>I shook my head as I opened the mint, popping it into my mouth as I replied, sighing, \u201cWell, I guess it comes with the territory. You married a hot-ass tattoo artist that has a hot-ass brother tattoo artist, and they have an extra-hot-ass new business partner/tattoo artist. Can you blame the ladies for lining up?\u201d I bit into the mint, breaking it into pieces in my mouth, because I\u2019ve never been able to just let one dissolve. Pity. I might\u2019ve started if I\u2019d known what was coming.</p><p>\u201cSo, I\u2019m extra-hot-ass, huh?\u201d a deep, low, smooth as silk voice said softly, right behind my ear. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I jumped and took a startled breath, sending a small piece of mint rapidly to the back of my throat. I coughed, not quite choking, but not quite breathing right at that second. My embarrassment of T.J. catching me saying what I said just added insult to injury.</p><p>T.J. pounding me on my back wasn\u2019t helping matters any, either, nor was the fact that my sister had jumped off her stool and had my arm in her hands, raising it up in the air and flapping it wildly, yelling, \u201cLift your arm above your head! Breathe!\u201d</p><p>I could feel my face flaming as I noticed that everyone waiting in the lobby was on their feet, eyes riveted to the drama unfolding behind the counter.</p><p>\u201cOkay! Enough!\u201d I hollered once my coughing fit had stopped, my voice hoarse from the combination of coughing, being beaten half-to-death, and embarrassment.</p> <p>T.J. immediately ceased pounding, his hand still resting on my back, and Emma froze, my arm still suspended mid-air, her fingers clenched around it like a vise, so, of course, that\u2019s exactly the tableau that was laid out before Luke and Brandon when they walked up front from their studios.</p><p>\u201cWhy am I not surprised?\u201d I heard Luke mutter, just as Brandon asked, laughingly, \u201cWhat the hell is going on out here?\u201d</p><p>T.J. patted my back, gently this time, thank you God, as he quietly asked, \u201cYou good?\u201d</p><p>I nodded and jerked my arm away from Emma, scowling at her.</p><p>\u201cHey, Mom always did it to us and all the grandbabies...\u201d she mumbled, shrugging.</p> <p>I snorted and shook my head as exasperated laughter bubbled from my lips. \u201cGood Lord, there\u2019s never a dull moment around this damn family,\u201d I sighed, sliding off the stool. I waved my hand toward the lobby, calling, \u201cI\u2019m fine, everything\u2019s good, someone will be with you shortly,\u201d urging them to ignore me again. Most of them (laughing, of course) sat back down, or turned their attention back to whatever they were doing previously while they waited.</p><p>That left me with the attention of the said hot-ass tattoo artists and my sister, who, traitor that she is, gleefully filled Luke and Brandon in on why I was choking and hacking all over their counter.</p><p>\u201cShe choked on a mint when T.J. heard her calling you all hot-ass tattoo artists.\u201d</p><p>Luke\u2019s lips twitched and, shaking his head, he turned away without saying a word, heading back to his studio.</p><p>Brandon\u2019s mouth opened and shut a few times before he pressed his lips tightly together, I\u2019m assuming to hold back the (naturally) smart-assed and (most definitely) inappropriate comments sitting on his tongue. He finally settled on a wink and a shit-eating grin as he, too, made his way back down the hall to his own studio.</p><p>T.J., however, didn\u2019t move. Nor did he even try to contain the mirth plastered across his face, now that I wasn\u2019t in danger of choking to death. \u201cWhat\u2019s up? Where\u2019s Ian?\u201d he asked me.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s still at work, trying to finish up a job. He\u2019ll be here when he\u2019s done, if I\u2019m not a home before then. I came in to see if any of you had time to squeeze me in for a tattoo, but,\u201d I glanced around the lobby again. \u201cYou guys are pretty busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get you, if you don\u2019t mind waiting a little bit.\u201d He turned to Emma. \u201cChase Ledford\u2019s design is done. Will you call and get him scheduled?\u201d</p><p>She nodded and then handed him the signed consent form and info sheet for his next client. \u201cThese are mostly walk-ins for piercings,\u201d she said, motioning to the room. \u201cThat guy, that girl, and that guy,\u201d she said, pointing quickly, \u201care here to see about tattoos.\u201d</p><p>Before T.J. could say anything, Emma continued. \u201cJust looking, picking out of the books, probably just flash, in and out, will wait.\u201d</p><p>T.J. grunted, apparently because he understood what she\u2019d just said. I didn\u2019t, but who asked me?</p><p>He called his next client back with him and disappeared with a quick smile and a \u2018wait here\u2019 motion to me.</p><p>Emma swiveled on her stool once more. \u201cAlright, give. You don\u2019t just show up here out of the blue for a tattoo on a whim.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cYes, I do. I told you that when I came in and you asked what I was doing here. Did you forget already? Remember, the whole conversation about shorts and the weather and...are you getting senile?\u201d</p> <p>She narrowed her eyes at me. \u201cDon\u2019t deflect. Just answer the question. I\u2019m so sorry I didn\u2019t ask it as soon as you walked in the door, but we got a little sidetracked in conversation and coughing fits, remember? Now spill!\u201d</p><p>I gave her a wide-eyed look. \u201cSeriously, Emma, I just came in to get another tattoo.\u201d I paused, smiling. \u201cAnd Ian is working, Chloe is helping her mom with something, and I was bored.\u201d</p><p>Looking at me suspiciously, she responded, \u201cYou sure that\u2019s it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God! Yes, Emma!\u201d</p><p>She cocked her head and raised her shoulder, giving me a haughty-raised brow look as she dead-panned, \u201cOkay, fine. Whatever.\u201d</p><p>After that, we both giggled and the conversation turned to tattoos and wedding plans. I helped her answer the phone and handed the guys paperwork as they worked through the waiting clients. There was only one left when Ian sauntered in the door, looking dirty, disheveled, exhausted, but still so sexy he took my breath away.</p><p>I sighed, not even realizing I was doing it, until my sister laughed at me and nudged me with her elbow.</p><p>\u201cI remember those days,\u201d she said, dreamily, staring off into space. \u201cWhen just the sight of your man takes your breath away and then makes you wanna run to him and tear his clothes off and make hot monkey love to him sixteen ways to Sunday.\u201d</p><p>Ian stopped in front of me, his lips twitching with laughter as he mouthed, \u2018Hot monkey love?\u2019 to me silently.</p><p>I pursed my lips and nodded my head solemnly, mouthing back, \u2018Yep. So hot. So monkey-ey.\u2019</p><p>He couldn\u2019t contain his chuckle any longer and let it out, his mouth stretching into a full grin.</p><p>Emma jerked her head to the side and looked at Ian. \u201cYou laughing at me, Ian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. I would never, dear sister-in-law-to-be,\u201d he said cheekily. \u201cBut I might need to get some pointers from your husband on how to make hot monkey love sixteen ways to Sunday.\u201d</p><p>Emma\u2019s cheeks flushed and she muttered, \u201cAsshole,\u201d under her breath, making Ian laugh even more.</p><p>He turned back to me. \u201cYou get your tattoo, yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. They were pretty slammed when I got here, but T.J. said he\u2019d do it if I waited. You wanna go home and get cleaned up? Wait for me there?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNah. I\u2019ll wait with you. Unless you\u2019re trying to get rid of me, already?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. Not a chance in hell, buddy. You\u2019re stuck for life,\u201d I told him, tipping my head back and puckering my lips at him, wordlessly asking for a kiss.</p><p>He moved behind the counter and pecked my lips quickly. \u201cI\u2019m all hot, dirty, and sweaty. You don\u2019t want me too close until I get cleaned up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmmm...you make that sound so sexy...\u201d I waggled my eyebrows at him, earning another shake of his head.</p><p>Emma snorted, then commented, \u201cHot and sweaty? Leah and I just had this conversation. It\u2019s like negative two outside, so how can you be hot and sweaty?\u201d</p><p>Ian (with a straight face, might I add) said, \u201cEmma, it\u2019s thirty-nine, not negative two. And some of us actually do manual labor that makes us hot and sweaty, even in the cold. You know, unlike others who sit in nice warm buildings all day...\u201d He winked at Emma when she sputtered in mock-outrage, and the two went back and forth for a bit, bantering good-naturedly, as usual. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A few minutes later, Brandon came out and took the last waiting client back after saying hi to Ian, so when T.J. emerged from his studio room, he looked around to double check that he wasn\u2019t missing anyone waiting still and then jerked his head for me to follow him as he greeted Ian, as well.</p><p>Ian and I followed him down the hall, but Ian peeled off to go wash up a bit. I settled into the chair in the middle of T.J.\u2019s studio room as he asked if I knew what I wanted.</p><p>\u201cI want just a line of script across the front of my upper thigh. Easy peasy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have any particular font you\u2019re wanting?\u201d he asked me.</p> <p>\u201cCan you just write it out for me, see what you can do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Here, write it down for me and I\u2019ll work on it for a minute, see what you think.\u201d</p><p>I took the scrap of paper and pen from him and wrote what I wanted before handing it back to him.</p><p>He glanced over it and then nodded at me. \u201cI like that. What\u2019s it from? It sounds kind of familiar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s from an e.e. cummings poem, my father moved through dooms of love.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHmm.\u201d</p><p>With that, he turned away from me and began writing, but it didn\u2019t take him long. And as soon as he turned and handed me the paper where he\u2019d scripted the quote, I handed it right back and said, \u201cPerfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure? You don\u2019t want me to try a couple different ways, or-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. That\u2019s perfect, T.J. Thanks,\u201d I told him with a smile.</p><p>Not long after that, I was the proud owner of new ink, scrawled flawlessly in simplistically beautiful script across my thigh...</p><p>\u2018love is the whole and more than all.\u2019</p> <p>And I loved it.</p><p>Chapter 17</p><p>\u201cRemind me again why I told Chloe about our engagement?\u201d I groaned to Ian as I face planted into his chest as he walked into the house.</p><p>I burrowed against him and then paused, taking a good long sniff at his shirt. I pulled back, my face scrunching up. \u201cWhy do you smell like you took a bath in perfume?\u201d</p><p>It was early afternoon on Saturday and Ian had had to go down to his office to finish up some paperwork. I stayed home to do a couple things that I had to finish before Monday.</p><p>He grimaced and pulled away from me, which immediately raised my hackles because I knew right then what had happened. \u201cShe was there, again, wasn\u2019t she.\u201d</p><p>He let out a breath and nodded.</p><p>\u201cJesus criminey, what the fuck did she do this time? And why can\u2019t she get shit through her fucking head, that she is not welcome anywhere near us?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know, baby. I was working in the office when she came in, said she saw my truck and wanted to say hi and apologize for everything. Tried to get me to agree to lunch as part of it, but she left when I told her no. She didn\u2019t act crazy or anything, surprisingly.\u201d</p><p>I crossed my arms and shot him a skeptical look.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m being serious. She was her normal self...well, as normal as she was before all this shit escalated. Gave me a hug before she left, and even asked me to apologize to you for her, because she knows that you probably never want to see her again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding me? Fuck no, I don\u2019t want to see her face! Nor do I want her plastering herself all over you, even if it is an apology hug. She gets no hugs, do you hear me? Why were you so nice to her?\u201d I asked, plaintively.</p><p>\u201cLeah,\u201d he pleaded. \u201cI wasn\u2019t really nice to her. I just wasn\u2019t really mean. I didn\u2019t want to chance setting her off again, especially when you were home alone. You know I wouldn\u2019t do anything to encourage her...\u201d</p><p>I sighed. \u201cI know. I just...I just don\u2019t trust her Ian. I have a feeling that the minute you show her some kindness, no matter how small it may be, she\u2019s gonna run with it in ways that will probably end up with me in jail. And I\u2019m just saying, orange is not my color.\u201d</p><p>Ian chuckled and leaned in, kissing me chastely on my forehead. \u201cI\u2019m gonna go take a shower. Wanna come keep me company?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come watch,\u201d I told him, winking saucily and then slapping his ass when he turned to walk away.</p><p>He was in the shower and I was sitting on the counter, painting my toenails when he asked, \u201cSo, why are you regretting telling Chloe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEh. I\u2019m not really. She\u2019s just in the wedding planning mode and now that her wedding is all set, she\u2019s focused on ours.\u201d</p><p>I finished one foot and started on the other. \u201cNot that I mind...but honestly, I don\u2019t know if I want a big huge wedding, and you and I haven\u2019t even gotten to talk about it, yet. You know?\u201d</p><p>A grunted \u2018hmm\u2019 came from the shower.</p><p>I looked up from my toes. \u201cHmm? That\u2019s all you have to say?\u201d I rolled my eyes, muttering, \u2018men\u2019 under my breath.</p><p>Ian sighed and responded with a placating, \u201cWhatever you want, Leah. I just want you to be happy.\u201d</p><p>I snorted. \u201cUh huh...sure.\u201d</p><p>I finished my toes and had just slid off the counter when Ian shut the water off and stepped out, grabbing his towel.</p><p>\u201cHey, Brandon called me earlier while I was at the office and asked if we were still on for tonight. Your mom and dad are gonna keep the kids, I guess, so Allie and Jacks are coming, too. He also told me to tell you that Emma\u2019s making liquid cocaine again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmmm...\u201d I moaned. \u201cThat stuff is so yummy, but damn, it\u2019s potent! Yeah, we\u2019re still on, if you still want to go.\u201d</p><p>Ian left the bathroom to dress and I followed, doing the crazy toes-up duck walk that all women do when their toes are freshly polished and still susceptible to smears, dings, and imprints.</p><p>Ian\u2019s voice was muffled from the closet when he answered me. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s fine. But just so you know, we\u2019ve all agreed that you\u2019re not dancing on the bar this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, what do you mean, this time? I\u2019ve never even been to this club before. Don\u2019t try to punish me and Chloe for something that my sister and Allie did a long time ago.\u201d</p><p>He moved out of the closet, pulling a t-shirt over his head. \u201cI\u2019m just relaying the message. Your sister and Allie cooked this whole thing up to go dancing, and the last time they did, they ended up dancing on the bar and almost causing a riot. According to your brother-in-law, anyway. I wasn\u2019t there.\u201d</p><p>He leveled me with a dark look. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll be damned if my woman will be up there shaking her ass where anyone but me could see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you gonna do? Bash me over the head with your club and drag me home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s what it takes,\u201d he said, smirking.</p><p>\u201cUgh. Neanderthal.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cYou love me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lucky,\u201d I quipped, then changed the subject. \u201cI\u2019m hungry,\u201d I whined, sticking my lip out in a pout.</p><p>Ian banged on his chest with his fist and grunted. \u201cMe caveman, get you meat. Feed woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa, ha, ha...cute,\u201d I said sarcastically, then shook my head, muttering, \u201cAsshole.\u201d</p><p>He just laughed and tackled me backwards onto the bed, kissing my neck and jaw before claiming my lips in a hot, wet kiss.</p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d I moaned, opening to him, but it was over just as quickly as it began. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He lightly slapped my hip as he stood, reaching his hand down to help me up. \u201cC\u2019mon, let\u2019s get you some food,\u201d he said, smiling.</p><p>\u201cWait a second, who\u2019s DD tonight?\u201d I called out, talking over everyone as we stood in Emma\u2019s kitchen, dressed to the nines and ready to have some fun.</p><p>Chloe glanced over. \u201cYou obviously weren\u2019t paying attention a minute ago. We already discussed this. Luke and Jacks are being DD\u2019s tonight, just in case your parents need anything with the little ones.\u201d</p><p>I nudged Ian and waggled my eyebrows at him crazily. \u201cKnow what that means, big man?\u201d</p> <p>He just grinned and shook his head, tipping back his beer and finishing it off.</p><p>Chloe, Allie, Emma, and I all grabbed our glasses of liquid cocaine and finished them off, then hustled the guys out to Brandon\u2019s Expedition, which he\u2019d offered up so we\u2019d only have to take one vehicle. We were pretty scrunched up, but we made it work. Luke drove and Emma made Jacks sit up front, while Emma, Chloe, and Brandon sat in the middle, and Ian, Allie, and I all crawled into the back.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take very long to reach The Dungeon, which is the relatively new club we were going to. It had been opened for almost two years now, but I hadn\u2019t been there, yet. I didn\u2019t really hit up the clubs anymore since Ian and I started dating, except for that time my sister and I dragged Luke and Ian to Shimbots with us for a drag show. But that\u2019s a story for another day.</p><p>When we finally got in the door and settled into a large, circular booth, Emma leaned in close to me so I could hear her over the music. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>I looked around the club, taking in the dimness, the black, red, and silver color scheme, and the cages on either side of the stage area. \u201cLooks pretty much like I expected, only a little less...dungeon-y.\u201d</p> <p>She shrugged and grabbed Allie\u2019s arm, tugging on it as she nudged Luke to slid out of the booth and let her out. \u201cWe\u2019re going to dance while you get drinks,\u201d she told him, then jerked her head and me and Chloe, signaling us to join her.</p><p>Two hours later, it was pretty safe to say that we were having a good time. All of us were half-lit (some more so than others...okay, so mainly the girls) and exhausted from dancing, and had finally taken a break.</p><p>But that\u2019s when Victoria sauntered up to the table, one of the waitresses following behind her with a tray full of shot glasses.</p><p>\u201cHey, guys,\u201d she called, happily. Her gaze settled on Ian and she shot him a dazzling grin, ignoring the chill in his eyes. \u201cPeace offering. I got shots for everyone, so drink up, okay?\u201d</p><p>She turned to me. \u201cLeta-\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeah,\u201d Ian growled, interrupting her. \u201cHer name is Leah, and you damn well know it. What the fuck are you doing, Victoria?\u201d</p> <p>The music was loud in the club, but they were talking louder to be heard over the music and it was beginning to draw attention from other people around us.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m apologizing, if you\u2019ll quit interrupting me, Ian,\u201d she said to him before turning back to me once more. \u201cLeah,\u201d she began, putting emphasis on my correct name, even though she still rolled her eyes slightly as she said it, \u201cI\u2019m really sorry for everything and I\u2019d love to make it up to you. Ian wouldn\u2019t let me call you, though, so here I am, doing it now.\u201d</p><p>Emma stood up and leaned over the table, her face dark and angry. \u201cLook. I don\u2019t know what kind of sick, twisted game you\u2019re planning, but you need to go. There\u2019s no reason for you to ever speak to my sister, or to Ian, ever again. You\u2019ve caused enough trouble, and I don\u2019t even know how you knew we were here tonight, but you aren\u2019t welcome. GO. AWAY.\u201d</p><p>Luke put his hand on Emma\u2019s shoulder in a restraining motion. She let him guide her back into her seat, but by that time, the waitress had stepped forward, eyeing us warily.</p><p>\u201cOkay, these shots are paid for, so I\u2019m setting \u2018em down here. Drink \u2018em or not, but we don\u2019t want no trouble. If y\u2019all are gonna fight, you\u2019re gonna hafta leave.\u201d</p><p>I stood up now. \u201cThere\u2019s no trouble, there\u2019s not going to be any fighting. Thank you for the shots, but no, we\u2019re not going to drink them. Give them to another table,\u201d I told the waitress, and then turned to Victoria.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll accept your apology, Victoria. But that doesn\u2019t mean that we want anything to do with you. I don\u2019t want you around Ian, and neither does he. I\u2019m not your friend, I never will be, and Ian is merely a former acquaintance to you. Stay away from me, stay away from Ian, stay away from my family.\u201d</p><p>With that, I sat down and dismissed her with a flick of my hand. My heart was pounding out of my chest, and, even though she\u2019s a menace, I felt really bad when tears welled up in Victoria\u2019s eyes.</p> <p>That feeling didn\u2019t last long, though, because her face turned hard, and that cold, calculating look was back. It was fleeting, but it was there. She hid it well, covering her face with her hands and letting out a sob. She mumbled another apology and stumbled away from the table, moving quickly for the exit.</p><p>The table was silent, every eye on me. I pasted a smile across my face as Ian dropped his arm around me and squeezed me against his side.</p><p>We left the club not long after that, the mood pretty much ruined for the night. Jacks drove this time, but he still dropped everyone off at their respective houses, because we had been drinking, regardless, even though the buzz was definitely gone.</p><p>When Ian and I were lying in bed a little while later, I rolled into his arms and buried my face against his chest.</p><p>\u201cHow the fuck did she know where we were?\u201d My words were muffled against his skin, but he still heard me.</p><p>He heaved a sigh before he answered. \u201cShe had to have been watching or something. I don\u2019t know. She was so...normal...earlier.\u201d</p><p>I lifted my head. \u201cYeah, and remember what I said? Give her an inch and she\u2019ll take a mile. She\u2019s off her fucking rocker, Ian!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he sighed, cuddling me close again. \u201cI know, baby.\u201d</p><p>I drifted to sleep, my head on Ian\u2019s chest, but my mind was churning. The last thing I thought of before the darkness claimed me was, \u2018what next?\u2019</p><p>Chapter 18</p><p>The next couple of weeks were a flurry of activity to prepare for the holidays and for Chloe and Brandon\u2019s wedding. Not that there was anything left to do, with the exception of the last minute things that couldn\u2019t be done until closer to the wedding, but I had a bachelorette party that I was in charge of.</p><p>I figured I\u2019d con Allie into helping me, since she did such an awesome job with my sister\u2019s, but it didn\u2019t take any conning at all. She was up for the task and had already made a list of things that she was going to give me, whether I wanted her help or not.</p><p>Of course, I did check with Sarah, Chloe\u2019s mom to make sure she\u2019d be okay with what we had planned. We didn\u2019t bother even checking with Allie\u2019s mom or mine, because, let\u2019s face it; they\u2019re good with whatever crazy shit we come up with, even though they might shake their heads and ask where they went wrong with us.</p><p>Or maybe that was more my mom than Allie\u2019s, given that Daisy and George were more...we\u2019ll call it free-spirited and free-loving.</p><p>So, with Allie\u2019s help (and Emma\u2019s, because she didn\u2019t want to be left out), the party was planned, reservations were made, and we were ready to rock, especially after our trip to Hustler for all things penis in the way of party favors. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ian was cautiously amused at the amount of penis paraphernalia that was lying around our house, but he made me store it all in the spare bedroom (and double check to make sure I got it all) when he sat down on the couch after his shower one evening, only to discover that he was being poked in the butt-cheek by a stray jumbo, fruit flavored cock pop that had apparently slipped between the couch cushions. In my defense, I\u2019d dumped everything out of the bags into piles on the couch (I ran out of room on the coffee table) to make kind of an assembly line when I was putting together my party favor gift bags for everyone.</p><p>So sue me for missing one huge, hot pink, penis shaped sucker. And the two penis straws and a tin of dick mints that were down in the couch, too.</p><p>Thankfully, we hadn\u2019t seen hide nor hair of Victoria since that night when we went out, but that didn\u2019t mean I was resting easy. I had a sneaking suspicion that she would try something on Thanksgiving, but Ian had stopped that before it even started.</p><p>Ian\u2019s parents had invited us to their posh, catered dinner party for the holiday, but since they invited the Jones family, regardless of everything that Ian had told them, he\u2019d advised them in no uncertain terms that it\u2019d be a cold day in hell before we\u2019d show up. I felt bad for him, because they are still his parents, but he was adamant that he refused to stand for me being disrespected by their ridiculous notions. But, of course, I was absolutely jumping for joy on the inside that I didn\u2019t have to spend any time with them.</p> <p>The day of Thanksgiving, Ian and I went over to my parents\u2019 house early so I could help my mom. She\u2019d called two days earlier and asked if I would (like I\u2019d say no), and Ian had just come with me rather than having two separate vehicles there, so he was in the living room with my dad, who was flipping back and forth between the two parade channels and bitching that football wasn\u2019t on yet.</p><p>I was cubing up blocks of Colby cheese for my mom\u2019s homemade mac &amp; cheese while my mom chopped onion and celery for the stuffing when she asked me, out of nowhere, \u201cAre you happy?\u201d</p><p>I blinked in surprise. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you happy?\u201d she asked again.</p><p>\u201cWell, yes, Mom, I am. Why would you ask me that?\u201d</p> <p>She shrugged one shoulder and continued to work, chopping vegetables without missing a beat. \u201cI\u2019ve asked both of your sisters that at one time or other. It\u2019s a relevant question. I want to know that my children are really, truly happy with their lives. So can you answer your momma, please?\u201d She huffed and pursed her lips at me, but I could see the twinkle of laughter in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cYes, Mom,\u201d I said, my lips tilting up in an indulgent half-smile. \u201cI\u2019m happy. He makes me very happy, as you well know. Otherwise, I wouldn\u2019t be marrying the man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. That\u2019s all I need to know. So how about this Icktoria bitch? You punched her in the face, yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom!\u201d I exclaimed, laughing. \u201cNo, I haven\u2019t punched her in the face. Do you want your child to go to jail?\u201d I asked her, shaking my head. \u201cI take it Emma and Allie opened their big mouths and told you what happened at the dance club that night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes a bear shit in the woods?\u201d</p><p>I dropped my head and sighed. \u201cYou could have just said yes, Mom. Simply yes would have worked.\u201d</p> <p>She just hummed and tossed the chopped vegetables into a bowl. \u201cHave you talked to your brother lately?\u201d she asked, changing the subject.</p><p>She\u2019s good at that, and she does it randomly, with a quickness.</p><p>I loaded the chopped cheese into the baking dish with the cooked macaroni and reached for the milk, shaking my head as I did. \u201cWhy? What\u2019s he done, now?\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cI just wish he\u2019d settle down, or at least find someone decent to date. I\u2019ve had enough of the Buffy, Kitty, Nimby-Pimby girls he\u2019s been seeing lately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNimby-Pimby? Mom, seriously. Those aren\u2019t even words. And Calland will settle down, eventually. He just needs to find the girl that won\u2019t take his shit and puts him in his place.\u201d I smiled. \u201cGod, I can\u2019t wait to watch that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould be pretty interesting, I\u2019ll give you that,\u201d Mom commented, moving to the sink to wash her hands. \u201cSo, when are you gonna give me grandbabies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, Mom!\u201d</p><p>Ian was shaking his head, his shoulders bouncing with silent laughter.</p> <p>We were all sitting around the table, stuffing our faces with the overabundance of food that had been prepared for the day, talking over one another, and having a good time, in general, but in that moment, I knew exactly what had caught Ian\u2019s eye and caused his laughter.</p><p>But then, so did my sister, who groaned and dropped her head onto my shoulder, since she was sitting next to me.</p><p>\u201cMother! How many times have we told you not to give him eggs?\u201d she whined as she watched our mom slip a deviled egg under the table to the waiting yellow lab snout we knew was resting on her knee.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she said, defensively. \u201cI\u2019m not doing anything!\u201d</p><p>Yes, she said that with a completely straight face as she slipped a sliver of turkey under the table to the black lab snout we all knew was resting on her other knee, the yellow one\u2019s perfect counterpart and partner in crime.</p><p>Luke wisely kept his mouth closed, not bothering to argue with his mother-in-law, but his lips were twitching.</p><p>\u201cDoug! D.J.!\u201d Emma yelled, lifting her head and then hunching down to peek under the table at the wagging tails attached to the opposite end of the snouts that were currently chomping down on whatever else Mom had slipped to them.</p><p>\u201cMight as well give it up,\u201d I muttered to her. \u201cYou know they won\u2019t leave her side.\u201d</p><p>She glared at me and then sat back up, shrugging. \u201cThat\u2019s fine. You know the rules. Dogs are yours for the night, Mom. And you know what\u2019s going to happen. Happens every time you give Doug eggs, and then Dad bitches at you, you call me complaining and swearing because he\u2019s stinking up the house...\u201d She crossed her arms and stared at Mom defiantly. \u201cHope you\u2019re happy.\u201d</p><p>Ever since Luke and Emma had gotten together, Doug, and now D.J., were required to attend every family event at my parents\u2019 house, especially Thanksgiving. In fact, the very first Thanksgiving Doug had attended with my family, my mom had set him up with his own little plate at the kitchen table, and fed him with a fork. Now that there\u2019s two of them, she\u2019s settled for simply feeding them from her plate while they hide under the table with their heads in her lap, but they still get their fair share of the Thanksgiving feast, no matter how many times Emma pleads with her to stop.</p><p>And Emma\u2019s right; she gives Doug deviled eggs every time, and without fail, Emma and Luke leave him (and now D.J., too) at their house for the night, and Doug returns the favor by passing enough toxic fumes from his rear end to choke a horse and subjecting my poor parents to the stench.</p><p>It\u2019s a vicious, hilarious circle, but hey...that\u2019s my family.</p><p>After dinner, we all tucked into the stock pile of desserts, laughing as usual when Calland (who had actually refrained from hiding the mac &amp; cheese from her this year) started messing with Emma.</p><p>She\u2019d gotten a piece of pecan pie smothered in whipped cream, and was feeding Everly small bites of the whip cream in between taking bites of her pie. Whenever she\u2019d turn to the baby, who was sitting in the high chair beside her, Calland would move the plate just enough that when she\u2019d turn back, her elbow would cruise through the whipped cream, smearing all over her sleeve. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She kept swearing and calling herself a klutz as she wiped it off, but eventually our snickers gave it away and she flicked a spoonful of whipped cream at Calland\u2019s face. He ducked, of course, causing the cream to splatter on the wall behind him.</p><p>I guess it was only right that Mom made Calland clean up the mess...but then she could only stand there and laugh while shaking her head when he called D.J. over, hefted him into his arms, and let the dog lick the mess off the wall.</p><p>My family hung out for a while after everything was cleared away and the leftovers divvyed up, until Jenna and Noah took the kids and headed to Noah\u2019s parents\u2019 house for their Thanksgiving dinner. Since we didn\u2019t have anywhere else to go, Ian and I went home while the rest of my siblings scattered to do whatever else they had planned.</p><p>When we got home, I changed into comfy clothes and collapsed onto the couch, reaching for the remote. Ian grabbed it before I could, though.</p><p>\u201cHey, give that back,\u201d I said, half-heartedly.</p><p>He waved it in the air and said, \u201cCome get it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeh. I\u2019m too lazy. Anything good on?\u201d</p><p>He flipped through channels before answering. \u201cThat would be a negative. Want to watch a movie?\u201d</p><p>Since we had nothing else pressing to do (besides the fact that I needed to clean Gerry\u2019s cage out since he was home with me on Thanksgiving vacation), I agreed, and that\u2019s just what we did. When the first movie was over, Ian stretched his arms up and blinked at me in the darkness of the room. We hadn\u2019t bothered to turn any lights on, and night was falling outside.</p><p>\u201cDamn. I didn\u2019t realize that movie was so long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t either. Oh well, though. Perfect end to the day, don\u2019t you think? Lazing around watching movies...and we\u2019ve got plenty of leftovers if you\u2019re hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. I think I\u2019m still full. Maybe a snack here in a little bit. What now, another movie?\u201d he asked me, kicking back in the recliner once more.</p><p>\u201cSure. I need wine first though.\u201d I hopped up and headed for the kitchen, just the remembering the unopened bottle of ice wine I had in the fridge. Once I was looking in the fridge, though, the strawberries we\u2019d bought a couple days ago were staring me in the face, so I decided that those needed to go with me, too.</p><p>Before I was done, I\u2019d had to grab a cookie sheet as a make-shift tray to cart my movie watching spread into the living room.</p><p>Ian glanced at me as I walked by him and then did a very noticeable double-take. \u201cHoly shit! I thought you were just getting some wine?\u201d</p><p>I grinned sheepishly. \u201cI was. Then I saw the strawberries and they looked good, so I grabbed them. Then I remembered I had chocolate fruit dip for them, and you know strawberries are best with chocolate, so when I got that out, I saw the whipped cream. That\u2019s a no brainer. So, I guess I was hungry.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged and then slid the makeshift tray onto the coffee table, sitting cross-legged on the floor behind it, and leaned back against the couch.</p><p>\u201cAnd the pineapple?\u201d Ian asked, conversationally once I was settled.</p><p>\u201cIt looked good. Don\u2019t judge me!\u201d I popped the lid off the can of whipped cream and grabbed a plump, ripe berry, holding it up while I squirted it with a perfectly spiraled dollop. \u201cWant one?\u201d</p><p>He declined, but he did come lay behind me on the couch, so in between bites and sips of wine, I\u2019d lean my head down on his chest and he\u2019d play idly with my hair as we watched the movie.</p><p>By the time the movie was over, I\u2019d put a decent dent in the fruit, and the bottle of wine was empty, (In my defense, bottles of ice wine are smaller than normal!) and I was feeling pretty mellow, especially when Ian\u2019s hands started roaming.</p><p>I moaned at his touch, my head dropping down against his chest again, but then his fingers slid into my hair and pulled my head up once more. He shifted, leaning close enough to capture my lips with his in a soft, barely there kiss.</p><p>His tongue darted out and probed the seam of my lips, slipping deftly inside to tangle with mine when I parted my lips to allow him entry.</p> <p>\u201cMmm...\u201d he whispered against my mouth. \u201cYou taste good. Sweet and fruity. Do you taste like that everywhere?\u201d he asked, his lips caressing mine softly with every word.</p><p>Breathless, I answered, \u201cMaybe you should find out.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d meant the words as a joke...a tease...but that\u2019s just what he did.</p><p>Chapter 19</p><p>Ian\u2019s hands made short work of my clothes until I was laid bare on the floor, the carpet\u2019s usual softness feeling almost rough against my highly-sensitized skin. He shoved the coffee table out of the way, but I had my wits about me enough to noticed that he\u2019d grabbed the can of whipped cream before he did, tossing it on the couch beside him.</p><p>He knelt beside me and used his hands to part my thighs, sliding them up and down and around in a teasing caress until I was spread wide, every inch of me open to his heated gaze. He licked his lips and I shivered, the sight immediately bringing thoughts of those lips, that tongue on me...in me...to my mind.</p><p>Ian\u2019s voice was low, gravelly with lust when he said, \u201cWhat are you shivering for, baby? Are you cold?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, my breathing coming in pants as he peppered my open thighs with tiny, fluttering kisses and quick, sharp nips of his teeth, both ramping up the want flooding my core until it was almost unbearable. \u201cPlease,\u201d I whimpered, gasping when he pressed an open mouthed kiss to the bare flesh of my mound, just above that aching, hardened nub begging for his attention.</p><p>\u201cIs this what you want?\u201d he breathed against my skin, the tip of his tongue flicking out to trace one tiny circle around my clit, so softly I could barely feel it.</p><p>My hips arched up, begging him silently to give me more, but he pulled away. I cried out, but my dismay was short lived when he moved back over me almost immediately, the can of whipped cream in his hands and a wicked gleam in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cOooh...\u201d The helpless sound escaped my lips at the feel of the chilled cream against my heated skin.</p><p>Ian squirted a line of whipped cream across the top of my sex, then added two more dots, this time on top of each of my turgid nipples. Without missing a beat, he tossed the can away from him and leaned over my body, taking one whipped cream coated nipple in his mouth, sucking and licking away the sweetness before subjecting the other one to the same treatment.</p><p>Once they were clean, he kissed down my stomach and closed his mouth over me, whipped cream and all. He ate at me voraciously, alternately sucking my clit into his mouth and flicking his tongue over it until I was writhing against his face. He gripped my hips with his hands, trying to hold me still, and plunged his tongue deep inside my entrance, fucking me with long sure strokes.</p><p>\u201cOh my God! Oh, fuck...\u201d I screamed out, my hands fisting in his hair and pulling his face tighter into my sex, thrusting my hips up and fucking his face wildly as he continued to spear his tongue into me. I could feel my release rushing up, an epic wave of sensation towering over my body, poised and ready to crash over me, drown me, completely take me under.</p><p>Ian slid his tongue up through my folds and unerringly found my clit, sucking it between his lips and nipping it gently but firmly, and the wave broke. I came on a keening cry, my hands clenching so tightly in Ian\u2019s hair that I knew I had to be hurting him, but I couldn\u2019t stop. He kept up the exquisite torture, wringing desperate cries from my lips until I was a quivering mess, begging him to stop, even though my hands told a different story, still holding him close as I ground my hips up into his mouth, and even then, he didn\u2019t stop he\u2019d lapped up every last drop of my release. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I collapsed back onto the carpet, breasts heaving with every ragged breath I sucked in, attempting to regulate my body once more, but it was hard to do with the aftershocks coursing through me, almost like I was short circuiting.</p><p>I forced my eyes open, glancing down the length of my body to see Ian\u2019s face, eyes dark and heavy-lidded with desire, staring back at me, his mouth still hovering over my folds. I could see my wetness glistening on his face, and just the sight of it made my stomach drop as want curled through me once more.</p><p>He licked his lips, the corner of his mouth tipping up in a wicked smile. \u201cMmm...sweet and creamy...you do taste good everywhere.\u201d</p><p>I gasped. \u201cIan,\u201d I moaned, heat suffusing my skin. It didn\u2019t matter that I\u2019d just come hard all over his face, he just had to look at her and she was ready.</p><p>\u201cReady to go to bed?\u201d he asked me, his voice deep and low.</p><p>I nodded vigorously and his smile grew. He leaned down and lifted me in his arms, shifting until I was straddling his lap where he knelt. He lightly tapped my ass as he kissed my lips softly, pulling away before I could take it deeper.</p><p>\u201cShut the lights off, baby, while I put away this stuff,\u201d he said, gesturing to my movie snacks.</p><p>\u201cYeah, you definitely want to put that whipped cream back in the fridge. We don\u2019t want that going bad...\u201d I winked and stood, watching as he gathered everything up and turned for the kitchen.</p><p>I shut the lights off, with the exception of the kitchen and hall so Ian would have some light, and practically ran for the bedroom, sprawling out in the center of the bed on top of the covers, but then quickly jumping up and dashing to the bathroom to clean the residual stickiness of the whipped cream from my body, before diving back onto the bed.</p><p>Ian followed soon after. I watched his shadow moving into the room in the darkness, heard the rustle of him shedding his clothes, the softness of his footsteps as he stalked the bed. A shiver of anticipation worked its way up my spine.</p><p>I felt his weight depress the bed beside me and then he was over me, sliding his body against mine until we were chest to chest, his hips settling snugly into the cradle of my outspread thighs. I groaned as he dragged the thick, heated length of his cock against my slit.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so wet for me,\u201d he whispered in the darkness.</p><p>\u201cAlways,\u201d I moaned, arching into his thrust as the head of him stroked directly over my clit.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna fuck you, baby, and while I\u2019m doing it, you\u2019re gonna play with yourself,\u201d he rasped, his voice soft, but no less demanding.</p><p>A small mew of assent was about all the response I could drum up at the moment as he moved his hands behind my knees and pressed upwards, drawing my legs up and out as he slid inside my channel.</p><p>He gave a couple shallow thrusts before he filled me completely, his hands still holding my legs wide, then growled, \u201cNow, Leah. Reach down here and rub that pretty little clit for me.\u201d</p><p>I complied, sliding my fingers down my stomach and over my mound, sighing in pleasure as I brushed over my clit. I circled the nubbin gently, then moved my hand lower, feeling the heat and wetness where our bodies were joined, felt the silky, hot length of Ian\u2019s cock sliding between my fingers as he filled me over and over again.</p><p>He groaned at the feel of my fingers touching the base of him while he was buried inside my sheath, the walls of my sex clasping him tightly, drawing him further inside me, but I didn\u2019t linger. His thrusts became heavier, harder, eliciting the thick, meaty sound of skin slapping skin as he pounded into me.</p><p>I moved my free hand up to pluck at my nipples while my other fingers went to work on my clit, rubbing and circling feverishly, adding to the sensations already building beautifully inside me. I was writhing in heat, hovering on the precipice of blinding bliss. Ian was grunting with every thrust, moving faster as he approached his own release, until, on a guttural cry he urged, \u201cCome! Now!\u201d</p><p>I did. I hurtled over the edge, a breathless cry breaking from my lips as the heat of his seed filled me. He held tight, his cock pulsing inside me as my sex milked him, wringing every last drop of his release from him.</p><p>We stayed locked together until our breathing even out, and only then did he slowly slip out of me, moving to collapse at my side, pulling me into his arms and kissing me sweetly.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he whispered against my lips. \u201cI think you\u2019re gonna be the death of me, but damn, I fucking love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI fucking love you, too,\u201d I whispered back, settling against him when our lips parted, my head pillowed on his shoulder, my thigh draped over his.</p> <p>I let sleep take me under with a smile on my face and Ian softly snoring in my ear.</p><p>I don\u2019t know how long I\u2019d been asleep when I woke up on a low moan, the finger between my thighs manipulating my clit in a halting, yet effective rhythm. The finger pressed harder, circling and circling, pushing me closer and closer to coming. Without warning, it slid inside to press against the wall of my pelvis almost painfully.</p><p>A small yelp broke from my lips and I moved restlessly, trying to alleviate the discomfort. \u201cIan...\u201d</p><p>The finger pressed back inside me, twisting and scraping unnaturally, and it hurt. I cried out and squeezed my thighs together tightly, reaching down to shove away Ian\u2019s arm.</p><p>Ian shifted beside me and let out a moan, but I couldn\u2019t feel him up against me, other than the feel of his hand between my thighs, but since I pushed it away, that was even gone. I gasped as he moaned again, longer and louder this time.</p><p>I sat up and squinted into the darkness, a feeling that something just wasn\u2019t right prickling up my spine.</p><p>\u201cIan?\u201d I said tentatively.</p><p>\u201cGod, Leah...\u201d Ian gasped, and the bed shifted once more. Then, \u201cLeah?\u201d</p><p>I reached over and clicked on the bedside lamp, dread curling sickeningly in my stomach as I stared at the tableau stretched out before me...a real life nightmare. Victoria was crouched over Ian, her lips stretched into a maniacal grin, even as they were wrapped around Ian\u2019s dick, feverishly working him. I watched, detached, as she slid her hand back from where it had been lying near my thigh, feeling even sicker as she brought her fingers to her nose and sniffed, her eyes glistening with unholy glee.</p><p>I watched Ian stiffen, blinking in the light now flooding the room, his face twisting into an expression like nothing I\u2019d ever seen as the situation hit him, but before he could do anything, I felt myself move.</p><p>It all happened in the blink of an eye.</p><p>A scream of rage poured from me as I lunged at Victoria, my hand fisting in her hair and ripping her off of Ian as I tackled her, sending both of us flying off of the bed to land in a heap on the floor.</p><p>Victoria shrieked and scrambled to get away from me, her hand reaching up to scratch at my face, but I slapped it away and jerked her head back viciously once more with the hand that was still gripping her hair.</p><p>My pulse was pounding, the sound of it echoing in my ears, almost drowning out everything else as my arm drew back. It was almost as if I was watching myself, the red haze that had settled over my vision dissipating, dissolving to black as I lost control and let my fist fly...again, and again, and again.</p><p>I was vaguely aware of Ian speaking, of Victoria screaming, and of someone growling and shrieking wildly. What I wasn\u2019t aware of was the fact that it was me growling and shrieking...or that I was doing it while I pummeled Victoria until she was a bloody mess mewling on the carpet of my bedroom floor. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I wasn\u2019t aware, nor did I care, that I was naked astride a crazy woman who\u2019d broken into my house again, this time while we were sleeping. Who\u2019d violated my body, who\u2019d violated Ian...</p><p>Time froze...and then slipped away as hands roughly pulled me off of Victoria.</p><p>There were voices shouting, lights were flashing, and chaos was reigning.</p><p>And all I could do was stare silently down at my hands; one was bloody and bruised...the other held a hank of black strands I\u2019d ripped from Victoria\u2019s head.</p> <p>My vision blurred as tears filled my eyes. I sat, blinking them away, as the last thing Ian had said reverberated in my head.</p><p>He was on the phone. To who, I don\u2019t know.</p><p>But all he said...no, yelled, was, \u201cLeah\u2019s being arrested!\u201d</p><p>Chapter 20</p><p>I heard whispering as I laid on the couch, curled into a ball, staring off into space as I tried to get a little bit of sleep.</p> <p>I\u2019d managed to doze off for a little bit, but couldn\u2019t stay asleep because the phones were ringing off the hook and people were in and out to check on us. Sleeping on the couch in practically the middle of the day isn\u2019t very conducive to peaceful rest, but that\u2019s how it was going to be until I decided if I was going to burn my bed or not.</p><p>I knew what the whisperers were saying\u2014I could hear them, even though they tried to keep their words from reaching my ears.</p><p>\u2018She\u2019s never been like that before, that I know of. I can only imagine she just snapped.\u2019</p><p>\u2018I know...she was the captain of the cheerleading squad, perky as all get out, and everyone loved her in school. She\u2019d never lift a finger to anyone!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Personally, I\u2019m glad she did. I\u2019d have probably killed the bitch...but damn, Leah tried...\u2019</p><p>I couldn\u2019t discern who was saying what because they were whispering, but I was definitely not going to be getting any sleep with them all sitting around talking about me. I huffed and got up, stomping into the kitchen to stand in front of them, tapping my foot and glaring.</p> <p>\u201cI can hear you,\u201d I said, unnecessarily.</p><p>A couple of them had the decency to look ashamed, but most of them just grinned unabashedly.</p><p>\u201cWe thought you were sleeping,\u201d my sister, Emma said.</p><p>\u201cClearly, I\u2019m not,\u201d I replied, being a total smart ass. It\u2019s kind of required in my family.</p><p>I glanced around to see where Ian was, finding him leaning against the counter. Emma was sitting at the table with Chloe, Brandon, and Calland, and Allie was perched on my countertop by the stove.</p><p>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t any of you at work?\u201d I asked, sounding surly.</p><p>\u201cDamn, being arrested made you mean,\u201d Allie quipped, jokingly.</p><p>Chloe\u2019s eyes got huge as she gave Allie an \u2018I-can\u2019t-believe-you-just-said-that\u2019 look and rushed to say, \u201cBecause we\u2019re all off today and wanted to check on you rather than braving the craziness of Black Friday. Are you okay?\u201d Chloe asked, her voice sincere.</p> <p>I walked to Ian and wrapped my arms around his waist, nodding to Chloe in reply. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m good. Just...I mean, did that really happen last night?\u201d</p><p>I felt Ian sigh, his arms tightening around me reflexively. \u201cI wish it didn\u2019t. Goddamn, I wish it didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, not even wanting to think about it, but the memory, still fresh, swam to the forefront.</p><p>Ian had grabbed the phone last night as soon as I lunged at Victoria. He\u2019d called the cops, so that\u2019s who had pulled me off of her, but when they\u2019d walked in, everything had been so crazy that I\u2019d ended up handcuffed and in the back of the cruiser. The cop wouldn\u2019t listen to Ian at first, so Ian had called my brother-in-law, Noah, who\u2019s a detective.</p><p>Noah had rushed over and helped to calm the situation down enough that I was let out and the cuffs were taken off, and instead, Victoria had been loaded up in the ambulance to go treat her injuries, but she was being charged with burglary and sexual battery.</p><p>When we\u2019d gone to bed in such a hurry, neither one of us had set the alarm. The door was locked, but that didn\u2019t matter. She\u2019d broken out the window in the spare bedroom like she did before and crawled into bed with us.</p><p>It made chills crawl over my skin when I thought about that bitch skulking through my house, and the fact that we didn\u2019t hear a thing.</p><p>We\u2019d found out that she was drunk, and it only fueled her delusions. Now she was laid up the hospital under lockdown with a dislocated jaw, broken nose, and two black eyes. Not to mention a nice little bald spot where I\u2019d ripped out her hair.</p><p>And me? I was the proud new owner of a restraining order and a prescription for nerve pills. I hated the fact that she\u2019d be back on the street in no time, out on bond, and probably out for blood and a piece of paper wouldn\u2019t stop her.</p><p>Ian had called Victoria\u2019s parents to let them know where they could find their daughter. They weren\u2019t happy, and when they kept denying that she would do something like that, Ian put the cop on the phone with them. Needless to say, they believed then.</p><p>I burrowed a little closer into Ian for just a brief moment before I moved away from him, heading for my Keurig. I had a feeling that I\u2019d be putting a serious dent in my coffee supply before the day was out.</p><p>I drank two cups of coffee after I hoisted myself up on the counter beside where Ian was leaning as we all talked about what had happened, but then my stomach growled loudly, causing everyone to stare at me.</p><p>\u201cWas that you?\u201d Emma asked.</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m hungry.\u201d</p><p>With the declaration, Ian told me to go get dressed so we could go get some food, and everyone else took their leave, finally, leaving us alone for what seemed like the first time in forever. I ran back to the bedroom and threw on a pair of jeans with my hoodie and shoved my feet into my tennis shoes and we were out the door and on our way to IHOP.</p><p>When we were seated and had ordered, I glanced up to see Ian watching me, concern etched into his handsome features.</p><p>\u201cIan,\u201d I said, softly. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, baby. I\u2019m fine. Are you okay, though?\u201d</p><p>He nodded sharply. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m good, but I just can\u2019t believe...\u201d he cut off on a bark of disbelieving laughter. \u201cYou think you know someone. She\u2019s been around practically my whole life. A nuisance, but...she\u2019s so fucking unbalanced and I had no clue.\u201d</p><p>I reached across the table and took his hand in mine. \u201cIan, you can\u2019t beat yourself up about this. She\u2019ll get what\u2019s coming to her.\u201d</p><p>He sighed, but the conversation waned as the waitress came with our food, turning to more mundane items.</p><p>\u201cAre you excited about the wedding?\u201d Ian asked, cutting another bite of his pancakes.</p><p>\u201cOurs or Chloe and Brandon\u2019s?\u201d I smiled and winked at him.</p><p>\u201cOurs, silly girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I am. I\u2019ve seriously been thinking about eloping, though. Do you think my parents would kill us?\u201d I joked.</p><p>Ian\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cElope? What, like Vegas or something?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged one shoulder as I forked a whip-cream covered bite of blueberry pancake to my mouth. I chewed thoughtfully, then swallowed before answering. \u201cSure. Or Niagara Falls, or Gatlinburg. I just don\u2019t want to be married by Elvis.\u201d</p><p>Ian let out a heavy breath. \u201cSo, are we really discussing this, like you really want to run away and get married?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I giggled and gave a half-hearted shake of my head. \u201cNah. We probably shouldn\u2019t. Chloe would kill me if my parents didn\u2019t. I think she\u2019s more excited about it than we are,\u201d I said on a laugh, but I couldn\u2019t help the wistful tone of my words.</p><p>\u201cYou said we shouldn\u2019t. You didn\u2019t say we couldn\u2019t. Leah, let\u2019s do it. Let\u2019s go get married!\u201d</p><p>I blinked at him in surprise. \u201cSeriously? You\u2019re being serious right now. Really?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, then threw down his napkin and got to his feet. He moved to my side before he dropped to one knee and took my hand in his, staring up into my eyes beseechingly. \u201cLeah, will you run away and marry me?\u201d</p> <p>I grinned, my eyes filling up with tears. \u201cYou\u2019re so goofy,\u201d I said, my voice clogged with emotion. \u201cBut yes, you crazy man, I will run away with you and marry you!\u201d</p><p>I leaned down and kissed him briefly, but only because pure pandemonium reigned around us as people broke into cheering and applause. I glanced around, my cheeks flushing as I found that we were the center of attention for the whole restaurant.</p><p>Ian took it in stride, standing up and pulling me up into his arms as he grinned widely at all the well-wishers.</p><p>I finally got him to sit back down and we finished breakfast, all the while nailing down the details of when we were going. I pulled out my phone and did some checking, but before we left the IHOP, we had a plan: by Christmas, I would be a married woman.</p><p>The next week flew by in a flurry of last minute preparations for Chloe and Brandon\u2019s wedding the following weekend. We had the bachelorette party to look forward to just a day away, on Saturday night, and then it was the seven day countdown until The Big Day. Chloe was bouncing off the walls with excitement, even more so than usual, but who could blame her?</p> <p>I had scheduled to have the Friday before the wedding off so that I could help Chloe out, much to the dismay of my students, but honestly, I think they were more upset that Gerry would be coming home with me on Thursday since I\u2019d be gone on Friday and it was the weekend. I felt bad about it, because the kids absolutely love Gerry, but no way in hell would I leave him at the mercy of a room full of rambunctious kids and a substitute teacher that may not catch someone trying to smuggle him home in their underwear. (Thankfully that hadn\u2019t happened anymore since the last time.)</p><p>I hadn\u2019t taken the Friday off before the bachelorette party, because, let\u2019s face it; I didn\u2019t really need a whole day prep time to get ready to basically get wasted, and I already had all the favor bags packed up and waiting to be passed out.</p><p>Ian was going out with the guys for Brandon\u2019s bachelor party on the same night, but we knew nothing about the details of it. They said that they were keeping it a real secret this time so we didn\u2019t all end up at the same place. Chloe was worried because, of course, my brother got involved in the planning, just like he had been for Luke\u2019s. I put her mind at ease a little bit, though, reminding her that Luke\u2019s hadn\u2019t been too over the top.</p><p>You know...except for Emma and Allie waking up on various kitchen surfaces...</p><p>Anyway. Thankfully, things had been quiet on the crazy stalker front. We\u2019d been told that Victoria was out of the hospital and had been taken downtown to be booked and then released, because her dad was already there with the bond paid so she didn\u2019t have to spend any real time sitting in the jail. We\u2019d also been told that she looked positively dreadful with a swollen jawline and nose, and two sickeningly dark black eyes.</p><p>Those descriptions came via Ian\u2019s Mother, who\u2019d called and \u201capologized\u201d (in her own roundabout way) for the way she tried to throw her son together with that \u201cmadwoman.\u201d Ian had listened, rolling his eyes the whole time, and had ended the call with, \u201cAs soon as you apologize to Leah, then maybe we\u2019ll see you at Christmas.\u201d</p> <p>I wasn\u2019t holding my breath. I had a feeling I\u2019d be dead by the time that happened.</p><p>Ian hadn\u2019t mentioned anything about our engagement to her, nor had he told her that we were going to be married before Christmas down in Tennessee. We\u2019d decided Vegas just wasn\u2019t for us, wedding-wise, and Niagara Falls, while it would be absolutely breathtaking, would just be way too cold (because no way could you go there and not visit the falls), so Gatlinburg it was.</p><p>We\u2019d found the cutest chapel down there that had gorgeous pictures of Christmas weddings they\u2019d performed there. With the decorations and the snow, the place looked like it was straight out of a dream, absolutely breath-taking in its simplistic beauty.</p><p>I\u2019d even managed to sneak away on Wednesday night and found a wedding dress that was perfect. It was basically a simple, white strapless gown, slim fitting at the top, then slightly flaring out at the hips into a full skirt, but it had an overlay of tulle to give it more of that floaty kind of look. The top of the dress had a long-sleeved, fitted overlay of scalloped lace that buttoned up the back, with a wide, boat-neck style that left the tops of my shoulders bare. Add in the white lace, peep-toe bootie shoes with the four inch heels I\u2019d found and I was set.</p><p>What Ian didn\u2019t know, though, was that I couldn\u2019t go wedding dress shopping without my mom. It was hard enough to keep it a secret from my sisters and my best friend, but I think my mom would have had a coronary if I\u2019d gone without her. So, she knew about the wedding, and I\u2019m pretty sure she\u2019s already got a plan in motion to attend.</p><p>I was completely okay with that, especially because it meant my dad could walk me down the aisle. I was pretty sure that, once I told Ian, he\u2019d be okay with it, too. He\u2019s kind of a great guy like that.</p><p>The day of the party dawned bright and beautiful...and super early, due to an overeager bride-to-be pounding on my door at a time no one should be up, especially on a Saturday. When I answered the door, I glared at her, but that didn\u2019t dampen her spirits in any way.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you here at...what time is it?\u201d I growled at her, squinting in the sunlight.</p> <p>She shot me a weird look and glanced at her watch. \u201cIt\u2019s almost nine. What the hell are you doing still sleeping?\u201d</p><p>I yawned. \u201cUh, I don\u2019t know, I was up late last night? But seriously, why are you here so early? I thought we weren\u2019t meeting up until later this evening.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cYeah, well, I thought you and I would go to breakfast and hang out for the day, if that\u2019s okay with you? Did you have something else planned before the party?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I replied, moving aside to let her in. \u201cC\u2019mon in, just give me a sec to get dressed.\u201d</p><p>She practically skipped into the kitchen, calling back her intent to make me a cup of coffee to get me going while I got ready.</p><p>Ian was awake when I walked into the bedroom. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChloe wants to hang out for the day before the party. Are you good with that? We\u2019re gonna go to breakfast, right now. You could probably tag along, if you want. At least to eat...\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, stretching his glorious body under the sheet. \u201cNah, I\u2019m good. I\u2019ll probably head over to see what Brandon\u2019s up to, then. But before you do anything, you need to bring that sexy ass of yours over here and kiss me.\u201d</p><p>I smiled at him before I jumped into bed, landing on my knees beside him. He pulled me into his arms across his body and pressed his lips to mine in a sweet, but totally toe-curling kiss. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I finally broke away on a moan when I heard Chloe yelling for me to hurry up. \u201cDamn you\u2019re good at that,\u201d I sighed. With a quick smack to his chest, I bounded from the bed, scolding, \u201cNow keep your lips to yourself or I\u2019ll never get out of here.\u201d</p><p>He laughed softly behind me, stacking his hands behind his head as he watched me get dressed. And yes, I may have put a little extra wiggle in my hips as I did it...but I heard no complaints.</p><p>When Chloe yelled at me again, I leaned over the side of the bed and kissed Ian quickly, hollering goodbye as I dashed out of the room. Chloe was holding a travel mug in one hand, my purse and keys in the other, urging me out the door.</p><p>\u201cGeez,\u201d I muttered, taking the mug and everything else from her. \u201cI just woke up and you\u2019re rushing me...feel like I\u2019m getting kicked out of my own house!\u201d</p> <p>She pushed me out the door, pulling it shut behind her. \u201cGrumble all you want, but today is going to be awesome. So smile, sunshine!\u201d</p><p>I smirked, walking to the passenger side of her car. \u201cIsn\u2019t that illegal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalling someone sunshine. I thought that was reserved solely for your future husband when speaking to you.\u201d</p><p>She tsked. \u201cSomeone\u2019s grouchy. You just sit back and drink your coffee...leave the rest to me. For now, at least...\u201d</p> <p>Chapter 21</p><p>\u201cChloe, we need to get going! We\u2019re going to be late for your own bachelorette party!\u201d I cried, looking at my phone to check the time. \u201cWe have an hour to get ready and everyone will be showing up!\u201d</p><p>She waved her hand at me, indicating she heard me, but not bothering to move any quicker.</p><p>\u201cI have to find something really cute to wear tonight.\u201d She moved down another aisle, sorting through skirts one by one.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been to five stores today, not counting the liquor store. The outfit you bought at the first place is super hot, so let\u2019s go!\u201d I whined, slumping along behind her. \u201cSeriously, the limo will be picking us up in an hour.\u201d</p><p>She stopped in her tracks. \u201cYou got me a limo?\u201d she asked, incredulously.</p> <p>I blinked at her. \u201cThat\u2019s what got your attention? Not the fact that we\u2019re running late?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA limo?\u201d she repeated.</p><p>\u201cOh my God, Chloe, yes! A limo! How the hell else are we supposed to get around when we\u2019re all drinking? We used one for Emma\u2019s party, why would you think we wouldn\u2019t do the same for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know,\u201d she hedged. \u201cI just figured...I mean it\u2019s not like I\u2019m family or anything. I just...\u201d she shrugged.</p><p>My eyes narrowed at her and she swallowed. \u201cNot family? Chloe, you are family, and if I ever hear you say otherwise, I\u2019m gonna punch you in the face. I\u2019m being totally serious, too.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes filled up with tears and she rushed in to give me a tight hug. \u201cI don\u2019t know how I got so lucky to find such great friends...family,\u201d she hurried to finish when I cleared my throat at her.</p><p>I hugged her back even tighter. \u201cYou deserve it all, sweetie. Now, can we go get ready now? You got me up early to shop and eat food all day, and I was supposed to be getting stuff together for the party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPshaw. You\u2019ve had the bags ready to go for a couple weeks now, so don\u2019t give me that. You just wanted to spend the day in bed with Ian.\u201d</p> <p>I grinned. \u201cIs there something wrong with that?\u201d</p><p>She grinned back. \u201cNo, but I figured since Brandon had to go in to work for a couple hours and I couldn\u2019t spend the day in bed with him, you wouldn\u2019t get to do it with your man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bitch!\u201d I yelled, laughing,</p><p>With that, I was able to finally drag her away from the stores and home to get dolled up for her party night. We\u2019d been gone so long that Ian was on his way out when we got to my house, looking sexy as hell in a fitted button down and tight, ripped jeans.</p><p>I stepped in front of him and tipped my face up for his kiss. \u201cYou look so yummy,\u201d I drawled, winking up at him.</p><p>\u201cYummy?\u201d he snorted, quirking a brow at me.</p><p>\u201cYep. I said yummy. You got a problem with that?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head and smiled fondly. \u201cI suppose not.\u201d</p><p>I kissed him briefly and moved around him, stopping only to smack his ass as I hollered, \u201cNow get your ass outta here! We got girly shit to do!\u201d</p><p>His answering laughter followed him through the kitchen and out into the garage as he left.</p><p>After that, it was nothing but a flurry of activity as both Chloe and I got dressed up to go out on the town to celebrate her upcoming nuptials. Thank God I had two bathrooms, because both of us had to shower, since we\u2019d been here, there, and everywhere all over town that day.</p><p>Forty-five minutes later, my sisters and Allie showed up, and not long after that, the Moms all came. And by the Moms, I meant my mom, Jan; Allie\u2019s mom, Daisy; Chloe\u2019s mom, Sarah; and yes, even Nanny, Allie\u2019s grandma. Needless to say, it was shaping up to be one interesting evening, because Nanny was a last minute edition; the last we\u2019d heard, she\u2019d said she was, \u2018too old to be gadding about town like a harlot.\u2019 Not to mention, we were planning on hitting up the strip club tonight, too, and God only knows how that was gonna go with Nanny riding along.</p><p>But whatever happened, I knew it was gonna be fun.</p><p>I started passing out goody bags, saving all the items I\u2019d gotten for Chloe for last. Before I\u2019d even turned around with Chloe\u2019s Bride-to-Be sash, Nanny had a penis headband on her head, the kind with the two big-ish penises attached to long, floppy springs (I didn\u2019t buy that), a penis shaped shot glass on a beaded necklace looped around her neck (okay, so I did buy that), and she\u2019d opened up her jumbo cock pop and stuck it in her mouth.</p><p>Every single one of us stood there with varying expressions of horror, shock, and humor plastered on our faces as she twirled the oversized, penis-shaped sucker in her mouth before popping it out and saying, \u201cMmm...blueberry. Why can\u2019t all of \u2018em taste that good? I know I\u2019d be more likely to put it in my mouth on a regular basis if they did. Hmm.\u201d</p><p>She cocked her head and stared at me. \u201cYou got any more of those things? Maybe I could just wet it down and rub it along-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNanny!\u201d Allie gasped, and her mom was right there with her, yelling, \u201cMom!\u201d</p><p>My mom just shook her head and grinned while Sarah blinked, not quite used to Nanny\u2019s antics yet.</p><p>Yep. This was definitely gonna be an interesting night.</p><p>Four hours later, we\u2019d had dinner at Manny\u2019s (kind of tradition at this point), we\u2019d been to a couple of bars, including Griff\u2019s, and were just leaving Shimbots, where Emma\u2019s friend, Needa Mann, had bought us all two rounds of shots. She tried to get us to stay for her drag show, but we were on our way to the strip club.</p><p>I\u2019d reserved a table up front, just like Allie had done for Emma, with Chloe seated right by the stage. Her cheeks were flushed with alcohol and happiness, just as I imagined most of our faces were.</p><p>Nanny had tussled a little bit with Allie, who\u2019d just so happened to take the seat across from Chloe, which put her right by the stage, as well. Eh...maybe it wasn\u2019t so much of a tussle as Nanny just told Allie to move her scrawny ass because she was sitting there because she has bad eyesight and needs to be able to see those \u2018dangling wangers\u2019 up close. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Nanny\u2019s kind of a perv. But we love her.</p><p>I barely cracked open my eyelids and slammed them back down, squeezing them tightly shut against the bright sunlight flooding the room.</p><p>I burrowed deeper into the blankets and cuddled closer to the super-soft, sweet smelling pillow under my cheek.</p><p>A rumble of laughter caught my attention, but the words that followed it had my eyes popping open wide.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure if we should be aroused or amused at this point,\u201d a low, sleep laden voice mused.</p><p>My eyes widened even more as they took in the view directly in front of them, which was the t-shirt clad chest of someone decidedly female. The body of which my arm was wrapped around, whose arm was also thrown over my side, so that we were basically sleep-hugging.</p><p>I raised my head, shaking it and blinking as I looked around. I had a head-ache, that\u2019s for sure...and I know things got a little fuzzy last night after the last pink panty dropper I\u2019d had (the cocktail, not the punch), but I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d drank enough to warrant waking up wrapped around my best friend. The kicker of it, though, was when I raised my head, I\u2019d noticed the Chloe and I weren\u2019t alone in the bed.</p><p>In fact, I was staring into the grinning face of Brandon, who was lying on the other side of Chloe...and when I turned my head, it was to see the also-grinning face of Ian, who was lying behind me.</p><p>\u201cUh...\u201d I couldn\u2019t say anything else.</p> <p>Our arms were still around each other when I glanced down to see Chloe staring up at me, frowning.</p><p>Her head jerked back and she squinted, her mouth opening and closing, but nothing came out.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Sunshine,\u201d Brandon said softly behind her.</p><p>I had to laugh when Chloe\u2019s eyes got even bigger and her head spun around in shock. \u201cOh my God! What the fuck is happening here?\u201d she cried, then screeched when she lifted her head to see Ian still lying behind me, his head propped up on his hand.</p><p>\u201cIan? Why...did we...how drunk was I?\u201d she moaned, plopping her head back down on the pillow and trying to cover her face with her hands, gaping at me when she realized that we\u2019d been holding each other.</p><p>Finally, Ian broke the stunned silence permeating the room. \u201cYou two were sleeping when we got home, so we crawled in here with you since every other surface in our house was taken, unless we wanted to pull an Emma and Allie and sleep on the kitchen table and counters.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHuh? I asked, carefully removing my arm from Chloe and sitting up. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Then I snorted, the situation really hitting me. \u201cGuess it\u2019s a good thing we have a king size bed, huh?\u201d</p><p>I grinned at the round of chuckles that brought from my other bedmates.</p><p>We all sat up and Brandon chimed in. \u201cWell, Nanny and Daisy are in the spare bedroom, snoring up a storm. Allie and Emma are sharing the couch, and Chloe\u2019s mom is in the recliner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s my mom?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, your dad picked her up when he was dropping the babies off to my brother and Jacks. And he said to tell you that he loves you, he loves your sisters, and he loves your brother, but the next time you all go out and leave him and Noah with all the kids, he\u2019s killing you all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he volunteered,\u201d I muttered. \u201cBesides, I don\u2019t even have a kid, so why\u2019s he telling you to tell me?\u201d</p><p>Brandon smiled evilly. \u201cHe said to pass it along to each and every one of you, including your mom. But you get to tell her now that I told you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChicken shit,\u201d I coughed out, barely attempting to conceal my words.</p> <p>He nodded solemnly, making me laugh again.</p><p>I stretched, almost knocking Ian off the bed in the process. With a sheepish smile, I apologized and suggested that we get up and go wake everyone else.</p><p>As Brandon walked by me, I reached up and wacked the back of his head, making him wince and yell, \u201cHey! What the hell was that for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was for your comment, you ass!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat comment?\u201d he said, defensively.</p><p>I answered him, deepening my voice comically as I mocked, \u201cI don\u2019t know if we should be amused or aroused right now.\u201d</p><p>Brandon drew back and huffed exaggeratedly. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it was!\u201d I shouted. \u201cDon\u2019t you lie!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not lying,\u201d Brandon stated simply. \u201cYou just didn\u2019t say exactly what I said. I said, I\u2019m not sure if we should be aroused or amused at this point.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes. \u201cSeriously? That\u2019s almost exactly what I just said, just with a couple different words. You\u2019re such a smart ass, Brandon. You know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he replied, smugly.</p><p>I just walked away from him, shaking my head.</p><p>I heard movement in the kitchen and went to investigate while Chloe gently shook my sister\u2019s shoulder, trying to get her up.</p><p>I stopped dead in the doorway to the kitchen, grunting when Ian ran into me from behind.</p><p>Nanny was traipsing around the kitchen in one of Ian\u2019s t-shirts, her bare little chicken legs sticking out the bottom. His shirt covered her from neck to shin, and her hair was sticking straight up in the air, almost like she\u2019d put her finger in a light socket.</p><p>\u201cGood morning!\u201d she crowed, waving at me with the spatula she had clenched in her hands. \u201cI figured I\u2019d get up and make breakfast for you sleepy heads.\u201d She addressed Ian over my shoulder. \u201cI snuck in and grabbed one of your shirts, cause I didn\u2019t know I\u2019d be sleeping over. You guys were so cozy lookin\u2019, all snuggled up in that big ol\u2019 bed.\u201d She looked back at me. \u201cI put my clothes in the washer. Hope you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh...no. Nope, I don\u2019t mind. What time you did you get up, Nanny?\u201d I asked her, entering the kitchen to see what she was cooking.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, it was like five a.m. I tried to get Daisy up to take me home, but that damn woman would only snore and bat me away.\u201d</p><p>I snatched a piece of bacon from a pile and she smacked me with the spatula.</p><p>\u201cYou go on and get everybody in here so we can eat,\u201d she ordered.</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d I answered cheekily, biting into the bacon with a grin.</p><p>Once everyone was at least half-awake, I ushered them into the kitchen where Nanny fed us all heaping plates of pancakes, bacon, and scrambled eggs.</p><p>The talk quickly turned to tales of last night\u2019s activities, including Nanny\u2019s blow by blow account of the \u201cBuff Daddy\u201d that shook his \u201cman meat\u201d in her face so close she\u2019d been afraid he\u2019d poke her eye out.</p><p>\u201cSo, I take it your night wasn\u2019t as wild?\u201d Chloe asked Brandon.</p><p>\u201cNot really. We weren\u2019t out too late because Luke and Jacks promised they\u2019d get the kids from Emma\u2019s dad and Noah, and it just wasn\u2019t as fun without you girls around like last time,\u201d Brandon replied, dryly.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re full of it, too,\u201d Emma answered.</p><p>\u201cRule number one of Bachelor Party Law is you don\u2019t speak of what happens!\u201d Brandon called out, earning him a swat from Chloe. He just grinned, because he knew we knew he was kidding.</p><p>I thought of something then and turned to Allie. \u201cHey, you remember how many life savers you put on that Suck-for-a-Buck shirt you made Chloe?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah, I think I stuck a hundred of them suckers on there. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoly shit! I made a hundred bucks last night?\u201d Chloe exclaimed, looking around for her purse.</p><p>\u201cSweet!\u201d Brandon said. \u201cHow come I didn\u2019t get a suck me off shirt?\u201d</p><p>Chloe sighed as Ian laughed without correcting him, or answering his question.</p> <p>Breakfast was completed with a lot of laughter, good natured ribbing, and lots of Nanny-isms that had us rolling until Daisy decided we\u2019d (she\u2019d) had enough and left with Nanny in tow, clutching her clothes to her chest. She\u2019d kept Ian\u2019s t-shirt and hadn\u2019t bothered asking if he wanted it back.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t long after they left that everyone else started giving their goodbyes and leaving for their respective homes and spouses, until just Ian and I were left.</p><p>We collapsed in a heap on the couch and traded more stories from the night before, especially the one where Jenna tripped and landed face first in a ten foot snowbank in the parking lot of the strip club. It had snowed a good amount two nights before the party, so thank God they\u2019d stacked the piles high or Jenna might not have had such a soft landing. Not that she was feeling much at that time...</p><p>During a lull in the conversation, Ian asked me if his mom had called me.</p><p>I so badly wanted to tell him yes, that she had called and apologized, but I couldn\u2019t lie to him. \u201cNo, baby. She hasn\u2019t called.\u201d</p> <p>He sighed. \u201cShe\u2019s so stubborn. I just thought that maybe with...oh, well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I whispered, laying my lips against his chest in a gentle kiss.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, are you ready for school tomorrow?\u201d he asked, changing the subject.</p><p>I nodded and the conversation turned back to more mundane matters, but both of us skirted the dark thoughts that circled in the back of our minds. I had a feeling we both knew it wasn\u2019t over...not by a long shot.</p><p>The sad thing about it is, neither one of us knew just how right we\u2019d end up being.</p><p>Chapter 22</p> <p>I glanced around the room to make sure none of the kids needed help getting their coats on, smiling at a few of them that bounded over to hug me and tell me goodbye.</p><p>\u201cMiss Jensen, do you hafta take Gerry?\u201d a little voice called, a small hand tugging on my pocket to get my attention.</p><p>I sighed and looked down at Adam. \u201cYes, honey. I\u2019m sorry, but Gerry has to go home with me. I can\u2019t leave him here all by himself all weekend, can I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d the little boy hollered, looking at me with that \u2018duh\u2019 expression that kids are so good at utilizing.</p><p>I sighed, but thankfully the bell rang, signaling it was time to go to the buses.</p><p>When the last kid was gone, I packed up my bag, put Gerry in his \u2018weekend home\u2019, and made sure I\u2019d left the lesson notes for the substitute coming in to cover for me tomorrow. With everything set, I loaded up the car and set off for home, my excitement building more and more for the weekend festivities.</p><p>I made it home before Ian and decided to make a batch of homemade potato soup for dinner. It was almost done by the time Ian walked in the door.</p><p>\u201cHey, baby,\u201d he said as he walked by me. He paused long enough to kiss me hello before he went to clean up.</p> <p>The poor man works himself to death, even in the winter when the construction business usually slows down. Ian, though, generally maps out his projects so that the majority of the building is done in the summer and fall months, so that all the finishing and indoor work can be done during the winter, therefore keeping him busy year-round.</p><p>It\u2019s been even more hectic for him since Jackson had been recommending Ian to all of his clients, and vice versa. It was a pretty beneficial partnership for them both; Jackson would design the buildings or whatever they wanted, and Ian would make it happen. Win-win for everyone, right?</p><p>The week since the bachelorette/bachelor parties had been uneventful, which we were thankful for. Victoria went to her pretrial and, last we heard, she and her attorney were trying to work out a deal with the prosecutor, but her trial wasn\u2019t until the second week of January.</p><p>I\u2019d still managed to keep my own upcoming nuptials a secret, which had been unbelievably difficult, especially because my parents knew. So far, my mom hadn\u2019t blabbed, but since my wedding was next weekend, I was getting more nervous that she\u2019d slip up.</p><p>Turns out, it was my own mouth I had to worry about.</p><p>Early Friday afternoon, the girls and I had all met up to get manicures and pedicures in preparation for the wedding the next day. Once we were done at the salon, we were all due to meet at the church for the rehearsal, and then the rehearsal dinner.</p><p>I was halfway through my pedicure, enjoying the calf and foot massage portion of it, when Emma asked what I was doing next weekend.</p><p>Without thinking, I answered, \u201cGetting married, why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to see if you wanted to keep your niece for...wait, what?\u201d</p><p>I glanced over at her. \u201cWhat, what? You know I\u2019d love to keep her, but I can\u2019t because...\u201d</p><p>It hadn\u2019t registered in my head exactly what I had said just yet. Not until I noticed that Emma, Allie, Chloe, and Sarah, Chloe\u2019s mom were all gawking at me wide-eyed as my words trailed off.</p><p>Oh. Shit.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re getting married?\u201d Emma repeated, cocking her head sideways. \u201cDid I hear you correctly, Leah?\u201d</p><p>I winced. \u201cUh...no?\u201d I tried to backpedal, but...it didn\u2019t work.</p><p>Chloe\u2019s eyes narrowed on me. \u201cAre you and Ian trying to freakin\u2019 elope?\u201d</p><p>I fidgeted, noticing that the whole salon was now staring at me, but none more raptly than the woman who was giving me my pedicure. Or, had been, rather, because she was gazing up at me, her hands frozen in place around my foot, waiting to see what I\u2019d say next, I suppose.</p><p>I blew out a breath and closed my eyes for a second. Without opening them, I rushed to answer. \u201cNo, we\u2019re not trying to elope, we are eloping.\u201d My eyes popped open at the gasps that filled the air around me.</p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t mention it to anyone. We just decided that neither one of us really wanted to have a big wedding, and there\u2019s the cutest little chapel down in Tennessee that\u2019s perfect around Christmas time, especially when it\u2019s been snowing, so...we\u2019re getting married next weekend.\u201d</p><p>Emma looked hurt. \u201cBut what about your family? Mom and Dad? They\u2019re going to be heartbroken.\u201d</p><p>Yikes. And just like that, I had to throw my own parents under the bus. \u201cThey\u2019re coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? They know? Are you kidding me, Leah Nicole Jensen?\u201d she screeched, sitting forward. The tech doing her pedicure scrambled to the side, getting out of her way.</p><p>\u201cYou guys can come,\u201d I threw out softly, hoping to diffuse the situation. Jesus, Ian was going to kill me.</p><p>Allie snorted. \u201cYou can bet your sweet ass that we\u2019ll be there, girlie!\u201d She laughed dryly. \u201cCan\u2019t believe you thought you\u2019d get away with doing that without everyone. Well, guess I know what I\u2019ll be doing Sunday.\u201d</p><p>Emma sat back and let the poor tech get back to her job. She crossed her arms over her chest and grinned smugly. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to tell Jenna and Calland,\u201d she sang. \u201cYou\u2019re in for it.\u201d</p><p>I groaned, and not from the massage that had resumed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I turned my head to look at Chloe, who\u2019d been silent except for her initial outburst.</p><p>She was watching me, hurt still shining in her eyes, but I could also see understanding.</p><p>\u201cMad at me?\u201d I asked, quietly.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo. I understand. I just can\u2019t believe you were gonna do it like my brother did, and cut everybody out of it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, no, no...it wasn\u2019t like that, we weren\u2019t trying to cut everybody out of it, we just, I guess we just didn\u2019t want to make a big deal of it. I\u2019m sorry,\u201d I told her, reaching out across the space between our chairs to grab for her hand.</p><p>She let me take her hand, squeezing my fingers briefly before letting them go. \u201cYou\u2019re just lucky that we were already coming home on Friday from the honeymoon. Now, instead, we\u2019ll just take a detour and be at your wedding, along with everyone else.\u201d She winked and grinned.</p><p>I groaned again. Yep. I was totally dead.</p><p>Finally, the conversation turned away from the topic of my wedding, and as soon as it did, I palmed my phone and texted my mom on the sly.</p><p>Me: Remember how I told you not to tell anyone about the wedding?</p> <p>Mom: I didn\u2019t tell anyone, I swear!</p><p>Me: I know. But I sure as hell blabbed by mistake.</p><p>Mom: Yay! Now I can tell everyone!</p><p>Me: No! Mom, no, not yet. I haven\u2019t even told Ian that I let it out yet...</p><p>Me: Mom?</p><p>Me: Jesus...</p> <p>\u201cRight, Leah?\u201d</p><p>I jerked, sliding my phone back into my pocket as I looked up to see who\u2019d been addressing me. \u201cHmm? What?\u201d</p><p>Chloe gave me a weird look and repeated what she said. \u201cI\u2019m staying with you tonight, because Brandon and I aren\u2019t supposed to see each other. Right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I confirmed, nodding.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d she asked me, still looking at me like I was crazy.</p><p>I waved her off with another nod and changed the subject. \u201cSo, Emma. You heard who our brother dearest is bringing to the wedding as his date?\u201d</p><p>Emma snapped her head around, eyes wide. \u201cNo, who? Tell me, tell me tell me!\u201d</p><p>I sighed, letting my shoulders sag with disappointment. \u201cDamnit! I thought you knew, that\u2019s why I was asking.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, the rat bastard won\u2019t tell me,\u201d she replied, glaring at even the thought of our brother keeping a secret from us.</p><p>Chloe giggled beside me and shot me a knowing smirk.</p><p>I narrowed my eyes at her, growling out, \u201cYou know, don\u2019t you.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a question.</p><p>She only grinned.</p><p>Once all of our fingers and toes were all prettied up for tomorrow, we headed out to the church, still trying to get Chloe to rat out Calland. For the rest of the night, no matter what we did to cajole her, she refused to tell us who Calland was bringing as a date.</p><p>The rehearsal went smoothly, though Sarah had to smack a couple of serial gigglers throughout the process. And no, one of them wasn\u2019t me.</p><p>Okay, so she smacked me once...but she was laughing right along with me!</p><p>The rehearsal dinner was being held at Manny\u2019s in the back party room, and the wine and beer was freely flowing. We toasted the happy couple so many times that Brandon finally held up his hand and stopped Luke\u2019s next one.</p><p>\u201cDude! You guys aren\u2019t gonna have any toasts left for tomorrow!\u201d he cried, laughing.</p><p>Luke winked at him. \u201cTrust me. I have plenty of material left over for tomorrow, brother.\u201d</p><p>For a brief second, Brandon almost looked scared, but then ended up laughing and clutching his brother\u2019s shoulder as Luke continued wishing the couple well.</p><p>I settled back in my seat, nestling into the arm Ian had draped over my shoulders. He was grinning at me, so I just went with it, figuring it\u2019d be a good time to tell him that I let the cat out of the bag. I picked now for two reasons; One, because there was a crowd of witnesses, and two, because he was in a good mood and there was a crowd of witnesses.</p><p>\u201cSo...you love me, right?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, still grinning. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Cause I let it slip about the wedding to the girls today.\u201d</p><p>His grin stayed, but I did see his eye twitch just a little bit in surprise.</p><p>\u201cAre you mad?\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s when his grin slipped away. \u201cMad? How the hell could I be mad? Baby, I would never get mad for you wanting your friends and family to be a part of this. I know we said we wanted to just keep it quiet and not make a big deal of it, but I think it\u2019s gonna work out the way it should. You know?\u201d</p><p>I bit my lip. \u201cBut what about your parents? I know mine were already coming, but I\u2019ve been feeling horrible about you not having anyone there for you.\u201d</p><p>He leaned down and kissed my forehead. \u201cI was already gonna tell them, give them the option of showing up. But don\u2019t get your hopes up. Besides, now I have friends coming.\u201d He gave me a wink and another grin, kissing me briefly on the lips before turning back to the party.</p><p>Chloe caught my eye and raised a brow in question. I smiled in response and settled back against my fianc\u00e9 once more, enjoying the rest of the night with my friends and family.</p><p>Music swelled through the speakers, letting us know that it was time to get into place.</p><p>I dabbed at my eyes once more as I took in the sight of my best friend, standing there in her wedding gown, so beautiful it was breath taking.</p><p>\u201cNo crying,\u201d she scolded, dabbing at her own eyes as tears began to well.</p><p>\u201cNo! No crying!\u201d Emma called frantically, flapping her hands in both of our faces as if to dry our eyes that way. \u201cThat\u2019s our cue to go stand in line, so pull yourselves together this instant!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, Mom,\u201d I told her dryly, dodging her hand when it darted out to slap me, jokingly.</p><p>\u201cYou ready?\u201d I asked Chloe, who nodded, and then turned to Sarah, Chloe\u2019s mom. \u201cAre you?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, flapping her own hands in front of her face to ward off the waterworks that were threatening. She blew Chloe a kiss and strode from the room to get into place and to collect herself a bit.</p><p>As soon as she did, I glanced around the room, feeling my heart swell as Jackson stepped forward, handsome as ever in his tux, and reached for his sister\u2019s hand. He didn\u2019t say anything, just smiled softly and kissed her forehead before motioning for us to precede them out of the room, holding tightly to her hand as he prepared to give her away.</p><p>It was a gorgeous ceremony; everything went smoothly and it couldn\u2019t have been more picture perfect for them, and they didn\u2019t deserve anything less.</p><p>We moved through the pictures and all the normal post-wedding/pre-reception requirements as quickly as possible so we could all get to celebrating. Chloe finally told me and Emma that Calland wasn\u2019t bringing anyone to the wedding with him, but half an hour later while I was sitting at the head table eating my dinner, I realized she\u2019d been lying when I noticed the blond girl sitting next to my brother.</p><p>I nudged Emma, who was seated to my right, jerking my chin at Calland when she looked my way. Her eyes widened and we both glared at Chloe, who wasn\u2019t paying any attention until I elbowed her.</p><p>When she followed the direction of my gaze, she laughed out loud, shaking her head at us and shrugging unapologetically before she turned back to her new husband.</p><p>We didn\u2019t get a chance to corner him until later, once we\u2019d gotten the requisite wedding party dances out of the way, and Chloe and Brandon had cut the cake. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Emma and I finally approached him as he was sitting with Mom and Dad and Jenna and Noah.</p><p>I held out my hand for her to shake as I introduced myself. He hadn\u2019t said anything about dating anyone new, so I figured this must be one of the unfortunate sisters. The bad part? I couldn\u2019t remember which one he was supposed to be with at the moment.</p><p>So I took a chance...and failed miserably, much to the delight of my sisters, and the comical horror of my brother.</p><p>\u201cYou must be Grace! Nice to finally meet you!\u201d</p> <p>She froze with her hand in mine, her eyes narrowing on me. \u201cUm, no. I\u2019m-\u201d</p><p>I cut in again, trying to rectify the situation by letting her know that I did know her name...which I didn\u2019t. \u201cLucy! I\u2019m so sorry...I don\u2019t know where...I...hi!\u201d I finally finished, my cheeks pinched into a wide smile so fantastically fake it might as well have been plastic.</p><p>She pulled her hand from mine and gritted out, \u201cLilly. My name is Lilly.\u201d With teeth still clenched, she turned to Calland (who was glaring at me, by the way) and asked, \u201cWho\u2019s Lucy? And why would she call me Grace? That\u2019s my sister\u2019s name...oh my God. You\u2019re the douchcanoe!\u201d She wailed the last part, then buried her face in her hands before standing abruptly and darting out of the room.</p><p>My eyes found Calland\u2019s and I smiled sheepishly. \u201cWow. She picked up on that pretty quickly, huh? I uh, take it you didn\u2019t tell her about her sister yet?\u201d</p><p>He glared at me and then yelped as my mom swatted him, calling him a cad and man slut while my dad grunted with what sounded like muffled laughter.</p> <p>\u201cJesus, Leah, what a way to ruin my date!\u201d Calland growled. \u201cI hadn\u2019t had a chance to tell her yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m sorry. I honestly thought I had the right name at first. It\u2019s not my fault that you\u2019re a whoredog,\u201d I replied snarkily.</p><p>He sighed. \u201cOh well. The only reason I brought her was because I hadn\u2019t figured out a way to tell her, yet, but that\u2019s not how I wanted it to happen.\u201d He puffed out a breath again and turned, mumbling about making sure she got home okay.</p><p>When he\u2019d walked away, I noticed that the rest of my family was all looking at me and shaking their heads, but their lips were twitching with smiles.</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cMy bad...\u201d</p><p>I drifted away to find the bride and smack her for not warning me.</p> <p>Her response? \u201cHe said he wasn\u2019t bringing a date, but then changed it at the last minute. And I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t warn you, but that\u2019s exactly why I didn\u2019t\u2014I couldn\u2019t remember her name either!\u201d</p><p>The rest of the night passed in a blur of dancing, drinking, and once again toasting the happy couple before we sent them off on their honeymoon in Key West, Florida.</p><p>Once the reception hall was cleaned up (I\u2019d told Chloe I\u2019d make sure it was taken care of so they could leave), Ian and I headed home.</p><p>I\u2019d barely gotten in the door and disarmed the alarm when his hands slide up my body to cup my breasts as he whispered in my ear, \u201cYou look fucking hot in that dress.\u201d</p><p>I whimpered as he tweaked my nipples through the satin bodice, turning my head to nip at his shoulder as I breathed, \u201cI bet I\u2019d look a lot hotter out of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably. But I\u2019ve had this fantasy all night...\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t say another word, but he sure as hell showed me what fantasy he was talking about as he suddenly dropped to his knees and slid under the long skirt of the dress I was wearing. I gasped, reaching for his shoulders to brace myself as he wrenched my panties to the side and buried his face in my already drenched folds, his tongue dragging along my clit with unerring precision that swung me up into near detonation almost immediately.</p><p>He didn\u2019t stop until he\u2019d taken me over the edge twice, literally holding me up with his hands as my knees buckled after the second orgasm, but still not moving until he\u2019d lapped up my release with long, languid strokes that made me writhe against his face.</p> <p>After that, he bent me over the table in the kitchen, tossed my skirt up over my back, and proceeded to fuck me hard and fast until he brought me screaming once more before he rocked up high into me one last time and let go, spending his scalding hot release deep inside my body.</p><p>When we caught our breath, we managed to make it to the bedroom before stripping down and collapsing in a satiated heap on the bed.</p><p>All in all, I\u2019d say it was a pretty good way to end a pretty good day.</p><p>Chapter 23</p><p>It was official. I was Mrs. Leah Nicole Mitchell.</p><p>And it was awesome!</p><p>The wedding was perfect, even though it was a little different than we\u2019d originally planned, but I know neither one of us would change a thing. Shockingly, Ian\u2019s parents had made the trip, showing up to surprise him half an hour before the ceremony.</p><p>Of course, I\u2019d been pretty surprised myself when Margot had walked into the room I was getting dressed in, asking if she could talk to me alone for a minute.</p><p>My mom had taken one look at her and went full on Mama Bear, telling Ian\u2019s mom that she had two minutes and if she made me cry, she\u2019d pay for every single tear that left my eyes.</p><p>Have I mentioned that I love my mom? Cause I totally do...she\u2019s pretty fucking awesome.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t make me cry...though it was the most backhanded apology I\u2019d ever received in my life.</p><p>She\u2019d looked me up and down, sniffing once before grudgingly admitting, \u201cYou look...pretty.\u201d She\u2019d continued on after I\u2019d thanked her, saying, \u201cI\u2019m sorry that I was rude to you and that I threw Victoria up in your face all the time. It\u2019s just that she\u2019s more suited to our Ian and the life he\u2019s been accustomed to, you understand, and you\u2019re...well, you\u2019re not. Really it\u2019s nothing against you, dear, but for what it\u2019s worth, welcome to the family. I suppose.\u201d She\u2019d brushed her hands together then, almost like dusting the apology off of them, straightened the jacket of her very smart, sleekly fitted skirt-suit, and said, briskly, \u201cNow. If you\u2019d find it in your simple little heart to forgive me, I\u2019d appreciate it, and we will expect you both at the annual Christmas party.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d then leaned in and given me one of those perfunctory, barely-touching-almost-hugs and an air kiss before she\u2019d turned on her heel and left the room, leaving me standing dumb-founded and a little confused. But she\u2019d apologized, so that counts for something, right?</p><p>I won\u2019t say that things miraculously turned around one hundred percent, but a tentative truce had been put into play for now. We\u2019ll see how things turn out when we go over there for Christmas next week.</p><p>We had an impromptu reception after the wedding at a restaurant there in Gatlinburg; they\u2019d graciously allowed us to take over a back room where we ate a delicious dinner and then danced along to the soft music playing from the restaurant\u2019s speakers overhead. When we\u2019d left to return to our hotel, we somehow got shuffled around behind everyone and were the last ones out of the door of the restaurant, only to walk out to a shower of bubbles everywhere as our friends and family lined the sidewalk, blowing their little hearts out.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure how Mom had managed to finagle that whole thing, but I wasn\u2019t surprised.</p><p>Ian and I didn\u2019t get to take a honeymoon just yet, because I had to go back to work on Monday after the wedding, but since this Friday starts the holiday break, we had been talking about maybe taking the week between Christmas and New Year to go somewhere, hopefully a place that was warmer and had a lot less snow. You know, like none. But that didn\u2019t mean that we weren\u2019t still acting like we were on our honeymoon...wink wink! </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It\u2019s funny when you think about it, I suppose. Ian and I lived together for almost a year already, and our sex life was already pretty hopping. But there\u2019s something about the whole newlywed thing that increases your sex drive like crazy.</p><p>So the first couple of days after the wedding were almost perfect, even though we were pretty much back to normal life, both of us working during the day, and then spending the nights secluded together, locked in just about every carnal position we could imagine, and then some. We\u2019d sorta-kinda told everyone we were putting a hiatus on friend/family visitation for at least the first week, which got us a few knowing grins and a lot of understanding, especially from Chloe and Brandon who\u2019d adopted the idea for themselves.</p><p>By Wednesday, I was ready for a vacation for sure, not only to spend some uninterrupted time with my husband (I love calling him that!), but because the kids had been on a whole other level since I\u2019d been back. I\u2019d never seen them so wound up!</p><p>I called Ian on the way home from work to see when he\u2019d be home so I could start dinner for us, or to see if he just wanted to pick something up, but he didn\u2019t answer. I was pleasantly surprised to see that his truck was in the driveway when I got home.</p> <p>I pulled in and shut it behind me, entering the house and calling for him as I sat my bag down on the counter. I heard a muffled response coming from the back of the house, so I went to find him.</p><p>And find him I did.</p><p>I pushed open the bedroom door and froze as I saw Victoria standing there, pointing a gun at Ian. I couldn\u2019t move, couldn\u2019t speak, the gravity of the situation dropping like a lead weight in the pit of my stomach as dread curled through my veins.</p><p>Against all odds, I hoped and prayed silently that she hadn\u2019t seen me...but she had.</p><p>Ian was standing, hands out in supplication, unmoving. I could see the fear in his eyes, but I was almost certain that it wasn\u2019t fear for himself; no, he was afraid of what Victoria would do to me.</p> <p>She smirked and cocked her head, not taking her eyes off of Ian as she addressed me. \u201cOh, good. You\u2019re here. I was hoping you\u2019d get to see this part.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVictoria-\u201d Ian roared, stepping forward, to do what, I\u2019m not sure.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t get anywhere.</p><p>She pulled the trigger, and I screamed as blood bloomed on Ian\u2019s chest. He fell backwards onto the carpet, hitting his head on the dresser as he went down. His body was still and silent when he landed, not responding as I screamed his name over and over again.</p><p>I moved to go to him, but found myself blocked as Victoria stood in front of me, her hand shaking as she pointed the handgun at my face. I noticed in that moment that she was perfectly coiffed as usual, but her eyes gave away just how far she\u2019d come unhinged, and I wondered if I would make it out of this alive.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I shouted at her, tears of rage filling my eyes and spilling over as helplessness washed over me. I couldn\u2019t move, couldn\u2019t go to Ian to see if he was alive, because what good would I be to him if I ended up with a bullet in my brain? I cursed myself a dozen times over for the fact that my phone wasn\u2019t in my pocket, but instead, was tucked inside my purse, sitting on the kitchen counter where it would do me no good.</p> <p>Victoria let out a chilling laugh. \u201cWhy? Why not! That\u2019s the real question, LEAH.\u201d</p><p>She backed away from me, motioning with the gun for me to follow. I stepped forward cautiously, following her silent directives until I was standing inside the room, about five feet from Ian.</p><p>\u201cLet me-\u201d I began, taking one more step towards him, but stopped when Victoria screamed, \u201cNO!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to know why, so I\u2019m going to tell you. I mean, like I said before, why not, honestly, because he was pretty much asking for it. Traipsing around with you, waving you under my nose when we ALL know he\u2019s supposed to be WITH ME!\u201d</p><p>Victoria screamed the last part, making me flinch as she swung the gun back into my face, pushing it forward until it rested against my forehead, right between my eyes.</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d She started speaking once more, her voice wavering slightly, but otherwise remaining low and calm. \u201cI\u2019ve decided that I don\u2019t want to go to jail. And I\u2019ve decided that I\u2019m not waiting any longer for him to come to his senses, so, if I can\u2019t have him, neither can you.\u201d</p><p>She said it simply, as if she was reciting the weather to me, or some other mundane topic of conversation.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re crazy,\u201d I bit out through clenched teeth.</p> <p>She tilted her head back and let loose with a loud, long, psycho-killer laugh that confirmed the fact that she\u2019d gone beyond unhinged.</p><p>It was killing me to not be able to check on Ian, so I tried reasoning again, rushing the words this time so she couldn\u2019t cut me off. \u201cPlease, just let me check on him!\u201d I cried out fervently.</p><p>She tucked her chin into her chest and stared at me, her laughter cutting off sharply. \u201cNo. You can\u2019t help him. He\u2019s dead. And you know what? You\u2019ll have to live with that for the rest of your life.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed hard, then breathed a sigh of relief as she pulled the gun away from my head once more. My jaw was aching with the pressure of clenching my teeth so much, but I was so afraid of setting her off...and I couldn\u2019t let myself believe that Ian was gone.</p><p>\u201cYou know, if you\u2019d have just listened when I tried to warn you off, when I told you I was his girlfriend...we wouldn\u2019t be in this predicament, now would we? But you didn\u2019t listen. Oh! Thank you, by the way. I forgot to tell you how much I enjoyed using your little love toys while Ian watched me on video. He really enjoyed the pictures, too. Did he tell you that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou disgusted him, Victoria.\u201d The words were out before I could stop them.</p><p>She paused, turning her head sideways as she studied me, a small smile playing about her lips. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to distract me. And you\u2019re lying.\u201d She smirked. \u201cI wasn\u2019t disgusting to him when I had my lips wrapped around his dick, sucking him off.\u201d</p><p>A low growl sounded through the room, and it took me a second to realize it was coming from me.</p><p>Victoria sighed and rolled her eyes. \u201cOh, don\u2019t act like you didn\u2019t enjoy that night, too. See how nice I can be? I was willing to share him with you, went as far as shoving my fingers up your greedy little cunt to keep you happy, but did you appreciate that fact? No! No, you didn\u2019t, you stupid little bitch!\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d reverted back to screaming at me, her face blood red, and her eyes squeezed shut.</p><p>I took that opportunity to glance at Ian, trying against all hope to see some sort of movement from him, but that was a mistake.</p><p>While I was distracted, Victoria struck out with the hand still clutching the gun, slamming it against the side of my head. It was a glancing blow, catching me more on my forehead just above my temple, but as warm wetness started trickling down my face, I knew my skin had split.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say you could look at him, you fucking bitch!\u201d</p><p>Victoria was breathing hard, the sound sawing in and out loudly in the silence. My head was pounding, and I was blinking quickly, trying to keep blood out of my eye.</p><p>She stepped away from me again, keeping me in her sights as she lowered herself on to my bed, scooting into the center of it and arranging herself artfully. \u201cNow. Here\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen. Since you came home and caught us,\u201d she waved back and forth between herself and Ian, \u201cyou shot him in a jealous rage. Then, you shot me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I gaped at her. Surely she saw the gaping holes in her plan...but if not, I sure as hell wasn\u2019t going to tell her. I shook my head in denial, but kept quiet.</p><p>\u201cGet over here, Leah, and take the gun,\u201d she yelled.</p><p>I shook my head again, my body trembling from trying to hold myself so still for so long.</p><p>Victoria lunged to her knees, anger painting her face a dull red as she screamed, \u201cTake this fucking gun right now and fucking shoot me! DO IT!\u201d</p> <p>A high-pitched, half-delirious squeal of laughter formed on my lips, bubbling free at the ludicrous reality that a woman was sitting in front of me, begging me to shoot her. \u201cYou\u2019re insane, Victoria. You\u2019re seriously fucking insane.\u201d</p><p>She brandished the gun again, only this time, she was using it to gesture with. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to do what I say,\u201d she whined, her eyes wide, lips pouting, poking the barrel of the weapon into her chest to emphasize her words. She sat like that for a minute and then said, softly, \u201cI\u2019ll just have to shoot you instead. I mean, you were coming at me. You were going to kill me, so I had to protect myself. I had to get the gun from you. Just such a shame that you died in the process.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVictoria...\u201d I breathed, imploring her almost wordlessly not to do this.</p><p>A low moan had us both looking toward the floor where Ian was lying, still unmoving. But that sound gave me hope that he was alive, that she hadn\u2019t hit anything vital, and that maybe, if this ended soon enough, he wouldn\u2019t bleed to death before I managed to get some help.</p><p>I whispered Ian\u2019s name, tears once more flooding my eyes as I saw his fingers twitch, and finally saw his chest moving slightly with his breathing, something I\u2019d been unable to detect before now.</p> <p>\u201cShut up, bitch!\u201d</p><p>Her words brought my attention back to Victoria, who was now kneeling on the end of the bed, having moved closer to look at Ian.</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s perfect,\u201d she purred, giving me a sly, secretive smile. \u201cNow he doesn\u2019t have to die, and he and I will live happily ever after with you out of the way.\u201d</p><p>She once again used the gun as an extension of her words, pointing it at different parts of my body to punctuate every word as she mused, \u201cWhere. Should. I. Shoot. You?\u201d</p><p>Another groan sounded from Ian, but Victoria ignored it, pressing the barrel of the gun under her chin in place of her hand or finger as she adopted an exaggerated thinking pose.</p><p>Two things happened then, both of them seemingly in slow motion.</p> <p>A loud bang sounded outside, startling me...</p><p>And it also startled Victoria.</p><p>The difference? I didn\u2019t happen to be holding a gun pressed to the bottom of my chin when I jerked.</p><p>But she did.</p><p>Chapter 24</p><p>Two Months Later</p><p>I pressed tighter against my husband, reveling in the feel of him wrapped around me as we danced to Angel Eyes by The Jeff Healy Band in the middle of the dance floor at Griff\u2019s.</p><p>Funny how things come full circle, sometimes, isn\u2019t it? I rubbed my cheek against his chest as I remembered the moment I knew that this man would become my life; right here in this bar, on this dance floor, dancing to this song on the night we met.</p> <p>Two months ago, I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d get a chance to talk with my husband ever again, let alone dance with him, because he\u2019d been shot by a psycho bitch with a stalker complex. Luckily, it had hit him in the upper chest/shoulder area, missing his vital organs, and just barely missing his subclavian artery.</p><p>Thank God he\u2019d survived, but if that artery would have been hit, he wouldn\u2019t have. The wound had healed nicely, but we both still have nightmares every now and then about that night.</p><p>The loud bang that had startled us turned out to be a car accident that had happened almost right in front of my house. The neighbor\u2019s dog had gotten loose and ran into the street, causing a car coming up the road to swerve to avoid it...only they\u2019d ended up rear-ending a parked car instead. They weren\u2019t hurt, thank God, but I could have kissed them regardless for being the catalyst that ended the nightmare we\u2019d been trapped in that day.</p><p>Victoria wasn\u2019t so lucky, though. When she\u2019d jerked, her finger had tightened on the trigger and I\u2019d watched in horror as she died, right there on my bed. I\u2019d been frozen to the spot, tears tracking down my face as my brain tried to process what had happened, those few, crystallized seconds burned into my memory forever.</p><p>Another groan from Ian had broken my stupor and I\u2019d rushed to him, dropping to my knees at his side and frantically trying to assess his wounds to see just where he was shot. There was so much blood, but that was to be expected, I supposed, since he\u2019d just been lying there, bleeding as everything played out.</p><p>It seemed like those moments had stretched out into hours, a never ending loop of horror that was actually only fifteen minutes. Fifteen of the longest minutes of my life.</p><p>As soon as I\u2019d checked Ian, I\u2019d ran to get the phone, calling for help as I grabbed towels to press to his chest to stop the bleeding, as we waited for help. We left the house that night and only went back to pack up most of our stuff.</p><p>There was no way we were going to stay in that house with the ghosts that would haunt it forever now.</p><p>We\u2019d put our belongings in storage and had been staying at Emma and Luke\u2019s house, but thankfully, we\u2019d managed to find a new place that we fell in love with a couple weeks ago. If everything went well, we\u2019d be closing on it next month.</p><p>Christmas and New Year were spent with our closest friends and family that, surprisingly (or maybe not so surprisingly), included Ian\u2019s parents. They\u2019d received a wake-up call for sure when they\u2019d come close to losing their only son. Since then, I\u2019d gotten a very heart-felt apology from them both and they\u2019d made it a point to meet us for dinner at least once every two weeks, if not more often. I was still a little cautious around Margot, but she\u2019d stopped the snarky comments altogether and seemed to genuinely want to get to know me better.</p><p>They don\u2019t talk to or see the Jones\u2019 anymore. No one does. They buried their daughter and moved to their home in France, leaving everything behind. I didn\u2019t blame them; I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be able to bear the whispers behind my back. I also didn\u2019t blame them for what Victoria had done. I think they truly loved their daughter enough to look past her faults, but it doesn\u2019t change the fact that there was so much more going on with that girl that they should have seen.</p><p>Things have slowly gotten back to normal, though. Well, as normal as our family and friends could be...</p><p>Shaking myself back to the present, I tipped my head back to see Ian staring down at me.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d he murmured, smiling softly.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I said, smiling back.</p><p>\u201cGood?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cYep. Perfect,\u201d I replied, going up on tip-toe to kiss him.</p><p>We finished out the song and returned to the table where Chloe and Brandon were sitting with Allie and Jacks. Liam was with his Grandma Sarah, who was still happily seeing the doctor friend she\u2019d met. Emma and Luke had stayed home tonight, because Everly had been sick, and Jenna and Noah said they were too worn out to go anywhere.</p><p>Calland had met up with us, but his eye had already been caught by an absolutely stunning, tattooed redhead standing at the bar, looking over everyone with a bored expression, but there was a sharpness in her eyes that said she didn\u2019t miss much. I\u2019d never seen her before, but I had a feeling my brother would not win with that one. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I slid into the booth beside Chloe, and Ian followed me in just as the waitress stopped by with new drinks for us. The guys were drinking beer, and Chloe and I were sharing a pitcher of mango margaritas, but I hadn\u2019t been able to figure out what Allie was drinking, since she\u2019d ordered it at the bar when they came in.</p><p>\u201cAllie, what are you drinking tonight?\u201d I asked, curiously eyeballing her glass.</p><p>She blushed and glanced up at Jacks, who just smiled and gave a small nod.</p><p>\u201cWater,\u201d she answered, her eyes sparkling.</p> <p>Chloe stared at her quizzically, then grinned as understanding dawned; I knew that my expression matched hers, our faces lighting up even more as Allie nodded and confirmed our thoughts.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re pregnant again!\u201d she crowed, clasping her hands together over her belly lovingly.</p><p>Congratulations were flying and toasts were made as the joyous news was yelled throughout the bar to strangers, acquaintances, and friends alike.</p><p>We laughed as Allie nudged Jackson and said, \u201cGood thing we told the parents and Emma earlier or we\u2019d be in trouble, huh.\u201d</p><p>He just grinned and nodded before leaning in and kissing the tip of her nose.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t too long after that we all decided to call it an evening. As I stood to leave, I looked around for my brother, not seeing him anywhere.</p><p>\u201cIan, I\u2019m gonna look for Calland while you pull the car up, okay? I don\u2019t want to just run off on him.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, pecking my lips as he moved past me after saying goodbye to everyone. I hugged them all and called goodbye as they walked out, reassuring them that I was just going to find Calland to let him know we were leaving.</p><p>I finally found him coming back from the bathroom, making a beeline for the empty stool on the other side of the redhead, but I intercepted him.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up, sis?\u201d he asked, keeping his eyes trained on his prize.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re heading out. Figured I\u2019d tell you, but I guess you\u2019re a little occupied at the moment, huh?\u201d</p> <p>He glanced at me, grinning shamelessly. \u201cI\u2019d like to be occupied, but she\u2019s got that fuck off vibe that keeps everyone at a safe distance so they don\u2019t end up getting throat punched.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re hopeless, you know that, Calland?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup. So, I heard the news. New rugrat gonna be coming along, right?\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cYep. They\u2019re so happy...and I\u2019m happy for them. I love babies!\u201d</p><p>He nudged me. \u201cThen maybe you should get to working on one of your own.\u201d</p><p>I nudged him back. \u201cYou never know; maybe we\u2019re already working on it.\u201d</p><p>His eyes met mine, his brows raised in surprise and happiness. \u201cAre you? Really?\u201d</p><p>I winked, laughing as I replied, \u201cWe\u2019re practicing working on it. All the time. Like four times a day.\u201d</p> <p>His face melted into a grimace and he shoved me gently. \u201cGo on with that shit, you sicko. I don\u2019t need to hear about your sex life!\u201d</p><p>\u201cPayback\u2019s a bitch, isn\u2019t it, brother dearest?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, chuckling softly. \u201cNow go on, get out of here. I\u2019ve got work to do.\u201d</p><p>It was my turn to shake my head, following his gaze to the redhead once more. \u201cI think maybe you should leave well enough alone, big brother. I think that one bites, and she\u2019d likely hand your balls to you on a silver platter.\u201d I paused. \u201cYou know what? Nevermind. That just might be what you need to get your head outta your ass and find a good girl. Leave the Fluffy, Muffy, and Huffy to the younger ones.\u201d</p><p>He narrowed his eyes at me. \u201cBitch,\u201d he growled, but I knew he was playing.</p><p>\u201cAss,\u201d I replied, patting him on the shoulder and waving as I walked away.</p><p>I thought about bringing Ian back in and hanging around to see how this all played out. I had a feeling it was about to get interesting...</p><p>But I decided against it. I had a sexy, tattooed husband sitting outside waiting on me.</p><p>And we had more practicing to do.</p><p>Calland</p><p>I waved goodbye to my sister and sauntered over to the bar, leaning against it beside the redhead I\u2019d been eyeing all night.</p><p>She\u2019s fucking gorgeous, pierced and inked up, and had legs for days, but the prickly vibes she was throwing off was keeping most of the fuckwads around here away.</p><p>Not me, though. I had to talk to her, just once, to try and break past that wall she had up and get her to smile. Even if I crashed and burned like Leah thought was gonna happen.</p><p>She was steadfastly ignoring me, but I still gave it a shot.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re new in town. What\u2019s a beautiful girl like you doing in a backwoods place like this?\u201d</p><p>Her lips curled into a smirk as she turned to face me. \u201cReally? That\u2019s what you\u2019re leading with?\u201d she snorted.</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cNot leading with anything, just making conversation. I didn\u2019t say anything that wasn\u2019t true. You are beautiful...but you know that. And you\u2019re definitely new in town, cause I\u2019d remember that face.\u201d</p><p>She tilted her head, studying me for a brief moment before opening her mouth and dropping me. \u201cOkay, stud. You\u2019re a good looking guy. Used to getting what you want, right? So, right now, you\u2019re expecting me to bat my lashes, twist my hair, giggle, and blindly follow you home for a brainless night of mediocre sex,\u201d she said in disgust. \u201cAm I close?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOuch. Mediocre? Not close at all. Mind-blowing, maybe,\u201d I couldn\u2019t help but retort, regretting it almost as soon as the words left my lips.</p><p>She rolled her eyes and twisted back around, blowing me off.</p><p>I tried again. \u201cYou\u2019ve got me all wrong, Red. I didn\u2019t have you pegged for the simpering, giggly girl. You\u2019re all woman, and that\u2019s clear to see, but damn. My bad for attempting to make conversation with you.\u201d I stood straight, intending to walk away, stopping only when I felt a soft, small hand grab my wrist.</p><p>I looked at her, one eyebrow raised in question, not saying anything.</p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t mean to be rude, but I\u2019m here looking for someone and I don\u2019t have time to mess around with every hot Tom, Dick, or Harry that glances my way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood thing my name is Calland, then,\u201d I said, winking at her.</p><p>Her lips twitched but she never let the smile come, just shook her head.</p><p>But that lip twitch left me determined to see her smile.</p><p>I extended my hand to her and she took it automatically, shaking it as I winked at her and said, \u201cHi. I\u2019m Calland. Come here often?\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
