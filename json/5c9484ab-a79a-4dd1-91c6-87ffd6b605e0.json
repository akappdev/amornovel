But he was determined to have Win as his wife, no matter what obstacles had to be overcome.</p> <p>\u201cNothing is going to stop this wedding,\u201d he told her as he came into her bedroom one evening before the ceremony. \u201cI\u2019m going to marry you if lightning strikes the church. I\u2019m going to marry you if the entire village of Stony Cross is flooded, or the pastor is drunk, or animals stampede through the ceremony.\u201d</p><p>Smiling quizzically, Win turned the lamp low and came to him in her dressing gown. \u201cI gather you\u2019re expecting something to go wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. It\u2019s a Hathaway wedding.\u201d</p><p>Despite his grumbling, Kev felt his pulse escalate to a fast, heavy clamor as Win approached. She looked angelic, her slender body wrapped in white lace and ruffled silk, her light blonde hair cascading in loose shimmering waves. He adored her with an intensity that approached worship . . . and yet she was all woman to him. His woman.</p><p>Something about her had always cut past his defenses and reached his very soul.</p> <p>Reaching around his neck, Win let her fingers play gently in the cropped hair at his nape. Her body pressed all along his, the feminine curves molding sweetly against him. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He let his lips play in the glinting wisps of hair at her temple. \u201cBeatrix found a wounded owl this morning and brought it to the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoor thing. If anyone could make it well, it would be Beatrix.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re missing the point,\u201d Kev said, smiling reluctantly. \u201cOwls are bad luck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe in bad luck.\u201d Standing on her toes, Win brushed the tip of her nose playfully against his.</p><p>Kev felt compelled to make his case. \u201cI also caught a glimpse of your wedding dress while Amelia was sewing something on it in the parlor.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, but I wasn\u2019t in the dress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill bad luck,\u201d he insisted. \u201cAnd then the dairymaid told me some gadje poem about the best day to marry. Saturday isn\u2019t one of them.\u201d Gadje was the term Gypsies used to refer to outsiders.</p><p>\u201cYes, I know the poem. Monday for health, Tuesday for wealth, Wednesday\u2019s the best of all. Thursday brings crosses, and Friday losses, but Saturday no luck at all.\u201d</p><p>Kev gave her a quick frown. \u201cYou knew that poem, and you still chose a Saturday for the wedding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe almanac said it would be a fine day,\u201d Win protested. \u201cBesides, I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d put any stock in a gadje superstition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do when it\u2019s about our wedding!\u201d</p><p>She had the nerve to grin. \u201cYou\u2019re far too superstitious.\u201d She went to stand by the bed. Sending him a provocative glance, she untied the sash of her dressing gown and began on the row of tiny buttons along the front. \u201cI\u2019m yours already, Kev. It doesn\u2019t matter what goes wrong at the wedding . . . the ceremony is a mere formality. We\u2019ve made our vows and consummated them . . . or did I only imagine that you stole me right out of this bed not long ago?\u201d</p><p>The reminder caught Kev\u2019s attention, as she had intended.</p> <p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t protest,\u201d he pointed out, watching as she unfastened one tiny button, and another. He went instantly hard as he caught a glimpse of her breast.</p><p>\u201cOf course I didn\u2019t. I\u2019d been trying to get you to ravish me for years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always wanted you.\u201d His voice was thick and low.</p><p>\u201cI knew. But you were so stubborn.\u201d Little by little the front of the dressing gown fell open, revealing, soft, pale skin.</p><p>As Win saw his reaction to the display, a glint of satisfaction appeared in her eyes before she could conceal it.</p><p>Kev was well aware that Win managed him adeptly in her own soft, sweet way.</p><p>Being a Romany male, he probably should have resented that. But he was too enchanted by her shy seduction to object. He moved toward her, reaching out to ease the lace and silk from her shoulders. \u201cIn my heart you\u2019re already my wife,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019ll have no peace until you\u2019re legally mine. No man has ever been so eager for his wedding day.\u201d His lashes half-lowered as he felt her tender mouth on the side of his neck.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m eager for the wedding night,\u201d Win told him breathlessly.</p><p>A sound of amusement rustled in his chest. \u201cWhy? Do you think I have something out of the ordinary planned for you?\u201d A grin tugged at his lips as he felt her nod against his throat. \u201cPerhaps I do,\u201d he murmured. \u201cThere are things I haven\u2019t shown you yet.\u201d</p><p>Win drew back to give a look of wide-eyed surprise. He held her gaze, smiling slightly as he saw the color rise in her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t done everything?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Kev shook his head.</p><p>Her flush deepened, and she gave a disconcerted laugh. \u201cWell, now I\u2019m cross with you. I\u2019ve been feeling very worldly and experienced, and now you tell me that I\u2019m still a novice?\u201d</p><p>His smile lingered. \u201cI\u2019ll teach you more when you\u2019re ready.\u201d</p><p>The moment was delicious. The silence between them was warm and provocative, their breaths mingling, her naked body clasped carefully against his clothed one.</p><p>\u201cTeach me now,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cGiving orders?\u201d Kev chided, his dark eyes sparkling. \u201cA Romany wife must learn to obey her husband. Perhaps I should have mentioned earlier . . . the Rom have a special custom for the wedding night.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDo they?\u201d She jumped a little as his warm hand slid over the curves of her bottom.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cThe husband takes one of the wife\u2019s shoes and sets it on the floor, on his side of the bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He squeezed her bottom meaningfully. \u201cSo she\u2019ll know who is master.\u201d</p> <p>Win regarded him with a flirting grin. \u201cWe\u2019ll see about that. I\u2019m very fond of my shoes, and I won\u2019t surrender them easily.\u201d</p><p>His mouth passed gently over hers, and he tasted her with the tip of his tongue. \u201cYou\u2019ll surrender.\u201d</p><p>Win pulled away with a muffled laugh. Leaning back against the edge of the mattress, she watched in fascination as Kev stripped off his shirt. Her gaze traveled over his muscled torso, the gleam of his smooth, hairless chest. Her breath quickened in excitement as he came to her.</p><p>Clenching one hand into the spill of her long hair, Kev carefully eased her head back to expose her throat. And he dragged his mouth along her neck, using his tongue, while his other hand went between her thighs. He caressed her, played with her, until he could slip two fingers easily inside. His mouth covered hers, his tongue sinking deep, and she shivered in arousal at the simultaneous penetrations.</p><p>\u201cKev,\u201d she said in an unsteady whisper, her hands gripping his bare back, \u201cLove me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI do,\u201d he whispered back, his fingers deep and coaxing inside her. \u201cYou\u2019re my soulmate, my twin flame. I knew it the first time I saw you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo did I,\u201d she said, trembling.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re never out of my thoughts . . . I want you always . . . \u201d</p><p>Withdrawing his gentle touch, he lowered her to the bed. As he lay beside her, he smoothed his palm along her front, fingertips sensitive to every quiver of her nerves. Bending over her br**sts, he caught a rosy tip and drew his tongue against the tautness, while his hands moved over her in light erotic paths.</p><p>She arched upward helplessly as his mouth traversed her body, the soft secret places where sensation converged. He filled her powerfully, following the pulse and heat of her, riding every sweet undulation. And he reached the summit with her, glorying in their shared pleasure . . . surrendering to his own endless passion for her.</p><p>Chapter Two</p> <p>\u201cKeep her immobile,\u201d Cam murmured to Beatrix as they bent over the injured owl. \u201cIf she gets loose, she\u2019ll damage herself, and probably us as well. Those talons are like knives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wants to hold something,\u201d Beatrix said quietly, glancing at the bird\u2019s clutching talons. \u201cCan you find us a stick, Amelia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCertainly.\u201d Amelia hurried from the parlor to the kitchen, found a wooden spoon, and brought it back to her husband and sister. They were crouched on the floor over the straining form of a tawny owl. Beatrix had found the wounded bird during one of her daily rambles through the wood. The owl\u2019s wing was broken, and Cam was attempting to set and splint it.</p><p>Beatrix had wrapped the tubby little owl in a blanket. Tearing her concerned gaze from the bird, she reached for the wooden spoon that Amelia had brought, and carefully pushed the handle against the owl\u2019s talons. The spoon was immediately accepted and held. Amelia could have sworn the owl actually looked relieved.</p><p>Not for the first time she marveled at Beatrix\u2019s empathy with animals, though whether that was a blessing or a curse remained to be seen. Setting aside her worry for the moment, Amelia took a nearby chair and watched her husband.</p><p>Three years earlier Amelia had stunned the family\u2014and herself--by marrying Cam Rohan, a Rom from London, after knowing him only a matter of weeks. Until then she had prided herself on being a sensible woman who had never understood the phrase \u201cswept off her feet.\u201d</p><p>But that was exactly what Cam had done. Handsome, exotic, sensual, he was not the kind of man one might have expected Amelia to wed. In fact, Amelia had never expected to wed at all. After the deaths of her parents she had reconciled herself to taking care of her four siblings; Leo, Win, Poppy and Beatrix. But then Cam had entered her life, understanding her secret dreams and needs with unnerving acuity. He had seduced her, mind, body and soul.</p><p>And he had stayed, explaining that every once in a while, some Gypsy found his atchen-tan, his stopping-place. To Cam, love and family meant far more than his freedom. Gradually much of the burden of taking care of the Hathaways had shifted to Cam\u2019s strong shoulders.</p> <p>As Cam tended the owl, carefully folding a splint around the wing, a breeze came through the windows and toyed with the locks of shining black hair on his forehead. Amelia gazed at him possessively, appreciating the way his thin linen shirt clung to the powerful lines of his back. He was a ridiculously beautiful man, with his amber eyes and flashing smile. And how patient he was, his hands deft and graceful as he wrapped the splinted wing against the owl\u2019s body.</p><p>\u201cKew-wick,\u201d the bird fretted and protested. \u201cKew-wick! \u201d</p><p>Cam said something in Romany, the words soft and soothing, and the owl quieted. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you take her to the barn now?\u201d Cam suggested to Beatrix. \u201cShe\u2019ll want to rest in her nest box.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould I offer her water?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might try it, but she won\u2019t want much. Owls usually draw their moisture from their prey. Which reminds me\u2014you\u2019d better find some mice for her.\u201d</p><p>Beatrix made a face, hating the necessity of feeding live mice to the bird. \u201cI\u2019ll see if I can get Dodger to catch some.\u201d She drew on a makeshift gauntlet\u2014a leather glove borrowed from Merripen\u2014and together she and Cam unwrapped the owl and coaxed her to perch on Beatrix\u2019s arm. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBeatrix,\u201d Amelia said, \u201cbefore you go, might I have a word with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, have I done something?\u201d Beatrix gave her a cheerfully quizzical glance, her blue eyes nearly as round as the owl\u2019s.</p><p>She was a striking girl of nineteen, not classically beautiful as Win and Poppy were, but she possessed a sweet, coltish grace and a winsome appeal that charmed everyone who met her. Most irresistible of all, she had a smile that flashed out of nowhere, textured with sly irreverence. Beatrix was radiant, open, and as curious as her pet ferret Dodger.</p><p>What kind of man would ever be right for Beatrix? A young one, perhaps.</p> <p>Someone who would not crush her exuberant nature. But might Beatrix be better off with someone older? Someone who would curb her impulsiveness and protect her?</p><p>Ironically, during the two seasons that Beatrix and Poppy had spent in London, Beatrix had been infinitely more sought-after. And Beatrix couldn\u2019t have cared less about finding someone to marry. Whereas poor Poppy, who wanted desperately to have her own family, had had very little success so far.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s because Poppy becomes nervous around gentlemen, and she starts talking very fast,\u201d Beatrix had confided to Amelia.</p><p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t feel nervous around them?\u201d Amelia had asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, no. I merely ask questions to keep them talking, and they seem pleased with that.\u201d</p> <p>Bringing her mind to the present, Amelia smiled at her youngest sister, who was in her usual state of disarray. The hems of Beatrix\u2019s skirts were muddy, and her dark brown hair was falling from its pins, and there was a smudge at the tip of her adorable nose.</p><p>\u201cNo, you haven\u2019t done anything,\u201d Amelia said. \u201cI merely wanted to mention that much of the local gentry will be attending Win\u2019s wedding next week.\u201d A wry smile twisted her face as she added, \u201cAnd it has been impressed on me by some well-meaning friends that there will be eligible gentlemen present.\u201d</p><p>Beatrix\u2019s expression was similar to the one she had worn when the live mice were mentioned. \u201cPoppy can have them. She wants to get married much more than I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but . . . Bea . . . you\u2019re of the appropriate age as well, and . . .\u201d Amelia paused, searching earnestly for words. \u201cWhat I\u2019m asking is that you let yourself be open to the possibility of liking one of these gentlemen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to marry me off?\u201d Beatrix asked blankly.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not that . . . it\u2019s only that I see how absorbed you are in your creatures. You\u2019re intent on helping them and caring for them to the exclusion of all else. But the opportunities you have now won\u2019t always be available. Most young women don\u2019t have more than three seasons in London before they\u2019re considered . . .\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOn the shelf?\u201d Beatrix suggested.</p><p>The owl looked expectantly from Beatrix to Amelia, its round face mildly concerned.</p><p>Amelia grimaced. \u201cI detest that expression. It makes an unmarried girl sound like a book no one\u2019s reading.\u201d</p><p>Beatrix shrugged. \u201cI\u2019d rather be on the shelf than marry any of the gentlemen I\u2019ve met so far.\u201d She looked genuinely contrite. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Amelia. I know you\u2019re giving me practical advice, as always. Truly, I\u2019ve tried to like the gentlemen I\u2019ve met, but none of them is very interesting or appealing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps one of them has hidden qualities,\u201d Amelia said, making room for Cam as he sat beside her. \u201cI wonder, Bea, if you might try to view gentlemen with the same sympathetic interest that you have for animals? In some regards, they\u2019re not all that different. What I mean is\u2014\u201d She broke off and scowled at Cam, who had dissolved into helpless laughter. \u201cOh, hush, you know what I\u2019m trying to say!\u201d</p><p>Beatrix was trying unsuccessfully to hide a grin. \u201cI understand, Amelia. I promise that from now on, I\u2019ll try to think of eligible gentlemen as an interesting new species.\u201d</p><p>After her younger sister had left, Amelia buried her face in her hands. A groan escaped through her fingers. \u201cWhat are we to do with her?\u201d</p><p>Cam smiled and pulled her close. He spoke in a soothing tone not unlike the one he had used for the tawny owl. \u201cBe at ease, monisha. No ordinary man will do for Beatrix. We\u2019ll have to let him appear in his own time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s taking too long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeatrix is only nineteen, love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that. But she needs someone, Cam. Someone just for her. There\u2019s a restlessness in her, a sense of aloneness . . . whatever it is, it makes her want to draw away from the family. She spends far too much time rambling alone in the wood. Even after Miss Mark\u2019s etiquette instructions, Beatrix is still only half-civilized.\u201d</p><p>Cam drew back to look at her, his gaze steady and thoughtful. \u201cHaving her marry the wrong person won\u2019t solve the problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, and I certainly don\u2019t want that. It\u2019s just that if the right man does come along, Beatrix will be so busy trimming alpaca hooves or rescuing orphaned badgers that she won\u2019t notice him.\u201d</p><p>Cam smiled. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t have an alpaca.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet.\u201d Amelia gave a rueful sigh. \u201cI\u2019m afraid this obsession with animals is Beatrix\u2019s way of avoiding risk and pain. She\u2019s never been quite the same since Mother and Father died. She was so young\u2014I think losing them both so quickly affected her more than the rest of us.\u201d Met with his silence, she gave him an anxious glance. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI think Beatrix will find someone when the time is right. And you\u2019re trying to bend fate to your will, which never works.\u201d He smoothed her hair back and kissed her forehead. \u201cRelax. Let your sister follow her own path.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not good at relaxing,\u201d Amelia said, a rueful grin tugging at the corners of her mouth. \u201cI\u2019m far better at worrying.\u201d</p><p>Cam slid a protective hand over the slight curve of her stomach. \u201cI can\u2019t allow that in your condition. Come upstairs with me, and I\u2019ll see if I can help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, but I don\u2019t need a nap.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking about a nap.\u201d</p><p>Meeting his gaze, Amelia saw the glint in his eyes, and her color rose. \u201cIn the middle of the day?\u201d she asked faintly.</p><p>A soft laugh escaped him. He stood and pulled her up from the settee, and kept her hand in his. \u201cBy the time I\u2019ve finished with you, hummingbird, you won\u2019t remember what you were worried about.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>Beatrix kept the young owl close to her body, stroking the sleek feathers of her back. She felt the nervous clench of the bird\u2019s talons against the leather gauntlet. The owl was light, fragile, and yet filled with tensile strength. \u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d she said gently. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of you. I\u2019ll have you well soon, so you can fly back to your family.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy sister is right, you know,\u201d she said as she carried the owl toward the barn.</p><p>\u201cI want to find a mate. But I\u2019ve been through two seasons, and I\u2019ve met a thousand men. And they\u2019re all so languid and lifeless, and most of them spend their days in idle amusement, waiting for someone to die so they can inherit. They take pride in being sophisticated, which means they say the opposite of what they really mean, and then you\u2019re supposed to praise them for being clever. Ha. At least when male owls come courting, they\u2019ll bring food for you.\u201d</p><p>The bird clicked quietly, her entire body vibrating.</p><p>\u201cI agree,\u201d Beatrix said. \u201cOne has to take the best of what\u2019s offered.\u201d A wistful smile touched her lips, and she curved her long fingers protectively around the stocky little body. \u201cIt\u2019s just that I can\u2019t help wishing to find someone who sees the world as I do. How silly and senseless all these rules are. Manners, corsets, gossip, asparagus forks . . . and heaven help me, polite conversation. If I can\u2019t talk about something real, I\u2019d rather not talk at all.\u201d</p><p>She paused as the owl chattered at her. \u201cWhat kind of man, you ask? I haven\u2019t the least idea. I like the idea of marrying a Rom, but it\u2019s awfully difficult to make them stay in one place. And I don\u2019t want to roam the world. I like Hampshire. I\u2019m quite territorial, actually.\u201d</p><p>Entering the barn, a large limestone building, she made her way to the upper hayloft. It was a chall barn, built into a slope so that both the first and ground floors were accessible without the need for steps. Down below, there was central threshing floor, a row of cattle shippons, and built-in sheds for carts and implements.</p> <p>Beatrix went to a corner of the hayloft, and settled the owl into a nest box.</p><p>\u201cHere you are,\u201d she said tenderly. \u201cA dry, safe place for you to rest. In just a little while I\u2019ll take my ferret Dodger to the granary, and we\u2019ll catch dinner for you.\u201d</p><p>Sunlight pressed through the slats of a louvered window, sending bright yellow stripes across the hayloft. Sitting by the nest box, Beatrix watched the owl preen herself. \u201cIs there someone waiting for you?\u201d she asked. \u201cSomeone who\u2019s wondering where you\u2019ve gone?\u201d</p><p>Leaning her head back against the wall, Beatrix closed her eyes and inhaled the comforting incense of hay and cattle and barn-smells. \u201cThe problem is, I\u2019m not going to find the man I want in a stuffy London drawing-room. I want . . .\u201d</p><p>But she fell silent, unable to confess or describe the intense yearning she felt, the caged feeling that would only be released by someone whose force of will equaled her own. She wanted to be loved . . . to be overtaken, challenged, surprised. And she had found no one like her imaginary lover in the succession of passive town dandies she\u2019d met during the season.</p><p>Picking up a stalk of hay, she nibbled thoughtfully at the tip, tasting its dry sweetness. \u201cIs it possible that I\u2019ve already met him but somehow overlooked him? I can\u2019t imagine it. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s not the sort of man one could--\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Beatrix!\u201d It was a young boy\u2019s voice, coming from the open threshing area below. \u201cMiss Beatrix, are you up there?\u201d</p><p>Beatrix\u2019s brows lifted. \u201cExcuse me,\u201d she told the owl, and went to peer over the edge of the hayloft. \u201cThomas,\u201d she exclaimed upon seeing one of the servants, an eleven year-old hall boy named Thomas. He lived with his parents in the village and came to work at Ramsay house every day after attending school. A busy, bright-eyed child, Thomas was given tasks such as polishing boots or cutlery, or assisting the footmen in their work. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p> <p>His round face was glum as he gazed up at her. \u201cAwful, miss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is the matter?\u201d Beatrix asked in concern.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve just come from seeing Fulloway\u2019s traveling menagerie show in the village.</p><p>I should have saved my tuppence.\u201d</p><p>Beatrix nodded, a frown pinching her forehead. The exhibition practices of such traveling menageries were criminal, in her opinion. Exotic animals such as tigers, lions and zebras were conveyed from town to town in so-called \u201cbeast wagons,\u201d and displayed to the public, along with bands and jugglers and other entertainments. The animals always looked dispirited and maltreated, which filled Beatrix with outrage. It was inhuman to take an animal from the wild and confine it to a cage to be gawked at for the rest of its life. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t abide traveling menageries,\u201d Beatrix said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not all that fond of zoological exhibitions, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI went to Fulloway\u2019s because they advertised a dancing elephant,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cBut Bettina\u2014that\u2019s the elephant\u2019s name\u2014dropped dead when they got here\u2014they made her walk too fast and too far, someone said. So they put up a sign that reads, \u201cDead elephant on display,\u201d and they showed it to us and let some people poke the carcass with sticks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need to hear more,\u201d Beatrix said. \u201cThat\u2019s dreadful, Thomas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s only one elephant left, a small one, but he won\u2019t dance or even stand up,\u201d the boy added. \u201cThe band plays music, and the trainers prod him with a bull hook, but he just lays there moaning.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019s mourning his friend,\u201d Beatrix said quietly.</p><p>\u201cThe dead one was his mother, they said.\u201d</p><p>A feeling of sadness pressed down on her, until Beatrix could hardly breathe from the weight of emotion. Closing her eyes, she thought, You can\u2019t save all of them.</p><p>Moreover, she couldn\u2019t let herself become any more eccentric than she already was.</p><p>No more misadventures. No more scrapes.</p> <p>\u201cYou have a way with animals, Miss Beatrix,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cMaybe you could visit the elephant and do something for \u2018im? If he would just move a little, they might stop jabbing him with that bull hook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not at all familiar with elephants,\u201d Beatrix said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing I can do. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll recover on his own, Thomas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, miss.\u201d Obviously disappointed, the boy went to attend to his chores.</p><p>Beatrix groaned and went back to the nest box. \u201cI can\u2019t help him,\u201d she said, staring at the drowsing owl. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>But she couldn\u2019t stop imagining the young elephant collapsed in despair, while people were entertained by the sight of his dead parent nearby.</p><p>God help her, she knew what it was like to lose a mother.</p> <p>The village green of Stony Cross had been temporarily enclosed for the Fulloway Menagerie, at least fifteen large caravans arranged in a rectangle. A decidedly flimsy fence had been erected to the north of the enclosure, while decorative displays and signs had been arranged in front to attract potential ticket buyers. To lure in onlookers, a band on a wooden platform played polkas and lively airs, while a trio of acrobats performed a balancing act.</p><p>Beatrix glanced dismissively at one of the yellow caravans, which had been painted with a likeness of George Fulloway, the owner of the menagerie. Fulloway was a florid-faced man with cheeks that hung like saddlebags on either side of a white goatee and a billowing mustache that seemed to pull his upper lip aloft as he smiled.</p><p>\u201cHe must love animals,\u201d Thomas commented, \u201cto collect so many of them.\u201d</p><p>Viewing the filthy monkey cages nearby, Beatrix smiled without humor. \u201cOne wonders,\u201d she said, \u201cif he has their best interests at heart. Where did you see the little elephant, Thomas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the pen on the other side of those wagons. The fencing\u2019s awful flimsy . . . it wouldn\u2019t hold him if he wanted to go somewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere would he go?\u201d Beatrix asked rhetorically.</p><p>They went cautiously around the perimeter of the fencing, and saw the dejected bulk of an elephant on the ground, beside the fence. He was smaller than Beatrix had expected, certainly no more than five feet when standing. His skin was gray, and sparsely covered with hair, and his ears were relatively small. An Indian elephant, reputedly more timid than the African species.</p><p>The animal\u2019s eyes were half-open, his gaze on Beatrix as she approached the fence. But he didn\u2019t stir, only lay there as if he were drugged or ill.</p> <p>Or prostrate with grief.</p><p>\u201cHello, boy,\u201d Beatrix said gently. \u201cWhat is your name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOllie, the sign said,\u201d Thomas volunteered.</p><p>Beatrix lowered to her haunches, looking at the elephant through the fence.</p><p>Taking out an apple she had brought, she rolled it through the flimsy slats. \u201cThat\u2019s for you, Ollie.\u201d</p><p>The young elephant regarded the fruit listlessly but made no move to take it.</p><p>\u201cLook at the scars on his stomach,\u201d Beatrix told Thomas. \u201cAnd the fresh wounds around his neck. They\u2019ve struck him with the bull hook in places where it\u2019s not as likely to show.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis hide looks right thick,\u201d Thomas observed. \u201cMaybe he doesn\u2019t feel it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think not? When something tears the skin until it bleeds, it is painful, Thomas.\u201d</p><p>The boy looked contrite. Before he could reply, however, they were interrupted by a harsh voice.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing? Making mischief, are you? Get away from that animal, both of you!\u201d</p><p>Beatrix stood slowly as a lean, hatchet-faced man approached them from inside the pen. He was dressed in rough clothes and a bowler hat with a rounded crown. One of his hands grasped a long implement with a large iron hook at the end.</p><p>\u201cWe meant no harm,\u201d Beatrix said, trying to sound conciliatory, even though she was filled with hostility at the sight of a man approaching a helpless animal with a weapon.</p><p>\u201cIf you want to see the animals, you\u2019ll have to pay tuppence like everyone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs the elephant ill?\u201d Beatrix asked.</p><p>The man responded with a scornful laugh. \u201cNo, only lazy.\u201d He brandished the bull hook. \u201cHe\u2019ll show some spirit before I\u2019m through.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPerhaps he needs some time to recover after the death of his mother.\u201d</p><p>A smile twisted the man\u2019s mouth. \u201cJust like a woman.

And considering what he eats, he\u2019d better earn his keep!\u201d He came to the dispirited creature, jabbing him with the bull hook. \u201cTime to dance, Ollie. You\u2019ll perform while the band plays, or I\u2019ll make short work of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay I speak to him?\u201d Beatrix asked impulsively. \u201cJust for a moment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeak to him?\u201d The request earned an incredulous glance, and he viewed her as if she were a halfwit. \u201cWho the blazes are you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis is Miss Hathaway,\u201d Thomas said, before Beatrix could hush him. \u201cAnimals love her\u2014she can speak their language. Please let her talk to him, sir!\u201d</p><p>The man began to laugh, shaking his head. \u201cSpeak elephant, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sir,\u201d Beatrix said with dignity. \u201cIt\u2019s only that I treat animals with kindness and respect. Most of them respond quite well to that. You might try it sometime.\u201d</p><p>The quiet rebuke seemed to sail right over his head. \u201cGo on, then. See if you can wheedle him into doing his job. And if your means don\u2019t work, mine will.\u201d</p><p>Beatrix nodded and lowered to the ground. \u201cOllie,\u201d she said softly. \u201cPoor Ollie. . . you must believe that I\u2019m a friend.\u201d Reaching her slender arm through the slats, she rested her hand on the ground, palm-up. \u201cI know you don\u2019t feel like eating, or dancing, or doing any of the things they want of you. I know your heart is broken. I lost my mother when I was young, too. And the truth is, you\u2019ll never stop missing her.</p> <p>But there are others who will love you. Who want to help you. And I\u2019m one of them.\u201d</p><p>As Beatrix spoke, an inquiring trunk crept toward her hand and touched her palm gently. She curved her fingers against the warm, rough skin. After a moment, Ollie held his trunk up to her face, seeking the scent of her breath. \u201cI\u2019ll help you,\u201d she whispered. \u201cTrust me. But for now, please get up and do as he asks.\u201d</p><p>The elephant reached for the apple, picked it up, and tucked it into his mouth.</p><p>Chewing slowly, he lurched to a sitting position, his bottom legs splayed in the manner of a young child.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s doing it,\u201d Thomas said in gratified wonder.</p><p>The man with the bull hook let out a bark of surprised laughter.</p> <p>It seemed none of them dared to speak, watching as Ollie got up one leg at a time. He faced Beatrix, standing as close as possible to the fence to view her with clear, heavily-lashed brown eyes. His trunk reached over the fence, and Beatrix extended her arm. Carefully he wrapped his trunk around her arm up to the elbow, a sort of elephant handshake.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough,\u201d the man declared, reasserting his dominance over the situation. \u201cIf you want to view the elephant, you can pay tuppence and go through the entrance along with the other visitors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a word of thanks?\u201d Thomas asked indignantly. \u201cIf it weren\u2019t for Miss Hathaway\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s perfectly all right,\u201d Beatrix interrupted, gently disentangling her arm from the elephant, trying desperately to ignore his stare of mournful appeal. \u201cWe have to go now. Goodbye, Ollie.\u201d</p><p>For now, she added silently, and forced herself to walk away.</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>A summer storm assailed Hampshire the night before Win and Merripen\u2019s wedding, lashing Stony Cross with rain and high winds that damaged homes and brought down trees. Thankfully there were no reports of injury to any of the village residents, and the morning rose bright and clear.</p><p>Win awoke with the vague memory of Kev having left her some time after midnight, so as not to risk the bad luck of seeing his bride on the wedding morning. My superstitious Rom, she thought with a drowsy smile, curling her arms around the pillow he had used.</p> <p>\u201cGood morning, dear,\u201d came Amelia\u2019s cheerful voice.</p><p>\u201cGood morning.\u201d Win sat up and yawned. \u201cIt\u2019s my wedding day! I thought it would never arrive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s here,\u201d Amelia said wryly, coming into the room. She was wearing a ruffled white dressing-robe and carrying a cup of tea. She gave the tea to Win and sat carefully on the edge of the mattress.</p><p>\u201cHave you been up and about for long?\u201d Win asked.</p><p>\u201cNearly a half-hour. And I have a great deal of news to report.\u201d</p><p>Win\u2019s fine brows lifted. \u201cAre we having any of the bad luck that Kev was worried about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo start with, Beatrix awoke with a head-cold, quite a snifter. I think she must have gone out to the barn during the storm to see if her owl was all right. She tracked in a cartload of mud and water, and the housekeeper is annoyed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoor Bea,\u201d Win said in concern, lifting the tea cup to her lips.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s more. The vicar sent a boy from the village this morning to tell us that a tree fell onto the room of the church and knocked part of it in. And the rain poured into the chancel and main sanctuary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no.\u201d Win frowned. Perhaps Kev\u2019s forebodings had been right, after all.</p><p>\u201cDoes that mean we\u2019ll have to put the wedding off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere the bridegroom anyone other than Merripen, I would say yes. But he\u2019s being stubborn. Cam and Leo are talking with him downstairs.\u201d</p><p>They were both silent for a moment, listening intently.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t hear any shouting,\u201d Win said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMerripen is being very calm, actually. But I think he\u2019s covertly planning to murder someone. He told me to come help you dress\u2014he says there will be a wedding.</p><p>Somehow. Somewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d Smiling, Win took another swallow of tea. \u201cI know better than to doubt him.\u201d</p><p>Having accompanied the errand boy to town, the Hathaways\u2019 brother Leo assessed the damage to the church and spoke to the vicar. Immediately upon returning to Ramsay House, Leo went to confer with Cam and Kev. Leo was a tall, blue-eyed scoundrel, articulate under pressure, perpetually irreverent. He was also a master at bending rules and slipping around regulations. If there were any way to push the wedding through, Leo would find it.</p> <p>\u201cNo chance of a ceremony inside the church,\u201d he reported to Kev and Cam as they gathered in the main parlor. \u201cIt\u2019s a sodding mess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get married on the church steps, then,\u201d Kev said.</p><p>\u201cImpossible, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d Leo looked rueful. \u201cAccording to the rubric of the church, it has to be inside a church or chapel that has been officially licensed. And neither the vicar nor the rector dare go against the laws. The consequences are so severe that they might receive three years\u2019 suspension. When I asked where the nearest licensed chapel was, they looked in the records. As it happens, about fifty years ago our estate chapel was licensed for a family wedding, but it ran out since then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we renew it?\u201d Cam asked. \u201cToday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked that. The rector seemed to think it was an acceptable solution, and he agreed as long as Merripen and Win promised to privately solemnize the marriage at the church as soon as the roof is repaired.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut the marriage would be legal starting today?\u201d Kev demanded.</p><p>\u201cYes, legal and registered, as long as it\u2019s held before noon. The church won\u2019t recognize a wedding if it\u2019s held even one minute after twelve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Kev said curtly. \u201cWe\u2019ll marry this morning at the estate chapel. Pay the rector whatever he demands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s only one problem with this plan,\u201d Cam said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have an estate chapel. At least, I\u2019ve never seen one.\u201d</p><p>Leo looked blank. \u201cWhat the bloody hell happened to it?\u201d</p><p>They both glanced at Kev, who had been in charge of the estate restoration for the past two years. He had taken down walls, razed small buildings, and made new additions to the original manor house.</p> <p>\u201cWhat did you do with the chapel, phral?\u201d Cam asked apprehensively.</p><p>A scowl settled on Kev\u2019s face. \u201cNo one was using it except some nesting birds.</p><p>So we turned it into a granary and attached it to the barn.\u201d In the face of their silence, he said defensively, \u201cIt still counts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to be married in a granary?\u201d Leo asked incredulously. \u201cAmong bins of animal feed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to be married anywhere,\u201d Kev said. \u201cThe granary\u2019s as good a place as any.\u201d</p><p>Leo looked sardonic. \u201cSomeone may want to ask Win if she is willing to be married in a former chapel that now amounts to a shed attached to the barn.</p><p>Forbearing as my sister is, even she has standards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m willing!\u201d came Win\u2019s voice from the stairs.</p> <p>Cam smothered a grin.</p><p>Leo shook his head and spoke in his sister\u2019s direction. \u201cIt\u2019s a barn, Win.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf our Lord didn\u2019t mind being born in a stable,\u201d she replied cheerfully, \u201cI certainly have no objection to being married in a barn.\u201d</p><p>Briefly lifting his gaze heavenward, Leo muttered, \u201cI\u2019ll go take care of the renewal fee. I can hardly wait to see the vicar\u2019s expression when I tell him we\u2019ve turned the chapel into a granary. It doesn\u2019t reflect well on this family\u2019s piety, let me tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re concerned about appearing pious?\u201d Kev asked.</p><p>\u201cNot yet. I\u2019m still in the process of being led astray. But when I finally get around to repenting, I\u2019ll have no damned chapel for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can repent in our officially licensed granary,\u201d Cam said, shrugging into his coat. He headed to the front door, opened it, and paused as the ebullient sound of guitars and Romany voices flowed inside.</p><p>Joining him at the door, Kev saw at least three dozen of their Romany relations clustered at the front of the house, dressed in colorful finery, singing and playing.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re supposed to be traveling,\u201d Kev said dazedly. \u201cWhat are they doing here?\u201d</p><p>Cam rubbed his forehead as if to push away an encroaching headache. \u201cIt looks like they\u2019ve come to help us celebrate your wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need that kind of help,\u201d Kev said.</p><p>Leo came up behind them. \u201cWell,\u201d he remarked, \u201cthe good news is, there\u2019s not much else than can go wrong now.\u201d</p><p>Thanks to the hurried efforts of Amelia, Poppy, Beatrix and their companion Miss Marks, the granary was adorned with flowers and white ribbon, and rose petals were scattered generously over the wooden floor.</p><p>After a generous so-called \u201crenewal fee,\u201d the vicar offered no objections to performing the ceremony in the makeshift chapel. \u201cAs long as it\u2019s done by twelve,\u201d he told the family, \u201cthe marriage will be registered today.\u201d</p><p>At precisely eleven-thirty, Kev waited with Cam at one end of the granary, which had been modified with large doors on both sides to allow for the easy transport of grain, implements and carts. Romantic guitar music floated in from outside, while an eclectic mixture of guests crowded into every inch of available space in the granary. A path was left clear for the bride. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Standing in the front of the granary with her family, Beatrix sneezed into a lace handkerchief. As she glanced at Merripen, she felt a surge of overwhelming happiness for him. He and Win had loved each other for so long, and had overcome so many seemingly impossible obstacles. How many people took marriage for granted, whereas for Merripen it was a reward for years of sacrifice.</p><p>Win entered the church on Leo\u2019s arm, and proceeded through the granary. She was pristine and beautiful in a simple dress, silk whiter than moonlight, overlaid with lace gauze, her face partially concealed by a lace veil. Merripen watched her as if he\u2019d found himself in some wondrous dream he didn\u2019t want to wake from.</p><p>Carefully he lifted the veil and folded it back, and stared down into Win\u2019s smiling face. The gaze they shared was intimate, trusting, ardent . . . it was devotion, Beatrix realized. The feeling between them seemed to cast a spell over the gathering.</p><p>\u201cDearly beloved,\u201d the vicar began, \u201cwe are gathered together here in the sight of God, and in the face of this congregation, to join together this Man and this Woman in holy Matrimony . . .\u201d</p> <p>Beatrix couldn\u2019t help but wish that the vicar would hurry. The hour of noon was fast approaching.</p><p>\u201c. . . therefore is not an enterprise to be taken unadvisedly, lightly, or wantonly, to satisfy men's carnal lusts and appetites, like brute beasts that have no understanding; but reverently, discreetly, advisedly, soberly . . .\u201d</p><p>Feeling another sneeze come on, Beatrix hastily buried her nose in her handkerchief. It was one of those sneezes that couldn\u2019t quite decide what it was going to do . . . it just hovered, tickling and stinging, until finally the feeling subsided.</p><p>Beatrix was relieved, because she certainly didn\u2019t want to disrupt the ceremony with a loud sneeze.</p><p>And then she saw it . . . a long gray trunk emerging from an open transom space between the barn and the granary. Beatrix\u2019s eyes widened. She couldn\u2019t move a muscle, couldn\u2019t say anything as the trunk delicately reached for Win\u2019s veil and headpiece, and plucked it off her head.</p> <p>A few gasps and yelps of surprise came from the crowd.</p><p>Lifting a hand to her head, Win shot a confused glance toward the transom.</p><p>Kev instinctively put a protective arm in front of her. Together they stared at Ollie, who watched them through the opening in the wall, waving the veil back and forth as if he were cheering them on.</p><p>Everyone fell silent, the group struggling as a whole to comprehend what their gazes were telling them.</p><p>Leo was the first to speak. \u201cBeatrix,\u201d he said calmly, \u201cdo you have something you\u2019d like to tell us?\u201d</p><p>Chapter Five</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Beatrix said, \u201cbut I can explain everything. You see, this poor animal was being terribly abused, and so I thought\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeatrix,\u201d Merripen interrupted, \u201cI\u2019m very interested to hear your explanation, but we only have a quarter-hour left. Could we\u2014\u201d He paused as Win turned her face into his shoulder and made a peculiar gasping sound. At first Beatrix thought her sister might have been crying, but as Merripen slid his fingers beneath Win\u2019s chin and tilted her face upward, it became evident that she was choking on giggles. Merripen couldn\u2019t hold back a grin. With an effort, he mastered himself and asked Beatrix mildly, \u201cCould the explanation wait until after twelve?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCertainly,\u201d she said, and motioned to Ollie to cease his veil-waving. He stopped and watched the ceremony attentively.</p><p>The vicar gave the elephant an apprehensive glance. \u201cI\u2019m not certain the church allows animals to attend weddings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf there\u2019s a fee for it,\u201d Leo assured him, \u201cwe\u2019ll settle up later. For now, let\u2019s proceed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my lord.\u201d Clearing his throat, the vicar continued the ceremony with great dignity. Eventually he said, \u201cTherefore, if any man can show any just cause why they may not lawfully be joined together, let him now speak, or else hereafter for ever hold his\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop at once!\u201d came a booming, stentorian voice, and the entire congregation turned toward the back of the granary.</p><p>Beatrix\u2019s stomach dropped as she recognized the man\u2019s distinctive white moustache and goatee.</p> <p>It was Mr. Fulloway, the owner of the traveling menagerie.</p><p>She didn\u2019t dare glance at Ollie, but out of the periphery of her vision she saw his trunk withdraw stealthily into the barn.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here to retrieve stolen property,\u201d Fulloway announced, his eyes narrowed to slits.</p><p>The man beside him carried a bull hook. He and Beatrix recognized each other at the same time. \u201cThat\u2019s her, Mr. Fulloway,\u201d he snapped. \u201cThe Hathaway girl I caught visiting Ollie in his pen yesterday. She\u2019s the one who took him, I guarantee it!\u201d</p><p>Leo stepped forward, suddenly looking every inch the aristocrat, his face hard, his eyes the icy blue of glaciers. \u201cI am Lord Ramsay,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re trespassing on my estate. And in case you hadn\u2019t noticed, you\u2019re interrupting a wedding.\u201d</p><p>Fulloway made a scoffing sound. \u201cYou can\u2019t get married in a barn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a barn,\u201d Leo said, \u201cit\u2019s our family chapel. There\u2019s the vicar, and that fellow with the large fists and the feral gaze is the bridegroom. And if I were you I wouldn\u2019t delay his wedding, or you may not live to see another morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not leaving until I get my elephant,\u201d Fulloway thundered. \u201cHe draws in paying customers, and I need him for my business, and besides, he\u2019s mine.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s here, Mr. Fulloway!\u201d came a muffled shout from the other side of the wall, and Beatrix realized with alarm that Fulloway had sent someone into the barn to look for Ollie.</p><p>The air was rent with a frightened trumpet. Ollie fled the barn and came racing into the attached granary, desperately seeking refuge. Seeing Beatrix, he went to hide behind her, his entire body trembling. She backed up to him protectively, and glared at the man with the bull hook as he strode toward her. \u201cYou can\u2019t have him, you butcher!\u201d she shouted.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a thief!\u201d Fulloway bellowed. \u201cI\u2019ll have you prosecuted!\u201d</p><p>The entire barn erupted into a cacophony, everyone shouting, Gypsies crowding in from outside, while Ollie trumpeted and screamed. Even the vicar had raised his voice in the effort to be heard.</p> <p>Merripen viewed the chaos in the granary with baffled fury.</p><p>\u201cQuiet!\u201d he thundered.</p><p>Everyone fell silent. Even the elephant.</p><p>\u201cFor the next ten minutes,\u201d Merripen warned the entire gathering, \u201cno one is to move, speak, or even breathe. All of this will be sorted out after noon. For now, any one of you who interrupts will find himself tossed headfirst into the nearest grain bin.\u201d</p><p>Win slipped her arm through his, and they turned to face the vicar.</p> <p>As Merripen stared at him expectantly, the vicar proceeded. \u201cWilt thou have this woman to thy wedded wife, to live together after God's ordinance in the holy estate of matrimony? Wilt thou love her, comfort her, honor, and keep her in sickness and in health; and, forsaking all other, keep thee only unto her, so long as ye both shall live?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d Merripen\u2019s voice was quiet but strong.</p><p>The vicar asked the same of Win.</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d A flush of happiness rose in her cheeks.</p><p>And the vows continued. \u201cFor better for worse, for richer for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish . . . with this Ring I thee wed, with my Body I thee worship . . .\u201d</p><p>Finally, Merripen slid a simple gold band onto Win\u2019s finger.</p> <p>The vicar finished, \u201cThose whom God hath joined together let no man put asunder.\u201d</p><p>And in one impassioned, decidedly improper, highly romantic moment, Merripen bent to kiss his bride. Her lace-covered arms rose around his neck, and she clasped him tightly, their mutual joy radiating through the makeshift chapel.</p><p>Beatrix smiled and dabbed her eyes. Still standing behind her, Ollie waved the wedding veil briskly, the tail of it flapping against her side.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d Mr. Fulloway said, coming forward, \u201cI\u2019ll take my elephant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Beatrix cried, glancing desperately at her family. \u201cThey\u2019ll kill him as they did his mother. Look at the wounds around his neck, and the\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush,\u201d Merripen said, making a staying gesture with his hand. Keeping his gaze on Fulloway, Merripen paused as Win stood on her toes to whisper something in his ear. He smiled ruefully. \u201cAnything you ask,\u201d he murmured. Stepping forward, Merripen inserted himself between Fulloway and the elephant. \u201cIt seems that my wife\u2014\u201d He hesitated almost imperceptibly, seeming to savor the last two words,</p><p>\u201cwould like to have the elephant as a wedding present. Which means we\u2019ll be negotiating for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not open to bargaining,\u201d Fulloway said. \u201cHe\u2019s the only elephant I\u2019ve got left, and\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou misunderstand,\u201d Merripen interrupted quietly. \u201cI\u2019m not asking if we can negotiate, I\u2019m informing you that we will.\u201d</p><p>Fulloway\u2019s complexion reddened behind snowy swaths of facial hair. \u201cNo one tells me what to do. Do you know who I am?\u201d He turned to gesture sharply to the man with the bull hook.</p><p>But at that precise moment Cam grasped the man\u2019s wrist, twisted sharply, and the bull hook clattered to the floor.</p><p>Behind Beatrix, Ollie flapped his ears and gave a rumbling chortle.</p><p>Fulloway found himself corralled between Leo and Merripen.</p><p>\u201cHave you heard of the legislation passed three years ago, outlawing wanton and malicious cruelty to animals?\u201d Leo asked. \u201cNo? Well, I know all about it, as I\u2019ve had to sit through everlasting sessions of Parliament while they\u2019ve brought up new amendments. And if you give us any further difficulty, you\u2019ll find yourself so busy defending against prosecutions, you\u2019ll have to close your bloody traveling show and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Fulloway said, unnerved by Merripen\u2019s threatening glare. \u201cI\u2019m willing to negotiate. But I want a fair price. This is no cut-rate elephant!\u201d</p><p>Beatrix sighed in relief. Ollie came to stand beside her, and she stroked his ear comfortingly. \u201cYou\u2019re not going back,\u201d she murmured. \u201cYou\u2019re safe now.\u201d</p><p>Her sister Amelia approached them, gazing at Ollie in wonder. Carefully Amelia reached out and rubbed the elephant\u2019s forehead, and smiled into his clear brown eyes. \u201cWhat a well-behaved fellow,\u201d she said. \u201cI never suspected an elephant would comport himself so nicely at a wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmelia,\u201d Beatrix said apologetically, \u201cI know what I promised earlier, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d Amelia said, her voice gentle. \u201cBefore you say anything, Bea . . . Cam told me to let you follow your own path. And he was right. You don\u2019t have to change yourself to suit someone else. You\u2019re perfectly wonderful the way you are.\u201d She smiled. \u201cAll I want is for you to be happy. And I don\u2019t think you could be, if you weren\u2019t free to follow your heart.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Beatrix launched forward and hugged her sister. \u201cI love you,\u201d she said.</p><p>As they stood embracing, Ollie tried to wrap his trunk around them.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not keeping him,\u201d Leo warned. \u201cYou\u2019re going to find some kind of sanctuary or refuge for him, Beatrix.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course. Some place with other elephants. He\u2019ll want to live among his own kind.\u201d Beaming, Beatrix led the elephant out of the granary. \u201cBut in the meantime . . . won\u2019t the neighbors love it when I take Ollie out for a walk?\u201d</p> <p>Dressed in a white nightgown, her fair hair loose and flowing, Win entered the bedroom to find Kev waiting for her.</p><p>Their first night as husband and wife.</p><p>And although Kev, in all his dark handsomeness, was beloved and familiar to her, she felt a pleasant ripple of nervousness.</p><p>He stripped off his shirt, revealing a sleek, powerful torso, and tossed it aside.</p><p>His gaze smoldered as it passed over her slowly. Standing beside the bed, he extended a commanding hand, palm-up.</p> <p>\u201cYour slipper,\u201d he said.</p><p>So he intended to adhere to the Romany tradition, Win thought, amused and perhaps the slightest bit annoyed.
