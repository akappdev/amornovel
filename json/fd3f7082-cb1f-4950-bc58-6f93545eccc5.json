It was July.</p><p>Greta shivered, knowing who it was even as her eyes remained focused on the counter she was cleaning. She took a deep breath and let it out slowly.</p><p>\u201cAnthony. We\u2019re closing up early.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe? You look quite alone. Where\u2019s your little redheaded friend? What\u2019s her name? Charlotte?\u201d The vampire licked his lips.</p><p>\u201cYou know very well what her name is.\u201d</p><p>She was beginning to regret sending Charlee home early. The other clerk may have been only human, but Anthony Burgess often struck when people were alone and vulnerable. He\u2019d always seemed amused when Charlee stood up to him, not knowing he could relieve her of her blood in seconds.</p><p>Greta focused on the counter as the Formica gave under the pressure of her hand. She met his eyes and tucked a strand of short dark hair behind her ear, grateful her kind couldn\u2019t be enthralled.</p><p>He wore the standard vampire uniform of basic black, his blond hair pulled back in a low ponytail. A long leather coat flowed out behind him as he strode toward her. All he needed now was menacing background music. Something dark and brooding.</p> <p>Anthony removed a soft-covered book from the rack beside the checkout without looking at the title and placed it on the counter.</p><p>His crystal blue eyes glowed and locked with Greta\u2019s dark brown.</p><p>He inhaled deeply, not bothering to mask his enjoyment of her scent.</p><p>\u201cWhen are you going to stop teasing me and let me have a taste?\u201d He stared pointedly at her neck. \u201cComing up on twenty-eight aren\u2019t you? Special year. Moon\u2019s nearly full.\u201d Greta\u2019s hand shook as she passed the scanner over the book\u2019s bar code. Therians, known to the mortals as Weres, celebrated their birthday not on the anniversary of their birth, but on the full moon closest to it. Twenty-eight wasn\u2019t a number to inspire ooohs and aaahs among the human set, but for a shapeshifter, the twenty-eighth birthday was bigger than the human twenty-one. It was a good drinking age for vamps anyway.</p><p>She took his money, made the change, and slipped the book into the opaque green shopping bag. Her eyes widened when she glimpsed the title. \u201cYou just bought a book on menstruation, Anthony. Were you aware?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged and smiled, revealing the barest hint of fang. \u201cI like blood.\u201d He scooped the bag up, gave her one last meaningful look, then drifted out of the store.</p> <p>Greta locked the door behind him and pressed her forehead against the cool wood. She could do with fewer bloodsucking patrons; they\u2019d increased in number since the last full moon. With her birth moon coming up, she might as well have a neon all you can eat sign posted in the window.</p><p>It was thirty minutes before she gathered the nerve to venture into the parking lot.</p><p>Most of the lights in the lot had burned out, and no one had bothered replacing them. With only one human employee and few after dark human patrons, it was deemed an unnecessary expense.</p><p>The residents of Cary Town might not realize what was out there, but they were shy of the dark all the same.</p><p>Greta\u2019s boots clicked loudly on the asphalt, making stealth a physical impossibility. She might as well shout to the vamps from a megaphone. Fresh meat, right here. Come and get it boys.</p><p>If Anthony or any of his ilk were lurking, they didn\u2019t take the bait. Nothing black-clad or fanged emerged from the shadows.</p><p>Anthony had gone home, or hunting, or whatever it was he did at night. For all she knew, he hung out at the all night grocery store scaring stock boys.</p><p>When she got home, her orange tabby was perched on the stoop, waiting to be let in.</p> <p>\u201cHello, Mink.\u201d She bent to scratch the kitty behind her ears and went inside, stopping in the hallway where the answering machine light blinked.</p><p>\u201cThis is your mother. I need to see you. Be discreet.\u201d Click.</p><p>Jaden was more abrupt than usual. Be discreet. Translation: be in fur.</p><p>Something was going down at the Lawson estate. She glanced at the hall clock, 9:45, plenty of time for a shower.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until Greta shut off the water that she remembered she hadn\u2019t done laundry. Shit. No towels. She closed her eyes and focused as images flowed over her mind. Milk, mice, open fields, birds, blades of grass, hunting, moon. Her senses heightened as she allowed the memories to bring forth the change. The room shrank and swirled around her. Her spirit jolted from her body, hovered for a moment, then was pulled back into her new compact form.</p><p>She stretched all the way down to the pads of her paws, then shook herself and licked her black fur down flat. There was going to be a hairball situation if she didn\u2019t do laundry soon. She hopped onto the pedestal sink, admiring herself in the mirror. She loved fur. It was so slimming.</p><p>While Greta preened, Mink sauntered into the room and hissed.</p><p>Greta hissed back. The house cat liked the therian fine in her human form but became agitated whenever she shifted. Tough. It was Greta\u2019s apartment. When Mink could turn into a human and get a job, then she\u2019d have a vote. Greta\u2019s poufy black tail curled under Mink\u2019s chin as she drifted past the tabby.</p><p>Simon\u2019s silver Lexus stood parked like a sentinel in her mother\u2019s driveway. It wasn\u2019t unusual for the tribe leader to be at the Lawson home, but seeing the car after the odd phone message made the hairs on the back of Greta\u2019s neck stand up.</p><p>She slipped through the plastic flap in the kitchen door and kept to the corners, slinking under the dilapidated furniture. Her nose twitched and she began to salivate as she caught the scent of a mouse. She forced herself to ignore it and edged closer to the family room where Simon and her mother spoke in the hushed tones usually reserved for church and funerals.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have to do this. Those are the old ways; surely we\u2019re beyond that now.\u201d</p><p>Simon allowed his hand to trail over Jaden\u2019s ass. \u201cYou knew this was coming. Greta was marked for sacrifice the moment she came into the world in her fur. I told you not to get attached.\u201d On hearing her name, Greta scooted further under the chair.</p><p>Therians were born in human form and died in their fur, not the other way around. Everybody knew that.</p><p>She\u2019d read legends about therians born in their fur and having extra powers, but she\u2019d always thought they were just stories.</p><p>Surely she would have noticed if she\u2019d developed more power suddenly.</p><p>Her mother\u2019s voice rose, taking on a more desperate tone. \u201cI thought you\u2019d change your mind. I thought if you loved me, you wouldn\u2019t take her. I should have followed my instincts and sent her far from here when she was still a baby.\u201d Simon laughed. \u201cThe border patrol would never have let you cross. They\u2019re loyal to me. We have one shot and I won\u2019t have you ruining it for the tribe, not like her mother tried to.\u201d Greta didn\u2019t have time to process the revelation that her mother wasn\u2019t her mother because Simon\u2019s cell phone started pounding out a sappy eighties ballad. How he listened to that shit and maintained an interest in the opposite sex remained one of the tribe\u2019s greatest mysteries.</p><p>\u201cI have to take this,\u201d Simon said, retreating to the far end of the room.</p><p>Greta followed Jaden to the kitchen and waited while the older woman scribbled something on a slip of paper, rolled it up, and stuck it in Greta\u2019s mouth.</p><p>\u201cDid you get all that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrraar,\u201d she said around the paper.</p><p>\u201cGo to this place. It\u2019s the only person in the city who can keep you safe.\u201d</p><p>Simon\u2019s voice grew louder as he approached the kitchen. Before he could see her, Greta leaped off the table and scurried out the cat door.</p><p>Humans had been busy the past several decades tearing down walls that trapped people in their homelands. The preternaturals, meanwhile, had been engaged in building them up. Normally it didn\u2019t bother her so much; but now she could palpably feel the invisible cage that kept her locked inside the walls of the city, making her world feel claustrophobic, where before it had been a cocoon of perceived safety.</p><p>There was one person she was close to who wasn\u2019t a member of the tribe. She ran three blocks, scratched on Charlee\u2019s door, and nearly jumped out of her fur when the dog barked. A tiny redheaded woman mumbled a few warnings to the dog and flipped on the porch light.</p><p>Greta tried to look unassuming and adorable. \u201cMrarrr.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwwww, aren\u2019t you the cutest!\u201d</p><p>Score.</p><p>Charlee bent to scoop Greta up and shooed the dog out of the house. \u201cGo play, Sammy.\u201d</p><p>The Irish setter ignored her, choosing instead to lick Greta as he normally did, not noticing she was a cat now. Charlee\u2019s brows drew up in confusion. She swatted him on his haunches until he ran off down the dirt road, tail wagging.</p><p>\u201cStupid dog. Doesn\u2019t know he\u2019s supposed to hate cats. That could be good news for you, sugar plum.\u201d Once inside, Greta sprang from Charlee\u2019s arms and bolted for the bathroom. She was thankful for the flimsy door as she slammed it shut with the full weight of her feline body. She hopped up on the counter and pressed the push button lock with her paw, then dropped gracefully to the floor.</p><p>Charlee jiggled the knob on the other side. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll be damned. Honey, how\u2019d you lock yourself in?\u201d In. Out. In. Out. Think of something calming. Waves lapping the shore, rolling green meadows. Moments later Greta was curled naked on the floor. She spit the roll of paper out of her mouth. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Printed in Jaden\u2019s cramped script, was an address in the city.</p><p>And a name. Dayne Wickham.</p><p>For a second, Greta couldn\u2019t breathe and thought she might shift back. It had to be a mistake. Jaden couldn\u2019t mean for her to go to him. Dayne Wickham was notorious. He wasn\u2019t just a magic user. He was a sorcerer. People still talked about the night he\u2019d massacred more than half the tribe.</p><p>There was a soft knock on the door. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you managed to lock yourself in there kitty, but I\u2019ve got tools and I\u2019m going to get you out. Okay?\u201d</p> <p>Greta wrapped a bathrobe around herself and opened the door.</p><p>Charlee fell back, her eyes wide, tools spread around her in a fan.</p><p>She must have found a sale. Or else she was dating a contractor.</p><p>\u201cSo, yeah, I\u2019m a cat and I need to borrow some clothes.\u201d She hoped she wouldn\u2019t have to do the whole transformation all over just to prove it. Surely, cat goes in, human comes out was enough evidence. Especially with no windows or other exits in the bathroom.</p><p>Charlee gawked up at her. \u201cWhat are you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA therian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA whatian?\u201d</p><p>Greta sighed and used the term she hated. \u201cWerecat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can turn into a cat? Seriously? How? When? Have you always done it? Did you get bitten by another werecat? What else is real? Can you turn back into a cat now? Do you have other superpowers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharlee . . . \u201d she said with as much patience as she could muster.</p><p>By this time Charlee had managed to stand and was prowling around her, looking as if there might be an instruction manual printed somewhere on Greta\u2019s body.</p> <p>\u201cClothes,\u201d Greta said, trying to bring her friend back to the issue at hand.</p><p>\u201cSure. Clothes. No problem, but show me the werecat thing.\u201d Charlee moved to the bedroom, Greta trailing behind her.</p><p>\u201cListen, I can\u2019t imagine how I would feel if the tables were turned, but I don\u2019t have time for show-and-tell right now. You\u2019ll be safer the less you know. They\u2019ll use a spell to track me, so I need to be somewhere with strong wards. I just need some clothes to last me a few days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpells are real too? So then . . . witches . . . and . . . \u201d</p><p>\u201cCharlee!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right. Sure. Borrow whatever you want; I\u2019ll pack you a bag.\u201d</p><p>Greta pulled on a pair of jeans and T-shirt from the floor. Her face scrunched up in distaste at the outfits her friend was throwing into the bag. Charlee believed in dressing sexy like it was a religion.</p><p>It was a little more than Greta personally wanted to show off, but it was better than nudity.</p> <p>\u201cAre you sure this is all I can do to help? I could go on the lam with you.\u201d</p><p>Greta hid a smile. She wished she could take her up on her offer, and for a moment a fantasy of Thelma and Louise-ing it through Cary Town caught her imagination. But Charlee wasn\u2019t prepared to deal with what was out there, and Greta couldn\u2019t protect her.</p><p>She watched as her friend tossed some makeup and a couple of trashy romance novels into the bag. Only Charlee would think running for your life was the time to read romance and wear lipstick. Greta decided she should have told her friend about her double life long ago. If not for the ridiculous loyalty she\u2019d felt for the tribe that now intended to strap her down to a stone altar, she probably would have.</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>AYNE Wickham sat hunched over his computer. His pos-Dture showed his age even as his face and physique refused to. He brushed a clump of dark hair out of his eyes and stared at the twitchy screen in front of him. Technology was a beautiful thing. He\u2019d found a most reliable supplier of were-blood on the Internet.</p><p>Theriantype.com had a cross-referencing index matching the correct were-blood type to specific rituals. It was almost enough to make a sorcerer pack all his musty old books into storage and move everything to the computer. Almost.</p><p>He\u2019d met Alistair Cranze on a magic user\u2019s message board. The wizard had recommended the site, and for the past year Dayne hadn\u2019t had any trouble. He couldn\u2019t remember how he\u2019d managed to get by before. Werecat was considered the most magical of all were-blood types. And for this working, even more so.</p><p>The mythology claiming a witch\u2019s familiar to be a cat was rooted somewhat in fact. Werecats without a tribe had sought witches, wizards, and occasionally a sorcerer or two. They\u2019d traded blood for shelter for centuries.</p><p>Things were different now. These days, Weres in need of cash donated anonymously to one of the blood banks, and various magic users just ordered what they needed from occult shopkeepers or online. It was much cleaner this way.</p><p>Weres could be more trouble than they were worth. Most magic users had learned that the hard way, as there seemed to be a certain level of idiotic stubbornness that came with the territory of wielding magic.</p><p>Dayne rolled his mouse over the send button and clicked, then leaned back in his chair, interlacing his fingers behind his head. He smiled as the animated GIF wand waved, and purple digital glitter sprinkled over his computer desktop, indicating his order was being processed. The site was on the cheesy side, but a reliable company was a reliable company, cutesy bells and whistles notwithstanding.</p><p>There was one thing about the white lighters. You could trust them. They lived their entire lives according to a mission of goodness and honesty. It made Dayne want to hurl, but with few exceptions, they wouldn\u2019t betray you.</p><p>He\u2019d just shut down the computer when a rap sounded on the front door. No one knocked on his door anymore. Primarily because he was known as the city\u2019s darkest evil and everyone was too scared to try to overthrow him. The postman had long ago learned the wisdom of quietly leaving packages by the door. Dayne didn\u2019t know what the fuss had been about. The man\u2019s hair had regrown in a mere matter of months.</p><p>\u201cJust a moment, please.\u201d</p><p>Whoever was calling after midnight could only be bringing trouble with them. For a while, after what was later called: the tribal massacre, the lone hero had darkened his door, convinced Dayne was up to something nefarious and had to be taken down. Or another Cary Town villain decided to rise to infamy and needed Dayne out of the way to do it.</p><p>He\u2019d eventually managed the right formula on the wards, and most steered clear, deciding it wasn\u2019t worth it. It had been quiet for the past decade. Either the wards were working or he\u2019d been deemed irrelevant. Either way was fine by him.</p><p>The wards dropped as Dayne opened the door to reveal a diminutive black cat with bright golden eyes sitting primly on the middle of his front stoop. She blinked up at him full of rehearsed pet store innocence, her tail wrapped around her tiny paws.</p><p>\u201cMrarrr.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must be kidding me. I don\u2019t take in strays.\u201d Dayne slammed the door. Did the werecat think he couldn\u2019t sense the magic crackling around her? Was she that naive? Perhaps a junior wizard still under apprenticeship would have been fooled, but not someone with his level of experience.</p><p>He drained the last dregs of coffee from the mug in the microwave. There was a second knock.</p><p>\u201cOh, for God\u2019s sake.\u201d He was going to zap the little miscreant halfway across town and let the preternatural border patrol sort out the pieces.</p><p>Dayne opened the door this time with a spell ready on his lips, but stopped short. She was breathtaking, not that this was uncommon in a Were. They tended to have a certain magnetism.</p><p>She had short dark hair, and she was leggy . . . a personal weakness of his.</p><p>Black leather pants encased her legs as if they\u2019d been stitched onto her. It seemed only magic could have gotten those pants on and would be required to get them off again. A red silky top plunged to reveal ample but not overpowering cleavage. The werecat had a large duffel bag slung over one shoulder and balanced against her hip as if she\u2019d planned to move in.</p><p>He held up a hand before little Dayne could cause him to do something colossally stupid. \u201cThe wardrobe change doesn\u2019t alter my position, princess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d be old,\u201d she said, wrinkling her nose.</p><p>He gave her points for not stammering that opening line. \u201cWhat leads you to believe I\u2019m not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need help.\u201d</p><p>Well, she got right down to it, didn\u2019t she? Such a Red Riding Hood. It was intoxicating. In a different mood, with a different species, he might have let her into his lair.</p><p>\u201cNot interested. Try the Salvation Army.\u201d The brunette wedged one high-heeled boot inside the door.</p><p>\u201cPlease. I\u2019ll be killed. The tribe plans to sacrifice me.\u201d Desperate, frightened eyes.</p><p>\u201cAnd somehow I can\u2019t work up any feeling on that topic. Good-bye now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait! You can use my blood.\u201d</p><p>Dayne arched a brow. Not quite as naive as she appeared.</p><p>\u201cI get my were-blood online. I have no use for you.\u201d In truth, he could think of many uses for her, none of which required the promise of her potent magical blood.</p><p>The phone rang, preventing little Dayne from taking over. \u201cIf you\u2019ll excuse me.\u201d</p><p>Appearance-wise Dayne had been nothing like she\u2019d expected.</p><p>She\u2019d expected an old man with long robes and a beard, dark beady eyes, and a sinister thin mouth. A beak-like nose and long age-gnarled fingers would finish the look. Dayne was none of these things. For one thing, he\u2019d been wearing blue jeans and a T-shirt. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>For another, he\u2019d been hot, debonair even. Except for the evil.</p><p>Despite the danger he exuded, Greta turned the doorknob and slipped into the cottage.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do this to me, Mick. You know I need this blood.\u201d Dayne stood at the other end of the room making a pot of coffee, his back to her. A cordless phone was pressed between his ear and shoulder.</p><p>Greta dropped the duffel bag on the floor without a sound and tuned her amplified hearing in to listen to his phone call. The other man\u2019s voice trembled over the phone.</p> <p>\u201cI . . . I . . . understand that sir, but we have a f . . . firm policy of only delivering to those who follow our code of ethics and it\u2019s been b . . . brought to my attention that you . . . don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very unhappy about this. It was Alistair wasn\u2019t it? That little shit was my bestest best friend until he found out I wasn\u2019t out saving the world every night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, Sir, I\u2019m just doing what my boss told me. He said to tell you it\u2019s a conflict of interests to continue delivering your ship-ments.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see. Well, don\u2019t think I won\u2019t be reporting you to the Board of Magical Merchants for discrimination. There are laws against this sort of thing.\u201d</p><p>Greta heard Mick\u2019s sigh of relief over the phone. Someone like Dayne Wickham reporting him to a board of magical anything was minor, the equivalent of an angry shopper threatening never to return.</p> <p>Dayne stabbed his finger against the button to end the call, then flung the phone across the room. Greta froze. His back was still to her when he spoke.</p><p>\u201cI thought I told you to leave. Or was my dismissal not clear enough? Perhaps it would help if I spelled it out with catnip.\u201d He turned to face her. \u201cOr I could carve the message.\u201d His glance shifted to a gleaming silver ritual knife balanced precariously on the edge of the desk. Silver wouldn\u2019t kill her necessarily, but it burned like hell and was much harder to heal.</p><p>Dayne blazed across the floor and grabbed Greta by the wrist, hauling her back to the entryway. \u201cHave you any idea the danger you put yourself in when you trespass on a sorcerer\u2019s property?</p><p>Shall I enlighten you?\u201d</p><p>Greta wrenched herself free of his grip. \u201cYou don\u2019t have a supplier now. I\u2019ll give you the blood you need if you\u2019ll let me stay until after the full moon. I won\u2019t cause any trouble.\u201d She wasn\u2019t sure why she was still asking to stay. He\u2019d just made a not so subtle hint about using her skin as a carving block. Hiding in a hollowed-out tree for the next several nights was sounding like a more sane option than remaining with the unhinged sorcerer.</p><p>Dayne had crossed his arms over his chest, his stance wide, and to the human eye, relaxed. But Greta could smell the tendrils of controlled anger coming off him. She\u2019d always been able to smell emotion, but the scent seemed sharper now.</p> <p>\u201cThey send one of you, all pretty and in distress, and I\u2019m supposed to fall all over myself trying to protect you? Let\u2019s get one thing clear. I\u2019m the bad guy. I don\u2019t rescue fair maidens.\u201d Greta flushed at the pretty part, glossing right over the bad guy part.</p><p>He muttered something in Latin with his arm outstretched, and for a moment Greta thought she was about to die. Instead, the cordless phone floated from behind him to his waiting hand. His eyes remained trained on her as he punched the numbers into the phone.</p><p>\u201cClarissa, I\u2019m sorry to wake you love, but I was wondering if you might be persuaded to set aside a pint of werecat blood for me.</p><p>I need it by the full moon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Wickham, um hi,\u201d a sleepy voice on the other end answered. \u201cNo, it\u2019s okay. You\u2019re our best customer. We actually don\u2019t have any therian cat blood in stock. We can get some, but it\u2019ll take six weeks; our supplier\u2019s backed up. You could try a local therian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeow,\u201d Greta said, still in human form.</p><p>\u201cI see. Well, thank you anyway.\u201d Dayne clicked off the phone and glared at Greta, as if she\u2019d somehow personally gummed up the works.</p><p>\u201cSo, then I can stay?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to erect stronger wards. Please keep in mind, you are here for my convenience due to inventory troubles. I\u2019m not your knight in shining armor. I don\u2019t care about your personal problems.</p><p>And if you wander from the protection of this house, I will not be lured into the trap to save you. I don\u2019t get involved with Weres.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTherians,\u201d Greta said, returning his glare.</p><p>\u201cIf I were you, I would remember that although I would like to do this ritual this full moon, there are infinite full moons available to me. You might not be so lucky. I\u2019ll be in my study gathering supplies for the wards.\u201d</p><p>His footsteps receded down the hallway, and Greta made a face.</p><p>Finally alone, she took in her surroundings.</p><p>She\u2019d expected a medieval-looking castle equipped with a full dungeon, or some austere mansion. His home was neither. It was . . . cozy, though larger than the average cottage. The fireplace crackled with dying embers that had recently warmed something in a small iron cauldron.</p><p>The main room was lined with dark oak bookshelves and rows upon rows of books. The walls were stone but emitted a sense of warmth, the direct opposite of Dayne.</p><p>Maybe it was a timeshare.</p><p>Greta suppressed a giggle as she tried to imagine Dayne Wickham, the hapless victim of a timeshare scheme. It would explain his sour demeanor.</p><p>Two windows on either side of the fireplace were open with long lightweight crimson drapes hanging in front of them. A storm was brewing. As the wind howled outside, the curtains were sucked into the screen, then puffed back out as if the wall itself were breathing. Greta was still staring at the windows, mesmerized by the sensation of the house breathing, when Dayne returned.</p><p>\u201cCome with me. I\u2019ll need some of your blood, since you seem to be in a donating mood.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes drifted back to the knife on the table.</p><p>\u201cIf I were going to harm you, I would have already done so. I grow very quickly bored with the practice of building trust in others only to crush it at the last possible moment. Unlike some species.\u201d</p><p>Greta flinched at the look he gave her. But when he turned, she followed. The dwelling went deeper than it appeared from the outside, and it occurred to her that the floor was sloping downward as they worked their way to an underground part of the house.</p><p>The hairs on the back of her arm stood at attention as the passageway narrowed until it was only big enough for two people.</p><p>Then it began to spiral more steeply down, and the smooth slope became stairs. It was such a gradual transition, she wasn\u2019t sure if it was the architecture itself, or magic.</p><p>At the bottom of the stairs was a large stone room with shelves of books lining the walls, as well as potions, pots, wands, and grisly items in cloudy jars. Cobwebs had grown over much of the area.</p><p>There were a couple of unlit torches on the wall, though the room\u2019s illumination came from a dome light in the ceiling. A steel cage stood in the back, its purpose most likely not on the up-and-up.</p><p>Greta shivered. So much for Dayne not having a dungeon.</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>E had to admit, she was a good little actress. Almost as Hgood as Jaden had been. The werecat stood at the bottom of the stairs barely inside the cavernous room where he performed his more complicated rituals. Her arms were wrapped tightly around her, a protective barrier against him, no doubt.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to be paranoid, but he wondered if the tribe had been responsible for his were-blood supply being cut off. The timing was too coincidental for his liking. There had been rumblings that the tribe leader was getting more powerful these days. Could Simon know Dayne planned to act against him on the next full moon?</p><p>It had been thirty years since Dayne\u2019s last encounter with Cary Town\u2019s werecat tribe. He\u2019d nearly died thinking he was saving Jaden\u2019s life, only to be led into a trap. If he hadn\u2019t fortified himself with so much magic, he would\u2019ve been killed.</p><p>He\u2019d gotten lucky. Shapeshifters, though made of magic, didn\u2019t know how to wield it. He\u2019d taken out most of the tribe and managed to escape, sustaining several injuries, including a few to his pride.</p><p>Now they were sending this little number to lure him away.</p><p>Didn\u2019t they have any new material? Dayne\u2019s eyes drifted to the cage in the back corner. One never knew when one might need such a contraption. He ran his hand idly over the bit of stubble growing on his chin as he contemplated the cage. He should lock her up until the ritual, use her blood, then throw her out.</p><p>If anything, such an act would send a message to the tribe that Dayne Wickham was not to be fucked with. He was suddenly glad he was acting against Simon now, rather than later. He\u2019d put it off far too long. For whatever inane reason, Jaden loved Simon. It had taken years for Dayne\u2019s love for her to diminish to the point that he could dispatch her lover without guilt.</p><p>He considered taking the Were\u2019s blood now and getting rid of her. Except, even he wouldn\u2019t stoop to that level of dishonor. It had nothing to do with anything the tribe may plan to do to the girl.</p><p>\u201cAre you cold?\u201d he asked. Dammit.</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>Eventually, a pouty-lipped woman, like this one, was going to get him killed. Prudence would dictate he wait for another full moon, but the effects of the spell wouldn\u2019t be nearly so strong at any other time. Simon was ready to end this now, and Dayne might not get another chance. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSit.\u201d He motioned to a painted white circle in the middle of the floor.</p><p>She bit her bottom lip and slowly moved into the center of the circle.</p><p>\u201cAre you having second thoughts about being here?\u201d She nodded.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p> <p>Dayne crossed to the far wall and selected a large and well-worn book from the uppermost shelf. He took a small needle from the desk drawer nearest the bookcase and opened the book to the correct page.</p><p>He pricked her finger, ignoring her indignant cry, and squeezed several drops of blood into the center of the circle. When he released her hand to say the incantation, she sucked on her finger.</p><p>It took every ounce of willpower for his eyes not to linger on her pretty little mouth.</p><p>He focused more intently on chanting.</p><p>When he closed the book, the werecat stood and placed her hands on her hips. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to come to you for help. You were my only choice. You\u2019re the strongest magic user in the city, and we dislike the same people. I don\u2019t know what your problem is, but I don\u2019t want to die. My moth . . . Jaden gave me your address. I was in cat form so I couldn\u2019t exactly ask questions but . . . \u201d Before she could finish the sentence, she was lying on her back, Dayne\u2019s hand wrapped around her throat. He stopped squeezing when he registered the look in her eyes. She\u2019d clearly forgotten she was stronger than he was. Something he could use.</p> <p>\u201cWho did you say sent you?\u201d He poured menace into his voice, intent on keeping her on edge and pressing his advantage.</p><p>\u201cJaden . . . I . . . Please . . . \u201d Greta\u2019s fingernails dug into his arms in panic.</p><p>He released her. \u201cForgive me. I have trust issues.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, no shit.\u201d Greta shot back to her feet, the slight crouch of her body showed she was ready for him. She rubbed her throat.</p><p>\u201cDid I hurt you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou scared me. I almost shifted.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs that a bad thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t fight worth a damn in my fur.\u201d She crossed her arms defensively over her chest.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Her face flushed in anger. \u201cAre you? Because the way it looks to me, we both have a problem and we both have a solution. You need blood; I have blood. I need protection; you have protection.</p><p>This doesn\u2019t seem all that complicated to me. Does it seem complicated to you?\u201d</p><p>Dayne crossed his arms over his chest. \u201cI have ground rules, Were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. I have a ground rule too.\u201d</p><p>One brow rose. \u201cOh? Do tell.\u201d</p> <p>While it was indeed true that she could kick his ass without blinking if he suddenly developed laryngitis, he would wager he could chant faster than she could drop kick him. Not every spell required books and herbs, candles or circles, or any of the million and one accoutrements the magical set swore by.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me Were. If you\u2019re really that old, you know that\u2019s offensive. Whatever your therian issue is, put it aside, I\u2019m not whoever did you wrong. I would prefer to be called by my name if that wouldn\u2019t be too much trouble.\u201d</p><p>He cocked his head to the side and studied her. She alternated so quickly between timid and smart-mouthed, he thought he might be dealing with a multiple personality. It wouldn\u2019t be the first time in his long existence. Dayne\u2019s mouth curved in a genuinely amused smile before he caught himself and returned to his former cold expression. \u201cVery well, and your name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreta.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that your only rule, Greta?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, the wind going out of her sails as she returned to being the frightened kitty. He wondered if she was aware of these highly irregular mood swings.</p><p>\u201cMy rules are as follows: You will not leave this house until after the full moon. If your tribe truly plans to sacrifice you, the wards will keep you safe as long as you remain inside. If you leave, you will not be allowed back in. Since I can\u2019t keep an eye on you 24/7, when I can\u2019t watch you you\u2019ll be locked in the guest room.</p><p>For my own personal safety, of course.\u201d</p><p>She stood perfectly still for a moment, the tension radiating off her body as she clenched and unclenched her hands at her sides.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t let you lock me up.\u201d She\u2019d said it calmly, her tone completely even, but she turned and ran up the stairs. Moments later, the front door slammed.</p><p>He shook his head and sighed. The spell hadn\u2019t lied. He had. He hadn\u2019t needed her blood to strengthen the wards. The wards were fine as they were, barring his bad habit of voluntarily opening the door without looking through the peephole first. He\u2019d needed her blood for a truth spell.</p><p>The light that had glowed around her immediately after he\u2019d finished the incantation should have left no doubt to her honest need. Though again, he wasn\u2019t running a charity service. So why he should feel the need to help random Weres in distress like some sort of magical halfway house, he couldn\u2019t be sure.</p><p>He\u2019d felt the fear pouring off her and conceded no one was that good an actress. He\u2019d watched her eyes flash between brown and yellow as she\u2019d tried to stop from shifting. Still, he wouldn\u2019t put it past Jaden to be using her.</p><p>Dayne shrugged. It was no longer his problem. Let someone else handle it. He wasn\u2019t going to become a hero; they didn\u2019t normally survive long.</p><p>He climbed the stairs and found Greta\u2019s abandoned bag beside the front door. Rifling through it, he found makeup, clothes, and a few tacky books with shirtless men and women with heaving bosoms.</p><p>He crossed back to the computer, loaded the web browser, and typed, \u201cSacrifice,\u201d \u201cTherian\u201d into the search box. Several sites popped up, most about werecats. This breed liked their sacrifice.</p><p>Dayne clicked the link that looked most helpful. The screen filled with morbid drawings of beautiful women, sometimes men, chained down to stone slabs, blood being drained from them into a type of moat around the altar as the others shifted into their animal form.</p><p>The images showcased a type of twisted sadism that most reserved for those not of their kind. Further down the page were photographs. One in particular caught his attention.</p><p>The woman\u2019s hair was longer than Greta\u2019s, but the same shiny dark brown. Otherwise, she resembled her enough that Dayne could almost see Greta on the slab instead. He scrolled the mouse over the arrow to leave the page.</p><p>A warmth prickled over his senses. The kitty was still in the house. He should have been angry, but after the photos what he felt was relief that she was still safely ensconced in his well-warded fortress. Somewhere. Cats were experts at hiding. If he\u2019d been a human without magic running through his veins, he might never have known.</p><p>And now she was terrified of him. Had he worked the evil persona so strongly that he\u2019d become so? He wasn\u2019t all fluffy goodness and light, but he hadn\u2019t thought he\u2019d sunk to mustache-twirling levels of evil.</p><p>He focused on the bookcase, causing one of the books to fly off the shelf into his hand. He flipped to the appropriate passage and whispered the incantation necessary to lock all the doors and windows, then he allowed the book to fly back to its place.</p><p>He needed to get out and socialize more. Even ten years ago, Dayne never would have made a speech like the one he\u2019d made in the basement about locking her up. It sounded like it had come out of Evil for Dummies. A less insane sorcerer would lock up the books he didn\u2019t want her in, not lock her up. Or perhaps a sorcerer would lock her up.</p><p>He started down the hallway, his footfalls light and measured.</p><p>\u201cHere, kitty kitty.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>RETA huddled under Dayne\u2019s bed, her fur pressed flat Gagainst the wall. She\u2019d barely maintained her form in the basement. Now she was too keyed up to shift back and climb out the window. Footsteps thudded and stopped with heavy finality just outside the door.</p><p>Please don\u2019t find me. Please don\u2019t find me. Her heart beat erratically in her tiny chest, in tempo to her silent pleas. She wondered if a cat could hyperventilate. If it had been Simon outside the door, he would have heard her panting and it would have been all over.</p><p>She tried to stay focused on the plan. Of course, Dayne would return to his room. That was the point. He\u2019d finally go to sleep and she could slip out and eat something, then keep out of sight until after the full moon.</p><p>After all, what kind of idiot hides in the bedroom of the bad guy? It was probably a bad question given her current circumstances, but it had seemed halfway brilliant at the time she\u2019d thought of it.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t be sure why she\u2019d slammed the door earlier without first going through it, except that Dayne was her only hope.</p><p>Without magic to cloak her, she was at the mercy of the tribe.</p><p>And no one else in Cary Town was strong enough to counteract the magic of the few witches in the tribe\u2019s employ. If Jaden thought Dayne was her only chance, then he was.</p><p>The bed dipped above her and the bedsprings creaked as Dayne laid back and sighed. \u201cYou can come out now. I\u2019m not going to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>Yeah right. She remained hidden, though she was sure he could use magic to bring her out. She couldn\u2019t be that difficult to levitate at house cat weight.</p><p>\u201cGreta . . . \u201d</p><p>The bed creaked again as his weight lifted, then his eyes were level with hers. He held out a hand. She hissed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not having a conversation like this,\u201d he said, his voice sounding so reasonable she almost trusted him. \u201cYou have to come out eventually.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She wished she could ask him to back away so she could come out on her own, but her cat-shaped mouth wouldn\u2019t form human words, and it seemed unlikely he was fluent in the subtle nuance of the meow. When she\u2019d finally edged out, he picked her up. She reacted.</p><p>\u201cOw!\u201d Dayne howled, dropped her, and cradled his bleeding arm. \u201cFuck!\u201d</p><p>Greta scrambled onto the bed and burrowed underneath the pillow, her little black face poking out at him. Her eyes widened at the long bright bloody trails she\u2019d left. Didn\u2019t Dayne know anything about cats? It wasn\u2019t like she could shut that instinct off.</p><p>She inched out from under the pillow, arched her back, and hissed. She expected to see anger in his eyes, instead she saw . . . guilt? She settled on top of the feather pillow and wrapped her tail around her as Dayne disappeared into the bathroom. When he returned, his arm was bandaged. She could smell the hydrogen peroxide he\u2019d used to disinfect the cuts as if he\u2019d been wounded on a battlefield instead of a few cat scratches. Men could be such babies.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t like blood,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cMrarr?\u201d Greta cocked her head to the side. He\u2019d taken her blood not an hour ago. He didn\u2019t seem to have a problem then.</p><p>\u201cMy own blood. I have no trouble with the blood of others.\u201d Those calmly spoken words should have had her fleeing back under the bed to the safety she\u2019d just left, but she remained frozen in place. She would have felt better if she could shift back to a form she could fight in. But she couldn\u2019t, not with him there.</p><p>\u201cIf I sit next to you, are you going to claw me again?\u201d She shook her head, and Dayne settled beside her.</p><p>\u201cI apologize for my earlier behavior. I was nearly killed because of Jaden many years ago. So I have a hard time trusting Weres.</p> <p>Especially Weres from your tribe.\u201d</p><p>Greta growled.</p><p>\u201cTherians,\u201d he corrected. \u201cHowever, at this point I don\u2019t believe you\u2019re lying to me. Ordinarily I wouldn\u2019t get involved, but you\u2019re right. I need your blood. This is how it used to be done. None of this ordering blood off the Internet nonsense. Magic shouldn\u2019t be so sanitary. It has no right to be.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d started absently stroking Greta\u2019s fur, a soothing rhythmic motion from the tips of her ears to the end of her tail. It was causing an inappropriate response, and before she could stop herself, she\u2019d shifted.</p><p>Dayne turned as fur changed to soft flesh under his hand. Greta was lying on her side, her legs curled into her, trying to cover her nudity. It was a strange and oddly endearing quirk for a Were.</p><p>Usually they flaunted whatever they had to flaunt, in their skin or in their fur.</p> <p>\u201cCould you go get me some clothes out of my bag? Please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>As he made his way down the hall, a visual came unbidden of those beautiful legs on his shoulders, and Greta moaning and writhing beneath him. He had to shake himself physically to loosen the thoughts from his mind.</p><p>If she\u2019d been a dog, no pun intended, he might not have had such a problem. His resolve with her would be melted way before the moon reached fullness. And if history was choosing to repeat itself, by the time he needed her blood he\u2019d contract a full-blown case of stupid. Dayne retrieved a pair of faded blue jeans and a T-shirt, which barely qualified as clothing.</p><p>He returned and tossed them to her, then looked away. He heard her catch the garments and bit the inside of his cheek as he listened to the fabric slide over her skin.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said.</p><p>Dayne turned. Clothing did nothing to help the situation. The jeans hugged the curves of her hips too enticingly, and the shirt was cropped to reveal a small expanse of golden stomach. Without a bra, her nipples protruded through the thin pink material.</p><p>For a moment, neither of them spoke.</p> <p>\u201cThe gardens are warded as well,\u201d Dayne said, looking for anything to say so he could stop looking at her nipples. His eyes darted up to catch hers as she nodded. Her cheeks were flushed. Who knew a werecat could blush? Jaden had been shameless.</p><p>\u201cWill you be sleeping in the guest room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to lock me up?\u201d Her eyebrows rose in challenge as the pink faded from her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have said that. I\u2019m not used to being around people. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>This was an understatement and a testament to how much the tiny creature unnerved him. Once he\u2019d had time to think, he\u2019d realized how extreme it was. All the dangerous books required extensive magical knowledge to decipher. It wasn\u2019t as if she could cast a curse on him or destroy any of the wards he\u2019d built.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to try to trust each other.\u201d He watched her lips draw into a tight line at the hypocritical comment, but she nodded again.</p><p>He wondered if she felt the room charge as he did. He wanted to shove the jeans past her hips and bend her over the bathroom counter. He wanted her in his bed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hungry,\u201d Greta said, interrupting his fantasy.</p><p>Dayne\u2019s hand, of its own accord, reached out and brushed a strand of hair off her face as she passed him. She flinched.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve said that a lot today.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t know why he\u2019d touched her. He had no right. There were no strong wizards or good witches she could go to in the city.</p><p>She must have been very desperate and afraid to come to him, and he hadn\u2019t done anything to put that fear to rest.</p><p>He followed her down the narrow hallway. A picture on the wall of his uncle Arthur reflected oddly in the domed hallway lighting. The photograph showed Arthur with a disapproving look on his stern features. The camera had never captured him without that look, not once in his 443 years of life. Nevertheless, Dayne felt the old man stood in judgment of him now beyond the grave, how far Dayne\u2019s humanity had slipped in recent decades.</p><p>Greta moved ahead of him with an animal grace, each step precise. It was difficult to understand how normal humans couldn\u2019t sense what she was. Dayne could feel the magic pulsing off her, just as intoxicating as the last time he\u2019d felt it thirty years before with Jaden.</p><p>It called to him, begged him to take a taste of that raw natural power, that elusive something trained magic users just didn\u2019t have.</p><p>A sorcerer, witch, or wizard just knew how to manipulate the magic around them; shapeshifters were made of magic.</p><p>He kept to the corners of the room, doing an old trick he\u2019d learned in his apprenticeship days to make himself fade into the background. It wasn\u2019t full invisibility, more like unobtrusiveness.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure of its effectiveness on a shapeshifter, but at least it would keep his presence from spooking her further.</p><p>He had to restrain himself as Greta took the milk from the fridge and drank it straight from the carton. At first, the restraint was because she was no doubt spreading germs all over the container.</p><p>Then it became about something else as he felt himself grow hard.</p><p>A few drops of the creamy white liquid dribbled around the sides of the carton and down her chin and long neck. She arched back, and some of the liquid dripped down to dampen her shirt.</p><p>She moved on to a steak Dayne had planned to grill for dinner the next day. He couldn\u2019t bring himself to protest as he watched her carefully unwrap the meat and make a show of eating it. A woman eating raw meat wasn\u2019t generally a turn-on. It was the kind of thing seen in a traveling freak show, but somehow the werecat managed to make an act that emphasized bloody death into the most erotic teasing.</p><p>When she\u2019d finished, she dumped the empty meat tray in the garbage and stretched her arms languidly over her head. She paused by the door on her way out of the kitchen. \u201cGoodnight, Dayne,\u201d she practically purred.</p><p>He shed the useless glamour. \u201cNice kitties don\u2019t tease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never said I was a nice kitty. Nice sorcerers don\u2019t stalk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are no nice sorcerers.\u201d</p><p>He frowned as the confidence slipped off her face like a mask.</p><p>She turned and scurried off to the guest room without a backward glance, the spell she\u2019d woven broken.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know what kind of game she was playing, but he was disappointed to be the winner.</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>VER the days that followed, a routine and tentative truce Oformed. Dayne stopped threatening Greta and tried to stop suspecting her of trying to destroy him. Mostly he suspected Jaden. He\u2019d once allowed Jaden\u2019s musical laughter and shapely ass to cause him to lose sight of everything he\u2019d learned as a sorcerer, something he was in danger of doing again now with Greta.</p><p>Jaden had been beneficial in her way. The slaughter in the tribe\u2019s sacred space had ensured the reputation he now enjoyed. It was a reputation he\u2019d cultivated and cared for like a garden full of delicate seedlings. The consolation prize for losing the girl.</p><p>Overall, it had significantly reduced the hassle in his life. Now everything was \u201cYes, Mr. Wickham,\u201d \u201cNo, Mr. Wickham,\u201d \u201cPlease don\u2019t kill me, Mr. Wickham.\u201d That suited him fine.</p><p>Whatever Jaden\u2019s plan now, Greta at least believed she needed to be saved. And he needed blood. What was it they said about a gift horse?</p><p>He\u2019d made a trip to the grocery store, stocking enough to feed an army. Weres had quite the metabolism. She could pack it away, but where she put it all, he had no idea. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It wasn\u2019t just raw meat and milk she liked. She ate cooked meat and vegetables, if baked potatoes counted as a vegetable. He was certain the nutritional value of the average baked potato was so low they should have their own food group called \u201cnutritionally deficient starches.\u201d</p><p>Dayne could watch her eat raw meat with no trouble, but when she dug into a baked potato loaded with butter and sour cream, he got squeamish. She\u2019d requested an unnatural amount of chocolate, popcorn, and ice cream, along with every werewolf film ever made.</p><p>She\u2019d insisted that if she was going to be stuck in the house, she needed entertainment.</p><p>When Dayne questioned her, she\u2019d said, \u201cHey, I don\u2019t blame them for portraying the wolves that way. All the bad press is their fault.\u201d Then she\u2019d started on another tub of popcorn.</p> <p>The next day he\u2019d caught her in the basement rolling some of his herbs in rolling paper and smoking them. Then he realized it was catnip.</p><p>He\u2019d wanted to be angry. He had a few spells he needed that for and the good stuff was expensive, but she\u2019d rolled around on the stone floor giggling like a maniac. They\u2019d had the briefest of moments when he was sure he could have gotten her into bed with no trouble, but he\u2019d let the moment pass.</p><p>Dayne lounged in a wingback chair in the den. He did most of his guilty pleasure reading here, though there were books all over the house crammed onto every bookcase and stacked on most available surfaces.</p><p>There were spell books, of course, but also books on science and history, as well as several books on gardening. He had an impressive garden encased in a stone wall. Climbing vines and roses created a magical effect over trellises, gates, and the garden wall itself. Dayne had spent many hours the past few days watching Greta in her cat form running around the garden chasing things.</p><p>Then he\u2019d grown hard as he\u2019d watched her shift and sunbathe nude, still cursing the missed catnip opportunity. She must not have realized he had a window with a view. It was easy to lose track of the possible peepholes when the garden felt so remote from everything else. It had been designed that way, though he couldn\u2019t have foretold the current benefit he was getting from it.</p> <p>The first time she'd sunbathed nude, he'd thought she was teasing him as she had with the milk and meat, but her manner was different. Unaffected. She was graceful and sultry as before, but there was an innocence that had been missing from her earlier purposeful seduction, and one he had a hard time admitting turned him on even more than the show she\u2019d put on to entice him. He still hadn\u2019t managed to determine what that had been about. Greta wasn\u2019t a seductress; it wasn\u2019t her style.</p><p>Something was off, he just couldn\u2019t figure out what.</p><p>He got up to check the window again. He was a dirty old man for peeping at her, though he couldn\u2019t very well warn Greta of the window now. It would only embarrass her and create an uneasiness he didn\u2019t want to see in her again.</p><p>Satisfied with the rationalization and disappointed to find no naked Greta outside, he went back to his chair and horror novel.</p><p>Three pages into chapter thirteen, he looked up startled to see Greta standing in the doorway with an odd glint in her eyes.</p><p>He could hear her purring from his chair. She leaned with one arm over her head to support herself, her body so relaxed and loose it looked like liquid in suspended animation. Her eyes were dilated, her lips parted.</p> <p>Damn. Dayne knew this. Her lips were parted so she could breathe in the pheromones on the air around her. She was in heat.</p><p>She\u2019d found him by scent and she wasn\u2019t going to be refused.</p><p>She slunk into the room, and it was then he noticed she was wearing one of his T-shirts and nothing else. The shirt grazed the tops of her thighs. Her nipples formed points in the fabric, making her arousal evident, in the event he\u2019d missed it before.</p><p>She\u2019d only come with a few outfits in the small duffel bag, all of them in the laundry at the moment. She stalked him, and he couldn\u2019t move. For the first time since they\u2019d met, he was her prey.</p><p>Dayne had been insane if he\u2019d thought she was dangerous to him before, back when danger was a cute theory. She let out a soft breathy sigh, and the book slipped from his hands to the floor. She bent beside the chair to pick it up, her ass raised delectably in the air. Sweet mother of God, she wasn\u2019t wearing panties.</p><p>Dayne ran a hand over her bare ass. Greta shivered and turned toward him, straightening with the grace of a preternatural dancer.</p><p>He felt pinned to the chair by a force stronger than those he usually wielded, as she arched back and peeled the shirt from her body, tossing it to the floor.</p><p>\u201cTouch me.\u201d Her voice was throaty. Whoever or whatever this was, it wasn\u2019t her.</p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s a bad idea.\u201d Why the hell was he growing a conscience now?</p><p>\u201cI have to sleep with someone now,\u201d Greta said. \u201cIf you don't do it, I\u2019ll have to find someone who will.\u201d She made her way back toward the door, her exit as much a seduction as her entrance.</p><p>Like hell, she was. \u201cYou aren\u2019t going anywhere. You promised your blood to me, and I will collect.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t seem bothered that he\u2019d reduced her to nothing more than a magical blood donor. She stood in front of him, gloriously naked and pulsing with desire, her body vibrating with the purrs he knew were more from painful need than contentedness.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she said, rubbing her breasts against him. The action was so feline she may as well have been in her fur.</p><p>Dayne gripped her by the shoulders. \u201cHow much of you is still in there? Because I promise if you regret this afterward and think you\u2019re running off, I will lock you in the cage downstairs. I\u2019m not having your heat cycle screw this up.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t phased by the threat, too lost in elevated hormones.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you want me?\u201d She pouted prettily and then turned in his arms, her ass grinding against his erection. \u201cMmmmm I see that you do.\u201d She glanced over her shoulder. \u201cWell?\u201d Dayne\u2019s hands had slid of their own accord around to her front, running smoothly over her belly and up to her exposed breasts.</p><p>\u201cAre you coherent enough to talk to me?\u201d He was in the process of losing his own powers of coherence.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t wanna talk. Wanna fuck.\u201d</p><p>He gripped her by the shoulders again and shook her. \u201cHow long does this last and how often does it happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDepends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExposure to eligible mates.\u201d She moaned. \u201cDon\u2019t stop touching.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t possibly live like this.\u201d He found it hard to believe Weres were running amuck having heat cycles and getting anything done in the real world.</p><p>\u201cI take a pill. They\u2019re in my apartment.\u201d She sped the pace of her grinding.</p><p>\u201cLike birth control?\u201d If she didn\u2019t stop that, he wasn\u2019t going to be able to continue the conversation. Not verbally anyway.</p><p>\u201cSort of. Stops the cycle. Mutes it so I can function. Please fuck me now. Talk after.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go get your prescription.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo late, won\u2019t help once it\u2019s started. Have to get them after.\u201d Against his better judgment, Dayne picked her up and carried her to his bedroom. What was he going to do? Have her rolling around all over him until the full moon? He was supposed to be evil. He was well within his rights at this point. With all he\u2019d heard about the tortures of heat without fulfillment, he was providing a service.</p><p>When they reached the bedroom, Dayne set her firmly on her feet and brushed a strand of hair from her face. She leaned into his touch. He jerked his hand away, remembering the same gesture from a few days before. This wasn\u2019t her.</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d Greta\u2019s breath came out in labored pants.</p><p>\u201cOh fuck it, I\u2019m the bad guy.\u201d</p><p>He pushed her until the backs of her legs hit the bed. Her knees bent, and she laid back, spreading her legs wide for his perusal, her earlier shyness gone. He leaned down to kiss her.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she whimpered.</p><p>The kitty didn\u2019t want foreplay. Dayne shrugged and shucked his clothes. He tossed them blindly to the corner and took in the feast in front of him. Her fingernails transformed into sharp, razored points.</p><p>\u201cScoot back up on the bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScoot back up on the bed or I\u2019ll leave you here to handle this yourself.\u201d He knew she couldn\u2019t.</p><p>She obeyed him; she probably would have walked through fire at this point. If he were more sadistic, he might have tested that theory. Instead, he went to the adjacent room, came back with rope, and tied her wrists to the bars.</p><p>\u201cFor my protection from those nasty claws of yours,\u201d he said, pointing to the healing marks on his forearm. There was no betrayal in her eyes, only raw lust as she spread her legs wider.</p><p>Tears streamed down her face.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Dayne.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. Superpowers or no, she could do nothing but submit when the heat took over.</p><p>Dayne slid inside her and felt one thing. Possession. This belonged to him. He felt it in the same primal way he felt magic when he\u2019d followed the proper formulas. Whatever she thought this was, she was going to be in his bed for a good long time if he had anything to say about it.</p><p>A symphony of emotion played over her face as her more restrained counterpart fought for control. Fear, confusion, desperation, need, and finally surrender, as that part of her lost. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She lurched off the bed as her orgasm took her, and he joined her.</p><p>Then it was over, and her face telegraphed equal parts shame and fear. Greta turned away, staring at the wallpaper as if trying to imprint the pattern on her memory.</p><p>Dayne untied her and she wrapped herself in the bedspread.</p><p>\u201cGod, what you must think,\u201d she finally said. She\u2019d been making an effort to keep her crying quiet, but it flowed out of her voice when she spoke.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking, for a quickie, that was fucking amazing. And that I\u2019m probably done with my own species. To hell with playing it safe.\u201d</p><p>He smiled at her when she turned back to him and kissed the dampness from her face.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s worse than a vampire\u2019s need for blood,\u201d she said.</p><p>Another odd quirk. Most Weres reveled in their sexual power and slept with anything they could get their hands on. It was the one reason he\u2019d trusted Jaden. When she\u2019d come to his bed when she wasn\u2019t in heat, he\u2019d believed her feeling for him was genuine.</p><p>Now he knew what it had really been about. Control.</p> <p>Her face was tense, no doubt waiting for him to say something cruel.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay now?\u201d He sat on the bed beside her, for his part unconcerned with his nudity, as he stroked her back through the bedspread.</p><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019m sorry about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelieve me, there is nothing for you to be sorry about. I\u2019m evil remember? Your petty heat cycle doesn\u2019t intimidate me.\u201d She laughed a little. \u201cIt won\u2019t happen again if you can get my pills.\u201d Greta frowned then, lines appearing in the middle of her forehead. \u201cI\u2019m sure my apartment is being watched.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can get in undetected. Will you be okay if I leave you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, go.\u201d</p> <p>The fridge door stood open as Greta debated the benefits of left-over spaghetti versus peanut butter and jelly. She finally decided on chicken nuggets from the freezer.</p><p>Over the past few days she\u2019d slowly come to trust she was safe here. The longer she was exposed to Dayne\u2019s magical signature, the more she knew the world was shown a very different Dayne Wickham than the reality. Now her unease and fear were back.</p><p>\u201cStupid, Greta,\u201d she said aloud. After the display in the kitchen, she should have known the heat cycle was close. It had been too long since she\u2019d let it go that far without the drugs that suppressed it.</p><p>Dayne returned as she finished the nuggets, carrying her pills and something else.</p><p>\u201cMrarr.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMink!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are perverse,\u201d he said.</p><p>It was only her paranoia that made Greta think he was referencing their previous joining.</p> <p>He pointed at the cat. \u201cI spent fifteen minutes trying to talk to her and get her to shift, because I was convinced a therian wouldn\u2019t have a pet of the same species they changed into. I\u2019ve never heard of such a thing. Then I realized I didn\u2019t feel any magic coming off her, just the residue in your apartment, so I brought her along.\u201d Mink was rubbing her cheek against Greta\u2019s hand and purring.</p><p>\u201cI forgot all about her because of everything,\u201d Greta said. \u201cShe could have starved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot likely. She chewed her way through the cat food bag. She could have lived off it for a month. Here.\u201d He handed Greta the prescription bottle.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She popped the pill, washing it down with milk, and sank back into the chair.</p><p>Dayne sat across from her, his eyes serious. \u201cI want us to talk.\u201d Chapter Six</p><p>think we should talk about the ritual.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIGreta let out a breath she didn\u2019t know she\u2019d been holding.</p><p>She\u2019d expected condemnation, perhaps a scarlet letter magically emblazoned across her body.</p><p>Fortunately, Dayne wasn\u2019t the Puritan she seemed to be. He\u2019d handled the heat fiasco with a surprising amount of grace and now he just wanted to get back to the business at hand. She straightened in her chair.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t asked for details about the ritual. Dayne could be planning to destroy the world and she\u2019d probably let him use her blood if it would save her hide. Maybe she was a coward, but she wanted to live. She preferred not to know the gory details in case it presented her with a moral dilemma.</p><p>\u201cWhat about it?\u201d She ran a finger through the remaining honey mustard sauce on the plate and licked it from her finger. His eyes darkened with lust and she put her hands in her lap.</p><p>What was wrong with her? She\u2019d just taken a pill. Could she not do anything without making it look like an invitation? She bit her lip, as her eyes roved over his body. Dayne was fully clothed, wearing jeans and a T-shirt featuring an obscure grunge band from the nineties.</p><p>No matter what he was wearing, she couldn\u2019t stop seeing the sharply defined muscles she knew were hidden underneath. The memory of their earlier coupling ran wild through her mind, becoming clearer each time she replayed it. And she\u2019d replayed it about fifteen times now. Her cheeks flushed, and she looked away.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think they want you? Why does it have to be you and not someone else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that ritual. It\u2019s because I was born a kitten. But I didn\u2019t know it until the other day when I overheard plans for the sacrifice.</p><p>I mean, how would I know? Not like I\u2019d remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExplain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTherians are born in human form and die in animal form.</p><p>Legends got that backward, or at least about the dying part. We don\u2019t go back to human form when we die. We go into animal form trying to survive. It\u2019s the way we heal.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s rare to be able to shift before age five or six. Even then, it\u2019s more normal to start shifting around eight. For centuries, my people have believed our powers come from the gods. So when the gods bless someone as a proper sacrifice, meaning they allow them to be born in their fur, they must be sacrificed on the first full moon of their twenty-eighth year when their power is strongest. But I always thought it was a myth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>Greta tried to keep the hurt off her face that he wasn\u2019t outraged on her behalf, or sweeping her up into his arms. The heat was screwing with her emotions. \u201cIs that all you needed to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor now.\u201d</p><p>Greta got up and rinsed her plate in the sink. \u201cI\u2019m going to bed then.\u201d</p><p>The sex hadn\u2019t meant anything. It was the stupid heat. She couldn\u2019t expect him to be in love with her, and it wasn\u2019t like she was in love with him either. She needed to get a grip.</p><p>It was after midnight and Dayne was propped against the headboard of his bed making notations for the ritual. It made sense now why the drawings and photographs had been in human form.</p><p>They sought a full reversal of the natural order. It was poetic in its way, if not morbid in its poetry. If she\u2019d been born in cat form, her blood was more potent than most.</p><p>The kind of power released from blood like that on such a ritually significant date . . . He could see why therians believed it caused the gods to bless them. That much overflow with the right ritual, her essence was bound to be absorbed. Whether they were aware of it or not, they weren\u2019t so much keeping in the good graces of the gods as they were stealing her power. If he\u2019d wanted to live up to his reputation, he should be bottling her blood and selling it on the black market.</p><p>From a practical standpoint, it meant he\u2019d need less blood than he would from a normal therian on just any full moon. Without that crucial knowledge, he could have had a magical boo-boo of pyrotechnic proportions.</p><p>His personal grimoire was propped open on his lap. He was penciling in the amount of blood he\u2019d need, when he heard an unearthly howl. Moments later, a bundle of black fur shot across his floor and into the bed. She\u2019d burrowed halfway under the covers before he could get to her.</p><p>\u201cGreta, calm down.\u201d</p><p>Her fur stood on end, and she was digging her claws into his 800 thread count sheets, digging clear into the mattress. She looked past him, seeing something that wasn\u2019t there. Then a pitiful crying meow tore through her throat. His chest tightened, and a rush of compassion overwhelmed him for the frightened animal.</p><p>\u201cGreta, look at me. You had a nightmare. There\u2019s nothing here.\u201d The part of her that could understand human speech had obviously receded, drawn back into the cat-shaped shell. Dayne gently stroked down her back, speaking soothing nonsense.</p><p>Gradually, the tiny talons receded back into her paws and her fur laid flat. His fingers smoothed over her until a rumbling purr started and this time he watched as she transformed back to her human form.</p><p>Their eyes met as he continued his ministrations over her silken skin. She rolled over onto her back, stretching her arms over her head as his fingers played over her breasts. He watched her reaction, half expecting her to pull away or recover her earlier modesty.</p><p>She let out a soft sigh; her eyes glazed over. He replaced his hand with his mouth, licking and teasing over the nipple of one breast as his hand moved farther south to pet her sex.</p><p>\u201cDayne,\u201d she panted.</p><p>He released her breast to give her his full attention. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if we should.\u201d</p><p>A finger dipped inside her, and she bucked off the bed. A purr emanated from her chest as she whimpered and pushed against his hand, urging his finger deeper. He withdrew it.</p><p>\u201cWell, if you don\u2019t think we should.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He smiled down at her and watched the angry spark flare in her eyes, then die away as she caught his grin and realized he didn\u2019t intend to kick her out of his bed.</p><p>He chuckled and moved down her body to swipe his tongue over the flesh where his hand had been. She moaned and dug her hands into the sheets. He wondered if between her cat side and her human side if there would be any sheets left by the time he was finished with her.</p><p>Greta was in Dayne\u2019s bed, wrapped in his arms for the second time that night. She wished she could stop the contented purring.</p><p>The pills had stalled the immediate need of the heat, but the adrenaline from her fear had caused her to weaken when his hands were on her.</p> <p>His fingers stroked through her hair and trailed down her back as she arched into his touch. Like most cats, she was never able to get enough.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to tell me about the nightmare?\u201d Greta stiffened. She\u2019d forgotten the dream. She hadn\u2019t been human enough to retain the memories. Already in her cat form and in such a primal panic, all sense of humanity had left her. She wasn\u2019t usually so disconnected from her human thoughts, even in her fur. If she\u2019d remembered the details of what had gotten her so scared in the first place, she wouldn\u2019t have run into Dayne\u2019s room.</p><p>She shuddered as the dream came rushing back in its full Technicolor ugliness.</p><p>\u201cI just dreamed about the sacrifice. They took me and were draining my blood out. I was dying. That\u2019s all.\u201d She couldn\u2019t tell him she\u2019d dreamed he\u2019d stood there and let it happen, that he\u2019d been in on it from the beginning.</p><p>She\u2019d run to him thinking he would protect her, but the tribe had sent her to him to ensure she\u2019d be at the ritual. In the dream, Dayne was the one who made the cuts down her skin and smiled as the blood ran out.</p> <p>She hadn\u2019t smelled any evil on him, not once she\u2019d gotten past the persona he was trying to live up to. But then sorcerers could mask their scent with magic. Jaden had taught her that. She pulled out of his arms and reached for the shirt she\u2019d dropped on the floor before their first coupling.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m going back to my room,\u201d she said, unable to make eye contact. She couldn\u2019t let him see her fear.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure? Maybe you should sleep here, in case you dream again.\u201d</p><p>Greta was already edging toward the door when she looked up at him.</p><p>Dayne\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cYou\u2019re right; perhaps you should sleep in your own room. You\u2019re only here a few more days.\u201d It wasn\u2019t as if she\u2019d said she wanted a relationship. She hadn\u2019t even implied it. The first time she\u2019d been in heat, and the second he\u2019d initiated. He had some ego. Or was his comment because he knew she\u2019d be dead? Greta crossed back to her room and crawled in under the covers with Mink. This time she slept with her door locked.</p><p>Dayne sighed. It wasn\u2019t necessary to overreact like that. Her wanting to sleep across the hall didn\u2019t mean she was using him.</p> <p>The truth spell he\u2019d cast wasn\u2019t for short-term use. He could have done that without her blood. He\u2019d instead wanted something longer lasting, an insurance policy to protect his interests in the event that he got too soft-hearted toward her and started doing all his thinking with little Dayne.</p><p>Her aura had turned dark when he\u2019d asked her about the dream. She was holding something back. He could make her tell him, but then he was back to being classed as a monster. He didn\u2019t like the way it made him feel when he was the source of her fear.</p><p>He liked even less that he cared so much what this particular therian thought, period. It would be best if she slept in her own room. If he didn\u2019t get attached, neither Greta nor Jaden could lure him into another trap.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>RETA perched on a kitchen barstool with a plate of bacon Gand scrambled eggs covered in maple syrup. Her long tanned legs were crossed, flip-flops dangling off her feet. Mink stood on the counter eating off the side of her plate.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s disgusting,\u201d Dayne said. She wasn\u2019t sure if he was referring to her habit of eating maple syrup on her eggs, or sharing food with the cat. Mink hopped off the counter and fled to the other side of the room.</p><p>Dayne poured a glass of juice and took a packet of instant muffin mix from the cabinet. Greta tensed as he brushed past her to retrieve a bowl, muffin tin, milk, and a measuring cup. He took a chocolate cookie out of the cookie jar and chomped on it as he worked. A stubborn crumb stayed on the corner of his mouth, and Greta wanted to lick it off.</p><p>She was slowly losing her mind. He was dangerous. Probably.</p> <p>He was part of the ritual. Maybe. She wasn\u2019t sure anymore. In the daylight it didn\u2019t seem possible he\u2019d do that to her. Two nights before she\u2019d dreamed purple clowns were chasing her down an alley made of Swiss cheese. Some dreams were just dreams.</p><p>\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d Dayne preheated the oven and was engaged in pouring the batter into the muffin tin.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you doing that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoing what?\u201d</p><p>She gestured to the batter. \u201cCan\u2019t you just zap them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly an amateur magic user uses a spell for such a petty thing.\u201d He sounded like he was reciting from a textbook.</p><p>Greta spun on the bar stool, first one way, then the other. Something she hadn\u2019t done since she was a kid at Simon\u2019s house. She wanted blueberry muffins. It was getting close to the full moon and she was still hungry. But Dayne made her skin itch, and the kitchen was suddenly too hot and confining.</p><p>Her eyes cut to the doorway to see Mink slipping out of the room. In a minute, the cat would be back, whining to be let out.</p><p>Greta left her plate on the counter and, without a word, followed after her.</p><p>Dayne took the blueberry muffins from the oven and dropped the tray. Dammit. Was he developing some type of mental retardation? She\u2019d deflected his question about what was wrong by asking why he didn\u2019t use magic to make muffins. She had a point there.</p><p>And since when did he start eating instant blueberry muffins and chocolate cookies? Her poor eating habits were beginning to rub off on him. He never should have sprung for the cookie jar. All those simple carbs.</p><p>He was going to have to resort to magic to stay in shape if he kept eating like this. Only two more days, then she was on her own and he was back to the regimented diet. He plucked one of the muffins from the tray and ate it anyway, then went to look for her.</p><p>Whatever was causing her anxiety needed to be resolved, at least reduced. Otherwise, it could affect the ritual.</p><p>He found her in the garden.</p><p>\u201cGreta . . . \u201d</p><p>She shrieked and covered herself with one of his bright fluffy beach towels. Dayne looked away, his hand over his eyes.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cGive me a second. Okay. I\u2019m decent.\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t been kidding about a second. She could put clothing on as fast as most people could take it off. Dayne wondered if she was holding out on him about her magical abilities.</p><p>As to her decency, that was a matter of perspective. \u201cYou avoided my question earlier in the kitchen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d She sat on the ground and picked a daisy, tearing the petals off one by one. Her eyes followed each petal as it fell onto her shorts, and the warm breeze carried it away.</p><p>\u201cI asked you if something was wrong.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him, her eyes guileless. \u201cWrong? No. Why would something be wrong?\u201d</p><p>Dayne felt his face darken at the same time Greta\u2019s aura did.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lying.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged and picked another daisy. He felt the tension roll over her as her eyes flashed to gold and then back to brown so fast it could have been a trick of the light.</p><p>He sat on the grass a few feet away and uprooted a daisy, starting on the same mindless ritual Greta was focused on. When she looked up at him, her shoulders relaxed.</p><p>He sighed. \u201cWhat are you afraid of? You know they can\u2019t get to you, not even in the garden. You\u2019ve been safe here the entire time, and the clock is running out. You\u2019re useless to them after tomorrow night.\u201d</p><p>He reached out and settled a hand on her knee. \u201cAre you afraid of me?\u201d</p><p>Greta\u2019s wide eyes rose to his. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it because of the way I behaved when you first got here? Or anything we\u2019ve done since then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m not afraid of you.\u201d</p><p>He watched as her eyes drifted to his hand, then away, then back again, but she didn\u2019t ask him to remove it. He laid his other hand against her cheek.</p><p>\u201cYou really are safe with me.\u201d</p><p>She rubbed her cheek against his palm and scooted to close the distance between them. Her mouth latched onto his. He returned the kiss; his hand settled on the back of her neck holding her firmly in place while his tongue explored.</p><p>In the next moment, she\u2019d scrambled off him.</p><p>\u201cGreta, what?\u201d He touched a finger to his lips.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need to be starting something up with someone who may or may not be evil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho said we were starting anything up?\u201d Her face flushed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I forgot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForgot what?\u201d He didn\u2019t know what she was apologizing for until he saw the signs of the heat.</p><p>\u201cI was supposed to take it after breakfast. And then you came in and distracted me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right. I understand this. I don\u2019t think badly of you. Let me help you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She held a warning finger out to him as she struggled to her feet. \u201cYou stay the hell away from me.\u201d</p><p>He edged nearer. \u201cYou are afraid of me.\u201d Greta didn\u2019t trust herself to speak. She needed him now. Her body sought his. After the first day, he\u2019d been nothing but kind to her. Never raising his voice, never grabbing or threatening her.</p><p>He\u2019d gone shopping for her; he\u2019d done everything right. Dreams were often a jumbled mixture of all the things people experience, desire, and fear. It made sense Dayne would get jumbled in too.</p><p>She had no illusions he wanted to keep her around, and she didn\u2019t want to sleep with him again if it was going to be just another meaningless ritual biology had set up as a physical act with no feeling. If she was going to be physical with someone, she wanted the feelings that came with it. She wanted him to care.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not afraid of you.\u201d</p><p>He cocked his head to the side looking past her, and she wondered what had caused the confused expression to come to his face.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re conflicted,\u201d he said after a moment.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not conflicted. I just want control of my own damn body.\u201d Her voice quivered more than she liked. She darted behind a row of hedges and passed through the gate before detouring to her room. She shut and locked the door.</p><p>Moments later there was a quiet knock.</p> <p>Greta\u2019s need flowed through her. It thrashed about like a live wire demanding satisfaction. The arousal was so strong it was becoming painful. A rumbling purr started in her chest, trying to soothe it away. She needed him inside her now.</p><p>\u201cGreta, let me help you. You can\u2019t make it until tomorrow,\u201d Dayne said reasonably from the other side of the door.</p><p>She sat on the edge of the bed, her nails digging into the sheets, rending long tears in them. Dayne didn\u2019t seem conflicted at all.</p><p>Greta was glad at least one of them wasn\u2019t suffering from that problem.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to frighten you. I don\u2019t want to open the door with magic. But I\u2019m not sure I can stay out here and listen to you howl like that.\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t realized she\u2019d been making vocalizations. Sounds that could be either pleasure or pain. At this point, even she couldn\u2019t decipher the tangled web of sensations running through her. She left the bed without conscious thought and crawled to the door. Her fingernails dug into the wood as she pressed her ear to the flat panel listening to him while he spoke soft words of reassurance. She panted as she breathed in his scent.</p> <p>Greta ripped the clothes from her body. The room was becoming too hot. She couldn\u2019t think. A horrible sound tore from her throat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming through the door if you don\u2019t open it.\u201d</p><p>She wanted him to. Anything so she wouldn\u2019t have to make the choice to throw herself at him. Let him be the one on a conquest, not her.</p><p>\u201cGreta.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t form a thought that would translate itself into a sentence. The only words that wanted to work their way through her brain were, \u201cPlease fuck me now.\u201d She knew he was more than willing to oblige. All she had to do was move a few inches, and unlock the door. One tiny little turn.</p><p>Her hand reached out, and she pulled it away, biting her bottom lip.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m counting down, and then I\u2019m opening the door. Ten . . .</p><p>nine . . . eight . . . seven . . . six . . . five . . . \u201d She unlocked the door.</p> <p>\u201c . . . four . . . three . . . two . . . \u201d She opened the door.</p><p>Dayne\u2019s clothes had already been stripped off. She wanted to say he\u2019d been presumptuous, but large words like presumptuous couldn\u2019t be processed in her near feral state. She pounced on him and wrapped her legs around his waist.</p><p>He walked them backward to the bed. \u201cI\u2019m never buying Egyptian cotton sheets again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she breathed. They both knew she wasn\u2019t asking for sheets.</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>RETA\u2019S eyes shot open. Her heart palpitated wildly, Gthrumming through her chest. Blood pounded in her ears.</p><p>Dayne\u2019s arm was slung over her hip, hugging her naked body loosely against him. Why hadn\u2019t she shifted? She\u2019d had the dream again, this time more vivid than before. Yet, despite her fear, she\u2019d held onto her human form.</p><p>She wanted to stay wrapped in Dayne\u2019s warmth forever, but she forced herself to move. He was the face of her death; there were no doubts now. Getting the same dream twice wasn\u2019t something she could ignore. It was prophetic. Dayne was the one holding the ritual knife that spilled her blood.</p><p>She twisted and shimmied out from under him. His arm fell with a sharp oomph much louder than it should have been. Was her hearing getting better?</p><p>He rolled to his other side with a grunt, and Greta eased out of the bed. She grabbed her duffel bag from the corner, and made her way to the kitchen for her pills.</p><p>She didn\u2019t need crazy lust while trying to survive. It had already inconvenienced her twice. Now her heart hurt to leave the man she kept finding herself in bed with. Stupid fucking heat cycle. Her body and heart were convinced he was the guy for her, but her brain knew better.</p><p>She felt a pang of regret at breaking her agreement, then her brain kicked back in as she remembered his plan had been to get her blood at the full moon. And to kill her doing it. No, she didn\u2019t feel bad leaving. Besides, she\u2019d slept with him. To men of Dayne\u2019s reputation that was probably considered payment in full.</p><p>She wondered how he\u2019d struck the deal with her tribe. Jaden wouldn\u2019t send her to a sorcerer if she cared about her. Duh, Greta.</p><p>And the story Dayne had concocted about Jaden betraying him?</p><p>Way to shine the light away. Gullible. It wasn\u2019t a lesson she\u2019d be forgetting anytime soon. Assuming she survived her birth moon.</p><p>She crept to the kitchen, wincing when the hardwood floor creaked beneath her feet. She stopped and held her breath as she waited to see if it would wake Dayne. The house remained silent with only the ticking of the clock over the fireplace mantle breaking the stillness.</p><p>\u201cMrarrr.\u201d</p><p>She jumped as Mink padded in, weaving her body between Greta\u2019s legs. \u201cShhh! Do you want him to wake up and come in here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrarrr?\u201d</p><p>Greta smiled sadly down at the orange tabby. She\u2019d have to leave Mink behind. Covert ops were clearly lost on the talkative cat.</p><p>She rummaged in the fridge until she found a slice of ham and dropped it on the floor, hoping it would shut the cat up. She poured herself a glass of water, gulped down a pill, then slipped the prescription into her pocket and took one last look around.</p><p>Tears teased the corners of her eyes. She wished Dayne hadn\u2019t turned out to be evil. She could have imagined living here with him in his quiet cottage in the woods. It felt comfortable, like home.</p><p>\u201cWhere do you think you\u2019re going?\u201d</p><p>Her hand had been on the knob. So close. \u201cNowhere. Outside for some air.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe garden is protected; the front stoop is not. You know it\u2019s not safe out there.\u201d</p><p>She turned toward him, and her mouth went dry. He was dressed in navy silk lounging pants and no shirt. He had the kind of body college students sketched in art classes everywhere. So warm and beautiful. And he and Greta fit together perfectly, in the carnal way. She wanted to run into his arms. Her knowledge of his betrayal wasn\u2019t enough for a body that still trusted him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not safe in here either,\u201d she said after a beat.</p><p>Dayne incanted something in Latin, and Greta felt the magic swirl up as the deadbolt turned. She pressed herself against the door as if somehow it would bend to her will and unlock. This was normally when she shifted. The edges of wildness intruded on her senses, but even stronger was her own will pressing back, for once choosing not to change.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she whispered as he moved closer. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to kill me. Whatever you need my blood for, you can have it. You know that.\u201d</p><p>His brows drew together. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>She wondered which would be faster, her enhanced strength, or his magic.</p><p>He embraced her, then pulled back to look into her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m not going to hurt you. What exactly is going on in that head of yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop lying to me!\u201d Greta shoved him with all her strength, and he went flying back, confirming her theory that he was only human with a few fancy language upgrades.</p><p>He opened his mouth to even the odds, and she flew at him, punching and clawing. With one last burst of energy, Greta slammed his head against the wall. Dayne crumbled to the floor, and the door lock fell open, withdrawing its simple magic now that the spell caster was unconscious.</p><p>She ran into the night, her eyes adjusted, and she fought the urge to shift. No fur. No paws. The trees were coming toward her too fast. She\u2019d never run like this on two legs before, but her reflexes came to her rescue, causing her to zigzag through the woods without even a branch snagging her top.</p><p>When she\u2019d put a few miles between herself and Dayne, she slowed her pace. Time to strategize. Think. The tribe wouldn\u2019t be looking for her; they\u2019d just expect Dayne had her, keeping her safe until it was time for the sacrifice.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure how long he\u2019d stay unconscious. She might be able to make it out of the city and take shelter with a wizard. Unlike sorcerers, wizards could be trusted. Too bad there weren\u2019t any within Cary Town city limits. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Before, she wouldn\u2019t have considered involving a human; it was too risky. But she\u2019d run out of options. At the main road, she hailed a taxi.</p><p>\u201c633 Oak Circle.\u201d</p><p>The driver gave her an appreciative once-over. Greta smiled, glad she\u2019d remembered her pill. Though the heat would have to be pretty bad for this guy to inspire her lust. He had a scruffy beard and was wearing flannel, for God\u2019s sake. Mother Nature could only take one so far.</p><p>\u201cHere we are,\u201d he said unnecessarily when they pulled up to Charlee\u2019s house.</p> <p>\u201cThanks. Could you wait while I go get some money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tryin\u2019 to stiff me, sweetheart?\u201d His voice held a touch of menace and some darker violent part of Greta itched to do damage.</p><p>Instead, she took a breath to steady herself.</p><p>\u201cJust. Wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, but if you aren\u2019t out in five minutes, I\u2019m comin\u2019 after you.\u201d</p> <p>Greta\u2019s eyes glowed golden, and she hissed. She didn\u2019t have time for this crap.</p><p>His hands shot up in surrender. \u201cTake all the time you need, baby.\u201d</p><p>Greta knocked for a full two minutes before a bleary-eyed Charlee opened the door, her red curly hair askew.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need money for the cab first.\u201d</p><p>Charlee went and got her purse. When the taxi rolled away, she asked again.</p> <p>\u201cI need you to smuggle me out of the city.\u201d Confusion marred Charlee\u2019s face. \u201cHuh? Just drive away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. I know this is going to sound weird, but you were on board with the cat thing and the sorcerer thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t that work out?\u201d Charlee tied the belt around her bathrobe and led Greta inside.</p><p>\u201cIt was just a way to keep me in a holding cell, so no one in the tribe against this could warn me or help me escape.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo tell me again why you can\u2019t just drive out of the city.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know the toll booths on all the major exit roads?\u201d Charlee nodded.</p><p>\u201cPreternatural border guards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not just take the back roads? There aren\u2019t any tolls there.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere are wards to keep therians from crossing. The toll roads exist because there are exemptions. And some species can pass at will, like vampires. Therians have to have permission to leave and when they do, they can go through the toll roads and present paperwork.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy therians?\u201d</p><p>Greta sighed. \u201cI can appreciate your curiosity, but I don\u2019t have time to get into therian politics right now.\u201d Ten minutes later she was in the trunk, blankets wrapped tightly around her, with an opening in the top to breathe through.</p><p>The blankets served to dampen her magical signature. With any luck, the guards wouldn\u2019t sense it.</p><p>Charlee\u2019s gray Honda Civic rolled to a stop.</p><p>The tollbooth guy\u2019s voice rumbled just outside, asking to see ID.</p><p>Greta tried to remain calm. It could be a routine check, though she had no idea why the preternatural border patrol would do something so obviously sinister if they weren\u2019t sure they had someone trying to cross the border. If it was a false alarm they\u2019d have to call in a vampire to do a memory wipe, and vamps hated being bothered during their prime hunting hours.</p><p>\u201cCharlotte Devlin?\u201d The guard asked.</p><p>\u201cY . . . yes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you wouldn\u2019t mind, we\u2019d like you to open the trunk.\u201d Shit. Greta began frantically clawing through the layers of fabric.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t authorized to search this vehicle.\u201d Love her heart, Charlee thought she was still operating in a human world with democratic rules.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t remember about your rights being ignored in the morning,\u201d he said. \u201cNow open the trunk before this has to get ugly.\u201d</p><p>Greta heard the key turn in the lock; the trunk was flung open.</p><p>She was poised and ready to jump. Her claws dug into the guard\u2019s cheek as she leaped off him. He yelped and cursed into his walkie-talkie for backup.</p><p>She was panting as she ran, desperate to put as much distance between herself and whoever the guard was calling, unsure which road might lead her to some temporary haven of safety. Finally, she spotted an open window. Someone without air conditioning had left their window open a few inches, only a screen protecting them from burglars. She wondered how such people didn\u2019t end up in ditches and on the six o\u2019clock news.</p><p>Greta ripped the screen with her claws and hopped inside. She crept into a bedroom to search through the closet, careful not to wake the middle-aged woman snoring loudly in the bed. Greta\u2019s nose wrinkled in distaste at the clothes she had to choose from. The woman was twice her size and had a large collection of dresses with big flowers printed on them. The colors were bright and spanned the entire spectrum of the rainbow. She sighed and put one on.</p><p>Sticking to the shadows, she crept outside and paused in an alley behind a dumpster to catch her breath. A gloved hand covered her mouth. She struggled, but it was one of the tribe, someone stronger than her.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t scream,\u201d Simon whispered. Greta\u2019s eyes widened as they caught something bright and silvery reflected in the streetlight. A hypodermic needle poised over the vein in her throat. Then the world went away.</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>AYNE woke to a pounding he was sure was coming from Dthe inside of his skull until he opened his eyes and realized it was the door. His fingertips skimmed over the bump Greta had left. Jesus Christ, she\u2019d gone insane on him. He couldn\u2019t figure out why she\u2019d thought he planned to kill her. Surely, the last activity they\u2019d been engaged in together wouldn\u2019t lead her to that conclusion.</p><p>He crossed the room in three strides and threw the door open.</p><p>His expression changed from hope to anger. \u201cYou\u2019re taking your life in your own hands by being here. You\u2019re lucky I didn\u2019t kill you that night.\u201d</p><p>The ward on the door dissolved, and Jaden glided past him into the house. She was dressed for a night on the town in a long backless black gown with a slit up one side, and strappy black heels that in another time and place would have made his mouth water in anticipation.</p><p>\u201cYou never could have killed me.\u201d</p><p>Dayne wrapped his hand around her throat. \u201cCare to make a wager?\u201d</p><p>Jaden pushed him off her with ease and rolled her eyes. \u201cAs fun as this is, I\u2019m not here to rekindle our old affair. Greta got captured.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is so unbelievably transparent. My IQ might have dropped several points the first time you rolled in playing the temptress, but I\u2019ve grown as a person since then.\u201d Jaden smirked. \u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think she\u2019s perfectly safe. And if she isn\u2019t, what do I care?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, indeed.\u201d She shrugged and stretched out on Dayne\u2019s couch. \u201cIt\u2019s your call. But she\u2019ll be sacrificed as soon as the sun sets.\u201d</p><p>Dayne was momentarily stunned by the sunlight streaming through the windows. He shook his head and pointed at the door.</p><p>\u201cLeave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you care for her. Help me.\u201d</p><p>He was annoyed by how well she could still read him. \u201cWhy would you give her my address in the first place?\u201d Jaden looked at the ground, the confident facade falling around her feet. \u201cBecause I knew you could keep her safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t think sending her here might endanger her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not in your nature to harm an innocent. You know you never felt that way about me.\u201d</p><p>One side of Dayne\u2019s mouth inched up in a grin. \u201cBecause you weren\u2019t, in fact, an innocent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue enough.\u201d Jaden withdrew a thin lady\u2019s cigarette out of a red leather pouch and placed it between her lips. Her eyes remained on his as she lit the tip and inhaled the nicotine.</p><p>Playing the seductress had become her full-time role, Dayne mused. She didn\u2019t seem aware she was doing it. Or if she was, she was barking up the wrong tree. She\u2019d folded her legs up underneath her, and now she unfolded them, crossing them primly, allowing one thigh to peek out of the dress.</p><p>Goddammit. He was going to let Jaden lead him into a trap again.</p><p>This time he was killing her. The shapeshifter was far too dangerous to be left alive.</p><p>\u201cVery well,\u201d Dayne said, finally. \u201cI\u2019m sure Greta shed some fur around the house.\u201d He\u2019d need it for the spell to find her. \u201cAnd Jaden, if this is a double-cross like the last time, you die. Don\u2019t expect old sentiments to keep you safe. If you\u2019re fucking with me this is your last chance to leave quietly.\u201d Jaden was already looking for cat fur.</p><p>\u201cWakey. Wakey.\u201d</p><p>Greta opened her eyes to see Simon grinning down at her. She was in a steel cage, with barely enough room to turn around. Her wrists were tied in front of her with coarse rope.</p><p>She looked down to find herself dressed in a flowing white gown, right out of a Cleopatra movie. She would have felt somewhat ridiculous if it weren\u2019t for the mind numbing fear.</p><p>Even with her new level of control, she should have shifted by now. But she knew she\u2019d never shift again. Greta mourned the loss of the grass and the hunt and the stars that used to blur overhead as she ran. She felt sluggish as the drugs flowed through her veins, dampening everything. Her keen sense of smell, vision, hearing, her ability to scent emotions. It was all gone. She felt . . . human. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She\u2019d spent a great deal of time passing for human, spending more time with them than her own tribe. Trying to blend. She no longer wanted to blend; she just wanted her powers back. A tear slid down her cheek.</p><p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t cry. You won\u2019t be pretty for the sacrifice. No one wants running mascara in a sacrifice. Least of all, me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe gods won\u2019t honor this.\u201d</p><p>Simon laughed, less a villain laugh and more a that\u2019s the funniest joke I\u2019ve heard in ages laugh. \u201cYou\u2019re adorably naive, Greta. There are no gods.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen, why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want Dayne dead. I\u2019ve been studying magic for ages. Your power will allow me to defeat him. Then I can run this town with no threat of challenge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept for the wolves.\u201d They were notoriously hard to keep in line.</p><p>He waved a hand in dismissal, \u201cThe wolves will be dealt with.\u201d A sick feeling lodged in her stomach. \u201cI thought Dayne was involved with the ritual.\u201d</p><p>Again Simon laughed. \u201cI think he played that rep of his a little too well. You couldn\u2019t even trust your own senses. I sent you the dreams. \u201d</p> <p>She knew Simon and Jaden had tried to be subtle about their love affair while Greta was growing up. But they hadn't been subtle enough. She\u2019d grown up thinking of him as her step dad.</p><p>If Jaden had once slept with Dayne to lure him into a trap set by Simon and the tribe, she could see where he might never let that drop. Even if it had been his idea. She\u2019d been born soon enough after; she\u2019d become the new plan. She didn\u2019t have to ask if Simon had killed her real mother.</p><p>\u201cIf you do this, it\u2019ll make you insane. We can\u2019t wield magic like they can. What\u2019s the point of having power if you lose your mind?\u201d Greta said.</p><p>\u201cMaybe. Maybe I\u2019m already there. Slowly draining the blood out of my daughter doesn\u2019t sound like rational behavior to me, does it you?\u201d</p><p>She looked stricken. \u201cYou can\u2019t be my father.\u201d An image of Darth Vader burst into her head. At any other time, it would have been funny.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d submit to a DNA test, but I\u2019m sure you can appreciate the time crunch I\u2019m on. Jaden couldn\u2019t reproduce and I wanted an heir.</p> <p>I figured it was tit for tat as these things go anyway. I wanted a boy, but you more than made up for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo? Then how would I know the circumstances of your birth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell the rest of the tribe what you\u2019re doing. They won\u2019t participate in this stupid vendetta against Dayne.\u201d Simon sighed and shook his head in fatherly disapproval. \u201cYou should feel privileged to give your life to make the tribe strong.</p><p>Now be a good kitty, and open up.\u201d</p><p>He reached through the bars to shove a gag into her mouth, snapping the leather straps closed behind her head. He stepped back to admire his handiwork.</p><p>\u201cNow only we know our secret.\u201d Simon held an index finger up to his lips and smiled.</p><p>\u201cMmhmmhhmpphr.\u201d Greta\u2019s scream was muffled behind the gag. She struggled against the ropes.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s time.\u201d</p><p>Simon picked up the handle attached to the base and rolled the cage to the door. The wheels squeaked under her. One was uneven, and she lost her equilibrium as Simon increased the pace. She knew he felt the moon rising.</p><p>Greta no longer could. Suddenly, losing the feel of the moon was all she could think about. The way her skin always felt warm when the moon rose, as if it were sunlight.</p><p>The fluorescent lights blinked on and off as the cage bumped down the nondescript hallways until finally they reached a door with a red exit sign over it. The sign flickered with a little electric buzz, and Greta realized it was Simon. Power already rolled off him, competing with the electricity for dominance.</p><p>Behind the warehouse was an open field surrounded by trees. In the middle of the clearing a large ritual circle had been formed with wooden logs. The small tribe stood reverently outside the circle, wearing identical long black cloaks. Beneath the cloaks, Greta knew they were all naked. This was what they wore when they shifted together.</p><p>The tribe was just twelve members strong now. In the glory days, it had been well over thirty. Jaden wasn\u2019t among them.</p><p>A crude concrete slab stood in the center of the circle. It had been built for the occasion with large steel chains bolted into it.</p><p>Simon rolled the cage to just outside the circle and produced a key from his pocket.</p><p>Another therian appeared out of the darkness to help. As if Greta could fight one of them with only human strength. How could humans stand to be so weak?</p><p>She struggled against them as they half dragged, half carried her to the stone slab, so much like the one in her dream. Except, she\u2019d dreamed of the wrong executioner. She tried screaming again. Simon was a lost cause, but maybe the other therian.</p><p>His name was Benjamin. She\u2019d grown up with him; they\u2019d played together. He wouldn\u2019t do this to her. Surely, he had to see this was wrong. The gods didn\u2019t deserve worship if they wanted this. Her eyes pleaded with Benjamin, but he looked away as he took a knife from his pocket and cut the ropes off her wrists.</p><p>They hauled her onto the stone slab, and the wind rushed out of her as the last possibility of escape was ripped away with the locking of the chains. It was so loud it was as if her preternatural senses had come flooding back in a rush of self-preservation. But then the sudden sense clarity faded back to the dull, drugged feeling, and another tear rolled down her cheek.</p><p>Benjamin stood stiffly to the side, still averting his eyes from her. If what was left of the tribe banded together, they could take Simon out. But none of them was brave enough to face down their bully. No one was stepping forward to save her.</p><p>Four therians came up around the outside edges of the circle, each holding a flaming torch to light the wood that formed the ritual space.</p><p>Greta\u2019s world narrowed, alone inside the circle of flames with Simon. The members of the tribe shifted and horrifying howls, like cats in heat, lifted up into the night. She could see their glowing eyes through the flames as they prowled around the edges of the circle, keeping up those horrible half-growls, half-meows.</p><p>Simon stood at the foot of the slab, holding the golden ritual knife up to the sky. The knife had been used in full moon rituals her whole life. Consecrated, sacred, and blessed, about to be defamed by the unholy spilling of her blood for a power-crazed Were.</p><p>\u201cBless this sacrifice and increase my territory,\u201d Simon said, with the knife raised in a mockery of sanctity.</p><p>He made long shallow cuts in her flesh. She wasn\u2019t sure what had been in the syringe, but whatever it was numbed the pain.</p><p>How long would it take? How long before she felt her life slip away like in the dream? All at once, the howling stopped as one by one the therians worked to reclaim their human forms.</p><p>Naked men and women struggled and scuffled outside the circle of flames like grotesque shadow puppets. Greta watched the bodies drop, and then one solitary therian stood still in fur, golden cat eyes staring through the flames, before backing up and taking a running leap over the wall of fire. Her claws dug into Simon\u2019s back as she growled.</p><p>It took a second for Greta to realize it was Jaden. Simon grabbed her and tossed her out of the circle. The next shape that came barreling through the fire was human.</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>HE two combatants rolled on the ground, grappling like high Tschool wrestlers. Either Greta was having hallucinations of what she wished would happen in her last moments, or Dayne had done something to enhance his strength. The two men rolled toward the flames, then away again. Simon caught fire, and they rolled together to dampen it.</p><p>Suddenly, Dayne flew back. Simon\u2019s hand was held out in front of him, and green energy crackled from his fingertips. He wiped a bloody nose with his other hand.</p><p>Dayne\u2019s lip was cut, but he chuckled. \u201cLearned a few tricks since our last meeting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cComing to save the girl, Dayne? You really are pathetic. You should trade up for some shiny armor. I could give you mine if you\u2019d like. It\u2019s just collecting rust at my house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here for my blood. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>Simon shrugged. \u201cWell there\u2019s plenty of it.\u201d He gestured toward Greta. She\u2019d become listless, no longer struggling, as the blood flowed out of her into the moat around the altar. She was using all her energy and focus just to remain conscious and aware. The voices around her sounded like they were under water.</p><p>\u201cWell? Aren\u2019t you going to take it?\u201d Simon asked.</p><p>\u201cYou know it doesn\u2019t work that way. Another ritual is already in place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to have to ask you to leave my circle,\u201d Simon said.</p><p>\u201cIf you stay, you might get some of the power, and then I won\u2019t have an unfair advantage later when I come to kill you.\u201d Dayne threw a handful of herbs at Simon and raised his arms.</p><p>He shouted an incantation that caused a band of light to wrap around Simon, effectively binding him.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t save her,\u201d Simon said. \u201cShe can\u2019t shift forms to heal.</p><p>By the time the drugs are out of her system it\u2019ll be too late.\u201d Dayne raised his arms again and looked up, shouting an invocation. The sky opened, and rain poured down. Greta closed her eyes against the downpour and shivered, her teeth clattering. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGreat plan there, hero. She can die of a chill and blood loss,\u201d Simon taunted from the bubble that trapped him. His inability to move didn\u2019t extend to his lips.</p><p>\u201cI should have used more sage,\u201d Dayne mumbled as Simon kept babbling. \u201cIt\u2019s safe now,\u201d Dayne said when the fire had died.</p><p>Simon struggled within the magic that trapped him. \u201cWho are you talking to?\u201d</p><p>Anthony entered the circle, an unmistakable leer on his face as he looked hungrily at Greta. He wore his basic black, but his blond hair flowed loose around his face, which was caked in blood.</p> <p>\u201cLooks like I get a taste after all.\u201d</p><p>It looked like he\u2019d had plenty of tastes already.</p><p>Simon laughed. \u201cOh, this is a great plan. Vampires are entirely untrustworthy. He\u2019ll take too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut the hell up!\u201d Dayne said. He turned to Anthony. \u201cDo it.\u201d Dayne went to one side of the altar and threaded his fingers through Greta\u2019s. \u201cHe\u2019s not going to hurt you. I could have whipped up a potion to counteract the drugs, but there wasn\u2019t time. It\u2019s clumsy, but he can siphon the poison out of your bloodstream.\u201d Anthony knelt on the other side of Greta and gripped her chin, turning her head to the side. His breathing deepened, obviously aroused by the sight of her half-naked and bleeding. He licked a long trail up the side of her neck, and she shivered.</p><p>Dayne\u2019s grip tightened on her hand. \u201cJust get on with it.\u201d Anthony chuckled and sank his fangs into Greta\u2019s throat. She gritted her teeth, expecting pain, but what she felt instead was intense and unexpected pleasure. He took gentle tugs, and some delirious part of her thought maybe she should have taken him up on his offer before tonight.</p> <p>\u201cOkay, that\u2019s enough,\u201d she said as the strength in her voice returned. She struggled, but he growled and continued to drink.</p><p>The drugs didn\u2019t seem to affect his strength as they had hers.</p><p>Dayne grabbed him by the scruff of the neck and pulled him off her. Anthony was laughing, driven half-mad from the power of her blood. He gave a howl of pure pleasure that could have rivaled that of any therian and ran off into the woods to hunt.</p><p>She felt the change come over her as the moon warmed her skin.</p><p>The chains clanked against the stone altar, and her paws easily slipped out of them. She could feel her body mending itself, healing the damage she couldn\u2019t have taken for much longer in her human form.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want to do with him?\u201d Dayne gestured to Simon.</p> <p>Greta shifted back and quickly slipped the white gown over her head. The cuts on her body were already healed. She\u2019d been strong enough to shift and strong enough to heal, but Simon had success-fully drained some of her power into him. She felt revulsion at the kindred feeling flowing between them as they shared not only blood now, but power.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t let him live,\u201d Dayne said. His eyes were intense, imploring her to understand.</p><p>\u201cNo, we can\u2019t. Help me.\u201d She dug into Simon\u2019s pocket for the key and unlocked the chains bolted to the altar. The two of them worked quickly to restrain the tribe\u2019s fallen leader.</p><p>Greta bent to retrieve the ritual knife. Her human eyes locked with Jaden\u2019s cat eyes. Jaden looked from Simon to Greta, then back to Simon. Then she turned and ran off into the woods following the path Anthony had taken.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it,\u201d Dayne said, holding out his hand for the knife.</p><p>Greta\u2019s hand shook, and she gripped it more firmly. \u201cNo. It has to be me.\u201d</p><p>Simon couldn\u2019t continue living, and she wouldn\u2019t let him die a quick death with her power coiled inside him. It wasn\u2019t fair for him to take that to his grave. She bit her lip as she pressed the blade into Simon\u2019s flesh. She took no joy in the act. There was nothing to be gained from orphaning herself but closure.</p><p>Simon screamed, thrashed, and begged, much less stoic even than she\u2019d been. Greta forced herself to look away. She was tempted to snap his neck and end it, but she pressed on, unwilling to let him take any small victory to the afterlife.</p> <p>It was still raining when the life slipped from her father. Dayne draped his coat over her shoulders and took her back to the cottage.</p><p>She looked so lost. She\u2019d kept insisting he do the ritual. He should have told her no, but he knew she sought atonement for the blood she\u2019d spilt. Or perhaps she still thought he planned something villainous and wanted to complete her induction into evil.</p><p>He didn\u2019t have the heart to tell her he didn\u2019t need her blood anymore with Simon dead. He took it anyway, draining about a tablespoon\u2019s worth into a small clear vial. He opened a book, chanted, and felt the magic flare up and disperse.</p><p>He\u2019d performed a spell to help the flowers in the garden grow better. With her blood, it was going to be quite the botanical extravaganza. She\u2019d like it at least. He was deeply grateful for magical languages. It was the only thing preserving an ounce of his reputation.</p><p>The first thing Greta said after the magic faded was, \u201cWhat about Charlee? She tried to help me cross the border.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s fine. Anthony wiped her memory last night.\u201d They stood staring at each other, and then she flung herself at him, raining kisses over his neck, forcing her tongue into his mouth. Her hands wandered down his back and over his ass, and her eyes glittered with need.</p><p>\u201cDamn woman, how many days does this go on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouple of weeks sometimes. Was in a cage. No pills.\u201d</p><p>She reluctantly pushed herself away from him. Dayne could see the cogs turning furiously in her brain as she realized she didn\u2019t have to stay with him; he wasn\u2019t her only option. She turned to leave.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going anywhere.\u201d Dayne felt the possessiveness curl around him as he grabbed her hand and moved it back to his backside where she\u2019d been kneading his flesh and practically dry humping him moments before. \u201cLet\u2019s go upstairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really don\u2019t have to do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go upstairs,\u201d he repeated. He wasn\u2019t sure what could be going through Greta\u2019s mind to make her think sleeping with her was a chore. He knew how she felt about the cycle, and he was sorry she hadn\u2019t taken her pill in time. He should have thought of it before they\u2019d started the ritual.</p><p>Gift horse.</p><p>He scooped her up and carried her up the winding staircase.</p><p>\u201cYour room or mine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYours,\u201d she murmured against his neck.</p><p>Dayne took her upstairs and made love to her.</p><p>Greta woke to birds chirping outside the window and a distinct desire to shift and go chase after them. She felt sore from the previous night\u2019s fight and . . . other events.</p><p>Her pills were on the nightstand with a bottle of water. She swallowed one down.</p><p>Dayne\u2019s back was to her and he was curled in a ball like a large, old, and well-preserved squirrel. She wanted to curl her body around his and go back to sleep; let him wake her later. But she couldn\u2019t. She was sure she\u2019d been a nice diversion, but he\u2019d only agreed to let her stay until after the full moon, and she wasn\u2019t about to show her naivet\u00e9 by hoping for more. She was twenty-eight, not eighteen. It wasn\u2019t as if he\u2019d professed undying love.</p><p>Dayne\u2019s hand closed over her wrist. \u201cGood kitties don\u2019t run away,\u201d his sleep-filled voice rumbled.</p><p>Greta gave him a questioning look.</p><p>\u201cStay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you said just until after the moon?\u201d Practically every sexual encounter they\u2019d had had amounted to pity sex. She couldn\u2019t handle further pity or possible rejection.</p><p>She\u2019d become stupidly attached to him.</p><p>\u201cYou might need me to keep you safe,\u201d he hedged.</p><p>Greta bristled and jerked her arm away. \u201cI can take care of myself. I don\u2019t need your goodwill. Thanks anyway.\u201d Dayne chuckled and let his hand come to rest lightly on her thigh. \u201cYes, I saw that in action last night when you were tied down to an altar like the star of a B movie, complete with heaving bosom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was not heaving. And anyway, you just came to rescue me because you needed my blood. What was the spell for anyway?\u201d She hoped it wasn\u2019t for something world-ending.</p><p>\u201cOh, please. It was a huge hassle rescuing you. If I just needed blood, I could have taken one of the morbidly rubbernecking gawkers standing on the sidelines in the woods. Please stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need a man.\u201d</p><p>He scooted up behind her and trailed kisses over the back of her neck. \u201cDidn\u2019t say you did. But I\u2019m a very old man, and I now know the joys of having a pet around the house. Though in hindsight, seeing how well you listen, I should have gotten a dog.\u201d Greta smacked him on the arm. Dayne pulled her back and flipped them so he was straddling her. He planted a long, slow kiss on her lips. \u201cNow, stay. You took your pill, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I\u2019d like to make love again without you thinking I\u2019m doing it out of some twisted mercy. If you want me without the heat interfering, that is.\u201d</p><p>His hands started to stroke over her flesh and she relaxed and allowed her legs to fall open. A contented purr began to rumble through her chest. This was how Greta became kept.</p><p>Scroll to the next page for more info about upcoming releases. </p> </body></html>"]
