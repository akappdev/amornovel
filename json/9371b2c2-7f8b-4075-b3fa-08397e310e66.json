Pulling off a prank so epic that it\u2019d be talked about for decades was. I\u2019m standing with five of my friends in Headmaster Crowe\u2019s office listening to him rant for the past hour about how our latest prank embarrassed not only him but the trustees and teachers of this \u201cprestigious boarding school\u201d as well.</p><p>\u201cAnyone want to fess up?\u201d Crowe asks.</p> <p>Jack and Sam are freaking out. David, Jason, and Rich are trying to hold back their laughter. I\u2019ve been called into the headmaster\u2019s office more than a few times since I transferred here, so this is nothing new to me.</p><p>During finals week at Regents Preparatory Academy in California, seniors pull a prank on juniors. It\u2019s tradition. This year, the seniors managed to put blue dye in our showers and removed all the lightbulbs from the common areas of our dorm. It was only fair that we returned the favor, but on a bigger scale. The seniors had been waiting for us to raid their dorm, and you could tell they were on edge all week. They had lookouts posted at all hours, ready to defend their territory.</p><p>My roommate, Jack, came up with the brilliant idea of greasing three baby pigs from his uncle\u2019s farm and letting them run loose in the senior dorm. Sam said we should let the pigs run loose during graduation instead. I admit it was my idea to number the pigs . . . 1, 3, and 4. It took six of us to pull it off. The processional music was our cue to set the pigs loose.</p><p>I thought we\u2019d gotten away with it, too, until all of us got summoned into Crowe\u2019s office an hour ago.</p><p>Crowe\u2019s assistant, Martha, peeks her head into the office. \u201cMr. Crowe, number two still hasn\u2019t been found.\u201d</p> <p>The headmaster growls in frustration. If Crowe weren\u2019t such a dick, I\u2019d tell him to call off the search because there is no pig number 2\u2014that\u2019s part of the joke. But he\u2019s the kind of guy who doesn\u2019t give a shit about the students. All Crowe cares about is making sure everyone knows he\u2019s got the power to hand out detentions and fire teachers at his whim. I\u2019ve seen him abuse that power more than once during the past year.</p><p>\u201cI did it,\u201d I blurt out, exaggerating my Texas drawl because I know Crowe cringes at the thought of a redneck attending his precious school. More than a few times he\u2019s called me out for saying \u201creckon\u201d and \u201cy\u2019all.\u201d I reckon I did it just to annoy the guy.</p><p>Crowe stands in front of me. \u201cWhich of your buddies here helped you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of \u2019em, sir. I did it all on my own.\u201d</p><p>He shakes his finger at me. \u201cWhen your father hears about this he will most certainly be disappointed in you, Derek.\u201d</p><p>My spine stiffens. My dad, otherwise known as Commander Steven Fitzpatrick, is on another tour of duty. He\u2019s in a submarine for the next six months, completely cut off from the rest of the world.</p> <p>I briefly wonder how my new stepmother, Brandi, is doing now that my dad is deployed. Our setup is perfect. I live here until I graduate, and my dad\u2019s new wife lives in a rented house near the naval base with her five-year-old kid she had with some ex-boyfriend.</p><p>News of my pig stunt isn\u2019t likely to reach my dad. And if Crowe thinks I\u2019ll be disappointing Brandi, that\u2019s a laugh.</p><p>Crowe hunches his shoulders and gives me one of his many practiced scowls that make him resemble an ogre on steroids. \u201cYou expect me to believe that you stole one of our school vans and transported four pigs to the graduation ceremony, greased them up, and set them loose all by yourself?\u201d</p><p>I glance at my friends and signal for them to keep their mouths shut when I realize that more than a few of them are about to fess up. No reason all of us should get in trouble just because Crowe lacks a sense of humor.</p><p>I nod. \u201cI acted alone, sir. But technically I didn\u2019t steal the van. I borrowed it.\u201d There were three pigs and it took all six of us to pull it off, but I\u2019m keeping that info to myself. I wait for him to slap me with detention and order me to wash floors or bathrooms or something humiliating. Whatever. Detention during summer session will be a piece of cake since less than 20 percent of the school population stays on campus.</p><p>\u201cThe rest of you gentlemen are dismissed,\u201d Crowe declares. He takes a seat in his big leather chair and picks up his phone as my friends file out. \u201cMartha, call Mrs. Fitzpatrick and inform her that her stepson has been expelled.\u201d</p><p>Wait! What?</p><p>\u201cExpelled?\u201d I practically choke on the word. What about a warning or detention or suspension? \u201cIt was a harmless prank.\u201d</p> <p>He carefully hangs up the phone. \u201cExpelled. Actions have consequences, Mr. Fitzpatrick. Despite numerous warnings about your cheating, drug use, and pranks, you have again disobeyed our rules and proven yourself unworthy to be a student at Regents Preparatory Academy. Obviously this also means you will not be invited to rejoin us for your senior year.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t move or say anything. This is not happening. I can count a dozen other students who\u2019ve gotten caught pulling pranks and have escaped without so much as a warning. I accidentally left my notes on the floor during a test and Mr. Rappaport wrote me up for cheating. And the drug accusation . . . okay, so I went to a party with a few friends and came home wasted. I didn\u2019t mean to puke on the statue of Regents\u2019 founder after I found out someone slipped XTC into my drink, and I sure as hell wasn\u2019t the one to post pics of me puking on the school website. A certain senior on student council was responsible for that one, although he never got caught because nobody would accuse a guy whose dad donates a crapload of money to the school every year.</p><p>\u201cSince you\u2019ve already finished your finals, I\u2019ll be lenient and allow you to receive full credit for your junior year. As a courtesy to your father, I\u2019ll also grant you forty-eight hours to remove your belongings from campus.\u201d He starts writing on a piece of paper, then glances up at me when he realizes I\u2019m not moving. \u201cThat will be all, Mr. Fitzpatrick.\u201d</p><p>Lenient?</p><p>I walk to the junior dorm as the absurdity of my situation sets in. I\u2019m being kicked out of Regents and have to move back home. With my stepmother, who lives in her own, clueless world. This is bullshit.</p><p>My roommate, Jack, is sitting on the edge of his bed, shaking his head. \u201cI heard Crowe say you got expelled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe if we all go back there and tell him the truth, he\u2019ll rethink\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf your dad finds out, he\u2019ll make your life a livin\u2019 hell. The other guys\u2019ll be in the same boat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t take the fall for this alone, Derek.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t sweat it,\u201d I say. \u201cCrowe had it in for me. This just gave him the excuse he needed to kick me out.\u201d</p><p>A half hour later Brandi calls. My stepmother\u2019s heard the news from Crowe and will drive the three hours from San Diego to Regents tomorrow. She doesn\u2019t yell or lecture me or act like she\u2019s my mom. Instead, she says she\u2019d try to convince Crowe to change his mind about expelling me. As if that\u2019s gonna work. I doubt Brandi was a member of her high school debate team. I don\u2019t have much faith in her persuasion skills. To be honest, I\u2019m not even sure she graduated from high school.</p><p>In the morning I\u2019m still figuring out what the hell I\u2019m gonna do when campus security knocks on my door. They have specific orders to escort me to the headmaster\u2019s office immediately.</p><p>As I walk across the quad with campus security flanking me, I\u2019m all too aware of whispers from students I pass. It\u2019s not often someone gets expelled. I walk up the stairs to the front office, where photos of former students who became famous athletes, astronauts, congressmen, and business gurus are proudly displayed on the Wall of Fame. If it were two years ago, I might have imagined my own picture on the wall, but not anymore.</p><p>When the door opens to Crowe\u2019s office, my eyes focus on the woman sitting in front of his desk. It\u2019s Brandi, my dad\u2019s wife of eight months. She\u2019s fourteen years younger than my dad (which means she\u2019s twenty-five, only eight years older than me). Her orange stilettos match her oversize orange earrings dangling down to her shoulders. Her dress looks two sizes too big, which is definitely out of character. Every time I\u2019ve seen her she\u2019s worn tight-fitting, low-cut outfits like she\u2019s about to go clubbing. She looks out of place in this office full of mahogany and dark leather.</p><p>Brandi glances at me when I walk in, then returns all her attention to Crowe. \u201cSo what are our options?\u201d she asks as she fiddles with her earring.</p><p>Crowe closes the folder on his desk. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I see no options. Heinous crimes involving animals are not tolerated at Regents, Mrs. Fitzpatrick. Your son\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStepson,\u201d I correct him.</p><p>Crowe regards me with disgust. \u201cYour stepson has finally crossed the line. First, I\u2019m told he\u2019s quit all extracurricular activities. Next, he\u2019s been rumored to attend parties with alcohol and drugs. That\u2019s in addition to the cheating on tests and defacing school property with vomit. Now this prank with live farm animals. We\u2019ve been patient with Derek and sympathize with the challenges he\u2019s faced in recent years, but that does not excuse delinquent behavior. We have a duty at Regents Preparatory Academy to mold our young students into productive citizens and future leaders who are responsible for their community and environment. Derek obviously no longer wishes to be part of that proud tradition.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you just assign him community service or have him, like, write some kind of apology letter thingie?\u201d Brandi asks, her bracelets clinking as she taps her brightly polished fingernails against her purse.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid not, Mrs. Fitzpatrick. Derek has given me no choice but to expel him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy expelling him you mean, like, he can\u2019t come back for his senior year?\u201d A speck of sunlight shines on her wedding band, a stark reminder that she\u2019s married to my dad.</p><p>\u201cThat would be correct. My hands are tied,\u201d Crowe tells her, which is a complete lie. He makes the rules and changes them on a moment\u2019s notice to suit his needs. I\u2019m not about to call him out. It won\u2019t change anything, so why bother? \u201cThe decision has been made,\u201d Crowe continues. \u201cIf you\u2019d like to appeal to the board, most of whom witnessed the debacle yesterday at the graduation ceremony, you\u2019re free to fill out the appropriate paperwork. Although I warn you the appeals process is lengthy and a positive outcome is unlikely. Now if you\u2019ll excuse me, we still haven\u2019t located one of the animals that your stepson let loose and I have to do some very extensive damage control.\u201d</p><p>Brandi opens her lips in a last-ditch effort to persuade him, but closes them with a sigh when, with a flick of his wrist, Crowe motions for us to leave his office.</p><p>Brandi follows me back to my dorm, her stilettos clicking on the sidewalk. Click, click, click, click. I didn\u2019t notice back in the office, but she\u2019s definitely gained weight since I last saw her. Doesn\u2019t she care that everyone is staring at her and her ridiculous outfit and big blond hair with overly long extensions? Knowing her, she probably doesn\u2019t even realize the scene she\u2019s causing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My dad sat me down before he announced they were getting married and said Brandi made him happy. That\u2019s the only reason I haven\u2019t completely written her off.</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Brandi says, her cheery tone carrying across the quad, \u201cthis is for the best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe best?\u201d I give a short laugh as I stop and turn to her. \u201cWhat\u2019s the best about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve decided to move back to Chicago to live with my family,\u201d she says. \u201cSince your dad\u2019s gone for six months, I figure it\u2019s the best thing for Julian. He\u2019ll be starting kindergarten in the fall, you know.\u201d Brandi gives me a big smile.</p> <p>I think she expects me to jump up and down clapping in excitement at her big relocation news. Or smile right along with her. None of those things are about to happen.</p><p>\u201cBrandi, I\u2019m not movin\u2019 to Chicago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be silly. You\u2019ll love it in Chicago, Derek. They\u2019ve got snow in the winter, and in the fall the leaves are, like, the coolest colors\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d I say, interrupting her Chicago-is-all-that speech. \u201cNo offense, but we\u2019re hardly family. Y\u2019all can move to Chicago. I\u2019ll stay in San Diego.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah . . . about that . . .\u201d She bites her bottom lip. \u201cI canceled the lease. Another family is moving into the house next week. I was gonna tell you, but I knew you had finals coming up, and since you\u2019d already planned to stay on campus all summer I, like, didn\u2019t think it was urgent.\u201d</p> <p>A feeling of dread settles in my stomach. \u201cYou\u2019re sayin\u2019 I, like, don\u2019t have anywhere to live?\u201d</p><p>She smiles once again. \u201cSure you do. In Chicago, with me and Julian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrandi, come on. You don\u2019t honestly think I want to move to Chicago for my senior year.\u201d People move from Chicago to California, not the other way around.</p><p>\u201cI promise you\u2019ll love Chicago,\u201d she gushes.</p><p>No, I won\u2019t. Unfortunately, there\u2019s no one I can stay with in California. My dad\u2019s parents are dead and I heard my mom\u2019s dad died a while back. My mom\u2019s mom . . . well, let\u2019s just say she lives in Texas and leave it at that. No chance in hell I\u2019m living with her. \u201cI don\u2019t have a choice, do I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d Brandi shrugs. \u201cYour dad left me responsible for you. If you can\u2019t live at the academy, you\u2019ll have to stay with me . . . in Chicago.\u201d</p> <p>If she mentions the word \u201cChicago\u201d one more time I think my head might explode. This is not happening. I hope I\u2019m living in some kind of realistic nightmare and I\u2019ll wake up any minute.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s one more thing I haven\u2019t told you,\u201d Brandi says as if she\u2019s talking to a toddler.</p><p>I rub the back of my neck, where a knot is starting to form. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>She puts her hand over her stomach and says in a high-pitched, excited voice, \u201cI\u2019m pregnant.\u201d</p><p>No. Fucking. Way.</p><p>She can\u2019t be.</p><p>I mean, it\u2019s physically possible, but . . . the knot on the back of my neck is throbbing in earnest now, threatening to burst out of my skin. This is definitely a nightmare.</p><p>I want her to tell me she\u2019s kidding, but she doesn\u2019t. It was bad enough my dad married the bimbo. I expected him to realize eventually that marrying her was a mistake, but now . . . a baby permanently seals the deal.</p> <p>I\u2019m gonna be sick.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to keep it a secret until you came home for the Fourth of July,\u201d she explains excitedly. \u201cSurprise! Your father and I are expecting a baby, Derek. I think your being expelled is a sign that we\u2019re all supposed to be together in Chicago. As a family.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s wrong. My being expelled is a sign, all right, but not that we\u2019re supposed to be together in Chicago . . . it\u2019s a sign that my life is about to implode.</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>Ashtyn</p><p>I\u2019ve been the only girl on the football team at Fremont High since freshman year, so it\u2019s not a big deal when Coach Dieter shouts a warning to the guys to make sure they\u2019re decent as I head into the boys\u2019 locker room for the first football meeting of the summer. My coach pats me on the back as I pass, just like he does to the guys.</p><p>\u201cYou ready for senior year, Parker?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the first day of summer break, Coach,\u201d I answer. \u201cLet me enjoy it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t enjoy it too much. Work hard this summer during practice and at that football camp in Texas, because I expect a winning season come the fall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll take State for the first time in forty years, Coach!\u201d one of my teammates yells out. His words are met by enthusiastic cheers from the rest of the team, including me. We almost made it to State last season, but we lost in the playoffs.</p><p>\u201cAll right, all right. Don\u2019t get ahead of yourselves,\u201d Dieter says. \u201cLet\u2019s get down to business first. It\u2019s that time of year to vote for who you consider the player most deserving of leading this team. Think of the player whose talent, hard work, and dedication to this team is undeniable. The player who receives the most votes will be chosen as captain for the coming season.\u201d</p><p>Being voted captain is a huge deal at my school. There are a bunch of clubs and sports teams, but only one counts\u2014football. I glance proudly at my boyfriend, Landon McKnight. He\u2019ll be voted captain. He\u2019s the first-string quarterback and expected to lead us to the Illinois state championship. His dad was in the NFL, and Landon is all set to follow in his footsteps. More than a few times last season Landon\u2019s dad even brought college scouts to watch his son. With his talent and connections, there\u2019s no question he\u2019s going to get a scholarship to play in college.</p><p>We started dating at the beginning of last season, right after Coach Dieter moved me up to first-string kicker. I perfected my technique the summer before my junior year and it paid off. The guys on the team would watch me practice, making bets on how many field goals I could make in a row.</p><p>I used to be self-conscious about being the only girl on the team. Freshman year I stayed in the background, hoping to blend in. The guys made comments to intimidate me, but I laughed them off and threw comments right back. I never wanted special consideration and fought to be treated like another teammate who just happened to be a girl.</p><p>Dieter, wearing his trademark khaki pants and polo shirt with FREMONT REBELS embroidered on it, hands me my ballot. Landon gives me a nod. Everyone knows we\u2019re dating, but we keep our relationship on the down low at practice.</p><p>I write Landon\u2019s name on the ballot, then hand it in.</p><p>Dieter goes over our brutal practice schedule while the assistant coaches count the ballots.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t win games by sitting on your asses,\u201d Dieter says during his lecture. \u201cAnd besides, we\u2019re expecting to attract more college scouts this year. I know more than a few of you would like to play college ball. Seniors, this is your year to prove yourselves.\u201d Dieter doesn\u2019t say the obvious, that the scouts are coming to see Landon but we\u2019ll all benefit from their presence.</p><p>It would be amazing to play college ball, but I\u2019m not delusional enough to think scouts will be knocking down my door. Only a handful of girls have been chosen to play for collegiate teams, and almost all of them are walk-ons without scholarships. Except Katie Calhoun. She was the first female to get a Division I football scholarship. I\u2019d do anything to be like Katie.</p><p>I\u2019ve watched football with my dad for as long as I can remember. Even after my mom left and he checked out of being a parent, we still watched the Bears together. He was a kicker for Fremont High forty years ago, the first and last time our high school won the state championship. The lone championship banner hangs on the gymnasium wall.</p><p>I guess going out for football freshman year was a way for me to try to connect with my dad . . . Maybe if he saw me kick enough goals he\u2019d be impressed. Freshman year, I hoped my dad would come to games and cheer me on. He never did\u2014he still hasn\u2019t, and I\u2019ll be a senior in the fall. My mom hasn\u2019t seen me play, either. I think she\u2019s living in some high-rise apartment in New York, but I haven\u2019t heard from her in almost a year. One day I\u2019ll prove to my parents that they\u2019re missing out, because it sucks feeling like your family doesn\u2019t care if you exist.</p><p>Luckily I have Landon.</p><p>As Dieter winds up his big pep talk and lecture, one of the assistant coaches hands him the voting results. He reads the paper silently, nods his approval, then writes on the whiteboard:</p><p>CAPTAIN</p><p>ASHTYN PARKER</p><p>Wait . . . what?</p><p>No way. I read that wrong.</p><p>I blink a few times as I feel pats on my back from my teammates. My name is clearly written, no mistake about that.</p><p>Jet Thacker, our star wide receiver, gives a hoot. \u201cWay to go, Parker!\u201d</p><p>The other guys start chanting my last name . . . \u201cParker! Parker! Parker!\u201d</p><p>I glance at Landon. He\u2019s staring at the whiteboard. I want him to look at me, congratulate me, or make me feel like this is okay. It\u2019s not. I know he\u2019s floored. I am, too. I feel like the earth just tilted on its axis.</p><p>Dieter blows his whistle. \u201cParker, meet me in my office. The rest of you are dismissed,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cCongrats, Ash,\u201d Landon mumbles, barely pausing as he walks past me on his way out. I want to pull him back so I can tell him I had no clue how this happened, but he\u2019s gone before I have a chance.</p><p>I follow Dieter to his office. \u201cCongratulations, Parker,\u201d he says as he tosses me a patch with the letter C on it so I can sew it onto my letterman jacket. Another one will be sewn onto my game jersey. \u201cStarting in August you\u2019ll have weekly meetings with me and the coaching staff. You\u2019ll have to keep your GPA at or above a 3.0 and continue to lead this team on and off the field.\u201d He talks to me more about my responsibilities and ends with: \u201cThe team is counting on you, and so am I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCoach,\u201d I say as I run my fingers over the smooth embroidery on the patch. I place it on his desk and step back. \u201cLandon deserves to be captain, not me. I\u2019ll step down and let him take my\u2014\u201d</p><p>Dieter holds up a hand. \u201cStop right there, Parker. You were voted captain, not McKnight. You got more votes than any other player. I don\u2019t respect players who quit when they\u2019re asked to step up by their peers. Are you a quitter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sir.\u201d</p><p>He tosses the patch back to me. \u201cThen get out of here.\u201d</p><p>I nod, then walk out of his office. Back in the locker room, I lean against a locker and look down at the patch with the big C on it. Captain. I take a deep breath as reality sinks in. I was voted captain of the football team. Me, Ashtyn Parker. I\u2019m honored and thankful my teammates voted for me, but I\u2019m still in shock.</p><p>Outside, I hope to see Landon waiting by my car. Instead Victor Salazar and Jet Thacker are talking in front of my old beat-up Dodge that needs a new paint job . . . and a new engine, for that matter.</p><p>Victor, our middle linebacker with more sacks than any other player in the state of Illinois, doesn\u2019t talk much. His dad practically owns this town, and Vic is expected to do whatever his father orders. Behind his father\u2019s back, Vic is reckless and a daredevil. It\u2019s as if he doesn\u2019t care whether he lives or dies, which is why he\u2019s so dangerous on the field. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jet drapes an arm over my shoulder. \u201cYou know Fairfield is gonna have a field day when they find out their rival is about to have a girl captain. Those motherfuckers egged Chad Young\u2019s house the day he got voted captain last year, so we retaliated and tp\u2019d their captain\u2019s house. Watch your back, Parker. Once word gets out, you\u2019re a target.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got your back,\u201d Vic says in a gruff voice. He means it.</p><p>\u201cWe all do,\u201d Jet says. \u201cJust remember that.\u201d</p><p>Target? I convince myself that I can handle being a target. I\u2019m strong, tough, and nobody is going to get the best of me.</p> <p>I\u2019m not a quitter.</p><p>I\u2019m the captain of the Fremont High football team!</p><p>Chapter 3</p><p>Derek</p><p>My muscles are tense when we pull into the driveway at my stepmother\u2019s childhood home in a small suburb of Chicago. I drove my dad\u2019s SUV and followed Brandi in her new white Toyota with blinged-out rims. We drove for six days. As soon as we step out of the cars, an older man I assume is Brandi\u2019s father appears on the front porch of the two-story redbrick house. He\u2019s got brown hair just starting to gray at the temples, and he sure isn\u2019t smiling. The dude is staring at Brandi as if she\u2019s a stranger. It\u2019s a standoff, with neither willing to make the first move.</p> <p>I don\u2019t know what went down with Brandi and her old man. She didn\u2019t explain much, except to say she left home right after her parents\u2019 divorce and hadn\u2019t been back . . . until now.</p><p>Brandi grasps Julian by the hand and tugs the tired kid up the porch stairs. \u201cThis is my son. Julian, say hello to Grandpa.\u201d</p><p>Brandi\u2019s son is a cool kid who can talk your ear off. But he\u2019s acting shy right now and doesn\u2019t say hello to his grandfather. Instead, he keeps his eyes focused on his sneakers. Brandi\u2019s old man does the same.</p><p>\u201cAnd this is my stepson, Derek,\u201d Brandi finally says as she waves her hand in my direction.</p><p>Her father looks up. \u201cYou didn\u2019t say anything about a stepson when you called.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not surprised Brandi didn\u2019t prep her father about me. Common sense is not her strong suit.</p> <p>Brandi cocks her head to the side, her big red hoop earrings reminding me of those ring-toss things at the carnival. I think she\u2019s got a set to match every color in her wardrobe. \u201cDidn\u2019t I? I\u2019m such a flake I must\u2019ve forgotten to tell you, with all the moving and packing and . . . other stuff. Derek can stay in the den.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe den is filled with boxes,\u201d he tells her. \u201cAnd I gave the old couch that was in the den to charity a while back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019d rather, sir,\u201d I drawl, \u201cI can sleep on the porch. Just give me a blanket and toss me scraps of food every now an\u2019 then and I\u2019ll be just fine.\u201d It\u2019s times like these that I\u2019m wound so tight I can\u2019t turn off the natural twang in my voice even if I want to.</p><p>Brandi\u2019s dad narrows his eyes at me. I have the feeling if I let three greased pigs loose in his yard he\u2019d shoot \u2019em, eat \u2019em, and then attempt to skin me alive.</p><p>\u201cNonsense,\u201d Brandi says. \u201cDerek can stay in my old room with Julian, and I\u2019ll sleep on the couch in the living room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll move the boxes and put a blow-up bed in the den,\u201d her dad says, reluctantly giving in when he realizes that I\u2019m not about to hightail it back to California.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m cool with that,\u201d I say.</p><p>It\u2019s not like I plan on hanging around the house all that often.</p> <p>\u201cDerek, can you and my dad bring our stuff in the house while I put Julian down for a nap?\u201d Brandi asks. \u201cI\u2019m exhausted from the trip and need a nap myself.\u201d I note she doesn\u2019t spill the beans to her dad that she\u2019s pregnant, not that she can keep the secret for long.</p><p>Before I can answer, she slips through the front door with Julian, leaving me alone with her grouchy old man.</p><p>Her father scans me up and down. He doesn\u2019t look impressed.</p><p>\u201cHow old are you?\u201d His gravelly voice carries down the steps and across the yard to where I\u2019m standing near the packed SUV.</p><p>\u201cSeventeen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t expect you to call me Grandpa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t plannin\u2019 on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I suppose you can call me Gus.\u201d He sighs in frustration. I\u2019m about as thrilled to be here as he appears to have me here. \u201cYou gonna come in, or are you about to stand there all day and wait for an invitation?\u201d</p><p>He disappears inside. I\u2019m tempted not to follow, but I have no choice. The house is old, with dark wood floors and well-lived-in furniture. The floorboards creak as I walk, reminding me of a haunted house.</p><p>He leads me down a hall to a back room and swings open a door. \u201cThis\u2019ll be your room. I expect you to keep it clean, do your own laundry, and make yourself useful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I get an allowance?\u201d I joke.</p><p>The guy looks at me with a deadpan expression. \u201cYou\u2019re a real comedian, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo people with a sense of humor, yeah.\u201d</p><p>He makes a harrumph sound in response.</p><p>I follow again when he makes an about-face and heads back to the car. I don\u2019t expect him to help unload the boxes, but he does. It doesn\u2019t take us long to lug everything into the house. We put Brandi\u2019s and Julian\u2019s stuff in her room upstairs and mine in the den. There\u2019s no conversation. This is definitely going to be an interesting living situation\u2014not in a good way.</p><p>I\u2019m moving boxes to the corner of my room to clear space when Gus reappears. Without a word, he hands me an air mattress and leaves me to figure out how to inflate it. I have no clue why Brandi would want to come back and live with a father who obviously doesn\u2019t want her here.</p><p>My dad is the opposite of Brandi\u2019s. When I was younger and my dad came home on leave, he was all smiles the second he saw us. He\u2019d hug me and my mom so tight we\u2019d pretend we couldn\u2019t breathe.</p><p>Brandi\u2019s dad didn\u2019t even hug her, when I know they haven\u2019t seen each other for years. Hell, they didn\u2019t even bother to shake hands or pat each other on the back. And he hardly acknowledged his own grandson.</p><p>I shove my suitcase behind the door and take in my new room. Faded wood paneling is on the walls. Boxes are scattered everywhere. There\u2019s an old fireplace in the corner that looks like it hasn\u2019t been used since the Civil War. At least there are two windows to keep the place filled with light. This place doesn\u2019t feel like home\u2014not by a long shot. It doesn\u2019t remind me of Regents, either, surrounded by friends. I remind myself I\u2019m here because I have to be.</p><p>Suddenly this house feels like it\u2019s suffocating me.</p><p>I head to the backyard. It\u2019s hot and the sun is shining, so I strip off my shirt and tuck it into the waistband of my jeans. The grass is so tall I wonder if it\u2019s ever been mowed. I walk through a small garden of weeds to a big wooden shed. The paint is chipping, obviously having been neglected for years. An old padlock on the latch is open, so I push back the door. Rusty garden tools hang on wall hooks, spray-paint cans and bags of weed killer are scattered on the workbench, and little metal buckets crowd the floor. I kick a bucket aside, then pick up a second one, thinking about everything that\u2019s changed in the past two years.</p><p>I swear under my breath and whip the bucket across the shed, the sound of the metal hitting the wall echoing in the small space.</p><p>\u201cStop or I\u2019m calling the police!\u201d demands a girl\u2019s voice from behind me.</p><p>I turn to find a hot chick about my age with blond hair in one long braid snaking down her chest. She\u2019s blocking the doorway and holding a rusty pitchfork. She looks like she\u2019s ready to stab me to death, which lessens her hotness factor, but not by much.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019re you?\u201d I ask, taking in her black T-shirt and matching hoodie. If she weren\u2019t threatening to stab me, I could imagine her being one of those sexy warrior girls in a video game or action flick. And while it\u2019d be damn cool to fight her in a video game, in real life that\u2019s never gonna happen.</p><p>Next to her is a monstrosity of a dog with short gray hair and gunmetal eyes that match hers. The beast barks at me as if I\u2019m fresh meat and he hasn\u2019t eaten in months. Streams of drool fly from his mouth with each bark.</p><p>\u201cQuiet, Falkor!\u201d the warrior girl orders. The beast goes silent, but his lip twitches in a menacing snarl as he stands next to her like a soldier, prepared to pounce at her command. \u201cYou thugs from Fairfield think you can come here and\u2014\u201d</p><p>I hold up a hand, halting her tirade for the moment. Me, a thug? That\u2019s hilarious. This girl\u2019s thug radar is way off. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been called a thug before. \u201cI hate to break the news to you, sweetheart, but I\u2019ve got no clue where Fairfield is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, right. I\u2019m not stupid. And I\u2019m not your sweetheart. I don\u2019t even fall for that really bad fake southern accent.\u201d Rustling in the garden captures her dog\u2019s attention. He abandons his post and leaps toward some unlucky critter. \u201cFalkor, come back here!\u201d she orders, but the beast ignores her.</p><p>\u201cPut the pitchfork down, honey.\u201d I take a step closer to her and the exit.</p><p>\u201cNot on your life. I\u2019m warning you . . . take one step closer and I\u2019ll stab you.\u201d One glance at her shaking hands tells me she doesn\u2019t have the nerve to go through with her threat.</p><p>I put my hands up in mock surrender.</p><p>I wish this girl had an on/off switch so I could permanently shut her down. I\u2019m standing directly in front of her now, the points of the pitchfork an inch away from my chest. \u201cYou really don\u2019t want to stab me,\u201d I tell her.</p><p>\u201cYes, I think I do.\u201d The warrior girl blinks her fierce eyes. For a second I\u2019m sure she\u2019s about to lower her weapon, until I hear something creak behind me. As I glance over my shoulder, a bracket holding a bunch of tools on the wall crashes to the ground. The sound startles the girl and she drops the pitchfork. On my foot.</p><p>What the\u2014</p><p>She stares at the pointed tine sticking out of my left shoe and her mouth opens in shock. Before I know it, she backs up and slams the door shut. I\u2019m swallowed by darkness as I hear the padlock snap into place. Two thoughts cross my mind: she thinks I\u2019m a thug and I think she\u2019s a wackjob.</p><p>One of us is right, and it\u2019s not her.</p><p>Chapter 4</p><p>Ashtyn</p><p>I can\u2019t believe I just stabbed someone! A thug from Fairfield I\u2019ve never seen before. He\u2019s too cute for his own good, and he\u2019s tall, with shaggy brown hair peeking out from a knit cap. If that isn\u2019t bad enough, he isn\u2019t wearing a shirt and is totally ripped. If I didn\u2019t know any better, I\u2019d think he was posing for a magazine spread. Did he actually think he\u2019d get away with vandalizing our property with those old spray-paint cans he was hovering over? Those jerks from Fairfield are always causing trouble on our side of town. Jet\u2019s warning is still fresh in my mind. I was voted captain and became a target as soon as word got out.</p><p>I run as fast as I can toward my house, refusing to panic but not doing a great job. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDad!\u201d I yell as I rush inside, hoping he\u2019s home and not at work. \u201cThere\u2019s a guy in the . . .\u201d</p><p>My voice trails off as I catch a glimpse of a strange woman in our kitchen standing in front of the open refrigerator. She\u2019s wearing a red sundress and big red earrings to match. I think she\u2019s about to steal our food, but when she smiles brightly and says, \u201cHi! Wow, my baby sister\u2019s all grown up!\u201d my mind focuses and I\u2019m stunned.</p><p>The woman standing ten feet away from me isn\u2019t a food burglar. She\u2019s my sister, Brandi. In the flesh. I recognize her now . . . an older and bigger version of the eighteen-year-old who left when I was in fifth grade.</p><p>\u201cUmm . . . hi,\u201d I say, dumbfounded.</p> <p>My dad said Brandi was coming to stay with us for a little while. I didn\u2019t believe it, because my sister hasn\u2019t called or written or e-mailed or texted me since she left when I was ten. Not even to tell me she\u2019d had a son with her ex-boyfriend Nick, or that she\u2019d recently married some random Navy guy. I found that out when I ran into an old friend of hers.</p><p>I haven\u2019t seen my sister in seven years. With her bright and cheery \u201chi,\u201d she\u2019s acting like it was yesterday.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Dad?\u201d I ask, postponing our reunion because there\u2019s an intruder in the shed with a pitchfork sticking out of his foot.</p><p>\u201cI think he went to work or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no. That\u2019s not good.\u201d I bite my bottom lip as I worry about the boy in the shed. Will I be arrested? Coach Dieter won\u2019t be happy to find out that within an hour of being voted captain I stabbed someone. Forget maintaining a 3.0 or higher GPA. Stabbing people in the foot isn\u2019t exactly role-model material, but I have a good excuse. I was defending my house . . . or, more precisely, my shed. What am I supposed to do? Should I call the police or ambulance . . . or both?</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Brandi asks.</p><p>\u201cUmm . . . there\u2019s a little situation out back.\u201d I cringe at the thought of what I just did.</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI locked a football player from Fairfield High in our shed. They\u2019re animals,\u201d I explain quickly as I gesture toward the backyard. \u201cI told him to leave, but he wouldn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t mean to stab him.\u201d</p><p>My sister\u2019s eyes go wide. \u201cStab him? Oh, my gosh. Umm. Umm. Umm. What should we do? Umm . . . I got it!\u201d she says frantically. \u201cDerek will help!\u201d My sister slams the refrigerator door and hurries toward the den, yelling, \u201cDerek!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Derek?\u201d</p> <p>Finding nobody in the den, she runs to the living room, her long bleached blond hair flying behind her. \u201cDerek, you in here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Derek?\u201d I ask again. I thought her husband\u2019s name was Steve. Supposedly he\u2019s deployed and wasn\u2019t due back for a while. Did Brandi dump him and already move on to a new guy? I wouldn\u2019t put it past her. My sister was never known as the stable type.</p><p>\u201cDerek\u2019s my stepson, Ashtyn.\u201d I follow as she heads upstairs calling, \u201cDerek, we need your help! Where are you?\u201d</p><p>Stepson? What is she talking about? She\u2019s got a son named Julian, but I hadn\u2019t heard about another kid. \u201cYou have a stepson?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. He\u2019s Steve\u2019s son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is Steve\u2019s little kid gonna help us, Brandi?\u201d</p><p>Brandi whips around to face me with furrowed brows. \u201cDerek\u2019s not a little kid, Ashtyn. He\u2019s seventeen.\u201d</p><p>Seventeen? My age?</p> <p>I get a sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach. No, he couldn\u2019t be. But what if he is?</p><p>\u201cIs he tall . . . with blue eyes, a southern accent, and a knit cap?\u201d I ask, my heart beating so fast I wonder if it\u2019s going to burst out of my chest.</p><p>My sister\u2019s eyes go wider. We both realize my horrific mistake and race to the shed. I get there first. Falkor barks like crazy, his long tail wagging back and forth excitedly.</p><p>Brandi pounds on the door. \u201cDerek, it\u2019s me, Brandi. Please tell me you\u2019re, like, not bleeding to death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d comes the guy\u2019s muffled voice from inside the shed.</p><p>Brandi yanks on the padlock. \u201cAshtyn, we need the key.\u201d</p><p>Umm . . . \u201cKey?\u201d</p><p>More wide-eyed stares. \u201cYeah, key. You know, those oddly shaped metal things you use to unlock stuff. Where is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kiddin\u2019 me,\u201d Derek moans.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Derek. We\u2019ll get you out in a jiffy,\u201d Brandi cries out. \u201cAshtyn, where does Dad keep those big sharp cutters?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the shed,\u201d I answer weakly.</p><p>Brandi picks up a rock and starts slamming it against the padlock, as if that will somehow magically unlock the thing.</p><p>\u201cI can break the door down if you want me to,\u201d Derek yells through the door, \u201cbut I can\u2019t guarantee the roof won\u2019t collapse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I yell. I don\u2019t want to be responsible for Brandi\u2019s stepson being stabbed in the foot and the shed collapsing on him. He could get crushed. There are too many sharp tools inside, ones that could cut off really important body parts. I rack my brain, trying to think of where the key might be. That door hasn\u2019t been locked in years.</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d I call out. Brandi stops her rock assault. \u201cLet me think a minute.\u201d</p><p>I ignore the frustrated snort from inside the shed.</p><p>I get an idea. \u201cDerek, see if you can find a watering can in the shed. My dad used to hide a spare key in there. If you find it, you can push it through one of the slats. I know it\u2019s dark, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll use my cell phone light.\u201d I hear Derek rummaging through the shed. \u201cFound it.\u201d</p><p>I never thought those words would make me so happy.</p><p>Derek pushes the key through a gap in the slats. Brandi unlocks the padlock and opens the door as I peek around her at her stepson. Derek and his abs are leaning against the workbench. He looks relaxed and maybe a little irritated, but he\u2019s definitely not bleeding to death.</p><p>\u201cDerek, this is my sister, Ashtyn,\u201d Brandi says as she rushes up to the guy. \u201cYour, um, step-aunt. Isn\u2019t it funny that you guys are the same age?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHilarious.\u201d He shakes his head like he can\u2019t believe he\u2019s in this situation. He\u2019s not the only one.</p><p>Brandi glances down at the pitchfork lying next to him, then stares at his feet. There\u2019s a hole in his left shoe.</p><p>\u201cO\u2019migod,\u201d she says, eyeing the hole. \u201cYou really did stab him!\u201d She kneels down like a concerned mother hen and examines his shoe.</p><p>\u201cNot on purpose,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cAt least she\u2019s got bad aim,\u201d Derek says in a sexy drawl. \u201cIt just grazed my toe.\u201d</p><p>Brandi gnaws on her lip. \u201cWhat about lockjaw? Julian\u2019s pediatrician said you could die if you\u2019re cut from something rusty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, little guy,\u201d Derek says to someone behind me. \u201cI had a tetanus booster last year.\u201d</p><p>Little guy? I turn around to see who he\u2019s talking to. An adorable little boy with blond hair has joined us, obviously my nephew, Julian. He stares at the hole in Derek\u2019s shoe, then looks up at me with fear, as if I\u2019m the Grim Reaper here to collect humans on earth and bring them back to Hell with me.</p><p>Brandi pats her son\u2019s head. \u201cAshtyn, this is Julian. Julian, meet your auntie Ashtyn.\u201d</p><p>Julian won\u2019t even look in my direction. Instead, he looks up at Derek as if he\u2019s his hero for life.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid of her,\u201d Derek tells Julian. \u201cYour aunt\u2019s not mean. She\u2019s just crazy.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 5</p><p>Derek</p><p>I manage to stay away from Ashtyn the rest of the day, hoping to avoid the crazy warrior girl who locked me in the shed. Apparently she doesn\u2019t feel the need to avoid me, though, because as I\u2019m talking to my old roommate, Jack, on my cell and giving him props for managing to stuff my suitcase with random poker chips as a good-bye prank, she stomps into the den without knocking or an invitation. Her guardian watchdog tags along.</p><p>\u201cI have a bone to pick with you.\u201d She crosses her arms on her chest. Her dog flops down on the floor next to her. I bet if he could cross his front legs on his chest to imitate her, he would.</p><p>I raise an eyebrow, amused. \u201cJack, I\u2019ll call you back.\u201d I slide my cell into my pocket, lean against the wall, and prop my feet up on the box labeled WINTER CLOTHES I\u2019m using as a mock coffee table. \u201cWhat bone do you want to pick?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrow. The girl doesn\u2019t miss the double meaning as I throw her words back at her.</p><p>She ignores my joke and instead lets out a burst of irritation. \u201cFirst off, you need to tell my nephew I\u2019m not crazy. The kid won\u2019t even look at me.\u201d</p><p>I wag my foot. \u201cI\u2019m not the one threatenin\u2019 innocent people with pitchforks and accusing them of bein\u2019 thugs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, maybe you should\u2019ve told me who you were right away . . . and stop wearing knit hats in the middle of the summer. Obviously my sister didn\u2019t tell us she had a stepson, so I wasn\u2019t expecting you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t tell me she had a sister, either. And it\u2019s called a beanie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever. It threw me off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you so serious? Loosen up.\u201d I wag my foot again. \u201cIf it\u2019ll make you feel any better, you can rub my foot for ten minutes and we\u2019ll call it even.\u201d</p><p>She eyes my toe as if I have a fungus. \u201cYou think this is funny, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEntertaining is more like it.\u201d I look down at my foot. \u201cSo I assume the foot rub is out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just get one thing straight, Cowboy.\u201d She eyes my collection of boots lined up in the corner. \u201cYou might be used to getting girls to rub your feet or do whatever you want by flashing that smile or showing your six-pack, but it\u2019s not gonna work with me. I\u2019m around football players all day, so seeing a fit body is like seeing a statue. It doesn\u2019t do anything for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me, then. What does it take to get your attention?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t you like to know.\u201d</p><p>Yeah. And I have a feeling I\u2019m gonna find out real soon.</p><p>I can tell Ashtyn is a girl who plays by her own rules and refuses to acknowledge that there\u2019s some kind of electricity flying between us. The more she protests, the more I know I\u2019ve gotten under her skin. I\u2019m about to say some cocky comment until Falkor groans, then stretches out and starts lapping away at his balls. \u201cYour dog has issues.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe all have issues.\u201d She stares me straight in the eye. \u201cBut don\u2019t try to figure me out or get into my business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAshtyn, the last thing I\u2019m gonna do while I\u2019m here is get into your precious business. Or your issues, whatever they are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d She tosses her braid back. \u201cThen we\u2019re on the same page.\u201d</p><p>Brandi peeks into the room, her big earrings swaying from side to side. \u201cDerek, how\u2019re you feeling?\u201d she asks, concern laced in her voice. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAshtyn was just about to give me a foot rub. Why didn\u2019t you tell me your sister was as sweet as sugar pie?\u201d</p><p>Brandi puts her hand to her heart. \u201cAww. It\u2019s super cool that you\u2019re so forgiving, Derek. I made dinner and it\u2019s ready whenever you are.\u201d</p><p>When Brandi leaves, Ashtyn puts her hands on her hips and raises a brow. \u201cSugar pie, my ass,\u201d she says, then storms out.</p><p>In the kitchen, Brandi\u2019s dad sits at the head of an oak table surrounded by six wooden chairs. Julian is stuffing his face with mashed potatoes I\u2019m sure are processed and probably don\u2019t have actual potatoes in them. I don\u2019t think Brandi has ever made anything that hasn\u2019t come from a box. Ashtyn is sitting across from Julian. She glances up and our eyes meet. When I raise a brow, she quickly gazes down at her food.</p> <p>\u201cHave a good nap, buddy?\u201d I ask Julian as I wash my hands in the sink and pretend Brandi\u2019s sister doesn\u2019t make me want to find out what it would take to get her attention just for the satisfaction of knowing I can.</p><p>Julian nods. I catch a tiny hint of a smile on his face when I mess up his hair and slide into the chair next to him\u2014and across from Ashtyn.</p><p>I scan the food on the table. Chicken fingers that don\u2019t look like they actually came from a chicken, \u201cjust add water\u201d mashed potatoes from a box, and corkscrew pasta smothered with canned Alfredo sauce. I\u2019ve got to go grocery shopping with Brandi and introduce her to vegetables and chicken that aren\u2019t processed to death. Obviously eating healthy is not part of the Parker household plan.</p><p>Neither is conversation.</p><p>It\u2019s silent except for the sound of silverware clinking on the plates and the occasional cough. Is this typical? My dad always has crazy stories to tell and will yank conversation out of you even when you don\u2019t want to talk. It\u2019s a talent he was born with, or maybe it\u2019s some interrogation technique he learned in the military. Either way, it\u2019s a skill I don\u2019t have. I\u2019m tempted to fling mashed potatoes across the room to liven up the evening, which is more my speed. Would Ashtyn follow along, or would the warrior girl try to stab me with her fork instead?</p> <p>Ashtyn is the first to speak. \u201cI was voted captain of the football team today,\u201d she says. I detect a quiet, almost unrecognizable pride in her voice.</p><p>\u201cWow!\u201d I nod, impressed.</p><p>\u201cYou play flag football?\u201d Brandi asks. \u201cThat\u2019s cute. I played on the powderpuff team when I was in\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not flag football,\u201d Ashtyn interjects. \u201cI play varsity for Fremont. You know, the one without the flags.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour sister has become a tomboy,\u201d Gus chimes in.</p><p>\u201cAre you a lesbian?\u201d Brandi whispers loudly.</p> <p>I try to hold in my laughter, but I\u2019m not doing a great job.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not a lesbian,\u201d Ashtyn says. \u201cI have a boyfriend. I just . . . like to play and I\u2019m good at it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDerek used to play football,\u201d Brandi says.</p><p>\u201cA while ago,\u201d I say quickly, hoping to cut Brandi off before she elaborates. Ashtyn doesn\u2019t need to know the truth, because the truth doesn\u2019t matter. Not now, anyway. I hope Brandi doesn\u2019t blab my entire history. \u201cI was average,\u201d I mumble.</p><p>The girl wielded a pitchfork, so I shouldn\u2019t be surprised she plays football. But I am.</p><p>Brandi waves her hands excitedly, getting our attention. \u201cAshtyn, I have the best idea. Why don\u2019t you, like, take Derek out and introduce him to your friends tonight?\u201d</p><p>Ashtyn\u2019s eyes lock on mine. \u201cI kinda have plans, but, umm . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to entertain me. I\u2019m not really up for a late night after drivin\u2019 for the past week, anyway. I\u2019m fixin\u2019 to go for a run and knock out early.\u201d I don\u2019t need to be babysat, that\u2019s for damn sure.</p> <p>\u201cLake Michigan isn\u2019t far,\u201d Brandi chimes in. \u201cYou can run on the beach. It\u2019ll make you feel like you\u2019re back in Cali.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d bet my left nut that Chicago beaches are nothing like the beaches in Cali.</p><p>\u201cOr the school track,\u201d Ashtyn pipes in too enthusiastically. \u201cEveryone runs on the school track. The beach gets crazy crowded at night. You definitely don\u2019t want to go there.\u201d</p><p>Uh-huh. She\u2019s definitely going to be hanging at the beach tonight.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your plan?\u201d Gus asks Brandi. \u201cYou don\u2019t expect to sit around here all day, do you?\u201d</p><p>Time for her to break the news that she\u2019s prego.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll apply for a job at Debbie\u2019s salon after Julian starts kindergarten and Derek starts his senior year at Fremont.\u201d Brandi stabs her fork into a piece of chicken. \u201cI figure Debbie will hire me to do nails after I get certified this summer.\u201d</p><p>Her dad shakes his head in disapproval. \u201cSeems to me like you should apply to the community college and take some real classes so you have options besides making minimum wage doing nails. This marriage of yours might not work out, you know.\u201d</p><p>Gus doesn\u2019t hold back anything. While I might have had the same thought before I knew Brandi was pregnant, I wouldn\u2019t have mentioned it. I look over at Julian, who\u2019s got his attention squarely on his food. In an attempt to make sure he doesn\u2019t pay attention to more of the conversation, I balance a piece of chicken on Julian\u2019s knee and watch as Falkor eats it off him and licks him. Julian giggles.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not good at real school, Dad. You know that.\u201d Brandi bows her head. Her usual optimism might be irritating, but now she looks like her spirit is broken as she mumbles, \u201cAnd my marriage is just fine, thank you very much.\u201d Brandi doesn\u2019t spill the news about her pregnancy. Instead, she shakes her head and looks defeated.</p><p>Nice going, Gus. I motion for Julian to feed Falkor more table scraps, hoping the dog doesn\u2019t mistake his little fingers for mini hot dogs.</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t good at school because you didn\u2019t apply yourself,\u201d Gus continues. \u201cIf you\u2019d spent half as much time studying as you did chasing boys and getting in trouble, you\u2019d already have a college degree.\u201d</p><p>Ashtyn slaps a hand over her eyes and shakes her head, completely embarrassed.</p><p>Brandi puts down her fork and stares at her dad. \u201cAre we going through this again? \u2019Cause we can walk out that door and never come back, just like practically everyone else in your life.\u201d</p><p>Gus stands, his chair scraping the kitchen floor so loudly Julian covers his ears. Gus storms out of the kitchen. The front door slams and his car tires squeal a minute later as he drives off.</p><p>One look at Brandi and Ashtyn is enough to make me want to escape from the room like Gus just did. Julian doesn\u2019t seem to be faring any better.</p><p>Ashtyn stares at her sister accusingly.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Brandi says innocently. \u201cDad started it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you started it when you left seven years ago,\u201d Ashtyn tells her. I can feel her resentment from across the table. Man, I\u2019m in the middle of some civil war here.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not fair,\u201d Brandi says.</p><p>Ashtyn rolls her eyes. \u201cWhatever, Brandi.\u201d</p><p>I catch a tear running down Brandi\u2019s face. She swipes it away, then leaves the table. Julian runs after her, leaving Ashtyn and me alone.</p><p>\u201cY\u2019all should audition for the new reality show where they eliminate the least dysfunctional family each week,\u201d I tell her. \u201cI think you guys got a decent chance of winnin\u2019 the million.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re part of this dysfunctional family,\u201d Ashtyn shoots back.</p><p>I look at her, amused. \u201cWhat makes you think that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOtherwise, you would have stayed in California and not followed Brandi here. You\u2019d be with your own mom. Your biological one, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not really possible.\u201d I push myself away from the table. \u201cShe\u2019s dead. What\u2019s your excuse for not living with your mom?\u201d</p><p>Chapter 6</p><p>Ashtyn</p><p>I didn\u2019t answer. I couldn\u2019t, because I\u2019ve never been able to say out loud why my mom\u2019s not living here anymore. Truth is, she left because she got sick of being a wife and mother. I don\u2019t talk about my mom with anyone, not even Landon.</p><p>I should have known better than to ask Derek about his mom. I feel awful that I brought it up. If I knew his mom wasn\u2019t alive I wouldn\u2019t have mentioned it. His answer hung in the air long after he cleared his plate and left me alone in the kitchen. I wanted to call him back and apologize, but ever since I laid eyes on him my defenses have been up and my mouth has gone into overdrive.</p><p>Julian looks at Derek as if he\u2019s some superhero. I can\u2019t mention football without my sister mentioning that Derek played. Then she wants me to entertain him. Next thing I know my dad\u2019ll probably start watching football games with him.</p><p>I wanted to kick myself for attempting to look into his eyes more than a few times tonight. It\u2019s not because I\u2019m attracted to him. It\u2019s because they\u2019re a unique color, that\u2019s all.</p><p>When my dad told me Brandi was moving back home, I hoped maybe we could become a family again. I imagined Julian and I would immediately bond. Instead, thanks to Derek, my nephew thinks I\u2019m his crazy aunt. It\u2019s time I change that perception.</p><p>I find Julian in my sister\u2019s room, playing with a handheld video game.</p><p>\u201cHey, Julian!\u201d I say.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t stop playing. \u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know Derek said I was crazy, but I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>Julian looks up from his game. \u201cI know. He told me he was joking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d I sit next to him. Besides his blond hair, he\u2019s the spitting image of Nick. Supposedly Nick left my sister after he found out she was pregnant. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s seen him since, which means Julian has never met his biological father.</p><p>\u201cCan I have a hug?\u201d I ask him.</p><p>He shrugs.</p><p>\u201cAll right. Well, when you feel like giving me one, I\u2019ll be waiting for it. Okay?\u201d</p><p>He nods, his attention still on the game.</p><p>I sit with him for fifteen minutes, until my sister comes in and tells him to get ready for bed. My sister acts like our argument in the kitchen didn\u2019t happen, but it\u2019s still fresh in my mind.</p><p>Landon hasn\u2019t called me, even though we\u2019re supposed to hang at the beach tonight. I walk to my room, close the door, and call my boyfriend.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Landon answers.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry I rushed out of Dieter\u2019s meeting and didn\u2019t call. I had to get home to help my mom with some stuff,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re not upset?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe captain thing. I totally expected you to get voted captain, not me.\u201d I know he did, too. I can\u2019t help but feel twinges of guilt, like I took his spot even though I had nothing to do with it.</p><p>\u201cWhatever. It\u2019s not a big deal.\u201d</p><p>But it is. I guess I\u2019m waiting for him to say I\u2019ve worked hard and deserve to be captain just as much as anyone else, but he doesn\u2019t.</p><p>On top of the captain thing, my sister\u2019s homecoming and the argument I had with her are totally stressing me out. \u201cCan we hang out alone tonight? My sister came home this morning, and I guess I\u2019m just having a hard time with it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cEveryone\u2019s meeting up at the beach,\u201d Landon says.</p><p>\u201cI know, but I\u2019m feeling kinda . . . I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, you were always pissed your sister left. Now she\u2019s back. You should be happy, Ash. You got what you wanted.\u201d</p><p>It doesn\u2019t feel how it should, though. \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d I don\u2019t want to be the whiny girlfriend. Landon told me that his ex-girlfriend Lily, who goes to our rival school in Fairfield, complained all the time. He\u2019d said nothing was ever good enough for her and she smothered him to death. I told myself I\u2019d never be like his ex. I\u2019m the happy-go-lucky girlfriend, even when I don\u2019t want to be. \u201cWhen will you be here?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll pick you up in fifteen,\u201d Landon says, then hangs up.</p><p>I rush to get dressed, knowing I can\u2019t very well go out with Landon wearing a T-shirt and hoodie. I try on seven different outfits before calling Monika. I\u2019m not good when it comes to fashion, but my best friend is an expert. I text her pictures of each outfit and she picks one: jean shorts and a short, low-cut pink shirt that reveals cleavage and a hint of skin above the shorts\u2019 waistband.</p><p>In the bathroom, as I lean over the sink to put on my lip gloss, Derek strolls in.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you knock?\u201d I ask him.</p><p>\u201cNo need to knock if the door\u2019s open.\u201d He leans against the shower door and focuses on me with his bright blue eyes. \u201cHot date?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith your boyfriend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe play football, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that it\u2019s any of your business, but yes.\u201d I turn to face him and wish he had some blemish or imperfection, but I can\u2019t find one. Ugh, the girls at school are gonna have a field day when they take one look at him. I imagine a lot of drama and fighting over him. \u201cDid you barge in here for a reason, or did you just want to rub it in that I have to share a bathroom with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to relieve myself. Do you mind?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEww.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou act like you\u2019ve never done it before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve done it. I just don\u2019t have the need to announce it.\u201d I grab my stuff and start to walk out, but turn back and say, \u201cDon\u2019t you dare leave the toilet seat up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if I do?\u201d he asks with a smirk.</p><p>\u201cTrust me, you don\u2019t want to find out.\u201d</p><p>In my room, I wonder if Derek has a girlfriend and imagine what she might look like. Not that I care. I\u2019d actually feel sorry for the girl who has to deal with a guy who\u2019s too sarcastic, too witty, and too good looking.</p><p>The doorbell rings a few minutes later. I can\u2019t wait to see Landon\u2019s expression when he sees me all dressed up.</p><p>\u201cBe right down!\u201d I call out, then grab my purse and rush downstairs.</p> <p>Landon is waiting for me in the foyer wearing jeans and a preppy button-down shirt that covers his dark-skinned body. I give him a peck on the lips just as Derek appears wearing long shorts with REGENTS PREPARATORY ACADEMY embroidered on the leg. I\u2019m not surprised he comes from a fancy prep school with that ego of his. He\u2019s shirtless once again, showing off solid muscles and an air of confidence that rival Landon\u2019s. I\u2019m not immune to him even though I said I was. There\u2019s just something about Derek that draws my gaze to him, even though I hate myself for acknowledging it.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019re you?\u201d Landon asks, as if Derek\u2019s an intruder who needs to be kicked out of my house immediately.</p><p>\u201cJust a thug from Cali,\u201d Derek says with a wink for me, then pushes open the screen door and saunters outside with a pair of running shoes in his hand.</p><p>Landon points to the door. \u201cWho the hell was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s Brandi\u2019s stepson.\u201d I wave my hand in the air, dismissing the importance of the guy living in our den. \u201cDon\u2019t pay any attention to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStepson?\u201d He glances at Derek through the screen. \u201cI don\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe neither.\u201d I grab Landon\u2019s hand and urge him out of the house. My boyfriend is competitive and definitely has a high testosterone level. He doesn\u2019t mind me hanging out with our teammates, but he\u2019s jealous of outsiders. Derek is definitely an outsider. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s go celebrate the beginning of summer break. I need a distraction.\u201d</p><p>Outside, Derek is sitting on the stoop tying his shoes. \u201cY\u2019all have fun,\u201d he calls out as we head for Landon\u2019s car.</p><p>\u201cWe will,\u201d Landon growls back.</p><p>From the car, I look over at Derek. Our eyes meet and I feel a jolt of adrenaline. I want to ignore him, to pretend he doesn\u2019t exist. So why do I have such a hard time keeping my eyes averted? I get a sense that there\u2019s sadness behind his eyes, something that I can relate to.</p><p>Landon\u2019s phone is in his cup holder when it rings on our way to the beach. Lily\u2019s name comes up on the screen.</p><p>\u201cWhy is your old girlfriend calling you, Landon?\u201d</p><p>He glances at the phone but doesn\u2019t answer it. \u201cBeats me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never told me you still talked to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe catch up every now and then. It\u2019s no big deal.\u201d</p><p>I wonder why he\u2019d want to catch up with his ex-girlfriend when he always complains about her. I want to ask more questions about how often he talks to Lily and what they talk about, but he drives up to the entrance to the beach and hops out of the car before I can ask him to elaborate.</p><p>I thought Landon and I would find a nice quiet place to sit and talk in front of the bonfire, but he leaves me to hang with some of the guys. I could join him, but I\u2019m getting a weird vibe from him tonight and decide to give him some space. I don\u2019t want to smother him like Lily did.</p><p>Jet has a six-pack in his hand as he stands by Victor\u2019s car with a bunch of other guys. The second Jet sees me, he waves me over.</p><p>\u201cHey, Captain,\u201d he says as he wraps me in a bear hug.</p><p>\u201cCut it out, Jet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know you love me, Ash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t. Most of the time I don\u2019t even like you,\u201d I joke. \u201cGet your paws off me and leave them for the poor, unsuspecting girls who buy your bullshit.\u201d I dig an elbow into his ribs. \u201cLandon\u2019s right over there. Don\u2019t piss him off.\u201d</p><p>Jet laughs. \u201cWhy would I want to piss off our star QB, our pride and joy, the prince, the single most important person on our team, the only quarterback who can take us to State with one hand tied behind his back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLay off, Thacker,\u201d Vic chimes in, shutting Jet up for the moment.</p><p>After we lost in the playoffs, the local paper printed a quote from Landon bashing Jet about not catching his last two passes. Landon said they misquoted him, but Jet still took it personally. Ever since then, the two have been trading barbs and I\u2019ve had to defuse a lot of it to keep the peace.</p><p>Jet points to a girl by the water\u2019s edge wearing a skimpy thong bikini. \u201cWhat are the chances I get lucky with her tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter than most,\u201d I tell him. \u201cShould I warn her that you just want a one-night stand so she shouldn\u2019t expect a call from you in the future?\u201d</p><p>That gets an amused grin out of Vic.</p><p>\u201cHell, no.\u201d Jet doesn\u2019t have girlfriends. He likes to \u201cspread the love\u201d and hook up with as many hot girls as he can. Which also means he\u2019s pissed off more than a good share of the high school female population in Fremont and the surrounding communities.</p><p>A few times Jet has needed my help being rescued from clingy girls desperate to have a real relationship. I\u2019ve reluctantly acted as his fake girlfriend too many times to count. I told him that one day he\u2019ll fall hard for a girl who\u2019ll break his heart, but he laughs it off. He thinks love is complete bullshit.</p><p>I walk to the bonfire where Monika is sitting and think about the conversation Derek and I had in the kitchen. And the fight my dad and Brandi had. And Derek\u2019s stupid abs he flaunted today. And the guilt I have for Landon not being voted captain. I want my brain to stop thinking. It\u2019s on overload.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe my best friend didn\u2019t tell me she was voted captain,\u201d Monika says as she snuggles against her boyfriend, Trey, our star running back. \u201cCongrats, girl!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Trey and Monika have been dating since junior high. They\u2019re completely in love and aren\u2019t afraid of PDA or talking about their future as if it\u2019s a given that they\u2019ll be together forever.</p><p>After my parents split, I gave up on finding true love\u2014something manufactured in movies and books to make people believe in the impossible. Trey and Monika renewed my faith. He looks at Monika as if she\u2019s the only girl in the world. It\u2019s as if she\u2019s his life-line and he\u2019d be lost without her. Monika told me that Trey\u2019s her soul mate. They\u2019re both planning on going to the University of Illinois, although Trey needs a scholarship to the Big Ten school to be able to afford it.</p><p>When Landon sits next to me, I lean into him. \u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d I ask, getting my boyfriend\u2019s attention. \u201cYou look so serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d he says irritably before opening a can of beer and chugging the entire thing.</p><p>I put my hand on his chest. \u201cIs it the captain thing? Because I didn\u2019t know\u2014\u201d</p><p>He swats my hand away. \u201cFuck, Ash, will you stop bringing it up? I\u2019m just pissed off at the world right now, okay? So you were voted captain. Big fucking deal. I\u2019m sure Jet orchestrated it as retaliation for that stupid article in the paper. The joke\u2019s on me, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJet didn\u2019t orchestrate anything.\u201d</p><p>He gives a short, mocking laugh. \u201cYeah, right.\u201d</p><p>His words sting. \u201cPlease say you don\u2019t mean that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. I don\u2019t mean it,\u201d he says unconvincingly.</p><p>I glance at Monika and Trey, who are trying their best to pretend they\u2019re not listening to our argument.</p><p>I try to swallow, but there\u2019s a lump in my throat as I say what\u2019s been on my mind ever since Dieter wrote my name on the board this morning. \u201cYou . . . you don\u2019t think I deserve to be captain, do you?\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t answer.</p><p>Chapter 7</p><p>Derek</p><p>The sun is setting as I jog with Falkor. At the last minute I decided I might as well try to make nice with the beast and give him some exercise. I don\u2019t have a destination, but the hot, fresh air hitting my face loosens my tense muscles.</p><p>Within minutes, Falkor and I pass the high school and the football field right next to it. Memories of my mom watching me play football fill my head. She was always the loudest parent in the bleachers; I swear her lungs must\u2019ve been sore by the end of each game. Even after she\u2019d just had chemo and felt nauseous and tired, she\u2019d be there. \u201cWatching you play is my favorite thing to do,\u201d she\u2019d say.</p><p>I\u2019d do anything to play for her just one more time. Hell, I\u2019d do anything just to talk to my mom again. But that\u2019s never gonna happen.</p><p>The beast and I jog around the track a couple of times before getting bored and venturing through town. As I stop at a red light and follow signs to the beach, I think about Ashtyn. Man, that tight shirt and short shorts didn\u2019t leave much to the imagination. It was a complete transformation from this afternoon, when her body was covered by a big hoodie. Maybe Ashtyn is a chameleon, changing into a new person depending on who she\u2019s hanging with. I wonder if her boyfriend likes her wearing sexy clothes so he can show her off like a trophy. When he picked her up, he looked at me like I was an opponent about to intercept one of his passes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t like her boyfriend,\u201d I say to Falkor.</p><p>The beast stares up at me with gray eyes and pants, his long tongue hanging out the side of his mouth.</p><p>\u201cNext time he comes over you should pee on his leg,\u201d I suggest.</p><p>I\u2019m talking to a dog. I feel like that movie where the guy is stranded on a desert island and ends up talking to a volleyball as if it\u2019s his best friend. I sure as hell hope this isn\u2019t a sign that I\u2019m destined to have Falkor as my only friend while I\u2019m living in Chicago. That would suck more than being stuck in Headmaster Crowe\u2019s office getting lectured for an hour.</p> <p>When we get to the beach, I look out over the calm water. The shoreline is tame compared to Cali, where sleeper waves can take your feet out from under you without warning. I stand at the water\u2019s edge and look across the moonlit water with Falkor at my side. I wonder how my dad feels being surrounded by nothing but water. He told me once that living in a submarine is like escaping the outside world and living in your own bubble. While some guys enlist for money or education or to find themselves, my dad says being in the military makes him feel useful. Everyone has a purpose in life, he once told me. Finding out yours is crucial to knowing who you are and who you want to be.</p><p>What\u2019s my purpose? I haven\u2019t told my dad that I\u2019m going to enlist after I graduate, in an attempt to find my purpose in life.</p><p>As I jog along the shoreline, I come across a small crowd hanging around a fire listening to music and laughing. I recognize Ashtyn immediately. She\u2019s sitting next to her boyfriend, but they both look miserable. The dude\u2019s holding a beer in one hand and is leaning on the other. If she were my girlfriend, I\u2019d have one hand tangled in that long blond hair of hers and the other on her waist, pulling her close so our bodies were pressed against each other as I kissed her until she was breathless. But I\u2019m not him.</p><p>Falkor barks, attracting the attention of more than a few people. Including Ashtyn. Shit. Her distrusting eyes meet mine before she looks away and pretends I don\u2019t exist.</p><p>I end up taking a detour and jog the rest of the way back to the house. I wish the workout made me stop thinking too much, but seeing Ashtyn reminds me of all the crap I have to deal with.</p> <p>\u201cAshtyn isn\u2019t all that,\u201d I tell Falkor.</p><p>This weird sound, kind of like a groan, comes out of the dog\u2019s mouth.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s got a boyfriend. And she can\u2019t stand me livin\u2019 in her house, right?\u201d But she\u2019s got full, kissable lips. And these eyes that seem to change colors with her moods. I can\u2019t shake her from my mind.</p><p>I stop and look down at the dog for confirmation, since he knows her better than me. He\u2019s looking up at me with droopy, clueless eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m talking to a damn dog, and I called her crazy.\u201d I laugh to myself.</p><p>Back at the house I\u2019m trying to find a comfortable position on my air mattress, but it\u2019s not easy. On top of that, I keep imagining Ashtyn\u2019s lips as if they\u2019re some kind of artwork to be admired and analyzed. When I\u2019m finally so beat and bored I can sleep soundly even on this crappy blowup, Falkor jumps onto the bed with me. I\u2019m waiting for the mattress to puncture and explode, but it doesn\u2019t. Within seconds, the beast is snoring.</p> <p>I\u2019ve been dozing for at least an hour when someone bursts into the room. \u201cWhy are you sleeping with my dog?\u201d Ashtyn demands.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d I respond in a sleepy moan. \u201cHe\u2019s sleepin\u2019 with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it enough that my sister and nephew worship the ground you walk on? You want to steal my dog, too? I saw you at the beach with Falkor. I don\u2019t want you thinking he\u2019s your dog. He\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, Sugar Pie, Falkor snuck into my room. I didn\u2019t invite him. You got issues with your family, keep me out of it.\u201d I sit up and note that she\u2019s changed into a hockey jersey and baggy flannel pants with skulls and crossbones on them. It\u2019s a drastic change from what she wore on her date. \u201cJust take your dog and go to bed.\u201d I lie back down and expect her to leave, but I feel her gaze on me. I wish I wasn\u2019t tempted to reach out and pull her close, to shut her up with a kiss that would make her forget that boyfriend. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you call me Sugar Pie again, I\u2019m going to knock you out.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m tempted to say the word on the tip of my tongue. Promise?</p><p>Chapter 8</p><p>Ashtyn</p> <p>I\u2019ve been curled up in bed for the past three hours with my eyes closed tight, wishing my life would stop spinning out of control. Landon and I didn\u2019t get along last night at all. I don\u2019t even know where things stand now.</p><p>I look at my phone to see if he\u2019s called or texted. He hasn\u2019t, although it\u2019s Saturday. He\u2019s probably still sleeping.</p><p>I slowly head for the bathroom. I\u2019m about to sit on the toilet when I\u2019m suddenly off balance and feel like I\u2019m going to fall in. The damn seat is up. I cringe as I set it back down, silently cursing Derek and fully intending to call him out.</p><p>First I need to eat. Then I can confront Derek and head to the field to practice. Though Dieter doesn\u2019t have official practice on the weekends, we don\u2019t want to lose our momentum.</p><p>Derek walks in the kitchen a few minutes after I do, wearing shorts and a T-shirt. His long hair is messed up and he looks sweet and innocent. I know guys like Derek, who look innocent but are just the opposite. Falkor, who\u2019d disappeared from my room in the middle of the night, comes prancing in on Derek\u2019s heels.</p><p>\u201cDid you lure my dog back in your room last night?\u201d I ask in an accusatory tone.</p><p>\u201cHe kept scratching on my door and whining like a baby until I let him in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re stealing him.\u201d</p><p>He shrugs. \u201cMaybe he\u2019s sick of you and wants new company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA dog can\u2019t be sick of his owner, Derek, and I\u2019ll have you know that I\u2019m great company. My dog loves me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you say so.\u201d He rummages through the fridge, pulls out some eggs, then grabs a loaf of bread from the pantry. \u201cWhat happened at the beach between you and Loverboy? Looked like you two were havin\u2019 one hell of a night,\u201d he says in a lazy drawl as he makes himself scrambled eggs and toast.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to my rule about not leaving the toilet seat up?\u201d I counter.</p><p>The side of his mouth quirks up. \u201cI\u2019ve got this condition, you see. It prevents me from being ordered around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. A condition, you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. It\u2019s real serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoh, I feel so bad for you. You poor baby, being told to do something by a female. That must\u2019ve threatened your masculinity.\u201d I pull out a bag of Skittles from the pantry and sort out the purple ones like I always do, then start munching on the rest.</p><p>Derek leans close and whispers in my ear, \u201cNothing threatens my masculinity, Sugar Pie.\u201d</p><p>A tingly sensation zings up my spine when his warm breath touches my skin. I\u2019m momentarily paralyzed.</p><p>He opens the fridge again. \u201cBesides eggs and toast, you got anythin\u2019 in here besides junk and processed food?\u201d</p><p>I pretend he has no effect on me. \u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>Derek sits down with his eggs and toast, but stares at my collection of purple Skittles with those clear blue eyes that belong on someone who doesn\u2019t leave the toilet seat up on purpose.</p><p>\u201cNutritious,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s comfort food,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>He quirks his eyebrow, clearly amused. \u201cIf you say so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUgh. Don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re a health nut.\u201d</p><p>He scoops up a forkful of eggs. \u201cI\u2019m not a health nut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Here,\u201d I say, pushing my collection of purple Skittles toward him. \u201cYou can have the purple ones. I\u2019m allergic to them.\u201d</p><p>He raises a brow. \u201cYou\u2019re allergic to purple Skittles?\u201d he asks, skepticism laced in his voice.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m allergic to purple dye.\u201d I grab an orange one and pop it into my mouth. \u201cBut I\u2019m not allergic to the rest of them. I love Skittles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good with my own breakfast, but thanks.\u201d Derek takes bite after bite of eggs and toast. When Julian walks in, Derek focuses on my nephew. \u201cHey, buddy,\u201d he says. \u201cWant some breakfast?\u201d</p><p>Julian nods.</p><p>\u201cI can help,\u201d I quickly tell Derek. I need to redeem myself so Julian doesn\u2019t think I\u2019m the worst aunt who ever lived. If I have to work hard and long for that hug, I\u2019m gonna do it.</p><p>I start to get out of my chair, but Derek holds up a hand. \u201cI got it.\u201d</p><p>After my mom left, my dad never made home-cooked meals. I had to fend for myself and ate what he brought home from the store: frozen, microwavable food and junk. Obviously Derek\u2019s mom spent more time with him than my mom did with me. While it\u2019s not his fault, I\u2019m overwhelmingly jealous.</p><p>Julian sits in the chair next to where Derek had been sitting. Derek\u2019s presence in my house makes me feel insignificant and unneeded. I might as well be invisible.</p><p>\u201cWant some Skittles?\u201d I wave the bag in front of my nephew\u2019s face in a lame attempt to get him to bond with me. I\u2019ve never seen a kid who didn\u2019t like candy. \u201cIt\u2019s super good breakfast junk food.\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head. My nephew wants nothing to do with me.</p><p>My nemesis puts a plate of steaming scrambled eggs and toast in front of Julian. My mouth waters from the smell of freshly toasted bread. Julian eats, humming enthusiastically with each bite. The tune reminds me of our school fight song, which is chanted by the fans during halftime at our games.</p><p>Thinking of our fight song reminds me that I didn\u2019t look outside to make sure my house hasn\u2019t been tp\u2019d by Fairfield. It was all clear when I went to bed last night, but Falkor slept in the den and might not have heard anything. I pull back the curtains in the living room. My hand flies to my mouth as I take in the sight of my entire front yard.</p><p>No! No, no, no, no, no!</p><p>It\u2019s worse than being tp\u2019d. Worse than I could have ever imagined, and completely humiliating.</p><p>Toilet paper isn\u2019t hanging down like white flags waving from branches of every tree. Instead, hundreds of maxi pads are stuck to the tree trunks, and tampons are tied to the branches like a bunch of little Christmas ornaments fluttering in the wind.</p><p>As if that wasn\u2019t sick enough, all of the pads and tampons have fake bright red blood marks on them. Even my mailbox has pads stuck all over it.</p><p>I seethe with anger and burn in embarrassment as I rush to clean up the yard, then suck in a breath when my eyes focus on my driveway. In big letters are two words written in a multitude of pads: FREMONT\u2019S BITCH.</p><p>Chapter 9</p><p>Derek</p><p>Ashtyn cursed a bunch of times, then rushed out of the house like a zombie was chasing her. I find her in the front yard, staring at the mess littering the lawn and the trees.</p><p>Holy shit.</p><p>\u201cGo away,\u201d she cries as she frantically lifts the pads that are stuck to the driveway spelling FREMONT\u2019S BITCH. She\u2019s got what looks like ketchup all over her hands. It gets on her hockey jersey as she piles pads in her arms. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As a guy who appreciates pranks, I\u2019m impressed. This took some serious thought and effort. Retaliation would be fun to plan. But Ashtyn\u2019s breathing hard, like a dragon about to spit fire. She\u2019s not amused or impressed. She\u2019s pissed. I grab a garbage can next to the garage and start untying tampons from the branches.</p><p>She yanks the can away from me. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelping.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s managed to get ketchup on her face and hair. She pushes stray strands out of her face, but that only makes it worse. \u201cI don\u2019t need your help.\u201d</p> <p>I glance at the tampons waving in the air above her. \u201cCome on, Ashtyn. You know it\u2019ll take you twice as long to do it yourself.\u201d I pull a tampon off a branch and wag it at her. \u201cLet go of that big ego of yours and let me help you.\u201d</p><p>She grabs the tampon out of my hand and tosses it into the trash. \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019d find it funny if this happened to you.\u201d Turning her back, she drags the can out of my reach. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you get brownie points by helping my sister or nephew, because you\u2019re so good at that? You\u2019re not earning any with me, so you might as well go back in the house.\u201d</p><p>If that\u2019s the way she wants it, fine. I hold my hands up in surrender. Let her deal with the mess. I know from past experience that getting mixed up with girls like Ashtyn, who take life way too seriously, is more trouble than it\u2019s worth. \u201cYou are one bitter girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on out here?\u201d Gus demands, then turns to me. \u201cDid you have anything to do with this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sir.\u201d</p> <p>Ashtyn keeps ripping pads off the trees.</p><p>Gus huffs and looks at Ashtyn as if this prank is the worst thing that could possibly happen. \u201cI\u2019m calling the police.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad, no!\u201d Ashtyn gives her father a pleading look. \u201cIf you call the police, everyone will accuse me of being a weak girl who can\u2019t handle being team captain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are a girl, Ashtyn,\u201d Gus states matter-of-factly. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you let some boy be captain? Have someone else\u2019s family deal with vandalism to their yard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGus, it\u2019s not her fault,\u201d I say. Maybe they need to hear the voice of an unbiased third party who doesn\u2019t think getting pranked is the end of the world. \u201cIt\u2019s just a prank.\u201d</p><p>Gus turns on me. \u201cJust a prank, huh? Pranks are not funny.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal, Gus. Instead of yellin\u2019 at her, why don\u2019t you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDerek, stay out of this.\u201d Ashtyn stands in front of Gus, demanding all his attention. She stands tall, shoulders back and head high. \u201cDad, I promise I\u2019ll clean everything up before you get home from work. Don\u2019t call the police. Please.\u201d</p><p>Gus shakes his head, completely frustrated as he eyes the yard again. \u201cIf your mother were here, she\u2019d never allow you to be on the football team. She\u2019d sign you up for cooking classes or dance classes or something like that.\u201d</p><p>Ashtyn looks like his words are a slap in the face. \u201cI like football, Dad. I\u2019m good at it. If you\u2019d come to a game or practice and just watch me . . .\u201d</p><p>Her voice trails to a whisper as Gus dismisses her words and walks to his car. \u201cMake sure the yard is clean before I get home, or I will call the police.\u201d He gets in his car and drives off. After he\u2019s gone, Ashtyn takes a deep breath to compose herself, then goes back to taking pads off the trees.</p><p>I start pulling tampons off branches too high for her to reach.</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d I say as I reach around her and toss the tampons in the trash. \u201cJust because you can deal with bullshit on your own doesn\u2019t mean you should.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 10</p> <p>Ashtyn</p><p>\u201cYo, yo, anyone home?\u201d Jet\u2019s human-bullhorn voice booms through the house. Jet never rings the doorbell. If our door was locked, he\u2019d knock so loud he\u2019d put a dent in the door.</p><p>I rush down the stairs, hoping I\u2019ve washed off all the fake blood. It took Derek and me over an hour to clean the front yard. By the end, we looked like victims in a slasher film.</p><p>In the living room, Jet makes himself comfy in my dad\u2019s favorite chair while Trey and Monika sit next to each other on the couch. Victor stands in the doorway with his hands crossed on his chest. I know what\u2019s bothering him, but I\u2019d never reveal his secret.</p><p>I\u2019m still thinking about what I\u2019m going to tell the guys about the prank when Jet says, \u201cWe know your house got tamponed and padded last night.\u201d</p><p>I was hoping the prank happened late enough and I\u2019d cleaned up early enough that word wouldn\u2019t spread. This morning, only a few cars passed our house and only one slowed to check out the scene.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you find out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery guy on the team got pics e-mailed to them anonymously.\u201d Trey holds out his phone, showing me picture after picture of the tampons and pads all over my yard . . . and my driveway with the words that still make me cringe.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re also on the Internet,\u201d Jet adds as he sweeps his hair to the side. \u201cTime to plan revenge, \u2019cause I\u2019m not about to sit back and do nothing.\u201d</p><p>Monika taps Trey on the knee and urges him to tell me something they\u2019ve obviously been discussing before they came here. \u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to figure out is how they got all our e-mail addresses,\u201d Trey says. Monika nods in agreement.</p><p>\u201cSounds like an inside job,\u201d she adds.</p><p>\u201cYou two have been watching too many crime shows,\u201d Vic tells them.</p><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be hard to get our team roster and e-mails. Some people who live on the south side of Fairfield go to Fremont.\u201d Jet moans. \u201cI\u2019m fucking starving. What\u2019ja got to eat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot much,\u201d I tell him, but he heads to my kitchen anyway, stating that he can\u2019t think without eating first. The guy eats a ton and is the leanest and fastest guy I know, burning off calories with his endless amount of energy. One of his dads is a chef, so why he\u2019d want to eat something from my house is beyond me.</p><p>We all follow Jet into the kitchen. Derek is sitting at the table, typing on his laptop.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d Derek gives a short wave to the guys.</p><p>Victor eyes Derek suspiciously while Jet asks, \u201cWho\u2019re you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s Derek . . . my sister\u2019s stepson,\u201d I explain before rummaging through our pantry and pulling out random crap to feed the guys. My teammates don\u2019t care if I feed them healthy food or not . . . anything fuels them.</p><p>I can almost hear the wheels turning in Jet\u2019s head. I wish I could tape his mouth shut to prevent him from talking, but that would require me having the strength to hold him down long enough. \u201cWait. Ash, that makes him your step-nephew.\u201d Jet laughs, completely amused. \u201cThat is hella fucked up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about it,\u201d Derek mumbles.</p><p>Jet grabs a handful of the purple Skittles still in a pile on the table and pops them into his mouth. \u201cWe gotta come up with a plan, Ash,\u201d he says, munching. \u201cThose motherfuckers at Fairfield gotta know not to screw with us.\u201d</p><p>My sister walks in with her big hair piled on top of her head in a messy bun. She glances at the guys. \u201cWhat plan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRetaliation,\u201d Jet chimes in before I can give him a signal not to mention anything.</p><p>Brandi wags her finger at Derek, something my mom used to do to us. \u201cDon\u2019t you even think of getting involved,\u201d she tells him. \u201cRemember what happened the last time you pulled a prank?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Trey asks.</p><p>Derek shakes his head as my sister prepares to give us the scoop. \u201cHe got expelled for letting pigs loose during the senior graduation.\u201d</p><p>Expelled? When I saw Derek in his Regents Academy shorts yesterday, the last thing I expected to hear was that he got kicked out.</p><p>Jet laughs heartily and gives Derek a fist-pump. \u201cThat\u2019s epic, man.\u201d</p><p>My sister turns to Jet with her hands on her hips, looking more like a mom than a girl who used to be a pothead and dance around the house in her underwear on a daily basis. \u201cIt\u2019s not epic. It\u2019s, like, not okay at all.\u201d She directs her attention to Derek. \u201cDon\u2019t do anything stupid with my sister\u2019s friends.\u201d</p><p>Derek gives her a two-fingered mock salute.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet that dude Bonk was the mastermind,\u201d Vic says after my sister grabs a cup of coffee and leaves the room. He\u2019s still eyeing Derek as if he\u2019s some superspy who\u2019s not to be trusted.</p><p>\u201cJust so we\u2019re all clear, my man isn\u2019t fighting anyone,\u201d Monika says. She lovingly cups Trey\u2019s cheeks in her hands. \u201cNobody\u2019s gonna mess up this gorgeous face. Right, baby?\u201d</p><p>They start to kiss and do some baby talk.</p><p>Vic looks away.</p><p>Jet rolls his eyes and pretends to gag. \u201cSeriously, guys, get a room.\u201d</p><p>I nudge Jet. \u201cLeave them alone. When you fall for a girl, you won\u2019t be any different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank goodness that\u2019ll never happen. If it does, shoot me and put me out of my misery.\u201d</p><p>Victor gets a text and swears under his breath. \u201cI gotta go.\u201d</p><p>Jet holds up his hands. \u201cAm I the only one ready to come up with a plan to kick some Fairfield ass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should, you know, not retaliate and show we\u2019ve got more class,\u201d I offer.</p><p>\u201cWho said we have class?\u201d Jet asks. \u201cNot me. Ash, you\u2019re delusional if you think our teammates voted you captain because they expect or want you to act classy. Let\u2019s face it, if we voted for the best-looking guy on the team I would\u2019ve won.\u201d</p><p>Monika raises her hand, but keeps her eyes locked on Trey. \u201cI disagree. My baby\u2019s the best-lookin\u2019 guy on the team.\u201d</p><p>Jet laughs. \u201cYou\u2019re biased. Yo, Parker, you really wanna know why you were voted captain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d I\u2019m sure Jet\u2019ll say I\u2019ve got the biggest boobs or something crude like that. Or say that he rigged it like Landon claimed, which would make me feel awful and undeserving. I want to know the truth . . . I just hope the truth isn\u2019t what Landon thinks it is.</p><p>\u201cI want to know,\u201d Derek chimes in.</p><p>Jet puts his arm around me and pulls me close, squeezing me like a stuffed doll. \u201cShe got voted captain \u2019cause she\u2019s the best-lookin\u2019 chick on the team.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the only girl, Jet,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not done. She also got voted captain because she\u2019s got major balls for a girl. She doesn\u2019t give up or cry every time she gets bruised, cut up, or roughed up on the field. She brings her A game every fucking time. She motivates us, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d He looks at Derek and says, \u201cThis girl here tried out freshman year. There were bets made that she\u2019d quit within a week. I should know because I was one of those people who lost money on that bet. I\u2019m not sayin\u2019 some of the guys didn\u2019t try to make her quit, yours truly being one of them, but she never gave up. She earned our respect.\u201d He eyes my chest. \u201cAnd she\u2019s got the best set of tits on the team.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter 11</p><p>Derek</p><p>At the mention of Ashtyn\u2019s chest, I look away and pretend I\u2019m interested in the rest of the purple Skittles. I don\u2019t want to notice Ashtyn\u2019s chest, or any of her other body parts, for that matter. I\u2019m already too aware of the girl as it is. Paying attention to her female parts is not an option, for more reasons than the obvious.</p><p>I close my laptop when the big Latino guy calls out, \u201cDerek, wait. How about helping us out?\u201d</p> <p>Ashtyn says, \u201cWe don\u2019t need any help, Vic. Besides, you heard what my sister said. Derek is forbidden to help us.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, but that just makes me want to break the rules even more. \u201cWhat kind of help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRetaliation for messing up Ashtyn\u2019s yard.\u201d</p><p>Jet, the self-declared best-looking dude with a big mouth, says, \u201cWe gotta come up with a plan so they know not to screw with us. We could use any ideas you\u2019ve got.\u201d</p><p>Ashtyn steps between me and the guys. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have any ideas. Right, Derek?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRight.\u201d I burst her short-lived moment of triumph. \u201cBut I\u2019ll work on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you won\u2019t,\u201d she orders as her teammates say, \u201cGreat\u201d and \u201cLet us know if you come up with anything.\u201d</p><p>Ashtyn shoots me a glare, then pats each of her friends on the shoulder. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk about this later. It\u2019s team business. You guys go do drills. I\u2019ll be there in a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>After they file out, Ashtyn leans on the table, her face close to mine. I wish to hell Jet hadn\u2019t mentioned her breasts, because the way she\u2019s leanin\u2019 I have a good view of her lacy pink bra.</p><p>\u201cYou seem to think I need a savior.\u201d I have a hard time concentrating on her words and not her bra. \u201cI don\u2019t. And while I appreciate you helping me clean the mess in my yard, I was more than capable of doing it myself.\u201d</p><p>I pick up my laptop. \u201cI\u2019m no savior.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen what\u2019s your agenda, Cowboy?\u201d she continues. \u201cBesides annoying me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t got one,\u201d I say. \u201cAnnoying you has taken up so much of my time since I got here, I reckon I don\u2019t have much time for any-thin\u2019 else.\u201d</p><p>I walk out, hoping I\u2019ll forget about that lacy pink bra and the girl who\u2019s wearing it. Lying on my blow-up bed, I open my laptop again. I intend to watch random videos, but instead I search online for the pictures of Ashtyn\u2019s front lawn. It doesn\u2019t take long to find them. They\u2019re on some bogus profile created this morning, someone claiming to be a Fremont student named Booger McGee. Pictures of the tampons and pads strewn on the lawn were uploaded today. Ashtyn is tagged in the picture marked FREMONT\u2019S BITCH.</p><p>One picture is taken from the street to showcase the entire mess. A few others are closer up, showing their artful distribution of the pads and tampons. The pranksters were careful not to out themselves, probably afraid of the consequences of being recognized. Smart, but not that smart. I squint closely at a picture including Ashtyn\u2019s car. There\u2019s a reflection of the front end of another car in her side window. I easily identify the distinctive shape of a Jeep Wrangler with a custom light bar on top. Wranglers can never be mistaken for any other car.</p><p>I tell myself I don\u2019t want to be Ashtyn\u2019s protector. The girl is more than capable of fighting her own battles, and for the ones she\u2019s not capable of fighting . . . well, she\u2019s got a boyfriend and teammates for that. I need to remind myself to stay out of her life even when instinct tells me otherwise.</p><p>Falkor jumps on my lap and paws me. His breath smells like he\u2019s been eating something other than dog food.</p><p>Spending the summer at Regents would\u2019ve been awesome, with parties that would last all night. Now I\u2019m in the suburbs of Chicago living with a stepmother who suddenly wants to make sure I stay out of trouble and a girl with a pink lacy bra who plays football and would like nothing better than for me to fall off the face of the earth.</p><p>Because I have nothing better to do and need an adventure, I decide to drive to Fairfield to see if I can spot the Jeep. It\u2019s easy to infiltrate enemy territory when nobody recognizes you as the enemy. I wear jeans, boots, and a plaid button-down with my beanie to emphasize that I\u2019m not from around here. When I first met Jack at Regents, he asked me if I lived on a ranch because of the way I talked. I might have talked like a cowboy, but I looked like a California dude who surfs and wears beanies. I\u2019ve lived so many places, I don\u2019t fit into any mold.</p> <p>Fairfield is the town next to Fremont. I set my GPS for Fairfield High and find their football field empty. It\u2019s Saturday, but hard-core players practice on weekends. As I cruise the streets on the alert for a Jeep, it doesn\u2019t take long to realize there\u2019s a rich side of town and a not-so-rich side. I turn down one block, then another, where buildings are tagged with gang symbols. The guys hanging out on the street corners look more than ready to sell me drugs.</p><p>I\u2019m about to give up when I spot a red Jeep with a custom light bar parked in front of a sandwich shop called Rick\u2019s Subs. A dude who looks like Ashtyn\u2019s boyfriend, accompanied by some chick, pulls out of a spot and drives off. I take it. Once inside, I sit at the end of the long counter and pretend to look at the chalkboard menu above. This is obviously the Fairfield High hangout of choice.</p><p>A bunch of guys who look about my age are in a booth, laughing and acting like they\u2019re the shit.</p><p>\u201cBonk, upload another close-up,\u201d one of the guys says a bit too loudly. Bonk has a shaved head and piercings in his ears and eyebrows. He tells the guys to keep it down and looks around to make sure nobody is eavesdropping.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019ll ya have?\u201d the waitress asks.</p><p>I glance at the menu again. \u201cI\u2019ll have a meatball sub to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got it.\u201d She calls out my order to the chef, then pours me a glass of water. \u201cYou go to Fairfield? I haven\u2019t seen you in here before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, I\u2019m visiting from California.\u201d I nod toward Bonk and his posse, who now have a crowd around them. \u201cSo, um . . . do those guys go to Fairfield?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure do. Football players. The one with the shaved head is Matthew Bonk,\u201d she adds. \u201cHe\u2019s our star receiver,\u201d she says proudly as if he\u2019s someone famous. \u201cWe won State again this past year. Matthew\u2019s our local celebrity.\u201d</p><p>She goes to take someone else\u2019s order.</p><p>Bonk walks up to the counter. He notices me sizing him up. \u201cWhat\u2019re you lookin\u2019 at?\u201d he asks as if he\u2019s some deity unworthy of my gaze. He\u2019s obviously taking the local celebrity thing seriously.</p><p>Time to have some fun . . .</p><p>\u201cI just . . . wow! Matthew Bonk in the flesh.\u201d I take his hand and shake it with an overabundance of enthusiasm. \u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure finally meetin\u2019 the famous receiver from Fairfield High.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, man.\u201d He pulls his hand away. \u201cWho\u2019d you say you were?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPayton Walters,\u201d I tell him, reversing the name of one of the greatest running backs of all time. The dude is clueless. \u201cI was wonderin\u2019 if I could get your autograph for my girlfriend. She\u2019s a huge fan o\u2019 yours, man. You\u2019d earn me some serious brownie points if she knew I met you.\u201d I grab my napkin and hold it out as the doting waitress eagerly appears and provides a pen. \u201cMake it out to Sugar Pie.\u201d I peer over his arm as he straightens out the napkin. \u201cIt\u2019s what I call her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever floats your boat, dude.\u201d Bonk makes the napkin out to Sugar Pie and signs it: Matthew Bonk, #7.</p><p>\u201cCan I take a picture of you?\u201d I lay on my thickest southern accent. \u201cSugar Pie\u2019ll shit a massive cow pie if I show her a picture of you holdin\u2019 up the napkin with her name on it.\u201d</p><p>Yankees often assume people with southern accents are stupid. What they don\u2019t know is that we use our accents to our advantage when we find it useful. Like now, because Bonk is posing with the napkin as I take a picture with my cell.</p><p>\u201cListen, buddy, I got to get back to my friends,\u201d he says as he hands back the napkin and asks the waitress for a drink refill.</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d I grab his hand once again and shake it hard. \u201cThanks, man!\u201d</p><p>He walks back to his friends and I hear him tell them what a dork I was. After I pay for my sub, I follow Bonk and his buddies outside. They\u2019re standing by the Jeep. One of the guys mentions Ashtyn and suggests they break into the Fremont locker room and hang the leftover tampons on the lockers.</p><p>When they realize I\u2019ve followed them, they look at me like I\u2019m an alien from another planet.</p><p>\u201cThat picture I took was blurry,\u201d I say apologetically. \u201cCan I trouble you for just one more? I swear my girlfriend will pee in her Daisy Dukes when she sees I got a picture of you holdin\u2019 your signature.\u201d</p><p>Bonk rolls his eyes and laughs, but doesn\u2019t protest as I hand him back the napkin with his signature. He leans on the back of his car as if he\u2019s a stud and holds up the napkin. It couldn\u2019t be more perfect, except . . . \u201cCan y\u2019all get in the picture with him?\u201d</p><p>The guys are all too willing to pose for the camera.</p><p>Mission accomplished.</p><p>Chapter 12</p><p>Ashtyn</p><p>Monika comes over Sunday morning with Bree, the two cocaptains of the cheer squad. They want my opinion of a new cheer and a dance routine they\u2019ve made up, as if I possess some insider knowledge of whether my teammates will like it.</p><p>On my front lawn, Bree and Monika start clapping and moving their bodies like they\u2019re made of some secret flexible material. I have no clue how they\u2019re able to move like that. I\u2019m jealous, although neither of them can catch, throw, or kick a football like I can.</p><p>Derek walks outside and heads for the shed. He looks masculine, wearing jeans with cowboy boots and a white tank. Falkor follows closely on Derek\u2019s heels.</p><p>Bree stops her routine. \u201cWho is that?\u201d she asks a bit too loudly.</p><p>\u201cDerek.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s Brandi\u2019s stepson,\u201d Monika tells her. \u201cHe\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuper hot,\u201d Bree interrupts almost breathlessly. \u201cOh, my God. You have definitely been holding out on me, Ash. I love his boots, and that knit hat he\u2019s wearing is so cute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a beanie,\u201d I correct her. \u201cI don\u2019t know anyone who wears one in the summer. It looks stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI disagree one bazillion percent.\u201d Bree is practically drooling over Derek like he\u2019s a hunk of meat to be devoured in one sitting. I\u2019m tempted to ask if she needs a bib. \u201cIf a guy looks like that, he can wear whatever he wants. Introduce me to him, Ash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me, you don\u2019t want to meet him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, I do.\u201d She nods so fast it\u2019s a wonder her head doesn\u2019t just fly right off. Monika and I give each other a knowing look. We\u2019ve been friends long enough to know that when Bree\u2019s on the prowl, there\u2019s no stopping her.</p><p>When Derek reappears, I make a weak attempt to wave him over, hoping he\u2019ll ignore me. Unfortunately, he doesn\u2019t. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDerek, this is my friend Bree,\u201d I say. \u201cYou already know Monika.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Monika. Nice to meet you, Bree.\u201d He tips his head like a perfect southern gentleman. I\u2019m surprised he didn\u2019t call her ma\u2019am.</p><p>\u201cWant to watch us?\u201d Bree asks. She twirls her hair on her finger and flashes Derek a big smile. Oh, man. She totally bought the southern gentleman act. \u201cWe could use another opinion on our new routine. I\u2019m the captain of the cheer squad.\u201d</p><p>Derek flashes her an appreciative glance. \u201cI don\u2019t know much about cheerin\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Monika eyes his physique. \u201cSo, Derek . . . do you play sports?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? With that body?\u201d Bree cocks her head to the side for a better view of Derek\u2019s backside. \u201cWell, then, you must work out. A lot.\u201d</p><p>It sounds like Derek is coughing, but it\u2019s obvious he\u2019s covering up a laugh. \u201cI jog and lift weights.\u201d He shoots me a mocking look. \u201cAnd I try to stay away from ice cream, Skittles, and cookies for breakfast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with a little comfort food?\u201d I ask him. \u201cIt\u2019s good for the soul.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, Derek,\u201d Bree interrupts. \u201cHow do you like Chicago so far? I know we don\u2019t technically live in Chicago, but you\u2019ll get used to us suburbanites claiming Chicago as our own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, I guess,\u201d he answers. \u201cLet\u2019s just say I don\u2019t plan on claiming Chicago as my own. I\u2019m fixin\u2019 to move back to Cali the first chance I get, then join the Navy after graduation.\u201d After glancing at me again he says, \u201cWell, I\u2019m gonna see if I can get the lawn mower started. It was nice chattin\u2019 with y\u2019all.\u201d</p><p>Bree raises an eyebrow after Derek puts his earbuds in his ears and pushes our old, beat-up mower out of the garage.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cDerek is dreamy, Ashtyn. With a body like that he\u2019ll probably end up as one of those Navy SEALs. How sexy is that!\u201d</p> <p>Sexy? Dreamy? Derek is not what dreams are made out of. More like nightmares, where the girl is continually being annoyed by a boy who haunts her. \u201cHe\u2019s not all that.\u201d</p><p>My friend looks at me as if I\u2019m nuts. \u201cUmm, did you take a look at those biceps, and that hair . . . and those eyes? Oh, my God, those blue eyes could make any girl melt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe needs a haircut and was totally showing off his body,\u201d I counter.</p><p>\u201cI, for one, am grateful for his body. It\u2019s beautiful to look at. I\u2019m going to ask him if he wants to hang out tomorrow night. Maybe I can get a look at those abs up close and personal.\u201d Bree practically skips over to Derek in haste, as if another girl will steal him away from her if she doesn\u2019t act fast.</p><p>Soon she\u2019s laughing at something he says.</p><p>\u201cGirls are gonna be all over him, huh?\u201d</p><p>Monika nods. \u201cOh, yeah. He\u2019s no Trey Matthews, but he\u2019s super cute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I put my hands up when she looks at me like I\u2019m nuts. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll admit Derek\u2019s kind of attractive if you\u2019re into that California surfer-slash-cowboy look, but he\u2019s not my type at all.\u201d</p> <p>I look down at my charm bracelet, a reminder of my boyfriend. It doesn\u2019t escape my attention that I haven\u2019t heard from Landon since Friday night when he dropped me off. I should miss Landon more than I do. I don\u2019t know why I don\u2019t. The past few days have been a whirlwind of change, and it\u2019s like I\u2019m trying to catch up but I\u2019m moving in slow motion.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on with you and Landon, anyway?\u201d Monika asks. She\u2019s got a sympathetic look on her face as if she expects me to break down and cry any second. I feel more like screaming at the top of my lungs. \u201cFor a minute I thought you two were breaking up on Friday night.\u201d</p><p>I ignore the feeling in the pit of my stomach, because I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s going on with us. I know he likes his space when he\u2019s stressed out, so I\u2019ve left him alone, but every day we don\u2019t talk I feel more distant and disconnected.</p><p>\u201cLandon and I will be fine. We\u2019ve just hit a rough patch.\u201d</p><p>Monika tilts her head to the side. She gets that look when she\u2019s overanalyzing something. \u201cDo you and Derek have something going on?\u201d</p><p>I can feel my face getting hot just thinking about it. \u201cNo way. Why would you say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d She shrugs. \u201cI just sense a strange vibe between you two, and it\u2019s weird that you\u2019re hating on him so much.\u201d She looks back at Bree and Derek, talking to each other. \u201cLooks like Bree is staking her claim on him already. Look, did you see that? She touches his arm every time she talks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s perfected the art of flirting,\u201d I mumble. \u201cAnd he\u2019s totally falling for it, although maybe she\u2019s the one being sucked into his fake charm. I have a feeling that nothing that guy does is sincere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYo, Bree!\u201d Monika yells. \u201cGet back here so we can show Ashtyn the routine.\u201d</p><p>A car pulls into my driveway and honks, delaying the cheerleading show once again. Monika squeals in delight when Vic parks his big SUV in my driveway and she sees Jet and Trey are in the car with him.</p><p>\u201cEpic,\u201d Jet says, completely amused as he steps out. He\u2019s wearing a baseball cap backward and he\u2019s got cutoff sweats he probably cut himself. \u201cThat\u2019s all I gotta say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s epic?\u201d I ask.</p><p>He looks confused as he brushes his perfectly styled hair to the side. \u201cYou mean you had nothing to do with it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo with what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you it wasn\u2019t her,\u201d Vic says. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t have the balls to do it.\u201d</p><p>That is so insulting. \u201cI have balls, Vic!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew it!\u201d Jet wags his eyebrows and reaches for my waistband. \u201cLet\u2019s see \u2019em, Ash.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes and slap his arm away.</p><p>\u201cYou need to stop having a life and go online more.\u201d Trey pulls out his phone. \u201cSomeone created this bogus profile named Payton Walters and posted pics of Bonk and his teammates holding up signs.\u201d</p><p>Oh, no. I\u2019m almost afraid to ask. \u201cPictures of what?\u201d</p><p>Jet holds out his phone. \u201cHere, take a look.\u201d</p><p>In one picture, Bonk and a bunch of his football buddies are leaning on the back of a Jeep. They\u2019re holding a napkin that says FAIRFIELD SUCKS in big bold letters and the license plate on the car spells out DMBASS. When I take a look at the second picture, I gasp. Bonk is in Rick\u2019s Subs in Fairfield holding up a napkin that reads I WANT TO BE FREMONT\u2019S BITCH. It\u2019s signed MATTHEW BONK #7.</p><p>\u201cWho did this?\u201d I ask the guys.</p><p>None of them fess up. This is crazy. The guys from Fairfield are going to freak when they see the pictures that look professionally Photoshopped. It\u2019s impressive. I wish I\u2019d thought of it.</p><p>\u201cMaybe it was Landon.\u201d After I suggest it, the guys eye each other as if they have big doubts.</p><p>\u201cYeah, right,\u201d Jet says. \u201cYour boyfriend\u2019s such a hero.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you talked to him?\u201d Vic asks me.</p><p>I shake my head.</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d Trey says. \u201cMcKnight\u2019s been MIA since Friday night.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t tell them that he\u2019s been MIA in our relationship, too.</p><p>Chapter 13</p><p>Derek</p><p>On Monday morning I wake up late and realize everyone else is already out of the house. As I eat breakfast, I look out at the neglected backyard. This house sits on a big piece of land, but nobody cares enough to make the backyard look decent. It\u2019s as if they\u2019re making the front look good to put on a facade for everyone who passes by.</p><p>The mower I found yesterday is in crap condition, but at least I got the engine to start up. It\u2019s not gonna be easy to cut the grass since the entire backyard is a haven for overgrown weeds, but I need to busy myself or I\u2019ll go insane.</p><p>I turn on the mower and put on my headphones so I can zone out like I did yesterday when the girls were over and Ashtyn\u2019s teammates came by. My mom used to tell me that music always helped her escape to another place. She used to make me listen to Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong, especially when she was in the hospital going through chemo. At first I hated it, but then those singers became a symbol of her.</p><p>Moving on is fucking tough.</p><p>An hour later I\u2019m sweating my ass off. Little pieces of grass stick to my back, arms, and legs. I look back at my progress, proud that I\u2019ve made a sizable dent. The shed, the place where Ashtyn and I first met, has seen better days. I spotted some old paint in there and figure it\u2019s long overdue for a new paint job.</p><p>As I soap my body in the shower, thoughts of Ashtyn invade my mind, and my body starts reacting. I reach down and fantasize for the moment, glad nobody can read my mind. Afterward, I rinse off and am about to just chill in my bedroom, but Falkor bolts to the front door panting like crazy. The poor guy wants to go out. I put the leash on him and jog toward the football field. The place is like a magnet to me.</p><p>It doesn\u2019t take long to get to the school. The football team is having practice. I watch some players do drills. Immediately I\u2019m thinking like one of them again. I haven\u2019t been on a team in almost two years, but those plays and drills are still so familiar I could run them with my eyes closed.</p><p>Ashtyn is doing sprints. She doesn\u2019t notice me, but when she does I fully expect her to ream me out for taking her dog without permission.</p><p>I watch as she grabs a few footballs and jogs to the opposite end of the field. She moves with grace as she sets up a ball and positions herself. A couple of guys on the sidelines watch her and nod, impressed. I can tell she\u2019s so focused she isn\u2019t aware of anything but the ball and the white goalposts. She kicks the first ball through the posts with ease.</p><p>As she gets into position for another kick, she spots me in the stands. She misses her next two attempts, but keeps trying. She makes six out of ten. Not bad, but nothing to write home about.</p><p>I size up the team, something I used to do to my rivals. It\u2019s easy to spot the head coach\u2014he\u2019s sporting a black-and-gold golf shirt and Rebels cap as he calls out plays. The guy has been ripping into the offensive linemen since I\u2019ve been here, although I\u2019m impressed with their execution. Without solid linemen, the quarterback is vulnerable and the team is weak.</p><p>I turn my attention to the current QB, a lanky guy wearing the number three on his jersey. Number three doesn\u2019t look confident even though he\u2019s got good form. He makes a few plays, but can\u2019t connect with his receivers when the defensive line rushes him.</p><p>Number three buckles under pressure. The problem is that he knows it. He\u2019s stuck in his head. He\u2019s got to stop thinking when he\u2019s in the game and let instinct take over.</p><p>After he repeats the same mistake three plays in a row, the coach grabs the QB\u2019s face mask and gives him hell. I\u2019m too far away to hear his exact words, but I know he\u2019s getting an earful.</p><p>\u201cYo, Derek!\u201d Ashtyn calls out. She throws a perfect spiral into the stands toward me, but I duck and let it fly past. It bounces onto the benches behind me and Falkor sniffs it. I haven\u2019t touched a football since the day my mom died. While instinct tells me to catch it, I\u2019m conflicted. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho said you could take my dog for a walk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe begged me to take him out. He obviously thinks I\u2019m the alpha. You know dogs have a hierarchy.\u201d I shrug. \u201cI\u2019m just sayin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToss the ball back, will ya?\u201d</p> <p>I look at the football, lying there waiting to be put back on the field. I never thought I\u2019d pick one up again. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m committing to play again. It\u2019s just a football.</p><p>I slowly pick up the ball and toss it underhand to her, the familiar feeling of the smooth leather rolling off my fingers a reminder of the past. Most girls I know would be afraid they\u2019d break a nail when a football comes flying at them, but Ashtyn reaches out and catches it without hesitation.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not the alpha. I am.\u201d She tucks the ball under her arm and starts walking back to the field. \u201cI\u2019m just sayin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 14</p><p>Ashtyn</p> <p>I told Derek I was the alpha, but right now I don\u2019t feel like one. I was totally off my game today. Seeing him sitting in the bleachers watching me practice only made it worse because I was self-conscious and too self-aware.</p><p>Fremont\u2019s bitch.</p><p>It\u2019s been two days and those words are still swirling in my head. This morning Dieter called me into his office to tell me he\u2019d heard the rumor about the pictures. He told me to forget about any rivalry and just concentrate on winning.</p><p>Landon didn\u2019t show up to practice. He hasn\u2019t answered my calls or texts, either. Last year he never missed a practice or game. I called him before I left the house this morning, but his phone was off. I assume he received the e-mail showcasing the dreaded pictures of my yard. Why didn\u2019t he stop by my house like the other guys, or at least call or text me to see how I was dealing with it?</p><p>Brandon Butter, a sophomore and our backup QB, had a hard time filling Landon\u2019s shoes. When he got rushed, his passes were all over the place. I didn\u2019t want him to be discouraged, though, so I gave him a pat on the back after practice and told him he showed a great effort. I don\u2019t think he believed me, but it did make him smile and hopefully boosted his confidence. Even a little bit will help.</p><p>Even though early summer practices are optional, I know Dieter is disappointed his star QB hasn\u2019t been on the field. Truth is, we don\u2019t have a competitive backup QB and we\u2019re screwed if Landon gets hurt. He\u2019s such a solid player, nobody\u2019s been too worried about that. Until now.</p> <p>After I wash up in the girls\u2019 locker room, I call Landon again. Still no answer. I text him for the fourth time today, but he doesn\u2019t text back. My heart sinks a little and I get a ping of anxiety. Is he not answering on purpose? Did he call back his old girlfriend Lily instead of me? Ugh, I\u2019m never insecure about our relationship. I refuse to start being insecure now.</p><p>In the parking lot, Derek is leaning against my car with his feet crossed at the ankles.</p><p>Falkor barks a greeting and drools the second he sees me. \u201cCan I have my dog back?\u201d I ask, annoyed my dog seems to think he has a new owner. I grab the leash from Derek and kneel down to pet Falkor behind his left ear, his favorite spot. \u201cIf you want a ride home, my dog\u2019s riding shotgun.\u201d I open the door and let Falkor in the front seat.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d Derek leans into the car. \u201cFalkor, get in the back.\u201d</p><p>My usually stubborn dog obediently jumps into the backseat as if Derek is a dog whisperer.</p><p>I turn on the radio as I drive home.</p><p>\u201cYou might be used to bossin\u2019 people around, but it ain\u2019t workin\u2019 for me,\u201d Derek says.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t hear you,\u201d I lie, then cup a hand over my ear.</p> <p>He turns the radio off. \u201cWhy the attitude? Don\u2019t act as if I asked to be here, \u2019cause I didn\u2019t.\u201d I wonder if he can turn that accent on and off at will. \u201cHell, if I didn\u2019t get expelled and Brandi wasn\u2019t knocked up, I\u2019d have found a way to stay in Cali.\u201d</p><p>Wait a minute. Did I hear him right?</p><p>\u201cMy sister\u2019s p-pregnant?\u201d I ask. \u201cPregnant, as in having a baby pregnant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what bein\u2019 knocked up usually means.\u201d</p><p>I look at him sideways, then keep driving. When I pull into my driveway, I turn to him. \u201cBe honest for once. You\u2019re joking about my sister having a baby, right?\u201d</p><p>He sighs and rolls his eyes as he opens his door. Falkor jumps out after him.</p><p>I stare at the dashboard. My sister, pregnant again? She hasn\u2019t said anything, but I never heard from her once in the last seven years. Since she\u2019s been home, I\u2019ve tried avoiding her like I\u2019ve avoided Derek.</p><p>Brandi is just like Mom. It took me a long time to come to the realization that my mom was never coming back. Brandi\u2019s back, but it\u2019s no use getting close to her when I know she\u2019s leaving again.</p><p>It really irks me that Derek knows more about my sister than I do. And that my nephew prefers Derek over me. And that Falkor follows Derek around like he\u2019s the alpha.</p><p>I glance toward the garage and am shocked to see Landon sitting in his convertible with his sunglasses on. When did he drive up, and how long has he been there?</p><p>\u201cWhere were you today?\u201d I walk toward him as he steps out of his car. I don\u2019t even know what to say after our fight on Friday night. I don\u2019t mention our relationship problems or Lily. \u201cYou ditched practice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy parents made me go to some family brunch thing,\u201d he says. \u201cI couldn\u2019t get out of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d In the past, Landon\u2019s dad would never make him go to a family brunch instead of practice. Landon doesn\u2019t seem to want to elaborate. \u201cDid you see the pictures of my house online? And the ones of Bonk?\u201d</p><p>He nods slowly. \u201cYeah, I saw \u2019em.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you post the ones of Bonk? Nobody else fessed up.\u201d</p><p>He nods. \u201cYeah, but keep it on the down low.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you get them to pose like that? I mean, I can\u2019t imagine Bonk posing willingly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got my ways. So how was practice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cButter is doing drills,\u201d I inform him. \u201cBut the guys are getting frustrated that his throws aren\u2019t accurate and his handoffs are sloppy. You know the team needs you.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a long, uncomfortable silence. I feel a pang of sadness as he reaches out and fingers the bracelet with a heart and football charm he got me for my birthday last year.</p><p>\u201cSorry about Friday night,\u201d he says. \u201cMy old man was on my case about being a leader of the team my senior year and wearing the coveted C like he did when he played.\u201d</p><p>I get it. Carter McKnight was a legend in Chicago when he played. He\u2019s got super high expectations. Landon always wants to meet or exceed them. Up until I was voted captain, he had.</p><p>Coach Dieter made me realize I don\u2019t want to give up being captain. I want to lead and motivate my team. I like knowing my place on the team means more than just being on that roster.</p><p>\u201cI never wanted to take anything away from you, Landon.\u201d</p><p>He avoids looking at my eyes. \u201cSure. Right. I know that, Ash.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s an awkward silence again. I don\u2019t know what to say to fix this . . . fix us. I can\u2019t change what happened or turn back time any more than he can.</p><p>He touches my charm bracelet again. \u201cDid I mess everything up between us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I don\u2019t want another person in my life to leave me. At least if I have Landon, I\u2019m not alone. \u201cBut . . . you made me feel awful Friday night. The whole Lily thing kind of freaked me out, and you haven\u2019t called or texted in days. I don\u2019t know what to think anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust forget about all that.\u201d</p><p>He bends his head down to kiss me. For the moment, everything seems to be fixed. I want to believe him, but it\u2019s hard. Since my mom left, I haven\u2019t fully trusted anyone. Even Landon.</p><p>We talk about practice. I ask if he\u2019s started packing for our Texas trip at the end of the month. We\u2019ve both been accepted to Elite, a football training camp that\u2019s practically impossible to get into. Only top high school players in the country are admitted. The plan is to drive there and stay in posh hotels for free by redeeming the frequent traveler points Landon\u2019s dad has racked up and said we could use.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s the deal with that Derek dude?\u201d Landon asks. He looks over my shoulder. Derek is mowing the lawn while listening to music with his earbuds. I have no clue why he wants to fix our place up. It\u2019s not like my dad cares if the backyard looks nice. Dad mows the front of the house every couple of weeks, so everyone who passes can think that we\u2019re doing just fine. The backyard represents us better.</p><p>\u201cI have no idea. All I know is that we\u2019ve agreed to stay out of each other\u2019s way and I\u2019m pretending he doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d It\u2019s not exactly true. I\u2019m trying to pretend he doesn\u2019t exist, but he\u2019s not letting me do a good job of it.</p><p>Landon gestures to my house. \u201cYour old man home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Probably not, since his car is gone.\u201d He prefers to go to work, where he can drown himself in projects at the accounting firm he works at.</p><p>Landon pulls me close and whispers into my ear, \u201cHow about you and me go up to your room right now? I could use a back rub.\u201d</p><p>Now? I look back at Derek. \u201cMaybe this isn\u2019t a good time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Ash.\u201d He takes my hand and leads me into the house. \u201cYou always say we don\u2019t get enough private time. Let\u2019s make use of it while we\u2019ve got it.\u201d</p><p>In my room, Landon takes his shirt off and sprawls out on my bed. I sit beside him and start massaging his back, kneading his taut muscles.</p><p>\u201cThat feels so damn good.\u201d He moans as I rub his shoulders. \u201cYou totally relax me, Ash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you relax me by rubbing my foot, which is sore from kicking the ball so many times today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFeet gross me out,\u201d he says. \u201cThe only feet I touch are my own.\u201d He turns to face me and slowly slips his hands under my shirt. He unhooks my bra, then rubs his thumbs over my nipples. \u201cI can massage other parts of you, though.\u201d</p><p>I still his hand, because fooling around with him right now is not going to relax me. \u201cLandon, I need to talk about my crazy life.\u201d</p><p>His hands are still on my breasts when he puts his lips on my neck. He kisses my pulse, then licks it over and over. It reminds me of Falkor when he slobbers on my face. \u201cSo talk. I\u2019m listening.\u201d</p><p>When he starts sucking on my neck about to give me a hickey, I push him off me. \u201cYou\u2019re not listening. You\u2019re trying to distract me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. Can I listen to you later? Now all I want to do is mess around.\u201d Within seconds, his pants are unzipped. He glances at his groin, a not-so-subtle cue for me to go down on him.</p><p>I look down at the twitching material of his boxers. \u201cI\u2019m just not into it right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou serious? C\u2019mon, Ash,\u201d he moans in a frustrated voice. \u201cYou know you want it. I want it. Let\u2019s do this.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 15 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Derek</p><p>The bed squeaks above me.</p><p>I look at Falkor.</p><p>He looks at me.</p> <p>I took a break from mowing and came inside to cool off, but knowing Ashtyn and her boyfriend are upstairs fooling around is making me nauseous. \u201cTell me why I have the urge to go up there and kick her boyfriend out of the house?\u201d</p><p>Falkor picks his head up as if he\u2019s going to answer, but instead starts humping one of his stuffed toys.</p><p>\u201cYou need a girlfriend,\u201d I tell the dog. He looks at me with his droopy gray eyes, then cocks his head to the side. I can imagine him saying \u201cYou\u2019re just jealous.\u201d</p><p>When her boyfriend kissed her outside, I didn\u2019t miss the silent \u201cfuck you, she\u2019s mine\u201d vibe he sent me. Ashtyn is oblivious. The guy obviously thinks he\u2019s God\u2019s gift to the universe, with his black Corvette convertible and dark sunglasses he doesn\u2019t even take off when he\u2019s kissing her. That\u2019s like keeping your socks on when you\u2019re having sex\u2014complete douche move. I\u2019m surprised Ashtyn fell for that kind of guy, whose car is an extension of his dick.</p><p>Why I feel protective of Ashtyn is beyond me. The girl can take care of herself and doesn\u2019t need me to protect her virtue.</p> <p>The bed above squeaks again. Shit, I can\u2019t listen to this and stay sane.</p><p>I head back to the yard, ready for round two. I turn on the mower and listen to music.</p><p>Hearing that squeaky bed, knowing that dude is touching her, makes me want to punch him. I\u2019ve got no right to feel this way, which sucks even more.</p><p>After pushing the mower through a patch of overgrown weeds, I look at her bedroom window. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s up with me. I\u2019m not into girls like Ashtyn. She\u2019s not my type. I like girls who just want a good time and don\u2019t take life too seriously. So why do I keep thinking about what it would be like to kiss her and feel her hands on me?</p><p>After Landon leaves and Ashtyn is about to walk back to the house after kissing him good-bye, I take my earbuds out. \u201cPlease tell me you didn\u2019t get back together with him,\u201d I call out from across the yard.</p><p>She eyes me up and down. \u201cPull your pants up. They\u2019re sagging. I can see your underwear.\u201d</p> <p>The girl is a master at avoiding the subject. \u201cI mean, seriously, who wears sunglasses when they kiss a girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho I date and how I kiss is really none of your business.\u201d</p><p>Damn. I shake my head and step closer. \u201cYou know when a guy is bullshittin\u2019 you, don\u2019t ya?\u201d</p><p>She gives an impatient eye roll. \u201cYou should know, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d I\u2019m standing in front of her now. I lift her chin with my thumb and forefinger until our eyes lock. Damn, she\u2019s beautiful. Every time I catch her looking at me, it\u2019s hard to look away. Now isn\u2019t any different. \u201cA guy is bullshittin\u2019 you when he doesn\u2019t look you in the eye,\u201d I say.</p><p>She breaks eye contact. \u201cStop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaking me question my relationship with Landon. I can do that without your help, thank you very much.\u201d She swats my hand away and storms into the house.</p> <p>That was interesting. I\u2019m about to go after her when my cell rings. It\u2019s Ashtyn\u2019s friend Bree.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Bree says when I answer. \u201cI was just wondering if you wanted to go out Saturday night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSaturday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it would be cool if we got to know each other better. You know, because you\u2019ll need someone to show you the ropes at school. Ashtyn\u2019s kind of preoccupied with Landon and football. I can fill in the gaps.\u201d</p><p>The gaps. There\u2019s so many fucking gaps in my life it\u2019s comical. I\u2019ve got to start making changes right now, because if I keep going on the same path I\u2019m liable to go insane.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I tell her, knowing I\u2019ve got to fill in those gaps sooner rather than later. Avoiding Ashtyn is what I need to do to keep me sane. \u201cSounds great.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 16</p><p>Ashtyn</p><p>Parties in Fremont are legendary, especially when they\u2019re at Jet\u2019s house. His dads are out of town for the weekend, so he\u2019s throwing the first bash of the summer. Landon picked me up. I\u2019m determined to make things right between us.</p><p>Landon takes my hand as we walk through the door. Jet is sitting in the living room playing a drinking game he made up called Fact or BS. I\u2019ve played it before. One thing about playing Fact or BS\u2014someone is going to be completely wasted by the end of the night.</p><p>Jet motions for us to join them. It\u2019s obvious they started playing a while ago, because Jet\u2019s eyes are bloodshot and Vic is smiling like he doesn\u2019t have a care in the world. Vic hardly ever smiles. He\u2019s always brooding and pissed that his dad runs his life.</p><p>Jet moves over so we can sit next to him. \u201cYo, Ashtyn. Fact or BS . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not playing, Jet,\u201d I say. The last time we played, Jet got so drunk he started puking all over the place. We thought he had alcohol poisoning.</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon, Capt\u2019n, don\u2019t be such a party pooper. Fact or BS . . . Monika and I hooked up in seventh grade.\u201d</p><p>I look over at Monika and Trey. She\u2019s sitting on his lap with her arms wrapped around his neck.</p><p>That\u2019s an easy one. \u201cThat\u2019d be bullshit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Monika says proudly. \u201cI\u2019m not into pasty white guys. I like my men as dark as I like my chocolate. Right, baby?\u201d</p><p>Trey kisses her. \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just because you\u2019ve never been with a pasty white guy,\u201d Jet says jokingly, making Trey roll his eyes and Monika laugh.</p><p>Jet takes a shot as a bunch of girls from school walk in. Including Bree, who\u2019s wearing a black off-the-shoulder minidress that barely covers her . . .</p><p>\u201cDamn! Bree is definitely looking for some action tonight,\u201d Jet says under his breath and gives a low whistle.</p><p>Derek walks in. Bree looks back at him and smiles, then takes his elbow and leads him to sit with us.</p><p>\u201cHey, guys!\u201d she says, completely excited to have Derek as her date. I don\u2019t miss the stares from everyone else interested in finding out more about the new guy on her arm. Derek didn\u2019t tell me he was coming here tonight. He was holed up in his room and hadn\u2019t given me a clue that he was going out with Bree.</p><p>\u201cDerek\u2019s a Fact or BS virgin,\u201d Landon says. \u201cI think we need to de-virginize him.\u201d</p><p>Jet nods in agreement.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d I protest.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re playing a little drinking game we call Fact or BS. You up for it, Derek?\u201d Landon asks, ignoring me.</p><p>I nudge my boyfriend and give him an angry glare. \u201cLandon, don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Landon gestures to Derek. \u201cYou want to play, don\u2019t you? I mean, if you don\u2019t think you can handle it . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cHit me with it,\u201d Derek says without hesitation as if Landon is challenging his manhood.</p><p>\u201cHere are the rules,\u201d Landon says. \u201cFirst, you have to take a shot. They\u2019re only spiked Jell-O shots. Then you have to answer without thinking.\u201d</p><p>Derek nods. He has no clue the shot has more vodka than Jell-O.</p><p>\u201cI sling a question at you,\u201d Landon explains further. \u201cThen you sling a question at me. For every answer you think is a fact, you take another shot. For every answer that you hesitate on, you take another shot. If you think my answer is BS, you say \u2018BS\u2019\u2014and if you\u2019re right, you don\u2019t have to take another shot. I can challenge you on the BS call, and the group takes a vote. Majority rules.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough,\u201d Derek says, not the least bit intimidated. I don\u2019t tell him that usually you only have to drink if you hesitate, and you don\u2019t have to take a shot beforehand, but Landon seems to be making up his own rules tonight.</p><p>Two bucks going head-to-head isn\u2019t going to end well. I need to stop this game before it starts. \u201cLandon, don\u2019t do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s cool, Ash,\u201d Derek says. \u201cI got this.\u201d</p><p>Bree weaves her arm through Derek\u2019s. \u201cLet them play, Ash. Don\u2019t be a party pooper.\u201d</p><p>I should get up and refuse to watch the disaster about to happen, but Landon has one arm wrapped around my waist and urges me to stay.</p><p>Derek and Landon each down a shot. I predict they\u2019re both going to have one hell of a hangover in the morning and I\u2019m not happy.</p><p>Landon clears his throat. \u201cFact or BS. You trim your ball sac.\u201d</p><p>Derek doesn\u2019t break eye contact with Landon as he picks up a shot glass and downs it in one gulp.</p><p>Derek leans forward. \u201cYou hate that Ashtyn got voted captain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBS.\u201d</p><p>Derek shakes his head at Landon\u2019s answer. \u201cYou\u2019re lyin\u2019. I call BS on your BS.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not part of the game. Fact or BS, you hate living in Fremont.\u201d</p><p>Derek takes another shot, then fires his own question. \u201cEveryone thinks you\u2019re a dick.\u201d</p><p>Landon takes a shot.</p><p>\u201cFact or BS . . . you\u2019ve jerked off to thoughts of my girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLandon!\u201d I cry.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Landon puts his hands up, like he\u2019s completely innocent. \u201cWe\u2019re just playing a game.\u201d</p><p>Derek doesn\u2019t answer or look at me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet that\u2019s fact,\u201d Trey mumbles under his breath.</p><p>\u201cYou want to go there?\u201d Derek asks Landon, all fired up now. \u201cYou really want to get personal like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, let\u2019s go there.\u201d</p><p>Derek downs another shot. \u201cYou\u2019re fucking around with some chick behind Ashtyn\u2019s back.\u201d</p><p>What\u2019s going on? This is completely screwed up, and I\u2019m caught in the middle. Landon is pissed and rushes to his feet. Derek did not just say what I think he just said. It\u2019s a complete lie but now everyone is looking at us.</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d I yell, but nobody\u2019s listening. I give Jet and Vic pleading looks, but Vic is out of it and Jet is too amused to stop this.</p><p>\u201cTake a shot,\u201d Derek says, seemingly content with himself. \u201cYou hesitated.\u201d</p><p>Landon narrows his eyes as he picks up the shot glass and downs it, then slams the glass on the table. Landon does not like being bested, and there\u2019s about to be a showdown.</p><p>\u201cAshtyn\u2019s mine, you know,\u201d Landon says.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you think,\u201d Derek shoots back. \u201cYou\u2019re not the one shackin\u2019 up with her every night.\u201d</p><p>Derek swallows. And glances at me. His lies feel like a hard slap in the face. My face feels hot and the rest of my body feels numb. He didn\u2019t just say that.</p><p>I push past him and run out of the house.</p><p>Chapter 17</p><p>Derek</p><p>\u201cAshtyn, wait!\u201d I call out as I leave the house and rush after her.</p><p>She\u2019s walking down the street.</p><p>\u201cMy life isn\u2019t a game, Derek.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say it was.\u201d I feel the slight slur of my words as the alcohol hits my system. My thoughts are clear for the moment, though. If anyone\u2019s not thinking clearly, it\u2019s Ashtyn. She\u2019d even left her jacket behind, but I grabbed it. \u201cWhat are you blamin\u2019 me for? Landon made me play the stupid game. It didn\u2019t even make sense.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m blaming both of you for coming up with the stupid questions and both of you for making people think about whether or not Landon\u2019s cheating on me or if you and I are getting it on. If you can\u2019t keep your ego in check, stay home.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not going to let her off that easy. \u201cI already told you I didn\u2019t ask to come to Chicago, Sugar Pie. I got suckered into it, just like I got suckered into playin\u2019 your boyfriend\u2019s stupid little game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you not to play, but no! Your ego got in the way of your brain and those shaved balls of yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say I shaved them. I trim.\u201d</p> <p>She looks at me as if I\u2019m nuts. \u201cSame difference. You were supposed to stay out of my life, while I stayed out of yours. That was the deal, but you keep breaking it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow the hell was I supposed to know he\u2019d ask me a question about you? What\u2019s the problem, anyway? Give me a fuckin\u2019 break. Reality check, Ashtyn. I\u2019m a teenage guy with raging hormones who hasn\u2019t had a lot of action lately . . . I admit I jerk off. I\u2019m sorry I got caught up in your boyfriend\u2019s game of who\u2019s got the bigger dick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re insane, Derek Fitzpatrick. Certifiably insane.\u201d</p><p>Drunk is more like it.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you and Landon have somehow managed to involve me in your little game of one-upping each other,\u201d she continues. \u201cYou know people are going to gossip now, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p> <p>I rake my hand through my hair and wish I wasn\u2019t having this conversation. \u201cI don\u2019t really give a shit what the people in this town think.\u201d</p><p>Landon comes out of the house with a bunch of people following him. \u201cAshtyn, come here.\u201d</p><p>Ashtyn looks at me as if I\u2019m the enemy. \u201cJust so you know, you\u2019re my least favorite nephew,\u201d she says through clenched teeth, then walks over to Monika. \u201cTake me home,\u201d she pleads to her friend.</p><p>After she gets into Monika\u2019s car, music from inside the house reminds me that the party is still going strong. And Bree is probably wondering why I didn\u2019t call BS on Landon\u2019s stupid comment about me jerking off while thoughts of Ashtyn race through my brain. I walk through the maze of people until I reach Bree.</p><p>\u201cCan we talk?\u201d</p><p>Bree puts her hand on my cheek. \u201cYou\u2019re so cute. If you\u2019re going to apologize, don\u2019t. I know you were just bullshitting to get Landon off your case. I think you succeeded.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>She kisses me on the lips. \u201cMy pleasure.\u201d</p><p>We stay at the party a little while longer, but soon I\u2019m so wasted all I want to do is sleep it off. At some point Bree wants to leave and we get a ride from someone who didn\u2019t have one too many Jell-O shots. As I walk in the house, I know I\u2019ve got to straighten things out with Ashtyn.</p><p>She made it clear that she doesn\u2019t want to have anything to do with me, so why can\u2019t I erase her from my head? What did I think, just because I feel a connection to her that she\u2019d feel the same way or believe that her boyfriend is unfaithful?</p><p>That\u2019s a joke. It\u2019s actually a good thing Ashtyn resents my presence in her life, because if she didn\u2019t we could really complicate our already complicated lives. I\u2019m eternally thankful the front door is unlocked, but my luck is short-lived. Brandi\u2019s still awake. She\u2019s standing in front of the computer, taking a video of herself. It\u2019s kind of weird that she\u2019s got her shirt pulled up to show off her growing stomach.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m home.\u201d I walk past the office, trying to hide any hint that I\u2019ve been drinking.</p><p>\u201cHey, Derek. I\u2019m recording how big my stomach is every day. I figure when your dad gets home he\u2019ll want to see the progress.\u201d She rubs her bare belly, which is something I definitely didn\u2019t have to see. \u201cI miss him tons. Come record a message for your dad.\u201d</p><p>I wave into the camera and hope he won\u2019t notice I\u2019m wasted when he watches it. \u201cHey, Dad. Hope you\u2019re accomplishing whatever you need to in the middle of the ocean. Peace.\u201d</p> <p>It sucks having my dad so far away, especially knowing I can\u2019t talk to him. When he\u2019s away I feel like he\u2019s an acquaintance, someone on the fringes of my life but not actually in it.</p><p>Before I leave the office, Brandi says, \u201cHow much did you drink tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI smelled it on you the second you stepped close.\u201d She pulls down her shirt to cover her belly. \u201cOkay. Well, I guess I should, you know, tell you that it\u2019s probably not a good idea to drink when you\u2019re underage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you do it?\u201d</p><p>She nods. \u201cYes. I\u2019m probably not one to preach about the benefits of staying away from high school parties. Just . . . don\u2019t go overboard, okay? Or don\u2019t do it at all, which is probably what I\u2019m supposed to say. If your dad knew, I\u2019m sure he wouldn\u2019t be happy\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell him if you want.\u201d At this point, what\u2019s he gonna do? It\u2019s not like he can ground me or take my car away. He\u2019s not here to enforce any kind of rules. Nobody is.</p><p>She shakes her head. \u201cHow about if I leave it up to you to tell him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool.\u201d Life is back to the normal state of abnormality in a matter of seconds. Before I leave I turn back to Brandi. \u201cYou know where Ashtyn is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. She\u2019s upstairs sleeping. Is everything okay between you two?\u201d</p><p>I rub the back of my neck. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want some advice?\u201d Before I can tell her to keep her opinions to herself, she puts her hands up and exclaims, \u201cMy sister lives hard and loves hard. It\u2019s in her nature, just like me.\u201d</p><p>I think for a minute, which is pretty tough to do when I\u2019m this buzzed. \u201cThanks, Brandi.\u201d</p><p>Brandi smiles proudly. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome. Good night, Derek.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Night.\u201d</p><p>When I was younger, my mom used to lie in bed with me and we\u2019d make up stories. She\u2019d start a sentence, and I\u2019d finish it. \u201cThere once was a boy named . . .\u201d she\u2019d start and I\u2019d insert, \u201cDerek.\u201d Then she\u2019d continue, \u201cOne day, Derek wanted to go to . . .\u201d and I\u2019d insert whatever place I wanted and together we\u2019d come up with a wild adventure. Every night she came into my room, and every night we\u2019d continue the ritual. When I got too old for those stories, she\u2019d give me advice about girls, school, football, and anything else that I wanted to talk about.</p><p>Brandi is totally unlike my mom, so I miss her all the more. I just want to be able to talk to my mom one more time, see her smile at me one more time, create one of our mom-son stories one more time. I\u2019d do anything to ask her what to do about Ashtyn, because she\u2019d probably have the answer.</p><p>I guess I\u2019m on my own to figure it all out.</p><p>I strip down to my boxers, curse my trimmed balls, and go upstairs to brush my teeth. On my way out of the bathroom, I remember that I forgot to give Ashtyn the jacket she\u2019d left at the party. After going downstairs and grabbing it from my room, I stand in front of her door. I\u2019d knock softly, but I\u2019m afraid Falkor will start barking like a mad dog and wake Julian in the room next to hers.</p><p>\u201cAshtyn,\u201d I say quietly. The door is slightly ajar. I push the door open further and peek inside.</p><p>Falkor is sleeping at the foot of her bed, a guardian to his princess. I walk in with the sole purpose of putting her jacket on her desk chair, but when I glance at Ashtyn lying in bed with her eyes open just staring at me, I freeze.</p><p>\u201cGo away,\u201d she says bitterly.</p><p>I hold up the jacket. \u201cYou left this at the party. You could pretend to be grateful and say thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. Thank you so very much for bringing back my jacket,\u201d she says sarcastically. \u201cNow please put it down, then please go away.\u201d</p><p>I drape her jacket over the chair. She wants to hate me so much, but why? Suddenly it dawns on me. \u201cI think you like me.\u201d The words are out before I can take them back.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. When you\u2019re ready to admit it, let me know.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 18</p><p>Ashtyn</p><p>The greatest part about having close friends is that they know everything about your life.</p><p>The worst part about having close friends is that they know everything about your life.</p><p>Monika comes over in the morning with two lattes in hand. She hands me one while she sits on the edge of my bed and takes small sips from the other.</p><p>\u201cWant to talk about it?\u201d</p><p>I take a sip of the hot liquid and sigh. \u201cTalk about what? The fact that Landon and I aren\u2019t getting along, or the fact that Derek Fitzpatrick is the bane of my existence?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBane of your existence? That\u2019s harsh, especially for you. Normally you\u2019re the one supporting the guys. You\u2019re like the goto BFF for guys, Ashtyn. You get guys. What\u2019s the problem with Derek?\u201d</p><p>I slide the covers off. \u201cHe brings out the worst in me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is that?\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cI don\u2019t know. He doesn\u2019t take anything seriously. Oh, except what he eats. Did I tell you he\u2019s obsessed with eating healthy?\u201d I throw my hands up. \u201cHe won\u2019t even touch a Skittle. And he leaves the toilet seat up on purpose\u2014just to annoy me. I almost fell in the other day.\u201d I\u2019m getting fired up just thinking about how much Derek has infused his way into my life. I pace while I drink the latte.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s gotten to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about it.\u201d I look at Monika sideways and know what\u2019s going on in her head. My best friend thinks she\u2019s got a knack for interpreting people and situations. \u201cDon\u2019t overanalyze this.\u201d</p><p>Monika downs the rest of her latte. \u201cI won\u2019t. If you don\u2019t over-analyze what I\u2019m about to tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about me and Trey.\u201d</p><p>I sit next to Monika. I\u2019ve been such a shitty friend, so self-absorbed that I\u2019ve neglected asking how my best friend is doing. I guess I just think Monika has this perfect life and perfect relationship with Trey that I don\u2019t expect her to have any issues. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing\u2019s wrong. It\u2019s just . . .\u201d She lies back on my bed and moans. \u201cSo Trey and I . . .\u201d</p><p>I motion for her to continue. \u201cYou\u2019re not breaking up, are you?\u201d I ask when she hesitates. I\u2019ve never revealed to her that Victor has had the biggest crush on her since freshman year. I\u2019ve been sworn to secrecy and would never betray Vic\u2019s trust.</p><p>\u201cNo! Nothing like that. Promise me you won\u2019t tell anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have my word.\u201d</p><p>She sighs heavily. \u201cWe haven\u2019t done it.\u201d She grabs my pillow and covers her face, completely embarrassed.</p><p>I lift up the corner of the pillow. \u201cWhat do you mean? Like sex?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait. I thought you guys did it on Valentine\u2019s Day.\u201d Trey saved for months and planned this super romantic evening. He rented a hotel room and took her to dinner. I helped him plan the night, because he wanted to make sure it was perfect for her. \u201cWhen I asked how it went, you said it was the best night of your life. In fact, I happen to remember you saying it was magical.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI lied.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Monika used to tell me that losing her virginity was no big deal, and if Trey wanted to do it she was all for it. I know they fool around. Most of the time they can\u2019t keep their hands off each other.</p><p>\u201cWe had dinner, then went to the hotel and we were fooling around. It just felt weird and forced, you know. I wasn\u2019t into it.\u201d She starts peeling off her nail polish. \u201cTrey said it was fine and we\u2019d do it when we were both ready, but I know he was disappointed.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s so weird to hear the truth from her, because the way Trey talks when she\u2019s not around, you\u2019d think they were doing it every chance they got. I\u2019ve heard him say they did it three times one night. And they did it at Ravinia under blankets during a concert. And in the back of his car on several occasions; he\u2019d said one time the condom broke. He makes it sound like they have a crazy active sex life, which secretly drives Vic nuts.</p><p>How do I balance the relationship I have with Monika and the friendship I have with Trey and Vic? The guys aren\u2019t just my teammates. They confide in me. Obviously Trey didn\u2019t want to reveal the truth about his sex life. It\u2019s such a guy thing.</p><p>I pat Monika\u2019s hand. \u201cYour secret is safe with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love him, Ashtyn. Seriously, I know this sounds stupid but I totally fantasize about marrying Trey and having kids with him one day. I swear he\u2019s my soul mate. I want to make love with him and he\u2019s always so slow and patient with me. I\u2019m just . . . I don\u2019t know. Maybe something\u2019s wrong with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing\u2019s wrong with you, Monika. You\u2019re just not ready.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI wish my parents didn\u2019t hate him. They can\u2019t even look past the fact that he lives in The Shores.\u201d</p><p>The Shores is the apartment complex on the south side of town. It\u2019s not the safest place to live in Fremont, and there are definitely some gang members living there, but Trey has stayed away from all the crap. His parents might not be the richest family in town, but they\u2019re super close and Trey\u2019s dad is the funniest guy I\u2019ve ever met.</p><p>Monika seems more relaxed now that I know the truth. She pops off my bed like she\u2019s propelled by a spring, then looks out my window. \u201cSo what\u2019s Derek\u2019s story?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. He\u2019s from California, his dad\u2019s in the Navy, he doesn\u2019t eat junk food, and he got kicked out of some academy for letting pigs loose. That\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes he have a girlfriend?\u201d</p><p>I shrug.</p> <p>\u201cDoes he like Bree, or does he have the hots for you like Landon suggested?\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cI assure you he doesn\u2019t have the hots for me. He just likes to piss me off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s foreplay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re crazy. Listen, I know you want to be some sort of superspy or FBI investigator one day, but Derek is off-limits as a subject.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust . . . because. I don\u2019t want him interfering in my life, and I promised not to interfere in his. It\u2019s that simple.\u201d</p><p>My best friend laughs. \u201cDoesn\u2019t sound like a good enough reason to me.\u201d She puts her hand on my shoulder. \u201cListen, my friend. I think we need to do a reconnaissance mission and find out more about the guy living in your den.\u201d She heads downstairs with purpose and determination.</p><p>I hurry after her. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to spy on him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s not cool and probably illegal.\u201d</p><p>The door to the den is open. Monika walks inside without hesitating. \u201cKeep a lookout and let me know if he\u2019s coming,\u201d she instructs.</p><p>\u201cFor the record, I\u2019m against spying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the record, you\u2019re curious about what I\u2019m going to find.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t argue with her there.</p><p>My heart is racing as I peek through one of the windows in the den and watch Derek push our lawn mower through the tall grass. He\u2019s got his shirt tucked into his back pocket and his muscled back is glistening with sweat. I duck so he can\u2019t see me watching him if he happens to look in this direction.</p><p>\u201cHe sure does like boots.\u201d Monika holds up a brown leather boot. When she puts it back down, a bunch of hundred-dollar bills fall out. \u201cWhoa. He\u2019s loaded. Where did he get the money from?\u201d she asks as she shoves the bills back in the boot.</p><p>\u201cI have no clue. Let\u2019s get out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait. Well, well . . . lookie here!\u201d Monika says as she lifts the top of Derek\u2019s suitcase. \u201cSeems like your boy wears boxer briefs, wears Calvin Klein cologne, and plays poker. Maybe he won all that money playing poker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoker?\u201d</p><p>Monika reaches in his suitcase and pulls out a bunch of poker chips. \u201cYep. He\u2019s obviously a gambler.\u201d</p><p>She abandons the suitcase while I glance back at the window. Derek is now gathering the cut grass and shoving it into bags. She peeks into some boxes, but doesn\u2019t find anything.</p><p>\u201cOoh, his wallet!\u201d</p><p>I rush over to Monika as she opens his brown leather wallet. \u201cYou can\u2019t look in his wallet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>I grab it out of her hand. \u201cBecause that\u2019s, like, super personal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. What better way to find out about someone? Besides his phone, a boy\u2019s wallet is a window to his soul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I hear Derek\u2019s voice behind us. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard that before.\u201d</p><p>Oh, crap!</p><p>I whip around and wish I wasn\u2019t the one holding the evidence of us snooping. Derek eyes the wallet, then me. My heart skips a beat. I feel like a kid who just got caught with her hand in the cookie jar. I quickly toss the wallet on his bed and step back, as if that will somehow erase my involvement in this scheme.</p><p>\u201cHi, Derek,\u201d I manage to croak out. \u201cWe were just . . .\u201d I look to Monika for help.</p><p>Monika walks over to Derek with an innocent smile on her face. \u201cAshtyn and I were having a disagreement, and we had to come in your room to settle it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was the disagreement?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good question,\u201d I mutter under my breath.</p><p>\u201cYes, that is a good question,\u201d Monika agrees. Derek looks mighty amused right now as we struggle to come up with something that doesn\u2019t sound like the truth\u2014that we were snooping around his room to get intel on him. He doesn\u2019t look mad or nervous that we might have found out that he plays poker and is stashing a bunch of cash in his boot.</p><p>I might as well try to get us out of this. \u201cWe wanted to know if you . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarry a condom in your wallet!\u201d Monika points to his wallet. \u201cYes. That\u2019s it! Ashtyn bet that guys carry condoms in their wallets, and I said that\u2019s, like, something guys did in the \u201980s.\u201d</p><p>Condoms? Couldn\u2019t Monika come up with something less . . . embarrassing?</p><p>The side of his mouth quirks up. \u201cSo what\u2019s the verdict, ladies?\u201d</p><p>I glance at his wallet. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have a chance to find out, but that\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>Derek picks the wallet up and hands it to me. \u201cHere. Open it. You came all the way down here to find out, why stop now?\u201d</p><p>I clear my throat as I stare at it. Monika gestures for me to just get it over with. I clear my throat again, then unfold the thing and peek inside. There\u2019s a bunch of bills. I check the side pocket and slide out a picture of a pretty woman wearing a bright blue dress standing next to a guy in Navy whites. It must be his parents, because the woman has Derek\u2019s eyes and the man has Derek\u2019s chiseled bone structure. I check the other side pocket, which is empty.</p><p>\u201cNo condom,\u201d I say.</p><p>He takes the wallet from me. \u201cI guess you lose.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 19</p><p>Derek</p><p>A week after Ashtyn and Landon made up, she walks into the kitchen and tosses a FedEx envelope on the table. \u201cThis is addressed to you.\u201d She turns and opens the pantry.</p><p>A FedEx letter? At first a pang of dread settles inside me, thinking that it might be bad news about my dad. But bad news to families of military personnel doesn\u2019t come by FedEx. The time to panic is when a couple of guys in uniform show up on your doorstep.</p><p>I wince when I look at the return address. It\u2019s from my grandmother in Texas, my mom\u2019s mom. How the hell did she know where I was? She used to send the obligatory birthday gift, but I haven\u2019t personally heard from her in years.</p><p>My grandmother Elizabeth Worthington hated that my parents married. My dad wasn\u2019t from upper-crust Texas society like my mom. When they got married, my mom\u2019s parents cut her off. My grandmother didn\u2019t even come to my mom\u2019s funeral. Instead, she sent a truckload of flowers. What did she think, that flowers were bandages that would replace all the years lost? Fat chance of that.</p><p>I don\u2019t give a shit what Elizabeth Worthington has to say to me. I toss the unopened envelope in the trash.</p><p>\u201cWhat did it say?\u201d Ashtyn asks, turning around with a stack of cookies in her hand. Obviously she\u2019s clueless to the fact that I never opened the thing.</p><p>\u201cI thought we weren\u2019t supposed to pry into each other\u2019s business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just curious. Besides, you owe me one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>She opens her mouth wide in shock. \u201cCome on, Cowboy. You said you weren\u2019t going to interfere in my life, and all of a sudden you\u2019re fist-pumping my guy friends, playing stupid drinking games with my boyfriend, and flirting with my girlfriends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFlirting? With who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDuh. Bree.\u201d</p><p>I hold a hand up. \u201cListen, the girl asked if the gas and the oil go in the same hole in the mower or separate ones. Then she called and asked if I\u2019d go out with her Saturday night. What\u2019d you want me to do, ignore her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you really think she was interested in gas and oil, you\u2019re an idiot. She wants to get into your pants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with that?\u201d When she doesn\u2019t answer, I say, \u201cIf you must know what\u2019s in the FedEx envelope, it\u2019s a letter of acceptance from the US Olympic team,\u201d I lie.</p><p>Her eyebrows go up. \u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMen\u2019s synchronized trampolining.\u201d I brush imaginary dust off my shoulders. \u201cI don\u2019t like to brag, but I won gold at the national championships last year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as synchronized trampolining, Derek.\u201d</p><p>I pat the top of her head like she\u2019s a kid. \u201cYes, there is.\u201d</p><p>She rolls those sparkling, bright eyes that draw me in. I tell myself I like annoying the crap out of her, but the truth is that I like being around her when she\u2019s all riled up. \u201cYou\u2019re such a liar.\u201d</p><p>Ashtyn is wrong. What\u2019s worse is that she thinks she\u2019s not. \u201cWanna bet on it, Sugar Pie?\u201d</p><p>She puts her hands on her hips. \u201cYeah, I wanna bet on it. And then we\u2019ll go to the computer so I can prove it to you.\u201d</p><p>This is getting interesting. \u201cWhat\u2019s the bet, then?\u201d</p><p>She thinks for a minute, then rubs her hands together as if she\u2019s come up with the most brilliant idea. \u201cIf I win, you have to eat an entire bag of Skittles.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe purple ones, too?\u201d I laugh.

I don\u2019t think I heard you right because I thought you just said \u2018go out with you.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if I win,\u201d I clarify.</p><p>\u201cWhoa, like, on a date? Umm . . .

Soon she\u2019s back carrying her laptop and wearing a cocky grin. \u201cI\u2019ve got an entire bag of Skittles with your name on it in the pantry, Cowboy. Jumbo size,\u201d she adds.</p><p>My mouth curves in a mischevious grin. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve got an entire night planned. Just for you.\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t look the least bit worried as she searches \u201cOlympic synchronized trampoline.\u201d It doesn\u2019t take long for her expression to change and the cockiness to vanish. She leans forward with furrowed eyebrows while a huge grin forms on my face. Usually her every move is calculated, but not now. As she scans various websites that prove I\u2019m right, she sits back and wrinkles her cute little nose, defeated. \u201cIt\u2019s a real sport,\u201d she mumbles.</p><p>\u201cI told you. Next time you should trust me.\u201d</p><p>She focuses those gray eyes on me as she slumps in the chair. \u201cI don\u2019t trust anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sucks.\u201d</p> <p>She nods. \u201cSure does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, call me an optimist, but I for one believe trust can be earned. Maybe I\u2019ll surprise you and change your mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoubt it.\u201d</p><p>I give her a gentle chuck on the chin. \u201cAh, a challenge. I like those.\u201d</p><p>I leave Ashtyn to stew about going out with me and find Julian in his room, looking at a picture book about sandcastles. Julian points to a huge, detailed creation with moats and bridges. \u201cDaddy made a sandcastle with me the last time we were at the beach.\u201d He puts the book down. \u201cThat was before he went on the big submarine.\u201d</p><p>Daddy. That\u2019s what I used to call my dad when I was Julian\u2019s age. The kid never met his own father, so it shouldn\u2019t surprise me that he considers my dad his dad, too. But it does. It\u2019s like every time I turn around, I\u2019m reminded I\u2019m part of a new family and my old one is fading fast. I want to reject it all, but when I look at the kid . . . I don\u2019t know. I feel connected to him, like a big brother would.</p><p>I kneel next to my stepbrother and say, \u201cWell, how about you ask your mom if you can get into a bathing suit and you and I can go to the beach to build a sandcastle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d He tosses the book on his bed and pops up with a huge grin. \u201cYeah!\u201d</p> <p>At the beach, Julian gets all excited once we start digging in the sand. A couple of other kids watch us and start building their own creations nearby. Julian sits a little taller knowing he\u2019s got the biggest, best castle by far.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my big brother,\u201d he tells one of the kids who admires the impressive moat we created.</p><p>\u201cWant to help us?\u201d I ask the kid. \u201cWe could use a couple more hands.\u201d</p><p>Once that kid joins us, others crowd around. Soon we\u2019ve amassed a small army of mini soldiers who gaze up at me as if I\u2019m some kind of sandcastle god, and they\u2019re talking to Julian as if he\u2019s twelve instead of five. Our creation looks like an entire kingdom now, with multiple castles and moats and tunnels.</p><p>When I\u2019m ready to call it quits on the castle making, I race Julian into Lake Michigan to wash off the sand. I show him how to float, supporting his back. We splash and play until the little guy starts getting sunburned, so he climbs on my shoulders as I carry him back to shore.</p><p>He leans down and hugs my neck. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re my brother, Derek.\u201d</p><p>I glance up at his little face, looking at me as if I\u2019m his hero. \u201cI\u2019m glad, too.\u201d</p><p>The fact that Julian\u2019s own father abandoned him, and now my dad is away, makes me the only male in his life. I wish his grandfather took an interest in him, but I haven\u2019t seen Gus have an interest in anything except disappearing and being grumpy.</p><p>After we dry off and are ready to leave, Julian agrees to go grocery shopping with me. I stock up on yogurt and kale and fruits and vegetables I bet have never graced the Parker household before.</p><p>Back at home, the FedEx envelope from my grandmother has magically resurfaced from the trash. It\u2019s on my pillow. And it\u2019s open. Shit. Ashtyn had something to do with this, no doubt.</p><p>I find Ashtyn in the living room, intently watching some reality show while munching on potato chips. Her hair is in a braid again and she\u2019s wearing cutoff sweats and a T-shirt with the words FREMONT ATHLETICS on it.</p><p>I wave the envelope in front of her face. \u201cWhy did you take this out of the trash?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you lie about it? It\u2019s not an invitation to be on the synchronized trampoline team.\u201d She tosses a chip to Falkor and sits up. \u201cIt\u2019s from your grandmother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t even read it, Derek.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s your business because . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not my business,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s yours, so read it.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t want to know what\u2019s in the letter. It\u2019s in the category of things I don\u2019t care about. \u201cAre you aware it\u2019s illegal to open someone else\u2019s mail? Does violation of privacy mean anythin\u2019 to you?\u201d</p><p>Ashtyn doesn\u2019t look guilty at all as she pulls another chip from the bag and pops it into her mouth. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t yours anymore. You threw it out. Legally speaking, it\u2019s not a violation of privacy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you, a lawyer now? How about the next time you get a letter I open it? That cool with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I toss it out, it\u2019s fair game. You\u2019re more than welcome to have at it.\u201d She points at the envelope in my hand with her greasy fingers. \u201cYou need to read that letter, Derek. It\u2019s important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I want your advice, I\u2019ll ask for it. In the meantime, stay out of my personal stuff.\u201d I walk in the kitchen and toss the letter in the garbage for a second time, then take out a blender.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you and Auntie Ashtyn fighting again?\u201d Julian asks as he walks in and watches as I pull stuff from the fridge.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not fightin\u2019. We\u2019re arguin\u2019. Want a snack?\u201d</p><p>He nods. \u201cDid you know it takes more muscles to frown than smile?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least I\u2019m giving my face muscles a workout.\u201d I make Julian a banana yogurt and spinach smoothie in the blender, then hand him a tall glass. \u201cHere you go. Enjoy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s green.\u201d He stares at the liquid as if it\u2019s poison. \u201cI . . . I don\u2019t like green drinks.\u201d</p><p>My mom would get up every Sunday morning and make us both smoothies. We had a ritual of clinking our glasses together before downing them. \u201cTry it.\u201d I pour a glass for myself and hold up my glass. \u201cCheers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDerek, no kid wants to drink that healthy crap.\u201d Ashtyn pulls out a box of cookies and a bag of marshmallows from the pantry. \u201cJulian, I\u2019ll make you something that doesn\u2019t look like liquid grass.\u201d</p><p>I watch as she excitedly makes little cookie sandwiches with marshmallows and nukes them in the microwave.</p><p>\u201cYou have to be careful not to cook them too long,\u201d she says. She peeks into the little microwave window that\u2019s probably nuking her brain cells along with her cookie sandwiches. \u201cOtherwise you\u2019ll burn the marshmallows.\u201d</p><p>She takes the plate out and displays it for Julian, proud of her creation. Julian looks at the cookie sandwiches, then the smoothie, then at me, and finally Ashtyn. Julian is the final judge of our little competition.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll just have string cheese.\u201d Julian pulls some out of the fridge and waves it at us as he walks out. \u201cBye!\u201d</p><p>Ashtyn makes a big deal out of eating her rejected sandwiches while I attempt to ignore her blissful moaning as she takes bite after bite. Those moans make me think about things I have no right thinking about. When she\u2019s done, she pulls the FedEx letter out of the trash again.</p><p>\u201cJust let it go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She holds it out to me and practically shoves it in my hand. \u201cRead it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause your grandmother is sick and wants to see you. I think she\u2019s dying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give a shit.\u201d At least I don\u2019t want to give a shit. I put down my glass and stare at the envelope.</p><p>\u201cCome on. You\u2019re not that heartless. Take something in life seriously besides those gross smoothies of yours.\u201d</p><p>She leaves the tattered envelope on the counter. It belongs in the garbage. Oh, hell. If she hadn\u2019t taken it out and read it, I could pretend it didn\u2019t exist. I wouldn\u2019t know my grandmother is dying. Not that I should care. I don\u2019t even know the woman. She wasn\u2019t there for my mom, even when she got sick and needed her. Why should I be there for her? The simple answer is, I won\u2019t.</p><p>I grab the envelope and toss it back in the trash.</p><p>Later in the evening, Julian runs outside when he sees fireflies in the front yard. I bring a glass jar I found in the kitchen so he can catch them.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you always fight with Auntie Ashtyn?\u201d he asks as he waits for the fireflies\u2019 butts to light up.</p><p>Leave it to the little kid to mention it again. \u201cIt\u2019s entertainin\u2019, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mom says that sometimes girls fight with boys because they like them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, your aunt Ashtyn doesn\u2019t like me very much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you like her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I like her. She\u2019s your mom\u2019s sister.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t look convinced. \u201cIf she wasn\u2019t my mom\u2019s sister, would you still like her?\u201d</p><p>I decide to put it in little kid terms, so he\u2019ll understand. \u201cJulian, sometimes girls are like junk food. They look good, and they sure taste good . . . but you know they\u2019re not healthy for you and cause cavities, so it\u2019s better to just leave \u2019em alone. Got me?\u201d</p><p>He looks up at me with big, bright eyes. \u201cSo Auntie Ashtyn is like Skittles?\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cYep. One big, jumbo bag of \u2019em.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate going to the dentist,\u201d he says, then goes back to catching the bugs. After putting them in the jar, Julian sits on the grass and studies them. He keeps intense focus on the random flickering lights. \u201cI wanna let them out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea.\u201d</p><p>He unscrews the top and empties the entire jar. \u201cNow you\u2019re free,\u201d he tells the bugs in an enthusiastic voice that resembles his mom\u2019s.</p><p>I hear the screen door open. Ashtyn walks toward us, her eyes outlined and shadowed with smoky, dark makeup. Her lips glisten with shiny lipstick. She\u2019s changed into a tight pink sundress that shows off her tan and toned curves. The way she looks could get her in trouble if the wrong guy took one look at her. Which is the real Ashtyn, the one who wears the black hoodies and T-shirts, or the one who wears the low-cut, tight clothes meant to turn guys on? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat are you guys doing?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cCatchin\u2019 fireflies,\u201d Julian responds, doing a pretty decent imitation of my Texas drawl.</p><p>\u201cCan I help?\u201d</p><p>I hold up the empty jar. \u201cYou\u2019re too late. We\u2019re done.\u201d Her faint smile fades. \u201cSorry \u2019bout that.\u201d</p> <p>Julian touches a charm on her bracelet. \u201cCool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy boyfriend bought this for me,\u201d she tells him.</p><p>Her boyfriend drives up in his Vette, which explains the sexy dress.</p><p>Landon gets out of his car and pulls Ashtyn close after admiring her outfit. They kiss, but I\u2019ve seen more passion when Falkor licks his nuts.</p><p>Chapter 20</p> <p>Ashtyn</p><p>Landon takes me to dinner at a Japanese steak house. We share a table with six other people who are there to celebrate one of their birthdays. They\u2019re a rowdy group and completely wasted.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you Carter McKnight\u2019s kid?\u201d one of the men asks.</p><p>Landon puffs out his chest. \u201cSure am.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly Landon is the center of attention. He ends up talking to them about football the entire two-hour meal. They question him about the upcoming season and ask if Landon is going to follow in his father\u2019s footsteps. He nods and says, \u201cMy plan is to have a bigger career than my dad had.\u201d His statement is met with praise from the group, as if they\u2019re seeing a pro in the making. He doesn\u2019t mention that I play, too. It\u2019s all been about him tonight.</p><p>As the waitress clears our plates, Landon excuses himself to go to the bathroom. \u201cBe right back.\u201d</p> <p>A minute later his phone vibrates. He\u2019d left his cell on the table, so I glance at the screen. It\u2019s Lily again . . . but this time she texts a picture of herself standing in front of a mirror wearing nothing but panties. She shields her breasts with one arm, her cell obviously in her other hand as she smiles into the camera. I look away, telling myself I\u2019m not jealous of her flawless olive skin, her shiny, long black hair, or her dark, exotic eyes. I want to think she\u2019s ugly, but she\u2019s not.</p><p>Remember this? her text reads.</p><p>When Landon gets back to the table, I hand him his cell. \u201cYou got a text.\u201d</p><p>He glances at his phone, then slowly sits down. \u201cIt\u2019s not what you think, Ash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s a naked picture of your ex-girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>The other people at the table are listening to our conversation. Landon is starting to squirm. \u201cCan we talk about this later?\u201d he murmurs through clenched teeth.</p><p>I don\u2019t care if he\u2019s embarrassed. \u201cTake me home,\u201d I demand after we pay the bill. I don\u2019t wait for an answer; I head for the door.</p><p>\u201cLet me explain,\u201d he says once we\u2019re in his car.</p> <p>\u201cHave at it. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a perfectly logical reason why Lily is sending you naked pictures of herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not my fault. She wants to get back together, I guess.\u201d When he senses I\u2019m not satisfied with his explanation, he sighs in frustration. \u201cYou know I hate the girl drama jealousy thing, Ash. There\u2019s nothing going on between me and Lily. I love you. Trust me.\u201d He avoids my gaze as he starts the car.</p><p>I remember my conversation with Derek. A guy is bullshittin\u2019 you when he doesn\u2019t look you in the eye. That he might be right only makes me angrier.</p><p>I\u2019m so busy fuming that I don\u2019t realize Landon isn\u2019t driving me home until we pull up in front of Club Mystique. On the border between Fremont and Fairfield, it\u2019s our suburb\u2019s most popular club that allows entry if you\u2019re seventeen and older. Landon loves it here.</p><p>\u201cLandon, I\u2019m not in the mood to dance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to dance, don\u2019t dance,\u201d he says, putting his hand on my knee. \u201cWe\u2019ll go to the VIP section and just chill. I\u2019ll prove to you that you\u2019re my one and only. Cool?\u201d</p><p>I nod reluctantly. \u201cCool.\u201d</p><p>He squeezes my knee. \u201cThat\u2019s my girl. Trust me.\u201d</p><p>He parks out front and hands the valet his keys and a twenty-dollar tip. It\u2019s Monday night, but the place is packed because supposedly some famous DJ from LA is spinning. And it\u2019s summer, when college and high school students treat every day like it\u2019s a weekend.</p><p>Landon\u2019s arm is wrapped around me as we bypass the line and walk to the door designated for VIPs. The bouncer immediately recognizes Landon and waves us through. Most kids have to show an ID to prove they\u2019re at least seventeen. Not Landon.</p><p>I feel the floor vibrate with the beat of the music. The place is so crowded it\u2019s hard to move. It\u2019s dark except for the flashing lights on the dance floor. Landon takes my hand and leads me up the stairs to the roped-off VIP section, where anybody with either money or status is assured a seat and alcohol. We end up sitting on a red velvet couch overlooking the dance area. When a waitress comes by in a skimpy thong bikini with white ruffles to ask if he wants a shot, without checking for an \u201cover 21\u201d mark on his hand, Landon opens a tab and seems all too happy to be served by her. She lifts a bottle of tequila above his head and he tilts his head back, waiting for her to pour the shot straight into his waiting mouth. He shakes his head and quickly downs the liquid.</p><p>\u201cWant to try one?\u201d he asks me as he swipes the back of his hand across his mouth.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He slips the girl a twenty, an overly generous tip. She gives him a big thanks with a practiced wink and a smile. He eyes her butt as she heads off to serve other customers.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you, Landon?\u201d He\u2019s showing off. This isn\u2019t the Landon I know, the Landon I fell for and have been dating for months.</p><p>\u201cNothing. Loosen up for once, Ash. See, even Derek knows how to have a good time.\u201d He points below, where lights are flashing and the dance floor is packed.</p><p>I scan the crowd and see Derek dancing with Bree. She\u2019s got her back to him, grinding against him. Monika and Trey are dancing next to them. They\u2019re all smiling and laughing. I can\u2019t help but feel left out and annoyed. I don\u2019t own Derek and stake no claim to him, but for some stupid reason it\u2019s hard to watch him with someone else. To top off my annoyance, Derek is a great dancer and isn\u2019t afraid to tear it up on the dance floor. I would\u2019ve thought if he knew any kind of dancing it\u2019d be line dancing to country music. I never expected him to be impressive in a club with house music.</p><p>Since when do my best friend and her boyfriend double-date with Derek and Bree? I just wish they hadn\u2019t gone to the same place as us tonight. Seeing Derek here stirs something in me that I don\u2019t want to feel.</p><p>Bree turns and wraps her arms around Derek\u2019s neck. His hands are now on her waist as they move together to the music. I just want to leave so I don\u2019t have to watch them. When the song ends, he glances up. I look away so he doesn\u2019t catch me staring and somehow realize that I can get lost in those eyes of his that give a glimpse into his soul.</p><p>Landon moves closer and licks my neck. \u201cYou smell good, Ash,\u201d he whispers in my ear before sucking on my lobe and resting his hand on my inner thigh. \u201cAnd you look sexy as hell.\u201d Normally I don\u2019t mind when Landon tries to turn me on, but I\u2019m used to it being in private. This seems like a big show and completely unemotional.</p><p>\u201cI have to go to the bathroom. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d I grab my purse and head for the nearest restroom. I lock myself in one of the stalls and lean my head against the door as I try to force my confused emotions into order.</p><p>Seeing Derek with Bree ripped open a wound I never knew existed. I bang the back of my head against the stall door in frustration. This can\u2019t be happening. Not now, when everything was starting to fall back into place. I\u2019m captain of the football team. My sister and nephew are back home, at least for the moment.</p><p>Derek is ruining everything, because the reality of it all hits me like an oncoming lineman in a blitz. Not only did Derek invade my house and my friends and my life . . . he\u2019s wormed his way into my heart.</p><p>I have a crush on Derek that\u2019s not about to go away anytime soon. And I have to break up with Landon.</p><p>My life is a complete mess.</p><p>I walk back to Landon and am shocked to see him talking to Matthew Bonk as if they\u2019re old buddies. It\u2019s like I\u2019m in another dimension. Bonk and Landon hate each other. They\u2019re rivals on and off the field, so why are they smiling and giving each other high fives? Wouldn\u2019t Bonk be furious that Landon was behind posting those humiliating pictures online?</p><p>\u201cCatch you later, man.\u201d Bonk gives Landon a pat on the back like they\u2019re teammates. The guy gives me a private, evil laugh as he passes me, reminding me of a predator about to strike.</p><p>\u201cWhy were you talking to Bonk?\u201d I ask Landon. I have an uneasy feeling in the pit of my stomach. Landon and Bonk are from rival teams. Fairfield plays dirty on and off the field. Landon knows this. He also knows that Bonk instigates things. I don\u2019t trust him at all. Nobody on my team does.</p><p>\u201cSit down, Ashtyn,\u201d Landon orders.</p><p>I shake my head and step back when he reaches for my wrist. \u201cNot until you explain why you and Bonk are suddenly acting like besties.\u201d</p><p>He reaches out again and catches my elbow this time, wrapping his fingers around my arm and forcing me to sit next to him. \u201cDon\u2019t cause a scene.\u201d</p><p>I try to wrest free, but his grip is like a vise. He\u2019s never been like this. It\u2019s scaring me. I wince when his fingers dig into my skin.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m dropping out of Fremont and transferring to Fairfield. Since I live on the borderline between the two districts, I had my pick of schools. So when they offered me their captain position, I took it,\u201d he admits.</p><p>The pain in my arm is nothing compared to the betrayal crashing down on me. \u201cYou\u2019re quitting?\u201d Suddenly it all sinks in. \u201cYou missed practice because you were being recruited by Fairfield, not because your parents had you busy with family stuff.\u201d I narrow my eyes. \u201cYou lied!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t lie. I took what was offered.\u201d He acts like it\u2019s no big deal to change teams. \u201cIf Fremont wants you as their captain, that\u2019s cool.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m trying to breathe normally even though I\u2019m getting dizzy from shock. \u201cIf you leave, all we have is Brandon Butter. There\u2019s no way we\u2019ll make it to State.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, I gotta do what\u2019s good for me, not what\u2019s going to please everyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy take me out tonight? Why make me think everything is cool between us when all along you were going to ditch me and your teammates? You told me you loved me. Was that a lie, too?\u201d</p><p>He shrugs.</p><p>Chapter 21</p><p>Derek</p><p>I try to focus on Bree so I don\u2019t look at the balcony where Landon is all over Ashtyn. This inner battle to leave her alone is being lost, because I\u2019d like nothing better than to switch places with the guy.</p><p>The night was going just fine until Ashtyn showed up with her boyfriend.</p><p>Bree rubs against me again as if I\u2019m her personal stripper pole. She\u2019s a good dancer. When Bree asked me to come out with her and Monika and Trey, I thought it would be a relief to have one night without Ashtyn acting like I\u2019m ruining her life. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Hell, in reality it\u2019s the other way around. I glance up at the balcony, unable to stop myself. I expect to see Ashtyn snuggled up all cozy with Landon on that red couch.</p><p>But Ashtyn doesn\u2019t look happy to be sitting next to her boyfriend. Landon\u2019s got his fingers tightly wrapped around Ashtyn\u2019s arm. It looks like she\u2019s trying to pull away, but he\u2019s got a solid hold and won\u2019t release her. She looks alarmed and upset and . . . she winces in pain.</p><p>Fuck!</p><p>With rage firing an adrenaline rush, I shove through the crowd and rush to the stairs. There\u2019s no way I\u2019m about to let him hurt her on my watch. I don\u2019t give a shit if she wants me to stay out of her business.</p> <p>I eye the big bouncer blocking the roped-off VIP section leading to the second story. \u201cTwo chicks are fightin\u2019 over there.\u201d I point to the center of the room. \u201cYou better get there quick, \u2019cause I think one of \u2019em is gettin\u2019 her dress ripped off her.\u201d</p><p>The bouncer abandons his post. I jump the VIP rope. As I take the stairs two at a time, I see Ashtyn rake her nails clear down her boyfriend\u2019s cheek.</p><p>Landon drops her arm as he touches his face and realizes she\u2019s cut him. She stands proud and tall, eyeing him in disgust. His gaze darts left and right, taking notice of everyone staring. He\u2019s pissed now and has his hand raised as if he\u2019s about to hit her.</p><p>I rush toward Ashtyn and plant myself between her and Landon before he has a chance to touch her. \u201cLay a hand on her and I\u2019ll kick the everlovin\u2019 shit out of you,\u201d I say with a vengeance, my hands in fists at my sides ready to fight.</p><p>\u201cYou want a piece of me?\u201d Landon challenges, shoving me. He looks me up and down as if I\u2019m insignificant.</p> <p>I shove back. \u201cMan, I\u2019ve wanted a piece of you since I first met you,\u201d I say. This is the point of no return. McKnight isn\u2019t about to back down, and there\u2019s no way in hell I\u2019m letting him get away with hurting Ashtyn.</p><p>\u201cGet your hands off me!\u201d Ashtyn screams from behind me. Her frantic voice jerks my attention to her.</p><p>Panic jolts through me as I see her being held by one of Bonk\u2019s friends. She\u2019s trying to claw and kick her way out of his grip, but the dude is twice her size.</p><p>When my head is turned, McKnight lands a solid right hook to my jaw. Shit, that hurt. I lost focus and made myself vulnerable. If there\u2019s one thing I learned fighting in Regents\u2019 boxing club, it\u2019s never take your eyes off your opponent.</p><p>Time to get back in the game.</p><p>I punch Landon and make sure he\u2019s on the floor before I glance back at Ashtyn. Bonk is barreling toward me with fury written all over his face and five guys backing him. I lunge for the guy holding Ashtyn, but Bonk and his posse cut me off.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s the guy who took the picture,\u201d Bonk announces to his friends. He aims a punch at me, but I\u2019m too fast and dodge his fist.</p><p>I land a solid one to his side, but his friends pull me away. They restrain me while I struggle and Bonk pummels me. I fight to get loose, but there\u2019s like six guys holding me. I can\u2019t get free. Bonk is having a field day. I taste my own blood from my busted lip, and even though I get a good kick in and Bonk flies backward, it doesn\u2019t matter because another one of his friends is right there to pick up where he left off.</p><p>I know how to dodge punches, but not with four guys holding me back. I\u2019m breathing hard and starting to get dizzy. Then Trey and a bunch of guys on the Fremont football team join the fight. They rip the guys off me and start pummeling their rivals. The entire balcony is in chaos, with fists flying and security trying to break it up.</p><p>I scan the crowd desperately for Ashtyn. She\u2019s managed to break free of the guy who\u2019d been holding her, so I get between her and the fighting and lead her to an alcove. \u201cStay here,\u201d I tell her, then turn to help Trey and the guys.</p><p>I should know better than to trust that Ashtyn will listen to me, because I see her clutch at Bonk\u2019s arm as he\u2019s about to fight Victor. I grab Bonk and pull him back, hoping that Ashtyn will be scared enough to go back to the alcove.</p><p>\u201cAre you ever gonna listen to me?\u201d I ask her.</p><p>She shakes her head and says simply, \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 22</p> <p>Ashtyn</p><p>I\u2019m devastated. And shocked. And mad and hurt. But I\u2019m not some diva who needs to be rescued by Derek. I\u2019m about to jump onto the back of a Fairfield player when someone comes up behind me and throws me to the ground.</p><p>Before I can get up, Derek is there to pull me to my feet. His mouth is a bloody mess and his face is bruised. \u201cShit, Ashtyn. Why didn\u2019t you hide off to the side where you\u2019d be safe?\u201d</p><p>By now huge bouncers are flocking up the stairs.</p><p>\u201cLeave me alone.\u201d I shove him away.</p><p>\u201cLike hell I will. I\u2019m gettin\u2019 you out of here.\u201d He slings me over his shoulder and muscles through the crowd.</p><p>\u201cLet me go, you jerk,\u201d I say, attempting to squirm out of his grasp. \u201cI don\u2019t need your help.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t answer. Instead, he takes me outside and puts me down in front of his car. \u201cGet in the car. Now.\u201d I open my mouth to protest, but he puts a hand up. \u201cDon\u2019t argue with me.\u201d</p><p>I sit in the car stewing about everything that happened, while Derek goes to talk to the guys just now coming out of the club. Vic looks all too happy that he arrived just in time for the brawl. Bree\u2019s fingers gently trail down Derek\u2019s bruised face as her perfectly shaped eyebrows furrow with compassion.</p><p>\u201cBree, you\u2019re laying it on thick,\u201d I mumble to myself.</p><p>Trey and Monika leave in Trey\u2019s car while Derek opens the backseat for his date.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Bree slides in the car. \u201cOh, my God, Ashtyn! Can you believe what just happened? Those guys from Fairfield are just awful. I feel so sorry for Derek. I mean, did you see how many of those Fairfield guys it took to hold him down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t counting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was four, or maybe five!\u201d</p><p>Derek is in the car now. He\u2019s holding his side and moving slowly.</p><p>\u201cYou okay to drive?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure? Because your face looks like a piece of raw meat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d He pulls out of the parking lot as if the fight never happened and he doesn\u2019t have bloodstains on his clothes or a busted-up lip. I watch as Bree reaches through the headrest and caresses Derek\u2019s shoulders, occasionally slipping her fingers under his collar in a not-so-subtle flirty way. When he glances at me, I pretend to look at something super interesting out the window.</p><p>It isn\u2019t long before he pulls into Bree\u2019s driveway and he\u2019s walking her to her front door.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t kiss her,\u201d I mumble. \u201cYour mouth is bleeding, and it\u2019s unsanitary and gross.\u201d And I don\u2019t want you to like her. Please don\u2019t kiss her. And don\u2019t have any physical contact with her, either. Just walk away. Walk. Away. Like now would be a great time.</p><p>I want to avert my eyes from the two silhouettes, but I can\u2019t. Bree is an experienced flirter and isn\u2019t subtle. She\u2019s a girl who\u2019s used to getting whatever guy she wants. She has the perfect body, perfect face, perfect hair. She\u2019s feminine, is a cheerleader, and laughs a lot. Bree wraps her arms around Derek\u2019s neck and he pulls her in for a short hug. Then he must\u2019ve said something funny, because she laughs and puts her hand on his chest. Does she have to touch him every two seconds?</p><p>I\u2019m tempted to honk the horn, but it\u2019s late and I\u2019m not sure Bree\u2019s neighbors will be happy if I wake them up. Finally Bree walks in her house and Derek comes back to the car.</p><p>\u201cTook you long enough,\u201d I say in a huff as he slowly slides in the driver\u2019s seat, wincing in pain.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kiddin\u2019 me, right?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t answer, because my feelings are as raw as his face. I\u2019m aware I\u2019m acting immature and irrational. Truth is, I don\u2019t want him to be with Bree. I\u2019m jealous and vulnerable and dealing with Landon\u2019s betrayal and the knowledge that I\u2019ve got feelings for Derek and he\u2019s probably got the hots for Bree.</p><p>\u201cBree\u2019s really pretty,\u201d I mumble.</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you like her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s cool.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t get it.</p><p>When he pulls into our driveway, I want to tell him what I\u2019m feeling. The problem is I have no clue what to say\u2014my mind is a jumble of emotions that don\u2019t make sense. He\u2019d probably laugh at me and run in the opposite direction if I told him I didn\u2019t want him going out with Bree.</p><p>I open my mouth to express something more than animosity toward him, but all that comes out is, \u201cI could\u2019ve handled Landon myself.\u201d</p><p>He swipes his bloody mouth with the back of his hand. \u201cYou keep tellin\u2019 yourself that and you might actually start believin\u2019 it.\u201d</p><p>Ashtyn, tell him you\u2019re developing feelings for him. Tell Derek that seeing him beat up scares you. Tell him you want to hold him. Tell him that you need him.</p><p>I slowly step out of the car and ignore all the inner voices telling me what to do. Because expressing any or all of those things will make me vulnerable, will set me up to be emotionally wounded once again.</p><p>I\u2019m almost at the door when Derek says, \u201cAshtyn, wait.\u201d</p><p>I keep my back to him, but hear gravel crunch beneath his shoes as he steps closer. It\u2019s dark, except for the small yellow light on our front porch giving off a soft glow.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a girl, you know,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd you can\u2019t fight all your battles alone. You might be a football player, but you can\u2019t fend off a two-hundred-pound linebacker.\u201d He urges me to turn around, then glances at the nasty red marks on my arm from Landon\u2019s tight grip. \u201cOr your boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not my boyfriend anymore.\u201d Landon lied to me. And manipulated me. And he\u2019s transferring to Fairfield in the fall. It\u2019s over. We\u2019re completely screwed. I don\u2019t know . . . maybe I can convince him to come back if I give him the captain spot. Our division is tough. We need a good quarterback to get any attention from scouts. I rub my eyes and wish someone would tell me everything will be okay. But it won\u2019t.</p><p>Derek lets out a slow breath as my words sink in. \u201cYou broke up?\u201d</p><p>I nod.</p><p>We\u2019re standing a few feet away from each other. It would be so easy to close the distance between us, but neither of us is moving. I have the urge to reach up and lightly touch the side of his cut, bruised face. For a moment, I feel his pain as if it were my own. But no matter what\u2019s going on beneath the surface, I have to remember that Derek and I are never going to happen. He\u2019s the guy who\u2019ll love you, then leave you without a backward glance. I can\u2019t do that . . . it could destroy the thin thread of hope that I can have feelings for someone who won\u2019t turn their back on me and leave. I\u2019m dealing with more than enough betrayal tonight. I don\u2019t need to add to it.</p><p>Derek walks inside the house and heads to his bedroom. I prepare a washcloth, raid our medicine cabinet, and find an ice pack in the freezer. I find Derek sitting on his bed looking at his cell phone. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He glances up at me. \u201cIf you came here to mess around, I\u2019m not really in great shape, but if you want to do all the work while I sit back I\u2019m game\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPut that ego to rest. I only came to help disinfect those wounds. Shut up or I\u2019m out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d he says, then moves to the center of the bed to give me room. I\u2019m surprised he tosses his ever-present phone aside.</p><p>I kneel on the bed and gently swipe the washcloth over his cut eyebrow. I\u2019m too aware of the fact that we\u2019re on the same bed and if things were different . . .</p> <p>No. I can\u2019t let my mind wander to the \u201cwhat if\u201d because reality is what it is. Derek has made it clear that fooling around is a game to him. I don\u2019t play those kind of games.</p><p>How can I hide the fact that I have a crush on him when I have a major case of nerves right now? I\u2019m trying to stop my hand from shaking, but there\u2019s still a slight tremor in my fingertips. The only time I get this jittery is during a game where whether we win or lose depends on me making a field goal. Normally I shrug the feeling off and focus on the task at hand.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you doin\u2019 this?\u201d Derek asks, his deep voice sending electricity through my veins.</p><p>If I look into his mesmerizing clear blue eyes, will he immediately know what I\u2019m feeling? He\u2019d laugh at me if he could read my mind and my body. I avoid eye contact and instead concentrate on wiping dried blood off his lip now.</p><p>\u201cBecause I don\u2019t want to see you get an infection,\u201d I say. \u201cDon\u2019t flatter yourself, Cowboy. This is for my benefit more than yours.\u201d</p> <p>I wash away the blood, careful not to make him wince in pain. I\u2019d never tend to a wound with the guys on my team. When one of us gets hurt or cut up, we either take care of it ourselves or let one of the trainers do it. Right here, right now, my female instincts to protect and heal have kicked in. When all the dried blood is off, I dab some antibacterial ointment on his wounds. It feels too personal and intimate.</p><p>\u201cYour hands are shakin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, they\u2019re not,\u201d I lie as I dab the ointment on his warm, smooth skin. \u201cI\u2019m annoyed and tired and pissed off.\u201d And frustrated with myself for wanting Derek to pull me close and hold me all night. Fantasies are never as good as reality.</p><p>I sit back on my heels and regard my work. I\u2019m suddenly tired and feeling emotionally and physically weak. If Derek reached out for me, I\u2019d snuggle into his chest. Right now if he asked me how I felt, I\u2019d be tempted to tell him.</p><p>He leans back on the bed and holds his breath, an indication that his face isn\u2019t the only thing bruised. \u201cThanks, Ashtyn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not done. Take your shirt off and I\u2019ll check your ribs.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf I get undressed, you\u2019re gonna want to do more than check my ribs.\u201d</p><p>Acting like I don\u2019t care has become the new normal for me. I point to my stoic expression. \u201cThis is my \u2018not impressed\u2019 look.\u201d</p><p>The side of his mouth quirks up as he lifts his shirt over his head and tosses it aside. He flexes his pecs.</p><p>I yawn in response, refusing to show any sign of admiration. I zone in on the red marks that are starting to form on his side and ribs. It\u2019s going to take more than a few days for him to heal.</p><p>\u201cWant me to take my pants off, too?\u201d he jokes as he wags his brows suggestively. \u201cI might have some swelling down there.\u201d</p><p>Everything is a game to him. I look him right in the eye as I slip a finger under the waistband of his pants and shove the ice pack underneath. \u201cThere,\u201d I say as I get up to leave. \u201cThat should help.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 23</p><p>Derek</p> <p>\u201cWhat the hell happened to you?\u201d Gus barks when I pass him on my way to the bathroom in the morning.</p><p>\u201cI got in a fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need a delinquent or troublemaker in my house. Brandi!\u201d he yells, his gravelly voice bouncing off the walls of the house.</p><p>Brandi has a big muffin in her hand as she walks out of the kitchen. \u201cYeah, Dad?\u201d</p><p>Gus throws his hands up. \u201cYour stepson got himself in a fight. Look at him, all beat up and looking like a thug.\u201d</p><p>The Parkers sure like to use that word.</p><p>One look at my face and Brandi sucks in a breath. \u201cOh, my God! Derek, what happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothin\u2019,\u201d I say. \u201cI just got in a fight, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what? With who? Were the police called? How did you drive home like that?\u201d Brandi asks, bombarding me with questions when all I want to do is take a piss and a painkiller.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, it\u2019s not a big deal to you,\u201d Gus argues, \u201cbecause I\u2019ll be the one having to foot the bill if whoever you fought decides to press charges and sue you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSue me?\u201d That\u2019s a joke, considering I\u2019m the one who got my ass kicked. You\u2019d think he\u2019d ask if I\u2019m the one who wants to press charges. \u201cYou won\u2019t have to foot any bill, Gus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you think.\u201d</p><p>I think the guy just wants to be miserable. I don\u2019t want to get caught up in the Parker family drama. If I did, I\u2019d tell Gus he should be more concerned about his family than whether or not he\u2019ll be sued for a fight.</p><p>In the bathroom, I look in the mirror. Damn. Ashtyn was right. I look like a piece of meat that\u2019s been through the grinder one too many times. Dried blood is on my lip, my cheek is black and blue, and the side of my rib is bruised.</p><p>Ashtyn came in my room last night to nurse my wounds. She had no clue I was tempted to mess around with her in an attempt to make me forget the searing pain in my body. Just the thought of it made my body excited. The girl has power over me. When she looks at me, I feel like a fucking virgin again. Not that she looks at me often. She avoids eye contact most of the time. The sight of me obviously makes her sick. She practically told me as much last night.</p><p>She said she wasn\u2019t impressed. I made fun of her comment and pretended to mock her, but in reality I wanted her to admit that she had a reaction to being so close to me. Hell, I had a reaction. Little did she know I actually needed that ice pack in my shorts.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doin\u2019?\u201d I ask myself.</p><p>I\u2019m not supposed to get caught up in someone else\u2019s messy life. I\u2019ve got my own to deal with. Up until now I\u2019ve gotten along just fine, cruising through without getting too involved or too interested in anyone else.</p><p>Ashtyn Parker is dangerous. She\u2019s got this tough exterior, talks like a guy, and dresses like one half the time. Then there\u2019s the other half, the half that\u2019s vulnerable and insecure and wears sexy clothes to make sure people know she\u2019s all woman underneath that harsh facade. I thought I was pushing her buttons in an attempt to push her away. But maybe it\u2019s to break down that wall she\u2019s got up.</p><p>This morning I saw her leave the house. Her head was down as she took Falkor for a walk. Ugh, if she keeps moping around, I\u2019m gonna be annoyed. Is she pining after that dick of a boyfriend? She said they broke up. I\u2019ll bet the guy comes back and tries to lure her into his life again.</p><p>\u201cDerek, are you in there?\u201d Julian\u2019s voice echoes from the other side of the door.</p><p>I open the door and let the little guy in. His eyes go wide and his jaw drops when he takes one look at my face. He steps back in fear.</p><p>\u201cIt looks worse than it is,\u201d I tell him. \u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you get in a fight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you lost.\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cLooks that way, huh?\u201d</p><p>He nods. \u201cYou look tough with bruises on your face. Did Daddy teach you how to fight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you teach me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBuddy, you don\u2019t want to learn to fight. Just use your words like your mama says.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what if someone hits me first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell a teacher or your mama.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen all the kids will call me a tattletale and I\u2019ll have no friends.\u201d He puts his hands on his hips. \u201cYou don\u2019t want me to be a friendless tattletaler, do you?\u201d</p><p>The kid should be a lawyer, because he\u2019s already got negotiating skills. Just to ease his curiosity, I kneel down and hold my palms up. \u201cAll right, show me what you got.\u201d</p><p>The little guy puts his fists up and strikes my palm. \u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot bad,\u201d I say. \u201cAgain.\u201d</p><p>He does it a few more times. I can tell his confidence is building because his punches are getting harder and he\u2019s starting to loosen up. \u201cI was watching professional wrestling on TV when my mom wasn\u2019t in the room,\u201d he says. \u201cRandy the Raider gave this guy the F.U. move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe F.U. move?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing, Derek?\u201d Brandi asks, suddenly appearing behind Julian. \u201cAre you teaching my son how to fight and use profanity?\u201d</p><p>Umm . . .</p><p>Julian turns around excitedly. \u201cMom, Derek was just showing me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJulian, go to your room. I need to talk to Derek alone.\u201d Julian is about to protest, but Brandi urges him out of the bathroom. When he\u2019s out of sight, Brandi pushes back her long hair. \u201cJulian was excited when I told him you were coming to live with us. He calls you his big brother and looks up to you.\u201d She sighs slowly, a clue that a well-thought-out revelation will come out of her mouth next. Wait for it . . . wait for it . . . \u201cI thought of making you and Julian real brothers.\u201d</p><p>What is she talking about? Does she expect us to do a ritual thing like cut ourselves and rub blood together so we\u2019re blood brothers? \u201cBrandi, I hate to break the news to you, but no matter what, Julian and I didn\u2019t come from the same mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She tilts her head to the side. \u201cBut I thought it would be nice if I, you know, made it official by adopting you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not an orphan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I just thought you and Julian . . . you know, if something happens to me and your father . . .\u201d</p><p>I get it. She doesn\u2019t want to be my mother any more than I want her to be mine. It\u2019s all for Julian\u2019s sake. Time to put her wayward thoughts to rest. \u201cJulian\u2019s my little brother, Brandi. Period.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. We need to be on the same page. And regarding you and my sister . . .\u201d</p><p>Oh, man. Maybe Brandi\u2019s more with it than I give her credit for. That\u2019s not good. \u201cNothin\u2019s goin\u2019 on between us,\u201d I tell her. \u201cYour sister drives me insane. I could never date a girl like her even if we\u2014\u201d</p><p>Brandi suddenly bursts into fits of laughter, cutting me off. \u201cYou\u2019re kidding, right?\u201d she says as she tries to catch her breath. She holds her stomach like she\u2019s trying to stop the baby from being violently jiggled around while she laughs. \u201cOh, my God! That\u2019s hilarious! No offense, but you are so not my sister\u2019s type. I just . . .\u201d She bursts out laughing again, letting out a couple of snorts in the process. \u201cI just . . . Wait, did you actually believe I thought something was going on between you and Ashtyn?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Umm . . . \u201cNo. What\u2019s your sister\u2019s type?\u201d</p><p>She wipes her eyes and holds in her giggles. \u201cShe likes guys who are serious and dedicated and driven. That\u2019s not you at all.\u201d</p><p>Nope, that\u2019s not me. And no girl is going to turn me around, especially one who likes guys who are serious and dedicated and driven. Ashtyn and I would never work.</p><p>Even if I did want to get tangled up in the sheets with her last night.</p> <p>Chapter 24</p><p>Ashtyn</p><p>After my run with Falkor this morning, I go into Derek\u2019s room to check up on him. Bree is there, sitting next to him on the bed. If that vision wasn\u2019t enough to make me feel ill, Bree is feeding him cookies. She\u2019s got her hand poised over his mouth as he opens it like a baby bird about to be fed by its mother.</p><p>\u201cHey, Ash,\u201d Bree says when she notices me. \u201cI just came to make sure Derek was going to survive. I made him carob and wheat germ cookies because you told me he likes to eat healthy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s so . . . cute.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know, right?\u201d She feeds him another cookie. He\u2019s all too happy to munch on it while she reaches into the container for another one. \u201cHave fun at practice today.\u201d</p><p>I wave bye, knowing that I have no right to be upset that Bree has taken my place at his bedside and wants to stay there permanently. The thing with Bree is that she\u2019ll be happy with whatever attention Derek gives her. If he suddenly gets tired of the relationship, she won\u2019t be devastated. She\u2019ll start crushing on someone else right away.</p><p>My emotions don\u2019t work that way, which makes me realize that Landon and I were over long before it ended.</p><p>Landon. I have to break the news about him to my teammates sooner rather than later. I\u2019m not looking forward to it, but it has to be done. During practice, I pull Trey, Jet, and Victor aside when Dieter orders a water break.</p><p>These guys are my friends and teammates, guys I never want to let down. But they deserve to know the truth.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up, Capt\u2019n?\u201d Jet holds up a water bottle and squirts water into his mouth.</p> <p>If they only knew beforehand that voting me captain would make Landon quit the team, they\u2019d have changed their votes. All the guys would\u2019ve made sure Landon got to be captain. I\u2019m finding it hard to ask how they\u2019d feel if I turned down the captain position and offered it to Landon to lure him back to Fremont.</p><p>\u201cYou know Landon lives on the dividing line between Fremont and Fairfield, right?\u201d</p><p>Victor pats me on the back. \u201cWe know he\u2019s transferring, Ash.\u201d</p><p>What? \u201cYou knew?\u201d</p><p>They all acknowledge that they know about it, too.</p><p>\u201cSince when?\u201d</p><p>Jet and Trey both look at Victor. \u201cMy dad found out over the weekend,\u201d Vic says. \u201cOne of the assistant coaches does business with my dad, and he told him the news. Dieter knows, too. We were kind of waiting for him to break the news to you so we didn\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know if that makes them good friends or bad ones. At this point, I don\u2019t trust anything that comes out of anyone\u2019s mouth.</p> <p>When I get home, my dad is watching television in the living room. \u201cDad, I need to talk to you about football camp.\u201d</p><p>He lowers the volume. \u201cWhat about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know Landon and I were supposed to drive together in his car, but plans changed. He\u2019s going on his own. I don\u2019t have anyone else to go with and I know my car won\u2019t make it, so I was thinking that maybe you could drive me in your car or let me borrow it.\u201d I\u2019m hoping he\u2019ll feel sympathetic enough to help me out.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. I\u2019ve got to work. Find some other friends to go with, or don\u2019t go.\u201d He turns the volume back up. \u201cIt\u2019s already costing me a fortune for the tuition, and it\u2019s only one damn week. I\u2019ll be more than happy to get my money back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to go.\u201d I need to go.</p><p>He holds his hands up. \u201cThen figure it out. You know I think heading off to Texas in an attempt to get noticed by scouts is a waste of time. If you think you\u2019re going to be scouted and get a scholarship, think again. They don\u2019t recruit girls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKatie Calhoun got recruited. She\u2019s a girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKatie Calhoun is probably going to be cut or hurt her first season. Mark my words,\u201d he says.</p><p>I call Monika, but she\u2019s taking summer school and can\u2019t make it. I call Bree, but her acting agent just booked her for a short film they\u2019re filming in Chicago this summer, so she\u2019s out. Trey has to work to save money for college, Jet has to stay home to help his dad open a new restaurant, and Victor\u2019s dad threatened to cut him off if he left town.</p><p>Everything right now seems hopeless.</p><p>Four days later I\u2019m still trying to figure out how I\u2019m going to get to football camp when someone knocks on my bedroom door. \u201cIt\u2019s Derek. Open up.\u201d</p><p>I open the door and stand there looking at a very annoyed teenage boy. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d I ask him.</p><p>\u201cYou.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about me?\u201d</p><p>He throws his hands up in the air. \u201cYou\u2019re no fun to live with anymore. What happened to the girl who used to make fun of my smoothies and called me a thug? What happened with the girl who yawned when I took my shirt off when she was in bed with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t in bed with you. I was cleaning your wounds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean, c\u2019mon, we set up a routine and now you\u2019re breakin\u2019 the rules. What\u2019s up with that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re mad because we\u2019re not arguing or butting heads?\u201d I ask, completely confused at why he\u2019d care if I paid him a lick of attention or not. We argue most of the time, so what\u2019s the big deal? Bree\u2019s been hanging around him all week while I\u2019ve walked around completely depressed.</p><p>\u201cDid you even realize that I\u2019ve been takin\u2019 your damn dog for walks all week and he\u2019s been sleepin\u2019 in my room every night? Seriously, Ashtyn, I bet my left nut you wouldn\u2019t even notice if I changed his name to Duke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour left nut?\u201d I ask. \u201cWhy not your right one? Guys never say they\u2019ll bet their right nut, only their left. Why is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause all guys know their right nut is the dominant one, so bettin\u2019 the left one is a safe choice. Now don\u2019t change the subject and answer my question.\u201d</p><p>That is the most ridiculous thing I\u2019ve ever heard. I try to contain my amusement, but a laugh escapes my mouth. \u201cYou really believe your right nut is dominant? You\u2019re kidding me, right?\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t look amused. \u201cAnswer the question.\u201d</p><p>I throw my hands up. \u201cGive me a break, Derek. Can\u2019t I be depressed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>You. Football. Everything. I want to tell him the truth, but instead say, \u201cNone of your business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, fine. You\u2019ve had a few days since you and Landon broke up,\u201d he says, agitation and annoyance in his voice. \u201cSnap out of it already, it\u2019s annoyin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about if I snap out of it when you read that letter from your grandmother.\u201d There, that should get him off my back and divert his attention for the moment. Derek makes an about-face, heading back down the stairs. I follow him. \u201cYou\u2019re not about to get off that easy, Derek. You just want me to entertain you so you don\u2019t have to think about that letter. But not reading it is eating you inside, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope, not even one little bit,\u201d he says. \u201cI haven\u2019t thought about that letter or my grandmother at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiar. You want a challenge, I just gave you one.\u201d</p><p>Derek almost trips over Falkor on the way to his room. \u201cTalkin\u2019 about my grandmother or that letter is off-limits. Seriously, Ashtyn, I\u2019m not goin\u2019 there. You have no clue what that woman is capable of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you afraid of an old lady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not afraid.\u201d He tries to laugh it off, but I don\u2019t buy it for a second.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re acting like you are. She wants you to come see her before she dies, Derek. You need to go. She knows she made mistakes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re talkin\u2019 like you know the old hag,\u201d he says as he opens the container of carob cookies that Bree made him. He takes one bite of Bree\u2019s cookies and winces as if they\u2019re made from dirt. \u201cYou know nothin\u2019 about her. You read that letter and think she\u2019s a poor, dyin\u2019 old lady that deserves to have her last wish granted. Fuck that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re saying you have no problem denying an old lady her last dying wish? Really, Derek, you are heartless.\u201d</p><p>He holds out the cookie container. \u201cWant one? I warn you, they taste like a mixture between cardboard and mud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop trying to change the subject, Derek.\u201d His grandmother\u2019s letter made me cry. I wish I had a family member want to spend time with me as much as Derek\u2019s grandmother wants to spend time with him.</p><p>We\u2019re in the den now. Boxes line one side of the room. Derek\u2019s suitcases and belongings are on the other. Derek\u2019s doing his best not to pay attention to that envelope now sitting on top of one of the boxes. I put it there because he needs to read it.</p><p>\u201cWhen I told you I wanted you back the way you were, I didn\u2019t mean the annoyin\u2019 Ashtyn. I meant the Ashtyn who separated her Skittles, shoved an ice pack in my shorts, and didn\u2019t pine after her douche bag of a boyfriend just because he left her\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor your information, I\u2019m not pining for Landon.\u201d</p><p>Derek rolls his eyes. \u201cWhatever you say, Ashtyn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf talking about your grandmother is off-limits to me, talking about Landon is off-limits to you.\u201d I don\u2019t want to tell him that Landon is playing for Fairfield as a revenge move on my teammates.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. But you still need to read that letter.\u201d I leave his room.</p><p>\u201cAnd Landon is still a douche bag,\u201d he exclaims.</p><p>Chapter 25</p><p>Derek</p><p>I close the door and look at the envelope. Yesterday morning I was tempted to read it, burn it, and never think about it again.</p><p>But I didn\u2019t.</p><p>Instead, I stared at the damn thing for what seemed like forever.</p><p>While Ashtyn wants me to read the letter, Falkor doesn\u2019t seem to mind watching me do nothing except stare at it.</p><p>\u201cFalkor, catch!\u201d I toss the envelope to him like a Frisbee.</p><p>The dog watches the envelope land a few inches from his outstretched paws. He might actually be the most useless dog on the planet.</p><p>Ashtyn called me out for being afraid of reading the letter.</p><p>I\u2019m not afraid.</p><p>I was afraid of losing my mom. The day she sat me down and told me she had cancer, I was scared. Not one day went by after that when I wasn\u2019t afraid. When her blood counts were low, I thought it was the end. When she got dizzy and sick after chemo, it freaked me out. When her hair fell out and she looked fragile, I felt helpless. When I held her frail hand in the hospital when she looked like a shell of her former self, I was destroyed.</p><p>I\u2019m definitely not afraid of reading a letter from a grandmother who\u2019s a complete stranger. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Just do it already.</p><p>I pick the envelope up and sit on my bed as I open it. The letter is written on heavy pink cardstock with my grandmother\u2019s initials embossed on the top in shiny gold lettering. I think the paper was sprayed with some sort of perfume, because it smells like a woman.</p><p>Just so I don\u2019t have to listen to Ashtyn nag me about it anymore, I unfold the letter and read it.</p><p>My dearest Derek,</p> <p>I\u2019m writing this letter to you with a heavy heart. I have just been diagnosed and have been reflecting upon the mistakes I\u2019ve made in my life. There are things I need to make right before my imminent death. Since you are my one and only grandchild, it is imperative we meet after my treatment on June twentieth. It\u2019s my last, dying wish. There are things that you don\u2019t know\u2014that you need to know\u2014that you MUST know.</p><p>With Eternal Love,</p><p>Elizabeth Worthington (your grandmother)</p><p>Ashtyn was right . . . my grandmother is dying. She didn\u2019t specify what she\u2019s been diagnosed with. My mind is swirling with the possibilities. It\u2019s got to be bad since she didn\u2019t mention it. I wonder if it\u2019s lung cancer, like my mom had. My mom was one of those few unlucky souls who got lung cancer even though she didn\u2019t smoke a day in her life. Heredity and the environment were to blame, I guess.</p><p>Or maybe my grandmother has pancreatic cancer, which is a death sentence to anyone diagnosed with it.</p> <p>Or some horrible, debilitating disease that\u2019s too painful to mention.</p><p>Shit, now I can\u2019t stop thinking about it.</p><p>Most teenagers would have probably been on a plane by now, rushing to their ailing granny\u2019s side. But most teenagers don\u2019t have Elizabeth Worthington as their grandmother, famous for thinking her social status is something to admire and aspire to. I\u2019m sure she\u2019s realized by now that her blood isn\u2019t blue and no amount of money can buy health.</p><p>I read the letter two more times before placing it back in the envelope and telling myself to forget about it. I almost wish I hadn\u2019t read the thing. It\u2019s all Ashtyn\u2019s fault. If it weren\u2019t for her, I wouldn\u2019t have to carry around guilt. I need to get my mind off it, or I\u2019ll be thinking about it all night.</p><p>One person has the ability to keep my mind off that letter.</p><p>Ashtyn is in her bedroom on her laptop. Her room is pink with painted flowers running up and down the walls. She\u2019s even got little hummingbird stuffed animals on her bed. Above her desk are posters of the Chicago Bears and an eight-by-ten picture of someone named Katie Calhoun wearing a Texas football uniform.</p> <p>\u201cThis is the girliest room I\u2019ve ever been in. Just being in here makes my testosterone levels plunge.\u201d</p><p>She jerks her head up from the computer. \u201cThat\u2019s a joke, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKind of.\u201d I clear my throat and lean back on her dresser. \u201cI just wanted to tell you to be ready at seven tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou lost the bet, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, I don\u2019t have to honor that bet because you said that the letter was an invitation to join the Olympic synchronized trampoline team. You lied.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t make any difference. You said there was no Olympic synchronized trampoline team, and I bet you that there was. It\u2019s cut and dried, Ashtyn. You lost. It\u2019s time to pay up, and tonight\u2019s the night.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 26</p> <p>Ashtyn</p><p>I\u2019m sitting in my room, watching the clock. It\u2019s six thirty. I wasn\u2019t going to humor Derek and actually go on this nondate, but I don\u2019t want him thinking I\u2019m backing out of my end of the deal. Derek probably expects me to dress up, but he\u2019ll realize pretty quickly that\u2019s not the case.</p><p>I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve got bags under my eyes and look like crap because I didn\u2019t sleep much last night, perfect for my nondate with Derek. Determined to go through with this, I stumble into the bathroom to get a hair tie so I can put my hair up . . . and come face-to-face with Derek. He\u2019s leaning over the sink shaving . . . with a towel wrapped low around his waist.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t lock the door.\u201d I cover my eyes with my hand so I don\u2019t have to look at his ridiculously hot half-naked body.</p><p>\u201cIs that what you\u2019re wearin\u2019 tonight, Sugar Pie? Sweats and a T-shirt?\u201d</p><p>I keep my hand over my eyes. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>I hear him rinse his razor in the sink. \u201cSexy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not trying to be sexy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAshtyn, look at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I get a tingly sensation in the middle of my stomach because we\u2019re so close and he\u2019s only dressed in a towel that shows off his \u201cV\u201d and I\u2019m trying to keep my distance even though I don\u2019t want to. \u201cYou might want to pull up your towel. It\u2019s falling off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not falling off unless you pull it off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wish.\u201d I take my hand from my eyes. \u201cI think you have a self-esteem problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSelf-esteem problem?\u201d He looks at me sideways, then chuckles. \u201cYeah, okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDerek,\u201d I say in the most soft, feminine voice. \u201cAdmitting it is the first step to recovery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sayin\u2019 I don\u2019t got problems, but self-esteem probably isn\u2019t one of \u2019em. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re back to your old self. You wanna stand here and watch me shave, I\u2019m cool with that. It\u2019ll boost whatever self-esteem you seem to think I\u2019m lacking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to watch you, Derek. I want a hair tie.\u201d I reach around him and pull one out of the drawer. The smell of his freshly washed skin mixed with whatever cologne he\u2019s wearing envelops my senses. I wish he hadn\u2019t taken a shower as if he was getting ready for a real date. This isn\u2019t a real date. It\u2019s payment for losing a bet.</p><p>\u201cWant to give me a hint where we\u2019re going?\u201d I ask him so I can prepare myself for the worst.</p><p>\u201cNope. Don\u2019t you like surprises?\u201d</p><p>I was surprised when my parents announced they were getting divorced. I was surprised when my mom packed up and left. I was surprised when Brandi disappeared with Nick. I look at him with a completely serious expression. \u201cNot. At. All.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s too bad.\u201d He raises a brow and smiles mischievously. \u201cI love surprises.\u201d</p><p>I close the door and walk back to my room to wait until exactly seven before going downstairs for the nondate.</p><p>My sister and Julian are playing some card game in the living room when I walk downstairs ten minutes later. Derek is probably in his room, contemplating the best way to make my life miserable. He doesn\u2019t know how I feel about him . . . he can\u2019t know how I feel about him. Hiding my true feelings will be so hard. I\u2019m going to have to sabotage our night together as much as I can.</p><p>\u201cDerek said you guys were going out,\u201d Brandi says. \u201cThat\u2019s so nice you two are getting along. It looks like you\u2019re turning over a new leaf. I like that.\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>My sister claps excitedly. \u201cWhat are you gonna wear?\u201d</p><p>I gesture to my sweats. \u201cThis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she says, confused that I\u2019d pick something so casual. \u201cUmm . . . do you want to wear something of mine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. This is perfectly fine. I\u2019m comfy.\u201d</p><p>Clearly she doesn\u2019t agree that comfy is the best attire for going out on a Saturday night. \u201cTry something else on. Maybe comfy isn\u2019t the best idea, especially when a boy is taking you out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a boy. It\u2019s Derek,\u201d I tell her.</p><p>\u201cYou ready?\u201d a clean-shaven Derek says from behind me. He\u2019s wearing jeans and a button-down shirt that I\u2019ve never seen him wear before. And a pair of cowboy boots. His hair is still wet. He looks like he\u2019s about to go on a real date. Time to make sure he knows that I\u2019m not about to make this thing official.</p><p>I glance at my cell phone. \u201cOkay, it\u2019s five past seven. Where are we going and when are we going to be back?\u201d I slip into my fuzzy UGG slippers, getting a chuckle from Derek and a gasp from my sister.</p><p>\u201cI told you it\u2019s a surprise.\u201d He holds up the keys to his SUV. \u201cLet\u2019s roll.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI better be back by ten,\u201d I tell him when we\u2019re on the road to who-knows-where.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re damn sexy with those sweats on,\u201d he says sarcastically as he eyes my outfit.</p><p>\u201cThank you. Where are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your hair. It must\u2019ve taken you forever to get it just right.\u201d</p><p>It did take me a while to get my hair up in a messy bun, with strands sticking out every which way. \u201cWhere did you say we were going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t.\u201d He pulls onto the highway, following signs to Chicago. \u201cWhy do you play football?\u201d he asks me after a while. \u201cI know a bunch of girls who like it, but they either become groupies or cheerleaders. They don\u2019t play it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t play anymore, so you won\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry me.\u201d</p><p>At first I\u2019m not going to tell him. But then when I look at his face all serious, I let him know the truth. \u201cI always watched football with my dad. I\u2019m sure you know by now he\u2019s kinda . . . rough around the edges. He wasn\u2019t always like that. We used to bond over football. He was the kicker for Fremont.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you wanted to play to get his attention.\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cIt didn\u2019t work, but that didn\u2019t matter. It was something I was good at, something that could take my mind off whatever crap was happening in my real life. I bet you think that\u2019s stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s stupid, Ashtyn. Not by a long shot.\u201d After a while he adds, \u201cYour dad\u2019s missin\u2019 out.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s the first person to tell me that. I don\u2019t answer, because my eyes well up and I can\u2019t talk. I wanted my dad to watch me play and be proud that I was following in his footsteps. But I might as well be invisible.</p><p>Derek ends up parking the car at this place called Jumpin\u2019 Jack.</p><p>\u201cWhat are we doing here, Derek?\u201d</p><p>We walk in the place. It\u2019s a big gymnasium full of trampolines. A guy and girl wearing matching red leotards greet us at the entrance.</p><p>\u201cWelcome to Jumpin\u2019 Jack. I\u2019m Jack and this is my partner, Gretchen. You two must be Derek and Ashtyn.\u201d</p><p>Derek shakes Jumpin\u2019 Jack\u2019s hand. \u201cYep. Thanks for takin\u2019 us on short notice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur pleasure. Ashtyn will follow Gretchen to the women\u2019s locker room, while you\u2019ll follow me to the men\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>I tap Derek\u2019s back. I watched videos of synchronized trampo-lining. I have a dreaded feeling I\u2019m not about to be a spectator. \u201cDerek, please tell me we\u2019re not doing what I think we\u2019re doing.\u201d</p><p>He winks at me. \u201cMy mother always said to be unpredictable and you\u2019ll never get bored.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t want to be unpredictable. Unpredictable is reckless and dangerous. Unpredictable brings out the unknown. I thought Landon was predictable and he wasn\u2019t. I know Derek is unpredictable. I don\u2019t want to fall into his web, because it\u2019ll only end in disaster. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Against my better judgment, I follow Gretchen and find myself face-to-face with a shiny blue leotard hanging in one of the cubbies in the locker room. Gretchen, who can probably fit into a keyhole she\u2019s so petite, says in a heavy Russian accent, \u201cPut it on, then meet me in the gym.\u201d</p><p>When she walks out of the room, I stare at the blue spandex and think . . . what horrible thing did I do in my life to deserve this?</p><p>Chapter 27</p><p>Derek</p> <p>I look ridiculous and stupid. As I check myself in the bathroom mirror, I want to back out. I\u2019m wearing a skintight leotard/ bodysuit obviously designed by women who have no clue about men\u2019s plumbing, because the outline of my dick is obscene. Don\u2019t dudes who do this sport wear a cup or something? I\u2019ve been on a trampoline, but I\u2019ve never done synchronized trampolining. Looking at myself in the mirror, I can see why. I thought having a private trampoline session with two pros would be funny, something completely off the wall. This idea has completely backfired.</p><p>I hear a loud knock. \u201cDerek, come out!\u201d Jumpin\u2019 Jack bellows through the men\u2019s dressing room door.</p><p>I adjust and hope I can avoid further embarrassment by not getting a hard-on during this training session. When I walk into the gym, Ashtyn\u2019s standing atop the center trampoline wearing a matching skintight leotard that leaves nothing to the imagination.</p><p>Her gaze moves downward and her hand flies to her mouth as she giggles. \u201cOh my . . . Derek, your, umm . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuge, I know. Stop staring at it or soon you\u2019ll be seein\u2019 how impressive it really gets.\u201d I gesture to her chest. \u201cYou cold, Sugar Pie?\u201d</p> <p>She crosses her arms on her chest when she realizes that I\u2019m not the only one with body parts sticking out.</p><p>\u201cHold hands,\u201d Gretchen instructs.</p><p>Ashtyn stares at my hands as if she\u2019s not about to touch them anytime soon.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t we jump on separate trampolines?\u201d I ask. This wasn\u2019t supposed to be an intimate holding-hands session. I\u2019ve seen the videos online. We\u2019re supposed to be jumping on two different trampolines.</p><p>\u201cYou need to find and feel each other\u2019s rhythm first.\u201d</p><p>Sounds like screwing, not trampolining, but I\u2019m game. I hold out my hands. Ashtyn takes a deep breath, then slides her hands on top of mine. Her touch sends a jolt of electricity through me. I look for a sign to see if she feels it, too. She obviously doesn\u2019t, because her eyes are averted and she looks like she\u2019d like to be anywhere but here.</p> <p>\u201cStart jumping!\u201d Jumpin\u2019 Jack orders.</p><p>We do. Ashtyn tries to stay upright, but falls backward. Since our hands are still attached, I almost fall on top of her.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I mumble. This is way closer than I thought we\u2019d be, and it\u2019s throwing me off my game. Tonight was supposed to make me stop thinking about my grandmother. It was supposed to be entertaining, mocking her and the nondate I manipulated her to go on in the first place.</p><p>Ashtyn stands and holds out her hands so we can try again. \u201cThis is ridiculous. You know that, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFeel my rhythm,\u201d I say, then wink at her in an attempt to make light of the situation.</p><p>She tilts her head and smiles sweetly. \u201cFuck you.\u201d</p><p>She tries to pull her hands away, but I hold tight and keep jumping.</p><p>\u201cFeel your partner\u2019s energy,\u201d Jack instructs. \u201cDon\u2019t fight it. Match it, imitate it, until you\u2019re of one mind.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNext time we go out, remind me to wear a sports bra,\u201d Ashtyn mumbles. \u201cAnd you\u2019d be better off wearing a jockstrap.\u201d</p><p>I try to hide a smile. \u201cYou\u2019re already looking forward to the next time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I just meant . . . Forget what I meant and concentrate,\u201d she says, flustered.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re cute when you\u2019re nervous, Sugar Pie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not nervous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure you are. Your palms are sweaty and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop talking and focus!\u201d Gretchen yells.</p><p>It takes us fifteen minutes before Jumpin\u2019 Jack announces that we\u2019re ready to separate and try side-by-side trampolines. With each jump, Ashtyn seems to relax. We\u2019ve finally gotten the hang of it and she even starts smiling and letting out little laughs when we mess up. Jumpin\u2019 Jack and Gretchen both take this jumping stuff way more seriously than it needs to be, which is comedy. Gretchen scolds us every time Ashtyn and I talk or laugh, which makes us laugh even more.</p><p>\u201cWhen you jump in sync,\u201d Gretchen says after Jumpin\u2019 Jack teaches us a few tricks, \u201cyour bodies and souls become one entity. It\u2019s like making love.\u201d</p><p>I look over at Ashtyn and our eyes lock. I imagine what it would be like to be intimate with her, with her looking up at me with those expressive eyes and full lips. At first I\u2019d take it slow, savoring each moment . . . then I\u2019d let her set the pace. Would she let down her fierce protective shell, or would it always be there, a reminder that she\u2019ll never fully let go of her inhibitions?</p><p>Shit, I better stop those wayward thoughts before everyone in the room knows what I\u2019m thinking. If Ashtyn knew what was on my mind, she\u2019d probably punch me in the groin\u2014which she\u2019d have no problem finding in this leotard. I tell myself I\u2019m sexually frustrated because I haven\u2019t hooked up with a girl in a few months. I need to fix that, and not with a girl like Ashtyn. She\u2019s made for guys who want a commitment. I\u2019m made for girls who want a good time. While we might be jumping in sync, our personalities when it comes to dating clash like oil and water.</p><p>At the end of the hour, and a picture that Gretchen insists we take in our leotards, we\u2019ve mastered how to jump and do a few tricks in sync. Gretchen and Jumpin\u2019 Jack are impressed with our progress and invite us back anytime for another lesson.</p><p>In the car, Ashtyn and I are silent as I drive to dinner. I\u2019m still trying to convince myself I\u2019m not attracted to her. We\u2019re not in sync at all, in anything. Except trampolining. We rocked it tonight.</p><p>\u201cTrampolining was a really stupid idea,\u201d Ashtyn says. She\u2019s back in her sweats, looking like she\u2019s ready for an intense workout at the gym instead of a night out on the town.</p><p>\u201cYou liked it. Admit it.\u201d</p><p>She shifts in the seat and looks out my car window. \u201cI won\u2019t admit anything. Now take me home so I can pig out. I\u2019m starving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m takin\u2019 you to dinner.\u201d I pull into the parking lot of White Fence Farm in a town called Romeoville.</p><p>\u201cWhite Fence Farm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSupposedly they have the world\u2019s best chicken, made from real chickens. Admit that you have no clue what\u2019s in that frozen crap your sister heats up every night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI happen to like frozen crap, thank you very much.\u201d</p><p>We have to wait over an hour for a table, so Ashtyn walks around the little antique museum inside the restaurant. She looks appreciatively at one of the vintage cars in the museum case. A slimy guy sagging his pants and looking like he\u2019s on the prowl walks up next to her. He says something I can\u2019t hear, then smiles when she answers him.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up, man?\u201d I say to the dude as I put my arm around Ashtyn\u2019s shoulder. He takes the hint and walks away.</p><p>Ashtyn brushes my hand off. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMakin\u2019 sure that guy knows you\u2019re not available. Didn\u2019t anyone tell you not to talk to guys who are just lookin\u2019 for a piece of ass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTakes one to know one, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomethin\u2019 like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe the guy was just trying to be nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>She winds through the crowded museum back to the front of the restaurant. When we\u2019re finally seated across from a bunch of guys wearing T-shirts that say ROMEOVILLE HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL on them, Ashtyn is silent.</p><p>\u201cYou gonna talk?\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t look up from the cartoon picture of a chicken on her plate. \u201cI don\u2019t feel like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s a good thing this isn\u2019t a date. If this was, you\u2019d definitely be a dud.\u201d She opens her mouth to protest, but the waitress comes. She\u2019s a big woman with red curly hair who introduces herself as Tracie. She does her welcome greeting, then takes our order.</p><p>\u201cOur sides are bottomless, so feel free to ask for more,\u201d Tracie says with a smile, then leans in to whisper something important. \u201cOur corn fritters are legendary and addictive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank goodness,\u201d I tell Tracie, who looks like she\u2019s eaten one too many fritters in her lifetime. \u201cBecause my girlfriend here is legendary and addictive. Right, Sugar Pie?\u201d</p><p>Ashtyn shakes her head, then kicks me under the table. Poor Tracie. Her smile fades as she doesn\u2019t know how to respond, so she excuses herself and says the food will be out shortly.</p><p>\u201cThank goodness this isn\u2019t a real date,\u201d Ashtyn says. \u201cBecause if it were, I\u2019d already have called a cab and been on my way back to Fremont.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf this were a real date, we\u2019d already be in the backseat of my car with our clothes off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEww. Wanna bet?\u201d Ashtyn says.</p><p>I grin wide.</p><p>She holds up a hand. \u201cForget I said that.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 28</p><p>Ashtyn</p><p>I\u2019m glad those guys from Romeoville don\u2019t recognize me. We played them this year and beat them 21\u201320 in the first round of the playoffs. A fight broke out between our players after I\u2019d kicked the field goal to win the game. Police were called in to break it up.</p><p>Derek waves a hand in front of my face. \u201cStop lookin\u2019 at other guys when you\u2019re with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not looking at other guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not an idiot, Ashtyn. Every two seconds you\u2019re checkin\u2019 out the football players at that table behind me. Obviously you\u2019ve got a thing for jocks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not. They\u2019re . . . rivals. I just hope they don\u2019t recognize me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen stop lookin\u2019 at \u2019em and pay attention to your date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHumor me and pretend it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would Bree say if she knew you and I were out on a date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBree?\u201d He laughs. \u201cShe just wanted to hook up. Nothin\u2019 more than that.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t want to know how much he hooked up with Bree. I don\u2019t like guys who think they\u2019re God\u2019s gift to girls and have no goals except to get with as many girls as possible, which is the definition of Derek Fitzpatrick. So why do I like being here with him, trying to one-up him on the witty comment scale? The guy makes stupid jokes and doesn\u2019t take anything seriously\u2014especially his relationships with girls. I mean, who thinks of taking a girl on a date to learn synchronized trampolining?</p><p>Not that this is a date. It\u2019s not. It\u2019s paying for a lost bet, nothing more. Sure, Derek\u2019s pretending it\u2019s a real date, but that\u2019s only because he likes playing games. Taking me out is just another game to him, another way for him to amuse himself.</p><p>When Tracie brings the corn fritters piled up in a little white ceramic bowl, I sample one. I swear the fritter practically melts in my mouth, perfectly warm and sweet. It\u2019s everything Tracie said it would be and more. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I pop one after another into my mouth while Derek watches me with those electric blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou have to try one,\u201d I tell him. Tracie brings a second helping after I\u2019ve devoured the first.</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re amazing, Derek. Seriously addictive.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cObviously.\u201d</p><p>I lean across the table and hold up a fritter. \u201cTry it. It\u2019s fresh, and has corn in it. Consider it a vegetable, surrounded by tasty goodness.\u201d</p><p>He looks at the fritter, then at me. \u201cYou eat it.\u201d</p><p>When I see it\u2019s useless, I pop it into my mouth. No need to waste a good fritter on someone who won\u2019t appreciate it.</p><p>Tracie brings the rest of our meal. Derek takes a bite of chicken and moans. \u201cThis is the way chicken should taste.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m surprised Derek enjoys the chicken as much as he does. He even reaches over and grabs the wing off my plate when I mention that I\u2019m stuffed and can\u2019t eat another bite. It makes me think of Trey and Monika, who share food all the time. Landon and I never shared food.</p><p>Okay. I admit it. This night does feel like a date. When we were on the trampoline holding hands, I couldn\u2019t look him in the eye. Derek has strong, capable hands that mow lawns and fix old sheds with rusty hammers. My heart skipped a beat when he almost fell on top of me on the trampoline and I could feel his body close to mine. When we jumped in sync, I felt a connection. I know it sounds ridiculous, and I\u2019m sure Derek would laugh if I mentioned it, but I could sense when he was going to jump without even having to look at him.</p><p>After dinner, he drives back home.</p><p>I don\u2019t make eye contact when he parks in our driveway, because I might be tempted to lean in and kiss him. \u201cI had a really . . . interesting time tonight.\u201d I don\u2019t want to tell him the truth . . . that tonight was the first night in a long time I forgot to be depressed.</p><p>I\u2019m super confused and emotional. I don\u2019t want to do anything I\u2019ll regret. I open the door, but Derek reaches over to stop me from getting out.</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d he says. \u201cI wanted to give you somethin\u2019 . . .\u201d He reaches into the backseat and grabs a football. \u201cHere. It\u2019s signed by the \u201992 Dallas Cowboys. It\u2019s even got Aikman\u2019s signature.\u201d</p> <p>My fingers trace the signatures. I\u2019m holding a piece of Texas history. \u201cHow\u2019d you get this?\u201d</p><p>He shrugs. \u201cMy grandmother sent it for my birthday a while back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is really cool, Derek. You should keep it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to have it.\u201d</p><p>I give him a big hug. \u201cThanks, Cowboy.\u201d</p><p>I intend to pull away immediately, but when he hugs me back I find myself closing my eyes and lingering in his warm embrace. I\u2019ve wanted this. I\u2019ve waited for this. My heart is beating fast and I feel out of breath with his strong hands on my back.</p><p>I lean back slowly. Our gazes lock. His eyes practically shine in the dark.</p><p>His gaze moves down to my lips. \u201cI want to kiss you so bad right now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you usually ask a girl, or do you just do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUsually I just do it.\u201d</p><p>The words come out without my brain contemplating the consequences. \u201cSo what are you waiting for?\u201d</p><p>The side of his mouth quirks up, but it\u2019s not from cockiness. I think he\u2019s shocked that I haven\u2019t punched him in the face or left the car. I\u2019m challenging him. His hand cups the back of my neck, his thumb slightly caressing my sensitive skin. Oh, I am in so much trouble right now because I want this so bad.</p><p>My breath hitches when Derek leans forward. I wet my lips with the tip of my tongue, eager to see what it feels like to have his lips pressed against mine.</p><p>His breathing is ragged. \u201cDamn, that\u2019s sexy.\u201d</p><p>I smile wide. \u201cYou know we shouldn\u2019t play games like this.\u201d My teasing lips are a whisper away from his.</p><p>\u201cI know. This is a really bad idea,\u201d he agrees, but doesn\u2019t seem to want to retreat.</p><p>\u201cYou better be as good at this as you think you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good, Sugar Pie.\u201d</p><p>I move back just the slightest bit, knowing I should protect myself and run into the house, but I want to continue to play the game. He wants this to be a game, so I\u2019m playing it the only way I know how. I know guys like Derek. They like challenges and the cat and mouse game.</p><p>Time to play the mouse.</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d I place a hand on his chest. I feel the muscles beneath his shirt and the fast pounding of his heart. \u201cOur kissing styles probably aren\u2019t compatible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry me,\u201d he whispers, then moves in and places slow, thoughtful little kisses on my lips. I fight the urge to moan. Those little kisses are meant to drive me insane. And they are. Damn him!</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cUmm. . . .\u201d</p><p>His tongue traces the line between my lips.</p><p>\u201cAnd that?\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s it. I\u2019m definitely going all in for this now. I grab the back of his neck and pull him closer so we\u2019re full-on kissing and my lips are crushing against his and he feels so different and good and my body is starting to turn into liquid fire . . .</p><p>His lips urge mine open. His hot slippery tongue searches for mine. Our tongues mingle in a sexy dance. I like this way too much.</p><p>\u201cI think we\u2019re compatible,\u201d he groans against my mouth.</p><p>\u201cYou think?\u201d I\u2019m panting and wanting this to last longer.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should keep doing it, just to make sure.\u201d His hand reaches up and he slowly slides the ponytail holder out of my hair, which falls around my shoulders. \u201cHey,\u201d he says. \u201cWhy are your eyes closed?\u201d</p><p>I shrug.</p><p>\u201cLook at me, Ashtyn. I don\u2019t want to be some faceless guy.\u201d</p><p>I open my eyes. His lips glisten in the faint light from the porch.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re like a warrior princess, you know that?\u201d He gently swipes my hair out of my face. \u201cSo beautiful.\u201d The moment is too intense and feels so real. It doesn\u2019t feel like a game, even though I know it is. It\u2019s confusing my already raw emotions, which is exactly what he wants.</p><p>\u201cAre you being serious?\u201d</p><p>My question has lots of implications, because if he\u2019s serious, that means the game-playing is over.</p><p>He hesitates, then leans back in the driver\u2019s seat. \u201cYou should know me by now. I don\u2019t take anything seriously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn fact,\u201d he adds, \u201cI was hopin\u2019 you\u2019d let me take a pic of you and me makin\u2019 out so I can post it on the Internet and piss off your ex-boyfriend. How about it?\u201d</p><p>A picture to post on the Internet? I almost got sucked into spilling all my feelings to Derek, when all along this was just a joke to him. I\u2019m the punch line.</p><p>\u201cHow about this nondate being officially over.\u201d I push him away and rush out of the car as I vow never to play kissing games with Derek Fitzpatrick again.</p><p>Chapter 29</p><p>Derek</p><p>Well, I\u2019m a certified asshole. I didn\u2019t mean to hook up with Ashtyn. Kissing her felt damn good . . . and made me want to lose control with her. Which is why I made up that idiotic story about posting a picture of us kissing online. I didn\u2019t know any other way to push her far enough away so she\u2019d hate me.</p><p>Ashtyn isn\u2019t just any random girl. She\u2019s Brandi\u2019s sister and a girl who\u2019d never hook up with a guy without thinking that she\u2019d end up in a serious relationship. Her mom left her, her sister left her, her dad might as well have left her. I need her to think I\u2019m an asshole, because no matter what happens between us, I\u2019m leaving soon and I\u2019m not coming back.</p><p>I set the football in front of her bedroom door, knowing it\u2019s a lame peace offering but not knowing what else to do or say. I knew she liked it by the way she studied the Dallas Cowboys\u2019 signatures as if they held some secret football code.</p><p>In the morning, Brandi comes in my room while I\u2019m still half-asleep. She\u2019s wearing shorts and a T-shirt that hugs her pregnant belly. Falkor trots in behind her with a chewed-up football in his mouth. He sits next to my bed and drops the drool-covered, deflated ball. Aikman\u2019s signature is torn in half . . . some of it is missing, probably been swallowed by the beast.</p><p>\u201cHe ate it,\u201d I mumble in shock.</p><p>\u201cI know, isn\u2019t that so cute! Ashtyn was tossing it to him this morning in the front yard, teaching him how to play fetch.\u201d</p><p>Shit. Ashtyn really knows how to say fuck you without uttering a word.</p><p>\u201cI have an appointment for an ultrasound next week,\u201d my stepmother says in an excited tone. \u201cI want you to come with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, come on. Since your dad\u2019s not here, I really really want you and Julian to be there.\u201d The woman doesn\u2019t realize that it might be weird for me to go to her ultrasound. \u201cI can take you and Julian out afterward, like . . .\u201d I can practically hear the rusty wheels in her brain turning. \u201cI\u2019ll take you guys, like, apple picking afterward. You\u2019ll love it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cApple-picking season isn\u2019t until the fall,\u201d I inform her.</p><p>\u201cOh. Right. We can do something else, then. Something super fun. Super.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about we just go to lunch.\u201d At least I can be spared having to eat another one of her home-cooked meals. I sit up and try not to stare at her growing belly.</p><p>\u201cDoes that mean you\u2019ll go?\u201d</p><p>I look at her pleading face and feel sorry for her. I guess if she were my wife, I\u2019d want someone to go with her. \u201cYeah, I\u2019ll go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Derek! You\u2019re The Best!\u201d She attempts to sit on the edge of my bed, but loses her balance and almost tumbles off until I reach out to steady her. Giving up on sitting, she stands next to my bed and rests her hands atop her stomach. \u201cSo . . . I hear from a little birdie that you got a letter from your grandmother. That\u2019s nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d If she knew my grandmother only cared about herself and would probably insult Brandi on sight, I don\u2019t think she\u2019d think it was nice.</p><p>\u201cWhat did she say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat she\u2019s joinin\u2019 the circus as the bearded lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not really. She\u2019s dyin\u2019 and wants me to visit her in Texas.\u201d She cocks her head. \u201cIs that another joke?\u201d \u201cNo joke. I\u2019m gonna visit her.\u201d After last night, I realized Ashtyn is my kryptonite. I feel myself getting too close and need to back off.</p><p>I hear the front door slam. Ashtyn must\u2019ve left for practice and she\u2019s obviously still mad. Two hours later, when she pulls into the driveway in her beat-up car and I\u2019m fixing the broken slats on the shed, I still don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to say to her.</p><p>She limps into the house. Her hair is in a low ponytail and she\u2019s got grass stains on her pants. She definitely had a rough practice. I tell myself to leave her alone, but I can\u2019t get her off my mind. I find her in the living room soaking her foot in a bucket of ice. Brandi is painting her nails and Julian is sitting next to Ashtyn watching TV.</p><p>\u201cAshtyn, can we talk?\u201d I ask. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d She gestures to the bucket with her foot inside it. \u201cI\u2019m kind of indisposed and am sick of playing games. Call Bree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t give me crap. I didn\u2019t plan last night to play out the way it did.\u201d</p><p>Julian taps me on the leg. \u201cDerek, you said \u2018crap.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p> <p>He leans in close and whispers, \u201cIt\u2019s a bad word.\u201d</p><p>Brandi nods. \u201cIt\u2019s written on our no-no word list. You can\u2019t say it.\u201d</p><p>Only Brandi could have a no-no word list.</p><p>\u201c\u2018Crap\u2019 is not a bad word.\u201d I look to Ashtyn for confirmation, but she shrugs like she has no opinion whatsoever. The girl can think of an argument for any little thing, but when it comes to backing me up, she\u2019s at a loss for words. \u201cI can think of a ton of other words that are way worse than \u2018crap.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop saying it.\u201d Ashtyn joins the no-no list brigade. \u201cYou\u2019re corrupting my nephew.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re just pissed at me \u2019cause of last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so wrong,\u201d Ashtyn says. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t be more wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, did I miss something? What happened last night?\u201d Brandi asks.</p><p>Ashtyn gives me a level stare. \u201cNothing happened. Right, Derek?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere did you two go?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTrampolining, then White Fence Farm,\u201d Ashtyn says.</p><p>Brandi puts down her polish and furrows her brows. \u201cThen why are you pissed at him? It sounds like fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it, Brandi. Okay? You just keep thinking that Derek\u2019s perfect just like everyone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNobody\u2019s perfect,\u201d I tell her. \u201cNot even you, Ashtyn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never once said I was perfect. In fact, I\u2019m an idiot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoin the club.\u201d</p><p>When Gus arrives home a few minutes later, he takes one look at Ashtyn with her foot in the ice bucket and mumbles something about canceling football camp and getting his money back.</p><p>\u201cWhat football camp?\u201d Brandi asks.</p> <p>\u201cYour sister wants to drive to some football camp in Texas. By herself,\u201d Gus announces. \u201cIt\u2019s not happening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, I have an idea!\u201d Brandi, my scatterbrained stepmother, whirls around and looks at me as if I will save the day. She claps her hands, careful not to ruin her freshly manicured nails and says excitedly, \u201cDerek is going to Texas to visit his grandmother. Derek can drop Ashtyn at football camp, then go see his grandmother. Then he can pick Ashtyn back up and come home. It\u2019s the perfect solution!\u201d</p><p>Everyone\u2019s eyes are on me. What, does Brandi think that putting us in a car together will miraculously fix whatever\u2019s wrong in her sister\u2019s life? Not gonna happen. \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>Ashtyn nods. \u201cI agree. That\u2019s the worst idea.\u201d</p><p>Gus nods. \u201cThen it\u2019s settled, Ashtyn. You\u2019re not going.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 30</p><p>Ashtyn</p><p>I spend the next two hours calling everyone I know outside of my core group of friends. Nobody can make the trip to Texas with me. I\u2019m out of options . . . almost.</p><p>Derek.</p><p>I\u2019d rather eat nothing but green smoothies for an entire week than be stuck with him on a road trip. I made a complete fool out of myself on our nondate, and feel like an idiot because every time I think of his hands on my body or the way his tongue slid against mine, my knees go weak and I get a tingling sensation in my stomach. I hate myself for falling into Derek\u2019s trap.</p><p>I close my eyes and take a deep breath, then try to come up with a plan on how to get to Texas without Derek. Ugh, it\u2019s impossible.</p><p>Derek is the only person who can help me. I find him outside, on top of the shed, shirtless. He\u2019s hammering a nail, but all I can think about is getting carried away feeling those tight abs last night. I wish I could wipe that memory from my brain, but it\u2019s obvious that\u2019s not about to happen.</p><p>\u201cI need to talk to you,\u201d I say.</p><p>He continues to pound away. \u201cWhy? You ready to talk about why you\u2019re so pissed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really, but I don\u2019t have a choice.\u201d I sigh. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have kissed you last night. Or let you kiss me. It was a huge mistake that I\u2019ll regret forever. I\u2019m pissed at you for tempting me and I\u2019m mad at myself for letting it happen. You got me at a weak moment and it sucks knowing I can\u2019t turn back time and erase it. There, I said it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForever\u2019s a long time, you know,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m well aware of that, thank you,\u201d I say. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to ask you this, but I need your help with the whole driving-to-Texas thing so I can go to football camp. I\u2019ve called everyone I know and even some people I don\u2019t really know. Nobody can do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m your last choice, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>He jumps off the roof of the shed and walks up to me. \u201cYou made the rule that we weren\u2019t supposed to get into each other\u2019s business. Last night we did and look what happened. I\u2019d say drivin\u2019 you out of state and sleepin\u2019 at campgrounds in a tent together definitely counts as gettin\u2019 into each other\u2019s business.\u201d</p><p>Wait. I think I heard him right, but I\u2019m not sure. \u201cCampgrounds?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like to rough it.\u201d</p><p>Roughing it isn\u2019t my thing, but I\u2019m desperate, so I lie and put on a big, fake smile. \u201cI love camping!\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head. \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>I shield my eyes as I look up at him. \u201cYou wanted me to challenge you and argue with you. I\u2019m willing to keep playing this game if you are, minus the kissing and touching part. Think of all the time we\u2019ll have to argue and annoy each other driving to Texas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds temptin\u2019, but after last night, that\u2019s probably the worst idea. Ever.\u201d He points to the chewed-up football. \u201cOh, yeah. And thanks for feedin\u2019 the football I gave you to your dog. I\u2019ll bet it\u2019s sacrilegious to destroy Troy Aikman\u2019s signature, but don\u2019t worry. I won\u2019t out you.\u201d</p><p>He heads for the house. I can\u2019t let him walk away from me, not now. I catch up and stand in his way.</p><p>He gently nudges me aside. \u201cSorry, Ashtyn. I can\u2019t help ya.\u201d</p><p>Time to let it all out, no matter if my ego is bruised. \u201cWait! Derek, football means everything to me. I need to go to Texas. I need to prove to everyone else and myself that I deserve to be there as much as any guy. I didn\u2019t tell you before, but Landon left our team to play for our rivals. I refuse to give up, even though everything seems useless now.\u201d I look away because my eyes are starting to tear up. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand. I don\u2019t have anything else besides football.\u201d I gesture to Falkor, whose head is resting on Derek\u2019s feet. \u201cI don\u2019t even have my dog anymore because he likes you better. I don\u2019t have much, and I don\u2019t ask for much. You\u2019re my last hope.\u201d</p><p>I take a deep, shaky breath, knowing full well that my tears are on the brink of overflowing. Derek rubs the back of his neck, deep in thought.</p><p>\u201cSorry, can\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cName your price,\u201d I offer in desperation.</p><p>\u201cMy price?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Just throw out a number.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA million dollars,\u201d he says.</p><p>Yeah, right. \u201cObviously I don\u2019t have a million dollars.\u201d I calculate how much money I\u2019ve saved up from babysitting, holidays, and birthdays. My dad gave me cash for special occasions\u2014his consolation prize for my crappy home life. \u201cI\u2019ll pay you a hundred bucks and I\u2019ll split the cost of gas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a hundred?\u201d he asks, unimpressed. \u201cThat\u2019s less than minimum wage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is a cash job, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not takin\u2019 the stress factor into consideration. Dealin\u2019 with you, Sugar Pie, ain\u2019t a piece of cake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll throw in two boxes of granola bars for the car ride.\u201d I hold out my hand. \u201cDeal?\u201d</p><p>He looks at my hand for a long time. Then he shakes his head. \u201cListen, Ashtyn. I don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Derek. This isn\u2019t a joke. I don\u2019t have anyone I can count on anymore. My boyfriend ditched me, we don\u2019t have a decent quarterback. My life is a complete mess. I\u2019m, like, drowning here. Prove to me that it\u2019s not all hopeless.\u201d</p><p>He rubs his neck again, then sighs a few times as he looks across the yard. Finally he says, \u201cAll right. Deal.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 31</p><p>Derek</p><p>I got suckered into coming to Illinois.</p><p>I got suckered into going to Texas.</p><p>I got suckered into going on a road trip with a girl who makes me want to kiss her and stay far away from her at the same time.</p><p>How the hell does this stuff happen to me? I couldn\u2019t say no to Ashtyn when she talked about how much football and this trip meant to her. Once upon a time football meant that much to me.</p><p>Ashtyn has that spark I used to have. I see it in her eyes. I don\u2019t know what she thinks she\u2019ll accomplish by going to football camp, but I have no doubt she\u2019s going to use everything in her arsenal to get noticed by scouts.</p><p>Four days later, we load up my SUV. Ashtyn made a big deal out of raiding the pantry for junk food to chow on during the drive. I stuck some granola bars Ashtyn bought in my backpack, but decide to bring stuff to make my own food.</p><p>\u201cWhat is that?\u201d Ashtyn asks as I walk out of the house.</p><p>\u201cA blender.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re bringing a blender on a road trip?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d Give me some bananas and spinach and I\u2019ll have a good breakfast. If Ashtyn thinks I\u2019m going to eat candy or cookies for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, she better think again.</p><p>After saying our good-byes to Brandi, Julian, and Gus, we\u2019re ready to get out of town.</p><p>Falkor jumps in the backseat when I open the door.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not invited.\u201d He looks at me with droopy eyes and doesn\u2019t move. Ashtyn tries to get him out, but he doesn\u2019t move until I say, \u201cOut!\u201d</p><p>Suddenly Julian is at my side, hugging my legs with his little kid arms. \u201cYou\u2019ll come back, right?\u201d</p><p>I kneel down to him. \u201cOf course I\u2019ll come back.\u201d</p><p>Ashtyn peeks out of the window. \u201cHey, Julian. You want to give me a hug, too?\u201d</p><p>Julian nods.</p><p>Ashtyn gets out of the car and kneels down. She pulls him toward her and hugs him. That hug is full of warmth and emotion . . . she doesn\u2019t want to let him go. It\u2019s like she\u2019s craving the unconditional love Julian\u2019s giving her right now. It\u2019s something I could never give her.</p><p>Ashtyn kicks her shoes off and makes herself comfortable after we pull onto the highway. Soon, we\u2019re out of the city and see nothing but farms and a lone hawk flying overhead.</p><p>\u201cYou hungry?\u201d She reaches into her backpack and pulls out some crackers and a can of cheese spread. \u201cWant some?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not gonna kill you, Derek.\u201d She holds a cracker, piled high with semiliquefied cheese, in front of my mouth. \u201cTry it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I open my mouth and she shoves the cracker in, her finger-tips touching my lips and almost lingering there until I close my mouth. It feels like an intimate moment, but that\u2019s nuts. She was just feeding me a cracker, not trying to flirt.</p><p>Tell my body that. It\u2019s been reacting since she touched me with those feminine fingertips that totally betray her football-tough-girl image.</p><p>She holds out another cracker. I\u2019m tempted to take it, but I don\u2019t want those fingertips anywhere near my lips again. Her rule of no kissing or touching is cemented into my brain.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSuit yourself.\u201d She opens her mouth wide and squirts cheese directly into her mouth.</p><p>Keeping Ashtyn at a distance is what I need to do, even though I sense an undercurrent of something I can\u2019t put my finger on . . . and don\u2019t really want to. No kissing or touching. I glance over at Ashtyn. She\u2019s licking some cheese off her top lip and has no clue she\u2019s driving me insane.</p><p>She shrieks and braces both her hands on the dashboard. \u201cDerek, you\u2019re about to hit a squirrel!\u201d</p><p>Shit! I quickly swerve to avoid the thing, the tires screeching as the car jolts us sideways.</p><p>\u201cDid you hit it?\u201d she asks in a panic, looking in the rearview mirror.</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She shakes her finger at me, the same one that was on my lips a few minutes ago. \u201cPay attention to the road. You could\u2019ve killed us.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not the one who tested the no-touching rule. I grab the can and toss it in the back. There, now I won\u2019t be distracted.</p><p>She lets out a frustrated cry. \u201cWhat was that for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I can concentrate on the road.\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head in confusion, but if she thinks I\u2019m about to explain why I tossed the can of cheese in the back, she\u2019ll be waiting forever. Some things need to be left unsaid. With nothing to put on her crackers, she shoves the rest in her backpack, which I\u2019ve got no doubt is filled with more crap.</p> <p>I stop for gas and hand the keys to Ashtyn. She drives while I knock out in the passenger seat. I wish I was back in my dorm, where all I worried about was how I was gonna make it through the summer without being summoned into Crowe\u2019s office. When I was a freshman, I had it all planned out. I\u2019d go to college and play ball.</p><p>Everything changed after my mom died.</p><p>My brain reaches into the flood of memories locked up like a safe inside my head. I can still hear the familiar sound of my mom laughing in the kitchen with a stained towel around her head after she dyed the ends of her hair blue. It was my dad\u2019s favorite color and she wanted to be reminded of him every time she looked in the mirror. He was deployed and she was bored and lonely.</p><p>A few months later she got diagnosed with cancer and lost all that hair.</p><p>All those times my mom had go to her chemo treatments when I was at school sucked. When her hair started falling out, I found her crying in the bathroom as she looked into the mirror at the massive bald spots and clumps of hair in her brush.</p><p>Two days later she held up my dad\u2019s clippers and told me to finish the job. I shaved my own head right along with hers, but it didn\u2019t prevent her from tearing up the entire time. If I could have fought that cancer for her, I would have.</p><p>But there is no negotiating with cancer.</p><p>I took care of my mom, but it wasn\u2019t good enough. I couldn\u2019t save her and I wasn\u2019t there when she took her last breath. I know she would\u2019ve wanted me to be there. I was the only family member around, and she died alone because I was at football practice and got to the hospital too late.</p> <p>I should\u2019ve been there, but I wasn\u2019t.</p><p>There\u2019s a long stretch of silence as we drive for hours. After we stop for lunch, I take over the wheel and head for the campground. Ashtyn is leaning against the window, looking out at the farmhouses we\u2019re passing. Ashtyn points out a guy pushing a girl on a tire swing outside one of the houses. \u201cThat\u2019s romantic,\u201d she says, sighing loudly. \u201cDerek, have you ever had a girlfriend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>I haven\u2019t thought about Stephanie in a long time. We\u2019d gone to homecoming together sophomore year, and afterward she gave me her garter and her virginity. She said we\u2019d be together forever, and at the time I believed it. \u201cI moved to California and she lived in Tennessee. We tried to make the long-distance thing work, but that didn\u2019t last long.\u201d Forever ended up to be seven months.</p><p>\u201cWhen did you know it was over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I found out she was screwin\u2019 my best friend.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 32</p><p>Ashtyn</p><p>\u201cAshtyn, wake up. We\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not really awake, and just want to go back to sleep. That\u2019s not going to happen, because Derek pats me soundly on the shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m up,\u201d I say groggily.</p><p>He keeps patting me on the shoulder until I sit up and look out the window. In front of us is a big sign that reads:</p><p>HAPPY CAMPER CAMPGROUND</p><p>Where nature nurtures you!</p><p>Oh, goodie. Nature. Should I mention that I\u2019m not fond of spiders, and just hearing the sound of crickets creeps me out? \u201cUmm . . . why don\u2019t we ditch the camping idea and go to a hotel? Between your gambling money and my meager savings, I\u2019m sure we can scrape up enough to stay at a decent place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGambling money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t act all innocent. Monika found a bunch of money stashed in your boot and poker chips in your suitcase.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo that makes me a gambler?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, Sugar Pie. Don\u2019t be a diva and be quick to judge other people.\u201d He steps out of the car and heads toward a sign that reads REGISTRATION AND GENERAL STORE.</p><p>A guy at the front desk greets us with a crooked, toothy grin as he produces a site registration form. Soon we\u2019re assigned a small campsite with running water and electricity.</p><p>While Derek buys a bundle of wood and matches, I buy hot dogs and buns. In the end, I splurge and buy stuff to make s\u2019mores. As long as I\u2019m stuck here, I might as well make the best of it.</p><p>Outside, Derek leans against the car while checking the map for our campsite location. He has no clue that two girls sitting on top of the picnic bench a few feet away are staring at him like he\u2019s some sort of conquest.</p><p>He peeks into my bag. \u201cWhat\u2019d you buy for dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re thinking I got organic turkey burgers or flax seeds, you\u2019ve got another thing coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about apple cider vinegar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA detox.\u201d</p><p>I look him up and down. \u201cYou don\u2019t need a detox, Derek. You need hot dogs.\u201d</p><p>His response is a laugh. \u201cLet\u2019s pitch the tent and make a fire so I can fill up with those nitrates. Yum.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re seriously getting on my nerves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the point, Sugar Pie.\u201d Derek drives down the winding gravel road until we reach campsite number 431. It\u2019s got a few trees, but mostly it\u2019s an open, flat grassy area. \u201cHome sweet home!\u201d he announces.</p><p>A couple of our neighbors are playing football, a family is cooking over a fire, and a few girls are sunbathing in bikinis.</p><p>Derek practically jumps out of the car and pulls our tent out of the back.</p><p>I read the description on the side of the box. \u201cThis is for three people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. We\u2019re two people, with a tent for three. We\u2019ll have plenty of room to stretch out.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not convinced. \u201cThis looks small, Derek. I don\u2019t think my blow-up bed will fit very well in this thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlow-up bed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. I need to be comfortable.\u201d</p><p>Being around guys in close quarters is second nature to me. I\u2019ve had to sleep on the bus with the guys when we\u2019ve traveled long distances for games, and I\u2019ve been in the locker room when most of them were half-dressed. But this is different. I have to be in a tent with a boy I have a crush on who I don\u2019t want to have a crush on.</p><p>Derek pulls out the tent and spreads it on the ground.</p><p>\u201cNeed help?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cNope. I got it.\u201d</p><p>I sit on a tree stump and watch Derek expertly pitch the tent. It\u2019s hot, even though the sun is going down. He takes off his shirt and wipes sweat from his face with it. When he shoves part of his shirt into the waistband of his jeans, his deep blue eyes meet mine and I feel butterflies in my stomach.</p><p>I look away, not wanting him to know I was admiring his naked, bronzed chest and perfect physique. I feel guilty for looking.</p><p>The domed tent is green with a purple racing stripe going down the side like a sports car. Most sports cars are bigger than our tent. Most closets are bigger than our tent. All the tents around us are bigger. When Derek refuses to put the blow-up bed I brought in the tent, I lug it in there and inflate it myself. It takes up most of the space, but at least I\u2019ll be comfortable.</p><p>In the woods, I gather little sticks to kindle the fire as Derek places firewood in the pit. One of the guys in the campsite next to ours tosses a football near me. On instinct, I drop the sticks and catch the ball.</p><p>\u201cWhoa,\u201d a boy with curly blond hair says. \u201cNice catch.\u201d</p><p>I throw it back in a perfect spiral. Curly\u2019s friend, who\u2019s got a tattoo of a skull on his forearm, says, \u201cGood throw. What\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAshtyn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Ben. Where you from, Ashtyn?\u201d the guy with the tattoo asks.</p><p>\u201cChicago.\u201d</p><p>Curly waves me over. \u201cWant to hang with us?\u201d</p><p>Derek looks ready to intervene, as if I need some hero to rescue me if I get myself into trouble. I don\u2019t need his help. These are just a few guys having fun. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll meet up with you guys later.\u201d</p><p>When I come back to our site, Derek shakes his head.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cYou fell for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFell for what?\u201d</p><p>He nods in the direction of Ben and his friends. \u201cThose guys were checkin\u2019 you out way before that ball was thrown your way, Ashtyn. It wasn\u2019t an accident.\u201d</p><p>I arrange the sticks in the fire pit along with the wood Derek bought. \u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>He kneels down and starts to light the kindling with a lighter. \u201cSo I\u2019m gettin\u2019 paid to drive you, not to babysit you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need a babysitter. I don\u2019t need anyone.\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head and sits back on his heels. \u201cThat\u2019s what you think.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 33</p><p>Derek</p><p>Ashtyn really got pissed at my babysitting comment, like it was some huge insult. Now she won\u2019t talk to me. After we ate the hot dogs, she climbed into the tent and hasn\u2019t peeked her head out since. Will she still ignore me when we have to sleep next to each other?</p><p>\u201cCan we join you?\u201d comes a female voice from the campsite next to ours. \u201cOur fire went out and we\u2019re out of wood.\u201d</p><p>Three girls, all wearing St. Louis Cardinals T-shirts and bikini bottoms, walk up to me. They\u2019ve all got super long straight hair. One has a stripe of her hair dyed pink.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d I help bring their chairs around our fire. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The girls introduce themselves and we start talking. Ashtyn steps out of the tent. She doesn\u2019t talk much until the guys who\u2019d been playing ball earlier gather around our campfire. They bring a cooler full of beer. Before long, we\u2019re hosting an all-out bash with music blaring from speakers in someone\u2019s van.</p><p>Ashtyn\u2019s suddenly chatting it up with a bunch of the guys. She\u2019s got all their attention as she relays some story about playing football in the middle of a downpour last season. Ashtyn has power over guys . . . power that has nothing to do with being a football player. She doesn\u2019t flip her hair back or giggle or stick out her breasts to get their attention like normal girls. She\u2019s just . . . Ashtyn.</p><p>\u201cIs Ashtyn your girlfriend?\u201d a girl who introduced herself as Carrie asks.</p><p>I glance across the fire at the girl who drives me nuts, then tell myself to look away and stop caring about what she does.</p> <p>\u201cNope, Ashtyn\u2019s not my girlfriend.\u201d I glance around like I\u2019m about to tell Carrie something super secretive. \u201cShe\u2019s actually royalty from Fregolia, a small country in Europe. She wanted to know what it was like to live with the locals in America, so she\u2019s here undercover. I\u2019m her bodyguard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoh.\u201d Carrie glances at my biceps appreciatively, then licks her lips. She leans closer. \u201cYou have the most amazing eyes. Where are you from?\u201d</p><p>I bet my left nut that if I say Fregolia, she might very well believe me. \u201cThe answer\u2019s kinda complicated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m from a lot of places.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOoh, mysterious.\u201d She straightens, seemingly excited to learn about all the places I\u2019ve lived. \u201cLet me guess, then. You must have gotten that sexy drawl from somewhere.\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cAlabama. Tennessee. Texas.\u201d</p><p>Carrie touches my bicep and cries out, \u201cOh, my God! You\u2019re from Texas? What a coincidence! I love Texasians!\u201d</p><p>Chapter 34</p><p>Ashtyn</p><p>After talking and laughing with the guys from the other campsite until my voice is raw, I\u2019m suddenly exhausted. They ask me to play strip poker at their site. I\u2019m not about to play strip poker with anyone, let alone a bunch of guys I just met. I don\u2019t tell them that Derek plays poker, because I don\u2019t want him to play strip poker or any kind of stripping game with those girls he met tonight.</p> <p>Derek is talking to some girl by the campfire. He\u2019s been talking to her all night. She\u2019s flirting, giggling, and touching his arm. Derek is definitely interested; I can tell by the way he\u2019s focusing all his attention on her.</p><p>I gather my hockey jersey and toiletries, then walk down the little pathway to take a shower and get ready for bed. I pass Derek and the giggler on the way back to our tent, ignoring them as I unzip the entrance and crawl inside.</p><p>I\u2019m lying on the mattress and hear more giggles. And Derek\u2019s laughter. Ugh, why do I care if Derek wants to hook up with someone else? Because the truth is that I want to be with him. I find myself craving it. I squeeze my eyes shut and try to wipe out the image of Derek and the girl outside. I wish that girl was me.</p><p>What am I thinking? I don\u2019t want a guy who cringes at the thought of having a real relationship instead of a one-night stand. I don\u2019t want a gambler or womanizer. Just like I told him before dinner, I don\u2019t want or need anyone.</p><p>I try to sleep, but I can\u2019t. As if hearing their low whispers isn\u2019t bad enough, through the nylon I see their shadows. Her giggles grate on my nerves because they\u2019re so fake.</p><p>I turn over, put my earbuds in, and listen to music. The light from my iPod gives the tent a dim glow. I take a deep, calming breath . . . but out of the corner of my eye I catch sight of something crawling on the tent\u2014a big spider is right next to my head!</p><p>I scramble to get away from the creepy thing.</p><p>Is it on me?</p> <p>Oh, no. I don\u2019t like creepy, crawly spiders with fangs and a bunch of legs and gross, sticky webs. They freak me out.</p><p>It moves closer.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t come near me!\u201d I cry out, then whimper for help.</p><p>Within seconds, the front of the tent zips open and Derek appears. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d he asks, his voice full of concern.</p><p>I point to the offending creature. \u201cThere it is!\u201d I moan when it climbs to the top of the tent. \u201cEwww. Get it away. Smash it. Kill it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re brutal. It\u2019s a spider, Ashtyn. Not a scorpion.\u201d</p><p>He captures it, then sets it free outside.</p><p>\u201cMake sure you put it far away,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>He appears again. \u201cIt\u2019s gone. You\u2019re a tough football player. Surely you can handle a little spider.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurely being a football player has nothing to do with a fear of those eight-legged creepy crawlers, Derek. And that thing wasn\u2019t little. I saw its fangs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, right.\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cWhat did you think, that there\u2019d be no spiders at a campground? We\u2019re in the middle of nature.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t expect one to be inside my tent,\u201d I tell him. \u201cI read on the Internet that it\u2019s not uncommon for a person to eat a spider while they\u2019re sleeping. I couldn\u2019t go to sleep thinking that thing was about to crawl on my face and stick its fangs into me. This is my space.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s gone, so you\u2019re fine now. I\u2019m surprised we haven\u2019t heard from the Happy Camper police. It\u2019s quiet hours after ten, you know.\u201d He grabs his toiletries from his duffel. \u201cYour bed is takin\u2019 up eighty percent of the tent. Where do you suppose I\u2019m gonna sleep?\u201d</p><p>I point to a sliver of space, big enough if he doesn\u2019t move much. \u201cRight there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kiddin\u2019 me, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head. \u201cWe\u2019ll figure it out when I get back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about that ugly girl you were talking to?\u201d I ask, trying to hide any trace of jealousy in my voice. \u201cIsn\u2019t she still out there waiting for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wasn\u2019t ugly. And no, she\u2019s not waitin\u2019 for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you see her pink hair? I mean, seriously. It\u2019s painfully obvious she\u2019s begging for attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s hot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, what do you know? I think bacteria from those algae smoothies have invaded your brain.\u201d</p><p>He turns to me. \u201cYou jealous I was talkin\u2019 to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not jealous. I\u2019m just concerned, but I won\u2019t look out for you anymore if you don\u2019t want me to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to look out for yourself, Ashtyn. Not me.\u201d</p><p>Derek leaves to wash up. My stomach has butterflies knowing that he\u2019ll be sleeping in the tent with me. I don\u2019t want to admit that I want him to want me. But I do. I want him to say that the girl he was talking to tonight was boring and stupid and . . . not me.</p><p>He\u2019s back. The blow-up bed moves as he sits on it. I roll toward the middle . . . toward him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think you\u2019re sleeping on my bed,\u201d I mumble, scootching back to the edge of the bed and hoping he doesn\u2019t sense that I\u2019m totally aware of the electricity between us. If he\u2019s feeling it, too, he\u2019s masking it.</p><p>\u201cListen, Sugar Pie, you didn\u2019t leave me any room. We\u2019re sharin\u2019 a bed. You don\u2019t like it,\u201d he says in an annoyed tone, \u201cI have a pocketknife that I\u2019ll be happy to plunge into the mattress.\u201d</p><p>I sit up. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t dare.\u201d</p><p>He reaches into his bag and holds up the knife. \u201cTry me.\u201d</p><p>Unfortunately, I don\u2019t think Derek is the kind of guy to make empty threats. \u201cFine. You can sleep in the bed, but make sure you stay on your side. Remember our no-touching rule.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust move over.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s completely dark. And it\u2019s silent except for our breathing.</p><p>My back is to Derek. I hear him slide his jeans off before he lies down next to me. It\u2019s strangely intimate with just the two of us alone in the tent. Has he slept all night with a girl before? Did he sleep with that girlfriend from Tennessee who cheated on him?</p><p>There\u2019s hardly enough room for both of us on the bed. I keep my body totally straight so we don\u2019t accidentally touch our legs or hands or arms or . . . anything. I have nothing to worry about. While Derek might want to be with me physically because he\u2019s a male, he doesn\u2019t have any desire to hold me and tell me everything in my life will turn out okay.</p><p>That\u2019s what I want from a guy.</p><p>That\u2019s what I need from a guy.</p><p>Suddenly it\u2019s super silent in the tent. Even the crickets are quiet. I\u2019m restless. Silence to me is as annoying as nails on a chalk-board, because when it\u2019s too quiet my mind goes in overdrive. When my mom and Brandi left all those years ago, our house was too silent. All I did was think about what they were doing, why they left, and how awfully lonely I\u2019d become. I filled that void with music, the pounding kind that doesn\u2019t let you think.</p><p>Derek is listening to music with his headphones on. It\u2019s so quiet I can hear the songs. Old music from the \u201950s and \u201960s softly fills the tent. The songs soothe me. I drift off trying not to think about Derek saving me from the spider. Or sleeping next to me. I remind myself that he\u2019s attracted to girls like the one with the pink-striped hair\u2014someone who knows she\u2019ll never see him again.</p><p>He\u2019d been my hero tonight without realizing it. He\u2019s being my hero now, by driving me to Texas and staying with me tonight instead of going off and hooking up with that girl.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I mumble as I drift off, knowing he can\u2019t hear me with his headphones on. It\u2019s nice knowing that at least for tonight I\u2019m protected . . . Derek is here to make sure I\u2019m not attacked by spiders . . . or hounded by thoughts of being abandoned.</p><p>I\u2019m dreaming about Alaska. All I know is that I\u2019m cold and I can\u2019t get warm. I\u2019m stuck in the middle of an iceberg and can\u2019t get loose. I\u2019d do anything to stop shaking. The wind is as cold as a snowstorm. Somehow I magically get off the iceberg. Now I\u2019m walking in the snow, naked, about to freeze to death.</p><p>I\u2019m half-asleep as I turn to find a more comfortable position, barely aware that I\u2019m not in Alaska but sleeping in a tent. I\u2019m cold . . . the temperature has dropped and I\u2019m shaking. My hand rests on something warm. An island of some sort. I move closer to the warmth, cuddling into it.</p><p>\u201cAshtyn, what\u2019re you doin\u2019?\u201d a deep, masculine voice says.</p><p>Derek. I don\u2019t open my eyes, but I know it\u2019s him. His drawl is unique and undeniable, like warm hot chocolate. I want him to be my protector, just for tonight. If he leaves me, I\u2019ll be all alone.</p><p>I don\u2019t want to be cold and alone. Not tonight.</p><p>In my sleepy state I tell myself I\u2019ll do anything to keep him here with me.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t leave me,\u201d I mumble into his chest as I shiver uncontrollably.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d His arms wrap around me and I feel safe . . . away from the iceberg in my dream and the loneliness in my heart and the pain of losing everyone I ever loved. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter 35</p><p>Derek</p><p>I wake up with a hard-on. And my arm around Ashtyn. We\u2019re spooning like a married couple and her long hair is in my face. The flowery smell of her perfume reminds me that while Ashtyn talks tough and is a football player, she\u2019s 100 percent female. I did my best to stay on my side of the bed, but she kept moving closer. And closer. Then she told me she was cold and asked me to hold her, so I did.</p><p>That was my first mistake.</p> <p>I quickly take my arm off her and manage to get some space between us. I need to cool off. She was half-asleep when she asked me to hold her, so hopefully she won\u2019t remember. I\u2019m not about to play her temporary boyfriend until we get to Texas.</p><p>Pink-haired Carrie is my type. She pouted after I turned her down when she\u2019d asked if I wanted to spend the night in her tent. I\u2019d told her I had a job to do as Her Highness\u2019s bodyguard.</p><p>Carrie was looking for a good time.</p><p>Ashtyn is looking for someone who won\u2019t abandon her.</p><p>When she turned to me, was it just because I was a warm body? Or was it because it was me? Doesn\u2019t matter. I unzip the tent and go make a fire. How did I get here? It\u2019s because of that damn pig prank. Fucking pigs are the reason I\u2019m here and not in my dorm room at Regents.</p> <p>This trip is only a few days. I can do anything for a couple of days, even try to stay as far away from Ashtyn as possible. I hear movement in the tent before she peeks her head out.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d I point to a Pop-Tarts box on the hood of my car, but I don\u2019t make eye contact with her. Instead, I stare into the flames of the fire I just built. \u201cI got you some breakfast.\u201d</p><p>She opens the box. \u201cThanks,\u201d she mumbles as she takes a bite.</p><p>I lean forward on my elbows and wonder what I\u2019m gonna say to her. \u201cWe should pack up and head out soon,\u201d I say stoically. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of drivin\u2019 to do.\u201d</p><p>We spend the next twenty minutes packing up. She doesn\u2019t look my way when we pull out of the campground and head to our next destination.</p> <p>\u201cWant to talk about last night?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cThe part where you were flirtin\u2019 with those guys, or the part when you asked me to hold you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was not flirting with those guys. We were talking football.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s right. You only like guys who play football.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d When I don\u2019t answer, she says, \u201cMaybe we should start with the fact that you were getting all chummy with that girl with the pink hair. She just wanted to hook up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what makes it all the better. No emotional involvement. No strings attached. That\u2019s what I call a perfect relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I call skanky.\u201d She curls her upper lip in disgust. \u201cI feel sorry for your future wife. She\u2019s destined to be a very lonely woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I feel sorry for your future husband, who\u2019s destined to disappoint you and your high expectations.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHigh expectations? My expectations aren\u2019t high.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Then don\u2019t expect me to be your heater every night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Ashtyn insists she needs to practice every day while we\u2019re on the road. The girl is dedicated, I\u2019ll give her that much. She searches for nearby parks on her phone, but nothing comes up, so I end up driving around looking for an open area.</p><p>We come upon a high school with a football field out back. \u201cWhat about there? It\u2019s better than a park because you can actually kick through real goalposts and not imaginary ones.\u201d</p><p>Ashtyn shakes her head. \u201cI can\u2019t practice there. That\u2019s private school property. Besides, there\u2019s a fence around it and it\u2019s locked.\u201d</p><p>I look at her sideways. \u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not thinking about breaking in,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I am.\u201d</p><p>She keeps protesting while I park in the lot next to the field. \u201cCome on,\u201d I say. \u201cIt\u2019s summer and nobody\u2019s here. Trust me, it\u2019s not a big deal. Nobody\u2019s gonna care.\u201d</p><p>I walk toward the gate. Ashtyn stays in the car for a few seconds, then follows after grabbing a football and ball holder from the backseat.</p><p>\u201cThis is a bad idea, Derek,\u201d she says in a panicked voice. \u201cI don\u2019t do illegal things. I can\u2019t do illegal things. If we get caught\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep your panties on, Sugar Pie. We\u2019re not gonna get caught.\u201d I examine the lock and know it won\u2019t take me long to get it open. At Regents my friend Sam and I spent weeks practicing how to jimmy locks so we could get into the cafeteria and snatch food from the refrigerators at night.</p><p>\u201cYou are a thug,\u201d Ashtyn says when the lock clicks open and I lead her onto the grassy field.</p><p>Thug or not, she\u2019s now got a place to practice.</p><p>I lean against the post and watch her set up. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you want me to show you how to hold the ball so I can kick it from a live person?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cNah,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019m good.\u201d</p><p>She shrugs, then kicks the ball effortlessly from the one yard line. It sails through the posts.</p><p>\u201cWant to get the ball for me after I kick it?\u201d she asks. \u201cSo I don\u2019t have to run after it after every kick? It\u2019ll go much faster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah,\u201d I say again. \u201cI\u2019m good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a lazy ass,\u201d she mumbles as she fetches the ball and sets it up, this time on the five yard line.</p><p>She spends over an hour setting up the ball, kicking it, then retrieving it. Each time she kicks, the ball sails through the posts. I see the concentration on her face as she takes a calming breath and calculates how far she\u2019s got to kick it before her foot touches the ball.</p><p>The girl is impressive.</p><p>After her practice, we\u2019re back on the road. She\u2019s leaning back with her eyes closed, nodding as she gets lost in the music through her earbuds, oblivious to everything else around her.</p><p>I drive to the next campground, a small private campground near Oklahoma City. There are only four campsites on the property, and two are vacant. Ashtyn is quiet as we set up our tent in our assigned spot before it gets dark and wash up in the bathrooms at the front of the property.</p><p>Our site is surrounded by trees. An old couple in a pop-up tent who introduced themselves as Irving and Sylvia are in the campsite next to us. We met the old couple on the way back from the bathrooms, while they were sitting next to their pop-up tent at their fold-out table.</p><p>It\u2019s still light as Ashtyn takes footballs out of the car and practices kicking again. She stretches first, and I find myself watching her as if she\u2019s the star of an exercise show and it\u2019s the most entertaining thing on television. She looks back at me. \u201cYou watching me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust . . . come here.\u201d</p><p>I walk over to her. She picks up one of the footballs by her feet and hands it to me. \u201cYou remember how to throw one?\u201d</p><p>Yeah. I look at the ball as if I\u2019ve never held one in my hand before. \u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t your dad throw a football around with you when you were a little kid, Derek?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was kind of busy protectin\u2019 our country,\u201d I say, although that\u2019s only half-true. He was busy protecting our country most of the time, but he did teach me how to throw a football. I must\u2019ve been three when he first taught me how to throw a football. By the time I was eight, I begged my parents to constantly play football with me so I could practice my perfect spiral. I never stopped throwing the ball after that, and would recruit anyone who was around to go to the field with me so I could practice.</p><p>I hand the football back to her, but she pushes it in my hands. \u201cAre you a righty or lefty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRighty.\u201d</p><p>She takes my fingers and places them on the ball, then proceeds to tell me how to throw it. \u201cThe key is to let it roll off your fingers. I swear it\u2019ll come back to you once you try it.\u201d</p><p>I pretend like this is the first time holding a football and try not to crack a smile when she gives overly detailed instructions.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re such an expert at throwin\u2019,\u201d I tell her, \u201cwhy aren\u2019t you the quarterback?\u201d</p><p>She laughs. \u201cI can\u2019t throw as far or as accurately as Landon.\u201d She shrugs. \u201cSome guys are just born to throw footballs. Landon is a natural.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure there\u2019s a slew of dudes who\u2019re better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen anyone, especially in our division. His dad played professionally.\u201d</p><p>The way Ashtyn talks about Landon\u2019s talent, you\u2019d think he was some superhuman quarterback. It almost makes me want to show off my skills. Almost.</p><p>She jogs away from me. \u201cOkay, throw it!\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s not easy for me to toss a football awkwardly, like I\u2019m rusty, but I manage to do it. The ball tumbles through the air, then bounces on the ground with a thud. It\u2019s not even close to the target.</p><p>\u201cThat was pathetic, Derek.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I was an average ball player.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry again,\u201d she says encouragingly. \u201cRemember to let the ball roll off your fingers as you throw it.\u201d</p><p>I throw it again, this time managing to get it within ten yards of her but still out of reach.</p><p>\u201cYou sure you were born in America? You sure don\u2019t throw a football like you were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot everyone can be as good as Landon, the \u2018God of All Quarterbacks,\u2019 I guess.\u201d</p><p>She tucks the balls under her arm. \u201cLesson over for today. And if you\u2019re jealous of Landon, there\u2019s no shame in admitting it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not jealous of him.\u201d With a little practice I bet I could outthrow him.</p><p>Ashtyn holds in a chuckle. \u201cYeah, right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you love about the game?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll explain it to you. To me it\u2019s more than a game.\u201d She touches her chest and says, \u201cWhen you love something as much as I love football, you just feel it inside. Did you ever love doing something so bad that it consumed you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA long time ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what football is to me. It\u2019s my passion, my life . . . my escape. When I play, I forget everything that sucks in my life. And when we win . . .\u201d She looks down, like she\u2019s embarrassed to admit what she\u2019s about to reveal. \u201cI know this is going to sound stupid, but when we win, I think miracles can happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiracles, huh?\u201d</p><p>She nods. \u201cI told you it was stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not stupid. I guess havin\u2019 hope is better than givin\u2019 up and thinking life will suck forever.\u201d</p><p>We start walking back to our campsite when Sylvia waves us over. \u201cCome join us! We\u2019ve got plenty of food. Irv, go get them chairs.\u201d</p><p>Ashtyn and I walk to their small table while Irv does what he\u2019s told and Sylvia dishes out food.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t want to interrupt your dinner,\u201d Ashtyn says, although she\u2019s eyeing the chicken and rice as if it were a gourmet meal. She looks exhausted, but that chicken sure does bring a light to her eyes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThank you, ma\u2019am.\u201d I take a seat.</p><p>Sylvia does most of the talking while we eat. She tells us how she and Irv met when they were young and have four children. One is a doctor, one is a lawyer, and one is a pharmacist.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what the hell our son Jerry does,\u201d Irv says.</p><p>Sylvia taps Irv on the shoulder. \u201cDon\u2019t say \u2018hell\u2019 in front of these nice kids, Irv.\u201d Irv mumbles a quick apology before chowing down.</p> <p>Ashtyn and I are chowing down, too. The chicken is tender and the seasoning makes my mouth water. The rice tastes damn good, too. I haven\u2019t had a good home-cooked meal in forever. Ashtyn must feel the same way, because she\u2019s done with her chicken and is chowing down on the rice.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you two been dating?\u201d Sylvia asks.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not datin\u2019,\u201d I answer.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>Ashtyn looks up from her plate. \u201cBecause he only likes stupid girls who want one-night stands.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd she only likes jocks who play football,\u201d I say, challenging her.</p><p>Sylvia tilts her head as if she\u2019s scrutinizing my choice of girls while Irv looks at me appreciatively.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to let the girl of your dreams get away,\u201d Sylvia tells me. \u201cTell him why, Irv.\u201d Irv is busy eating and doesn\u2019t seem to want to stop. \u201cIrv!\u201d</p><p>He finally puts his fork down. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have your hearing aids on?\u201d Sylvia asks him. After he nods, she repeats in a louder tone, \u201cTell Derek here why he shouldn\u2019t let the girl of his dreams get away!\u201d</p><p>Irving brings Sylvia\u2019s hand to his lips, kissing it softly. \u201cWhen I saw Sylvia for the first time, I was hired to paint her house. She had a boyfriend who she was expected to marry, but I knew from the moment I laid eyes on her that she was the one. She probably wasn\u2019t supposed to talk to the help, but she\u2019d watch me paint and chat with me while I worked. I\u2019d fallen madly in love with the girl and knew she was the girl of my dreams.\u201d He stops to look into Sylvia\u2019s eyes longingly. \u201cSo when it was time to paint Sylvia\u2019s room, I painted MARRY ME on her wall.\u201d He laughs. \u201cShe wrote her answer on the wall so I\u2019d find it the next day.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Ashtyn asks, completely into the story as if it\u2019s a fairy tale.</p><p>\u201cObviously she said yes, because they\u2019re married,\u201d I tell her.</p><p>\u201cActually, Irving never saw what I\u2019d written because my parents found out what he\u2019d done and fired him,\u201d Sylvia says. \u201cThey didn\u2019t want me marrying a painter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I never gave up. I came to her house every day, asking for her hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEventually my parents gave in.\u201d Sylvia pats Irving\u2019s hand. \u201cAnd we were married six months later. That was sixty years ago.\u201d</p><p>Ashtyn sits back and sighs. \u201cThat\u2019s a wonderful story. So romantic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why you don\u2019t let the girl of your dreams get away, Derek.\u201d Sylvia wags her finger at me.</p><p>I think about what Ashtyn would look like sixty years from now sitting across the table from me. I bet she\u2019d still have that same sparkle in her eyes and those kissable lips. She\u2019d be grateful someone finally stuck by her all those years when everyone else failed her.</p> <p>But I can\u2019t be that guy.</p><p>I might not make it past thirty-five, the age my mom was when she died. Right now, as I look across the table at the girl who could very well be the girl of my dreams, I know I won\u2019t marry her. I\u2019m going to let someone else be her Irving, someone who\u2019ll be able to sit across from her sixty years from now and look into her eyes as if his would have been a horrible existence if not for her.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, Ashtyn here is bossy and controlling.\u201d My food threatens to come up as I add, \u201cSince I don\u2019t like bossy and controlling girls, she ain\u2019t the girl of my dreams.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDerek is actually the most annoying boy I\u2019ve ever met,\u201d Ashtyn chimes in with a fake smile. \u201cSo if he painted MARRY ME on my wall, I\u2019d put a circle around it and slash a line right through it.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 36</p><p>Ashtyn</p><p>I\u2019m not going to let Derek think his comments weigh heavily on my mind or my heart. Back at our campsite, I announce that I\u2019m tired and want to go to bed.</p><p>Tonight I won\u2019t freeze my ass off, because I put on two pairs of socks, two pairs of sweats, and two jerseys. I must look like a puffed-up marshmallow, but I don\u2019t care. I don\u2019t want to be weak in the middle of the night and ask him to hold me.</p><p>The entire time Irving was telling his story, I thought about the boy of my dreams. I imagined Derek looking at me across a dinner table sixty years from now.</p><p>But Derek doesn\u2019t want to be my boyfriend. He says he couldn\u2019t be with me because I\u2019m controlling and bossy. But could I be someone else for him? If I change, will he want to love me?</p><p>The problem is that last night, knowing he was near and wouldn\u2019t let go of me, made me feel something I haven\u2019t felt in a long time. When he told me he wouldn\u2019t leave me, I believed him. I found myself wanting to fall in love with him.</p><p>Truth is, I think I already have.</p><p>It hurts, because I have to either give up on ever having my feelings reciprocated or become the kind of girl Derek wants. Ugh, I don\u2019t know what to do.</p><p>I hear wood crackling and leaves crunching underneath his footsteps as I lie in the tent. A few minutes later Derek peeks inside.</p><p>\u201cYou sure you don\u2019t want to sit outside for a bit?\u201d he asks in that deep voice that penetrates the cool night air. \u201cIt\u2019s warm by the fire.\u201d</p><p>If I look at him, my heart will skip a beat and I might be tempted to tell him how I feel. I can\u2019t do that. \u201cI\u2019m fine. Just go to the fire and leave me alone,\u201d I bark, trying to push him away so I can be alone in my misery. I\u2019m so conflicted.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019re you wearin\u2019?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cPractically everything in my entire duffel.\u201d I fluff my pillow and turn away from him. \u201cI won\u2019t be cold tonight, so you don\u2019t have to worry. You can rest easy knowing I won\u2019t ask you to keep me warm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t what?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a long silence. \u201cForget it,\u201d he finally says. \u201cGood night, Ashtyn. See you in the mornin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Tears form in my eyes. This isn\u2019t the way it\u2019s supposed to be when you fall in love. As controlling as he says I am, I wish I could control the way he feels about me. But I can\u2019t. I know there\u2019s more between us than just a game, but how do I make him see it?</p><p>I wish I could control my emotions as I squeeze my eyes shut and will them to stay dry. But I can\u2019t. Silent tears start streaming down my face and fall onto my pillow.</p><p>One-sided love sucks.</p><p>Chapter 37</p><p>Derek</p><p>I\u2019m sitting alone in front of the fire. Irving walks up, holding a can of beer.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got a nice fire going there,\u201d he says.</p><p>I gesture to Ashtyn\u2019s empty chair. \u201cWant to join me? Ashtyn went to sleep a while ago and I could use some company.\u201d</p><p>He settles into the chair and takes a swig of beer. \u201cAshtyn seems like a nice girl. Spunky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s trouble. For me, at least.\u201d I toss a stick into the fire. \u201cMy dad married her sister, so we\u2019re kind of stuck together . . . at least for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could do a lot worse than being stuck with a pretty girl on a road trip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe drives me nuts.\u201d</p><p>Irving chuckles as if sincerely amused. \u201cEvery worthwhile girl drives a man nuts, Derek. Just think what a boring world it would be without girls who keep us on our toes. My Sylvia is a feisty ol\u2019 gal, but we complement each other. For richer or poorer, in sickness and in health . . . we\u2019ve been through it all, which just made us stronger.\u201d</p><p>I think about all the shit that\u2019s happened in the short time I\u2019ve known Ashtyn. \u201cWe made a rule that we\u2019re not supposed to, you know . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you agree to it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell . . . yeah.\u201d</p><p>He shrugs. \u201cSeems to me that might\u2019ve been your first mistake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe it was.\u201d And maybe it was an excuse to stay far away from her so I wouldn\u2019t have to deal with the consequences.</p><p>We spend the next twenty minutes staring into the fire. Irving was in the military, so I tell him that my dad is deployed. He tells me that he\u2019s an Army veteran. When I ask if it was hard for Sylvia when he was in the military, he said it was, but they kept in touch with letters and the rare phone call. When he was deployed, you couldn\u2019t communicate through e-mail or Skype.</p><p>He finishes his beer and stretches his legs out. \u201cWell, I\u2019m gonna get some shut-eye. Have a nice evening.\u201d He gestures to our tent. \u201cKeep an eye on her, because if you don\u2019t, I\u2019ll bet you some young buck is gonna snatch her up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>When he leaves, I stay in front of the fire. Do I sleep next to Ashtyn? Fuck, I\u2019m so aware of her I can\u2019t go in there and be next to her.</p><p>I sit in the chair by the fire, cross my arms on my chest, and close my eyes. It\u2019ll probably be the most uncomfortable night I\u2019ve ever had, but that\u2019s okay. Today I\u2019m not doing anything to shake up my life.</p><p>But tomorrow . . . well, tomorrow\u2019s another day.</p><p>Chapter 38</p><p>Ashtyn</p><p>I wake up in the middle of the night, burning up and drenched in sweat. Derek isn\u2019t in the tent. I strip off one of the jerseys and kick off my sweatpants and socks, then go back to sleep. A little later I wake up to the sound of rain tapping on the tent. Derek still isn\u2019t here and it doesn\u2019t look like he\u2019s been here all night. I figure he went to the bathroom, but after fifteen minutes there\u2019s still no sign of him. Worry settles in my chest.</p><p>What if he got attacked by a bear?</p><p>Or slipped in the mud on the way to the bathroom and hit his head on a rock?</p><p>Rain is coming down steadily as I grab a flashlight from my bag and walk outside. Derek\u2019s sitting with his arms crossed on his chest and a baseball cap perched on his head.</p><p>\u201cAre you crazy? It\u2019s pouring,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why aren\u2019t you in the tent, where it\u2019s dry and warm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I was too tempted to break our no-touching-or-kissing rule.\u201d He looks me up and down. \u201cBein\u2019 here with you . . . you\u2019ve really got under my skin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to break the rule?\u201d</p><p>He nods slowly. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m tryin\u2019 to push you away when all I want to do is hold you. I know you say you don\u2019t want a hero, but damn I\u2019d like to be that guy who\u2019ll save you from spiders and whatever and whoever else hurts you.\u201d</p><p>His words seep deep into the core of my heart. With our eyes locked, I straddle him on the chair. \u201cI want to break the rule, too.\u201d</p><p>My heart pounds rapidly and I grab his shoulders so he can steady me. I\u2019m dizzy with wanting him to love me as much as I love him. He\u2019s soaking wet and now I\u2019m soaking and rain falls on us and around us. I don\u2019t feel hot or cold . . . I\u2019m too caught up in being with Derek, here in the dark in the middle of the night. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019ve dropped the flashlight, so I can\u2019t see much. But I can feel. I can feel Derek\u2019s strong thighs beneath mine and his large hands circling my waist. I want to feel more, much more. The road to this moment was full of arguments and misunderstandings, but now we\u2019re in perfect sync.</p><p>He cups the back of my head and urges me to kiss him. When our lips meet, my insides get all tingly. He places little teasing kisses across my lips until I moan and want more . . . I want him to let go and stop trying to protect me from himself.</p><p>I open my mouth for a more intimate kiss in an attempt to make him lose control. Our wet lips and tongues tangle around each other\u2019s.</p><p>I break the kiss and lean back. \u201cI don\u2019t want to pretend I don\u2019t want this, Derek. Not tonight.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMe neither,\u201d he admits.</p><p>Ever since I touched his muscular chest, I\u2019ve wanted to run my hands over it again and again until I\u2019ve memorized each ripple. I slide his shirt over his head and lightly brush my fingertips over his shoulders, then move down and feel the rapid rhythm of his heart beating against my palm. I trace the muscles on his stomach, and lightly rub his nipples until I hear him groan.</p><p>I like hearing his voice change. It means I\u2019ve broken through that macho facade and his true emotions are exposed.</p><p>Through the darkness, I feel his eyes on me. He lifts my jersey over my head. I close my eyes as I let the rain drip on me and enjoy the sensation of Derek gently and slowly tracing the droplets traveling across my body with his fingertips. He replaces his fingers with his tongue. I start moving against him because it feels amazing and I don\u2019t want to stop. I want to keep going, to show Derek what it means to have a connection that\u2019ll last more than one night.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful, you know that?\u201d he whispers.</p> <p>I look away. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine a more beautiful girl,\u201d he says, then adds, \u201cEven if you are controllin\u2019 and bossy.\u201d</p><p>I lick the crook of his neck and he moans. \u201cMaybe you\u2019ll learn to like controlling and bossy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re right.\u201d He laces my hand through his, but stills as my charm bracelet brushes his wrist. He feels for the clasp and unhooks it, then tosses it across the campsite. It hits the ground with a clatter.</p><p>\u201cThat was expensive. London bought it for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019ll buy you a new one.\u201d He laces his fingers through mine again.</p> <p>We kiss for what seems like forever. When he licks the rain off my neck, I swear my body is on fire. I need something to put out the flame. I need Derek to touch me, to hold me.</p><p>I look in his eyes and without saying a word he knows what I\u2019m asking. Love me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re cold,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are you shivering?\u201d</p><p>I wrap my arms around his neck and hug him tight. He takes me into his arms and carries me to the tent. The tent is cold, too, but at least it\u2019s dry. He kicks off his wet jeans. Soon we\u2019re both under the covers completely naked, skin to skin. His strong, capable arms wrap around me. My heart stops racing and the heat of his body makes me stop shivering.</p><p>He wipes the wet hair away from my eyes with slow, gentle fingers. \u201cI can\u2019t promise you everythin\u2019 you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust promise me tonight, Derek.\u201d</p> <p>Chapter 39</p><p>Derek</p><p>Ashtyn has no clue the effect she has on me. When I opened my eyes and saw her standing in front of me in the rain, I thought I was dreaming. Now she\u2019s lying next to me, her body pressed against mine, and I\u2019m defenseless. I want to make love to her. I want to tell her about my past, that football used to be my life. It defined who I was and who I wanted to be. I want to make this night last forever.</p><p>But it can\u2019t.</p><p>Dammit, I know I\u2019m getting in too deep. I should run away from this, from her, but that\u2019s not about to happen. Our connection is too powerful and impossible to ignore. She traces my jaw and lips, looking at me as if I\u2019m the answer to everything. I\u2019m not, and I shouldn\u2019t pretend I am.</p><p>\u201cStop analyzing this,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d There\u2019s too much that\u2019s unsaid between us.</p><p>\u201cI know how much you hurt inside,\u201d she tells me. \u201cI see it in your face, your eyes.\u201d She places her hand over my heart. \u201cRight now I see the real you, Derek. The one you try to hide.\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t know the half of it. Her words sink in. I\u2019ve never felt this way, but then again, I\u2019ve never been with a girl like Ashtyn.</p><p>I kiss her, the soft fullness of her lips sending bolts of electricity throughout my entire body. Her leg wraps around me and I trace the contour of her hip with the tips of my fingers. When she purrs at my touch and arches her body against mine, I feel myself losing control.</p><p>\u201cYou make me feel so amazing,\u201d she says in a breathless whisper against my chest. Her words seep into my heart.</p><p>Shit, this isn\u2019t the way it\u2019s supposed to go. I\u2019m supposed to keep my emotions in check and only hook up with girls who want a good time, not girls who are desperate to make this something more than it could ever be.</p><p>But she\u2019s not asking for forever or asking for me to play football again, two things I\u2019d never be able to promise. She\u2019s asking me to be with her tonight, nothing more. I need to just take what she\u2019s offering. I grasp her wrist and bring it to my lips, kissing it gently and feeling her pulse pounding against her warm, soft skin.</p><p>I trace the contours of her body with my fingers and follow with my tongue. Her heart races, matching mine, as she moans and pulls me closer with urgency. Ashtyn is amazing and hot and sexy. My fingers play with her body and I kiss her sweet lips as she moves against my hand.</p><p>I place her hand on me and she brings my body to a new, heightened frenzy. Now I\u2019m the one moaning. I feel like I\u2019m about to burst.</p><p>\u201cYou ready to do this?\u201d she asks me.</p><p>\u201cHell, yeah. You?\u201d</p><p>She nods. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>I tell myself to calm down. This is just sex with a girl. There are no commitments or expectations beyond tonight, so why is my body reacting like this\u2019ll change the course of my life forever? That\u2019s insane. We\u2019ll have fun tonight and move on tomorrow.</p><p>She leans down and kisses me tenderly as her hair falls like a curtain around us. The rain taps on the tent and thunder barks in the distance.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re really gonna do this,\u201d she whispers against my lips. Something suspiciously like a teardrop falls on my chest. It\u2019s dark and I can\u2019t see much, but my sense of touch is super alert.</p><p>\u201cAre you cryin\u2019?\u201d I ask.</p><p>She doesn\u2019t answer.</p><p>I swipe my thumb against her cheek. More tears.</p><p>Damn. I can\u2019t do this.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t gonna work, Ashtyn.\u201d I sit up and run a hand through my hair in frustration. I was an idiot to think we could hook up for one night and forget it happened in the morning. She might pretend she can be that girl, but she\u2019s not. \u201cI\u2019m fixin\u2019 to leave in January and move back to Cali when my dad gets back. I can\u2019t . . . I can\u2019t be that guy you want me to be.\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>\u201cAshtyn, say somethin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to say anything. Just leave me alone.\u201d She sits up and reaches into her duffel for dry clothes.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I say dumbly. Fuck. I want to say more, but what? I\u2019ll be there for her forever? I\u2019ll be the one she can always count on? It\u2019ll be bullshit, empty words she\u2019s heard before.</p><p>She turns her back to me and gets dressed. \u201cGo to sleep, Derek.\u201d</p><p>I lie back and sigh. When sunlight streams through the tent, Ashtyn is sleeping soundly with her back still to me.</p><p>Chapter 40</p><p>Ashtyn</p><p>When I wake up, Derek looks like he hasn\u2019t slept at all. His hair is mussed and he\u2019s sitting up and rubbing his eyes with his palms. I feel weird and awkward about last night. I went through every emotion, ending with sadness that he couldn\u2019t even pretend to love me for one night.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he says in a scratchy morning voice.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d I try to hold in my emotions before they overflow and give me away. Before he says anything else, I hold up a hand. \u201cDon\u2019t ask me if I want to talk about last night, because the answer is no. I never want to talk about it, so just do me a favor and keep whatever you want to say to yourself.\u201d</p><p>He nods and leaves the tent without answering.</p><p>I wanted to tell him so many times last night how I feel about him. The words almost spilled from my lips outside in the rain, and then in the tent. I teared up because I knew if I told him the truth, he\u2019d run away physically and emotionally as fast as he could.</p><p>He wanted to have sex without consequences or commitments, and that\u2019s what I offered him. I guess deep down I expected him to be so overcome with emotion he\u2019d admit his undying love for me. What a fool I was. I was the one so overcome with emotion that I couldn\u2019t stop the tears from running down my cheeks.</p><p>Last night was nothing but my stupid fantasy being crushed by reality.</p><p>I hug my knees and tell myself not to cry, that in time my heart will stop hurting so much.</p><p>I gather my stuff and go outside to wash up. It\u2019s hard to keep my head held high and my emotions in check, so I put on my sunglasses.</p><p>Derek isn\u2019t anywhere in sight. When I come out of the bathroom, Derek has already packed up the car and is in the driver\u2019s seat.</p><p>We don\u2019t say another word as we drive past Sylvia and Irving sitting at their folding table playing cards. I wave at them and they wave back. It\u2019s bittersweet seeing a couple who\u2019ve beaten the odds and stayed together for so long. My parents couldn\u2019t do it, my sister and Nick couldn\u2019t do it . . . Derek and I couldn\u2019t even last one night.</p><p>I look out the window until Derek pulls into a drive-through and asks what I want for breakfast.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want anything,\u201d I say without glancing in his direction.</p><p>\u201cYou have to eat.\u201d</p><p>I push my glasses up. \u201cI\u2019m not hungry.\u201d</p><p>He orders two glasses of orange juice and two bagel-and-egg combos, then parks the car. \u201cHere,\u201d he says, placing one of the wrapped bagels on my lap. \u201cEat.\u201d</p><p>I toss it back at him and step out of the car.</p><p>\u201cAshtyn!\u201d Derek calls after me.</p><p>I walk down the street, ignoring him.</p><p>\u201cAshtyn!\u201d</p><p>He catches up with me. My sunglasses can\u2019t hide the tears streaming down my face.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want me to say?\u201d He blocks my path. He\u2019s got a tense, frustrated look as he rakes his fingers through his hair. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you and I have this attraction that won\u2019t go away. I\u2019m sorry you want someone who\u2019ll be there for you when nobody else is. I\u2019m sorry I couldn\u2019t just have a one-night stand when I knew you were cryin\u2019 about it. I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m not the guy you want me to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to be sorry!\u201d I wipe my tears away. I want you to tell me that I mean something to you. But the words won\u2019t come out of my mouth. I\u2019m a coward, afraid of what he\u2019ll say if I tell him how I truly feel. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want a stupid bagel as a consolation prize.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe bagel wasn\u2019t a consolation prize, Ashtyn,\u201d he argues. He shoves his hands into his pockets. \u201cIt was breakfast. I was trying to get things back to normal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNormal? Nothing in my life is normal, Derek. But if you want me to fake it, then fine. I\u2019m good at faking shit.\u201d I hold my hands over my heart. \u201cThank you so much for the bagel,\u201d I say in a fake sweet voice. \u201cI\u2019ll go choke it down right now so you can feel like everything is normal.\u201d</p><p>I turn on my heel and walk back to the car. I have nowhere else to go and can\u2019t escape, so I might as well resign myself to the fact that I\u2019m stuck with Derek until we get to Texas.</p><p>After we eat in tense silence and I\u2019m done with the bagel, I hold up the empty wrapper. \u201cSatisfied?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot even close,\u201d he says stoically.</p><p>He drives me to a field when I tell him I need to get some practice time in. I stretch out and kick my practice balls while Derek leans against his car, texting. He doesn\u2019t offer to help retrieve the balls. Every once in a while he glances my way, but for the most part he couldn\u2019t care less about football or helping me. He\u2019s got his stupid phone held up to his face until I tell him I\u2019m ready to head out.</p><p>I drive part of the way while Derek sleeps. When we switch back, I lean my head against the window and fall asleep.</p><p>\u201cAshtyn,\u201d Derek\u2019s deep voice wakes me up. \u201cWe\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>I open my eyes, blurry from sleep. Derek gently shakes me again. I blink a few times to focus and notice that Derek is looking down at me with beautiful blue eyes he doesn\u2019t deserve. It\u2019s not fair that he has those eyes, because they confuse girls\u2014confuse me.</p> <p>Derek pulls up to the front entrance of Elite. My heart starts racing. This is it, everything I\u2019ve been waiting for. Scouts will be here, taking back information to their coaches about who they believe are the best players to recruit. I look around and realize I\u2019m the only girl.</p><p>A crowd of parents and teens are scattered across the lawn. Some are in the check-in line and others are laughing and joking around as if they\u2019ve known each other for years.</p><p>Derek puts on a baseball cap and sunglasses. He reminds me of a movie star who doesn\u2019t want to be noticed.</p><p>He helps grab my luggage. \u201cYou gonna be okay?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t look him in the eye. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, I would stay and wait until you get settled, but . . .\u201d He glances at the football players milling around, then pushes the baseball cap farther over his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m gonna head over to my grandmother\u2019s place and see what\u2019s up with her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine.\u201d I grab my bags out of his grip. \u201cI guess I\u2019ll see you in a week.\u201d</p><p>He lets out a sigh. \u201cI guess so.\u201d</p><p>It doesn\u2019t escape my mind that he hasn\u2019t touched me since we were in the tent. We\u2019re not arguing like usual, or interacting at all really. We\u2019re just . . . existing. He gives me a small smile.</p><p>\u201cBye, Derek.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye.\u201d When I start walking away, he takes my elbow and urges me back. \u201cHave fun. Kick some ass and show \u2019em what you got. You can do this, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, Ashtyn, I don\u2019t know what to say. Last night\u2014\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t want to hear him say sorry again, so I cut him off. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. Just leave.\u201d</p> <p>He nods slowly. I want to call him back as he gets in his car, to tell him that I need to make things right between us, but I don\u2019t. I can\u2019t. I told him to love me for one night, and he couldn\u2019t.</p><p>I watch as Derek\u2019s car drives away and disappears as it turns the corner. Whether I like it or not, I\u2019m on my own.</p><p>I straighten my shoulders and move to the end of the check-in line. I\u2019m aware of a couple of stares from players and some parents. I\u2019m a girl playing a boy\u2019s sport, and while my team has gotten used to having a female teammate, some guys don\u2019t believe girls should play football. They think we\u2019re too fragile. I just have to keep my head held high and act like I belong here as much as they do.</p><p>Derek\u2019s words echo in my head: You can do this.</p><p>A couple of guys in front of me nudge each other, urging their friends to gawk at the lone girl in line. One turns to me and says, \u201cYo, cheerleading camp is down the block. You\u2019re obviously lost.\u201d</p><p>His friends laugh.</p><p>I push my duffel farther up on my shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m in the right line.\u201d I cock an eyebrow. \u201cYou sure you\u2019re in the right line?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m sure, baby.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m about to say some comment back to him when the guy at the registration table calls out, \u201cNext!\u201d and waves me over. \u201cName?\u201d</p><p>I clear my throat. \u201cAshtyn Parker.\u201d</p><p>The guy scans me up and down. \u201cYou\u2019re the girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d The guy\u2019s a genius.</p><p>He hands me a new backpack, a water bottle, and a folder all with the Elite Football logo. \u201cThis has your schedule for the week and the key to your dorm room. Uniforms will be given out before practice tomorrow. Make sure you wear your name tag at all times,\u201d he says, slapping a sticker with my name on it on my T-shirt. He places the sticker awkwardly by my neck because he\u2019s obviously uncomfortable placing it anywhere near my chest like all the other players. \u201cCafeteria is on the first floor of the dorms, right by the lounge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>As I walk away, one of the coaches calls me over. \u201cWelcome to Elite, Ashtyn,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m Coach Bennett, the special teams coach. I\u2019ll be working with you this week.\u201d</p><p>I shake his hand. \u201cI\u2019m glad to be here, Coach. Thanks for the opportunity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn case you didn\u2019t know, you\u2019re the only female in the program. Since there are no showers designated for women, the showers for the rest of the players will be closed from five to five forty-five a.m. and seven to seven forty-five p.m. so you can have privacy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne more thing,\u201d he says. \u201cWe won\u2019t tolerate sexual harassment of any kind. If you feel harassed at any time, inform me or anyone else on staff. That being said, I hope you have a thick skin. Boys will be boys. Don\u2019t jump the gun, if you know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>After the harassment talk, I head to the dorm and find my room at the end of the hall. All the guys have roommates, but I\u2019ve got a single. I drop my bags on the floor and sit on the edge of my bed. There\u2019s a small closet, a window, a twin bed, and a desk. It\u2019s basic, but it\u2019s clean and spider-free. And no Derek. I\u2019ve gotten used to having him around and hearing his voice. Even now, I miss him.</p><p>It doesn\u2019t take long for me to put my stuff away. If I were a different girl, I\u2019d sit in my room and hide until tomorrow, when the program officially starts. Instead, I head for the lounge to meet the guys I\u2019m going to be playing with for the next week. I catch sight of Landon sitting with a couple of guys on one of the couches. I don\u2019t have any emotion besides a desire to show him and everyone else here that I\u2019m competitive and I\u2019m here to prove it.</p><p>No way I\u2019m letting Landon think I\u2019m intimidated. I\u2019m captain of my team back home and represent them as well. This isn\u2019t just about me. I stand right in front of him. \u201cHi, Landon.\u201d</p><p>He glances at me, gives me a pathetic mumbling \u201cHi,\u201d then goes back to talking to the guys without introducing me. It\u2019s obvious he doesn\u2019t want me sitting with him, so I find an empty chair on the other side of the lounge. I try to start a conversation with a couple of the guys sitting around me. They give short answers, then walk away like I\u2019m contagious or something.</p><p>I\u2019m walking back to my room when I overhear a bunch of guys talking with their door open. If they were my teammates, I\u2019d be sitting with them. I\u2019m an outsider in unfamiliar territory. Why be timid now, when I know being a loner won\u2019t do me any good on the field tomorrow?</p><p>I straighten and am about to walk in the room to introduce myself when I hear a guy say, \u201cDid you see that chick in line this morning?\u201d</p><p>Another guy gives a short laugh. \u201cThat dude McKnight told me she got in the program so they can have a token female. The girl is delusional enough to think she belongs here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe better not be on my team,\u201d one guy says.</p><p>The other guys express similar opinions and suddenly I\u2019m not in the mood to make friends.</p><p>I rush to my room and throw myself on my bed. Normally I\u2019d be ready to challenge the guys, to show I\u2019m not intimidated by their lack of enthusiasm of having to play with a girl. Right now I don\u2019t feeling like proving myself and feel totally defeated.</p><p>For the first time since I got voted captain, I don\u2019t feel like one.</p><p>Chapter 41</p><p>Derek</p><p>I look up at the motorized gate that slowly opens after I announce my arrival over the intercom. Some people would be impressed by my grandmother\u2019s massive estate, but I\u2019m not into flaunting money or status. This house does both.</p><p>I park my car in the circular drive and look up at the tall pillars flanking the oversize front door. I\u2019m sweating, and it\u2019s not from the morning sun beating down on me. Meeting my grandmother on her own turf is like facing an unknown team in a playoff game. You can\u2019t really prepare effectively for the game and you\u2019re anxious until it\u2019s over.</p><p>A guy wearing a black suit and a serious expression is at the entrance waiting for me. \u201cYou with the Secret Service?\u201d I ask, trying to lighten the situation.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t seem amused. \u201cFollow me.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m led into the house. The place is filled with high ceilings and large corridors, reminding me of those fancy cribs showcased on television. The staircase is polished metal, and the furniture is overstuffed and likely overpriced, too. The guy in the suit stops in front of a room overlooking the swimming pool in the backyard. It\u2019s filled with white furniture and purple cushions. It\u2019s completely feminine and over-the-top. I wonder if Ashtyn would like it or prefer her lived-in, old furniture back home.</p><p>I wanted to stay with her this morning until she was settled in the dorm. That was before I saw a few guys who would have definitely recognized me. I wanted to tell her about my past, but what good would it do? Saying nothing and booking out of there before anyone recognized me was the easy way out and I took it.</p><p>I\u2019m looking out the window at the big pool in the backyard, wishing Ashtyn were here with me, when I hear someone come into the room. I turn around and recognize my grandmother right away. She\u2019s wearing a stark white suit, her hair is all poofed up, and her makeup is overdone. I\u2019m taken aback that she\u2019s tan and looks like she just came from a vacation instead of the hospital.</p><p>She holds her head high like a queen when approaching her subjects as she walks up to me with her arms outstretched. \u201cAren\u2019t you going to say hello to your grandmother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, Grandmother,\u201d I say with a deadpan expression. I don\u2019t mask the fact that I\u2019m not her biggest fan, but at least I don\u2019t flinch when she walks closer and gives me one of those fake air kisses. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She holds me at arm\u2019s length.

You look like a pauper in those ripped jeans and T-shirt that I\u2019d no more use as a dishrag than wear on my body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucky for you it\u2019s my clothes and not yours.\u201d</p><p>She makes a harrumph sound. A lady in a maid\u2019s uniform walks into the room with a silver tray filled with little sandwiches and tea. After she leaves, my grandmother points to one of the wicker couches. \u201cHave a seat and some refreshments.\u201d</p><p>I stay standing. \u201cListen, I hate to state the obvious, but you don\u2019t look like someone on her deathbed. You said you were dyin\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>She sits on the edge of a chair and takes her time pouring tea into a fancy cup. \u201cBless your heart. I didn\u2019t exactly say I was dying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said you were havin\u2019 treatments. You have cancer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Sit down. The tea is getting cold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDiabetes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. The sandwiches are made with cheese imported from the south of France. Try one.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cParkinson\u2019s? Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease? A stroke?\u201d</p><p>She waves her hand in the air, dismissing all the ailments I listed. \u201cIf you must know, I was resting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cResting? You said you were diagnosed. You said seein\u2019 me was your last dyin\u2019 wish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are all dying, Derek. Every day we\u2019re alive is one day closer to our death. Now sit down before my blood pressure rises.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a blood pressure problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re about to give me one.\u201d When I don\u2019t move, she sighs heavily. \u201cIf you must know, I had a little procedure. I spent some time recovering at a spa in Arizona until the twentieth.\u201d</p> <p>Procedure? I\u2019ve fallen into a trap and was manipulated into coming here. As she reveals little bits, the truth suddenly dawns on me. I\u2019m a fool. \u201cYou had plastic surgery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to call it going in for a tune-up. You should be familiar with that term, seeing as your father always did like to fiddle with his own cars instead of bring them to a professional.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s supposed to be an insult, you\u2019re off the mark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, well . . .\u201d My grandmother looks up at me without an ounce of shame. \u201cWhat I\u2019m getting at is that it\u2019s not easy to see yourself getting older. You\u2019re my grandson, and the only family I have left. I\u2019ve been a widow for ten years and your mother is gone. You\u2019re the last Worthington.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a Worthington. I\u2019m a Fitzpatrick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, well, that is unfortunate.\u201d</p><p>Truth is, she\u2019s so used to acting like Texas royalty I don\u2019t think she realizes how arrogant she sounds. \u201cI don\u2019t think my dad would agree with you.\u201d</p><p>She clears her throat as if she\u2019s got something stuck in it. \u201cHow is that Army man doing these days?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s in the Navy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019d send his regards, but he\u2019s on a submarine for the next five months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe abandoned his new bride so soon after the wedding? Pity,\u201d she says in a monotone voice. \u201cDerek, sit down. You\u2019re making me nervous. It\u2019s bad enough you won\u2019t cash your trust fund allowance checks and I have to resort to sending you cash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t ask for a trust fund, or an allowance.\u201d My grandparents set it up when I was born. I think it was their way of luring me to Texas with the hope I\u2019d work for Worthington Industries one day. \u201cBy the way, Sunnyside Nursing Home says thank you for your generous donation.\u201d</p><p>My grandmother sighs. \u201cI got the thank-you card. I am already a benefactor to many charities. The money is for you, Derek. You might dress like one, but I don\u2019t want you living like a pauper. Now sit down and eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not hungry. Listen, Grandma, in your letter you said you had somethin\u2019 important to tell me. Why don\u2019t you just spill it and get it over with, because truthfully this grandson-grandma bonding thing ain\u2019t workin\u2019 for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want the truth?\u201d</p><p>Duh. I hold up my hands, urging her to come out with it already. I\u2019m ready to leave here and book a hotel for the week.</p><p>\u201cI want you to come live with me.\u201d She doesn\u2019t blink and she doesn\u2019t have a smirk on her face. I think the woman is serious. She might not be deathly ill, but she\u2019s obviously delusional.</p><p>\u201cNot gonna happen. You\u2019re wastin\u2019 your time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a week to change your mind.\u201d She takes a calculated sip of tea, then sets the cup on the table. \u201cYou will give me a week, Derek. Won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me one reason I shouldn\u2019t walk out that door right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s what your mother would have wanted.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 42</p><p>Ashtyn</p><p>It\u2019s the first day of practice, where we\u2019ll be assessed and placed onto teams for scrimmages. I wake up when my alarm rings at five and head to the showers. There\u2019s a big sign on the door of the bathroom:</p><p>5:00 a.m.\u20135:45 a.m.</p><p>CLOSED FOR FEMALES ONLY</p><p>Someone crossed out FEMALES ONLY and wrote FREMONT\u2019S BITCH instead. The words cut deep.</p><p>I stand under the hot shower. I want to go home. Maybe Landon was right, that I got accepted to Elite because I\u2019m a girl and they wanted to fill some sort of quota.</p><p>What am I doing here?</p><p>I leave the bathroom and pull off the sign. I\u2019m not about to tattle for a stupid sign calling me Fremont\u2019s bitch. I\u2019d lose respect for not being able to take a joke. Five guys are already standing in line with towels around their waists, waiting to enter. One of them is Landon. He snickers when I walk past him and says something to the guy standing next to him.</p><p>Back in my room, I glance at my cell phone and notice I\u2019ve got five texts.</p><p>Jet: Find us a new QB who\u2019ll transfer to Fremont, even if you have to sleep with him! Take one for the team. JK (kind of)</p><p>Vic: Don\u2019t fuck up! jk (kind of)</p><p>Trey: Don\u2019t listen to Jet or Vic. (Monika told me to write that. She\u2019s sitting next to me.)</p><p>Monika: Good luck! XOXO</p><p>Bree: R cute guys there? Txt me pics!</p><p>They remind me that I have a job to do now that Landon turned out to be a jerk and abandoned our team. If I can get scouts to come to Fremont and watch me play, every player will get a chance to be seen. I can\u2019t give up or back down.</p><p>My phone rings right before I head outside for practice. It\u2019s Derek. I ignore the call. I have so much to say to him, but I can\u2019t say it now. I need to focus on football this week, nothing else.</p><p>On the field, the head coach blows his whistle. While the players gather around, he gives a lecture on sexual harassment. Way to make the guys resent me even more . . . All eyes are on me and I just want to disappear until it\u2019s over. I don\u2019t even hear the pep talk before we do calisthenics and drills, because I\u2019m still aware of all the stares. It\u2019s a closed practice, so parents and scouts are not allowed to attend today. None of the guys stand near me or talk to me.</p><p>The kicking coach, Coach Bennett, has the kickers work on technique for a long time, then in the afternoon has us kick the ball starting from the goal line. He increases the distance by a yard after every successful kick. I\u2019m the best of the group, until Coach Bennett assigns the quarterbacks as holders so we can practice kicking and they can practice a trick play in a fake field goal situation.</p><p>Landon is assigned as my holder. He saunters over to me with an arrogant smirk on his face. I would ask Coach Bennett to assign me another holder, but nobody likes a player who complains. What would I tell him, that Landon is my ex-boyfriend and I don\u2019t want to play nice with him? He\u2019d probably laugh in my face, then send me packing.</p><p>Football isn\u2019t for the weak, physically or mentally.</p><p>I can do this. I look around at the other kickers who are called on first. They\u2019re all at the top of their game, like specially trained machines who know what to do and when to do it. A bunch of guys I\u2019ve only heard about but never met are on the field, mini celebrities with big egos to match their talent. I can imagine everyone here playing at the college level and beyond.</p><p>When Bennett calls me and Landon up for our turn, I get ready for the snap and attempt to execute a perfect kick right through the middle of the goalposts, but Landon tilts the ball at the last second and the ball tumbles on the ground after I kick the tip of it instead of the sweet spot. He does it so subtly that nobody else besides me can tell, unless you had a video camera and could replay it in slow motion.</p><p>\u201cYou whoring around with Derek?\u201d Landon mumbles when I get back in position for a second attempt.</p><p>I ignore Landon and focus. This time, when the ball is snapped to Landon, he lets go of his hold on the ball at the last second so I miss it completely and fall hard on my ass.</p><p>\u201cOh, no! You okay?\u201d Landon asks with fake concern. He holds his hand out to help me up, but I swat his hand away.</p><p>\u201cHold the fucking ball so I can kick it!\u201d I yell as I get to my feet.</p><p>He twists his fists in front of his eyes. \u201cBoo-hoo. Feeling sorry for yourself because you and your team are gonna suck without me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMcKnight, on the bench. Hansen, replace McKnight as holder!\u201d Bennett calls out.</p><p>As Charlie Hansen jogs on the field to replace Landon, the two quarterbacks slap hands as they pass each other.</p><p>I get in position and Hansen takes the snap. At the last second, he tilts the ball slightly so I can\u2019t kick it right. It\u2019s an epic fail. I can hear snickers on the sidelines from the guys watching.</p><p>At dinner I sit alone at one of the tables. I\u2019m sore, tired, and defeated.</p><p>The next two days are repeats of the first. I\u2019m assigned a team, but none of the guys talk to me. I\u2019m perfect when I\u2019m kicking off the tee, but when the guys are holding the ball for me nothing I do will work. Somehow Landon has managed to sabotage me.</p><p>After evening practice on Wednesday, the head coach, Coach Smart, calls me into his office. It\u2019s in the main building near where I registered the first day. As I enter the office in full football gear, Coach Bennett is standing next to Coach Smart with my stats for the day.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the problem, Parker?\u201d Coach Smart asks me. \u201cWe brought you here because we saw potential. Not many female players make it past the high school level, but we thought you had what it takes to beat the odds.\u201d He points to the stats. \u201cTo say we\u2019re not happy with your performance so far is an understatement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not happy with my performance, either. The guys are sabotaging me.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s no sympathy or understanding\u2014just a coach itching to get more out of his player. \u201cYou gotta figure out how to play through whatever drama is going on behind the scenes. There\u2019s always gonna be guys who want to create trouble and make other players look bad. It\u2019s up to each individual to rise above it and figure a way to make it work. We\u2019ve got scrimmages the rest of the week, and a big game on Friday night. There\u2019ll be parents, scouts, the media . . . a full house. You want to go home and give up, Parker, just say the word.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to go home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you come here for a reason?\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cYeah, Coach, I did.\u201d I had just forgotten what it was.</p><p>\u201cAll right, here\u2019s the deal.\u201d He leans forward. \u201cIf you want to play Friday without embarrassing yourself and this program, you have two days to get it together and figure out how to make these guys want you on their team.\u201d</p> <p>I swallow, but there\u2019s a lump in my throat. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>After leaving his office, I tell myself it doesn\u2019t matter why or how I got here\u2014I\u2019m here and need to prove myself now more than ever. You can do this. I silently repeat Derek\u2019s words in my head over and over, hoping I\u2019ll soon believe it.</p><p>I\u2019m about to walk out of the building, when I stop to check out the pictures of players on the wall who\u2019ve attended the Elite program and have gone on to have solid NFL careers. They even have a wall of fame with pictures of their top players.</p><p>I stop and blink at one of the photos on the wall. No, it can\u2019t be. Below it is a small gold-plated plaque engraved with the words DEREK FITZPATRICK \u201cTHE FITZ\u201d\u2014MVP. Above the plaque is a photo of a player leaping over a bunch of linemen for a touchdown.</p><p>MVP at Elite? It can\u2019t be the same Derek Fitzpatrick who couldn\u2019t throw a football in a spiral to save his life. The same Derek Fitzpatrick who makes my insides melt every time I\u2019m with him. The same Derek Fitzpatrick I almost made love to in the tent.</p> <p>I step closer to the picture. There\u2019s no mistaking it\u2014it\u2019s Derek. His eyes, his intense focus . . . that cocky, lopsided grin. His features are so familiar to me now.</p><p>I\u2019ve known Derek for weeks. I\u2019ve slept in the same bed with him. I\u2019ve fallen for him . . . and yet he\u2019s made sure I never saw the real him that hides behind a bunch of lies.</p><p>The burning feeling in the middle of my chest is fueled when I think about Derek just standing there listening to me while I stressed over the fact that Landon ditched us and we\u2019re left without a decent quarterback. He knew I\u2019d do just about anything to find a solid quarterback for Fremont. Yet he never even hinted he was a trained quarterback, an MVP.</p><p>Coach Bennett comes up to me. I gesture to the offending picture. \u201cHow good was he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFitz? He was the best quarterback I\u2019ve ever seen. There are some guys who are born to play football. Fitz was one of \u2019em. Blew everyone away with his talent and ability to read the defense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to him?\u201d</p> <p>Coach Bennett shrugs. \u201cHe quit playing and never came back. Shocked the hell out of us, that\u2019s for sure. Haven\u2019t seen anyone with that much natural talent since.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Landon McKnight?\u201d</p><p>Coach Bennett nods. \u201cMcKnight is decent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s an all-state player and almost went undefeated last year,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>\u201cThe goal is to be undefeated, not almost undefeated. Right?\u201d</p><p>I nod.</p><p>\u201cWith enough training and practice, McKnight is definitely on his way.\u201d He taps the picture of Derek. \u201cAs a freshman and sophomore, Derek Fitzpatrick led his team to the state championship.\u201d</p><p>That statement lingers in the air. Derek went to State. Wow. What would it be like to play in the state championship? Derek knows.</p> <p>Back in the dorm, I pull out my cell and search \u201cDerek Fitzpatrick Football.\u201d The first thing that comes up is a news article about a boy football prodigy who\u2019d had the attention of Division I schools since he was fourteen. By his sophomore year in high school, he\u2019d gotten three offers for full scholarships to college after he graduated. Another article\u2019s title is Derek Fitzpatrick, Prodigy Quarterback. At the end of the article is a picture of the boy wonder himself.</p><p>I follow links to article after article, one more impressive than the next. It\u2019s hard to think the person who dominates my thoughts had a secret past he never revealed. Did the thought of playing for Fremont with me ever cross his mind these past few weeks?</p><p>The betrayal cuts deeper than Landon\u2019s ever did. Landon and I dated, but I know now that it was superficial. He never really loved me. I was trying to fill a void in my life, an emptiness that I\u2019d been living with. He played me for a fool and schemed with Bonk from Fairfield.</p><p>Truth is, Derek has played me for a bigger fool. You can do this, he\u2019d said. Did he mean it, or was it another one of his jokes?</p><p>We agreed to stay out of each other\u2019s lives, but that\u2019s not going to happen. I call a cab to come get me. Back home, Coach Dieter always tells us to play clean.</p><p>I disagree. It\u2019s time to play dirty.</p><p>Chapter 43</p><p>Derek</p><p>I\u2019m staring at the expensive designer suit the butler Harold laid out on my bed. I\u2019m sure my grandmother told him to place it there so she can keep trying to mold me into the grandchild she always wanted. I\u2019ve been here for three days now, and I\u2019ve been counting down the days until I can pick up Ashtyn and head back to Illinois. I abandon the suit and find the old lady in her oversize dining room.</p><p>She takes one look at me and frowns. \u201cDerek, make your grandmother happy by changing into something other than those rags you call clothes. Didn\u2019t Harold bring up the suit I bought for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did, but I\u2019m not wearin\u2019 it.\u201d I reach out and take a piece of bread off the large buffet, but she slaps my hand away. \u201cWait for the guests.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuests?\u201d A sinking feeling settles in my chest. \u201cWhat guests?\u201d</p><p>She looks way too proud of herself. That fake smile she\u2019s trying to hide is an indication that she\u2019s up to something. \u201cI\u2019ve arranged a little get-together with some of the teenagers in town, that\u2019s all.\u201d She takes my face in her hands. \u201cI know many single debutantes who have impeccable bloodlines, Derek.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBloodlines? You plannin\u2019 on setting me up with a mare? C\u2019mon, isn\u2019t that a little old-fashioned, even for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have a lady friend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you mean a girlfriend, the answer is no. I\u2019m not lookin\u2019 for one, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense. You need to be fixed up. It\u2019s as simple as that.\u201d She walks with purpose to the opposite side of the room. \u201cYou\u2019re tall, handsome, and you happen to be the grandson of the late Kenneth Worthington. It\u2019s time you embrace the fact that you\u2019re the heir to Worthington Industries, the biggest textile distributor in the world. You, my dear grandson, are a catch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to be caught.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat attitude means you haven\u2019t met a girl worthy of your attention. You\u2019ll want to be caught if the right girl comes along.\u201d</p><p>I grab a piece of bread from the buffet and take a big, obnoxious bite out of it. \u201cThanks for the offer, but I don\u2019t need to be fixed up,\u201d I say with a mouth full of bread.</p><p>Her top lip curls in disgust. \u201cI thought you went to a private school. Didn\u2019t they teach you basic manners?\u201d I open my mouth to answer, but she holds a hand up. \u201cDon\u2019t answer with your mouth full. Just . . . go upstairs, put your suit on, and come down when you\u2019re decently attired. Guests will be arriving shortly.\u201d When I don\u2019t look the least bit interested in dressing up for her shindig, she flashes me a practiced, superficial smile. \u201cPlease, Derek. Humor me for one night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re gonna say my mother would have wanted me to wear that suit, I swear I\u2019m walkin\u2019 out that door and never comin\u2019 back. Don\u2019t pretend to know anything about my mother, because you were the one who disappeared from her life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know my daughter more than you think, Derek.\u201d When I shake my head and am about to tell her off, she motions me to follow her out of the room. \u201cCome with me. I need to show you something.\u201d</p><p>My instinct is to act like a stubborn asshole and walk out, just to make a point. But a voice in my head urges me to stay and follow the old lady.</p><p>My grandmother leads me to a big room filled with enough books to fill a small library. She closes the door and slides one of the shelves aside to reveal a safe. With agile fingers, she carefully opens the safe and pulls out an envelope.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d she says, sliding a letter out of the envelope and handing it to me.</p><p>I glance at the paper and immediately recognize my mother\u2019s handwriting. The letter was dated two weeks before my mom died. She\u2019d been weak back then and knew she didn\u2019t have much time left. I\u2019d asked her if she was afraid . . . I couldn\u2019t say the rest of my sentence out loud. \u201cOf dying?\u201d she asked. When I nodded, she took my hand in hers and said, \u201cNo. Then I won\u2019t be in pain anymore.\u201d A few days later she stopped talking and lay in bed all day, waiting to die.</p><p>My grandmother stands in front of me with her head bent as I read my mother\u2019s words.</p><p>Dear Mother,</p><p>I remember when I was a little girl I didn\u2019t talk because I was shy, but you told the other moms I was too intelligent to speak. I found out you paid off one of the judges of the beauty contest I entered in junior high so I\u2019d win. I never told you the manager at The Burger Hut said he couldn\u2019t hire me the summer before my senior year of high school because you wanted me to intern with Daddy at Worthington Industries instead.</p><p>For a long time I thought you did those things to control my life. As a mom myself, I realize now that you wanted to create this perfect life for me because you loved me.</p><p>Take comfort in the fact that I\u2019ve lived the perfect life. Steven Fitzpatrick is my one true love. Derek is my little football star and an amazing son\u2014he\u2019s funny and handsome like his father and strong-willed and wild-spirited like me. He\u2019s perfect.</p><p>I have one request. Please take care of my son when Steven can\u2019t, Mom. Look after him, because I won\u2019t be around to do it much longer.</p><p>Love always,</p><p>Katherine</p><p>I fold the letter up and blink back tears as I hand it back to my grandmother. \u201cI\u2019ll go change,\u201d I say.</p><p>No other words need to be said. I get why I\u2019m here and why she wants me to stay.</p><p>A half hour later I walk down the stairs in the suit she bought me. I leave the tie upstairs and unbutton the top two buttons of my shirt as a statement that my mom\u2019s wild spirit lives inside me, and that isn\u2019t going to change anytime soon.</p><p>The foyer is crowded, full of teenage girls in bright-colored dresses and big hair. Knowing how my grandmother operates, she already has a suitable bride picked out and the prenuptial papers drawn up and ready to be signed.</p><p>Lucky for me, guys are also invited, so I\u2019m not the only buck on display.</p><p>Ashtyn would laugh at a party like this, where you gain popularity points by how much money and status you have instead of how much alcohol you can ingest before you puke. I\u2019ll bet nobody here has ever played Fact or BS with Jell-O shots. Or shaved their ball sacs, for that matter.</p><p>\u201cDerek!\u201d my grandmother calls out as she winds her way through the mass of people milling around. \u201cYou forgot your necktie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She reaches out and buttons the top two buttons of my shirt. \u201cIt\u2019s customary to wear a tie when you\u2019re at a formal function. You look like the gardener.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I hold her face in my hands, like she did to me less than an hour ago. \u201cThis might be a formal function to everyone else, but to me it\u2019s a dog and pony show. You want me to pretend to be one of \u2019em, this is what you get.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you pretend a little harder?\u201d she asks, then leans in to say, \u201cCassandra Fordham and her mother have been staring at you since you came downstairs.\u201d</p><p>I unbutton the top two buttons again, then undo a third one for good measure. \u201cWho\u2019s Cassandra Fordham?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly the most beautiful girl in Texas. She wins beauty pageants, has incredible skin tone, and plays the piano.\u201d</p> <p>Skin tone? Beauty pageants? Those attributes don\u2019t hold a candle to a girl who knows how to get down and dirty on the field and in a tent. \u201cDoes she play football?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFootball?\u201d My grandmother laughs. \u201cGirls don\u2019t play football, Derek. They watch it. And yes, I\u2019m sure Cassandra Fordham is a fan of the game. She\u2019s a Texan, born and raised. Football is in our blood. She\u2019s right there.\u201d She does her best not to make it obvious that she\u2019s pointing to the girl in an off-the-shoulder yellow dress. The yellow rose of Texas.</p><p>My grandmother slips a hand through my elbow and leads me toward Cassandra Fordham. I\u2019m aware that most eyes are on me. Obviously Cassandra has been pegged the most desirable girl in the room. Since I\u2019m the guest of honor, I have the feeling it\u2019s customary that I get first dibs.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Fordham, Cassandra, I\u2019d like you to meet my grandson, Derek Fitzpatrick,\u201d my grandmother says in an assertive voice.</p><p>Cassandra is model pretty. She\u2019s got a small, perky nose and blue eyes that practically light up when she smiles. She does a small curtsy-type move. \u201cHow are you enjoyin\u2019 Texas so far, Derek?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou want the truth?\u201d</p><p>My grandmother subtly elbows me and busts out a fake laugh. \u201cDerek has been entertainin\u2019 me all week. Y\u2019all should see him play tennis. We\u2019ve been playin\u2019 every afternoon after lunch. He\u2019s a natural.\u201d</p><p>I haven\u2019t stepped foot on the tennis court since I\u2019ve been here.</p><p>\u201cI play, too,\u201d Cassandra says in a sweet feminine voice. \u201cMaybe we should play sometime.\u201d</p><p>My grandmother nudges me again. \u201cOf course he will. Right, Derek?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p> <p>After some more small talk, my grandmother asks Mrs. Fordham her opinion on her new artwork in the living room and leaves me standing beside Cassandra. I feel like I\u2019ve stepped into a time warp. Everyone talks and eats while soft music from a four-string quartet plays in the background. It isn\u2019t long before Cassandra grabs my elbow and starts introducing me to the other girls and guys at the party.</p><p>I get a break when she excuses herself to go to the restroom. I walk in the dining room and grab a bite. As I find a seat at the table, a bunch of girls surround me. I\u2019m not gonna lie\u2014the girls are hot. Texas has some of the prettiest girls I\u2019ve ever seen in my life, and I\u2019ve lived a bunch of places. I briefly wonder how they stay so thin when the food here is rich and fattening. Then I look down and notice that their plates are full of food, but they don\u2019t actually put any of it in their mouths. It\u2019s a scam, if you ask me.</p><p>Ashtyn would pile her plate high and enjoy the food without worrying what the guys here would think. Every day I\u2019ve called her, but she hasn\u2019t answered. This morning I left her a text message telling her to call me. She hasn\u2019t.</p><p>After eating and wandering around talking to a couple of guys about football, their main topic of conversation, Cassandra appears at my side. She spurts impressive football stats like water, but it\u2019s as if she\u2019s been groomed to know about the sport without actually liking it.</p><p>I duck out and sit on one of the cabana chairs, hoping to be left alone. Reading that letter from my mom changes everything. When I read her words, it was like she was talking to me from the grave. She called me her football star. Man, that slashed open a wound that\u2019d been stitched closed for a while now.</p><p>My privacy doesn\u2019t last long, because female hands cover my eyes and Cassandra\u2019s high voice whispers in my ear, \u201cGuess who?\u201d</p><p>Chapter 44</p><p>Ashtyn</p> <p>As I walk up to the front entrance of the Worthington mansion with a mission to confront Derek, it suddenly dawns on me that I should have changed. I just threw on a pair of long shorts and my practice jersey, which has grass and mud stains on it from today\u2019s practice.</p><p>I ring the doorbell. A tall man with a grim expression answers the door. \u201cMay I help you, miss?\u201d</p><p>I peek inside. The mass of people standing around in dresses and suits emphasizes the fact that I\u2019m underdressed. If I cared, I\u2019d call the cab back and leave. But I don\u2019t care. I\u2019m on a mission, and nobody\u2019s going to stop me. \u201cI need to see Derek Fitzpatrick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd who may I ask is calling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAshtyn.\u201d When that doesn\u2019t seem to satisfy him I say, \u201cAshtyn Parker.\u201d</p><p>An older woman with striking blond hair and diamonds around her neck comes to the door and stands beside the guy. She\u2019s wearing a light blue tailored dress with a matching jacket. When I look into her sapphire eyes, I get a jolt of recognition. Those are Derek\u2019s eyes . . . this is Derek\u2019s dying grandmother.</p><p>Except she doesn\u2019t look like she\u2019s dying.</p><p>She looks healthier than most people I know. She eyes my football jersey and purses her lips like she just ate a sour lemon. \u201cWho are you?\u201d she asks in a haughty tone.</p><p>\u201cAshtyn Parker.\u201d I should have brought my name tag from Elite.</p><p>She tilts her head and focuses on my bare legs. \u201cMiss Parker, my dear. Are you aware that you\u2019re wearing boys\u2019 clothes?\u201d</p><p>Umm. How do I explain to a woman so impeccably dressed that I came here straight from football practice? \u201cI play football. I had practice all day, and didn\u2019t have time to change before I came here. Derek and I drove here together from Illinois.\u201d When she doesn\u2019t look impressed, I add, \u201cHis dad is married to my sister.\u201d That might earn me some credibility.</p><p>It doesn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cMy grandson is indisposed at the moment, Miss Parker,\u201d she says. \u201cIf it\u2019s not urgent, you can come back another time.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s trying to intimidate me. It\u2019s working, but I still stand my ground. I have to find out why Derek lied to me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I tell her. \u201cI don\u2019t mean any disrespect, but I need to see him now and I\u2019m not about to leave. It is urgent.\u201d</p><p>Derek\u2019s grandma finally opens the door and gestures for me to enter the house. \u201cFollow me,\u201d she says, then orders the guy who opened the door to find her grandson and escort him to the library. She leads me through the crowd of teenage partygoers. This place is huge, like a museum. Some of the girls are staring at me and whispering to their friends.</p><p>I stop dead in my tracks when I catch sight of Derek and some girl through one of the huge windows leading to the massive backyard. She\u2019s got her arms wrapped around him, and my heart feels like it\u2019s being dragged over a cheese grater. It hasn\u2019t even been a week since we were in the tent, about to make love. Knowing that he could quickly hook up with another girl less than a week later makes me nauseous.</p><p>I squeeze my eyes shut and hope the girl is just a stupid figment of my imagination. I wish her to disappear. I should know better than for any of my wishes to come true, because they\u2019ve never come true in the past. I open my eyes and, sure enough, she\u2019s still there.</p><p>\u201cMiss Parker, dear, don\u2019t stare. It\u2019s bad manners,\u201d Derek\u2019s grandmother chides, then takes my elbow and leads me to a room with two couches, bookshelves filled with books, and a huge marble fireplace.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to interrupt your party,\u201d I tell her, trying to tell myself that it doesn\u2019t matter that Derek is with another girl. I have no hold on him. I\u2019m here to confront him, not make him fall in love with me. The fact that I fell hard for him is something totally out of my control and that just sucks for me. I look at his grandmother and hope she can\u2019t see right through me. \u201cIt must be hard for you to host so many people in your condition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCondition?\u201d</p><p>I squirm. \u201cYou know, being so sick and all that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sick, dear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The woman sits on a small couch in the middle of the room with her feet crossed at the ankles. She places her hands neatly in her lap. \u201cSit down, Miss Parker.\u201d</p><p>I awkwardly take a seat across from her. Do I cross my legs at the ankles? I\u2019m in unfamiliar territory. The woman has an air of authority and superiority about her. She\u2019s eyeing me with keen eyes, as if she\u2019s judging my every move. I cross my gym shoes at the ankles but imagine I look like an idiot.</p><p>\u201cTell me about the relationship you have with my grandson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy relationship?\u201d I almost choke on the word.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m, um, not sure what you mean.\u201d</p><p>She leans forward. \u201cI assume, Miss Parker, that since you came here on an \u2018urgent\u2019 matter you and Derek are familiar with each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t really say that. Most of the time Derek tries to annoy me and I ignore him. That\u2019s of course when we\u2019re not arguing, which we do quite often. He\u2019s a player and manipulator and he has a big ego. He\u2019s got this annoying habit of running his hand through his hair when he\u2019s frustrated. And he practically stole my dog. Did you know he\u2019s obsessed with smoothies? He won\u2019t eat a Skittle or anything with a preservative in it to save his life. It\u2019s not normal\u2014he\u2019s not normal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. Interesting.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m so wound up, I\u2019m not finished with my tirade. \u201cAnd he lied to me. Did you know he used to play football?\u201d</p><p>Derek\u2019s grandmother nods. \u201cI am aware of that, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAware of what?\u201d Derek says as he walks in the room. I hadn\u2019t noticed before, but he\u2019s wearing a suit, as if he\u2019s going to a wedding. Or a funeral. He steps back in shock when he realizes that I\u2019m in the room. \u201cAshtyn, what\u2019re you doin\u2019 here?\u201d</p><p>The past few days I\u2019ve missed seeing his face every day. When the guys were giving me a rough time this week, I thought of his words: You can do this. But the truth slapped me in the face as soon as I looked up at that MVP wall . . . and now he\u2019s standing here in front of me right after he was in the backyard with that girl.</p><p>I can\u2019t think straight. I want to ask about the girl, but just the thought of him with another girl makes my insides tighten and I can\u2019t manage to get the words out. Instead, I focus on the reason I came here in the first place. \u201cYou were a fucking prodigy!\u201d</p><p>Derek\u2019s expression is grim. \u201cHow\u2019d you find out?\u201d</p><p>I walk up to him and poke a finger into his chest. \u201cYour picture is plastered on the MVP wall at Elite. Ever hear of a Google search? You are such a liar!\u201d My heart is racing when I add, \u201cAnd I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re hooking up with someone after what happened between us.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAhem!\u201d Derek\u2019s grandmother clears her throat loudly. \u201cMiss Parker, obviously you have a lot on your mind and would like to hash this out. I\u2019m just not sure this is the proper time or place to have this conversation. Derek, why don\u2019t you invite her to come back tomorrow to discuss football and such.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow\u2019s fine,\u201d he tells her.</p><p>\u201cYeah, now\u2019s fine,\u201d I say. \u201cI don\u2019t care what you do or don\u2019t do with girls, Derek. I didn\u2019t come here to talk about anything else but why you lied to me about playing football.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t lie, Ashtyn.\u201d He doesn\u2019t look the least bit guilty. \u201cListen, I\u2019m not sayin\u2019 I didn\u2019t leave stuff out.\u201d</p> <p>I laugh heartily. \u201cLeave stuff out? Oh, that\u2019s rich. You outright lied. I remember plain as day you said you were an average foot-ball player. Average, my ass.\u201d I huff a few times, trying to gather my wits as I tell myself to stop shaking. \u201cI read that you played varsity as a freshman and led your team to two state championships. Do you know what I\u2019d do to get my team to State? Just about anything, and you know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t play anymore. And no matter what you think, I didn\u2019t hook up with anyone else since we were together.\u201d</p><p>Derek\u2019s grandmother steps between us. \u201cMay I remind you both there\u2019s a party going on just outside that door. A party that just happens to be in your honor, Derek.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA party that I never asked for, remember?\u201d Derek counters, then says to me, \u201cYou want to talk about lyin\u2019, let\u2019s put everythin\u2019 out on the table. You\u2019re not innocent, either. You told me you were okay with a one-night stand. That couldn\u2019t be farther from the truth and you know it.\u201d</p><p>My heart skips a beat. I can\u2019t look at him or respond, because I might be tempted to admit the truth.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to make this about you and me,\u201d I tell him. \u201cIt\u2019s about football. You can\u2019t just stop playing when you\u2019re, like, amazing at it. Actually, some people are amazing at it. You\u2019re . . . how did they describe it? Exceptional. Not only that . . . one article said they\u2019d \u2018never seen a young quarterback like Fitzpatrick, who could read players and adjust his strategy during plays like a pro.\u2019\u201d</p><p>He laughs, dismissing the assessment. \u201cThey might have exaggerated a little. You sure you came here to talk football? I think you came here because you missed me. Why haven\u2019t you texted me back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t change the subject. I read at least five articles online. They all say approximately the same thing. You were MVP at Elite. I\u2019ve seen the caliber of the players there. They\u2019re the best of the best, the guys who\u2019ll no doubt be starting in the NFL after college. Play with me, Derek. One last season.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m goin\u2019 back to the party.\u201d Derek opens the door, but holds out a hand before leaving. \u201cYou want to join me, Sugar Pie?\u201d</p><p>I look down at my football jersey. \u201cI\u2019m not dressed for a party, and you didn\u2019t answer my question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI answered it. You comin\u2019 or not?\u201d</p> <p>He walks out of the room when I don\u2019t join him, leaving me alone with his grandmother. \u201cWell, that was . . . entertaining, to say the least,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to have bothered you.\u201d Feeling like I just lost a glimmer of light in my pathetic life, I pull out my cell. \u201cI\u2019ll call a cab and be out of here in\u2014\u201d</p><p>His grandmother pulls the phone out of my hand and turns it off. \u201cYou should stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>She hands the phone back to me. \u201cI\u2019ve decided that you should stay here for the night. Attend the party and see what the night has to offer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not exactly dressed for a party and it\u2019s obvious I\u2019ve bothered you enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a shame I didn\u2019t host a costume party.\u201d She grabs the edge of my grass-stained jersey with the tips of her thumb and forefinger. \u201cDidn\u2019t your mother teach you to look in the mirror before you leave the house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother left when I was ten. She didn\u2019t teach me much.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd your father?\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cHe\u2019s kind of in his own world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see. Well, you might as well get over the fact that you\u2019re not going back to that football camp tonight. I\u2019ll have Harold drive you back first thing tomorrow morning.\u201d She walks to the door and clears her throat. \u201cTake a shower and make yourself decent. A neighbor of mine owns a boutique in town. She\u2019ll bring over something acceptable for you to wear.\u201d</p><p>Derek\u2019s grandmother leads me upstairs to a bedroom with an attached private bathroom. She tells me to hurry and wash up. I get the distinct impression that I better not disobey her. I don\u2019t want to attend the party, but she doesn\u2019t seem to care about my opinion. All I want to do is convince Derek to play for Fremont, but that doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s about to happen.</p><p>After a quick shower, I call Coach Bennett and inform him I\u2019ll be back in the morning for practice. I hang up and notice a short, white strapless cocktail dress neatly spread out on the bed. How did Derek\u2019s grandmother get it so fast? On the floor is a pair of red stilettos. The whole outfit looks expensive and elegant. I step closer and notice the dress still has the tags on it.</p><p>Reaching out, I turn over the price tag. The dress is seven hundred dollars. I\u2019ll bet everything in my closet adds up to seven hundred dollars, and I don\u2019t even own a pair of stilettos. There\u2019s no way I can wear a dress that expensive, or shoes with heels this high.</p><p>I touch the silky fabric of the dress. I\u2019ve never felt anything so soft in my life and wonder what it would feel like against my skin. Dropping my towel, I hold the material up to my body and look at myself in the mirror. Bolstered by the fact that nobody is watching, I unzip the garment and squeeze into it. I imagine being a princess and having this dress as one of many in my vast wardrobe of designer clothes.</p><p>I look in the mirror and hardly recognize myself. The dress hugs my curves and my breasts press against the material so they\u2019re pushed up and give me more cleavage than I usually have. It makes me feel sexy and, dare I think it, powerful.</p><p>Derek accused me of being here because I missed him. The truth is, I\u2019ve thought about him too much. Thoughts of him have invaded my mind. I wish they\u2019d go away. Every time I need encouragement, I think of his words. Every time I feel alone, I think of when we kissed and he smiled at me.</p><p>Prodigy quarterback.</p><p>Derek could save our team. He said he doesn\u2019t play anymore. Did he even contemplate picking up a ball again? If I had the power to make him fall in love with me, would he change his mind and join the Fremont team? I look at myself in the mirror, then slip on the stilettos.</p><p>There\u2019s only one way to find out.</p><p>Chapter 45</p><p>Derek</p><p>My grandmother, who\u2019s been flitting around like a butterfly, is suddenly ignoring me. I\u2019ve tried to get her attention three times since I left her and Ashtyn in the library. I know Ashtyn hasn\u2019t left because I\u2019ve had my eye on the front door the entire time.</p><p>I finally run into my grandmother when she rounds the corner on the way to the dining room. \u201cWhere is she?\u201d I ask.</p><p>My grandmother puts her hand to her chest. \u201cYou startled me. Don\u2019t sneak up on an old lady like that. You could\u2019ve caused a heart attack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour heart\u2019s fine. Where\u2019s Ashtyn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean that poor girl who dresses like a boy?\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe one you called Sugar Cake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019d be Sugar Pie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s right.\u201d She removes a piece of invisible lint off my suit jacket and takes her time buttoning my shirt back up. \u201cYou\u2019re transparent, Derek. Just like your mother was at your age.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re thinkin\u2019 what I think you\u2019re thinkin\u2019, you\u2019re wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you won\u2019t mind that I invited Sugar Pie to stay the night.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t want Ashtyn anywhere near my grandmother. She\u2019s up to something. Everything the woman does is calculated and deliberate. She\u2019s not just being nice to Ashtyn by inviting her to stay here tonight. I can tell by the gleam in her eye that she wants information out of Ashtyn; information about us. That\u2019s as dangerous as giving secrets to the enemy.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll drive her back to the dorm,\u201d I tell her.</p><p>She waves her hand in the air. \u201cNonsense. It would be in bad taste to make the poor girl go back to a dorm room with questionable amenities when we have more than enough space right here.\u201d</p><p>Oh, hell. It\u2019s useless to argue because it\u2019s obvious I\u2019m not winning this argument. \u201cWhere is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn one of the guest rooms. And I might have given her a dress to wear. She can\u2019t possibly attend one of my parties dressed in that filthy football jersey and shorts. Bless her heart.\u201d</p><p>Oh, no. Did she have to pull out the \u201cbless her heart\u201d phrase again? Those words are like a loaded gun in Texas, where that phrase could either be an insult or a term of endearment, depending on the tone or intent.</p><p>\u201cStay out of my business, Grams.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what business is that, Derek?\u201d When I don\u2019t answer, she pats my chest in a patronizing manner. \u201cDon\u2019t call me Grams ever again. You just remember to be a gentleman, like a Worthington host should be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a Fitzpatrick.\u201d</p><p>She raises a brow as she starts walking away. \u201cBless your heart.\u201d</p><p>I glance up, wondering if my mother is laughing her ass off right now or cursing the day she wrote that letter to my grandmother.</p><p>I start talking to a bunch of guys as I scan the place wondering if Ashtyn will appear anytime soon. For all I know she\u2019s locked herself upstairs and isn\u2019t coming down. This is definitely not her scene, where the girls are overdone and overdressed and the guys put on a smile and a suit. If this were a mud-wrestling match, she\u2019d probably be jumping in the ring right about now.</p><p>A streak of white on the staircase catches my eye and I freeze.</p><p>Whoa.</p><p>It\u2019s Ashtyn, wearing a short white dress that hugs her curves, and bright red stilettos that show off her long legs. I\u2019m frozen in place and can\u2019t take my eyes off her. She catches the attention of my grandmother, who gives her a nod of approval.</p><p>\u201cWho is that?\u201d one guy asks.</p><p>\u201cNever seen her before,\u201d another says.</p><p>A guy who was introduced to me as Oren gives a low whistle. \u201cDamn, she\u2019s hot. I call first dibs.\u201d</p><p>Nobody\u2019s getting first dibs on Ashtyn if I have anything to say about it. Without hesitating, I walk over to her. The tops of her creamy white breasts are popping out, no doubt tempting every guy in the place, and those sexy shoes she\u2019s got on are what fantasies are made of. \u201cWhat\u2019re you wearin\u2019?\u201d I ask in a harsher tone than I intended.</p><p>\u201cOh, you like it?\u201d She twirls around slowly, giving me, and the guys still watching her, a 360-degree view. She almost trips on the heels and grabs my shoulder to steady herself. \u201cYour grandmother let me borrow it. And the shoes, too. How cool are they?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI liked you better in the football jersey,\u201d I mumble.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe this is me.\u201d She heads for the buffet. \u201cI\u2019m starving. As you know, doing drills all day is hard work.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, I know. Don\u2019t you want to go back to the dorm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrying to get rid of me?\u201d She absentmindedly takes a gourmet cookie from one of the silver trays and starts eating it.</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m tryin\u2019 to keep those guys over there from hittin\u2019 on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you do that?\u201d She takes another bite. And another. And another. She licks frosting off her lips. If her intent is to drive me insane, she\u2019s doing a damn good job of it.</p><p>\u201cBecause I . . . care about you,\u201d I tell her.</p> <p>\u201cOh, please. Those are empty words. I\u2019ve heard those words from my mom, my sister, my dad, and even Landon. They mean nothing to me.\u201d</p><p>They mean something to me. \u201cYou think I\u2019m bullshittin\u2019 you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I saw you with that girl with the yellow dress tonight. Did you tell her you cared about her, too?\u201d She\u2019s so riled up she keeps munching on the cookie as if it\u2019s the last one she\u2019s ever gonna have. When she\u2019s done, she slaps her hands together and wipes off the crumbs. \u201cI think I\u2019ll go over by the staircase and meet new boyfriend prospects. They look like clean-cut, honest boys.\u201d</p><p>Her words are meant to slice right through me. \u201cDon\u2019t let the suits fool you,\u201d I tell her.</p><p>\u201cLike you fooled me about your football experience?\u201d</p><p>Before I can tell her I\u2019m not the answer to her prayers when it comes to recruiting a new quarterback for Fremont, Ashtyn puts her shoulders back. Does she realize it only manages to push her breasts out more? Everyone here is going to get more than an eyeful. She turns her back to me and walks toward the guys, who are still watching her with interest. I follow, not because I think she needs protection . . .</p> <p>It\u2019s because I sense she\u2019s about to do something really, really stupid.</p><p>Chapter 46</p><p>Ashtyn</p><p>A crowd of boys are standing together in a huddle in the corner of the room. Their eyes are on me, and I do my best imitation of a runway model as I make my way over to them. I\u2019m not nervous around guys, so why am I feeling agitated and clammy all of a sudden? There\u2019s a tingling, itchy sensation running down my neck. I ignore it, even though it\u2019s driving me nuts.</p><p>I put a hand on my hip and smile. \u201cHey, guys. I\u2019m Ashtyn.\u201d</p><p>Two of the guys furrow their brows and immediately walk away. Another guy shoves his hands in his pockets and steps back. \u201cI\u2019m Oren,\u201d he says nervously. His eyes dart from side to side, as if he\u2019s looking for a way to escape.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m, uh, Regan,\u201d the fourth guy says. Regan is totally focused on my chest with his eyes totally bugged out. I\u2019m still clammy, but I\u2019m tempted to point to my face and say, \u201cMy face is up here, buddy!\u201d</p><p>Oren waves to someone across the room, then mumbles, \u201cMy girlfriend is over there. I better go check on her.\u201d</p> <p>Regan suddenly pulls a phone out of his pocket. \u201cI got a call. Sorry.\u201d But I never heard it ring or vibrate.</p><p>I\u2019m standing alone, wondering why I just managed to scare away four guys in less than thirty seconds, when Derek comes up behind me. \u201cStrike out?\u201d</p><p>I look and feel sexy in this crazy minidress and shoes, but no boy will talk to me. Besides Derek. I\u2019m trying to make him jealous. How can I do that when four guys sprinted away like I had a disease? I need Jet here. He\u2019d have no problem pretending to flirt with me and would happily make guys think I was a great catch. Or Victor, who\u2019d stand next to me like a bodyguard and make sure nobody sprinted away from me.</p><p>I whirl around to face Derek. \u201cDid you come to rub it in my face?\u201d I ask as I rake my nails down my neck and clear the itchiness in my throat.</p><p>\u201cWhoa. Ashtyn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>His eyes are focused on my chest.</p><p>\u201cCowboy, my face is here. Stop staring at my boobs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not lookin\u2019 at your boobs.\u201d He gestures to my chest and says, \u201cYou\u2019re havin\u2019 some kind of allergic reaction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not,\u201d I say defiantly before clearing my itchy throat again. But . . . I examine my arms. They feel hot and as I look closer I realize they\u2019re red and splotchy. Oh, shit. \u201cYes, I am.\u201d</p><p>The only way I know how to flirt with Derek is to challenge him and beat him at his own game. But it\u2019s practically impossible to argue when you\u2019re in the middle of an allergic reaction.</p><p>I look down at my arms, which are tingling and irritated. And my neck . . . it\u2019s like a hundred little mosquitoes bit it at the same time. My throat is really starting to itch now. The most unlady-like noise comes out of my mouth when I attempt to ease the discomfort.</p><p>Derek looks panicked. \u201cSeriously, can you breathe?\u201d he asks. \u201cOr should I call 9-1-1 right now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I can breathe. I\u2019m not gonna die, Derek. Just a dose of Benadryl should help.\u201d I back up against the wall behind me and rub my shoulder blades against it.</p><p>Derek quickly takes my hand and leads me to his grandmother, but I stumble a few times. I\u2019m not used to walking in high heels.</p><p>\u201cDo you have Benadryl?\u201d he asks his grandmother. \u201cI think she\u2019s allergic to something in a cookie she ate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s allergic to cookies?\u201d his grandmother asks, her voice full of skepticism.</p><p>I scratch my arms, trying to relieve the itchiness. \u201cI\u2019m allergic to purple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe caterer put a W on the cookies in purple. It\u2019s a regal color.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRegal?\u201d Derek shakes his head. \u201cWe\u2019re not royalty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. So at the last minute I told her to change it to yellow, so she put yellow frosting over the purple frosting to mask it.\u201d His grandmother has a worried look on her face as she quickly tells Derek where to find the Benadryl.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d he says, moving me through the crowd as I try not to scratch my neck even though it\u2019s itching like crazy.</p><p>I stumble again. \u201cDerek, wait. I can\u2019t walk fast in these heels.\u201d</p><p>I give a little squeak of surprise when one of his arms slides under my knees and the other supports my back as he picks me up. Normally I\u2019d order him to put me down, but I\u2019m too agitated and uncomfortable to be strong right now. I wrap my arms around his neck and lean into him. I\u2019m suddenly surrounded by the scent of his cologne and I breathe it in.</p><p>\u201cYou smell like a guy,\u201d I mumble into the crook of his neck.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t,\u201d he says back. \u201cYou smell like flowers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s the soap your grandmother had in the shower. It was pink, with little pieces of flowers in it. It was like bathing in a bouquet of roses.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know how he manages to carry me up the entire staircase without stumbling or stalling, but he does it. Is he aware that everyone is pointing at us? If he is, he obviously doesn\u2019t care.</p><p>We reach the huge master bedroom, and he nudges open the door with his foot. The place is huge, with a sitting room next to the bedroom and a bathroom beyond that. Expensive paintings are scattered on the walls and the carpeting looks plush, like you can sink your toes into it. Derek sets me down in the bathroom and rummages through his grandmother\u2019s medicine cabinet.</p><p>\u201cStop scratchin\u2019,\u201d he orders, taking my hand and holding it at my side.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help it. I swear that\u2019s the last time I eat a cookie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should have gone for the fruit.\u201d He finds the Benadryl box and hands me two pills. \u201cHere, take these.\u201d After I down the pills with water from the sink, Derek crosses his arms on his chest. \u201cIf your condition doesn\u2019t improve within a half hour, I\u2019m takin\u2019 you to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you said the night we hooked up, and look at where we are now.\u201d</p><p>I glance at the walls. \u201cWe\u2019re in your grandmother\u2019s bathroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not being literal. Stop scratchin\u2019, Ashtyn. You\u2019re makin\u2019 marks all over your body.\u201d</p><p>I try my hardest to ignore the itching sensation, but that\u2019s like trying to ignore the boy standing in front of me\u2014practically impossible.</p><p>My breath hitches when he takes my hands and holds them behind my back. \u201cStop! You\u2019ll make yourself bleed.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s keeping a small distance between us, but why? Did all his feelings for me fade once he dropped me off at Elite? I need to fight to get those feelings to the surface, to remind him how amazing it was when we were in the tent.</p><p>My thoughts are all confused, and the itching doesn\u2019t help matters. I\u2019m supposed to be mad at Derek for lying to me about his football experience and at the same time I\u2019m determined to make him fall for me in an attempt to make him play football again. My real feelings are pushed aside right now, because if I acknowledge them, it\u2019ll break me apart inside.</p><p>I know Derek likes me, but just how much? He\u2019s desperate to keep his distance and doesn\u2019t want to admit that we had something more than just a casual hookup\u2014something that I know can grow to be more than that.</p><p>I squirm in his grasp. \u201cI\u2019m still itchy.\u201d</p><p>He glances down at my neck and chest. \u201cBe patient and let the Benadryl work,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a patient person.\u201d I moan in frustration.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He releases my hands. \u201cHere, let me help. You\u2019ve already done enough damage . . . there\u2019s scratch marks all over your neck. People are gonna think someone assaulted you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only thing to alleviate an itch is to scratch it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and the only thing to make your skin more irritated is to rake it with your damn nails. If you promise to stay still, I\u2019ll help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you gonna do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep your hands to your side and trust me.\u201d</p><p>Trust. There\u2019s that ugly word again. \u201cSeriously, my skin itches. You wouldn\u2019t understand because you\u2019re not having an allergic reaction to purple frosting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh. You talk too much. Close your eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re stubborn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t meant to be a compliment.\u201d</p><p>I stare him down, but then as the itching gets worse I give in and wait patiently for his remedy.</p><p>I suck in a breath when he traces my neck in slow, rhythmic circles with the tips of his fingers, making my skin tingle instead of itch. I throw my head back and keep my eyes closed, giving him full access. \u201cYou remind me of a cat right now,\u201d he says in a low voice.</p><p>He traces my jawline, the outline of my neck, my chest . . . dipping lightly inside the top of my cleavage peeking out of the dress before venturing back up again. His fingers are like a caress and I\u2019m getting light-headed and dizzy, so I reach out and grab on to him.</p><p>The sensual touch of his fingers is sending little jolts of electricity through my veins. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMmm . . .,\u201d I moan.</p><p>His fingers linger over my shoulders before repeating the process all over again. \u201cYou\u2019re enjoyin\u2019 this too much, Sugar Pie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, so keep doing it, Cowboy.\u201d</p><p>His laugh is deep and hearty, just like him. \u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d he says in a heavy southern accent. After a while I can feel the soft sensation of his fingers being replaced by his soft, warm lips. His breath soothes my skin as the itching subsides.</p> <p>My insides turn into liquid fire as I pull him closer.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you two doing?\u201d his grandmother\u2019s voice booms from the doorway.</p><p>I whip my head up and lose my balance, but Derek catches me solidly in his arms. How are we going to explain this one? It\u2019s not like the woman is blind. I had my eyes closed, but his grandmother didn\u2019t. There\u2019s no escaping the fact that Derek\u2019s lips were on my neck and I was urging him closer.</p><p>\u201cI was helpin\u2019 her,\u201d Derek explains.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh,\u201d his grandmother replies unconvincingly. She narrows her eyes as she holds out her finger. She wags it at both of us. \u201cI wasn\u2019t born yesterday. I know there\u2019s some hanky-panky goin\u2019 on between you two. Come now, Derek. A bunch of guests are fixin\u2019 to leave. You\u2019re the guest of honor and need to say your good-byes. You can finish helping Ashtyn later.\u201d</p> <p>Derek checks the blotches on my arms and chest to make sure they\u2019re fading. \u201cYou want to join me downstairs or stay up here?\u201d</p><p>The itching subsides some. I look in the mirror and cringe. My skin is still all blotchy. This night isn\u2019t how I imagined it going down. I was ready to play dirty, but I didn\u2019t imagine it would be like this. \u201cMaybe I should just go back to the dorm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Derek shakes his head. \u201cYou\u2019ll stay here tonight. I\u2019ll drive you back to Elite in the mornin\u2019. Okay?\u201d</p><p>I walk to my designated room while Derek and his grandmother spend the next hour saying good-bye to the guests. My hockey jersey and shorts have been cleaned and are lying on my bed. I hang up the dress, then put on my jersey and slip under the down comforter. I feel like I\u2019m sleeping on a marshmallow mattress, it\u2019s so soft. It cocoons me as I sink into it and turn on the TV.</p><p>Derek\u2019s grandmother is the first one to knock. She walks in the room looking elegant and totally put-together even after hosting a party with at least seventy-five to a hundred people. Not a hair is out of place.</p><p>I must look like a mess. \u201cThank you for letting me borrow the dress. It\u2019s beautiful.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t thank me. It\u2019s yours to keep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you can and yes, you will. Don\u2019t argue with an old, stubborn lady like me. You won\u2019t win.\u201d She leans over me to check my neck. \u201cHow\u2019s the itching?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s all better,\u201d I tell her.</p><p>Satisfied that I\u2019m not still having a reaction to the purple cookie frosting, she sits in a chair next to the bed. She puts her hands in her lap and looks at me with those Derek-lookalike eyes. \u201cSo . . . I know something is going on between you and my grandson. Care to tell me what it is?\u201d</p><p>I turn off the TV and give her my full attention. \u201cUmm . . . I\u2019m not sure, actually. Maybe you should ask Derek.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy grandson is not cooperative when it comes to sharing details about his life, bless his heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you\u2019ll use it against me,\u201d Derek chimes in as he appears in the room. His suit is gone and is replaced with sweatpants and a T-shirt, looking more like the Derek I know.</p><p>He walks to the foot of the bed and gestures to my neck. \u201cHow you doin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>I lift my head up to show him my chest. \u201cBetter. It\u2019s gone except for a few scratch marks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s too easy to get lost in the way he looks at me, those eyes that say so much more than any words can.</p><p>\u201cI need to go check on the staff and make sure all the food is packed up,\u201d his grandmother says, getting up from the chair and walking out of the room. \u201cLeave this door open.\u201d</p><p>When his grandmother leaves us alone, Derek lifts the covers and says, \u201cScootch over so I can sit next to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour grandmother said you need\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what she said. Move over.\u201d</p><p>I do. It feels good to have him here with me now, but even though physically we\u2019re close, mentally we\u2019re worlds apart.</p><p>I turn the TV on again and try to lighten the mood. \u201cI need a TV in my room back home. This is awesome.\u201d</p><p>We don\u2019t say anything else for a long time. Some movie is playing, but I\u2019m not paying attention to it because I\u2019m too aware of Derek sitting next to me.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t hook up with that girl you saw me with tonight,\u201d he says. \u201cShe wanted me to take her upstairs and ditch the party, but I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>For a long time he doesn\u2019t answer. But then he takes the remote and presses the mute button. He rakes a hand through his hair, and I hold my breath for his response. He turns to me, those piercing eyes of his capturing mine, and he says, \u201cBecause of you.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 47</p><p>Derek</p><p>The number-one rule in football is to not let your opponent know what your game plan is. I just revealed mine.</p><p>Just because I can\u2019t stop thinking about the girl doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m the guy who\u2019s gonna make everything right in her life. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverybody I care about hurts me,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve become used to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t intend to join the list.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you don\u2019t want to care about anyone who might actually have real feelings for you?\u201d She gives me a small, vulnerable smile.</p><p>\u201cListen, shit happened in my past that I just can\u2019t let go of . . . not yet, at least.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been through shit, too, Derek. Most of my life is spent trying to wade through it.\u201d She holds her hands up in frustration. \u201cI\u2019m fighting all the time for everything and I don\u2019t see you fighting for anything. It\u2019s like you want to keep punishing yourself for some unknown reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d This independent girl, who plays football and has a thicker skin than most guys I know, makes me want to share stuff with her that I\u2019ve never shared with anyone else. I take a deep breath and let out what I\u2019ve been holding inside for so long. \u201cThe day my mom died I got a call after school from one of the nurses at the hospital. She said my mom had been askin\u2019 for me all day.\u201d I throw my head back and wince, because the memory still fucking hurts. I\u2019d do anything to turn back time and do that day over again. \u201cI went to practice first, Ashtyn. I put football before my mom . . . I put it before everythin\u2019 else. When I finally got to the hospital, she was already gone.\u201d</p><p>Two days later I stood there watching as they lowered my mom\u2019s casket into the ground. I failed her. Her death was so permanent, so final. I\u2019d never get a second chance to make it up to her. \u201cI vowed I\u2019d never play again after she died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault she died, Derek.\u201d Ashtyn places her hand on my arm, her long feminine fingers warm and comforting. I wish she\u2019d been standing next to me at the gravesite so I wouldn\u2019t have felt so alone that day. Instead, I figured if I stopped caring about anything and everyone, I\u2019d eventually stop feeling anything at all. It worked.</p><p>Until I met Ashtyn Parker.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be okay,\u201d she says. \u201cOne day.\u201d She slips farther under the covers and lays her head on one of the oversize pillows, facing me. She reaches out and grabs my hand.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re tired. Want me to leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She\u2019s still got a grip on my hand. As her eyes close and she drifts off, she doesn\u2019t let go of my hand.</p><p>\u201cJust so you know,\u201d she mumbles as she drifts off to sleep. \u201cI did really crappy at football camp this week. Landon convinced the guys to sabotage me, but your words stuck in my head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat words?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can do it.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m sitting on the bleachers watching Ashtyn do drills in the combine and play during the Friday scrimmage. She has no clue I\u2019m here and I\u2019m trying to stay invisible so none of the guys recognize me\u2014I\u2019m wearing dark sunglasses and a baseball cap while sitting behind a bunch of parents and scouts.</p><p>She\u2019s stretching on the sidelines, completely focused. In the first quarter of the game, Ashtyn missed two field goals. I watched the ball holders closely. They tilted the ball when she approached so she\u2019d kick it at an awkward angle. More than a couple of parents in the bleachers laughed at her, and others complained that this is why a girl doesn\u2019t belong playing football.</p><p>The more the guys sabotage her, the more I have the urge to run on the field and replace the holder so Ashtyn can show everyone watching that she deserves to be here. But she wouldn\u2019t want that. She wants to fight her own battles.</p><p>I lean forward on my elbows as I watch the game. The guys are working hard, every one of them trying to get noticed by the scouts in the stands. McKnight is the quarterback on Ashtyn\u2019s team. He\u2019s a solid player and I can see why Ashtyn would want him on her team. But he\u2019s got an ego and taunts the opposing players when his team scores instead of focusing on the next play.</p><p>\u201cDerek! Derek!\u201d a woman\u2019s shrieking voice echoes loudly from the sidelines.</p><p>Oh, no. Please, no.</p><p>My grandmother is causing a huge scene, holding a bright purple sun umbrella and waving her hand like crazy to get my attention. She\u2019s wearing a big purple pantsuit that matches the umbrella. At first I ignore her, hoping she\u2019ll go away when I don\u2019t respond. Fat chance of that. She\u2019s got the attention of everyone in the stands and on the field.</p><p>\u201cWho is that?\u201d one of the parents asks no one in particular.</p><p>\u201cElizabeth Worthington,\u201d a guy sitting in front of her answers in a loud whisper. \u201cShe\u2019s the owner of Worthington Industries. Very influential lady. Her grandson trained here until his mother died. Quarterback.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. That\u2019s so sad.\u201d</p><p>Great. I\u2019ve become the subject of parent gossip. I cringe as my grandmother walks up the bleachers and loudly bellows, \u201cYoohoo, Derek!\u201d</p><p>All the spectators, including the scouts, are gawking and whispering among themselves. I might as well have come here with a sign on my head in fluorescent blinking lights saying DEREK FITZPATRICK.</p><p>My grandmother has no clue the commotion she\u2019s caused as she takes a seat next to me. \u201cPlease tell me why I had to learn from Harold where you\u2019d gone this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I didn\u2019t want you to come here and make a scene.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense.\u201d She cranes her neck as she scans the field. \u201cI can\u2019t see Ashtyn from these nosebleed seats. Where is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s the one on the sideline next to the kicking net. I swear if you wave to her I\u2019m ordering you to leave.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She keeps her hands down. \u201cOkay, okay. Don\u2019t get so cranky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s with the sudden interest in football?\u201d I ask her. \u201cYou never came to Elite when I was trainin\u2019 here.\u201d</p><p>She shifts in her seat and keeps her eyes on the field. \u201cThat\u2019s what you think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never saw you.\u201d</p> <p>My grandmother turns to me with a mischievous smile. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s because I didn\u2019t want to be seen.\u201d She clears her throat and turns her attention back to the game. \u201cI\u2019ve made mistakes in the past that I don\u2019t intend to repeat.\u201d She glances at me sideways. \u201cYou would be wise to do the same.\u201d</p><p>Mistakes. I\u2019ve definitely made my share.</p><p>After the game, a crowd of scouts surround us and bombard me with questions. So much for being invisible. I tell them I have no plans to play football again, but a few of them give me their cards and tell me to call them if I change my mind.</p><p>My grandmother says she\u2019s going to wait for Ashtyn to get out of the locker room, when I catch sight of McKnight walking toward the dorm. I meet up with him in the common area, ready to confront him about sabotaging Ashtyn.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit,\u201d fullback Justin Wade says. Justin and I were roommates my third year here. \u201cIt\u2019s \u2018The Fitz\u2019 in the flesh. Yo, Fitz, where ya been?\u201d</p> <p>A linebacker named Devon slaps me on the back. \u201cShit, man, I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re back. I thought you\u2019d still be on the fast track to playin\u2019 in the NFL for sure. When I heard you\u2019d stopped playin\u2019, it shocked the hell outta me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy team got creamed in the scrimmage,\u201d Justin says. \u201cWe sure could\u2019ve used you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not here to play,\u201d I tell them.</p><p>\u201cWait a second,\u201d Landon says. \u201cYou\u2019re Derek Fitzpatrick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe one and only, dude,\u201d Justin chimes in.</p><p>\u201cA legend around here,\u201d Devon adds, then tells Landon, \u201cHe\u2019s the one I was telling you about the other night.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo way. I can\u2019t believe this.\u201d Landon shakes his head as if he\u2019s still trying to figure out how I can be the guy in the pictures gracing the MVP wall at Elite. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cJust checkin on Ashtyn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, \u2019cause you want her for yourself?\u201d He gestures to the doorway. \u201cYou\u2019ve wanted to get into her pants the second you laid eyes on her, man.\u201d</p><p>I give a short laugh, the sound reverberating across the room. \u201cYou don\u2019t know shit, McKnight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know everything.\u201d He leans forward and whispers in my ear. \u201cIf I tell her I\u2019ll play for Fremont, I can have her back with a snap of my fingers.\u201d</p><p>I push him away from me.</p><p>He pushes me, then throws a punch.</p><p>With my blood at its boiling point, my fists are flying. He doesn\u2019t miss a beat and fires back, so both of us are going at it. My adrenaline is running at an all-time high, and he can\u2019t get a good shot because I\u2019m all in and don\u2019t want or need to stop fighting anytime soon.</p> <p>A bunch of guys try pulling us off each other, but I resist and shrug them off.</p><p>Until I hear Ashtyn scream, \u201cDerek!\u201d</p><p>I turn toward her voice, see her shocked expression, and get clocked in the jaw. Damn, that hurt. McKnight has a solid right hook.</p><p>If that isn\u2019t bad enough, the coaches start rushing in. Coach Smart, the head coach and the one who runs the Elite program, gets in between us. \u201cWhat the hell is going on here?\u201d</p><p>McKnight wipes blood off the corner of his mouth with the back of his hand. \u201cNothin\u2019, Coach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t look like nothin\u2019 to me.\u201d He steps between us. \u201cDerek, what the hell are you doing here starting trouble with one of my players?\u201d</p><p>His players. I used to be one of his players. \u201cSorry, Coach.\u201d</p><p>He barks orders to one of the assistant coaches to tend to McKnight, then grabs me by the front of my shirt and pulls me into the empty hallway. I think he\u2019s about to kick me out, but instead he gets in my face like he used to do when I was on the field. \u201cYou used to be a role model to these guys, Derek.\u201d He grabs my chin, making me wince in pain, as he examines my bruises. \u201cWhat\u2019s goin\u2019 on with you?\u201d</p><p>I shrug.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your old man?\u201d</p><p>I shrug again. \u201cIn the middle of the ocean somewhere.\u201d</p><p>He nods, as if somehow my father being deployed explains why I just got in a fight. He shakes his head. \u201cI heard you got kicked out of that academy in California. So you\u2019re getting in trouble instead of playing ball?\u201d</p><p>Ashtyn is standing at the door, glaring at me with anger and resentment. My grandmother and her umbrella are behind her.</p><p>\u201cYou know you should still be playing, don\u2019t you?\u201d Smart says. \u201cYou can\u2019t just forget everything you worked hard for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t forget it, Coach. I don\u2019t play anymore. End of story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour story can\u2019t end, Derek, because it never even started,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cThis discussion is over, Coach.\u201d I came here to fight for Ashtyn, not me. This isn\u2019t about me.</p><p>\u201cNot yet. You know I have zero tolerance for fighting,\u201d Coach says. \u201cYou can fight on your own turf and own time, not mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m leavin\u2019,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t leave.\u201d McKnight suddenly appears in the hallway with a few of the guys standing behind him. His posse. He holds out his hand. \u201cSorry, man. No hard feelings.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head in disgust and walk past him. I open the door and am about to walk out when I hear McKnight\u2019s voice. \u201cThat\u2019s all right, Derek. We all know you\u2019re afraid you can\u2019t live up to your legend status.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy grandson isn\u2019t afraid,\u201d my grandmother chimes in. She pokes her umbrella in McKnight\u2019s direction.</p><p>I squeeze my eyes shut. When I open them, I glance at Coach Smart. And McKnight and his posse. And my grandmother. And finally Ashtyn. Every one of them is wondering what I\u2019ll do.</p><p>In the end, I do what I\u2019ve been doing since my mom died.</p><p>I walk away and don\u2019t look back.</p><p>Chapter 48</p><p>Ashtyn</p><p>I can\u2019t just let him leave. My dad drives off when things get tough and he wants to escape. I won\u2019t let Derek get away that easy, so I stand in front of his car and block his path as he\u2019s about to drive away.</p><p>He rolls down his window. \u201cWhat\u2019re you doin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet out of the car!\u201d I yell. When he does, my blood boils and I storm up to him with long, purposeful strides. \u201cYou just fucked everything up for me!\u201d I growl, then shove my hands into his chest.</p><p>\u201cStop yellin\u2019,\u201d he says, glancing at the others around us.</p><p>\u201cNo, I won\u2019t stop yelling, because I\u2019m royally pissed off. You know I\u2019m fighting my ass off here, Derek. I\u2019m fighting to be treated like one of the guys. I\u2019m fighting to prove to everybody that I belong here.\u201d I\u2019m getting emotional and don\u2019t care that everyone within a hundred yards can probably hear my rant. \u201cI\u2019ve been fighting since the second I came to Elite. Get it in your thick head that I don\u2019t want you to fight for me. It just makes me look weak. I need to fight for myself, or it doesn\u2019t count. But dammit, Derek, when are you gonna fight for yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot gonna happen.\u201d</p><p>I swallow the knot in my throat and say, \u201cMy mom left when I was ten years old. She didn\u2019t give a shit about me, and I have to live every day knowing it. You\u2019re lucky. You know your mom loved you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucky?\u201d He gives a short, cynical laugh. \u201cAt least your mom is alive and you can talk to her. Do you know what I\u2019d do to talk to my mom for just one minute? One lousy minute! I\u2019d cut off my arm to have just one minute with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want out of life?\u201d I ask, challenging him to answer. I need to pull it out of him. \u201cWhat\u2019s your goal? Besides pretending not to care about anything, which I know is complete crap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t have one.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s bullshit. \u201cEveryone has a goal.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s averting his gaze because he knows if he looks at me I\u2019ll see right into his soul. The wounds that should have healed by now are still raw because of the massive amount of guilt he\u2019s carried with him since his mother\u2019s death. He keeps punishing himself for that one decision he made a long time ago.</p><p>I know he wants to fight for something . . . deep down he\u2019s got a basic, intense desire to compete. It\u2019s killing him that he\u2019s ignoring his instincts and instead is determined to keep himself a ghost of who he can be.</p><p>Joining the military after he graduates is Derek\u2019s way of feeding that competitive fighting spirit . . . he was fighting for me back at the dorm, but my conflict with Landon isn\u2019t Derek\u2019s fight to win\u2014it\u2019s mine.</p><p>Landon called Derek a coward. Suddenly it wasn\u2019t about me anymore, and Derek walked away.</p><p>Derek defiantly crosses his hands on his chest. \u201cPlease move so I can leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen to me.\u201d I lower my voice and say softly, \u201cShit happens, Derek. Life goes on, whether you want it to or not. People die, whether you want them to or not. Don\u2019t make up some bullshit in your head that you quit football for your mom. She gave you life. You think she\u2019d want your spirit to die right along with hers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t bring my mom into this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? Quitting won\u2019t bring her back. You say you don\u2019t have a goal? That\u2019s bullshit! You need to go for what you want and not hold back. When you figure it out let me know, because I\u2019ll bet my left nut you have a goal but won\u2019t admit to yourself what it is.\u201d</p><p>The corner of his mouth twists upward. \u201cYou don\u2019t have a left nut, Ashtyn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, you\u2019re acting like you don\u2019t have one, either.\u201d I don\u2019t mention the obvious\u2014that if he doesn\u2019t fight for himself, it\u2019s useless to fight for us. \u201cYou need to forgive yourself.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a long, brittle silence before he says, \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He looks past me and I turn around. His grandmother is standing across the parking lot, pretending not to be paying attention to our conversation. When I turn back, Derek\u2019s running a hand through his hair. \u201cMy grandmother wants me to come live with her. I decided it\u2019s probably best for both of us if I stay in Texas and go to school here. I\u2019ll get you a plane ticket back to Chicago on Sunday.\u201d</p><p>I let his words sink in as deep sorrow fills my chest. \u201cIs that what you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he says, his face stoic and unemotional. \u201cThat\u2019s what I want.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 49</p><p>Derek</p><p>I drive around the rest of the day, my mind trying to wrap around the idea that I\u2019m staying in Texas and moving in with my grandmother. When I arrive at her house, I find her sitting on a small bench in the foyer waiting for me.</p><p>\u201cWhere were you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOut.\u201d</p><p>She nods slowly. \u201cI talked to Ashtyn after you left. She\u2019s pretty upset.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah, well, she\u2019ll get over it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d</p><p>I look at her with a mixture of frustration and annoyance. \u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just think you\u2019re not being rational right now.\u201d She sighs loud and slow. \u201cShe said you\u2019re moving in with me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, yeah. I forgot to tell you that I\u2019m movin\u2019 in. Congrats, you got what you wanted.\u201d I start walking up the winding staircase to the second floor.</p><p>\u201cI want you to be happy, Derek. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve always wanted.\u201d She hesitates before saying, \u201cIt\u2019s what your mother would have wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know? She\u2019s not around to ask now, is she? Want to ask my dad what he thinks? Oh, yeah. He\u2019s not around, either,\u201d I say, sarcasm dripping from every word.</p><p>\u201cWell, regardless of who\u2019s around, you have to go back to Chicago to pack up your things if you\u2019re going to move in with me.\u201d</p><p>At the top of the stairs, I call out, \u201cGet movers to do it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNonsense.\u201d She stands tall and puts her regal nose in the air. \u201cI\u2019ve already arranged for the corporate jet to take us back to Chicago.\u201d</p><p>I stop dead in my tracks. \u201cUs? Who\u2019s included in \u2018us\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, Ashtyn . . . and me.\u201d</p><p>No, no. \u201cSorry to break the news to you, Grams, but that\u2019s not how it\u2019s goin\u2019 down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it is. It\u2019s a done deal and everything is already arranged. Harold will be picking up Ashtyn on Sunday at Elite and she\u2019ll meet us at the airport.\u201d She crosses her arms and gives me a dignified stare that dares me to challenge her. \u201cAnd that\u2019s how it\u2019s goin\u2019 down.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 50</p> <p>Ashtyn</p><p>I\u2019m sitting in front of Coach Bennett and Coach Smart on Sunday morning for my final evaluation. I fight the urge to bite my nails as they review my stats and performance this past week. They\u2019re also supposed to share any feedback from the scouts who were present at the scrimmages.</p><p>\u201cIt was a pleasure having you at camp this week,\u201d Coach Bennett starts. \u201cBoth Coach Smart and I are impressed by your determination and drive.\u201d</p><p>But not my performance.</p><p>Coach Smart nods in agreement. \u201cYou\u2019re the first female accepted to our program, Ashtyn. We knew there would be challenges, and you faced them head-on. That takes courage, and I admire that in my players.\u201d</p><p>Coach Smart takes time to go over my stats with me and I cringe. \u201cYour stats this week are not impressive, Ashtyn,\u201d he says. \u201cThe feedback from the scouts and coaches wasn\u2019t what you were probably hoping for, but Coach Bennett secured an interview with the Northwestern coach next week. No promises, but at least they agreed to talk with you.\u201d</p><p>Just the thought of being able to talk to a Big Ten football coach should make me excited and happy. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with me. It\u2019s like as soon as Derek told me he was moving to Texas, suddenly everything feels so . . . off.</p><p>\u201cNo matter what happens, all of us at Elite have faith that you\u2019ll accomplish whatever you set out to do.\u201d Coach Bennett smiles warmly and holds out his hand. \u201cWe will definitely be following your team stats this coming season and wish you all the best.\u201d</p> <p>I shake both of their hands. \u201cThank you both for the opportunity,\u201d I say, then gather my duffel from the dorm and wait for the limo to pick me up. I got a call last night that Mrs. Worthington is chartering the corporate jet.</p><p>I sit on the small airplane next to Derek. His grandmother insisted on coming with us. She says she wants to help Derek pack his stuff up. I heard Derek protest, but she just ignored him.</p><p>It\u2019s hard not to feel Derek\u2019s presence beside me. When we arrive home, Julian runs up to Derek with a big smile and my sister brings out cookies with the words WELCOME HOME in yellow frosting. I can\u2019t eat them. All they do is remind me of the night at his grandmother\u2019s house when Derek finally revealed everything he\u2019s held inside for so long.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Brandi. You must be Liz!\u201d Brandi says excitedly. Mrs. Worthington flinches when my sister calls her Liz instead of Elizabeth or Mrs. Worthington, but Brandi doesn\u2019t notice. \u201cIt\u2019s so nice that you came here for a little visit. Derek, isn\u2019t having your grammy here just the best?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d he says.</p><p>Mrs. Worthington whacks him with her purse. \u201cMy grandson is lacking in social graces, but I intend to fix that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Dad?\u201d I ask, changing the subject.</p><p>My sister points to the den. \u201cWatching television.\u201d</p><p>I peek into the den. \u201cWe\u2019re back, Dad.\u201d</p><p>He nods as if I\u2019d just come back from going to the grocery store.</p><p>\u201cDerek\u2019s grandma\u2019s here, too,\u201d I add, then gesture for him to get up and greet her.</p><p>He gets up, meets Mrs. Worthington for a brief moment, then walks back to the den and starts watching TV again.</p><p>\u201cNot a social fella,\u201d Mrs. Worthington mumbles as she walks around inspecting the rest of the house.</p><p>\u201cMy dad\u2019s kinda introverted,\u201d I explain.</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d Mrs. Worthington takes one bite of Brandi\u2019s cookie and spits it out in her napkin. \u201cDearie, are you trying to poison us, or just break our teeth?\u201d</p><p>Brandi laughs. \u201cI admit I\u2019m not the best baker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously.\u201d She pats Brandi on the cheek. \u201cWe must get you some cooking lessons, dearie. Before you kill my grandson.\u201d</p><p>Brandi giggles, thinking that Mrs. Worthington is joking. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s joking at all, but it\u2019s probably best that my sister is clueless.</p><p>A low bark echoes through the house before Falkor comes running up to me and gives me slobbery kisses. \u201cAnd this is Falkor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEww. Ashtyn, dear, please . . . get that animal to stop giving you a tongue bath. It\u2019s very unsanitary.\u201d</p><p>Derek kneels down and Falkor abandons me without a second thought. My dog rolls onto his back while Derek rubs his belly and tells Falkor how much he missed him.</p><p>After Mrs. Worthington is settled in my bedroom and the rest of us are in the kitchen, Derek breaks the news to my sister and Julian that he\u2019s moving to Texas.</p><p>My sister\u2019s smile fades.</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re my brother,\u201d Julian cries out. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to move to Texas. Don\u2019t leave!\u201d</p><p>My sister looks shocked and her eyes are glassy. \u201cI\u2019m sure Derek has thought long and hard about his decision, Julian,\u201d she says in a dull and sad voice. \u201cHe needs to do what he thinks is best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, buddy.\u201d Derek reaches out to Julian, but my nephew ducks out of his reach and runs upstairs. Derek has a grim look on his face as he follows Julian upstairs.</p><p>\u201cI failed my husband,\u201d Brandi murmurs. Her arms fall to her sides. She looks totally defeated. \u201cI fail in everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true.\u201d I walk up to her and put my arm around her shoulders, comforting her. \u201cYou\u2019re a great mom to Julian. He\u2019s a great kid, Brandi. You didn\u2019t have any help and he\u2019s so smart and sensitive.\u201d</p><p>She shrugs as she wipes away tears running down her pale, heart-shaped face. \u201cYou already pointed out that I\u2019ve been a shitty sister. I\u2019m obviously a horrible stepmother. I should have just stayed in California.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I hug her in earnest now as tears fall from my eyes, too. When she hugs me back, I choke back sobs. Derek will take a part of me with him when he leaves, and I don\u2019t think I can face the despair alone. I\u2019m tired and sad and don\u2019t want to be strong anymore. \u201cI need you, Brandi. I need my big sister and I\u2019m so, so glad you\u2019re back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d she asks, holding me at arm\u2019s length, surprised that I\u2019m crying along with her.</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She wipes the tears from my cheeks and gives me a sorrowful, knowing look. \u201cThis is about you and Derek, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>I nod, unable to say the words out loud.</p><p>She holds my face in her hands. \u201cI\u2019m here for you, baby sister. I\u2019m sorry, I feel like this is all my fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this kumbaya moment all about?\u201d Mrs. Worthington asks as she walks into the kitchen. \u201cI swear I feel like I\u2019m in a funeral home with all the crying going on. You know what heals everything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Brandi asks.</p><p>I wipe my tears and wait for her answer.</p><p>\u201cSpa treatments.\u201d She takes her phone and dials a number. \u201cHarold, do that Googly thing and find me a reputable spa in Fremont, Illinois. Make an appointment for three people for a massage and facial tonight.\u201d She hangs up the phone, but then calls back a second later. \u201cOn second thought, make it an appointment for four. Ashtyn\u2019s father is grumpier than I am and definitely needs help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiz, I don\u2019t think my dad will go to a spa,\u201d Brandi says when she hangs up the second time.</p><p>\u201cYes, he will,\u201d Derek\u2019s grandmother says without hesitation. \u201cNobody says no to a Worthington. And if you call me Liz again, I might just have to rip those overly dyed extensions out of your head.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 51</p><p>Derek</p><p>Ashtyn told me I needed a goal. I finally have one, although it\u2019s not really a goal but a mission. I\u2019ve decided to clean the shed before I leave. It was dirty and neglected when I first arrived here, but I gave it new life. I\u2019d already given it a paint job and fixed the broken slats on the roof and walls. This morning I decided to clean the inside of the shed so it\u2019ll look brand-spankin\u2019-new. I cleared out everything, and then went to the hardware store to buy new shelves that won\u2019t fall off the wall and plywood to replace the old floor. I even tiled the top of the workbench so it was clean and usable again.</p><p>I saw Ashtyn leave the house this morning with Victor, who picked her up for practice. She\u2019s not talking to me. Julian isn\u2019t, either. I told him I\u2019d come visit him every few months, but that didn\u2019t matter. He told me to leave him alone and he hasn\u2019t looked at me since. That was two days ago.</p><p>I stand back and survey my progress. \u201cNot bad for a day\u2019s worth of work.\u201d Falkor, panting beside me while vigorously wagging his tail, obviously agrees with me.</p><p>\u201cWhat in God\u2019s name are you doing, Derek?\u201d my grandmother bellows from the porch. She walks over to me in the grass that needs to be mowed again. At least the backyard isn\u2019t a large patch of weeds and looks halfway decent.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m cleanin\u2019 out the shed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHire someone to do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy hire someone when I can do it myself?\u201d</p><p>She holds up a powerful finger. \u201cBecause it helps the economy. When you hire someone, they have more money to buy things. It\u2019s basic economics, Derek.\u201d</p><p>I have to give my grandmother credit for creativity. She really does believe the nonsense that spurts from her lips.</p><p>\u201cWell, basically I\u2019m doin\u2019 it myself,\u201d I tell her.</p><p>She sighs. \u201cWell, fine. Just . . . wash up afterward so you don\u2019t look like a street person.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I laugh as she walks away. To be honest, my grandmother is damn entertaining, and every now and then she does something that reminds me of my mom\u2014like the way she sleeps on the very edge of her bed or the way she covers her mouth when she laughs. On the other hand, when she acts like a high-class snob, it\u2019s completely annoying and embarrassing. While she intends to turn me into a clone of her while I live in her house for the next nine months until I graduate, my intention is to take the snobbery out of her. It\u2019ll be a challenge, that\u2019s for damn sure.</p><p>At five o\u2019clock, my grandmother announces that she\u2019s taking the whole family into the city for dinner. Supposedly she made reservations at The Pump Room, which she said is some fancy place where celebrities in Chicago eat. Gus has learned in the past two days that it\u2019s better to follow my grandmother\u2019s orders than to fight her. I think she\u2019s what he needed all along, a crazy lady to make him interact with the family instead of escaping it. I would go, but to be honest, looking at Ashtyn all night across a table and knowing I\u2019m leaving her in a few days isn\u2019t what I\u2019d call a fun evening.</p><p>I\u2019ve managed to clean out the entire shed when it\u2019s suddenly dark outside. I get a flashlight from the house and put the shelves up, then hang all the tools back on the wall.</p><p>\u201cStop, or I\u2019m calling the police!\u201d a familiar feminine voice says from behind me.</p> <p>Ashtyn is standing in the doorway, holding her signature pitchfork like it\u2019s a weapon. It\u2019s dark, but the small glow of the flashlight shines on the metal in her hands.</p><p>I give her a small smile and walk up to the pitchfork so it\u2019s an inch away from my chest. \u201cYou really don\u2019t want to stab me,\u201d I tell her.</p><p>She lowers the weapon. \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>I take the pitchfork out of her hand and toss it outside, far away from my foot. \u201cWhat are you doin\u2019 here? I thought you\u2019d gone with everyone else to the city.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI decided to stay.\u201d There\u2019s no mistaking the seductive tone of her voice.</p> <p>She steps closer. From the small amount of light, I can tell she\u2019s wearing a hockey jersey and nothing else. My eyes rake over her half-clad body, unable to look away.</p><p>I swallow, hard. It\u2019s dark and the flashlight is losing battery fast. When I met Ashtyn, I had no clue what she\u2019d do to me. Every time I\u2019m near her, I want to push her away and pull her close at the same time. She talks like a jock but has a body like an angel. She knows I\u2019m leaving, but she\u2019s here with me now . . .</p><p>\u201cWhy did you stay home tonight?\u201d I ask.</p><p>The flashlight flickers, then it goes completely dark when she reaches out for me and whispers in my ear, \u201cBecause of you.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 52</p><p>Ashtyn</p> <p>I sat on my bed for an hour before I gathered enough nerve to come to the shed tonight. I know Derek\u2019s leaving, but I want him to remember what it felt like to be with someone who loved him unconditionally. I tell myself not to be emotional, to be happy that we could have this one last night together. I never imagined I\u2019d fall so hard for someone, especially after knowing him for such a short time, but I have.</p><p>I never believed in love at first sight, until I met Derek. It\u2019s all-consuming and delicious and wonderful and exciting. At the same time, it makes me nervous and self-conscious and emotional. Love exists. I know it does, because I\u2019m madly, deeply, hopelessly in love.</p><p>Wrapping my arms around Derek\u2019s neck, I feel his hands on my waist as he pulls me close. We kiss, and I open my mouth to deepen the intimacy. His tongue is lost in my mouth and mine in his.</p><p>\u201cOnce we start this, I\u2019m not gonna want to stop,\u201d he says in a hoarse, deep voice.</p><p>\u201cMe neither.\u201d</p><p>Without another word, I close my eyes while his fingers hook onto the bottom of my jersey, and slowly, tantalizingly, he slips the material over my sensitive skin and tosses it aside.</p><p>It\u2019s dark. We can\u2019t see anything, but I can hear the sexy rasp of his breathing and feel the slow, sensual feel of his hands on my skin.</p><p>I reach out and roam my fingers over the muscles of his biceps and trace the hard, solid lines of his perfect, defined abs and pecs. \u201cI lied to you,\u201d I tell him as my fingers move over the waistband of his shorts and follow the line of hair that leads downward.</p> <p>\u201cMmm . . .\u2019bout what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said I wasn\u2019t affected or impressed by your body.\u201d I kiss his neck and the musky scent of maleness envelops my senses. I move my kisses lower, to his chest, his abs, and lower. \u201cI lied.\u201d</p><p>He throws his head back, and his hand weaves into my hair as I show him how much I appreciate his body. From the ragged sound of his breathing I know he likes it. A lot.</p><p>\u201cMy turn,\u201d he says in a strained voice after a while. I let out a surprised shriek when he scoops me up and has me sit on the empty new workbench in front of him.</p><p>He kisses me senseless and I move against him, wanting more, wanting him, wanting this night to last forever. Our bodies are slick with sweat now, and we\u2019re both panting and struggling to make this last longer, but I sense we\u2019re both holding on by a thin thread. My hands roam over his glorious body while I taste his mouth and he tastes mine.</p><p>He replaces his mouth with the tip of his forefinger, lightly moving it over my lips before dipping his finger inside my mouth so I can suck on it.</p><p>I lean back while he removes his finger from my mouth and moves it gently and passionately over my body. At some point his finger gets replaced by his mouth and tongue. When I feel his hot breath on my slick skin, my entire body tingles.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing to me,\u201d I pant.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I do,\u201d he says in a hoarse, deep voice as he removes the rest of his clothes. I hear the rip of a condom wrapper and my body goes still.</p><p>\u201cDid you get that from your wallet?\u201d I ask him.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you didn\u2019t carry a condom in your wallet.\u201d</p><p>He chuckles, and I can imagine his lips are curved into a mischievous grin. \u201cSecret compartment.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m sitting on the edge of the workbench as he stands between my legs and slips on a condom.</p><p>I brace my hands on his chest. \u201cDerek?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d he says, his voice strained as he holds himself back.</p><p>I\u2019m glad it\u2019s dark, and he can\u2019t see my face now, all hot and bothered and nervous. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing.\u201d</p><p>He puts my hand on him so I can feel his arousal. \u201cObviously, you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I mean I\u2019ve done stuff before . . . but not . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? I had no idea.\u201d He lets out a long, slow breath before placing his forehead against mine. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to do this, Ashtyn. Your first time shouldn\u2019t be in a shed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to.\u201d I hold his face in my hands. \u201cI love you, Cowboy. Unconditionally. And this is the perfect place to do it . . . the place we first met. Nothing could be more special with you, right here. Right now.\u201d</p><p>And so we do.</p><p>Derek takes it slow.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d he asks as we move together. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m so overwhelmed and so in the moment it\u2019s hard for me to process it all. It\u2019s like I\u2019m in the middle of a dream and I don\u2019t want to wake up. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about me,\u201d I say in a soft whisper.</p><p>\u201cI always worry about you, Ashtyn. I know you can take care of yourself . . .\u201d He grabs my butt with his hands, urging my legs to wrap around him as he lifts me off the workbench. \u201cBut sometimes it\u2019s way better when you let someone else take care of you. Come with me and let go of your inhibitions, Sugar Pie.\u201d</p><p>I close my eyes while Derek takes over. He\u2019s right. I\u2019ve never felt so loved and cared for in my entire life. He\u2019s so gentle and patient and knows just the right thing to do and suddenly I\u2019m crying out his name and he cries out mine. I know this dream won\u2019t last forever and a part of me will always want him as a permanent fixture in my life.</p><p>\u201cYou own a piece of me,\u201d he murmurs as he holds me afterward.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d I tell him. \u201cAnd just so you know . . . I\u2019m never giving it back.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 53</p><p>Derek</p><p>In the past, I knew what I wanted and went for it with a vengeance. When I was younger, it was football. I did what I had to do in order to be the best.</p><p>The day after Ashtyn and I spent the night together in the shed, I\u2019m on the plane headed back to Texas. My grandmother is sitting across from me with a stoic look on her face. I know she bonded with Brandi, Julian, and Ashtyn. Hell, I even saw her secretly feed Falkor scraps of food under the table when she thought nobody was looking.</p><p>After we land, Harold picks us up.</p><p>\u201cDid you have a nice time?\u201d Harold asks us.</p><p>My grandmother and I look at each other. \u201cThe weather in Chicago is atrociously hot and humid,\u201d she says in a haughty tone. \u201cBut Fremont is a charming town. With people who grew on me, I suppose. Right, Derek?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I say.</p><p>I enter my grandmother\u2019s house and it just doesn\u2019t feel right. It\u2019s too big and too empty. At night, I stare at the stark white walls and know this isn\u2019t where I want to be.</p><p>Before the sun comes up, I walk downstairs and am surprised to find my grandmother sitting in the library all by herself. She\u2019s got my mom\u2019s letter in her hand.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t sleep?\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head and puts the letter down. \u201cIt\u2019s not for lack of trying. What about you, Derek?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t sleep, either.\u201d I sit next to her. \u201cYou miss my mom?\u201d</p><p>She nods. \u201cYes. Very much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d I look at my grandmother and for the first time since my mom died, I realize what I want. I want to be there for Julian and Brandi, the family I never knew I wanted. I want to be close to my grandmother even though she drives me nuts. I want to show Ashtyn what it means to be loved unconditionally\u2014because she\u2019s the only girl I want to be with and I don\u2019t ever want her to feel alone again.</p><p>I want to fight for her. And go for it with a vengeance.</p><p>It\u2019s been a long time since I set a plan in motion, other than a stupid prank, but that competitive instinct kicks in as if it were never gone in the first place. I feel excitement and blood rushing through my veins as I plot out what I need to do. It won\u2019t be easy\u2014far from it. But I welcome the challenge.</p><p>\u201cGrams?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Derek. Did I ever tell you that I hate when you call me that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a term of endearment, because I love you,\u201d I tell her, getting me a jab in the ribs. \u201cI want to go back to Chicago. And I want you to come with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a Texan, Derek,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cMe, too. Think we can be Texans who just happen to live somewhere else?\u201d</p><p>She thinks about it for a minute, then nods. \u201cYes. Yes, I think we can give it a whirl and try it. I\u2019ll have Harold help us find a decent house to live in that\u2019s not too far from Brandi and Ashtyn. Of course Harold and the staff will relocate with us . . . and I have to come back periodically to oversee Worthington Industries. You know you\u2019re the heir to the company, don\u2019t you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou keep reminding me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>This is more than fixing the mistakes I made in the past. This is bringing purpose back into my life, something I\u2019d been missing. Ashtyn knew I had fight left in me . . . and she helped me realize that I have goals and dreams just like she does.</p><p>My grandmother is more than happy to help set my plans in motion. It takes a bunch of calls to some universities and coaches I once played with, and pulling some strings that only an heir of Worthington Industries can pull off. I fly back to Chicago when I know Ashtyn\u2019s got her interview at Northwestern University. I know she won\u2019t be at practice. As soon as I land, I head over to Fremont High.</p> <p>I walk on the field, and the familiar scent of fresh-cut grass envelops me. The coach is in an intense conversation with one of the assistant coaches. \u201cCoach Dieter,\u201d I say, jogging to catch up with him.</p><p>The coach turns around, his sharp blue eyes giving me a onceover. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>I swallow. Suddenly I\u2019m nervous. How could my nerves be wound tight just by talking to a small-town coach? Probably because in the back of my mind, I know this is it and I can\u2019t turn back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a transfer student,\u201d I tell Dieter. \u201cI\u2019m startin\u2019 here in the fall and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSon, I haven\u2019t got all day. State your business.\u201d</p> <p>I tell him, straight up, \u201cI want to play ball. Quarterback.\u201d</p><p>He chuckles.</p><p>\u201cListen, I know you lost McKnight and your backup isn\u2019t exactly starter material.\u201d I can\u2019t afford to show any weakness, only determination and confidence. \u201cI\u2019ll be better than McKnight on his best day.\u201d</p><p>Coach Dieter\u2019s eyebrows rise. \u201cYou sure are a cocky sonofa-bitch. What\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><p>I hold out my hand. \u201cDerek. Derek Fitzpatrick.\u201d</p><p>The coach takes my hand and shakes it. It\u2019s a manly shake, one of those hard ones that tests the strength of another guy and it\u2019s over before you know it.</p> <p>\u201cWhere\u2019d you play?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStarted in Alabama, then played at Sierra High in California. State champion, all-state player\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat year are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be a senior.\u201d</p><p>Dieter calls over one of the assistant coaches. \u201cDerek Fitzpatrick, this is our DC, Coach Heilmann. Coach Heilmann, Derek here thinks he\u2019s a better QB than Landon McKnight.\u201d</p><p>The defensive coordinator gives a short laugh, then shrugs. \u201cWhat the hell. I\u2019d give him a tryout, Bill. At this point it can\u2019t hurt,\u201d the assistant coach says before leaving us alone again.</p><p>Dieter taps his pen on his clipboard. \u201cWhat can hurt is egomaniac wannabes wasting my time.\u201d Before I can tell him about my stats, he says, \u201cFollow me, son. Let\u2019s get you suited up and see what you got.\u201d</p><p>I follow the coach into the locker room, where the rest of the team is putting on their gear. He motions for me to wait outside the equipment cage while he grabs me pads and a helmet. After he hands them to me, I sit on a bench and check out my future teammates.</p> <p>I catch sight of Victor immediately. He takes one look at me and storms up, facing me head-on with fierce hatred on his face. \u201cGet the fuck out of here, Fitzpatrick. You think you can hurt Ashtyn, then suddenly have a change of heart and expect her to run back in your arms so you can take advantage of her again? That\u2019s bullshit, man. I don\u2019t trust you, and neither does anyone else on this team, so you might as well go back to where you came from.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not goin\u2019 anywhere,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah? You want to get to Ashtyn, you\u2019ve got to get through every single one of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d Whatever it takes. I\u2019m not backing down.</p><p>He pushes me. I push back.</p><p>We\u2019re about to get into it when Dieter blows his whistle. Everybody stops what they\u2019re doing and suddenly the entire locker room is quiet. All eyes are on me. Obviously if Victor considers me the enemy, they all consider me the enemy.</p><p>\u201cEveryone on the field!\u201d Dieter yells.</p><p>Shit, this is not going to be easy.</p><p>Jet pushes my helmet off the bench. \u201cDon\u2019t expect any one of us to kiss your ass or fawn all over you because you\u2019re supposed to be some sort of master QB and all. We all watched Ashtyn cry for days after you left. It was fucked-up, \u2019cause she never gets that emotional. You got a death wish, this is the right place.\u201d</p><p>When I run on the field after suiting up, Victor walks right up to Dieter. \u201cWe want Butter in as QB, Coach.\u201d</p><p>Dieter doesn\u2019t even look up from his clipboard. \u201cI\u2019m not planning anything but a winning season. From my experience, there\u2019s nothin\u2019 like shaking things up to make a team stronger. Maybe a new QB will light a fire under your asses.\u201d</p><p>Victor is getting riled up now, because he\u2019s breathing hard and his fist is clenched on to the face mask of his helmet hanging at his side. \u201cCoach\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSalazar, stop whining. Now get your ass over to calisthenics. You, too, Fitzpatrick.\u201d</p><p>Victor stalks over to the field where the rest of the team is doing jumping jacks. Dieter grabs my elbow as I walk past him. \u201cHe\u2019s not gonna make it easy for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not used to things coming easy,\u201d I say.</p><p>I better keep my mind on the game and not the girl who has invaded my thoughts and my life.</p><p>During practice, I\u2019m ordered to shadow the current QB, Brandon Butter. After he runs a play, Dieter sidelines him and tells me to call the same play. My handoff to Trey Matthews is textbook, but he drops the ball as soon as his hands touch the leather.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d I ask Trey after he drops the ball a second time. \u201cThat was a textbook handoff.\u201d</p><p>He starts walking away. \u201cFor a prodigy, your skills are obviously lacking,\u201d he mumbles, then crudely grabs his crotch for my benefit.</p><p>\u201cFuck you. My skills are spot-on.\u201d</p><p>Jet isn\u2019t any help, either. He tries his hardest to catch the current QB\u2019s throws every time, even when they\u2019re way off target, but he practically runs in the opposite direction the second the ball leaves my hand.</p><p>The guys on the offensive line leave a hole wide open for Victor to sack me. He does, repeatedly.</p><p>\u201cDude, you suck!\u201d Victor says to me when we\u2019re getting in formation. He chuckles, amused at my inability to show off my skills.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t suck if your teammates would do their job,\u201d I yell.</p><p>As the ball is hiked to me, I look for Jet but am immediately sacked by Victor again. None of my offensive linemen are protecting me.</p><p>\u201cThat was for Ashtyn,\u201d Victor says, shoving me to the ground as I try to get up. Then he puts a hand out to help me, but I don\u2019t take it. It\u2019s his damn fault I got sacked. With my frustration at an all-time high, I stand up and push him. He\u2019s a linebacker. I shouldn\u2019t be surprised that his feet stay solid on the ground.</p><p>\u201cWant a piece of me?\u201d he asks.</p><p>Jet appears between us. He grabs the front of my jersey and urges me away from Vic.</p><p>It\u2019s too late. \u201cGive me what you got, Salazar.\u201d</p><p>I brace myself and keep my center of gravity as he attempts to shove me to the ground. Ha. The big guy thought he\u2019d take me down without an effort, but I\u2019m one stubborn motherfucker, my adrenaline is running high, and I refuse to be taken down. Frustrated, he removes his helmet and gets in my face. Dieter blows his whistle. I think he\u2019s been blowing it ever since I got sacked, but I\u2019m ignoring it just like everyone else at this point.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t expect to come here, snap your fingers, and make us work for you,\u201d Salazar says.</p><p>I whip off my helmet. \u201cI\u2019ve played with freshmen who could run circles around you.\u201d</p><p>He rushes me just as Coach Dieter blows his whistle again. It\u2019s not easy to fight with equipment on. We\u2019re rolling on the ground trying to get at each other.</p><p>\u201cBreak it up!\u201d I hear Dieter yelling.</p><p>A bunch of guys force us off each other.</p><p>\u201cFitzpatrick, on the bench!\u201d Dieter orders, motioning to the sidelines.</p><p>What the hell? I\u2019m being singled out? Fuck that. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kiddin\u2019. Coach, it wasn\u2019t my\u2014\u201d</p><p>Dieter points to the bench, cutting me off. \u201cI\u2019m not gonna say it again.\u201d</p><p>This team . . . these assholes . . . are fucking up my chance. I sit on the bench, seething from every pore of my body as the players put in 110 percent for Butter even though he sucks.</p><p>\u201cFitzpatrick, get your butt over here!\u201d Coach Dieter yells from across the field. \u201cThe rest of you, take a lap around the field, then you\u2019re dismissed.\u201d</p><p>I grab my helmet and walk over to the coach. \u201cI didn\u2019t come here to be sidelined.\u201d I can\u2019t hide my frustration.</p><p>\u201cListen, Derek, despite what happened on the field I can tell you\u2019ve got a good arm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf the team\u2019ll back me up\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t.\u201d He takes his hat off and leans forward. \u201cI can tell them until my face is blue, but for some reason the guys don\u2019t trust you. My boys\u2019ll take a hit to protect Butter even if it means breakin\u2019 their bones to do it. You need to earn their respect and loyalty. Once you do that, we\u2019ve got a real good shot this year. It\u2019s up to you. You up for the challenge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Coach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Now go do damage control and fix whatever drama is happening off the field, then meet me back here for practice Monday morning.\u201d</p><p>In the parking lot, Salazar is about to get on his motorcycle. He stiffens when he sees me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m tryin\u2019 to get Ashtyn back,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>\u201cGood luck with that,\u201d he says with a shake of his head. \u201cNot gonna happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDammit, Salazar . . .\u201d Time to let it all out, because there might not be a second chance at this. \u201cI love her.\u201d I open my arms out wide. \u201cWhy do you think I\u2019m doin\u2019 all this? It\u2019s for her, it\u2019s for us, it\u2019s for me. Shit, I don\u2019t know. Maybe you\u2019re right and I\u2019m the biggest asshole who ever walked the earth. But you know more than anyone how she feels about me. If I have a remote chance of winnin\u2019 her back . . . I\u2019ve got to do this. Hell, I don\u2019t blame you for wantin\u2019 to beat the shit out of me. She wants a winning team, Salazar. I want to help give that to her. Help me give that to her.\u201d</p><p>He lowers his head and sighs. \u201cYou hurt her, Fitzpatrick. She cried in my arms like a fuckin\u2019 baby, man. She\u2019s like a sister to me and I will not let you hurt her again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t intend to. I hate to ask you this, but I need your help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to borrow tapes of every game Fremont\u2019s played for the past three years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery game?\u201d Victor narrows his eyes like he did that first day we met. He looked at me like I was the enemy on a rival team. \u201cShould I trust you?\u201d</p><p>I look him straight in the eye and say, \u201cNo. But I\u2019d really appreciate it if you did.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 54</p><p>Ashtyn </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I take a deep breath as I sit in front of the coaching staff at Northwestern. It\u2019s considered the Ivy League school of the Midwest and one of the best football programs. I attended a seminar about the school and took an all-day tour of the campus. It\u2019s beautiful here, right on the shores of Lake Michigan. I can\u2019t help but wish Derek were here to say you can do this.</p><p>Derek. As much as I try to push the memories of us together to the back of my mind, I can\u2019t. He\u2019s become a part of me, whether he feels the same about me or not. When I close my eyes and think about him gently touching my face, running his hand through my hair, or just holding me because he knows I need to be held, I actually feel a calmness I haven\u2019t felt since my mom left.</p><p>I want to fly to Texas, grab him, and tell him how much I want him to choose me. But if I do, I won\u2019t be letting him choose his own path. I don\u2019t want to ever feel like I forced or coerced him to be with me. He obviously wasn\u2019t ready for a commitment, at least with me. I just want him to be happy. If he\u2019s happy without me in Texas, I need to be okay with it.</p><p>Who am I kidding? I\u2019ll never be okay with it, and I miss him so damn bad. He\u2019s my best friend, the one who taught me that I\u2019m worthy of being loved. He made me feel confident that my mom was the one who was losing out.</p> <p>For the first time in my life, I actually believe it.</p><p>\u201cWhile we\u2019re impressed with your performance last year and you received a wonderful recommendation from Coach Bennett at Elite and Coach Dieter at Fremont, we\u2019re just not ready to offer you any kind of assistance or a scholarship,\u201d the coach says. \u201cWe have a lot of kickers to consider, Ashtyn. You\u2019re on our watch list, but to be honest, there\u2019s a bunch of players ahead of you and we want to be realistic. But we thank you for your time and interest in Northwestern. It\u2019s a great school, and we\u2019d love to have you as a student here.\u201d</p><p>I nod, thank them for considering me, and the meeting is over in a matter of minutes. Once I\u2019m back in the elevator on my way down to the first floor, a deep pang of sorrow settles into my chest at the realization that one door is closed.</p><p>They don\u2019t think I\u2019m good enough.</p><p>When the elevator opens, I hear a familiar cranky old lady say in a commanding voice, \u201cI\u2019m telling you that I don\u2019t need an appointment with the coach! I need to see him now.\u201d</p> <p>Derek\u2019s grandmother is wielding her umbrella like a sword in front of the doorman\u2019s face. The woman looks ready to slice the doorman in two, or at least whack him on the head if she doesn\u2019t get her way.</p><p>\u201cMa\u2019am, it\u2019s against policy to let you in the elevator without an appointment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are obviously a nincompoop when it comes to recognizing authority,\u201d Elizabeth Worthington barks out, frustration and agitation laced in her voice. \u201cNow get out of my way so I can see my . . .\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Worthington lowers her umbrella and clears her throat the second she sees me. \u201cHello, Ashtyn.\u201d</p><p>Just being in the same room with the old lady, even when she\u2019s threatening someone, is supremely comforting. \u201cMrs. Worthington, what are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis heathen doorman has vexed me to no end,\u201d she says. She sighs in annoyance while she reaches into the purse hanging from her forearm and pulls out a monogrammed handkerchief. She dabs invisible sweat off her forehead.</p> <p>It doesn\u2019t escape my attention that she hasn\u2019t answered my question. It\u2019s a habit she obviously picked up from her grandson. Or maybe it\u2019s hereditary, and they were both born with the trait.</p><p>But I\u2019m not about to let her off the hook. \u201cI thought you went back to Texas. What are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Worthington places her handkerchief back in her purse and pulls out a clean one. \u201cThat, my dear, is a very good question.\u201d She clears her throat again and says, \u201cQuite honestly, Ashtyn, I heard you were here and I came back to be here for you. I\u2019ve got a car outside waiting to take you home.\u201d</p><p>Me?</p><p>She came here for me?</p><p>Nobody comes back for me. They leave me, just like my sister, my mom, and Landon . . . even Derek, the one person who mattered most. But this old, cranky lady with a bad attitude came back for me.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that,\u201d she orders.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I whisper, my voice trembling.</p> <p>The old lady pulls me aside and shoos the doorman away. She unfolds the clean monogrammed handkerchief and starts wiping tears from my face. \u201cYou\u2019re just a complete mess, and, well, you\u2019re pretty much hopeless and need guidance. I figure I\u2019m the only one capable of turning you into a lady of any substance.\u201d</p><p>I still her shaky hand as she wipes fresh tears falling from my eyes. \u201cI love you, too.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes are welling up as more tears stream down my face, but she blinks them back and composes herself. \u201cStop blubbering, because now you\u2019re turning me into a mess and I won\u2019t have it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I called you a snob.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t call me a snob.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought it.\u201d</p><p>She purses her lips and taps her umbrella on the ground like a cane. \u201cWell . . . truth is, I probably am a snob. Now let\u2019s get in my car and head back home, but first we need to eat lunch. I\u2019m hungry.\u201d</p><p>A limo is waiting outside for her . . . for us. I sit across from her and notice her smirking, that same smirk that Derek has when he\u2019s being mischievous.</p><p>Later that evening, Brandi and Mrs. Worthington go out for dinner while I babysit Julian. After I put Julian to bed and am in my room talking to Victor about my interview at Northwestern, Julian comes in the room wearing his little pajamas with cartoon characters on them.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t sleep,\u201d he says shyly as he stands next to my bed.</p><p>I hang up with Victor and look at my nephew. \u201cWant to come sleep in my bed?\u201d</p><p>He nods.</p><p>I lift my comforter and he climbs inside. He\u2019s sucking his thumb while his other hand wraps around me.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Julian,\u201d I say as I kiss the top of his head.</p><p>He takes his thumb out of his mouth and looks up at me with adoring eyes. \u201cI love you, too, Auntie Ashtyn.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 55</p><p>Derek</p><p>I\u2019ve never been nervous before a game. A calmness would come over me and I was able to block out all insecurities and self-doubt. I was able to focus entirely on the game. I had an overabundance of confidence that I\u2019d win. And I did.</p><p>I never thought there was a chance that I would lose.</p><p>But now, as I walk up to the house and see the shed in the backyard, I think about the odds against me. The thrill of anticipation makes me sweat. What if I end up losing her? And as much as I keep telling myself I need to have confidence, I\u2019m filled with self-doubt.</p><p>Everything I set up is in place, except for one thing.</p><p>I ring the doorbell, but nobody answers, so I walk into the house. Gus is sitting in his big leather chair, watching television. I sit on the couch, pick up the remote, and turn off the television.</p><p>Gus turns to me. \u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing? I thought you moved to Texas with that bossy grandmother of yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to talk to you, Gus. It\u2019s important.\u201d I put the remote back on the table.</p><p>The man sits up straighter in his chair and rests his hands on his stomach. \u201cWhat do you want, Derek?\u201d He glances at his watch. \u201cYou\u2019ve got exactly three minutes.\u201d</p><p>For a long time I didn\u2019t care what people thought. Suddenly everything matters. Even if Ashtyn doesn\u2019t think her father\u2019s approval is important, it is. Probably more than she wants to admit.</p><p>I wipe my forehead and take a deep breath. I rehearsed what I was going to say, but all those words are forgotten. I look at Ashtyn\u2019s father, always looking glum, and clear my throat. \u201cI\u2019ve developed feelings for Ashtyn, sir.\u201d</p><p>He raises an eyebrow. \u201cSince when?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor a while now.\u201d</p><p>He gives me a hard, cold stare. \u201cYou asking for my approval?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir. Not that I need it, but I sure would appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>He looks me up and down, then sits back in his chair and sighs. \u201cI haven\u2019t done right by her. If her mother was here, Brandi wouldn\u2019t have left and Ashtyn wouldn\u2019t have played football. I thought if I didn\u2019t make a big deal about it, she\u2019d decide to quit. I failed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou still have a chance to make it up to her, Gus. She needs you. She\u2019s a strong, independent girl who\u2019ll fight for what she wants, but you\u2019d make it a helluva lot easier for her if you were there to cheer her on. If you\u2019d watch her, you\u2019d see that she\u2019s a great football player. I cherish her, sir. More than anythin\u2019. And I\u2019m gonna be by her side whether you\u2019re there or not.\u201d</p><p>Gus nods. I think I just got his approval, but I\u2019m not sure. It\u2019ll have to be enough.</p><p>I go back to Victor\u2019s house and change clothes. It\u2019s time. It\u2019s the fourth quarter and it\u2019s the last play of the game . . . in the Super Bowl of my life.</p><p>Chapter 56</p><p>Ashtyn</p><p>Mrs. Worthington is the slowest eater I\u2019ve ever met. She insisted we go to a grill across the street from Millennium Park for lunch. The woman takes a bite of her burger and chews until her food is completely decimated before taking another bite. She keeps glancing at her watch every two seconds, like she\u2019s timing her bites. I just want to go home so I can close my eyes and pretend Derek is coming back. I know it\u2019s useless.</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019ve decided to rent a house in that Godforsaken town of yours,\u201d Mrs. Worthington says, then takes another bite.</p><p>Wait, I\u2019m confused. \u201cYou\u2019re moving to Fremont?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you that you\u2019d be hopeless without me.\u201d She gestures to my ears. \u201cYou should listen better, or get those ears of yours tested. You\u2019re family to me now. Contrary to popular belief, I look after my family. No offense, but your sister\u2019s a flake and your father could use a little pep in his step. Y\u2019all need a little Texas influence, if you ask me.\u201d</p><p>This old lady is moving here to be with us, to keep an eye on us, and to make sure we\u2019re taken care of. Just the thought of it brings a tear to my eye. \u201cWhat about Derek?\u201d</p><p>She rolls her keen blue eyes that remind me of Derek\u2019s. \u201cMy grandson is a wild card. I can\u2019t keep up with him. One day he\u2019s moving to Texas, the next he\u2019s going back to California. For all I know he\u2019ll end up here in Chicago.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t tell her that\u2019s not about to happen. It hurts like crazy to admit it, but Derek made his decision to leave and he isn\u2019t coming back. I give her a small smile.</p><p>She checks her watch again. \u201cI\u2019ve got to go to the ladies\u2019 room. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d She takes her purple sun umbrella off the back of the chair.</p><p>\u201cDo you need help?\u201d I ask, wondering why she\u2019d need her umbrella to go to the restroom.</p><p>She waves the tip of it in my direction. \u201cI might be an old lady, but I can surely get to the restroom without an escort.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve already learned that arguing with Mrs. Worthington is useless. She heads to the restroom and I stare down at my burger. I ordered the one made with meat from grass-fed cows. Derek would be proud of me for my healthy choice. He has no clue how my life has been altered because of him. Everything I say or do brings up a memory of the time we spent together. Will the gnawing pain in my heart ever go away, or will I have a gaping wound in it the rest of my life? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>In time I\u2019ll be okay, but I\u2019ve resolved myself to the fact that I\u2019ll always have an ache in my heart that only Derek can heal.</p><p>A random woman with long brown hair sits in the chair opposite me, right in front of Mrs. Worthington\u2019s burger. I\u2019m completely caught off guard. I\u2019m about to tell her the seat is obviously taken, when recognition sinks in.</p><p>No. Way! It can\u2019t be . . .</p><p>\u201cKatie Calhoun?\u201d I blurt out.</p> <p>She takes a French fry off Mrs. Worthington\u2019s plate. \u201cSo I hear Northwestern didn\u2019t offer you a football scholarship. That\u2019s too bad.\u201d</p><p>My mouth is wide open in shock. I couldn\u2019t talk even if I tried.</p><p>\u201cListen, Ashtyn,\u201d Katie says. \u201cCan I be real honest with you?\u201d</p><p>I nod slowly, still in shock.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t give up.\u201d She takes another fry and wags it at me as she says, \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how many people thought I would quit, but I never did. And even when I didn\u2019t get the full support of my teammates, I never gave up.\u201d She leans in and whispers, \u201cI think you\u2019re stronger than you think. So does Derek.\u201d</p> <p>Derek? Slowly the realization that he had something to do with Katie Calhoun being here settles in my brain. \u201cHe set this up, didn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>She nods, then turns her chair around. \u201cWatch the monitor,\u201d she says, pointing to the TV in the bar showing ESPN highlights.</p><p>Katie nods to the bartender, which is some sort of cue, but I have no clue what\u2019s going on. Suddenly, the TV screens go blank. Then, all of a sudden, \u201cASHTYN PARKER HIGHLIGHT REEL\u201d comes on the screen, then fades out.</p><p>Highlight reel? But I don\u2019t have a highlight . . .</p><p>My eyes start to water and my heart does a little flip when footage of me playing my freshman year appears. Then footage of my sophomore year . . . and junior year. I watch each clip of me successfully kicking field goal after field goal, many times being rushed by my teammates afterward as they congratulate me.</p><p>Derek did this. He spent time going through every game and took snippets of my most memorable games. He even set the reel to music.</p> <p>When the screen fades to black, I think it\u2019s over. Until the word \u201cDEDICATED\u201d comes on the screen and footage of me practicing during our road trip to Texas comes up. My hand flies to my mouth in shock. Derek wasn\u2019t playing games or texting when I was practicing. He was filming me with his cell phone while I yelled at him practically the entire time.</p><p>At the end, the screen is filled with the words \u201cASHTYN PARKER, KICKER.\u201d</p><p>Everyone claps for me. This was all set up by Derek. How did he find Katie Calhoun? How did he get her to come here? Why?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re talented, Ashtyn. I\u2019m impressed,\u201d Katie says. After giving me a pep talk and answering a bunch of questions, she stands up.</p><p>\u201cDo you know where Mrs. Worthington went?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s at the bar.\u201d Katie waves to the old lady. Mrs. Worthington waves back with her umbrella.</p><p>While I\u2019m still reeling in shock, Katie sets an envelope on the table and slides it in front of me.</p><p>\u201cGood luck, Ashtyn,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ll be rooting for you.\u201d</p> <p>Katie walks out. Nobody else in the restaurant knows who she is, even though she\u2019s one of the few females who\u2019ve played football at the college level. She\u2019s a pioneer, a legend.</p><p>My fingers glide over the envelope. In Derek\u2019s handwriting it says, After you read this, go across the street to The Bean.</p><p>The Bean is this big silver metal sculpture in Millennium Park. I look over at Mrs. Worthington, who holds up our check and gestures for me to leave.</p><p>I shove the letter in my pocket and rush out of the restaurant. All I want to do is run up to Derek and wrap my arms around him. Surely he\u2019s here, by The Bean. It takes every ounce of energy for me not to run into the crowded city streets. I wait for the light with everyone else by the sidewalk, craning my neck.</p><p>I don\u2019t see him.</p><p>I rush across the street with the rest of the pedestrians when the light changes, while frantically searching for signs of the boy who suddenly has a goal . . . and I hope that goal is to be with me.</p><p>I told Derek to go for what he wanted, full force, and he did. The truth envelops me. I thought he left me, when all along he did what he thought he needed to do to prove how much he cares about me.</p><p>When I get to The Bean, my sister, Julian, Falkor, and my dad are standing in front of it. Julian has a box of Skittles in his hand, which he holds out to me.</p><p>\u201cDerek told me to give you this,\u201d he says. \u201cOpen it.\u201d</p><p>I open the box and peek inside. There are no purple ones.</p><p>Brandi points to a tree in the distance. \u201cWe\u2019re supposed to tell you to wait by that tree over there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d I ask.</p><p>My dad shrugs.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Derek?\u201d I ask. I just need to see him, to talk to him, to say I\u2019m ready to fight for him, for us. Together we can make this work. If I wait any longer, I swear I\u2019m going to explode.</p><p>But neither my sister, my nephew, nor my dad is giving me any hints, so I follow their directions. When I get to the tree, there\u2019s a bunch of purple Skittles arranged in a big purple heart.</p><p>\u201cYo, Ashtyn!\u201d Derek\u2019s voice echoes from across the park. \u201cHeads up!\u201d</p><p>Derek appears all the way across the park, wearing a Fremont High football uniform, complete with helmet and pads. In his hands is a football.</p><p>With expert precision, he tosses the football to me. It flies right into my waiting hands, but I\u2019m too nervous and drop it.</p><p>He takes off the helmet. \u201cYou fumbled,\u201d he says with a grin. He jogs the distance between us so he\u2019s standing in front of me now, taking my breath away as I look into his mischievous, sparkling eyes and his gorgeous, chiseled features.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was a perfect throw,\u201d he tells me. He threw that ball from way across the park, practically across the street and between a ton of people. And it was completely on target. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you catch it, Sugar Pie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m nervous and my heart is beating like crazy.\u201d</p><p>The side of his mouth quirks up.</p><p>I take in the football player in front of me. But he\u2019s not a football player. Maybe he was in the past, but that was before his mom died. I\u2019m not going to push him into playing again. He told me his decision not to play was final, so . . . \u201cWhat are you doing wearing that jersey and all that equipment, Derek? Why are you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI joined the team.\u201d He shrugs. \u201cI figure that\u2019s the only way I can spend time with my girlfriend. She\u2019s the kicker for Fremont, you know. And she\u2019s a damn good one at that.\u201d</p><p>I reach up and touch his gorgeous face. \u201cThank you for making the highlight reel. And for finding Katie Calhoun. I have no clue how you did it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just say your teammates like their captain a lot.\u201d He stills my hand with his own. \u201cWhat about the letter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe letter?\u201d I fish it out of my pocket and hold it up. \u201cI haven\u2019t read it yet.\u201d Finding Derek was more important than anything.</p><p>He motions for me to open it. I rip open the envelope and slide the letter out. When I read the words on the paper, the realization of what he did this past week hits me.</p><p>I lower the letter and look up at Derek. \u201cYou got me an offer from a Division I school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You got an offer from a Division I school. I just sent the highlight reel.\u201d He kicks the ground. \u201cAnd made a couple of calls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did it for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAshtyn Parker, I\u2019d do anythin\u2019 for you.\u201d He cups my head in his hands and leans in close. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what this means, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you have to fight to be first string. Right now Brandon Butter\u2019s got the top spot. I can\u2019t be dating the second-string quarterback. I have a reputation to protect, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have faith in me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I have no doubt you can do it. After all, Cowboy, you did the impossible and made me fall in love with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe impossible, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>He laughs. \u201cFrom what I remember, you melted the first time you laid eyes on me in the shed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re rewriting history, Derek. I seem to remember that I stabbed you the first time I laid eyes on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you were struck by The Fitz\u2019s good looks and charm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet over yourself. I thought you looked like a thug. And if you refer to yourself in third person as The Fitz again, we\u2019re through.\u201d I scan him up and down. \u201cEven if you are the sexiest boy alive in that uniform, and if we were at home I\u2019d . . . I\u2019d . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d he says, leaning down closer so his lips are touching mine.</p><p>I wrap my arms around his neck and kiss him.</p><p>When we come up for air, he says, \u201cThe Fitz is back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, tell him that his girlfriend is counting on a winning season.\u201d</p><p>He flashes me one of his irresistible grins and says, \u201cHe already won.\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
