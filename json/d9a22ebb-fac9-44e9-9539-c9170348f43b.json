Gawkers were lined up at a checkpoint near a narrow side-road intersection, even though it was barely sunup. An ambulance sat with its lights off near the storefront. Uniforms milled around, waiting for the coroner to show up.</p><p>\u201cHey, Tommy,\u201d Nick said as one of the uniforms approached him. \u201cHow\u2019re your girls?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame as always, Detective, running the show. How\u2019s your first week back off desk duty?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBlissfully boring. What\u2019ve we got?\u201d Nick asked him.</p><p>\u201cLooks like a smash and grab gone wrong. Old bookstore.</p><p>Shop\u2019s all busted up. Two dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIDs?\u201d Nick asked as he pulled a pair of latex gloves from his coat pocket.</p><p>\u201cOne\u2019s the shop owner. We\u2019re still waiting on the ID for the other. But there\u2019s something else you got to see.\u201d</p> <p>Nick\u2019s partner joined them, brushing against Nick\u2019s shoulder. \u201cSomething besides the dead bodies?\u201d</p><p>The officer nodded. \u201cGood morning, Detective Hagan.</p><p>Yes, we got a witness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHallefuckinlujah,\u201d Nick muttered as he followed.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t thank your lucky stars just yet.\u201d</p><p>Nick repressed a groan as Tommy led them toward some evidence tags in the middle of the road.</p> <p>\u201cThis is where they found him,\u201d Tommy said.</p><p>\u201cIn the road?\u201d Nick asked.</p><p>\u201cOn the ground?\u201d Hagan added.</p><p>\u201cYes, sirs. Thought he was another body at first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is he?\u201d Nick asked.</p><p>\u201cHospital.\u201d</p><p>Hagan smacked Nick on the arm. \u201cThat\u2019s why they gave us this one. So you could go question him and not fuck up a crime scene.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Nick grunted.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re the people person who donated half his liver to his dad,\u201d Hagan said. \u201cYou take the easy part, I\u2019ll go get coffee.\u201d</p><p>Nick grunted as his stocky partner trundled off toward one of the trucks. Hagan and his love affair with coffee were a bane of Nick\u2019s existence.</p><p>Nick glanced around the scene again. The front windows of the store had been busted out, probably shattered by the gunfire. Two bodies were sprawled on the sidewalk in front.</p><p>Shelves of books inside had been toppled, the interior a mess of old tomes. Dust motes floated in the floodlights. Standing behind the barricades was a mass of onlookers.</p><p>Nick sighed heavily and scanned the crowd. He didn\u2019t see anyone who looked like they might be trying to offer information, just a bunch of people with nothing better to do than gawk as the sun rose. Then his eyes landed on someone who looked familiar. Tal , broad shoulders, dark hair. He was wearing sunglasses, and his turned-up coat col ar hid some of his face.</p><p>But Nick thought he recognized him. He started toward the barriers. \u201cGarrett?\u201d</p><p>The man ducked his head and disappeared into the crowd.</p><p>Nick trailed to a stop. Zane Garrett would not have ignored Nick\u2019s greeting. Nick had obviously been mistaken.</p><p>When Hagan returned with two steaming cups of coffee, they climbed back into their unmarked, and Nick dumped his coffee into the street before closing the door and heading off for the hospital to check on their witness.</p><p>Hagan\u2019s coffee, and apparently his patience along with it, were reaching the dregs when they finally found the room their witness had been moved to after his MRI and CT scans and whatever else they\u2019d put the poor guy through. An officer was on the door, and a nurse was in the room checking the man\u2019s vitals.</p><p>He was sitting on the edge of his bed, a blanket around his shoulders. He had his head down. His hair was light and wavy, and he had a day\u2019s worth of stubble. There was a bandage on his neck that seemed to stretch up into his hairline. He was wearing jeans and a blue cardigan, and his shoulder was covered in blood. He certainly wasn\u2019t dressed for midnight acrobatics like a robbery, and though his current state spoke of more than just one bad night in a row, he didn\u2019t ping Nick as an addict.</p><p>Nick slid his suit jacket aside to show his badge before approaching the witness. \u201cMorning, sir,\u201d he said.</p><p>The man looked up. He was haggard, with circles under his eyes. But he was handsome regardless, with eyes that were an unnervingly clear blue. And he seemed confused and scared. Nick couldn\u2019t really blame him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Detective O\u2019Flaherty. This is Detective Hagan. Were you hurt this morning, sir?\u201d</p><p>The man stared at Nick for a few seconds, his eyes glazing over. He blinked and focused his attention back on Nick.</p><p>When he spoke, his accent wasn\u2019t local. It was so far from local that Nick couldn\u2019t begin to place it, other than he sounded a little Southern and a little British. It might have even been fake. \u201cThey said I was shot in the head.\u201d</p><p>Nick could think of nothing to say to that. He glanced at the nurse for confirmation.</p><p>\u201cHe took a glancing blow. It knocked him unconscious, but didn\u2019t penetrate the skul . And I told you to stay in bed,\u201d she said, forcing the witness to recline and covering him with a sheet.</p><p>Nick gaped at her. \u201cJesus.\u201d</p><p>The witness cleared his throat and fiddled with the sheet, obviously uncomfortable.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name, sir?\u201d Nick asked him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d He looked back at Nick, his expression sincerely distressed.</p><p>Nick sniffed and scratched at his chin, not sure whether to be annoyed or concerned. Either the man was exceptionally good at stonewal ing, or he had a serious case of traumatic amnesia. \u201cAll right. Can you tell me what happened this morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t remember. I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know I got shot in the head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t remember anything?\u201d</p><p>The witness winced. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t remember your name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Detective. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Nick nodded and carefully patted the man on the shoulder. He turned to his partner, who stood near the doorway. Hagan had both eyebrows raised, his jaw working back and forth. Nick excused himself, and he and Hagan moved into the hal way, leaning their heads close to talk.</p><p>The officer on the door offered what little he knew. \u201cHe\u2019s got no ID on him. Nothing; looks like whoever shot him thought he was dead and picked him clean.\u201d</p><p>Hagan huffed. \u201cSo not only do we got a witness who\u2019s got no idea what happened, he\u2019s got no idea who he is?\u201d He barely restrained an incredulous laugh. \u201cThat\u2019s not a witness, it\u2019s another motherfucking crime.\u201d</p><p>Nick glanced over his shoulder through the door, to the man on the hospital bed. \u201cNo ID, no memory, shot in the head in the middle of a gunfight outside a robbery of a used bookstore. What. The. Fuck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis ain\u2019t a robbery,\u201d Hagan said with a grunt. \u201cYou don\u2019t shoot three people for an old book, I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s the Gutenberg Bible.\u201d</p><p>Nick nodded. \u201cYou realize this guy could be the doer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think he\u2019s faking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s either a very lucky witness who lived through this, a perp who legit can\u2019t remember, or he\u2019s faking.\u201d Nick shrugged.</p><p>\u201cYou were spec ops. You were trained to lie and shit. Can you tell if he\u2019s lying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but if he\u2019s faking, he\u2019s damn good at it, \u2019cause I\u2019m leaning toward believing him.\u201d</p><p>They both turned to the witness again. He was once again sitting in bed with his head hanging and his eyes closed. His hands were trembling as they clenched at the blanket in his lap. The nurse had left him.</p><p>\u201cWhat do we do?\u201d Hagan asked.</p><p>Nick was at a loss. Did they treat the man as a witness or a suspect? \u201cEither way, if he\u2019s a perp or he\u2019s a witness, he\u2019ll need someone on him,\u201d he finally said.</p><p>Hagan patted Nick\u2019s shoulder. \u201cGreat. You go break the news to him, I\u2019m going to get some coffee.\u201d</p><p>Nick glared after his partner as the man lumbered off toward the nurses\u2019 station. He took a deep breath to steady himself. It wasn\u2019t his first case back since his surgery, but it was his first case back from behind a desk. He hadn\u2019t been dealing with people lately so much as paperwork.</p><p>The witness looked up when Nick approached, and tried to straighten his shoulders, but they slumped again, probably under the weight of his injury and exhaustion.</p><p>Nick\u2019s heart went out to him, and he had to fight to keep his attitude professional. \u201cI\u2019m going to have this officer stay with you in the hospital until they release you. Keep an eye on you. Then he\u2019s going to bring you the station to talk with us a little more. That sound okay?\u201d</p><p>The man nodded, then winced and brought his hand up to his bandage. \u201cYou think I\u2019m in danger?\u201d</p><p>Nick chewed on his lip for a second. \u201cIt\u2019s a real possibility, I won\u2019t lie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s also a possibility I shot those people, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Nick stared at him, shocked again by the man\u2019s strange mix of perception and vulnerability. \u201cThat is also a possibility, yes.\u201dThe witness rubbed a trembling hand over his face. Nick placed a hand on his shoulder in an attempt to offer comfort.</p><p>The man reached up and gripped his fingers hard. He didn\u2019t raise his head or say anything. He just seemed to need the contact.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be okay,\u201d Nick whispered. \u201cWe\u2019ll figure this out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, we got the shopkeeper\u2019s daughter coming in to try to ID the body,\u201d Hagan told Nick, returning from the station break room with two cups of coffee. They\u2019d been partners for almost three years and Hagan still couldn\u2019t remember that Nick didn\u2019t drink coffee.</p><p>Hagan set the cup down in front of him, steaming and giving off a sickeningly strong smell.</p><p>\u201cThrow that away,\u201d Nick ordered.</p><p>\u201cWhatever. You\u2019re welcome.\u201d Hagan sat and chucked his feet up on the desk opposite Nick\u2019s. They were set up facing each other. Nick glared at the coffee cup, then his partner.</p><p>Hagan gave him a toothy smile. \u201cWhat else we got working?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrints are going through the system for the other victim, and the amnesiac witness.\u201d Nick held up a photograph from the crime scene. \u201cAside from the fact that the perps apparently riffled the bookshelves and made a damn mess of everything, the only things that seem to be missing were in this display cabinet.\u201d He set it down and slid it across to Hagan. \u201cDon\u2019t get your coffee near that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Mother.\u201d Hagan picked it up, sipping his coffee as he studied the photo of the display case. The glass doors were intact, the wood unscathed. Whatever had been inside hadn\u2019t been under lock and key. \u201cI mean, what else does a bookstore display besides books?\u201d</p><p>Nick shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ve seen some where they have antiques on show. They\u2019re usually just for atmosphere, though, nothing worth a motherfucking heist.\u201d</p><p>Hagan raised an eyebrow from behind the rim of his coffee cup.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Heist. Everything we have here is looking like a pro job. The security was disabled, there\u2019s no sign of forced entry, and since the shopkeeper bled out where he fell on the sidewalk, it\u2019s probable he wasn\u2019t supposed to be there and the robbers literally ran into him on their way out and panicked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a lot to infer from what little we have.\u201d</p><p>Nick shrugged. He\u2019d always had a knack for seeing crime scenes lay out. He never denied that he could be wrong, but he usually wasn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cOne more odd job for this one, one of the dead guys had a bag under him. They found it when they moved the body. It had four books in it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom the shop?\u201d Hagan asked.</p><p>\u201cWe can only assume until the daughter gets here to ID them. They\u2019re all old, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust old? Or old as balls?\u201d</p><p>Nick barked a laugh before he could stop himself. \u201cThe latter, I assume. Three early nineteenth century, one dating to the Revolutionary War. We can probably assume they were in that display case along with whatever objects were taken because everything else was just trashed, not stolen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re a bookshop owner and you have this display case set up with rare books,\u201d Hagan mused.</p><p>\u201cUh huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe objects you\u2019d put in there for atmosphere would be related to the books, right? Somehow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn my world they would be,\u201d Nick agreed. He pondered it briefly, then nodded and called over one of the uniformed officers working nearby. \u201cDo me a favor, bud, put out some feelers to city pawnshops and dealers, stay on the lookout for artifacts dating from 1750 to 1820. They might be stolen.\u201d</p><p>The officer nodded and headed off.</p><p>Hagan scowled at the photo again. \u201cWas the case wiped clean? Why would they wipe it down if they were wearing gloves?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t. Get this. Best the Crime Lab can tell, they wiped the motherfucking dust off the case to ruin the outline of whatever objects were there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCovering their tracks, or . . .?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess. At least slowing us down. Shouldn\u2019t be hard to find out what was in there, though,\u201d Nick said, still staring at the photos of the crime scene. He absently reached for the cup on his desk, taking a sip before remembering it was coffee.</p><p>He turned his head and spit it out into the trash can, coughing and gagging as Hagan laughed at him.</p><p>\u201cMotherfucker,\u201d Nick grumbled. He tossed the coffee cup into the trash and glared at his partner again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDetective O\u2019Flaherty!\u201d Captain Branson called from his office door. Nick turned in his chair and glanced over his shoulder. The captain waved him over.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up, sir?\u201d he asked when he got closer.</p><p>\u201cThe witness from the bookshop?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, sir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s here. You need to get in on this one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure thing.\u201d</p><p>Branson handed him a file. It was labeled John Doe.</p><p>Nick shook his head; all it contained was the report from the hospital. He made his way to one of the interview rooms and greeted the officer on the door with a pat on the shoulder.</p> <p>When he entered the room, the blond man met his eyes.</p><p>\u201cHello, Detective.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow you doing?\u201d Nick asked as he sat opposite him.</p><p>\u201cI would say I\u2019ve been better, but . . . I don\u2019t really know if that\u2019s true,\u201d the man said with a wry laugh.</p><p>Nick snorted. \u201cStill got your sense of humor at least.</p><p>That\u2019s something.\u201d He opened the file again. It was paltry at best. Useless. \u201cThey been cal ing you John Doe?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s . . . it\u2019s a name, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I can see that getting old fast. Listen, all the John Does I ever knew were already dead, so how about I call you JD? That work for you?\u201d</p><p>He nodded and gave Nick a tired smile. \u201cYeah. Yeah, that works.\u201d</p><p>Nick was silent for a moment, studying the man. He looked even more worn than he had at the crime scene yesterday. Under that, Nick could see the fear. \u201cHas anyone offered you coffee? Something to eat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had a bagel. Don\u2019t have much appetite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Nick put both elbows on the table. \u201cYou remember anything new? Anything at al ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Detective, I\u2019m sorry. The doctors said I have amnesia caused by the trauma. Physical or mental, they couldn\u2019t say. They also couldn\u2019t say when or if my memory would return. They said amnesia was a very case-by-case type of thing, so . . . it might all come rushing back, or it might come back in pieces. Or it might not at all. Ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. That\u2019s rough.\u201d</p> <p>JD laughed bitterly. He twisted his fingers and nodded.</p><p>Nick was having a hard time reading him, something he was usually pretty good at. JD\u2019s exhaustion was masking everything else. Nick gave it a minute or so of silence, waiting to see if the man would begin to fidget or talk. But JD merely sat there, watching his hands, occasionally glancing up to meet Nick\u2019s eyes.</p><p>Nick finally gave up on that tactic. He tapped the file in front of him. \u201cEven though you don\u2019t remember anything, we\u2019re going to treat you as a witness and put you under protection. Bal istics are telling us there were at least two shooters. One was standing behind you, clipped you in the head.\u201d Nick tapped his own head in the area where JD was bandaged. \u201cKilled at least one of those two victims.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe other bullet hasn\u2019t been recovered yet. We\u2019ll know more soon. But until we get to the bottom of this, you need to be safe. Whoever did this won\u2019t know you can\u2019t ID them when they find out you aren\u2019t dead.\u201d</p><p>JD nodded. He glanced up at Nick, his blue eyes piercing.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to dance around it, Detective.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know I\u2019m a suspect. It\u2019s okay. You don\u2019t have to mince words.\u201d</p><p>Nick met his eyes for several seconds, letting JD see what suspects usually saw: a hardened, intelligent cop who would put them behind bars if they made even the tiniest of slips.</p><p>\u201cAll right then. You are a suspect. Our only suspect, right now.\u201dDespite his show of bravado, JD blanched. Nick couldn\u2019t help but feel sorry for the guy. Not knowing who he was or what kind of man he was, it had to be terrifying. Add to that the fact that he was facing a potential murder charge? He had to be reeling.</p><p>Nick took his notepad and a pen from his pocket and placed it on the table, then slid it toward JD. \u201cI\u2019m going to go arrange for somewhere for you to stay tonight. While I\u2019m gone, try to write down anything about yourself you can think of.\u201d</p><p>JD frowned. \u201cLike what? I already told you I don\u2019t remember anything.\u201d</p><p>Nick shrugged. \u201cAnything. Anything you\u2019ve noticed.</p><p>Your feelings, your thoughts, tattoos or scars, your shoe size, do you have contacts, are you wearing underwear? Anything.\u201d</p><p>JD laughed and reached for Nick\u2019s notepad. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Nick smiled and left him there, hoping the exercise would at least keep JD\u2019s mind off his troubles while Nick tried to find somewhere to stick him for the night.</p><p>It took him nearly half an hour to arrange for a hotel and an officer for the door. He and Hagan played a quick three out of five roshambo to decide who had to stay with him, and Nick won. Which was good, because he had plans this weekend.</p><p>When he returned to the interview room, Captain Branson was standing at the window, watching JD.</p><p>\u201cSir,\u201d Nick said as he approached.</p><p>The captain turned. \u201cYou\u2019re good with him, O\u2019Flaherty.</p><p>That\u2019s the most he\u2019s responded all night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s just scared, sir. Anyone would be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay on him. Babysit him. Play the good cop. He\u2019s the biggest break we have in this case right now. If he\u2019s comfortable, he\u2019s more likely to remember. And if he\u2019s faking, you\u2019re more likely to figure it out.\u201d</p><p>Nick cleared his throat and nodded. \u201cDoes that mean you want me to stick with him at the safe house?\u201d he asked, unable to conceal the dread in his voice.</p><p>Branson smirked at him and raised an eyebrow. \u201cIsn\u2019t your boyfriend coming to town tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven I\u2019m not that cruel. Take the weekend. Let Hagan bad cop him for a few days. After that, it\u2019s O\u2019Flaherty to the rescue, understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, sir.\u201d</p><p>Branson slapped him on the back. Nick watched him walk away, breathing out a sigh of relief, then glanced at the officer on the door.</p><p>\u201cDo you even know how to play good cop, Detective?\u201d</p><p>the man drawled.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, no one\u2019s ever let me do it.\u201d Nick put his shoulder against the door and pushed into the room. JD\u2019s head shot up. He\u2019d been dozing. Nick smiled gently for him.</p><p>\u201cDoing okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess so.\u201d He pushed the notepad across the table. \u201cI wrote down everything I could think of.\u201d</p><p>Nick took the notepad and flipped it over. JD had written bullet points in a neat block print. Nick snorted. It was the type of handwriting that was hard as hell to analyze. The kind that people who worked black ops often had a habit of using.</p><p>Nick wrote in the same neat block print. \u201cYou always write like that?\u201d he asked JD.</p><p>\u201cI guess. Why?\u201d</p><p>Nick shrugged one shoulder and stuck the notepad back in his pocket. \u201cMuscle memory. It can be interesting. I\u2019ll look over this in a bit. Right now I\u2019m going to take you to get something to eat, then to a hotel so you can get some rest.\u201d</p><p>JD stood hesitantly. \u201cYou\u2019re taking me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, my partner has some things to tie up before he can meet us there. Is that a problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. No, I just assumed it\u2019d be someone . . . lower on the rung.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to take you out there and get you settled, but Detective Hagan and a uniform are going to stay with you tonight,\u201d Nick answered as he led JD out of the room.</p><p>\u201cIs this going to be your case, Detective? I mean . . . you\u2019re the one who\u2019ll be working it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, me and my partner.\u201d Nick stopped and turned to face JD. They were almost the same height, but JD was thinner and more compact. He took a tiny step back when Nick faced him, like he was intimidated. Nick tried to give him a reassuring smile, but he knew himself well enough to know that when he smiled, it rarely reassured anyone. \u201cI\u2019ll figure this out, man. I promise.\u201d</p><p>JD sat with his hands on the table, folded over each other.</p><p>He played with his fingers as he took in his surroundings.</p><p>Nick got the feeling that he was used to having something on or in his hands to mess with. A ring, maybe. There was no mark, though, no cal uses to give evidence of anything being worn there recently.</p><p>JD\u2019s eyes strayed to the memorabilia along the brick walls of the pub as he continued to fidget. Nick tried not to watch him too closely. He knew the scrutiny would make him nervous, and JD already had enough nervous energy to power a small appliance.</p><p>Nick supposed he couldn\u2019t blame the guy, though. He looked away, trying to find something else to focus on for a while.</p><p>His eyes followed a waitress as she walked by, and his gaze landed right back on JD once she was gone. He had stopped moving, and his narrowed eyes were raking over the wall next to him. The lines around his mouth had relaxed.</p><p>Nick straightened. JD had the look of a man who might have recognized something. Nick glanced up at the reproduction plaque on the wal . He had sat under it many times, gazing at it idly as he waited for his food, reading the words when his dinner mate went to the bathroom, staring at it listlessly as he ordered for that last drink that would send him into taxi territory.</p><p>It was a common fake wood plaque, roughly two feet tall and one wide, featuring a frieze of a nameless baseball player in pinstripes\u2014something many people had defaced over the years because those pinstripes looked far too much like Yankee pinstripes and this was Boston, baby. It was also covered in Red Sox stickers and graffiti.</p><p>Nick looked up at it dubiously, then back at JD. \u201cAre you remembering something?\u201d</p><p>JD was still scowling. He shook his head minutely, still examining the plaque. \u201cI just . . . looking at that gives me a feeling I think is familiar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you seen it before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I think . . . I think maybe I hate the Yankees,\u201d JD answered with a shrug.</p><p>Nick snorted and couldn\u2019t help but smile as he took a drink.</p><p>\u201cI guess that\u2019s nothing spectacular, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell. It\u2019s not going to help narrow you down from the crowd any.\u201d</p><p>The amusement faded from JD\u2019s eyes and he returned his attention to his hands, twisting his fingers together and shifting uneasily in the chair. Nick watched him in sympathy. He couldn\u2019t begin to imagine what was going through his mind.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>JD was already shaking his head. He turned his head toward the bar as he leaned back in his seat. \u201cI remember that Greg Maddux is the greatest pitcher ever to play the game and that Stan Musial had 3,630 hits in his career. I remember that Darth Vader is a bad guy and that vampires are suddenly good guys who sparkle. I remember that I like spinach and artichoke dip, but not when it comes with tortillas. I know that tequila will make me sick and just the thought of a worm at the bottom of a bottle will make me want to hurl. I know that the tattoo on your forearm means you were a Recon Marine and that makes you a Grade A badass, even if you kind of try to hide it. Probably because you like to go under the radar so you can have the advantage in a fight. But I don\u2019t know my own name. I don\u2019t know where I come from, how old I am.\u201d</p><p>He lowered his head. His eyes were misting over, whether from frustration, sorrow, or merely exhaustion was anyone\u2019s guess. Nick was shocked by how observant the man was even in the midst of this ordeal, though, and the realization made him uneasy. Only one person had ever called him out for trying to appear less dangerous than he was, and Ty Grady was the most observant man Nick knew.</p><p>Then there was the tattoo. Nick had a lot of tattoos, including the Celtic cross that traced his spine from the nape of his neck to the small of his back; and the eagle, globe, and anchor that dominated his left shoulder. He also had one on each forearm, and while he usually hid them with dress shirts and suits, he\u2019d rolled his sleeves up when he\u2019d sat down at the pub.</p><p>On the right was an ornate Celtic knotwork gauntlet that covered his entire forearm from just below his wrist to an inch or so from his elbow. On the inside of his other forearm was the Force Recon Jack, one that usually got lost amidst the flashier work he had. It was a skull with breathing gear, with a spade and knife crossed behind it, and wings fluttering out from either side. The skull had thirteen bullet holes in it.</p><p>The knotwork gauntlet was far more impressive, but JD had zeroed in on the Jack in particular\u2014the one with special meaning. Nick hadn\u2019t met many people who actually knew what a Recon Jack even was, so the fact that JD did meant he might be associated with the military somehow. Closely associated.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t even tell you if I\u2019m a good person or not,\u201d JD said.</p><p>His eyes betrayed the frustration and stark fear he\u2019d been hiding so well up to this point. \u201cI mean, what was I doing there in the middle of the night, stone-cold sober at a bookstore? I could be some sort of criminal and not even know it! I could be a cold-blooded killer, and you\u2019re sitting here eating floppy chips with me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen to me,\u201d Nick said harshly. He leaned forward on the table, seeing the turmoil of his own past reflected in JD\u2019s eyes. \u201cWe will find out who you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t promise that, Detective.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell I can\u2019t. And I\u2019ll tell you one more thing. I\u2019ve dealt with a lot of bad people before. None of them are ever torn up wondering if they\u2019re a good person.\u201d</p><p>JD swallowed, but the words seemed to mol ify him. He calmed, his shoulders losing their tension. He sighed and gave Nick a weak smile. \u201cWhen you put it that way . . .\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDamn straight,\u201d Nick said.</p><p>JD smiled softly. \u201cYou\u2019re awfully optimistic for a cop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI mean, I thought all you police-type guys were these brooding, stoic, \u2018drink yourself blind to drown out the ugliness of the world\u2019 types.\u201d</p><p>Nick barked a laugh. \u201cYou\u2019re thinking of Vice.\u201d</p><p>JD just shook his head. \u201cThis happy exterior is hiding some deep, dark secret in your past, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Nick shook his head in amusement as he reached for his drink.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an alcoholic. You\u2019re closeted. You obliterated an innocent town while you were in the Marines. You\u2019re a macho cop who likes to shoot a pearl-handle .22.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI drink in moderation unless I\u2019m pregaming, I\u2019ve quite openly liked dick for the past couple of years, I obliterated a lot of things in the Marines, and the pearl-handle is a .38 Special with a pink tint to it,\u201d Nick answered with a sly grin before taking a sip of his water.</p><p>JD laughed, his eyes sparkling. \u201cYou\u2019re not mysterious at al . You should try amnesia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll leave that to you,\u201d Nick offered with a mockingly humble shrug.</p><p>JD rolled his eyes. Nick took the opportunity to study him for a moment. He seemed better than he had, but that wasn\u2019t saying a lot. He still had dark rings under his eyes, and prominent worry lines around his mouth and on his forehead. He probably wasn\u2019t as old as he looked right now, maybe younger than Nick. He\u2019d spent a lot of time in the sun, judging by the difference in his blond hair versus the scruff of darker beard growing in. He had no visible scars or tattoos, nothing to identify him with. And his strange blue eyes were truly haunting.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d JD said on a sigh. \u201cA hotel with an armed police guard?\u201d</p><p>Nick stared at him thoughtfully. \u201cUntil we get all this straightened out, yeah.\u201d</p> <p>JD smiled weakly. \u201cSounds lovely. I don\u2019t guess I can count on you being there at al , huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot until the first of the week, but hopefully we\u2019ll have this all figured out by then. You\u2019ll be safe. And I\u2019ll find out who you are. I promise.\u201d</p><p>JD nodded, chewing on his lip. \u201cYou always keep your promises, Detective?\u201d</p><p>Nick was silent for several tense seconds before smiling.</p><p>\u201cYes, I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I believe you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Nick grabbed his coat and slid from the booth, gesturing for JD to stand with him. \u201cAnd right now I have to get you to your room, because I promised someone else I\u2019d pick them up at the airport tonight.\u201d</p><p>Kelly Abbott\u2019s flight from Colorado had taken nearly four hours longer than it should have, including a lengthy layover in Charlotte where he\u2019d played with every gadget in the Brookstone store and then made good use of the bar. He was tired, a little wobbly, and had a cramp in his neck because he\u2019d fallen asleep with his head against the window instead of drooling on the guy next to him on the plane.</p> <p>When he hit the escalators that would take him down to the baggage claim at Logan, he bent to scan the crowd below for Nick. It was June in Massachusetts, so it wasn\u2019t like people were all bundled up, but it was busy as hell, so it was hard to tell if Nick was down there.</p><p>Before Kelly had left his house for the Denver airport this morning, Nick had warned him that he might have to send a car to pick him up if his new case warranted it. Kelly didn\u2019t mind; in fact, he was the reason Nick had gone back to work at all.</p><p>Nick had been ready to quit. He\u2019d been a cop for almost as many years as he\u2019d been a Marine, but when the Corps had called him back for a last tour of duty, something inside Nick had snapped. He\u2019d come home and declared he was done with carrying a gun. Kelly had given it a few weeks to let the boredom set in before convincing Nick he was acting rashly.</p><p>Nick never acted rashly; that was Kelly\u2019s job. Besides, he\u2019d been bored as hell without his badge, so he\u2019d gone back to the department for a test run. The first few months had gone off without a hitch.</p><p>Kelly was halfway down the escalator when he caught sight of Nick, and his heart skipped a beat. Nick was dressed in a suit and tie, with a tan trench coat that made him look like a private eye from the \u201950s. He was wearing his badge on his belt, and Kelly\u2019s trained eyes could see the telltale outline of a gun at his hip. He had his phone out, frowning at the screen.</p><p>Kelly\u2019s feet hit the end of the escalator as he stared, and he nearly fell all over himself.</p><p>He stumbled out into the baggage claim area, and Nick obviously saw the motion out of the side of his eye because he looked up quickly, flinching like he might be going for his gun. A smile graced his handsome face when he saw Kelly, though, and he moved toward him, meeting him halfway and wrapping him up in a hug.</p><p>\u201cHave a nice trip?\u201d he asked, laughing softly.</p><p>\u201cShut up. Jesus, you look good.\u201d</p><p>Nick kissed his cheek, then his lips. He didn\u2019t linger over it, though. \u201cI barely got here, didn\u2019t have time to change. You look rough, babe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel rough. Let\u2019s get the hell out of here.\u201d</p><p>Nick grabbed his hand to halt him as Kelly marched toward the door. \u201cDon\u2019t you have a suitcase?\u201d</p><p>Kelly glanced at the crowd around the baggage conveyors.</p><p>His shoulders slumped. All he wanted to do was get Nick somewhere private. Now. \u201cOh yeah.\u201d</p><p>Nick pulled him closer, sliding his hands under Kelly\u2019s jacket to rest on the small of his back. He kissed him gently, with the crowds bustling around them. Kelly realized this might be their first official PDA, and neither of them cared.</p><p>Nick rested his temple against Kelly\u2019s and smiled against his neck. \u201cI missed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d Kelly wrapped his arm around Nick\u2019s neck and dropped his carry-on bag to the floor to get another kiss, but Nick raised his head instead.</p><p>\u201cIs that your bag? With all the patches on it?\u201d</p><p>Kelly grunted and turned to the conveyor. His rucksack had patches from almost every destination he\u2019d traveled, so it was hard to miss. \u201cYeah. Fucking cockblock.\u201d</p><p>Nick burst out laughing. It was a sound Kelly had sorely missed. It sent a shiver through him, making the scar of the bullet wound on his chest throb. He rubbed at it as Nick kissed him again before letting him go and then striding over to catch his rucksack for him. The coat made him look even wider at the shoulders than he already was. Kelly flashed back to all the many mornings he\u2019d seen Nick stalking across whatever camp, base, or ship they\u2019d been stationed on, barking orders.</p><p>He wondered sometimes how he\u2019d gone five years in Recon without molesting his friend. He\u2019d either been absolutely blind to the attraction or he was rewriting the memories in his head, because damn.</p><p>Nick returned, Kelly\u2019s bag thrown over his shoulder and a smile on his face. \u201cReady to go home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not even going to feed me first?\u201d Kelly teased.</p><p>\u201cJust going to take me to your boat and fuck me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s SOP, yeah. Come on.\u201d He led Kelly out into the brisk evening.</p><p>His Range Rover was parked in a no loading zone right beside the taxi lane, and airport security was standing beside it, writing out a ticket. Nick handed Kelly his bag and gestured for him to load it in the car. Kelly watched him as he slid his overcoat and suit jacket aside and tapped the badge on his belt with one long finger.</p><p>The rent-a-cop gave him a wave and moved away, and Kelly climbed into the passenger side. Nick got into the car a moment later, grinning crookedly.</p><p>\u201cYou just abused your authority,\u201d Kelly told him.</p><p>Nick nodded and started the car.</p><p>\u201cYou enjoyed it, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Nick side-eyed him. \u201cSo did you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo much.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>he choppy water lapped at the hull of Nick\u2019s yacht, Tthe sound rhythmic and deep, like Kelly could feel it in his chest as he lay awake in the main cabin. Nick was curled beside him, his breathing uneven, his body tense.</p><p>He was dreaming, and his restlessness made it impossible for Kelly to sleep. Nick tossed his head and murmured something, and as he moved, his fingers grazed Kelly\u2019s arm.</p><p>Kelly flinched, wincing in anticipation of Nick waking. The last time Nick had rolled into him during a dream, he\u2019d startled awake and pinned Kelly to the mattress, his hand around Kelly\u2019s throat, before Kelly could say anything to calm him.</p><p>Not that Kelly minded, because not only could he defend himself with ease, but also the way Nick apologized was pretty fantastically sweaty and naked.</p><p>That had been weeks ago, of course, in Kelly\u2019s cabin in Colorado where Nick wasn\u2019t quite as familiar with his surroundings. Nick usually slept easy, especially on his boat, and the more time that passed since his last deployment, the fewer issues he had. But on stormy nights, when the seas tossed the boat beneath them, when thunder crashed above them and the sounds of the sea infiltrated the hul , Nick was restless and quick to strike out when his nightmares were interrupted.</p><p>Nick murmured something in his sleep again, and Kelly finally gave up on trying to get to sleep himself and pushed the blanket off. He slipped out of bed carefully, not wanting to wake Nick as he headed for the salon upstairs.</p><p>Photos were scattered on the walls there, and the occasional knickknack sat around, but other than that the d\u00e9cor of the yacht was pretty sparse. It wasn\u2019t Spartan or empty, though.</p><p>Kelly had spent plenty of time aboard the yacht since Nick had purchased it. He\u2019d thought nothing on board was foreign to him, but when Nick had shown him the drawer full of sex toys beneath his bed, Kelly had been both shocked and incredibly turned on. He kind of wondered what else Nick had managed to hide away in spaces Kelly didn\u2019t know were there.</p><p>The clouds hid the moon in the sky, and only the skyline of Boston provided light. Kelly closed the shades against it and threw the yacht into almost pitch darkness. He didn\u2019t like the press of a big city so close to him.</p><p>He flopped onto the couch in the salon, letting his eyes adjust to the darkness and glancing around at the nooks and crannies where Nick stored all his personal belongings.</p><p>Hardback books were piled everywhere, most of them on history, archaeology, or lost treasures and mysteries. That had always been Nick\u2019s thing, though. Nick was one of the only jarheads Kelly had ever met who didn\u2019t have a single gun magazine subscription or hang knives on his walls. Kelly wasn\u2019t even sure where Nick kept his medals, because he sure as hell didn\u2019t have them sitting out or displayed.</p><p>The coffee table was covered with files Nick had brought home from work. He\u2019d intended to take vacation days, but Kelly had convinced him not to. He\u2019d used enough of his vacation last year for emergencies; Kelly didn\u2019t want him wasting more to stay home. He wanted him to take real vacations this year. Preferably somewhere warm. Preferably with him.</p><p>Over dinner Nick had mentioned a few details of the case he was working on, a robbery gone wrong that had ended up in murder. Then he\u2019d apologized for bringing work home when Kelly was there to spend time with him, and he\u2019d shoved the files away in favor of resting his head in Kelly\u2019s lap as they watched a movie on Netflix.</p><p>Kelly smiled softly with the memory. Nick had swiftly drifted off to sleep, and Kelly had ignored the movie in favor of twisting his fingers through Nick\u2019s curly hair.</p><p>The memory made the silent boat feel that much lonelier.</p><p>Kelly fought past the tumbling feeling in his gut. He had two more weeks here. He wasn\u2019t going to start getting melancholy about leaving yet, Jesus.</p><p>He stretched to flip on a lamp beside the couch so he wasn\u2019t sitting in the dark like a creeper, and then absently flipped through the pages of Nick\u2019s files on the table. Was it illegal for him to be seeing this information? He shrugged and scanned Nick\u2019s handwritten notes. He loved the way Nick wrote; block print, no discernible quirks, only the slightest hint of a lefty slant. But the faster he wrote, or the more agitated he grew, the more beautiful the scrawl became. He lost the blocking and it took on a personality all its own, a hybrid of print and cursive with precise curves and flourishes.</p><p>It was so telling of Nick\u2019s personality, the hidden part of him only a few people got to see.</p><p>He must have written the notes in shorthand or some sort of code, though, because it read like nonsense. Kelly placed the notepad back where he\u2019d found it and sighed deeply, then hunted for the remote. He might sleep if the television was going.</p><p>He found the remote resting on top of a book beside the lamp: Mysteries of the Golden and Rosy Cross.</p><p>Kelly frowned at the title. Nick liked adventure books, especially the ones that added a little historical mystery to the story. Maybe Kelly could read himself to sleep and he wouldn\u2019t risk waking Nick with the sound of the TV.</p><p>When he opened the book, though, a sheet of paper fell out. Kelly scrambled for it before it could flutter to the floor or disappear into the couch cushions. It was the same kind of paper as in the Moleskine notepad Nick carried around.</p><p>It had obviously been torn away, and on it were two grids, like tic-tac-toe boards, and two Xs, all with symbols in each empty space. A pigpen cipher: a simple substitution cipher that usually used dots instead of symbols. Kelly had taught the kids at the camp he worked at in Colorado how to do these, trying to get them interested in linguistics.</p><p>Kelly had his thumb in the pages the note had been stuck between, and on them he found the same sort of cipher, this time with the correct series of dots, and notes explaining how it was used. Not that Nick needed to look up a pigpen cipher; he was the one who\u2019d taught Kelly how to do them.</p><p>Kelly flipped through the rest of the book. It wasn\u2019t a novel after al , but a book about secret societies, specifically one called the Rosicrucians. Kelly had never heard of them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat are you up to, Nicko?\u201d</p><p>After a few more minutes of contemplating the cipher, which he couldn\u2019t figure out because the symbols were foreign to him, it occurred to him that this might have to do with a case Nick was working on. He slipped the paper into the book and set it back where he\u2019d found it.</p><p>A yawn caught him off guard, and he clicked the lamp off and made his way carefully below to the main cabin. Nick was still and silent, his nightmares no longer plaguing him. It was a relief to slide under the covers beside him and have him curl almost immediately around Kelly.</p> <p>Nick\u2019s hand was warm on Kelly\u2019s bare stomach, his fingers curling against Kelly\u2019s abs. Kelly carefully placed his hand over Nick\u2019s, Nick\u2019s eyelashes fluttered and his nose curled in his sleep. Kelly closed his eyes and rolled in Nick\u2019s embrace until he had cuddled closer and Nick\u2019s arms enveloped him.</p><p>Nick woke with a gasp.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me, babe,\u201d Kelly whispered against Nick\u2019s chest. \u201cIt\u2019s Doc, you\u2019re safe.\u201d</p><p>Nick tightened his grip and pulled Kelly closer. \u201cHey,\u201d he said, his deep voice even gruffer with sleep. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>Kelly pushed his head back so he could see Nick\u2019s face.</p> <p>Nick was still half-asleep, his eyes washed of their usual green in the darkness. His brow was furrowed. It wasn\u2019t unusual for him to be concerned when he woke with Kelly in his arms like this; he could be cuddling, or he could be choking Kelly unconscious.</p><p>Kelly kissed his chin, then scooted up so he could reach Nick\u2019s lips. Nick hummed into the kiss.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cCouldn\u2019t sleep.\u201d</p><p>Kelly rolled onto his back, pul ing Nick with him. Nick curled around him in a way that still surprised Kelly, resting his head on Kelly\u2019s chest and throwing a leg over Kelly\u2019s hips.</p><p>Nick was about as alpha top as a man could get, but when it came to cuddling, he had no compunctions about being held.</p><p>Kelly wrapped his arm around Nick\u2019s shoulder and squeezed him tight.</p> <p>\u201cBoat still throws you off, huh?\u201d Nick mumbled against Kelly\u2019s chest.</p><p>Kelly nodded as he ran his fingers through Nick\u2019s hair.</p><p>When they\u2019d been discharged from the armed services, Kelly had gone home to Colorado and stayed there in a cabin he\u2019d built with his own two hands and a very dedicated earthmover.</p><p>He\u2019d grown accustomed to the smells of pine and snow and earth, the sounds of the wind whispering through branches and animals skittering through the underbrush coming from his open windows.</p><p>The waves lapping at the hull near his head were a sound from the past he hadn\u2019t thought he\u2019d sleep to again. The hustle and bustle of Boston in the distance was completely foreign to him. All the times he\u2019d visited Nick before, he\u2019d always been too drunk by nightfall to care.</p><p>He stuffed his nose into Nick\u2019s curls and inhaled deeply.</p><p>Nick smelled of the sea, salty and cool. He always had, even in the middle of the desert with the hot sun pounding down on their backs or climbing the freezing shale mountains of Afghanistan. Or maybe the sea had always smelled of Nick.</p><p>Kelly had a hard time deciphering which came first in his mind.</p> <p>\u201cWe can get a hotel, if you want,\u201d Nick offered. He was waking up, his voice becoming clear and strong even as he rested his head against Kelly\u2019s chest. \u201cYou\u2019re here for another two weeks, no point in you not sleeping the whole time.\u201d</p><p>Kelly\u2019s lips twitched on a sigh. \u201cI\u2019d rather be here.\u201d</p><p>Nick rested his chin against Kelly\u2019s chest, rol ing over to his stomach and gazing up at him. Kelly stroked his hair, then let his fingers travel down his back, tracing hard muscles under bare skin. Nick shivered when Kelly\u2019s fingers trailed over one of the long scars on his back.</p><p>\u201cI need to get used to it anyway, right?\u201d Kelly asked, but the question caused a flurry of butterflies in his stomach. He and Nick hadn\u2019t talked much about their future. In fact, they\u2019d only gotten as far as telling each other they were in it for the long haul, but they still didn\u2019t have details worked out. Where would they go, what would they do? Would they compromise and move somewhere new, would one of them quit his job, or would they share time between both homes like they\u2019d been doing? They hadn\u2019t even begun to think of any of that stuff.</p><p>Nick had asked Kelly to marry him not long ago, but he\u2019d been fresh out of surgery to donate a piece of his liver to his dying father, and so drugged that Kelly wondered if Nick remembered anything that had happened that day. He\u2019d been told after Nick\u2019s surgery that the surgeons had been forced to give Nick ketamine, which explained why Nick had hal ucinated for a solid week after he\u2019d gotten out of the hospital. He\u2019d spent most of it rambling about killing an old colleague of theirs named Liam Bell and telling Kelly he was beautiful.</p><p>He\u2019d never brought up being engaged, never even panicked about it. That was what really gave it away, actually. Nick was notoriously twitchy about commitment. He\u2019d probably disappear into a puff of smoke that spelled out \u201cnope\u201d in the air if Kelly told him he\u2019d proposed while drugged.</p><p>Kelly hadn\u2019t brought it up again. Just knowing Nick was thinking permanently while high on Dilaudid and ketamine was sufficient to make him giddy, and he was willing to wait until Nick was comfortable enough to bring it up again.</p><p>While sober. But hell, they were still living in two different states, thousands of miles apart. They had bigger issues than forgotten proposals.</p><p>Nick interrupted Kelly\u2019s musings by pushing himself up, leaning his elbow on the mattress at Kelly\u2019s side and placing his hand over the bullet scar on Kelly\u2019s chest. \u201cWe both know you\u2019d go nuts living on a boat all the time, Kels.\u201d</p><p>Kelly swallowed hard, nerves swamping him. Nick really was going to talk about this, about them living together. \u201cAnd you\u2019d go stir-crazy in a cabin in the woods where you couldn\u2019t see the ocean or meet new people every day,\u201d he said with false cheer. \u201cI\u2019m Navy, baby, I was born for boats.\u201d</p><p>Nick\u2019s smile was genuine, but melancholy at best. \u201cLiar.</p><p>You need trees and grass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo get me a bonsai tree and I\u2019ll grow my weed on the flybridge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrong kind of grass,\u201d Nick said as he pulled himself closer and gave Kelly a slow, teasing kiss. He slid his fingers over Kelly\u2019s cheek before clutching at his hair and resting his weight on Kelly.</p><p>Desire tore through Kelly like a wildfire. It always did when Nick touched him. This was his first relationship with another man, but the excitement and adventure had yet to wear off. He was certain that with Nick, it would never fade.</p><p>\u201cI guess we need to talk about it, huh?\u201d Nick murmured between kisses.</p><p>\u201cUnless you want to keep going like we have,\u201d Kelly said.</p><p>\u201cA week here, two there. A month apart. It sucks, babe.\u201d</p><p>Nick nodded fervently and dove in for another kiss.</p><p>\u201cBut I know you and I know me,\u201d Kelly managed to say through Nick\u2019s kisses. \u201cWe\u2019ll work it out. I\u2019m good with it for now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m not.\u201d Nick said before a long, tense silence. He flopped onto his back with a huff. \u201cSo let\u2019s figure it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow?\u201d Kelly practically squeaked. \u201cIt\u2019s the middle of the night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re both up.\u201d</p><p>Kelly gestured to himself emphatically. \u201cUp is the appropriate word, yes.\u201d</p><p>Nick laughed, the sound warming the cool cabin as it drowned out the waves beating at the hul .</p><p>Kelly huffed and rolled to straddle Nick, placing both hands on Nick\u2019s chest and settling onto Nick\u2019s groin, grinning over the fact that Nick was half-hard. Nick shifted beneath him, gripping his thighs. Kelly leaned far to his left to switch on the lamp beside the bed. They both winced away from its dim light, but Kelly was finally able to meet Nick\u2019s incredible green eyes. Nick was gazing at him, indulgent and . . . smitten.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d Kelly blurted, unsure of why he felt inclined to say it just then.</p><p>\u201cYeah, you do,\u201d Nick drawled, grinning wider. His expression softened quickly. \u201cI love you too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck first or talk first?\u201d Kelly asked.</p><p>Nick pursed his lips, scowling in thought. \u201cWhat if we go at it first, then fall asleep and forget to talk? Then it\u2019s still a problem in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cValid. But what if we wind up fighting about it? We\u2019ll miss out on the fucking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s always makeup sex.\u201d</p><p>Kelly pointed at him. \u201cOoh, and angry sex.\u201d</p><p>Nick\u2019s eyebrows rose higher, and he was obviously fighting a smile. \u201cWe\u2019ve never had either. Might be fun.\u201d</p><p>Kelly couldn\u2019t keep from laughing any longer. He ran his hands over Nick\u2019s chest. \u201cShould I pick a fight?\u201d</p><p>Nick\u2019s hands rose higher, settling on Kelly\u2019s waist. \u201cNot just yet,\u201d he murmured, giving Kelly a tug.</p><p>Nick sat up to meet him as Kelly leaned over him, and he wrapped his arms around Kelly as they kissed. He crossed his legs, getting more comfortable as Kelly settled into his lap.</p><p>\u201cThought you voted talk before fuck,\u201d Kelly grumbled.</p><p>Nick kissed him again, nodding. His hands dragged down Kelly\u2019s back. \u201cI did. We\u2019re talking.\u201d</p><p>Kelly laughed. He put both hands on Nick\u2019s shoulders and shimmied his hips, rubbing Nick\u2019s hardening cock against his.</p><p>\u201cNo, we\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, then shut up,\u201d Nick growled. The next kiss was a consuming one, clearly meant to silence Kelly\u2019s habit of rambling when Nick was trying to seduce him.</p><p>Nick\u2019s grip tightened, and before Kelly knew what was happening, Nick had wrapped him up and rolled them, pinning Kelly to the mattress with his head at the foot of the bed and his legs wrapped around Nick\u2019s waist.</p><p>\u201cOkay, that was fun,\u201d Kelly gasped.</p><p>Nick shushed him, then kissed him and rolled his hips.</p><p>They\u2019d already taken care of these needs once tonight; almost as soon as their feet had hit the deck of the yacht, Nick\u2019d had Kelly pressed against the hul , kissing him silly. But it had been almost a month since they\u2019d seen each other, and Nick was finally fully healed from his surgery. Kelly had expected nothing less. In fact, he\u2019d be a little pissed if Nick didn\u2019t maul him a few times a day in the first week of his visit.</p><p>Nick\u2019s cell phone began to ring as they kissed. The sound was muffled, like it was coming from inside something. Nick pushed up with an aggrieved curse. \u201cI\u2019m not answering that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you technically on duty?\u201d Kelly asked.</p><p>Nick muttered something unintelligible and rolled toward the head of the bed. He fumbled under his pillow and came out with the phone.</p><p>\u201cYou keep your phone under your pillow?\u201d Kelly asked with a laugh. This was the first time they\u2019d shared a bed while Nick was on duty. \u201cHow does it fit beside your gun and your knife and the lube?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShhh. This is O\u2019Flaherty,\u201d Nick practically growled when he answered. His eyes narrowed and he started toward Kelly as if he intended to continue what they\u2019d started, but then his expression changed from predatory to alarm, his face softening, his eyebrows rising, his motion halting. \u201cWhen? What happened? Were they attacked?\u201d</p><p>Kelly sat up, scowling. He hoped this was work and not another distress call from one of their friends. The men of their former Recon team, Sidewinder, seemed to have a knack for getting into trouble. And no matter which one of them needed help or what kind of help they needed, Nick was always the first one any of them called.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right there,\u201d Nick spat, then ended the call and tossed the phone aside. He clambered out of the bed and to the closet, talking over his shoulder as he pulled a shirt on. \u201cI have to go. Come with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Kelly scrambled to put more clothes on, but he took his cues from Nick, who didn\u2019t even take the time to put real pants on. He just stayed in his sweatpants and slid his bare feet into a pair of plastic flip-flops as he headed for the steps. Kelly was still struggling to get a shirt on as he followed.</p><p>Nick broke a record number of traffic laws on the way to wherever they were going, but the smal , portable flashing light on his dash seemed to make it okay. Was that legit? He\u2019d been in a car with Nick a thousand times, though, and he wasn\u2019t even compelled to hold on to the handle when they weaved through traffic or took a sharp turn. Nick was possibly the best driver Kelly had ever known. Sometimes it seemed ill-advised, but Kelly trusted him implicitly. In the driver\u2019s seat, that was. The one time Nick had flown a helicopter was a different story. Their buddy Owen still refused to get into a helicopter after that trip.</p><p>When they arrived at a nondescript hotel, there wasn\u2019t any hustle or bustle like Kelly had expected. No uniformed cops on the streets, no flashing lights, no panicking guests in the almost empty lobby. Nothing but a single man in uniform as they stepped off the elevator. Nick held up the badge on a chain around his neck as he walked by.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s with me, he\u2019s okay,\u201d he said in passing, pointing at Kelly. Kelly nodded to the man, trying not to feel awkward. He had been special operations in the military and was extremely capable both in the field and in any situation stateside. He had medical training that could save a life under enemy fire, and he could break a man\u2019s neck before they knew he was there.</p><p>But he wasn\u2019t a cop. He didn\u2019t know the first thing about investigating or the law. The only reason he was here was because he was trailing after his boyfriend. He didn\u2019t like the feeling.</p><p>Nick headed for room 319, where another officer stood guard, a plastic chair near him against the wal . Nick showed his badge again, even though each man they\u2019d passed obviously knew him by sight. When they entered the hotel room, a stocky man with silvering hair stood near the bathroom door, shaking his head at Nick. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat the hell happened?\u201d Nick demanded.</p><p>\u201cHe freaked. I don\u2019t know. He won\u2019t talk to me. I figured you have the rapport with him, he might respond.\u201d</p><p>Nick nodded, frowning at the bathroom door, then glancing over his shoulder at Kelly. \u201cUh, Kels, this is Detective Alan Hagan, my partner. He\u2019s useless when I\u2019m supposed to have the night off.\u201d</p> <p>Kelly shook the man\u2019s hand, introducing himself. He didn\u2019t offer his relationship to Nick, though. That was Nick\u2019s job, and frankly, Kelly didn\u2019t know how sensitive the subject was for him. He knew Nick had come out as bi to basically everyone in his life not long after he\u2019d come out to Kelly. How everyone had handled it, Nick had never said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the boyfriend?\u201d Hagan asked as he shook Kelly\u2019s hand. \u201cO talks about you all the damn time.\u201d</p><p>Kelly flushed, clearing his throat and smiling uncontrol ably. He glanced at Nick again. He wasn\u2019t sure why he kept being surprised by how open Nick was about their relationship. He knew Nick hated secrets, hated having them especially. He should have known Nick wouldn\u2019t hide him.</p><p>Hide them.</p><p>Nick had his ear against the bathroom door. He knocked gently. \u201cHey, bud, it\u2019s Detective O\u2019Flaherty,\u201d he called, keeping his voice low and soothing. \u201cYou okay in there?\u201d</p> <p>The response was muffled, but from the way Hagan raised an eyebrow and cocked his head, it was more response than he\u2019d been receiving.</p><p>\u201cCome closer to the door, we can\u2019t hear you,\u201d Nick called.</p><p>He waited, holding his breath. There was a thump against the door and he moved away a little like he hoped the man was opening it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d the voice said from the other side. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I freaked out. I just . . .\u201d</p><p>Nick leaned his shoulder into the doorjamb. \u201cHey, it\u2019s okay. You got every right to be freaking out, we all know that.</p><p>If you feel safer in there, you go ahead and stay, okay? That\u2019s all we want is for you to feel safe right now.\u201d</p> <p>Nick paused, and his eyes met Kelly\u2019s. He smiled gently and winked. Kelly bit his lip to keep from smiling at such an inappropriate time. He\u2019d seen Nick talk dozens of frightened young Marines down from panicking. He could be soothing, if he chose to be.</p><p>\u201cI would like to know what scared you, though,\u201d Nick continued. \u201cDo you feel like telling me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have kids, Detective?\u201d the man in the bathroom asked.</p><p>Nick frowned in confusion. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured you might have toddlers or something. You\u2019re talking to me like one right now.\u201d</p><p>Nick\u2019s eyes narrowed, and he gave the door an insulted frown. \u201cFine! So how about you get your ass out of the bathroom and we\u2019ll talk like adults.\u201d</p><p>Hagan inhaled sharply, and the guard on the door tensed.</p><p>The man in the bathroom was silent. Kelly winced when it seemed like Nick\u2019s tactic had backfired, but then they heard soft laughter through the door.</p> <p>The lock clicked and the door edged open. Kelly had sort of expected a neurotic-looking little bald guy in glasses or something, but the man who peered out was maybe six feet tal , just an inch or two shorter than Nick. He was wiry and fit, with a healthy tan and shaggy blond hair that had obviously been bleached by time in the sun. His eyes were a blue that seemed Photoshopped. Fuck, he was kind of Nick\u2019s type.</p><p>Nick was still leaning against the doorjamb, one eyebrow raised at the man. \u201cTouch\u00e9, Detective,\u201d the blond man said.</p><p>Nick nodded, crossing his arms smugly.</p><p>The guy glanced at Hagan. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I get it. Don\u2019t hurt my feelings any. People always like him better.\u201d</p><p>The guy\u2019s eyes landed on Kelly, and Kelly tried to offer him a comforting smile even though he still had no clue what was going on.</p><p>\u201cJD, this is my partner, Kelly Abbott,\u201d Nick said as he waved his hand in Kelly\u2019s direction. \u201cKels, this is our witness who doesn\u2019t know who he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d Kelly whispered.</p><p>\u201cI thought . . . I thought Detective Hagan was your partner,\u201d JD said, frowning and looking between them.</p><p>\u201cPartner,\u201d Nick said gently, pointing at Hagan. Then he transferred the finger to Kelly. \u201cBoyfriend. You want to sit down and tell me what happened?\u201d</p><p>JD cleared his throat and nodded, glancing again at Kelly and Hagan as a flush rose to his cheeks.</p><p>\u201cGuys, give us a minute, huh?\u201d Nick said as JD headed for the beds in the hotel room. Nick stopped and took Kelly\u2019s arm, giving him a quick kiss on the cheek. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, this\u2019ll be a couple minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d Kelly\u2019s heart was still fluttering from the fact that Nick had so readily claimed him in front of anyone and everyone, from the possessive glint in Nick\u2019s eyes. He would have sat out in the hall waiting all night just to see that glint in Nick\u2019s eyes again.</p><p>He headed out of the room with Hagan, glancing back to see JD sitting on the end of one of the beds and Nick settling onto the dresser opposite him so they could talk. He looked very professional about it, if you discounted the sweatpants that were drenched at the bottom and the plastic flip-flops he was wearing.</p><p>The door fell closed and Kelly was left with the two cops in the hallway. He stuffed his hands into his pockets and bounced up onto his toes. \u201cSo!\u201d he said cheerfully.</p><p>\u201cThis is fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis guy\u2019s a fucking basket case,\u201d Hagan grunted. \u201cMight be here awhile. Want some coffee?\u201d</p><p>Kelly shook his head and leaned his back against the wal .</p><p>He slid down to sit, propping his arms against his knees. If there was one thing spec ops knew how to do, it was sleep sitting up.</p><p>Nick kept crossing his arms and then forcing himself to stop, resting his hands in his lap instead. He didn\u2019t want to give off body language that said he was irritated, impatient, or closed off. It was hard, though, when he was going on a few hours\u2019 sleep and had been interrupted during what was supposed to have been an entire weekend alone with Kelly.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had a dream,\u201d JD said with a helpless shrug. \u201cI woke up in a panic, bolted for the bathroom, and sat in the tub until I could breathe.\u201d</p><p>Nick nodded, his expression carefully neutral. \u201cYou remember the dream?\u201d</p><p>JD shook his head, wincing. He was wringing his hands, rocking a little. \u201cI feel stupid. I\u2019m so sorry. I\u2019m sorry they called you down here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d Nick leaned closer, lowering his voice. \u201cPeople aren\u2019t built for this kind of stress, all right? You handle it however you can, no shame in that.\u201d</p><p>JD sniffed and laughed ruefully. \u201cHave you ever woken up in a bathtub, Detective?\u201d</p><p>Nick opened his mouth and then closed it fast, looking over JD\u2019s head as the memory flashed through his mind. \u201cYes.</p><p>But I was hungover and . . . not alone. My point, though, is that waking up and bolting for safety is nothing to be ashamed of. I wake up swinging all the time. I tried to kill my boyfriend with a TV remote one time, so . . . I get where you\u2019re coming from. There\u2019s no shame in fear.\u201d</p><p>JD took in a shaky breath and rubbed a hand over his face.</p><p>\u201cYou still can\u2019t remember anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I dreamed about the bookstore. I was there.\u201d JD shook his head. \u201cBut then we knew that already, huh? All I remember is something about a book, I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Nick had his Moleskine pad out, jotting down notes. He nodded for JD to continue talking as he wrote.</p><p>\u201cI think . . . I felt like I wasn\u2019t in the right place, you know? Like I knew I wasn\u2019t supposed to be there. I couldn\u2019t get away though.\u201d</p><p>Nick made an asterisk and wrote out the possibility that JD had been forced to accompany someone to the robbery.</p><p>He glanced up to find JD rocking faster. It was a habit he was familiar with, and it usually signified it was time to switch topics. \u201cOkay. Tell you what, bud, why don\u2019t you try to get some rest tonight. Monday morning I\u2019m hoping I\u2019ll have some pictures to show you; we\u2019ll see if they jog anything else loose.\u201d</p><p>JD nodded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve also got someone running down your prints, going through missing persons reports. By morning, those results should be back.\u201d</p><p>JD tensed, glancing up to meet Nick\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if they come in and tell you I\u2019m someone horrible?\u201d</p><p>A pang of sympathy hit a little too close to home. It was one thing to struggle with your humanity. It must have been torturous to do so without the benefit of past actions or even past thoughts to back up your conclusions.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine it will,\u201d he offered gently. He leaned forward and patted JD on the knee. \u201cTry to get some rest, okay? I\u2019m going to call Hagan back in and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t stay, can you?\u201d JD blurted. When Nick raised an eyebrow at him, he paled, looking shocked that he\u2019d spoken at al . \u201cI mean . . . he\u2019s nice and al , but you\u2019re the only person I\u2019ve felt comfortable with. I . . .\u201d</p><p>Nick had to fight hard not to groan. He always managed to pick up the strays somehow. He shook his head, feeling guilty for blowing off such a sincere request because he wanted to go home and fuck his boyfriend. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, we can\u2019t just switch things up without reporting it and giving a compelling reason to do it.\u201d</p><p>JD lowered his head, looking crestfallen. He nodded, though, and took a deep breath. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou good for tonight?\u201d</p><p>JD nodded again, more confidently this time. \u201cI\u2019m good.\u201d</p><p>Nick sat with him for a few more minutes, letting him know he was merely a call away, that he\u2019d be right back on the case on Monday, and there was nothing to worry about as long as he stuck with Hagan or one of the officers assigned to their door.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I brought you out so late. Tell your boyfriend I\u2019m sorry too; this must be weird for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe met in Recon,\u201d Nick said. \u201cHe\u2019s used to weird.\u201d</p><p>He stood and gave JD\u2019s shoulder a last pat before heading for the door. When he stepped into the hal , Hagan was leaning against the wal , his head back and his mouth open as he snored. Kelly had fallen asleep sitting ramrod straight against the wall right beside the door.</p><p>Nick snorted and glanced at the uniformed officer, who was sitting in his chair with a cup of coffee and giving Nick a smirk. \u201cAre you guys the cavalry?\u201d</p><p>Hagan jerked and snorted, shaking his head as he woke.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m awake.\u201d</p><p>Nick chuckled and nodded, stepping aside so Hagan could get back into the room. \u201cI told him you\u2019d call me if anything came up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got it, brother. You deal with this shit better than me,\u201d Hagan said, and then stumbled toward his bed and flopped into it.</p><p>Kelly was still sitting with his back against the wal , blinking up blearily at Nick.</p><p>\u201cYou can fall asleep in under five minutes sitting in the hal way of a hotel, but you can\u2019t sleep in my nice soft bed on my boat.\u201d</p><p>Kelly licked his lips and reached up for Nick to help him to his feet. \u201cMaybe we should sleep on the flybridge again,\u201d he said as they headed for the elevators. \u201cI slept like a baby up there on that pool float with Ty that one time.\u201d</p><p>Nick snorted and jabbed at the elevator button. \u201cWe\u2019re getting a hotel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, tell me about this case. The witness has amnesia?\u201d</p><p>Kelly asked in the car on the way back to the Boston Harbor Marina. He\u2019d tried as long as he could to keep out of it, but he was just too curious.</p><p>\u201cYeah, he took a bullet to the back of the head. Doctors said it\u2019s either physical damage or shock of some kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKind of like that time I got kicked in the head by that goat.\u201d</p><p>Nick burst out laughing. \u201cYeah, kind of like that.\u201d</p><p>Kelly glanced at him, admiring his profile. He still owed Nick for that. They\u2019d been on a mission when they\u2019d taken cover in a gully that just happened to be sheltering several goats, including one territorial billy goat who\u2019d taken a shot at Kelly\u2019s head. He\u2019d woken up as they\u2019d been carting him back to camp, and Nick had convinced him he was a Bible salesman from Oklahoma who\u2019d gotten fresh with the livestock and paid for it with a hoof. Kelly\u2019d believed it for two whole hours before his memory came back. He still had trouble looking at goats without flashes of completely unwarranted guilt.</p><p>\u201cAsshole,\u201d Kelly muttered.</p><p>Nick very nearly giggled before he got himself under control. He cleared his throat. \u201cAnyway. We don\u2019t know if he has any solid information or not, we don\u2019t even know who he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould he be one of the robbers? Got knocked out at the scene and just pulled something out of his ass when he woke up rather than going to jail?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a real possibility, yeah. That\u2019s the other reason we\u2019ve got him under protection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Smart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed,\u201d Nick drawled, throwing Kelly a sly smirk before he turned his eyes back to the road.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen you in detective mode. It\u2019s kind of . . . sexy.\u201d</p><p>Nick merely smiled. Kelly watched him, pondering the silence that fell between them. It wasn\u2019t uncomfortable. It never had been, not from the first moment they\u2019d met. It could sometimes be heavy, though, especially during the months after Nick had returned from his POW experience in Afghanistan.</p><p>This silence was something different. It was easy and light, devoid of expectation. Kelly liked it. But he could sense that Nick had more on his mind than the next few weeks with him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHey babe, do you want me to go back home until you get this case wrapped?\u201d Kelly asked. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be in the way.\u201d</p><p>Nick glanced at him, eyes widened in alarm. \u201cNo. No, you\u2019re not in the way. I never said that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you never said it, but I also know how your brain works. You\u2019re not going to stop mul ing over the mystery, but whenever you do think about it and you think you should be spending time with me instead, you\u2019re going to feel guilty for working.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are the shittiest liar in the history of lying liars.\u201d</p><p>Nick laughed softly, reached over the console, and grasped Kelly\u2019s hand. \u201cFine, you\u2019re probably right. But I don\u2019t want you to leave. Please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. So tell me more about the case. Can you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTechnically, no. But hell, I\u2019ve told you national security shit you shouldn\u2019t know either so what the hell.\u201d</p> <p>Kelly gestured to himself, tracing a circle in the air around his face. \u201cIt\u2019s this beautiful mug right here. Like a puppy. Does this look like the face of a spy?\u201d</p><p>Nick glanced sideways at him. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough. But tell me anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe robbery was in an antiquarian bookstore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAntiquarian? That\u2019s specialty stuff, not just used paperbacks, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Rare books, expensive stuff.\u201d Nick had to release Kelly\u2019s hand to flip the turn signal on, which apparently pissed off the car behind them because it honked at them as it passed. Nick ignored it. \u201cShop was busted up like they were looking for something. Security system would have been easy to bypass even for a rudimentary cat burglar, but they took it out without leaving a trace.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo you think it was a professional team?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably.\u201d There were more honks behind Nick and he peered into the rearview mirror. He muttered under his breath. \u201cWhat are these fuckers doing?\u201d</p><p>Kelly glanced behind them. \u201cIsn\u2019t that just how Massholes drive?\u201d</p><p>Nick flicked on the police light on the dash. The honking stopped and the offending car slowed until more space was between them and Nick\u2019s Range Rover.</p><p>Kelly turned back around in his seat. \u201cI\u2019m really enjoying the power trip that comes with fucking a cop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what they all say. Anyway. Pro crew hits rare bookstore. They take four books and two objects out of a display case, all possibly linked to the Revolutionary War.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat objects?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know yet.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause we\u2019re not psychic, dude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the shop owner?\u201d Kelly asked.</p><p>\u201cDead. Killed on the sidewalk in front of the store along with one of the robbers. Reports say there were shots fired, witnesses are saying anywhere from five to a dozen. We haven\u2019t recovered all the bullets or casings yet, but there were at least four. One of which clipped JD.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod. Who would kill for a handful of old books?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo clue.\u201d Nick rolled his window down and slid his security key into the marina\u2019s gate controls.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019re your off-the-wall theories you\u2019re afraid to tell your partner \u2019cause he laughs at you?\u201d</p><p>Nick grinned crookedly as he pulled into the marina parking lot. \u201cYou want my off-the-wall theories?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive it to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want it hard, babe, come on.\u201d Kelly offered him a cheeky leer.</p><p>Nick snorted. He threw the car in park, then turned it off and sat back, his hands on the wheel. \u201cIntergalactic tea-loving time travelers trying to help the British win the Revolutionary War. Pissed-off historians in an attempt to liberate artifacts from their cages. Or treasure hunters out to find the missing Knights Templar library.\u201d</p><p>Kelly laughed and leaned his head against the cool glass of the window, pointing a mocking finger at Nick. \u201cWhere do you get this shit?\u201d</p><p>Nick smacked him in the chest. Kelly grabbed his hand and refused to let it go. \u201cCan I play devil\u2019s advocate for your theories?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Nick grunted. He unbuckled Kelly and reached for him with the other hand, dragging him across the console.</p><p>Kelly began to protest, but Nick kissed him almost brutally, his fingers tightening in Kelly\u2019s hair, his other hand bunched in Kelly\u2019s shirt.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Kelly panted. Nick had a habit of being turned on at the oddest times by the most random things. Kelly never knew when Nick was going to grope him.</p><p>It made things interesting.</p><p>\u201cWe started something, I was thinking we\u2019d finish it,\u201d Nick growled, still tugging Kelly across the console.</p><p>The tone of his voice hit Kelly deep in the gut. \u201cNot in the boat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be able to walk to the boat, babe.\u201d Kelly climbed the rest of the way over the console and into Nick\u2019s lap. His elbow hit the horn as they kissed, and the Range Rover sat there screaming about how its occupants were making out until Nick reclined the seat. He shoved it all the way back, taking Kelly with him, and Kelly straddled him, laughing again.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re fucking insane,\u201d he gasped. He stroked his hand across Nick\u2019s cheek to lighten the blow of the words. \u201cWhat the hell turned you on this time?\u201d</p><p>Nick reached for his neck, gripping it hard and pul ing him down into another demanding kiss. He kept his hand on the back of Kelly\u2019s head, refusing to let him sit up, refusing to let him break the press of their bodies. \u201cJust you. Moonlight on your smile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRomantic, but are you sure this isn\u2019t just a history nerdgasm you\u2019re having right now?\u201d Nick smiled against his lips. \u201cRevolutionary War, you\u2019ve probably been hard since you heard those words.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo help me out with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did earlier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen fucking do it again.\u201d</p><p>Kelly shifted in his lap until his hardening cock rubbed against Nick\u2019s through the sweats they both wore. Nick groaned and spread his legs further until he was able to prop his bare foot up on the dash beside the steering wheel. He raised his hips, shoving his cock against Kelly\u2019s, and they both moaned between their kiss.</p><p>\u201cShrapnel in your thigh, bad knee. How are you this flexible still?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMotivation,\u201d Nick said, and he was just breathless enough that it sent another jolt through Kelly\u2019s body. He loved when Nick got so turned on he didn\u2019t try to wait for a bed. Or privacy. God, he loved it.</p><p>He ducked to kiss Nick again, delving into his mouth, licking at his teeth, and finally sucking on the tip of his tongue as Nick\u2019s hands tightened on him. The kiss went on and on, and Nick\u2019s hand found its way under Kelly\u2019s sweatpants to grab his ass. He dug his fingernails in. Kelly had never experienced this kind of possessiveness before he\u2019d started fucking Nick, but now everything Nick did seemed to claim him.</p><p>There was a loud banging on the window right beside Kelly\u2019s head. They both startled, but when Kelly tried to lift up, to react, Nick held him right where he was, trapped against the steering wheel, not breaking the kiss.</p><p>\u201cHey, you can\u2019t do that out here!\u201d their intruder shouted.</p><p>Nick fumbled between their chests and found his badge, then slammed it against the glass, holding it there as the chain tapped against the window.</p><p>\u201cSorry, Detective,\u201d the disgruntled security guard said.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t recognize you.\u201d</p><p>Nick snickered as he dropped the badge to resume his hold on Kelly\u2019s hair.</p><p>\u201cThat was fucking hot, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo are you,\u201d Nick grunted. He raised his hips, his hard cock sliding along Kelly\u2019s, the head jutting against the inside of Kelly\u2019s thigh. He pulled at Kelly\u2019s ass, ready to recommence as if they\u2019d never been interrupted.</p><p>Kelly groaned and lowered his head, gritting his teeth.</p><p>\u201cNick.\u201d</p><p>Nick merely chased Kelly\u2019s mouth with his own, kissing him fiercely, pul ing his hair as the kiss consumed them both.</p><p>Kelly\u2019s hips started moving again of their own accord. Nick held him as if Kelly might try to get away from him.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get to the boat,\u201d Kelly gritted out. \u201cI want you inside me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo fucking late, don\u2019t stop moving,\u201d Nick gasped against Kelly\u2019s lips. He took in a deep breath as he writhed under Kelly. Kelly grunted his name again when he realized Nick was coming. Nick\u2019s grip hardened. \u201cKels,\u201d he whispered almost reverently. The way he gazed up at Kelly, the love and utter devotion in his eyes, was something Kelly saw every time they touched, every time they made love. He\u2019d never seen Nick look at anyone or anything else that way.</p><p>Kelly nuzzled against his face, then bit his neck as he gave in to his own orgasm, gritting his teeth around Nick\u2019s skin to keep from shouting out for mercy. Nick shouted for him, though.</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d The breathy gasp in Kelly\u2019s ear sent shivers through his body.</p><p>Kelly kissed him as they both came down from the post- orgasm high. \u201cLove you too,\u201d he whispered. \u201cEven if you do like hunting intergalactic librarians.\u201d</p><p>Nick rolled his eyes, valiantly fighting not to smile. He popped the handle on the door, and Kelly went tumbling out of the Range Rover to the ground.</p><p>\u201cIt was intergalactic historians. Damn, son, get it right.\u201d</p><p>The shower in the master berth wasn\u2019t what one would call spacious, but Nick had still convinced Kelly to join him in it. They couldn\u2019t move without touching each other, and that was just fine with Nick.</p><p>They had actually shared a lot of showers before they\u2019d become romantically involved. Sometimes in the places they were sent with Sidewinder, water was scarce and sharing was practical. Sometimes it\u2019d been time that was scarce, and sharing had been practical. Nick had worked hard not to make that practice even remotely sexual, no matter which teammate or random strange Marine he was sharing with. It had always been hardest with Kelly because the man had no sense of personal space and no hint of self-consciousness. But now Nick was completely at liberty to run his hands down Kelly\u2019s sides, to press him against the tile and kiss his neck, to steal the water because he was a few inches taller.</p><p>Okay, that last one he\u2019d always done.</p><p>When they were both clean, they crawled into bed. The sun would be coming up soon. He\u2019d have to go back to work in twenty-four hours. Until then, however, he and Kelly could wrap up together under the covers and close out the world.</p><p>Nick was almost asleep, curled on his side with Kelly wrapped around him from behind. It didn\u2019t matter how they started; Kelly always wound up the big spoon.</p><p>\u201cWhat books were they?\u201d</p><p>Nick startled back to full consciousness, inhaling noisily and blinking the sleep away. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I thought you were still awake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat indicated that? Was it the snoring?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up. What books were they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh . . .\u201d Nick rolled to his back and rubbed his face.</p><p>\u201cOne was a firsthand account of the Battles of Lexington and Concord. Diary. Really rare. Another was something about English royalty. The last one was a book of maps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said there were four. What was the last one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . . have no idea. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if they took the books, they\u2019re obviously important.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t exactly a new concept to Nick, but he\u2019d been concentrating more on the missing objects and assuming they were valuable. Not necessarily that they were important. He pushed up onto his elbows and looked at Kelly through the darkness. \u201cExplain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, going with your treasure hunters theory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKels, I was joking about that. Intergalactic time travelers? Come on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but listen. They went for books, dude. Your average dead guy in the street can\u2019t sell rare books on the black market, and pawnshops don\u2019t deal with shit like that. Where are you going to get money for a rare book?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn antiquarian bookshop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, and you just fucking robbed it. So you\u2019re not trying to make money off your haul. What are books good for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHitting intruders?\u201d Nick mumbled. He rubbed his eyes again. \u201cDoorstops. Insomnia. Special interrogation techniques. Silencing bedmates in the middle of the night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll totally valid. But I\u2019m talking about information.</p><p>Books are good for information.\u201d</p><p>Nick continued to rub the heel of his palm against his eye, ruminating on that. He finally looked up, seeing stars briefly before Kelly\u2019s face swam back into focus. \u201cYou\u2019re saying they weren\u2019t after things to sell, but they\u2019re looking for something in particular.\u201d</p><p>Kelly shrugged. \u201cMakes as much sense as robbing a bookstore, dude. How\u2019d you know which books were stolen, anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe recovered them at the scene.\u201d Nick sat up, staring at the mirror that lined the closet across the cabin. \u201cHuh.\u201d</p><p>Kelly\u2019s hand drifted over Nick\u2019s bare back, tracing the lines of his tattoo and making him shiver. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw someone that morning; I\u2019d forgotten about it. I thought it was Garrett, even called out to him. But . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou thought you saw Zane? Do I need to be worried about this little zombie bromance you two have struck up?\u201d</p><p>Nick huffed, too tired to offer Kelly a real smile. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m fucking Ty\u2019s fianc\u00e9 on the side, Kels. Sorry.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m good with it,\u201d Kelly said with a shrug. His fingers continued to trace the lines of Nick\u2019s back. \u201cSo who was it you saw?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you remember me telling you about Ty and Zane and the CIA chasing them a few years back? Ty called from the road begging for me to pick them up in Philly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you fired at CIA agents and then got arrested to give Ty and them time to get away. That\u2019s why there\u2019s holes in your boat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt still floats. Anyway, the dude they were trying to keep safe, his name was Julian Cross. He was an operator trying to make a break from the Company.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe looked a whole lot like Garrett. Maybe it was him I saw.\u201dKelly laughed softly, his fingers gentle against Nick\u2019s skin.</p><p>\u201cWas he nice? Did he say hi with a super-secret decoder ring?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou always are,\u201d Kelly drawled. He sat up, and the sheets pooled in their laps. \u201cYou think this Cross guy is behind the robbery?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFirst instinct is no. He really did seem like he was trying to break when he was on the run with Ty and Zane. He had his boyfriend with him, scared rabbit type.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow, that\u2019s . . . judgey.\u201d</p><p>Nick laughed weakly. \u201cWell, he was. And Cross was a hitter. He didn\u2019t do jobs like this.\u201d</p><p>Kelly rested his chin on Nick\u2019s shoulder, face so close that Nick couldn\u2019t even turn his head to meet his eyes. Instead, they looked at each other in the mirror. It made Nick smile, and he tried to hide it by pressing his lips together hard.</p><p>\u201cSo, why bring him up?\u201d Kelly asked before kissing Nick\u2019s bare skin.</p><p>Nick shivered and closed his eyes. \u201cHe was there when he should be in hiding. He might know something. Might be involved.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow do you find him?\u201d Kelly kissed him again, moving down Nick\u2019s arm.</p><p>Nick grunted. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ll give Ty a call later, see if he has any advice. Actually . . . I\u2019ll call Garrett; Cross and Ty didn\u2019t get along very well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurprise,\u201d Kelly sang, and he kissed the back of Nick\u2019s shoulder a last time and then flopped to the mattress. \u201cOkay, I\u2019m sorry I woke you. Come here and keep me warm.\u201d</p><p>Nick lay back down, sliding his body against Kelly\u2019s and finally settling with his head on Kelly\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>Kelly\u2019s fingers drifted through his hair, trying to soothe him to sleep. But Nick\u2019s mind was whirring now. He kissed Kelly\u2019s chest, humming.</p><p>\u201cYou want to go in right now and start working on this, don\u2019t you?\u201d Kelly asked, deadpan.</p><p>Nick raised his head. \u201cSort of. Do you mind?\u201d</p><p>Kelly chuckled and shook his head. \u201cMy fault for waking the sleeping dog. Go on.\u201d</p> <p>Nick kissed him quickly and rolled out of bed to get dressed. \u201cCall me when you wake up, I\u2019ll come get you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet me for what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to see if I can get the captain to hire you as a consultant on the case.\u201d He hopped as he pulled his pants up and fastened them.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d</p><p>Nick grinned mischievously and crawled back into bed, his belt still in his hand. He kissed Kelly soundly. \u201cBecause I\u2019m running with your treasure hunter theory and I\u2019ll need you to back me up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Kelly sounded breathless and a little panicked.</p><p>Nick headed for the steps, buttoning his dress shirt as he went. \u201cThat\u2019s not my theory, it\u2019s your theory!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot according to the report I\u2019ll be submitting!\u201d Nick called back.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare put my name to a time-traveling Knights Templar librarian, you crackpot!\u201d</p><p>Nick laughed as he slid his feet into his shoes and headed for the door.</p><p>Chapter 3</p><p>hat are you doing here on a Saturday? How \u201cWthe fuck long have you been here?\u201d Hagan asked Nick as he tossed his coat onto his desk chair.</p><p>Nick looked up from the files he was studying.</p><p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d Hagan said as he saw Nick\u2019s face. \u201cYou look like a feral cat in an alleyway. What have you done to yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFound a case of energy drinks in the break room,\u201d Nick answered, his words clipped and precise. \u201cI think I got something on this case, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it contagious? \u2019Cause I\u2019d rather not do . . . this,\u201d Hagan said as he waved his hand at Nick.</p><p>\u201cNo. Okay so, we have the books they went after in the shop, right? But why take books you can\u2019t hope to sell? Discounting the highly unlikely scenario that they had a buyer for those specific rare books, which could be true I guess\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cO.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean they could just be front men for someone with money, but still, it had to be the books themselves they were after and those books specifically.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDude, can you feel your tongue?\u201d</p><p>Nick picked up the book he\u2019d been examining and turned it so Hagan could see it. \u201cLook. This one has a complete surveyor\u2019s map of Boston from 1819, and a copy of an earlier reproduction from 1779.\u201d</p><p>Hagan raised an eyebrow. \u201cWhat happened in 1819?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. I don\u2019t know. But that\u2019s what all four have in common.\u201d</p><p>\u201c1819?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. They\u2019re all contemporary reports from Boston in the years after the Revolution.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVive la r\u00e9volution. So . . . a crew of highly trained thieves broke into a rare bookstore, stole four books and two as yet unknown objects, and then kil ed a man, all because they\u2019re planning a heist of Revolutionary War era Boston?\u201d</p><p>Nick glanced up at his partner, nodding.</p><p>\u201cWhere are they hitting next to get their time machine parts? We should put a few unis on that shit.\u201d</p><p>Nick glared at him for several seconds, then his eyes darted over Hagan\u2019s hands. \u201cWhere\u2019s my coffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, fuck no.\u201d Hagan threw both cups of coffee in the trash can, shaking his head. \u201cNo more caffeine for you.\u201d</p><p>Nick stared at them, seriously thinking about reaching in after one of them, when Captain Branson paced over to their desks. Nick and Hagan both watched him expectantly. He stood over them with his hands behind his back. Nick was pretty sure he and Hagan hadn\u2019t done anything to draw their captain\u2019s ire, but you never knew.</p><p>Branson pursed his lips and peered into the trash can, then back at Nick. \u201cCorrect me if I\u2019m misreading you, Detective O\u2019Flaherty, but were you about to go after that cup of coffee in the trash bin?\u201d</p><p>Nick\u2019s eyes darted to the trash can, then back to his captain\u2019s again. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>Branson nodded sagely. \u201cHow long have you been here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure, sir.\u201d</p><p>Hagan cleared his throat. \u201cPlease don\u2019t ask him to explain his current theory.\u201d</p><p>Nick pressed his lips tightly together, self-aware enough to know when not to speak. He avoided Branson\u2019s eyes for all of two seconds before he gave in, though. \u201cI have a consultant I\u2019d like to bring in on the case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHunting treasure.\u201d</p><p>Branson frowned, gave Hagan one last sideways glance, then cocked his head at Nick. \u201cOkay. Make sure he signs the waivers.\u201d</p><p>Nick and Hagan watched him walk away, aiming for his office with a steaming mug of coffee in hand.</p><p>\u201cWhat just happened?\u201d Hagan finally asked.</p><p>Nick shook his head, still frowning at his captain. Then he turned back Hagan and straightened up. \u201cWhere\u2019s the witness?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI left him in the break room with a uni.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d he do last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter you left, he was fine. You got the Midas touch, my friend.\u201d Hagan reached to his desk like he was grasping for a cup. He looked confused for a moment before seeming to realize he\u2019d tossed his own coffee in the trash as well. He and Nick both leaned over the edge of the desk to eye their trash can.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t tell if you don\u2019t,\u201d Nick offered.</p><p>Hagan gave a single nod, then stood up and coughed, making a show of fixing his tie and smiling around the squad room as Nick fished the cups out of the trash.</p><p>Kelly had to get directions to Nick\u2019s desk, and it was like trying to find his way through a rabbit warren as he navigated the department. When he finally saw someone he recognized, Nick\u2019s partner Hagan, Kelly could have hugged the man.</p><p>\u201cHey, Doc, how they hanging?\u201d Hagan asked as soon as he saw Kelly.</p><p>\u201cUm . . . they can\u2019t complain with the current situation.\u201d</p><p>Hagan laughed. \u201cSorry, O always calls you Doc. I don\u2019t remember your real name,\u201d he admitted. He gestured toward the desk opposite him. \u201cHave a seat. Want some coffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m good, thanks.\u201d Kelly eased into the chair, Nick\u2019s chair, watching Hagan suspiciously. He actually reminded Kelly a little of Nick; he was so deadpan you could never tell when he was joking.</p><p>Hagan was alternately tapping at his computer and reading a notepad on his desk, probably filling out a report or transferring notes. Kelly glanced around the room. There were more pods of desks like this one, in various degrees of organization. Nick\u2019s desk, in comparison to the others, was very clean. It was almost empty, in fact. There was a large doodling pad in the center with notes and rough sketches all over it. There was the regular desktop fare, such as a stapler and a cup of pens and a computer. Nick had been back at work for several months, but most of that time had been spent doing desk work. Kelly could imagine him sitting here, bored to tears, organizing everything again and again.</p><p>A single photograph adorned the desk, in a simple black frame. Kelly reached for it, letting a finger run across the faces of his brothers-in-arms. It was a photo of the six men of Sidewinder, all of them ten years younger, all of them grinning at the camera, dressed in their combat gear.</p><p>They\u2019d taken a picture before every mission, just in case no one came back. This had been their last mission before being decommissioned.</p><p>Nick stood in the middle of the back row, a smile on his grease-painted face. Ty had his arm around Nick\u2019s neck, and Nick was resting his elbow on Kelly\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>The other three members of the team, Owen Johns, Elias Sanchez, and the Cajun they\u2019d called Digger, were kneeling in front of them.</p><p>Kelly glanced at the desktop again. No pictures of family.</p><p>None of Nick\u2019s sisters, whom Kelly knew he loved dearly.</p><p>None of any of his coworkers here in Boston, past or present.</p><p>Just Sidewinder.</p><p>Kelly\u2019s chest twisted and tightened, and he rubbed at the scar near his heart as it throbbed. He replaced the frame careful y.</p><p>When he looked up, Hagan was watching him. \u201cYou boys must have been some kind of special.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were.\u201d</p><p>A hand clapped his shoulder, and he jerked in the seat. It was difficult sometimes for Kelly to resist the urge to defend himself when something surprised him, even a decade after seeing his last combat. Of course, almost being killed on vacation in New Orleans a year or so ago, and then again on vacation in Scotland several months back, had reinforced the instinct a little.</p><p>Nick leaned over and kissed him on the cheek. Kelly turned his head and caught a real kiss from him before he straightened. He was shocked by the public display, but then, he kept having to remind himself that Nick had been out for a few years now.</p><p>\u201cYou got here okay?\u201d Nick asked him. He sat on the edge of the desk, grinning down at Kelly.</p><p>\u201cYeah, no problem. Why do you look like you just ate a canary?\u201d</p><p>Nick reached across his desk and opened a manila file folder. He tapped the paper and handed Kelly a pen.</p><p>\u201cCongratulations, you\u2019re our newest special consultant.\u201d</p><p>Kelly grunted. \u201cAre you serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to promise the city you won\u2019t sue if you die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could I sue if I died?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA paralegal,\u201d Hagan said without looking up from his computer.</p><p>Nick barked a laugh. Kelly rolled his eyes and yanked the pen from his hand, signing the consent form before either of them could make another joke.</p><p>\u201cWhat am I supposed to be specializing in?\u201d Kelly asked.</p><p>\u201cTreasure hunting,\u201d Nick answered, still grinning widely.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re insane. Seriously. Did you get checked out when they let you out of the Corps this time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Nick put a hand on Kelly\u2019s head as he slid off his desk. \u201cCome with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you . . . high?\u201d Kelly muttered as he followed.</p><p>\u201cThere may have been a little too much caffeine consumption this morning, but it\u2019s evened out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure about that, bud?\u201d</p><p>Nick laughed and ushered Kelly into what appeared to be a break room. The man from last night, JD, was sitting on one of the sofas. He stood when they entered, shuffling nervously.</p><p>Kelly went over to shake his hand. \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good, thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill no memory, though,\u201d Nick added. He had his hand on the small of Kelly\u2019s back, his fingers sliding beneath the belt. Kelly was almost positive he didn\u2019t realize he was doing it. \u201cWe\u2019re going to work on maybe trying to jog something loose. I was hoping you\u2019d sit in with us.\u201d</p><p>Kelly took a seat beside Nick. He knew what Nick wanted him to do without Nick having to ask him: he was using Kelly as a lie detector test without letting JD in on the fact that they were testing him.</p><p>Nick flopped a folder on the break room table and gestured for JD to sit with them. \u201cOkay, I\u2019m going to show you some pictures\u2014just hold them up and then set them down. You don\u2019t say anything, just let them sink in, okay?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>JD nodded, glancing between them uneasily.</p><p>Nick opened the folder and took the top photo. He held it for a few seconds, then laid it on the side of the pile. He went through several more, and Kelly focused on JD\u2019s eyes.</p><p>Whenever he thought he saw a glimmer of recognition or a reaction of any sort, he would tap Nick\u2019s thigh beneath the table and Nick would lay that photo sideways.</p> <p>When they got through the whole pile, Nick separated them, taking only the photos he\u2019d set down sideways. \u201cOkay,\u201d he said to JD, still smiling warmly. \u201cThis time if you get anything, let us know. Okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Nick held up the first few photos. Kelly couldn\u2019t see what they were, but as he watched JD\u2019s face, he could see the man struggling to remember. He\u2019d figured out what they were doing. He knew the photos in this second round were somehow more important than the first. Kelly\u2019s heart went out to him. He looked so lost and frustrated.</p><p>On the fifth photo, JD held his hand out. \u201cStop,\u201d he said urgently.</p><p>Nick froze, holding the photo up as JD stared at it.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen that,\u201d JD whispered. He plucked the photo from Nick\u2019s fingers and scowled at it. \u201cThis feels familiar to me. I know I\u2019ve seen this before. What is this?\u201d</p><p>Nick glanced at Kelly, and suddenly he looked grim. He rested both elbows on the table and frowned at JD. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the items that was stolen from the bookstore. We got the IDs an hour ago.\u201d</p><p>JD\u2019s head shot up, his eyes widening.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a brooch worn by a Revolutionary War soldier during the Battle of Bunker Hill. The owner\u2019s daughter said it\u2019d been in their family for over two-hundred years.\u201d</p><p>JD\u2019s mouth worked silently, and he looked from the photo to Nick and back. \u201cSo since I recognize it . . . does this mean I stole it?\u201d</p><p>Kelly glanced at Nick, holding his breath when Nick met his eyes. Nick looked truly regretful. He joked about being the bad cop and how everyone here considered him a hard-ass, but Kelly knew better. Nick had the purest heart of anyone he\u2019d ever known.</p> <p>\u201cAll it means is that you\u2019ve seen this before,\u201d Nick assured JD. \u201cYou could have been a regular customer at the shop. You could have seen this photo somewhere, say . . . an insurance company or a museum. The only thing it proves is that you weren\u2019t there by chance. You are connected to this robbery somehow, that\u2019s all we can say with any certainty.\u201d</p><p>JD took a deep, shaky breath. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Nick tapped his stack of photos, straightening them, then he set them on the table as he stood. \u201cWe\u2019ll be right back. You need anything? Food, drink?\u201d</p><p>JD answered with a dejected shake of his head.</p><p>Nick and Kelly left him sitting there. Kelly noticed a uniform lurking near the door as they exited, and Nick gave him a nod as they passed. Whether JD knew it or not, he was being held prisoner.</p><p>\u201cYou were blowing smoke up his ass, right?\u201d Kelly said under his breath. \u201cHe\u2019s your main suspect, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty much,\u201d Nick admitted. \u201cHe\u2019s looking damn guilty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sucks. To commit a crime and not even remember why you did it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLike Tijuana that one time.\u201d</p><p>Nick and Kelly both shuddered with the shared memory.</p><p>Nick sat at his desk and turned his chair to glance back at the break room.</p><p>\u201cDude,\u201d Hagan said. \u201cI know in your mind he\u2019s a puppy in a cardboard box with a \u2018take me home\u2019 sign around his neck, but you can\u2019t fight the evidence building up here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid the prints come back yet?\u201d Nick asked, sounding frustrated.</p><p>\u201cYeah. John Doe Number Alive didn\u2019t hit anywhere. But John Doe Number Dead came up with a prior.\u201d Hagan turned his computer screen around so Nick and Kelly could see it.</p><p>\u201cDarragh O\u2019Doyle,\u201d Nick read under his breath.</p><p>\u201cThat sounds made up,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cIs that real?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not local,\u201d Hagan told them.</p><p>\u201cIrish national?\u201d Nick asked. Hagan nodded. \u201cKnown associates?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone listed. He got pinched last year but he never turned on his crew. Did six months, got out on good behavior, last record of him was that he\u2019d headed back to Ireland.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell he\u2019s back now. So we have an Irish connection.\u201d</p><p>Nick sat back in his chair, making a clicking sound with his teeth and tongue as he stared at the screen. \u201cLet\u2019s expand the fingerprints to international databases, see if we get a hit.\u201d</p><p>Kelly cleared his throat, waiting until Hagan got up and left before leaning toward Nick. \u201cIsn\u2019t Julian Cross Irish?\u201d</p><p>Nick nodded and pulled his phone from his back pocket.</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk to him.\u201d He hit the speaker button and set his phone on the desk between them.</p><p>\u201cSpecial Agent in Charge Garrett here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, aren\u2019t we fancy,\u201d Kelly teased.</p><p>Nick shook his head. \u201cHey, Garrett, it\u2019s O\u2019Flaherty. And the Doc, obviously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God, what now? Are you in jail? Being held by the IRA? Stuck on a reef in the Caribbean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cThat\u2019s uncalled for.\u201d</p><p>Zane laughed. \u201cI thought being engaged to Ty gave me some extra snark privileges.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Nick shouted. \u201cDo I come running when you need help? Did I get shoved off the edge of a cliff for your ungrateful ass? Does my boat still have bullet holes in it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt still floats,\u201d Zane countered, a smirk obvious in his voice.</p><p>Nick grunted.</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t heard from you two in a while, what\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>Zane said, voice casual. Kelly had grown familiar enough with Zane to know he was taking care with his words, though. \u201cYou need to come to Baltimore, come see us.\u201d</p><p>Kelly gave Nick a sideways glance to see how he\u2019d react to that, but Nick was expressionless. \u201cSorry, babe, this isn\u2019t a social cal . I need to know how to get in touch with Julian Cross.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCross. Why?\u201d</p><p>Nick made another clicking sound, refusing to answer.</p><p>\u201cNever mind, I didn\u2019t ask,\u201d Zane said quickly. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to get in touch with him. I assume he just shows up when he smells blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about Grady? You think he\u2019d know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell no. Ty spits nails when you mention Cross\u2019s name.</p><p>He says Cross stole his kitties.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I figured,\u201d Nick said with a sigh. \u201cThat\u2019s why I called you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it?\u201d Zane asked pointedly.</p><p>Kelly tensed and couldn\u2019t stop himself from glancing toward the framed photo of their team, Ty\u2019s arm around Nick\u2019s shoulders as they smiled. The state of Nick and Ty\u2019s fracturing friendship was a topic only the bravest of men would touch on. Zane had balls of brass to do it.</p><p>Kelly cleared his throat and leaned closer to the phone.</p><p>\u201cWe figured with your Bureau contacts, you\u2019d be the better source. Since Ty is all . . . wild card now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Zane said wryly.</p><p>\u201cYou got a lead on Cross, or no?\u201d Nick asked, his words more clipped than they had been.</p><p>\u201cNo. Want me to put out some feelers? Or get Ty on it? Please God, let me put Ty on it, he needs something to do besides remodeling that damn building.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Fuck no. I don\u2019t want Cross to know I\u2019m coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re looking for him, he already knows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Hey, thanks Garrett. We\u2019ll talk to you later.\u201d</p><p>Nick ended the call and slammed his hand onto the desk.</p><p>\u201cDamn it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat mean Cross is a dead end?\u201d Kelly asked gently.</p><p>\u201cFor now. Next thread.\u201d Nick tapped the evidence photos of the books that had been recovered at the scene. \u201cWe follow your books.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy books? No. No, you\u2019re not pinning those on me for when they go bust.\u201d Nick smirked. Kelly snorted. \u201cYou\u2019re enjoying this too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, babe, it\u2019s a treasure hunt,\u201d Nick teased.</p><p>\u201cYou hope it\u2019s a treasure hunt, or you\u2019re going to look stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the special consultant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the detective who called in the special consultant.\u201d</p><p>Nick glanced over Kelly\u2019s shoulder, then stood and stole a quick kiss. \u201cCome on. Let\u2019s get some lunch before Hagan gets back and I have to buy his food.\u201d</p><p>They didn\u2019t even make it to the stairs before Hagan caught them trying to sneak out. \u201cFuck no, I get to interrogate the boyfriend, damn you,\u201d Hagan called to them. He grabbed his coat off his chair, making it spin around and bang into the desk.</p><p>They stopped to wait for him. Nick was chuckling softly.</p><p>\u201cI like your partner,\u201d Kelly said quietly.</p><p>\u201cYeah, don\u2019t tell him that though.\u201d</p><p>Kelly nodded, but Nick\u2019s eyes were straying to the break room, where the uniformed officer was still standing guard.</p><p>Kelly\u2019s brow furrowed as he thought about JD sitting in there alone, his mind turning over everything he couldn\u2019t remember. He knew Nick was thinking the same thing.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he murmured. \u201cIs it legal and shit to take your witness with us? Maybe new surroundings will get him remembering faster.\u201d</p><p>Nick chewed on his bottom lip, frowning, his eyes lingering on the break room door. He took a deep breath and then sighed before heading over there.</p><p>Hagan was fighting with his coat when he joined Kelly.</p><p>\u201cHe bringing the stray to lunch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you expect anything less from him?\u201d Kelly asked fondly.</p><p>Hagan grunted. \u201cYou should see the last stray he convinced me to keep around. Teeny tiny little puppy he found in a storm drain, half-dead and starving in the middle of the night. All the local shelters were closed up so we had to take it in for the night. Bastard told me he couldn\u2019t have it on his boat \u2019cause it\u2019d fall off and drown. Fucking thing was too weak to walk and he convinced me it\u2019d take a header off the side of a boat!\u201d</p><p>Kelly couldn\u2019t stop his grin.</p><p>Hagan appeared almost sheepish. \u201cI still got that damn mutt. Weighs a hundred pounds. Best friend I ever had.\u201d</p><p>Kelly laughed. \u201cWell he can\u2019t keep this stray either. You have room for an amnesiac with great bone structure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if he pisses on the carpet like the last one,\u201d Hagan grumbled as he headed for the elevators.</p><p>They sat at a booth in a local pub near the precinct house that obviously catered to cops. In fact, after staring around at the pictures on the walls long enough, Kelly found Nick up there. He gazed up at the photo, smirking. Most of the photos were official, full uniform and regalia, with stone-faced men and women staring at the camera like they could cause it to burst into flame. It reminded Kelly of the military photos they\u2019d taken.</p><p>Nick didn\u2019t exactly smile in photos, but he didn\u2019t keep a straight face either. The look he usually gave was more of a challenge, with a half smirk that basically said \u201ccome at me, bro\u201d and a glint that said Nick would enjoy the fight.</p><p>He\u2019d made the same expression in his police portrait that sat high on one of the walls, and Kelly couldn\u2019t take his eyes off that face.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d JD finally said, clearing his throat and glancing around uncomfortably. \u201cIs this like a last meal or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re awful fatalistic for a dude who lived through being shot in the head,\u201d Hagan observed.</p><p>\u201cMaybe if I remembered it, I\u2019d be more likely to look on the bright side,\u201d JD grumbled.</p><p>\u201cInnocent until proven guilty, babe.\u201d Nick\u2019s voice was low and sent a shiver up Kelly\u2019s spine. \u201cLook, we haven\u2019t had any hits, but we have eliminated some things, and frankly, that\u2019s as good as we could hope for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Hagan pointed his fork at Nick. \u201cWe put you through all the systems and got nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat . . . sounds awesome,\u201d JD said, voice flat and sarcastic.</p><p>\u201cWhat that means is you don\u2019t have a record,\u201d Nick offered.</p><p>\u201cMeaning I\u2019m a smart felon and I\u2019ve never been caught.</p><p>You\u2019re right, that is good news.\u201d</p><p>Kelly coughed to cover a laugh.</p><p>Nick pursed his lips, narrowing his eyes. \u201cIt also means you\u2019re not military, and you\u2019ve never worked government or municipal. You\u2019re not part of any education systems, and so on. Rules out everything you would have been printed for.\u201d</p><p>JD nodded and looked down at his hands, turning them over to run a finger across his tips. His nails were still stained from the ink they\u2019d printed him with.</p><p>Nick was watching him too, frowning harder the longer he looked at him. He reached to the cuff of his shirt, unbuttoning and rol ing it up. He showed JD the inside of his arm and tapped the tattoo with his finger. \u201cYou know what this is?\u201d</p><p>JD nodded. \u201cI told you yesterday, I recognized it. It\u2019s the Recon Jack.\u201d</p><p>Nick glanced at Kelly, one eyebrow raised. Kelly couldn\u2019t school his features fast enough to hide the surprise. Nick looked around the pub. It was early for lunch, so there weren\u2019t many people there. He began to unbutton his shirt.</p><p>\u201cDude,\u201d Hagan said through a mouthful of food. \u201cThat\u2019s your other job. Got to stop confusing them. Tired of suspects stuffing your pants with dol ar bills during interrogation.\u201d</p><p>Nick shoved his sleeve aside, then pulled up the sleeve of his undershirt to reveal a well-defined biceps and shoulder. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kelly leaned away from him to get a better view. Nick glanced sideways at him, giving him a dirty look.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m perving on you. What then?\u201d Kelly asked.</p><p>They all laughed at him, and Hagan whistled and pointed his fork at the bite mark Nick had exposed on his neck.</p> <p>\u201cGood Lord,\u201d he said. \u201cDo you even call it sex, or is it more like sparring with you two?\u201d</p><p>Nick rolled his eyes. He tapped the oversized tattoo on his shoulder. It covered his entire shoulder, running from the center of his col arbone to his biceps and covering both the front and back sides of his arm. It was a work of art, pure and simple, following the defined lines of Nick\u2019s muscles. \u201cYou know what this is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEagle, globe, and anchor,\u201d JD answered immediately.</p><p>\u201cMarines.\u201d</p><p>Hagan\u2019s eyebrows had shot higher, but he remained silent.</p> <p>Nick began to button up his shirt again, and he jerked his chin toward Kelly. \u201cShow him yours.\u201d</p><p>Kelly nodded. The one on his arm was partially visible under the sleeve of his T-shirt, so he just pulled the sleeve up and turned so JD could get a good look. It was a simple anchor, but with snakes encircling it and wings at the top to form a caduceus. The word NAVY was written on a scroll at the bottom.</p><p>JD studied it for a moment, then glanced between Nick and Kelly. \u201cWell, it\u2019s a Navy tattoo, that much is obvious. I don\u2019t recognize it, but I know it means you were a corpsman.</p><p>Probably a SARC, since you two served together and he\u2019s a Marine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoddamn, he knows more about this shit than I do,\u201d Hagan said.</p><p>Kelly glanced between them. He wasn\u2019t sure what this meant since he didn\u2019t have the whole picture, but Nick looked troubled. Kelly didn\u2019t blame him. This guy hadn\u2019t printed as military, but he knew what Nick\u2019s Recon Jack was, and that was a pretty specialized symbol. People might recognize it as being military, but they didn\u2019t know what it meant, not really.</p> <p>JD did. People who knew military but weren\u2019t military were usually mercs.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d JD asked, beginning to fidget again. \u201cIs this bad? I see the look on your faces; this is bad.\u201d</p><p>Nick ran his fingers across his lower lip, not responding.</p><p>Kelly watched him, wondering if he\u2019d come to the same conclusion, and if he\u2019d be honest with his suspect when he did.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Nick finally said. \u201cYou\u2019ve obviously been exposed to some military culture at some point because your knowledge is above average.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo . . . what, I\u2019m some sort of gun for hire then? Like Blackwater, or . . .\u201d JD trailed off, staring at the tabletop.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d I know that name? How do I know what that is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, yesterday you were telling me you knew all kinds of things, sparkly vampires and whatever,\u201d Nick said, his voice sliding back into that soothing honey tone he used so often.</p> <p>\u201cBlackwater is a well-known company, it\u2019s not weird you\u2019d know it. Just stay calm about it. This is stuff any military brat would know, okay?\u201d</p><p>Hagan gave JD a pat on the shoulder and an almost reassuring smile. \u201cWe\u2019ll figure this shit out. My boy here is a dog with a bone; we got you.\u201d</p><p>Kelly stayed quiet. He did wonder, however, if Hagan\u2019s words were a warning for JD to heed when his memory did start coming back.</p><p>We got you.</p><p>Chapter 4</p><p>ick led the way out of the pub, holding the door Nfor the others and giving the street a cursory glance out of habit. Movement out of the corner of his eye drew his attention, and standing on the other side of the street was Julian Cross. His hands were in his pockets, his head cocked as he watched them.</p><p>Nick let the door fall away from his hand, and it closed in Kelly\u2019s face. Nick heard the impact and the cussing that accompanied it, but he took a step toward the road anyway.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d he shouted.</p><p>Cross merely shook his head, then turned and melted into the lunchtime crowd. Glass shattered behind Nick, accompanied by the pops of gunfire. Nick lunged for a nearby car, glancing back at the others. They were still inside the restaurant. Kelly had gotten them to cover as soon as he\u2019d sensed that Nick had seen something.</p><p>Nick drew his gun and crouched behind the car, trying to decide where the shots had originated. Was it Cross? No one was that fast, the shots were coming from an entirely different location. If the shooter had been aiming for Nick, they\u2019d have hit him. The shots sprayed the door to the pub instead, ruining the entryway, gouging holes in the brick and mortar.</p><p>\u201cDoc!\u201d Nick shouted above the din. He couldn\u2019t see any of them, and he prayed they\u2019d gotten to cover.</p><p>Just as quickly as it had begun, it was over. An otherworldly silence fell on the normally bustling street.</p><p>Nick waited a few breaths before peering over the top of the car. All he saw were people flattened on the sidewalks, covering their heads. No one was running. No one was trying to conceal a weapon.</p><p>Glass tinkled behind him, and Nick saw Kelly crouching against the doorframe, gaze raking the street.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d he called to Nick.</p><p>Nick nodded. He gestured for Kelly to retreat back into the restaurant, and Kelly immediately backed into the dim interior. Nick peered over the car again. People were cautiously raising their heads, crying, looking around like frightened animals in an earthquake.</p><p>Then one man rose calmly to his feet, brushed off his black overcoat, and began walking down the sidewalk as if nothing had happened.</p><p>Nick stood. \u201cCross!\u201d</p><p>Julian didn\u2019t hesitate or look back. He broke into a sprint.</p><p>Nick lunged to his feet and gave chase.</p><p>Kelly shoved away from the doorway and onto the sidewalk as soon as Nick bolted. He put a hand on his head, cursing under his breath. His eyes scanned the building tops and the people who were slowly getting to their feet. He didn\u2019t see any threats. Whoever had opened fire on them had retreated by now.</p><p>\u201cDid he get eyes on the shooter?\u201d Hagan shouted as he jogged out to join Kelly. He stood on his tiptoes to catch sight of Nick and the man he was chasing.</p><p>They could see both men dodging passersby, veering out into the road as the chase carried them toward the massive intersection that Kelly was pretty sure bordered Boston Commons.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s gaining on him,\u201d JD said. He had joined them without Kelly realizing it.</p><p>Kelly glanced around, then put a hand on JD\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYou need to get back inside, come on.\u201d</p><p>Several cops had been eating at the pub, both on and off duty, and they streamed out to help contain the scene. Hagan stood in the doorway, cal ing in the incident and requesting backup for his partner, who was in pursuit of a suspect.</p><p>Kelly finally gave in and climbed on top of the ruined car Nick had taken cover behind. He stretched to see down the narrow street, trying to find either man. He finally caught sight of Nick, trudging back down the sidewalk, alone.</p><p>\u201cOh, he\u2019s going to be so pissed,\u201d Hagan grumbled as soon as Kelly relayed the information.</p><p>When Nick got closer, he was indeed fuming.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Kelly demanded.</p><p>\u201cI lost him!\u201d Nick snapped.</p><p>\u201cWas it the shooter?\u201d Hagan asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why\u2019d you chase him down?\u201d Hagan asked.</p><p>Nick sighed heavily and shrugged at Kelly. \u201cYou know the holes in my boat?\u201d he asked Hagan.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but it still floats.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. That was the guy. Cross. I\u2019ve seen him twice now, once at the murder scene, and just now. He\u2019s up to something.\u201d</p><p>Hagan flopped his arms dramatically. \u201cWhy is the CIA robbing a bookstore in Boston?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre . . . are you saying I might be CIA?\u201d JD asked incredulously.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Nick and Hagan both said at the same time.</p><p>\u201cI thought Cross got out of the game,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cWhy\u2019s he back in it?\u201d</p><p>Nick shook his head and lowered it a little, like a bull preparing to charge. His jaw tightened and his nostrils flared.</p><p>Kelly tensed, like he might need to talk Nick down from something. He rarely needed to, because Nick\u2019s control of his temper was near legendary. But when he did . . . Kelly had put him on his back a few times to keep him from hurting someone.</p><p>\u201cCross wasn\u2019t the one taking shots at our witness, so let\u2019s worry about him later and get JD somewhere safe,\u201d Nick finally said through gritted teeth.</p><p>\u201cThis place have a back door?\u201d Kelly asked.</p><p>Hagan indicated for them to follow him. Nick shrugged out of his suit coat and put it around JD\u2019s shoulders, and he stole a Red Sox hat from the coat rack as they passed by it and placed it on JD\u2019s head.</p><p>\u201cEyes on the ground,\u201d Nick murmured close to his ear.</p><p>JD pulled the hat lower and hunched his shoulders, shrugging into Nick\u2019s coat as they stepped into the narrow alleyway behind the pub. He and Hagan started off toward the end of the alley, but Nick stopped and pulled Kelly aside.</p><p>\u201cIf the words \u2018I want you to go home until it\u2019s safe\u2019 come out of your mouth, I\u2019m going to break one of your ribs,\u201d Kelly told him before Nick could speak.</p><p>Nick finally tore his eyes away from JD\u2019s retreating form and met Kelly\u2019s with a small smile. \u201cYou know me better than that.\u201d He bent and took his spare gun from a holster at his ankle, then pressed it into Kelly\u2019s hands. \u201cI do want you do go back to the Fiddler, though, and get two spares for us. You know where I keep them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn every nook and cranny you can find.\u201d Kelly automatically checked the gun, even though he knew Nick would have it loaded and ready.</p><p>\u201cGood. Ammo\u2019s in a galley drawer. If you\u2019re going to be shot at, you might as well be able to shoot back.\u201d</p><p>Kelly nodded silently. \u201cWhat\u2019s the plan? With the witness, I mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have to find him a new safe house. Make sure we\u2019re not tailed. They knew he was at the precinct; we have to assume the hotel is blown.\u201d Nick chewed on the inside of his cheek, his eyes focused on something over Kelly\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking about putting him on the Fiddler.\u201d</p><p>Kelly glanced up at him, eyes widening. \u201cYou\u2019re going to hide a witness on your boat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe marina has security. We\u2019d both be there; we\u2019ll pull Hagan too. We can put her out in the harbor each night, make it a job to get to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNick.\u201d</p><p>Nick met his eyes again, and they were hard as jade. The stunning color almost made Kelly stutter.</p><p>He took a deep breath. \u201cLook, I know you\u2019ve got a soft spot for this guy, but you\u2019ve got to remember he might not be what he says he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSoft spot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Kelly said with weak laugh. \u201cIf we weren\u2019t a thing, you\u2019d be all over him.\u201d</p><p>Nick opened his mouth to protest, then shut it with a snap of his teeth. \u201cYou\u2019re probably right,\u201d he admitted. A sly smile came over him and he hooked his finger through Kelly\u2019s belt loop. \u201cBut we are a thing.\u201d</p><p>Kelly allowed him a brief kiss, just enough time for him to get back in Kelly\u2019s good graces, then he playfully shoved Nick away and turned to follow after Hagan and JD.</p><p>\u201cMaking out in back alleys!\u201d Hagan called to Nick. \u201cOld habits die hard, huh buddy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me to sleep on a boat?\u201d Hagan asked. \u201cYou remember I get seasick, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you give me a better idea, I\u2019ll run with it,\u201d Nick challenged. He knew it wasn\u2019t a perfect plan, and it wouldn\u2019t hold up for long, but until they had a safe house they could be confident in, he would rather keep JD close.</p><p>JD sat in the hard plastic chair beside their desks, frowning as he listened. \u201cI wonder if I get seasick,\u201d he mused. \u201cI guess we\u2019ll find out.\u201d</p><p>Nick glanced at him, then back at his partner. \u201cWhy does the guy with amnesia who\u2019s been shot at twice in two days complain less than you do?\u201d</p><p>Hagan grumbled and stood, tossing his tie over his shoulder in a huff. He grabbed his empty coffee cup to go off in search of a refill.</p><p>Nick sat back, lacing his fingers behind his head and closing his eyes with a sigh.</p><p>\u201cDetective?\u201d JD whispered. He waited until Nick had opened his eyes again to continue. \u201cWhen the shooting started today, I remembered something.\u201d</p><p>Nick sat forward. \u201cYeah? What was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA face. It like . . . flashed through my mind. I think it might be the guy who shot at me before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you describe him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, dark hair, blue eyes\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to me, to an artist. Hold on.\u201d Nick reached for the phone. \u201cThis is Detective O\u2019Flaherty, Robbery/Homicide. I need an artist up here to work with my witness.\u201d</p><p>The woman gave him confirmation and he hung up, turning his chair so he could face JD. \u201cOkay. So far I\u2019ve got these little threads to this case, and I can\u2019t seem to tie any of them together. I need your help.\u201d</p><p>Fear settled in JD\u2019s eyes in a way Nick felt almost guilty for. He\u2019d been coddling the man, wanting him to feel safe, but someone had tried to put a second bullet in him today. It was time to take off the gloves.</p><p>JD\u2019s jaw hardened, though, and he nodded. \u201cWhatever you need from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to give you three subjects, okay, and you tell me off the top of your head what they have to do with each other.\u201d</p><p>JD\u2019s brow furrowed, but he nodded anyway.</p><p>Nick held up his hand and counted off. \u201cAmerican Revolution. Ireland. Stolen goods.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>JD opened his mouth like he was going to respond, then shut it again, staring off over Nick\u2019s shoulder with a scowl. He opened his mouth again, leaning forward, then sat back and frowned harder. \u201cThe Continental payroll gold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Yeah. The Continental payroll! There was a redcoat lieutenant during the war. The legend is that he and his men intercepted a Continental Army payroll delivery somewhere. Took off with a wagon full of gold bars as it sat at a roadside inn.\u201d</p> <p>Nick ran a finger over one eyebrow, trying not to look skeptical, or worse, annoyed. He was writing all of it down anyway. \u201cOkay. Go on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s . . . that\u2019s all I know. The gold was never recovered.\u201d</p><p>Nick stared at him for a few seconds, and Hagan returned and flopped into his seat, looking between them silently.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Nick said patiently. \u201cWhat does a missing Continental Army payroll have to do with Ireland?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe lieutenant was later revealed to be a supporter of Ireland. He was involved in the Irish Rebellion of 1798.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat are we talking about now?\u201d Hagan asked.</p><p>Nick sighed heavily. \u201cI told him to give me a connection between all our threads. Revolutionary War objects, Irish thugs, and stealing shit.\u201d</p><p>Hagan placed a fresh cup of coffee by Nick\u2019s elbow. He pointed at JD. \u201cYou can\u2019t remember your own name, but you can recite facts about the fucking Irish Rebellion of seventeen whatever it was?\u201d</p><p>JD shrugged one shoulder, looking a little perturbed. \u201cAt least I can remember he doesn\u2019t like coffee,\u201d he said with a jab of his finger at Nick.</p><p>\u201cHa!\u201d Nick barked.</p><p>\u201cFriendly fire,\u201d Hagan said. He put on a fake Irish accent.</p> <p>\u201cJesus, Mary, and Joseph.\u201d</p><p>Nick fired up his computer. \u201cWe\u2019ll just Google this bitch.\u201d</p><p>A few moments later he\u2019d brought up a search page for the British lieutenant\u2019s name. Almost every result was about the lost Revolutionary War treasure. Nick clicked the first one.</p><p>JD moved his chair so he could see the screen too. It was a chat board for amateur treasure seekers, with each post offering theories on where the gold had gone, stories about the poster having gone searching for it somewhere, and the occasional person telling everyone else they were stupid.</p><p>\u201cSee?\u201d JD said. He pointed at one of the posts. \u201cRight here in Boston.\u201d</p><p>Nick looked sideways at him, studying his profile while JD\u2019s attention was elsewhere. It was hard to forget the many warnings that had popped up about JD\u2019s authenticity, including the one from Kelly, but Nick hadn\u2019t felt like he was being lied to once. The man struck him as genuine.</p><p>Kelly cleared his throat as he approached the desk. Nick looked up at him, still scowling thoughtfully.</p><p>\u201cEverything okay?\u201d Kelly asked carefully.</p> <p>\u201cYou know our treasure hunter theory?\u201d Nick asked, wincing at their private joke. Kelly nodded. \u201cWe might have been a little too on the nose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Kelly craned his neck to see the computer. Nick watched his changeable eyes as they darted over the screen, scanning the posts. \u201cStolen Continental payrol ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were paid in gold bars and coins,\u201d JD provided.</p><p>\u201cMeaning if it was hidden somewhere and left there, it\u2019s worth millions today,\u201d Kelly surmised. \u201cYeah okay, that\u2019s worth killing over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore you guys go all Indiana O\u2019Flaherty on me,\u201d Hagan drawled, \u201cwhat does that lost treasure have to do with our case?\u201d</p><p>Nick took a breath to answer, but he realized he didn\u2019t exactly know. They all looked to JD.</p><p>\u201cI . . . I didn\u2019t say it had anything to do with the robbery,\u201d JD reminded them, his blue eyes going wider. \u201cYou gave me three things to associate, I associated them.\u201d</p><p>Kel y sat on the edge of Nick\u2019s desk, turned sideways so he could still see Hagan and the computer screen. \u201cWhat was the other thing stolen from the place? One was the brooch, what was the other?\u201d</p><p>Nick tapped Kelly\u2019s knee to get him to scoot over, and he unlocked the desk drawer beneath him and reached in for the file. He set it on the desk and opened it up to find the photos.</p><p>\u201cIt was a bundle of letters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBundle of letters,\u201d Kelly echoed. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, the brooch I get, it had a few precious gems on it,\u201d Hagan said. \u201cBut the letters are . . . parchment. Tied with twine. No value whatsoever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe value of words is measured by those who read them,\u201d JD told him. He stopped short, scowling hard. \u201cIs that a quote? What is that from? Did I come up with that?\u201d</p><p>Nick almost laughed at him. He bit his lip to keep a straight face instead, and held up the photo the bookstore owner\u2019s daughter had provided of the stolen items. Kelly took it from him, looking it over in silence.</p><p>\u201cThese are Revolutionary War era?\u201d he finally asked. Nick nodded. \u201cDo we know what they said?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe daughter said her father had them transcribed once, because the handwriting was hard to decipher. She\u2019s trying to hunt up the file, said she\u2019d email it when she found it. Why, what are you thinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean, if we go on the theory these people are hunting this lost payroll treasure, this makes sense,\u201d Kelly said with a tap of the photo. \u201cThese are contemporary accounts. And you said one of the books they stole was a soldier\u2019s diary, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, he was at the Battles of Lexington and Concord, and later Bunker Hill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConcord?\u201d JD asked. \u201cAfter their defeat, several British columns broke off and scattered across the countryside as they retreated along Battle Road to Boston. One of those could easily have intercepted a payroll delivery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy hide it instead of making off with it?\u201d Hagan asked.</p><p>\u201cAnd desert the British Imperial Army?\u201d JD shook his head, grinning widely. \u201cMight as well take a knife to the eye, you\u2019d live longer. The theory is they hid it somewhere, intending to come back for it when the war was won.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly they didn\u2019t win the war,\u201d Nick said.</p><p>JD clucked his tongue. He looked pleased with himself for the first time since they\u2019d met him, but the expression faded quickly. He glanced down at his hands, twisting his fingers together.</p><p>\u201cYou okay, bud?\u201d Kelly asked him.</p><p>JD gave them a weak attempt at a smile. \u201cI know more about this than I do about myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do know a lot more about this than most,\u201d Kelly agreed. \u201cAt least you can remember it; that\u2019s a good sign.\u201d</p><p>Nick raised his head as an idea hit him. \u201cDo they fingerprint college professors?\u201d he asked Hagan.</p><p>Hagan pursed his lips. \u201cNot to my knowledge. Some universities are starting to, but only for new hires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSchool\u2019s out, right? What if he\u2019s a professor at a local college? If he lived alone, no one might know he was gone until classes start back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo missing persons report would be filed yet,\u201d Hagan said with a nod.</p><p>\u201cSend his photo out to every institution in a fifty mile radius. See if we can get a hit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn it,\u201d Hagan said, and he lurched out of his chair.</p><p>\u201cCollege professor, huh?\u201d JD said quietly. \u201cNot international treasure thief. You\u2019re awfully optimistic, Detective.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what we love about him,\u201d Kelly said, and when Nick raised his head, Kelly\u2019s eyes were on him, a gentle smile gracing his lips. Nick squeezed his knee, keeping his hand there.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the next move?\u201d JD asked. If he was uncomfortable with Nick and Kelly\u2019s small shows of affection, he didn\u2019t let on.</p><p>\u201cAfter you work with the sketch artist, we\u2019ll get you somewhere safe. The Fiddler\u2019s Green should do the trick, just need to get the captain to sign off on it.\u201d</p><p>JD scowled, biting his lip instead of saying anything.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just . . . if these people are trying to kill me, the only way I\u2019ll really be safe is if they\u2019re caught. We should try to find the treasure they\u2019re after.\u201d</p><p>Nick laughed and scratched at his chin. \u201cFind the treasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight?\u201d JD asked eagerly. \u201cWe find the treasure, we find them, and I don\u2019t have to duck in alleyways anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get you, I do,\u201d Nick offered. \u201cBut I\u2019m a cop, man, not a treasure hunter. I told you I\u2019d keep you safe, that I\u2019d find out who you are, and that\u2019s what I intend to do.\u201d</p><p>JD sat back in his plastic chair, nodding dejectedly. A few moments later the sketch artist arrived, and she took JD into one of the interrogation pods where they could work.</p><p>Kelly slid into the chair, his knee knocking against Nick\u2019s thigh as he slouched. \u201cWhy did you play dumb with him?\u201d</p><p>Kelly asked quietly.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Battle of Bunker Hill. Lexington and Concord.</p><p>Missing treasure right here under your nose in Boston. Look me in the eye and tell me you didn\u2019t know anything about any of that, you goddamn history nerd.\u201d</p><p>Nick\u2019s lips twitched, and he sighed heavily. \u201cI knew I\u2019d regret fucking someone who\u2019s known me for over a decade.\u201d</p><p>Kelly snickered quietly, waiting for an answer.</p><p>\u201cI wanted him to give us the information,\u201d Nick explained.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to see if he\u2019d be right, for one, if he\u2019d omit anything important. Or lie.\u201d</p><p>Kelly remained silent, watching him. Nick slid his hand over Kelly\u2019s knee. \u201cYou\u2019re dying to go digging into that treasure story, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Nick nodded fervently, not even trying to deny it.</p><p>Kelly laughed, throwing his head back. He slumped further in the chair, and his knee slid along Nick\u2019s thigh. Nick cleared his throat and glanced around the room, shifting uncomfortably.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s our real next move?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJulian Cross.\u201d Nick leaned forward, his hand squeezing Kelly\u2019s knee. \u201cHe\u2019s out there for a reason, showing himself; we just need to bring him in. How do you feel about a little bait and switch?\u201d</p><p>Kelly licked his lips, then grinned slowly. \u201cSounds about as fun as you bending me over one of those interrogation desks.\u201d</p><p>Nick groaned and pushed his chair back so they were no longer in contact. \u201cDon\u2019t fucking tempt me, okay? Those rooms have video feeds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Do they record?\u201d</p><p>Nick had to get up and walk away as Kelly laughed merrily at his desk. \u201cYou\u2019re killing me, Kels,\u201d he called over his shoulder. \u201cKilling me!\u201d</p><p>Kelly left before Hagan came back, and before JD was done with the sketch artist. He headed out of the front of the building, taking his time as he strolled toward the parking lot where Nick\u2019s Range Rover was parked. He removed his black leather jacket and tossed it into the car, then rummaged in the backseat for Nick\u2019s green canvas jacket instead. It was too big at the chest, but it didn\u2019t envelop him. He gave his shoulders a shake and pulled the coat tighter around him as he meandered out of the parking lot. He wandered along the quaint little side streets of Boston, enjoying the architecture, window-shopping until he was near the station again. He leaned against the side of a building, standing near a pillar and watching.</p><p>They had put JD in Nick\u2019s suit coat again, covering his shaggy blond hair with the pilfered Red Sox hat and walking him down the back alley behind the police station toward Nick\u2019s Range Rover.</p><p>Nick walked alongside him, his hand loose on JD\u2019s elbow.</p><p>Kelly knew himself well enough to know he was a little jealous of the chemistry Nick and JD seemed to have. But he also knew Nick well enough to know he didn\u2019t need to be worried.</p><p>He reminded himself what he was supposed to be doing, and he glanced around the area, watching the shadows, watching the narrows. Nick was supposed to lead JD into a bottleneck, where a fence jutted out near a big blue dumpster and would force them to veer toward the entrance to a side alley, and that was where Kelly headed.</p><p>He was almost too late. As soon as Nick and JD neared the alley, Nick shoved JD to the side and pulled his gun, obviously seeing something coming out of the corner of his eye.</p><p>Kelly moved with lightning speed, hitting the big man from the side and wrapping him up as they fell. He rolled with him, then let him loose, sending him into an uncontrolled tumble as Kelly hopped to his feet. Before Julian Cross could right himself, Kelly was on him again. He kicked at his chest, and Julian blocked the blow, but he wasn\u2019t fast enough to block the next one when Kelly came up with a roundhouse kick that caught him in the side of the head and sent him sprawling.</p><p>Julian was on his hands and knees, pushing himself to his feet, and Kelly went at him again. Julian was at least four inches taller than he was, but Kelly didn\u2019t care. Size had never fazed him before. He aimed high this time, landing a few blows around the ribs and kidneys, missing a few as Julian blocked them. Then Kelly went in for the kill, leaping at Julian with a kick to the chest that should\u2019ve leveled him. Julian brought up both hands, though, catching Kelly\u2019s foot. Kelly went with the momentum, kicking off the ground and using Julian\u2019s hold on him for leverage. He caught Julian under the chin as he flipped himself backward, and he landed in a crouch several feet from his opponent.</p><p>He was breathing hard, body tense in expectation of Julian getting up again. He heard Nick\u2019s footsteps behind him and he stood slowly. Nick patted him on the shoulder as they both stood over Julian, who was holding his face and lying on his back, cursing in an Irish accent. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s a lot more fun to watch when it\u2019s not me you\u2019re doing it to,\u201d Nick told Kelly, his voice warm with pride and possibly a little lust.</p><p>Kelly smirked at him.</p><p>Nick grabbed Julian by his elbow and hefted him off the ground, then jerked his arms behind him and shoved him against the wall of the nearest building. He patted him down from head to toe, taking special care around his wrists.</p> <p>Kelly wound up holding an armful of weaponry and other . . .</p><p>implements. Then Nick slapped a pair of handcuffs on Julian and hissed in his ear. \u201cWelcome to Boston.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 5</p><p>elly sat in the backseat with Julian, watching him Klike a hawk. Nick could see them in his rearview mirror as he guided the car toward the marina. Any other col ar, and he\u2019d have taken him right back inside to the precinct, but Nick had dealt with Julian Cross before. He wasn\u2019t the type you paraded into a police department without expecting trouble\u2014and probably the CIA\u2014to follow close behind.</p><p>\u201cI thought you were some sort of camp counselor,\u201d Julian finally said to Kelly. \u201cWork with troubled kids and all that.\u201d</p> <p>Kelly pursed his lips. \u201cYeah. It\u2019s called Camp Asskicker.</p><p>I\u2019ll give you a \u2018you tried\u2019 badge next time I see you.\u201d</p><p>Julian snorted and actually smiled before meeting Nick\u2019s eyes in the mirror. \u201cThe handcuffs aren\u2019t really necessary, Detective.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHumor me,\u201d Nick said. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky you\u2019re not in a cell.</p><p>Why are you in Boston? Who\u2019s your mark?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a mark. I\u2019m retired, didn\u2019t Grady tell you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSeeing is believing, babe. And I\u2019ve seen you at not one but two crime scenes in the past two days. So I\u2019ll ask you again, why are you in Boston?\u201d</p><p>Julian sighed, and his eyes darted to JD. \u201cI\u2019d rather speak in private, if it\u2019s all the same to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Nick growled.</p><p>They pulled into the marina parking lot and Nick swiped his security card to open the gates. He could feel the tension pouring off everyone in the car, including himself. It was days like this he sort of wished he\u2019d pulled anchor on his yacht and just sailed into the Atlantic when he\u2019d gotten home.</p><p>They got several double takes and glares from Nick\u2019s neighbors as he led Julian, still handcuffed, toward his boat slip. The Fiddler\u2019s Green was the largest vessel in the marina, and it sat on the very end of the very last dock. They had to walk past basically every other boat in the marina. Nick didn\u2019t care, though. Whenever any of these fuckers had a problem, they came to Detective O\u2019Flaherty to fix it. They could deal with dangerous international criminals being led by in handcuffs every couple of years.</p><p>They boarded the yacht, and Nick shoved Julian toward one of the sofas in the salon. \u201cYou here to talk?\u201d</p><p>Julian nodded. \u201cI still owe you for your previous assistance, Detective. I intend to keep this civil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAttacking them in an alleyway, that\u2019s civil?\u201d Kelly asked.</p> <p>\u201cI believe I was the one who was attacked,\u201d Julian corrected. \u201cYou\u2019ll notice I didn\u2019t take a single swing at you. I was waiting until the detective was away from his partner to approach him.\u201d</p><p>Nick stared at him for several more seconds, then handed Kelly the keys to the handcuffs. \u201cLet him loose. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>Kelly nodded silently, and Julian stood up to give him access to the handcuffs. Nick gestured for JD to follow him toward the lower deck. They both had to duck going down the steps. It was second nature for Nick, but JD bumped his head and cursed quietly, rubbing the spot as he followed Nick to the VIP cabin.</p><p>Nick gestured toward the bed and the bathroom. \u201cMake yourself at home, okay? But stay here until one of us comes to get you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d JD said with a nervous nod. \u201cIs he the one trying to kill me? Are you sure it\u2019s okay to let him go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Nick answered. \u201cAnd no. But we\u2019ll trust him until he proves me wrong.\u201d</p><p>JD met his eyes, and it was obvious from the look on his face that he caught Nick\u2019s meaning. \u201cJust like you\u2019re trusting me. Right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Nick said. \u201cStay here.\u201d</p><p>He left JD, closing the door behind him, and headed back up to join Julian and Kelly in the salon. They were sitting opposite each other, both of them unblinking, both of them smirking slightly.</p><p>Nick put his hands on his hips and took a deep breath to get control of his temper. \u201cOkay,\u201d he said finally. \u201cJulian Cross, this is Kelly Abbott. He kicked your ass once and he\u2019ll do it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgain. I wasn\u2019t fighting back,\u201d Julian reminded. He looked Kelly up and down. \u201cAlthough he does seem quite formidable for his stature.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d Nick said, knowing that nothing Julian could say would ruffle Kelly\u2019s feathers. He sat in the chair beside Kelly and leaned both elbows on his knees, waiting for Julian to begin talking.</p><p>\u201cDo you know who you have in that cabin downstairs?\u201d</p><p>Julian finally asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. Do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, unfortunately.\u201d</p><p>Disappointment spiked hard before Nick could get control of it. He had been resting a lot of hope on Julian being able to shed some light on this. \u201cOkay,\u201d he said through gritted teeth. \u201cSo what do you know?\u201d</p><p>Julian clucked his tongue. \u201cI know what they\u2019re after.\u201d</p><p>Nick and Kelly waited, staring at Julian as he grinned at them.</p><p>\u201cWell, what are you waiting for here, dude, dramatic music?\u201d Kelly finally blurted. \u201cWhat the hell are they after?\u201d</p><p>Julian looked a little annoyed that they hadn\u2019t enjoyed the theatrics. He sat back and pulled his coat away, showing the inside to Nick before he reached in and extracted a folded piece of paper. He unfolded it carefully, then turned it so they could see the photocopied object. \u201cThe crown jewels of Ireland.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrown jewels of Ireland?\u201d Kelly said. \u201cIs that real? That doesn\u2019t sound real.\u201d</p><p>Nick lowered his head, rubbing his face with both hands.</p><p>\u201cThe crown jewels of Ireland disappeared in the early 1900s.</p><p>Why are they stealing documents from the Revolutionary War if that\u2019s what they\u2019re after?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, is this real?\u201d Kelly asked again.</p><p>Nick nodded. \u201cThey were pieces made for the Order of St. Patrick in seventeen . . . something. I don\u2019t remember.</p><p>They disappeared in 1908. After they were stolen, the papers started cal ing them the Irish Crown Jewels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus.\u201d Kelly gaped at Nick. \u201cIs there any obscure piece of history that you don\u2019t know off the top of your head? Seriously!\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, it was 1907,\u201d Julian said. \u201cBut I had to look up the information, so I\u2019m impressed with your knowledge, Detective.\u201d</p><p>Nick rolled his fingers through the air. \u201cGet to the important part.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe order was created in 1783. You\u2019ll notice the proximity to the end of your country\u2019s Revolution.\u201d</p><p>Nick closed his eyes and nodded impatiently. He was still waiting for any of this to connect to anything they\u2019d found.</p><p>\u201cThe jewels, however, were not made until 1831 to replace the original rather plain ones worn by the Order.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about you skip to the end, huh?\u201d Nick demanded.</p><p>Julian glared for a moment, then he shook himself and nodded. \u201cFine. There is a theory that the payroll supposedly stolen from the Continentals at the beginning of the American Revolution was actually not a payroll at al , but rather a small trove of Masonic belongings, including one golden cross.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMasons,\u201d Nick said, gritting his teeth. \u201cYou\u2019re coming at us with Masons?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, what does this cross have to do with the Irish family jewels?\u201d Kelly asked.</p><p>\u201cCrown jewels,\u201d Nick grunted.</p><p>\u201cIf you would let me finish before you get your knickers in a twist, this would be easier.\u201d</p><p>Nick held up both hands and sat with a huff, gesturing for Julian to go on.</p><p>\u201cThe Masons were actually an offshoot of a much older society called the Rosicrucians,\u201d Julian continued. Nick felt Kelly\u2019s eyes on him, and he glanced at his lover questioningly.</p><p>Julian continued, oblivious to their silent communication.</p><p>\u201cThey inspired the Masonic Order of the Golden and Rosy Cross. It\u2019s part of the Scottish Rites, extremely secretive stuff. Many believe there was an actual golden and rosy cross created by the Rosicrucians in the early part of the seventeenth century that was handed down into Masonic hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd people believe it was part of the Continental treasure?\u201d Nick asked.</p><p>\u201cSome, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so important about this cross?\u201d Kelly asked.</p><p>\u201cBesides being really old?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was quite large, purported to have been wrapped in hundreds of layers of gold foil, and encrusted in rare pink diamonds. It would literally be priceless.\u201d</p><p>Nick found himself nodding. He could understand even the rumor of a treasure like that inspiring a certain type of individual. \u201cOkay. I follow. But what does that have to do with the Irish Crown Jewels? Why are they after those instead of this cross?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe main piece in the Irish collection was the Diamond Star of the Grand Master,\u201d Julian said. He laid his paper out and pointed to one of the pieces. \u201cFour square inches of pure white diamond, with a ruby cross and an emerald trefoil in the forefront. Itself worth millions in today\u2019s market, but nothing compared to the value of the golden and rosy cross, if it exists.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. But the Irish Crown Jewels were stolen a hundred years ago, and the Continental treasure and this pink cross disappeared over a hundred years before that. So I say again, where\u2019s the connection?\u201d Nick asked.</p><p>Julian tapped the photo of the Irish Crown Jewels. \u201cThis is a map.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe brooch?\u201d Kelly asked.</p><p>\u201cStar. Technically.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well I say \u2018star\u2019 and it gets all confusing.\u201d</p><p>Julian scoffed. \u201cAre you trying to say you\u2019re not confused already?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is a map to the missing Continental treasure?\u201d Nick asked, tapping the grainy picture.</p><p>\u201cI mean are we talking about the Big Dipper or are we talking about jewelry?\u201d Kelly asked. \u201cIt\u2019s a fucking brooch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour entire Recon team must be insufferable,\u201d Julian muttered to Nick.</p><p>Nick just nodded. \u201cOkay, so the star thingy is a map.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA star map!\u201d Kelly said, grinning widely at Nick. \u201cYou were right, interstellar librarians.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat in the bloody hell . . . no,\u201d Julian growled. \u201cNo interstellar . . . what? No. Whatever you want to call this piece of jewelry, people think it can lead to the Continental treasure, and with it, the actual golden and rosy cross.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great, but the star is gone too,\u201d Nick pointed out.</p><p>\u201cNot entirely,\u201d Julian countered. \u201cBy all accounts, it\u2019s here.</p><p>In Boston.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat accounts?\u201d Nick demanded.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, I\u2019m only being fed information I can use to track it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Julian snarled.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re hunting this treasure for someone else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Julian merely stared at Nick with black eyes that gave away nothing. His jaw was tight. Nick didn\u2019t know him well enough to read him.</p><p>\u201cFine, you\u2019re retired, you need a payday, whatever,\u201d Kelly said with a wave of his hand. \u201cWho hired you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI keep telling you, I don\u2019t know. And if I did, they\u2019d be dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese are people willing to track down and fuck with an ex-CIA hit man for a rumor about a treasure. I\u2019m going to need more than \u2018I don\u2019t know\u2019 from you,\u201d Nick snapped.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all I have!\u201d Julian practically shouted.</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay. Where is the star thing?\u201d Kelly asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. The records that led us here have been lost or stolen. That\u2019s why I was following the men at the bookstore.</p><p>I had hoped they\u2019d gleaned some information I had yet to come across. And when I heard someone had witnessed the robbery, that\u2019s when I decided to contact you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext time, how about just . . . saying hi,\u201d Nick huffed.</p><p>\u201cMaybe a nice text message. I\u2019ll give you my number.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll remember that, Detective,\u201d Julian said between gritted teeth. He put both hands out like he was trying to keep everyone calm. \u201cI am telling you all I have. I am here, in your city, asking for your help.\u201d</p><p>Nick narrowed his eyes.</p><p>Julian inhaled shakily. \u201cBegging. I\u2019m begging for it.\u201d</p><p>That brought Nick up short, his next question forgotten as he stared into Julian\u2019s black eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhy the fuck are you doing all this?\u201d Kelly asked him again.</p><p>Julian lowered his gaze, struggling with his reply. \u201cLet\u2019s just say I had no choice in the matter.\u201d</p><p>A sudden dread came over Nick and he leaned closer.</p><p>\u201cCameron?\u201d</p><p>Julian didn\u2019t move.</p><p>\u201cWho is Cameron?\u201d Kelly asked.</p><p>\u201cMy . . .\u201d Julian shook his head, pursing his lips.</p><p>\u201cHis boyfriend,\u201d Nick provided. \u201cCivilian. Very civilian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not . . .\u201d Julian nearly choked on the words he couldn\u2019t get out. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh shit,\u201d Kelly whispered.</p><p>Julian took a deep breath and raised his head. \u201cWe weren\u2019t careful enough with our location. Cameron made . . . he made a phone call that . . . Anyway. If I don\u2019t find this fucking treasure before someone else does, they\u2019ll kill him.\u201d</p><p>Nick offered to cook for them, but they insisted he order out so he wouldn\u2019t have to bother with it. Kelly wanted to tell Julian and JD that cooking sometimes eased Nick\u2019s nerves, but he kept his mouth shut.</p> <p>Hagan joined them just as the food was getting there, and Nick spent five minutes bitching about how Hagan had a citywide radar set out for free food but couldn\u2019t remember to get him a damn Gatorade instead of coffee in the morning.</p><p>They sat up on the flybridge, eating Thai food and watching the sun set, filling JD and Hagan in as they ate. Kelly kept close enough to Nick to maintain contact surreptitiously. He could feel Nick winding up, and Nick\u2019s peace of mind often fed off contact. Now and then Nick would seek out Kelly\u2019s hand and merely squeeze it, then go back to eating.</p><p>\u201cMasons, Revolutionary treasure, Irish royalty,\u201d Hagan said through a mouthful of food. \u201cI think you\u2019re all insane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet we get a shrink in here, he\u2019d say you\u2019re right,\u201d Nick said. He stretched out, throwing his arm over the back of the bench seat behind Kelly. Kelly put his plate down and leaned into him, resting his feet on a stool off to the side.</p><p>\u201cSo, let me see if I have the timelines correct,\u201d JD said. He was looking down at his food, pushing it around his plate. He hadn\u2019t eaten much. \u201cThe Rosicrucians pop up in Germany in 1600. They\u2019re . . . esoteric, to say the least. They concentrate on learning, secrets of nature, and healing. But they gain enough steam to inspire the Masons two hundred years later, who become a far more prevailing organization. Based more in wealth and power.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo far I\u2019m following,\u201d Hagan commented.</p><p>\u201cThe Masons stretch across the sea to the Americas, they build themselves a country, and they amass a treasure,\u201d JD continued, wincing a little. \u201cAnd then some dumb shit loses it to a British lieutenant and shrugs and says whoops?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve all heard the theories about how the Masons inspired the American forefathers,\u201d Nick said, taking up the timeline. \u201cWhether they\u2019re true or not . . . eh.\u201d He shrugged, wobbling his hand in the air. \u201cBut there are enough proven connections to make me believe in a Colonial treasure trove of Masonic origin. I buy that. But why in God\u2019s name would they pile all that treasure into a wagon, and then cart it into the middle of a war?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey had to have some purpose for it,\u201d Julian mused. \u201cA hiding place. Hell, perhaps they really were using it to pay soldiers.\u201d</p><p>Nick shrugged.</p><p>\u201cMaybe it was a payment for something else,\u201d Kelly suggested. \u201cSomething besides the soldiers.\u201d</p> <p>Nick pursed his lips, humming thoughtfully. \u201cThey were looking for help from the French. They could have been taking it north as oil to grease the wheels of a treaty.\u201d</p><p>Kelly put a hand on Nick\u2019s thigh and let it rest there.</p><p>\u201cOkay, so the treasure is taken, the British soldiers hide it, intending to come back for it. But if the legends are true, they never do. A few years later, King Whoever the Something creates this Order of St. Patrick in Ireland.\u201d Kelly stopped, raising his hand. \u201cSee, that\u2019s where it loses me. Where\u2019s the connection between Colonial treasure, the British getting their asses handed to them, and Ireland?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIreland is part of Britain?\u201d Hagan tried.</p><p>\u201cThe lieutenant who took the treasure was Irish,\u201d JD reminded them. \u201cHe was a member of the Order of St. Patrick.</p><p>And he fought in the Irish Rebellion of 1798. Oh God, that\u2019s so obscure.\u201d</p><p>Nick wrinkled his nose. \u201cLet\u2019s . . . make some assumptions for the sake of argument, here. Dude goes home to Ireland, becomes a knight, and realizes he doesn\u2019t need to deal with the sea crossing again to get to that shit he left back there.</p><p>He\u2019d want to leave a mark, though. He\u2019d want people to know he took it away from the Americans, right? He\u2019d want to somehow let someone know where to find it. Leave clues.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPerhaps that\u2019s where the theft comes in,\u201d Julian offered.</p><p>He\u2019d barely eaten any of his dinner.</p><p>Kelly couldn\u2019t imagine what the man was suffering through, knowing the love of his life was in the hands of ruthless men and still trying to figure out a centuries-old mystery.</p><p>Nick shrugged. \u201cMakes as much sense as anything else.\u201d</p><p>Julian gave a distracted wave.</p><p>\u201cYou know what don\u2019t make sense to me?\u201d Nick continued, his voice still casual but his body tensing against Kelly\u2019s. \u201cWhy they\u2019d tap you for this shit.\u201d</p><p>Julian put his utensils down with care and met Nick\u2019s eyes.</p><p>Nick cocked his head. \u201cHey bud, you don\u2019t have to prep for a fight every time I ask a question. I get it, okay? But I told you I\u2019d help you. I\u2019m not attacking you, you feel me? Just trying to understand.\u201d</p><p>Julian glanced around at them al , then met Nick\u2019s eyes once more and nodded.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not alone in this,\u201d Nick assured him.</p><p>Kelly found himself leaning closer to Nick the more gentle his voice went. Nick squeezed him close, probably not even aware that he was doing it.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t trust anyone,\u201d Julian finally said. \u201cDo understand it\u2019s not personal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough. Your cover was as an antiques dealer, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s correct.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNazi Germany was notorious for archaeological digs in search of religious relics. Do you have anything in your background that would ping you for a job like this? Hunting . . . myths? CIA? IRA?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been assured by a close contact within the Company that the CIA has nothing to do with this, nor do any of the other alphabets I\u2019ve ever crossed. It\u2019s . . . a private matter. That was as much as he was able to glean without putting himself in an awkward position.\u201d</p><p>Nick smiled, laughing silently. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t what I asked.\u201d</p><p>Julian snorted. \u201cFine. I was schooled in the art of relieving artworks of their cages.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were an art thief,\u201d Kelly summed up.</p><p>\u201cVery briefly. And very badly, might I add. It was one of the few things I was caught doing. It would be on a record . . .</p><p>somewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat concerns me is that it wasn\u2019t your shitty art theft abilities that caught someone\u2019s attention,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cI think your purpose is to . . . kill things, pretty much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeftly put,\u201d Julian said with a hint of a smile.</p><p>\u201cWell, someone had the contacts and the information to sniff you out, and to hand you these leads you\u2019ve been following,\u201d Hagan said. His mouth was half-full and he was hurrying through his food. \u201cWhat the hell kind of private citizen has those resources?\u201d</p><p>Nick and Kelly shared a glanced, and Kelly raised an eyebrow. \u201cWhat about Johns? He\u2019s back with that security company, he might have some feelers to put out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s worth a cal ,\u201d Nick said with a curt nod. \u201cI\u2019ll do it after dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d Hagan said. \u201cIf they\u2019re following clues, or hunting for them like they were at the bookstore, they\u2019d have left a trail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Nick asked.</p><p>\u201cIf they\u2019re looking for contemporaneous papers that tell where this treasure is, this isn\u2019t their first robbery. You don\u2019t get from Dublin Castle in Ireland to a bookstore in Boston without a little hint about where to go, know what I mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s where we\u2019ll start tomorrow,\u201d Nick declared, nodding at his partner.</p><p>\u201cStart that search in Dublin,\u201d Julian suggested.</p><p>\u201cOh, and I got the printout of the sketch from the artist JD talked to,\u201d Hagan said, and he stood and patted his pockets down to extract a folded-up piece of paper. He handed it to Nick.</p><p>Nick unfolded it and smoothed it out. Kelly felt Nick\u2019s body tense as soon as he saw the drawing.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Kelly whispered.</p><p>\u201cThis might complicate things a bit.\u201d Nick turned to JD.</p><p>\u201cYou sure this man shot at you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no. It\u2019s just . . . I remembered him when the gunfire started. I have no idea who he is.\u201d</p><p>Nick nodded, eyes on the drawing again. \u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>There was a general outburst of questions from the others, but Nick\u2019s mouth was set in a grim line. He met Julian\u2019s eyes as he turned the drawing around. \u201cIt\u2019s Cam.\u201d</p><p>Julian blanched and snatched the paper from Nick\u2019s hand.</p><p>He stood, staring at it for several beats before turning to JD, his black eyes ablaze.</p><p>\u201cWhoa, whoa!\u201d Kelly shouted, and he and Nick both hopped up to intercept before a fight could break out.</p><p>Nick wrapped Julian up and dragged him toward the edge of the flybridge, his arms around Julian\u2019s massive shoulders, his bare feet digging in to fight the weight of Julian\u2019s struggles.</p><p>Julian might have been one of the few men Kelly\u2019d seen who made Nick look smal . Kelly positioned himself in front of JD, who was watching with wide eyes, confusion written in every line of his face.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s seen Cam!\u201d Julian shouted as he struggled against Nick\u2019s hold. \u201cHe\u2019s been with him, he knows more than he\u2019s saying!\u201d</p><p>Nick finally got him turned around facing the sea, and he was speaking to Julian in a low, urgent voice. His arms went from restraining to comforting, and his voice got loud enough that they could make out his words. \u201cI swear to God, Cross, we\u2019ll find him. I\u2019ll help you find him. But you got to stay calm for me, you got to keep your head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . . I don\u2019t understand. What did I do?\u201d JD asked desperately.</p><p>\u201cYou described the face of his boyfriend,\u201d Kelly explained.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s been kidnapped by the people who are looking for this treasure. Which means you . . . are involved a little more heavily than we were hoping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh Jesus,\u201d JD gasped. He put a hand on Kelly\u2019s shoulder, trying to get past him to get closer to Julian and Nick. Kelly didn\u2019t let him. \u201cI don\u2019t . . . I don\u2019t know what to say. I don\u2019t remember. I\u2019m truly sorry, but I don\u2019t remember!\u201d</p><p>Julian was hanging his head, his knuckles turning white as he grasped the railing. Nick was still murmuring to him, an arm draped over his shoulder.</p><p>Julian finally raised his head and took a deep breath. \u201cOf course,\u201d he managed. He turned around, and Nick carefully stepped away from him, giving him space. \u201cI apologize for my outburst. If you\u2019ll all excuse me, I\u2019m going to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCross,\u201d Nick said before Julian could retreat down the stairwell. Julian stopped. \u201cI\u2019ll hunt them down like he was mine. I promise.\u201d</p><p>Julian locked eyes with Nick, his expression unreadable.</p><p>He descended the steps without another word, leaving the rest of them in an awkward silence.</p><p>The sun had set on them, the flickering of several citronella lanterns and the soft glow of the quaint caf\u00e9 bulbs Nick always strung along the flybridge in the summer the only remaining light.It was incredibly romantic, bobbing out in the harbor, the city of Boston twinkling in the distance. Kelly just wished they were alone instead of sharing the yacht with three other men and breaking up fights and hunting treasure and this was bullshit. Hell, they might as well have called Sidewinder in and slept in puppy piles on pool floats like they used to.</p><p>JD seemed to be trying to catch his breath as Julian disappeared down the steps and closed the hatch behind him.</p><p>\u201cOh God,\u201d he whispered. \u201cIs it possible I\u2019m the one who . . .\u201d</p><p>Nick trudged back over to his seat and flopped down. \u201cIt\u2019s best not to linger on that just yet.\u201d</p><p>JD had a hand over his mouth, and he looked positively ill. He finally cleared his throat and asked, \u201cHow do you not linger on that? How?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have some Valium,\u201d Nick offered.</p><p>Kelly winced. \u201cBad idea, very bad with the amnesia thing.</p><p>Nope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I need to . . . try to sleep,\u201d JD practically croaked.</p><p>\u201cGood night.\u201d</p><p>Kelly let him pass by as they all murmured good-nights to him. Then he joined Nick on the seat and leaned back into Nick\u2019s arm, sighing heavily.</p><p>\u201cWhat a fucking mess,\u201d he said quietly. Nick nodded beside him.</p><p>They turned their attention to Hagan, who was stretched out on the chaise across from them, finishing his beer. He grinned mischievously. \u201cWell aren\u2019t we cozy,\u201d he drawled.</p><p>Kelly snorted. Nick rubbed his fingers across his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou two go on. I can\u2019t take the sexual tension anymore,\u201d Hagan teased. He tapped the cooler next to him. \u201cI\u2019ll keep first watch.\u201d</p><p>Nick stood and pulled Kelly to his feet. \u201cYou asked for it,\u201d Nick growled to Hagan.</p><p>\u201cBe a good neighbor, O\u2019Flaherty,\u201d Hagan called as Kelly and Nick made their way down the steps. \u201cMuffle the screams!\u201d</p><p>Nick sat and stared at the file before him. He\u2019d tried going to bed, but after only a few minutes Kelly had told him to get out because he kept tossing and turning. So he\u2019d headed back up to the salon and gotten into his notes. He\u2019d promised JD he would find out who he was, he\u2019d promised Julian he would find Cameron, and both pledges haunted him. His fingers trembled as he leafed through his papers, and he gritted his teeth. He\u2019d mostly gotten the hand tremor under control, but when it returned, it meant he was wearing himself too thin. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He\u2019d been going over every little detail he\u2019d managed to glean in the past two days, trying to piece them together, trying to make sense of them. It seemed like the more he tried to force his brain to work, the less he managed to come up with, and the more frustrated he got.</p><p>His cell phone began to sing, a raucous fiddle tune that belonged to only one person in his contacts. Definitely the only one who would call him this late at night. Nick glanced at the phone, Ty Grady\u2019s picture on the display. He let it go to voice mail, though the song grated on his mind because he\u2019d always reached to answer that call before. He still hadn\u2019t forgiven Ty for the last two debacles they\u2019d gotten themselves into, for the lies his friend had told him, and frankly he didn\u2019t really feel like talking to the man much lately. He almost immediately felt guilty for not answering, though, and he picked up the phone to check the message.</p><p>It was curt and to the point, just like Ty. \u201cHey, Irish.</p> <p>Haven\u2019t heard from you in a while. I\u2019m starting to get worried, so give me a cal .\u201d</p><p>Nick shook his head and hit the button to call back. He kept in touch with his Recon boys, usually sending at least a text or something every few days. But he couldn\u2019t remember the last time he\u2019d been compelled to send Ty anything. The feeling of having lost something precious made his chest ache, but it was tempered with so much anger he tried not to touch it at al .</p><p>\u201cYou better be shacked up with something spectacular,\u201d Ty said in greeting.</p><p>Nick huffed before he could stop himself. He put the phone on speaker and set it on the table. \u201cI am, actually. Doc is in town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. I take the spectacular comment back, then. Gross,\u201d Ty nearly whined. \u201cWhat have y\u2019all been up to? Zane said you called him today.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI did, needed some info.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know things too, Irish. You couldn\u2019t call me? Say a fucking hello or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Ty, I\u2019m working a case. It\u2019s a little off. Haven\u2019t had much time for small talk.\u201d</p><p>Ty cleared his throat, wordlessly acknowledging the dig.</p><p>Nick had always had time for Ty before. \u201cFair enough. What kind of off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing like the crap you get up to, but weird enough for me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou want to tell me about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s late, Ty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got time.\u201d</p><p>Nick stared at the phone, wishing with all his heart that talking to his oldest and dearest friend didn\u2019t feel so hard. He took a deep breath and nodded. He told Ty about JD, about finding him at the scene and his memory loss. He told him about trying to decipher the bits and pieces of information he\u2019d gathered and make sense of whether JD was friend or foe. He didn\u2019t mention Julian at al . Julian had asked him to keep it quiet, and Nick was nothing if not good on his word.</p><p>Finally, he told him about the suspicions that the basis of the case came down to missing treasure. Ty perked up at that.</p><p>\u201cTreasure sounds fun,\u201d he said, tone hopeful. Since Ty had resigned from his job at the Bureau, he was going a little stir-crazy. He\u2019d probably love it if Nick asked him to come to Boston to hunt for missing treasure.</p><p>Nick stared at the phone, trying to find the urge to invite him, trying to find the genuine desire to want Ty here to help them. \u201cYeah,\u201d he finally said, voice a little choked. \u201cYou\u2019d think, but it\u2019s not. Not when my only witness is a fucking John Doe.\u201d</p><p>Ty was silent, mul ing it over. \u201cYou should get a shrink in to question him,\u201d he finally suggested, his voice losing a little of its buoyancy. \u201cTry to trip him up if he\u2019s faking.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, he\u2019s got an appointment with one in the morning.</p><p>Guy I\u2019ve been going to, I trust his judgment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou been seeing a shrink?\u201d Ty asked.</p><p>\u201cMy hands don\u2019t shake as much anymore. Worth the hour a week,\u201d Nick said, voice going colder.</p><p>Ty was silent for a long, tense moment. \u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d he finally said in a rush, sounding like he was trying to catch up to the conversation. \u201cThat\u2019s good, it\u2019s good. So your amnesia guy, what\u2019s your take on him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s faking. I mean, could you pull that off 24/7 and never once slip?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever tried,\u201d Ty said in all seriousness. \u201cAnd you have nothing on him? Is he at least local? Does he have an accent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, about that. I never heard this accent before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like . . . Southern with a curlicue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Ty was laughing, but Nick didn\u2019t find his frustration all that amusing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious. It\u2019s like yours, but not. Like he came over from England and put the two accents together. I . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you mimic him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! I\u2019ve tried, and my tongue does not make that sound with an R.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour tongue can\u2019t make any kind of an R!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever, hillbilly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if you want, send me a recording tomorrow or let me talk to him. Maybe I can pump my FBI contact for info.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, Ty, we\u2019ve talked about Garrett and the sex jokes.\u201d</p><p>Ty snickered. \u201cI\u2019m serious. If I don\u2019t recognize it, maybe Zane can get it to the linguistics people at the Bureau. They owe me a few favors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you listen to him now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, like right now? You have a recording of him sitting around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I have him.\u201d</p><p>Ty was silent for a few breaths. When he spoke again, all teasing was put aside. \u201cYou have your suspect on your boat with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe might be a suspect, there\u2019s a difference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMight and suspect are synonymous, Irish! They mean the same thing!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTy\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe \u2018might\u2019 is implied in the \u2018suspect\u2019!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s also a witness and could possibly be a victim himself,\u201d Nick said calmly, trying to head off what he recognized would be a pretty impressive Grady rant. \u201cWe don\u2019t know. Someone took a shot at him today. Right outside a cop bar, Ty. We had to move him from his safe house, and my boat is the safest place in the fucking city. He\u2019s either a witness in need of protecting, or he\u2019s a doer in need of\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeing in jail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up. We\u2019re trying to get his memory back, and he needs the right environment for it. Not to be sitting in some cell, alone, thinking he\u2019s a bad guy. He just needs to remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, so when he remembers that he kills people\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTy, I had this conversation with my superiors today; shut up and be helpful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Go get him, I\u2019ll talk to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe right back.\u201d Nick got up and turned to head for the stairs. He stopped short and his hand immediately went to the gun in the holster on his hip when he found JD standing in the stairwell, his eyes just showing over the railing. Nick had been so caught up with his conversation, he\u2019d allowed JD to get the drop on him. Goddamn.</p><p>\u201cI . . . I couldn\u2019t sleep and I was feeling claustrophobic,\u201d JD explained as quickly as he could. \u201cHagan told me earlier he\u2019d be keeping watch upstairs, that it\u2019d be okay for me to . . .</p><p>I heard you talking so I came to see who was with you, but I didn\u2019t . . . I didn\u2019t want to intrude.\u201d He seemed to be trying not to look at the gun Nick was still gripping, but his eyes strayed to Nick\u2019s hip anyway.</p><p>Nick breathed out a long, slow breath and nodded, letting his hand leave his weapon. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. Next time give me a little more noise, huh? Come here.\u201d</p><p>JD took the last few steps, looking worried. Nick knew the man must have heard the last part of his and Ty\u2019s conversation, but it wasn\u2019t anything he hadn\u2019t already been told or even said himself.</p><p>\u201cThis is my buddy Ty; Kelly and I were telling you about him earlier,\u201d Nick said as he pointed at the phone sitting on the table. \u201cHe\u2019s good with linguistics, he thinks maybe he can help us with your accent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat accent?\u201d JD asked with a frown.</p><p>Nick laughed and put a hand on his shoulder, knowing the contact would calm him.</p><p>\u201cJD, is it?\u201d Ty\u2019s voice was small on the speaker, and they both sat and bent their heads toward it.</p><p>Ty asked JD to repeat a few sentences for him, ending with \u201cThe Boston Red Sox suck pavement, and the designated hitter was a sham.\u201d</p><p>JD was laughing as he said it, and he looked at Nick apologetically when he finished.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Ty said, sounding pleased with himself. \u201cI think I got what I needed.\u201d</p><p>Nick picked up the phone and switched the speaker off.</p><p>He glanced at JD. \u201cI\u2019ve got a few more things to talk over with him.\u201d</p><p>JD nodded, getting up to head back down without saying a word.</p><p>Nick watched until his head disappeared below, then put the phone to his ear. \u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Tidewater.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis accent. It\u2019s Tidewater.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Virginia, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, near the coast. Maybe as far west as Richmond, but not by much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a pretty narrow field to put it down to. Thanks, babe, that\u2019s solid.\u201d</p><p>Ty hummed into the phone. \u201cThis getting us closer to even?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t start with this shit, Ty, not right now,\u201d Nick grunted.</p><p>\u201cIf not now, then when?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got to go,\u201d Nick said. He pulled the phone away, but Ty\u2019s voice stopped him.</p><p>\u201cHey Nick?\u201d</p><p>Nick took a steadying breath and closed his eyes, putting the phone to his ear again. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just . . . be careful, okay?\u201d</p><p>Nick nodded, rol ing his eyes. \u201cGot it.\u201d</p><p>Nick hung up the phone before Ty could say more. He was tired of dealing with that heartache for tonight. He slid the phone into his pocket and glanced down the stairs with a frown. JD had obviously come up here for something, and Nick wasn\u2019t buying the \u201cI need air\u201d excuse. He looked over the railing into the lower deck of his boat. He knew Julian was in one of the bunks, with Hagan keeping an eye on things from up top until it was Nick\u2019s watch.</p><p>He headed down the steps, listening intently, expecting JD to have returned to the VIP cabin to sleep. He came up short when he reached the bottom of the stairs and almost bowled JD over.</p><p>\u201cSorry!\u201d he whispered as he grabbed the man\u2019s arm to steady him. \u201cWhat are you doing? Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>JD nodded. \u201cYeah, I . . . I was just looking at your pictures.\u201d</p><p>Nick glanced at the frames that lined the wal .</p><p>\u201cHow long were you a Marine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTen years,\u201d Nick answered. JD was staring at the pictures, his sharp eyes taking them in, studying them. Nick knew every photo on the wal , but he rarely slowed to look at them anymore. Most were of him in uniform, and almost every one had Ty Grady in it. They had been best friends for so long, it was almost impossible to find a shot of Nick without him.</p><p>Kelly was in many of them as well, and he and Nick had always gravitated toward each other. Nick often wondered if they\u2019d just been completely blind to the attraction all those years, or if the connection they shared went beyond romance or attraction.</p><p>Nick stared at Kelly\u2019s smiling face for a long time before turning his attention back to JD, wondering at his intent interest. \u201cAre you . . . remembering something? You think you were in service somehow? We could run your prints again, expand the search.\u201d</p><p>A blush crept over JD\u2019s face. \u201cNo. Me? God no. I mean, you saw how I reacted when the gunfire started.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, ducking and covering is the smart move, so no judgment on my part.\u201d</p><p>They both laughed, albeit uncomfortably, and Nick ran a hand over his chin as he scanned the photos again. \u201cYour accent is Tidewater,\u201d he told JD. \u201cMeans you spent at least most of your youth in Virginia, near the coast. That area is naval base central. These pictures might be attracting you because you were a Navy brat.\u201d</p><p>JD shook his head. He hesitated for a moment, then glanced at Nick and gave him an embarrassed smile. \u201cI was just looking at you.\u201d</p><p>Nick\u2019s eyebrows jumped, and he grinned crookedly.</p><p>\u201cWell, we were all young and handsome at some point.\u201d</p><p>When Nick glanced at the array of pictures, he could feel JD\u2019s eyes still on him. Nick met his gaze with a growing sense of dread.</p><p>\u201cI prefer you now,\u201d JD whispered.</p><p>Nick had no idea what to say. He couldn\u2019t turn away from the other man. He was drawn to him, to the mystery, to the distress, to those hypnotic blue eyes. Just like a puppy in a storm drain.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Nick said evenly as he lowered his head. \u201cBut that\u2019s a very bad idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you\u2019re right, I\u2014I\u2019m sorry, totally inappropriate,\u201d JD said in a rush. He put his hand over his mouth and took a step toward the VIP cabin, looking away and then back at Nick.</p><p>They stood staring at each other for a long moment.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s incredibly lucky, Detective,\u201d JD finally whispered.</p><p>\u201cSo am I,\u201d Nick said gently.</p><p>JD gave him a small smile before he retreated into his cabin. Nick stared at the doorway for a long moment before cursing under his breath and turning away.</p><p>Kelly sat in the salon, watching Nick move around the outside of the boat in the darkness. Reports of gale-force winds were coming in, and he probably didn\u2019t want to wake up to a sinking vessel, especially since parts were still riddled with buckshot. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kelly had Nick\u2019s book in his lap, reading it in the light coming from beneath the galley cabinets.</p><p>When Julian had mentioned the Rosicrucians, Nick hadn\u2019t even flinched, although he\u2019d obviously felt Kelly\u2019s eyes on him. What the hell was Nick up to? Kelly hated being out of the loop, and he hated even more feeling suspicious of his boyfriend.</p><p>He flipped through the pages until he came to the one bookmarked by the slip of paper he\u2019d found the other night, the one with the pigpen cipher on it.</p> <p>He still had it in his hand when Nick stepped into the salon and shuttered the doors and windows. Kelly watched him silently, waiting until Nick became aware of his presence.</p><p>Nick finished the last lock and turned, taking a sip of water from a plastic Red Sox cup that was half-faded from so many washings. He stopped short when he found Kelly sitting on the love seat.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he whispered. \u201cWhat are you doing up, are you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t sleep,\u201d Kelly admitted.</p><p>\u201cMakes two of us.\u201d Nick came around the coffee table and thumped down beside Kelly on the sofa. He handed Kelly his water, and Kelly took a sip before giving it back.</p> <p>\u201cAre you reading in the dark?\u201d Nick asked with a quiet laugh.</p><p>Kelly held the book up. \u201cWhy are you playing this so close to the vest?\u201d</p><p>Nick frowned, the shadows casting lines across his face.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about? What is that?\u201d He tilted the book toward the light, trying to read the title.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a book about secret societies.\u201d Kelly leaned across Nick and turned the lamp on. He set the book in Nick\u2019s lap.</p><p>\u201cYou knew what Cross was talking about earlier. What are you up to?\u201d</p> <p>Nick picked it up, glancing at the paper in Kelly\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d he said, sounding hurt.</p><p>\u201cNick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKels. The department puts on a summer camp every year.\u201d Nick tossed Kelly a wounded look. \u201cI was on desk duty for weeks until I was cleared by the liver docs, so they put me on it. I\u2019m making up a scavenger hunt for them. I\u2019m running out of ideas, so I was trying to think up new clues.\u201d</p><p>Kelly pointed at the cipher. \u201cThis is a clue for a kid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I got the book out because the example they have of that symbol there is kind of ornate,\u201d Nick said. He flipped to the right page and tapped the drawing in the book. \u201cI traced it, then added symbols from the other clues in the scavenger hunt. It looks like gibberish to us, but the kids will know what the symbols mean by the time they find that one.\u201d</p><p>Kelly bit his bottom lip, trying to smile. He just nodded instead. Of course Nick wasn\u2019t up to anything nefarious. He was making a game for kids. Kids he claimed to not be fond of. Kelly finally huffed.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d you think I was doing?\u201d Nick asked with a teasing smirk.</p> <p>Kelly shook his head, embarrassed to have brought it up.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even know. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Nick set his cup down, then leaned back, sinking into the soft couch. He put his feet up on the table and raised his arm for Kelly to lean against him. Kelly did so gladly, resting his feet next to Nick\u2019s and his head against Nick\u2019s shoulder. He covered them both with the blanket Nick kept on the sofa.</p><p>Nick squeezed him, then buried his nose in Kelly\u2019s hair.</p><p>\u201cI promise the next time I\u2019m doing anything wicked, you\u2019ll be my partner in crime,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Kelly snorted. \u201cIt\u2019s sad how true that is, dude.\u201d</p><p>They stayed that way for a long while, with Nick\u2019s arm wrapped around Kelly and Kelly\u2019s head on his chest. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about this,\u201d Nick finally said.</p><p>\u201cWhat for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis case. It\u2019s ruining our time together. I should have taken vacation days.\u201d</p><p>Kelly turned so he could see Nick. He rested his chin on Nick\u2019s chest, peering up at him. \u201cI think we needed this,\u201d Kelly admitted.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we\u2019re based off murder and mayhem.\u201d Kelly pushed up, sitting cross-legged and facing Nick. \u201cWe\u2019ve never known each other in times of peace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure we have,\u201d Nick argued. He tried to sit up, but Kelly put a hand on his chest and shoved him back down. For some reason it was easier to talk to Nick when he was lounging, wearing a pair of Red Sox pajama bottoms and little else.</p><p>\u201cNo we haven\u2019t,\u201d Kelly countered. \u201cEven after being discharged, every time we got together, we got in trouble.</p><p>Or we made trouble. It\u2019s in our nature, babe. And then New Orleans happened. It took me taking a bullet in the chest and almost dying to realize I was attracted to you. I just . . . I think our foundations are built on gunpowder and I\u2019m just afraid they\u2019re going to . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cKels,\u201d Nick whispered. \u201cJesus Christ, are you breaking up with me right now? Because that\u2019s kind of what this feels like.\u201d</p><p>Kelly smiled gently. \u201cDo you want me to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, no!\u201d Nick sat up again, and this time Kelly didn\u2019t stop him. \u201cI swear to God, we\u2019ll go somewhere soon where it\u2019s not fucking possible for us to be shot at. Vacation in . . . Amish country or something. I\u2019ll prove we don\u2019t need it.\u201d</p><p>Kelly laughed and shook his head. Nick gripped the back of his neck, pul ing their faces closer. \u201cIf our foundations are built on gunpowder, then so be it. They\u2019re foundations all the same.\u201d</p><p>Then his fingers loosened, and he dragged his thumb over Kelly\u2019s cheekbone, letting the backs of his fingers drift along Kelly\u2019s jaw and then trailing the tips down his neck.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d Nick whispered. \u201cHas nothing to do with the circumstances, or our history, or how close to death we\u2019ve come together. I would love you in any incarnation of yourself.\u201d</p><p>Kelly hadn\u2019t been expecting such a heartfelt declaration from his lover, who usually erred on the side of humor when something needed to be said. He found it hard to swallow, and he couldn\u2019t tear his eyes away from Nick\u2019s.</p><p>The longer Kelly\u2019s brain chugged for a response, the softer and more amused Nick\u2019s expression became. He finally ran his thumb across Kelly\u2019s lower lip, then pulled it down like he was making Kelly talk. \u201cLove you too,\u201d he said in a poor imitation of Kelly\u2019s voice.</p><p>They both burst out laughing, quieting quickly so they wouldn\u2019t wake the others. Kelly wiped his lips and reached for Nick, pul ing him in for a kiss. \u201cYou\u2019re fucking insane,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>Nick nodded, and he wound his arms around Kelly\u2019s waist and dragged him closer. He leaned back again, stretching out on the couch. Kelly lay out on top of him, kissing him for all he was worth. He had the presence of mind, though, to remember that he hadn\u2019t finished making his point yet. He\u2019d been awake when Nick and JD had been outside the cabin door talking. He\u2019d heard their conversation. He pushed up, frowning down at Nick.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Nick asked, voice full of dread. \u201cAre you seriously going to try to break up with me twice in five minutes?\u201d</p><p>Kelly chuckled and shook his head. \u201cI just want . . . I want you to know if you wanted to try something else\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cKelly!\u201d Nick sat up again, taking Kelly with him despite Kelly trying to shove him back down. He had his arm wrapped around Kelly\u2019s waist, and he rolled him into the back of the couch, pinning him against the cushions. Kelly didn\u2019t try to fight it, and soon enough Nick had him under him.</p><p>Nick\u2019s face was shadowed, but Kelly could still see his almost desperate frown. \u201cI\u2019m not here with you because I don\u2019t have other options. You understand? This is not something I\u2019m taking lightly, it\u2019s not a jaunt through the park for me.\u201d</p><p>Kelly licked his lips, trying to swallow. His mouth was too dry.</p><p>\u201cDoc. There is no \u2018something else\u2019 for me. There\u2019s no second option. It\u2019s you. It\u2019s just you.\u201d</p><p>Nick rested on his elbow so he could glide a finger across Kelly\u2019s cheek. It brought their faces closer together. Kelly lifted his head and kissed him, almost exploratory, tentative and gentle. Nick returned it with the same tender attention, holding Kelly\u2019s chin between his thumb and forefinger.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Kelly whispered after several long moments of the lingering kiss. \u201cOkay. So let\u2019s go downstairs and you can prove it to me.\u201d</p><p>Nick hummed contentedly. \u201cAs you wish.\u201d</p><p>They had the presence of mind to finish battening down the hatches and for Nick to wake Hagan for the last shift before they headed down to their cabin, and they also had the presence of mind to be quiet when they reached the cabin. Barely. Nick pressed Kelly against the wal , holding him tightly with one arm, meeting his lips over and over as he closed the door with a quiet snick.</p><p>Kelly wrapped both arms around his neck and lifted one leg to hitch it over Nick\u2019s hip. He was still exploring all the ways that sex with a guy was new. Some things he loved, other things he missed. But one thing he would never get enough of was the size difference between him and Nick. He loved the fact that he had to reach up to kiss him, that Nick\u2019s muscles were bulkier than his own. He especially enjoyed that Nick could pick him up, and did so with great frequency during their foreplay. He\u2019d once briefly fucked Kelly that way, holding him against a wall and entering him over and over until he\u2019d wanted harder and faster and tossed Kelly onto a nearby couch instead.</p><p>Needless to say, Kelly had learned the little cues that Nick responded to, and he abused the hell out of them.</p><p>Nick grabbed the back of Kelly\u2019s thigh as soon as he raised his leg, and then he bent and hefted Kelly up, sliding his back 116 against the wall and holding him there with his own weight.</p><p>Kelly wrapped both legs around him, still kissing him.</p><p>He could feel Nick growing harder through his pajama pants, feel the tension in every muscle as he worked to support Kelly\u2019s weight.</p><p>\u201cBabe,\u201d Kelly gasped. \u201cWhat do I have to do to get you to fuck me like this?\u201d</p><p>Nick chuckled darkly. \u201cI\u2019d be way too fucking loud doing that,\u201d he admitted, then bit at Kelly\u2019s lip and kissed him hungrily. He put his lips to Kelly\u2019s ear and hissed, \u201cCome ride me.\u201d</p><p>Kelly groaned. \u201cYes, Staff Sergeant.\u201d</p><p>Nick released the viselike grip he\u2019d had on Kelly and let him slide to the ground. As soon as his feet were on the floor, Kelly ran his hands under Nick\u2019s shirt. He\u2019d probably seen Nick shirtless a thousand times before, but this never failed to be his favorite part of getting Nick undressed. The play of muscles on his shoulders and his back, the way the dark ink of his tattoos contrasted with his skin. It was fucking glorious.</p><p>Nick pulled the shirt off and tossed it aside, backing toward the bed with a smirk. He knew what he did to Kelly, but he wasn\u2019t afraid to return the favor and show Kelly he was turned on. He shoved his pants past his hard cock, leaving them when they hit his thighs.</p><p>\u201cGoddamn it,\u201d Kelly hissed, and he yanked his own shirt over his head. He shoved his sweatpants down and kicked out of them.</p><p>Nick was watching him, his eyes predatory, licking his lips as he looked Kelly up and down. Kelly elbowed him to the bed, then climbed on top of him and pinned his hands.</p><p>Nick grinned evilly, lifting his hips so the head of his cock brushed against Kelly\u2019s balls.</p><p>Kelly shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to work harder for it than that.\u201d</p><p>When Nick smiled, Kelly could see that he was biting his tongue. \u201cYou sure about that?\u201d Nick asked slyly. \u201cLast time you rode me, you came so hard I licked it off my lips.\u201d</p><p>Kelly groaned and hung his head. It was true, damn him.</p><p>He released Nick\u2019s hands and reached for the pillows where they\u2019d been stashing their lube. The drawer was just so far when they got to the stage where they needed it.</p><p>As he was reaching, Nick grabbed his hips, holding him in place. He licked at the tip of Kelly\u2019s cock, his fingers digging into Kelly\u2019s ass.</p><p>\u201cOh God, babe,\u201d Kelly grunted. He hung his head, gasping as his entire body pulsed with need.</p><p>Nick tugged at his hips, urging Kelly to crawl just a little closer to the headboard. He licked Kelly\u2019s balls, then went lower, lapping at Kelly\u2019s asshole. Kelly almost shouted. He brought his fist up and bit it to keep from making any noise.</p><p>Nick licked all the way up to Kelly\u2019s balls again and sucked one into his mouth.</p><p>Kelly arched his back, reaching down to grab a handful of Nick\u2019s hair. His thighs were beginning to burn, but goddamn if he was going to worry about that when Nick was about to do what Kelly thought he was.</p><p>Nick\u2019s hands squeezed at Kelly\u2019s ass, pul ing his cheeks apart before his tongue was there again, licking and massaging muscles that kept fighting back as Kelly tensed.</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ, you do tongue exercises when I\u2019m not around, don\u2019t you?\u201d Kelly said, the last word coming out a moan as Nick\u2019s tongue shoved past those muscles and inside him.</p><p>Nick hummed in response, and licked his way up to Kelly\u2019s balls again. His teeth scraped tender skin, and a small whimper escaped Kelly\u2019s lips before he could stop himself.</p><p>He squirted a liberal amount of lube into his palm, then reached blindly behind him. He grasped Nick\u2019s hard cock and squeezed, coating it with lubricant. Nick moaned loudly, but this time he had a mouthful of Kelly\u2019s balls and Kelly almost came right then and there. His cock was dripping as he contorted his body, trying to jack Nick while still giving Nick\u2019s tongue access. Nick licked at his asshole again, then dragged his tongue all the way up the shaft of Kelly\u2019s cock.</p><p>He sucked him between his lips, licking the pre-cum off the head before releasing him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As soon as he was free, Kelly backed his ass into Nick, kissing him as he rubbed himself all over Nick\u2019s slick cock.</p><p>Nick\u2019s hand tangled in Kelly\u2019s hair and he shoved his hips toward Kelly with a groan. \u201cCome on,\u201d he urged. His voice was as strained as his body was beneath Kelly.</p><p>Kelly grinned and lowered himself, rubbing his ass against the head of Nick\u2019s cock. \u201cLike this?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cKels,\u201d Nick practically begged. He raised his hips, and the head of his cock slid along Kelly\u2019s ass with ease. Kelly pushed back, letting Nick almost enter him without even needing to guide him. Nick gasped and dug his fingers into the muscle of Kelly\u2019s ass. \u201cFuck, babe.\u201d</p><p>Kelly kissed him again, licking at his tongue, sucking on it, biting it. Nick whimpered into his mouth and shoved his hips up again when Kelly wouldn\u2019t release his tongue. He entered Kelly this time, and they both groaned wantonly. The head of his cock pushed at Kelly, spreading him apart. It inched into him, and the friction was enough to make anyone scream for more. Kelly sat down hard, and Nick shoved deep inside him.</p><p>Neither of them could cry out since they were still fighting over who got to keep Nick\u2019s tongue. Kelly kissed him one more time and sat up, shifting his hips as Nick sank balls deep inside him.</p><p>\u201cFuck, I remember why this was so fun now,\u201d Kelly moaned as he let his head fall back. Nick\u2019s hands were all over him, gliding up his ribs, smoothing across his chest, pulling him down by his shoulders as he tried to push deeper into him.</p><p>Kelly began a slow, rhythmic roll of his hips, and both of them writhed with pleasure. Nick brought his knees up, shoving into him as Kelly moved. It gave just one more dimension to the friction that was setting them both on fire.</p> <p>Kelly dragged his nails down Nick\u2019s chest. \u201cDon\u2019t stop,\u201d he ordered breathlessly.</p><p>Nick bit his lip and nodded. \u201cFuck!\u201d he hissed. He gripped Kelly\u2019s hips tight. \u201cFuck, I knew we wouldn\u2019t be able to do this quiet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck quiet,\u201d Kelly grunted. He fought against Nick\u2019s hold, moving his hips anyway. Nick grunted, sucking air through his teeth as he started the slow thrusts again.</p><p>There was nothing to cover the sound of their lovemaking.</p><p>No white noise, no rough ocean, no music or city sounds in the distance. It was just Nick, Kelly, and the gasps and grunts each of them made as they drew closer and closer to release.</p><p>There was no way the others wouldn\u2019t hear them if they were awake. And Kelly didn\u2019t care. In fact, he almost saw it as a chance to mark his territory.</p> <p>Nick\u2019s nails dragged across Kelly\u2019s ribs, grasping at him desperately, blindly seeking out a handhold.</p><p>\u201cYou coming?\u201d Kelly asked, barely able to say the words over the struggle against his own orgasm.</p><p>\u201cKelly,\u201d Nick gasped. The name sounded like a curse on his lips. He bucked his hips, pushing Kelly almost off the bed. Kelly laid a hand in the middle of Nick\u2019s chest, where he could feel the wild beating of Nick\u2019s heart as he came. He squeezed every muscle he could still control and Nick cried out, a hoarse, desperate plea of Kelly\u2019s name.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, babe,\u201d Kelly hissed.</p><p>Nick had his eyes closed, his head thrown back. He gritted his teeth so he wouldn\u2019t shout again. God, he was fucking beautiful when they fucked. Kelly could feel every straining muscle in Nick\u2019s powerful body, the possessiveness in his grasp, see the love and pleasure in his eyes when he met Kelly\u2019s, could feel his cock pulsing inside him. He gripped himself with his free hand, and all it took were a few strokes before he found his own release.</p><p>He knelt over Nick with his head hanging for long minutes, each of them trying to catch his breath, each of them slowly recommencing their gentle strokes and touches as their bodies calmed. Kelly finally managed to move, lifting himself off Nick and then col apsing beside him in bed.</p><p>Nick didn\u2019t move other than to rest his hand on Kelly\u2019s thigh and squeeze. Kelly took in his profile in the glaring light. He placed his hand over Nick\u2019s heart again, feeling it slow.\u201cI\u2019m sorry I questioned this,\u201d Kelly said as he tapped Nick\u2019s chest.</p><p>Nick opened one eye, then turned his head to meet Kelly\u2019s eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s okay to question, Kels. But I promise I\u2019ll never give you a reason to.\u201d</p> <p>Kelly kissed him gently, then rolled to his back again.</p><p>\u201cWho gets the light and the towel?\u201d he asked after a few seconds. \u201cI have spunk dripping out of my ass and it\u2019s your fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it is,\u201d Nick said, sounding pretty pleased with himself.</p><p>\u201cPretty sure you should have to get the towel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoshambo,\u201d Nick said, and he held his fist up, waiting.</p><p>Kelly made a fist and they counted off. Kelly threw scissors, and Nick chuckled. He\u2019d thrown rock. He knocked his fist against Kelly\u2019s fingers. \u201cBoom.\u201d</p><p>Kelly grunted as he rolled out of bed. \u201cFucker.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 6</p><p>\"o,\u201d Hagan drawled with a knowing look at Nick \u201cSas soon as he appeared for breakfast. His hair was mussed and he was still wearing his T-shirt and jeans from last night.</p><p>Nick glanced at him, shaking his head as he tended to breakfast. He knew Hagan would give him hell.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your boy?\u201d Hagan asked. He slid into the banquette on the other side of the kitchen counter so he could watch Nick cook.</p><p>\u201cStill in bed.\u201d Nick glanced at him, glaring briefly. \u201cOkay, go on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t hear a thing,\u201d Hagan claimed, and he reached for the plate of food that was ready. \u201cHow long have you been up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot long. I got a search going for robberies where papers or historical documents were taken. It\u2019s worldwide, though, so might be a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSolid. What are we going to do with your hit man?\u201d</p><p>Nick shrugged, glancing at the stairs. \u201cHelp him, I guess.</p><p>That\u2019s what I promised him I\u2019d do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ever make a promise and then think, ehhhh?\u201d</p><p>Nick snickered, flipped a pancake in the air, and then dropped it back in the pan.</p><p>\u201cGot any coffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t drink coffee. I\u2019ve got tea.\u201d</p><p>Hagan shrugged, wrinkling his nose. \u201cThis city was founded on the concept of tossing tea into the harbor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is . . . no. It was not.\u201d</p><p>There was a thump from below. A few moments later Kelly popped his head over the railing and sniffed the air like a dog. \u201cIs that bacon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd eggs, and pancakes. Come on,\u201d Nick said to him. He looked back to Hagan. \u201cAppointment with the shrink at nine.</p><p>Can you handle it, or should we get a few uniforms on it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got it covered,\u201d Hagan said as he tried to swallow a mouthful of eggs. \u201cDamn, kid, this is good. I didn\u2019t know you could cook.\u201d</p><p>Kelly slipped behind Nick and grabbed a plate. He kept his hand on the small of Nick\u2019s back, ostensibly so Nick wouldn\u2019t back into him in the small galley. When he moved again, though, his hand stayed there. He gave Nick a sideways grin before dragging his fingers across Nick\u2019s hip and moving away.</p><p>Nick shivered violently. He was so intent on Kelly that he burned himself on the stove when he reached for the pan.</p><p>He was still cursing and sucking on the end of his finger as he scrambled for his aloe plant when JD and Julian both joined them.</p><p>\u201cSmooth, Detective,\u201d Julian commented. His voice was just as droll as Nick remembered it being from their first meeting.</p><p>Nick broke off a tip of one of the aloe leaves and rubbed it over his finger, casting a glare in Julian\u2019s direction. \u201cI had an idea last night,\u201d Nick told him.</p><p>\u201cReally? I can\u2019t imagine where you got the time,\u201d Julian drawled.</p><p>Nick narrowed his eyes, but he wasn\u2019t the type to be embarrassed about much of anything. \u201cIf that star is in Boston, I know someone who might be able to help us find it.\u201d</p><p>Julian perked up at that. He glanced at the others, who were all watching Nick with wide eyes. \u201cAnd who might that be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s stolen goods. Even in 1908, there were only so many people you could go to with stolen goods and keep it quiet for this long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a very bad idea,\u201d Hagan blurted.</p><p>Nick shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m open to better ones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, who are you talking about?\u201d JD asked.</p><p>Kelly cleared his throat, rubbing his hand across the bridge of his nose. He had his eyes closed. \u201cThe Irish mob,\u201d he guessed. \u201cHe\u2019s talking about asking the Irish mob.\u201d</p><p>JD\u2019s mouth parted as he stared at Kelly, then looked to Nick with wide eyes. \u201cThat does sound like a bad idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going in there without backup,\u201d Hagan declared. \u201cNot happening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got backup,\u201d Nick said with a jerk of his head toward Julian and Kelly.</p><p>Hagan rubbed his palm over his mouth, resting his elbow on the counter. It hit his fork and sent the utensil flying, but he didn\u2019t even try to catch it. \u201cPartner to partner, how safe can you be doing this?\u201d</p><p>Nick shrugged and grinned crookedly. \u201cJust as safe as we were at lunch yesterday.\u201d</p><p>Kelly couldn\u2019t seem to stop pacing while Nick was on the phone. He\u2019d told them he was making a cal , then stepped out onto the deck and closed the door behind him. They couldn\u2019t hear what he was saying, didn\u2019t know who he was talking to, and Kelly couldn\u2019t even see him to try to read his lips.</p><p>Kelly knew enough about Nick\u2019s past to know this was a hugely stupid risk for him to take. Any interaction he had with the Irish mob here in Boston made him wide-open after the history he had with them.</p><p>They\u2019d been drinking one night in Jacksonville while stationed at Camp Lejeune, playing pool and throwing darts, blowing off steam, when Nick had let slip why he\u2019d joined the Marines. \u201cIt was that or keep running jobs for the Irish mob,\u201d he\u2019d said with a signature O\u2019Flaherty grin before he\u2019d downed his beer and then gone to hustle a sailor in a game of pool.</p><p>Kelly had always felt there was more to the story, though.</p><p>Hagan had put up a few more weak arguments before he\u2019d taken JD to the psychologist for his interview. None of them could give Nick a viable alternative, though. Without the map that was said to be hidden on the star brooch, there was no way to find the treasure for Julian. And without any idea of the whereabouts of the robbers, JD was still in danger as well, and so was Cameron.</p><p>Nick stepped back into the salon, looking grim.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Kelly demanded.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got a meet tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was fast,\u201d Julian said. \u201cJesus, what sort of in do you have with them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA personal one,\u201d Nick growled. His tone made it clear that neither Julian nor Kelly were supposed to inquire further.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the meet?\u201d Kelly asked instead.</p><p>\u201cLiberty Hotel, six tonight. We\u2019re supposed to book two rooms, and reserve a spot for dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiberty Hotel. Isn\u2019t that the place you wanted to take me? The old jail they turned into a hotel?\u201d</p><p>Nick nodded. \u201cLooks like we\u2019ll get to see it after al .\u201d He walked past Julian and Kelly, heading belowdecks without another word.</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d Kelly said.</p><p>Julian took a step closer, lowering his voice. \u201cIs there a missing piece of information I need to know here?\u201d</p><p>Kelly sucked in a deep breath and hesitated, eyes darting between Julian and the stairwell.</p><p>\u201cI understand your loyalty to him, but I\u2019m not used to working blind,\u201d Julian said, voice gentle and persuasive.</p><p>\u201cNick grew up here,\u201d Kelly said quietly. \u201cDuring the time when teenagers either got out, or got initiated. You understand?\u201d</p><p>Julian nodded curtly.</p><p>\u201cNick chose the Marines at seventeen to avoid the mob.</p><p>That\u2019s all I know.\u201d</p><p>Julian nodded again, then smiled sadly. \u201cRather like choosing the RAF to avoid the IRA.\u201d The phone in the pocket of his jeans began to vibrate, and he scrambled to grab for it.</p><p>\u201cThis is Cross.\u201d</p><p>Kelly was close enough to hear the murmur of the voice on the phone, but he couldn\u2019t make out what it was saying.</p><p>\u201cI want to speak to him,\u201d Cross demanded. \u201cI want to know he\u2019s alive before I give you anything.\u201d</p><p>Kelly mouthed the word, \u201cKidnappers?\u201d</p><p>Julian nodded.</p><p>Kelly darted for the stairs, sliding down the railing with his hands and feet like he\u2019d been taught twenty years ago when he\u2019d joined the Navy. \u201cNick!\u201d he hissed.</p><p>Nick poked his head out of the bathroom. Half his face was covered in shaving cream, and he was wearing no shirt, just his jeans and a towel resting on his shoulder. He held his razor in his hand like a weapon.</p><p>\u201cKidnappers on Julian\u2019s phone.\u201d</p><p>Nick tossed his razor over his shoulder and hustled after Kelly up the steps. He went to the banquette in the pilothouse and ripped one of the cushions off, then rummaged inside the bench. Kelly hadn\u2019t even known those benches were hollow.</p><p>Nick came out with a contraption that looked like one of the original mobile phones that had come in bags.</p><p>He dropped it on the table and opened it up. Inside was an array of listening and GPS devices. Nick gestured for Julian to come closer, and as Julian spoke on the phone to his kidnapped boyfriend, Nick plugged the device into his phone. They had to contort to do it, and Julian wound up with shaving cream all over his shoulder.</p><p>He gave Nick one of the dirtiest looks Kelly had ever seen a man make, but Nick merely shrugged and turned the tracking device on. He rolled his finger through the air, telling Julian to stall and draw out the conversation. Then he handed him his towel almost sheepishly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Julian wiped at his shoulder, still glowering.</p><p>Nick pulled Kelly to the side, dropping his voice to an almost inaudible whisper. \u201cWhat did they want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe just demanded to talk to his boyfriend before he\u2019d give them information.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey want an update on his progress. Means they\u2019re getting nervous. Fuck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re going to kill this kid if he doesn\u2019t find that treasure,\u201d Kelly said.</p><p>Nick was watching Julian over Kelly\u2019s shoulder. His jaw jumped as he gritted his teeth. \u201cGod help them if they do.\u201d</p><p>Kelly glanced behind him. Julian\u2019s eyes were hard as obsidian and his shoulders were rigid. He was obviously back on the phone with the kidnappers. Kelly took Nick\u2019s elbow and pulled him toward the salon, then they stepped out on the deck and pulled the door closed.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to be able to handle this meeting tonight? Because he\u2019s compromised as hell and I haven\u2019t been in a firefight in over a year.\u201d</p> <p>Nick slid his hand up Kelly\u2019s arm, his expression softening.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d take a rusty you over anyone to have my back.\u201d</p><p>Kelly tried not to smile, but he couldn\u2019t help himself. He swiped his finger through the drying shaving cream on Nick\u2019s cheek. \u201cYou should have left it scruffy. I like it like that.\u201d</p><p>Nick smirked and then pursed his lips as he nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll remember that. But tonight, we have to dress to the nines.</p><p>Did you bring a suit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve got one. Why?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause the man we\u2019re going to see won\u2019t speak to scruffy cops in jeans and leather jackets.\u201d</p><p>A flutter of nerves went through Kelly\u2019s stomach, though he wasn\u2019t sure why. They\u2019d faced dangerous men before.</p><p>Something about the tension in Nick was bleeding into him.</p><p>\u201cBut hey,\u201d Nick said, putting on that bright-side mask he\u2019d always worn in the Corps. He smiled, and somehow he forced the warmth to reach his eyes. Kelly\u2019d always wondered how in the hell Nick did that. \u201cAt least we\u2019ll get that romantic night we were planning, right?\u201d</p><p>Kelly snorted. \u201cWhackadoo.\u201d</p><p>The door from the salon opened and Julian stepped out, still fussing with the shaving cream on his shirt.</p><p>\u201cFor Christ\u2019s sake, it\u2019s a cotton T-shirt!\u201d Nick said. \u201cI\u2019ll let you borrow one of mine!\u201d</p><p>Julian huffed at him.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019d they say?\u201d Kelly asked.</p><p>\u201cCameron is still safe. He swore he was unharmed, and I tend to believe him, though it was obvious someone was closely monitoring his words. He chose them with great care.</p><p>They wanted to know where I was, and what progress I had made. I told them I\u2019d been forced to enlist assistance. I got the distinct feeling they already knew that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think they\u2019re following you?\u201d Nick asked.</p><p>\u201cIf they were, I\u2019d know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re keeping tabs somehow,\u201d Nick insisted.</p><p>\u201cMaybe they heard about the robbery,\u201d Kelly suggested.</p><p>\u201cKnew it was either Julian or the other crew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d Julian whispered.</p><p>\u201cWhat role did you play in that?\u201d Nick asked him.</p><p>\u201cIn what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe robbery. The murders,\u201d Nick said, his voice hard.</p><p>\u201cWas any of that you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Detective. I was merely tailing them. And doing so from quite a distance. I never saw them, other than the van they drove. I got there and the scene was already as you found it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were tailing them?\u201d Nick shouted. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say that before? Where\u2019d they come from? Are they based somewhere in Boston?\u201d</p><p>Julian remained irritatingly calm in the face of Nick\u2019s outburst. Kelly was impressed.</p><p>\u201cThey came from the airport. I followed their trail. I\u2019m not concealing information from you, Detective. I want them stopped as badly as you do. More so than you, I would wager.\u201d</p><p>Nick pointed his finger at Julian, wagging it threateningly. He calmed quickly though, acknowledging the logic in Julian\u2019s explanation. \u201cI\u2019m going to go finish shaving,\u201d he said through his teeth as he left them.</p><p>Julian watched him go, then turned back to Kelly with a sigh. \u201cHe seems tense.\u201d</p><p>Kelly nodded.</p><p>\u201cHe struck me as the sane one when I met him before.</p><p>Relaxed. Well-adjusted. He\u2019s not anymore.\u201d</p><p>Kelly pressed his lips into a thin line, nodding in agreement. \u201cYou said you were in the military?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBriefly, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe team was called back last year. Whatever work they had them doing, it fucked them all up a little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Julian asked. His concern seemed genuine.</p><p>Kelly\u2019s stomach roiled and he looked away, into the yacht to see if Nick was anywhere near. \u201cHe won\u2019t say.\u201d</p><p>Kelly excused himself before Julian could ask more questions. He almost barreled into Nick as he came back out onto the deck.</p><p>Nick had already finished getting dressed. He\u2019d forgone the suit today, instead staying in the jeans he\u2019d been wearing and putting on a plain black T-shirt. His favorite leather jacket was over his arm, and his badge was on a chain around his neck. He was also wearing a shoulder holster with a gun on each side, rather than the one he usually kept on his hip.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Kelly asked.</p><p>\u201cGoing to work.\u201d He held up his phone. \u201cThe trace didn\u2019t get their location, call wasn\u2019t long enough.\u201d</p><p>Julian sighed shakily and nodded.</p><p>\u201cIt did give us a region, though,\u201d Nick added.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Julian blurted. \u201cWhere are they holding him?\u201d</p><p>Nick\u2019s expression hardened, and he met Julian\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re in Boston.\u201d</p><p>It took a few moments for Julian to get his temper and nerves under control; Kelly could actually see the emotions playing across his face. \u201cI suppose that makes sense. They knew Boston was going to be in play in the end.\u201d He stood there a moment, and Nick and Kelly were both silent, letting him work through it. \u201cExcuse me,\u201d he finally whispered, and he stepped past them into the salon.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s handling that well,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cIf they had you tied up somewhere and I found out you were in the same city, I\u2019d be ripping things apart.\u201d</p><p>Nick hummed and nodded as he watched Julian disappear down the steps.</p><p>Kelly studied his profile a moment before jabbing him with an elbow. \u201cHey. What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething . . .\u201d Nick shook his head and met Kelly\u2019s eyes again with a weak smile. He slid his phone into his back pocket, then pulled Kelly closer to kiss him. \u201cStick with Cross, will you? See if you two can make some headway with this treasure shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the history buff, babe, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d know where to start.\u201d</p><p>Nick nodded as if he understood that he was basically asking Kelly to sit on his hands all day. He looked annoyed with himself. \u201cSee what you can come up with anyway. Please? Don\u2019t let Cross out of your sight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t trust him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got it.\u201d</p><p>Nick gave him another kiss, lingering over this one, then headed off for the dock and the parking lot beyond. Julian joined Kelly soon after, wearing a shirt he\u2019d pilfered from Nick\u2019s closet. Kelly and Julian stood together on the deck, watching Nick walk off.</p><p>\u201cCare to take an unsupervised field trip?\u201d Julian asked after a few moments.</p><p>\u201cIf I say no, are you going to ditch me the first time I take a piss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Kelly nodded dejectedly. \u201cLet me put some shoes on.\u201d</p><p>Nick left his Range Rover for Kelly and Julian, knowing that as soon as he was out of sight, both men would be off. He trusted Kelly to take care of himself, though; he didn\u2019t need his hand held. And hell, maybe they\u2019d drum something up.</p><p>He left a note on his windshield for Kelly, then went to the storage unit where he kept his motorcycle. He liked to ride the bike when he was running down leads anyway. It was easier to find parking, even with the police plates.</p><p>He headed for the station first, checking in on the requests they\u2019d put in for JD\u2019s identity. A report had come in on the other robberies they\u2019d searched for. Nick sat to read over it, then noticed a message on his desk from Boston College. One of the professors had responded to their inquiries, saying he recognized JD.</p><p>Nick tossed the robbery files aside and reached for his phone instead. When he called the number that had been left, a woman answered.</p><p>\u201cThis is Detective Nicholas O\u2019Flaherty, I\u2019m looking for a Professor Kris Singleton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is Kris,\u201d the woman said. Nick had been expecting a man, but he shrugged it off. He liked her voice; it was smooth and a little hoarse.</p><p>\u201cProfessor, do you have a moment to speak to me in regard to the photos my officers were circulating yesterday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh! Yes, of course, Detective. What can I tell you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou recognized the man in the photo?\u201d Nick asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he a professor at Boston College? An employee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no no. He\u2019s a writer.\u201d</p><p>Nick frowned and scrambled for his notepad. \u201cA writer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI teach one of his books for a course. I recognized him from the photo on the back jacket. My students ask me every year if I can convince him to come and guest lecture.\u201d</p><p>Nick smiled. He could see why college kids would want to sit and stare at JD for an hour. \u201cOkay. What course is it you teach? Literature of some sort?\u201d</p><p>\u201cArchaeology and anthropology. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ve misspoken, Detective; I recognized him from a book he wrote, but writing is not his profession. See, I teach a course on pop culture, and we discuss the differences between reality and fiction in the field of archaeology.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExpectation of the job versus the realities?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, telling them they\u2019re not Indiana Jones,\u201d Nick said.</p><p>\u201cExactly. But I try not to skew the course, so I offer readings from archaeologists and other scientists who . . . quite frankly are more like adventurers. Hiram Bingham III, Roy Chapman Andrews, Lonnie Thompson and Ellen Mosley-Thompson, and Mark Moffett, to name a few.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Scientists who are also kind of badasses, I follow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m impressed, Detective, that you would know those names. They\u2019re rather obscure bits of history.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew the first two,\u201d Nick admitted.</p><p>She laughed. \u201cFair enough. He\u2019s arguably one of those. His books are full of . . . treasure hunts and gunfights. Entertaining reading, but not the way it\u2019s done. Not really.\u201d</p><p>Nick\u2019s stomach turned with this new piece of information.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s his name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHunt. Casey Hunt.\u201d</p><p>Kelly could see the parking lot from the flybridge, so he knew Nick had left the Range Rover. After going through all the drawers in the house, though, he couldn\u2019t find a spare set of keys.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll either call a cab or hot-wire it,\u201d Julian finally told him when he reached the end of his patience. He swept out of the yacht and onto the dock without giving Kelly a chance to argue. Kelly had to jog to catch up with him.</p><p>\u201cYou know, you lose something without the long black coat. Little air of mystery is gone,\u201d Kelly told him as they headed for the parking lot. Julian gave his khakis and borrowed T-shirt an offended grunt. Kelly shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>Kelly\u2019s steps slowed when they came to the car and he saw a white note beneath the windshield wiper, fluttering in the breeze. He plucked it off and unfolded it.</p><p>Keys are in the wheel well. Please don\u2019t hot-wire her. O.</p><p>Julian read it over Kelly\u2019s shoulder. \u201cHe knows you well,\u201d he commented before making his way to the passenger door.</p><p>Kelly grinned and knelt to search for the keys. Of course Nick knew him well. That was part of the attraction. \u201cWhere are we headed?\u201d he asked as soon as he had the Range Rover running.</p><p>\u201cThe bookstore.\u201d Julian held up Nick\u2019s badge, the one he clipped on his belt when he wore a suit. \u201cI want to look around.\u201d</p><p>Kelly whistled and shook his head, putting the car in drive. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be in so much trouble,\u201d he sang.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be fine. He won\u2019t know if you don\u2019t tell him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFat chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just need to get the accent down.\u201d</p><p>Kelly spent most of the drive critiquing Julian\u2019s imitation of Nick\u2019s accent. He\u2019d heard some Boston accents that were damn near unrecognizable. Others, like Nick\u2019s, were softer or had faded due to being away from home for so long. Nick\u2019s grew heavier when he was drunk or ranting about something, usually baseball but also anything that required the word \u201cfuckers\u201d said with it.</p><p>Sometimes Kelly tried to rile him just to hear the original accent, but Nick was usually unflappable. He had to resort to saying \u201cGo Yankees\u201d to really get Nick worked up.</p><p>\u201cYou might get by with that one,\u201d Kelly advised after Julian\u2019s last attempt. \u201cJust . . . don\u2019t say much. And don\u2019t use Nick\u2019s name; they all know him around here, and you definitely don\u2019t pass as a six-foot-one redhead.\u201d</p><p>When they reached the bookstore, Kelly parked on the street, trusting the police plates on Nick\u2019s vehicle to keep him from getting towed. Glass still littered the sidewalk, although it had mostly been swept into a pile. The shattered windows were boarded with plywood. Police tape sealed off the door, with a red tag attached near the doorknob that warned whoever entered about chain of custody. They were supposed to sign the little tag. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCan you do his signature?\u201d Julian asked. \u201cThere\u2019s no one here to see it isn\u2019t him.\u201d</p><p>Kelly grudgingly signed Nick\u2019s name on the red slip.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re taking all the blame for this,\u201d he told Julian. \u201cAnd I\u2019m telling him you stole that badge.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUnderstood.\u201d Julian pulled a knife from somewhere inside his jacket and slit the tape along the edge. When he tried the door, though, it was locked. He pulled a lockpick set out of another pocket, and knelt to work on it.</p><p>\u201cHow many pockets do you have in that thing?\u201d Kelly asked.</p><p>Julian chuckled grimly. \u201cYou have no idea.\u201d The door popped open, and Julian replaced his tools and stepped inside.</p><p>It was dim and dusty, and the smell of old paper and leather was overwhelming. Kelly headed to the car and rummaged through the back for a flashlight. He found a heavy Maglite, along with other supplies that might come in handy in the next few days if this led to a treasure hunt like he expected. He rejoined Julian, and clicked the flashlight on.</p><p>It played over the mess that was left of the shop. \u201cJesus.</p> <p>Why\u2019d they tear it apart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suspect they didn\u2019t actually find what they were looking for and this was either anger or desperation. Perhaps even a brawl. At this point, with little to no success, the rats may be turning on each other.\u201d Julian made his way carefully to the display case that seemed to have taken the brunt of the attack.</p><p>\u201cHow many of them are there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo to five. I\u2019m not sure of their exact number,\u201d Julian answered, but he was distracted by the case. \u201cBring that torch here.\u201d\u201cTorch,\u201d Kelly echoed. \u201cOh, I miss the English.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not English, I\u2019m Irish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame thing,\u201d Kelly teased. He stepped over a pile of scattered books and shone the light on the display case.</p> <p>Julian placed his palm over what looked like a handprint in the dust. Then he swept his hand through the air, curling his fingers into a fist as he did so, hovering over another hinted outline of a print. The action seemed to mimic perfectly what someone had done to the display case.</p><p>\u201cThey wiped it down?\u201d Kelly asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure. It could be a grab for whatever sat here. This case is extremely old, look.\u201d Julian tapped his fingers on the corner. \u201cDark walnut with cabriole legs and dovetail joints. I believe this itself is a Colonial era piece.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that important?\u201d</p><p>Julian fingered the wood like he was looking for something, but he shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m not sure. It\u2019s possible it was part of a collection of items, all from the same era. I don\u2019t know.\u201d He straightened with a sigh and glanced around the shop. \u201cWhoever destroyed the rest of this store, though, left this case intact. I wager they knew it was antique and couldn\u2019t bring themselves to touch it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMurderers with a respect for history. Huh. I wonder what led them here,\u201d Kelly said as he began to explore the narrow, dusty aisles. \u201cHow far ahead of you were they in all this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo far. Much too far.\u201d</p><p>Nick sat at his desk, hunched over files and notes and several books he\u2019d had one of the summer interns go find for him at a nearby bookstore. He didn\u2019t realize he was no longer alone until someone tapped him on the shoulder.</p> <p>\u201cYou chasing down a lead?\u201d Hagan asked him.</p><p>\u201cUh . . .\u201d Nick\u2019s eyes darted to JD, who was beside Hagan, craning his head to see the books on Nick\u2019s desk. \u201cYeah. Yeah, I am.\u201d</p><p>Hagan threw himself into his chair and clunked his boots on the desk. \u201cWhat you got?\u201d</p><p>Nick glanced at JD again and gestured for him to sit.</p><p>After a few seconds of trying to decide how best to word it, he simply said, \u201cWe found out who you are.\u201d</p><p>JD\u2019s eyes widened and he sat forward, a smile playing across his lips. \u201cYou\u2019re serious?\u201d</p><p>Nick nodded.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t look happy,\u201d JD said, dread creeping into his voice. \u201cOh God, I\u2019m someone horrible, aren\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>Nick picked up one of the books he\u2019d sent for. \u201cYou actually seem like a pretty interesting character,\u201d he said, and he set it down in front of JD.</p><p>JD eyed the book, then Nick from beneath lowered brows. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>Nick picked it up again and turned it over. On the back cover was a photo of JD wearing aviators and a canvas military-style jacket, standing on a mountain with Machu Picchu in the background.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s me!\u201d JD he grabbed the book, pointing at the photo and then turning it over to see the title. \u201cI\u2019m an archaeologist?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe professor I spoke with probably wouldn\u2019t agree. She basically said you\u2019re a hack.\u201d</p><p>JD burst out laughing, then covered his mouth and nodded. \u201cI can deal with being a hack. Oh my God.\u201d</p><p>Nick raised his head in time to catch sight of Kelly and Julian entering the squad room. He raised his hand and waved them over when the desk sergeant tried to stop them.</p><p>\u201cCasey Hunt.\u201d JD set the book down gently, his fingers resting on the cover. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t sound familiar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Kelly asked as they approached.</p><p>\u201cWe got an ID on him,\u201d Nick answered.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Nick could see the hesitation in Kelly\u2019s eyes. He obviously knew the chances of JD being a good guy were slim.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good, right?\u201d</p><p>Nick didn\u2019t answer. He knocked his knuckles against the desk instead.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m apparently . . . a lot braver than I feel,\u201d JD commented as he paged through the book. He looked a little crestfallen, even though they\u2019d just had a major breakthrough.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Nick asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I was just hoping learning my name would . . .</p><p>throw a latch or something, you know? Make me remember.</p><p>It doesn\u2019t even feel right, though. Hell, JD feels more like my name than Casey.\u201d</p><p>Kelly sat on the edge of the desk, glancing at Nick again.</p><p>\u201cIt takes three days to develop a new habit. We\u2019ve been cal ing you JD for three days, so . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I guess,\u201d JD murmured. \u201cCan you keep cal ing me that? Just for a while, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you want,\u201d Nick said quietly. He pointed at Julian and Kelly. \u201cCan I see you two for a minute?\u201d</p><p>They followed along without question, heading for one of the interrogation rooms. Julian glanced around the box uneasily as soon as the door closed behind them.</p><p>\u201cEver been in one of these?\u201d Nick asked him in amusement.</p><p>He leaned against the wall and crossed his arms out of habit.</p><p>It was always his first position when questioning a suspect.</p><p>Julian rolled his eyes, but he refused to sit at the table.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you two doing here?\u201d Nick asked them.</p><p>\u201cWe found something,\u201d Julian answered.</p><p>Nick\u2019s eyebrows rose. \u201cAt the bookstore?\u201d</p><p>Kelly had been kicking at the legs of the table, which were bolted down, but he pulled up short. \u201cHow\u2019d you know we went to the bookstore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the only lead you had, and neither of you strikes me as the type who\u2019d look shit up on the internet or in a book. Did you get anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d Julian admitted. \u201cLooking over the scene, though, I felt as if they missed something. They went for the case first, where they thought it would be, then they ransacked the place when it wasn\u2019t there.\u201d</p><p>Nick nodded. \u201cCrime scene analysts came back with a blow-by-blow. They said the shopkeeper surprised one man coming out of the store. Guy opened fire, killing the owner.</p><p>And judging by the trajectory, he\u2019s the one who clipped JD.</p><p>Meaning JD was walking away from the bookstore, toward the street. The others were in the street, likely by their van waiting. They opened fire on their own guy after he shot the owner, blew him away, took out the windows, left everyone for dead. Left the books the guy took. As soon as there was bloodshed, they bailed. Complete mission failure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is the first murder to take place,\u201d Julian pointed out.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps they killed him to take the heat for it. Or perhaps he turned on them.\u201d</p><p>Nick shrugged.</p><p>\u201cWait a minute, if the first shots clipped JD, that means he was standing between the store and the van,\u201d Kelly pointed out. \u201cWhat was he doing there? Why would they let him get that close instead of diverting him? And why do you look so pissy when you just broke his identity, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>Nick sighed heavily. \u201cHe\u2019s a professional treasure hunter.</p><p>He has a degree from Columbia University, works out of a museum in New York. He\u2019s got a reputation for going into dangerous areas and getting out unscathed with local shiny things. He\u2019s also been accused of selling items on the black market, but there\u2019s no proof.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Kelly said, and his shoulders slumped.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re right. They wouldn\u2019t have let him get between them and the store,\u201d Nick continued. \u201cNot unless he was one of theirs to begin with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a shame,\u201d Julian said. \u201cI was beginning to like him.</p><p>His sketch of Cameron notwithstanding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I want to know,\u201d Nick said heatedly, \u201cis if there was only one man inside, and his shit was still in his bag when they left him there, who the fuck has those missing artifacts now?\u201d</p><p>Kelly and Julian both fell silent, frowning at Nick. Nick had been asking himself that all morning. The thieves hadn\u2019t gotten away with anything, the evidence suggested as much.</p><p>But there were still two things missing. So where the hell were they? And why hadn\u2019t they been where they were supposed to be?</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Julian finally said, taking a deep breath. \u201cI suppose you should go ask your amnesiac that question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d JD asked Nick as soon as he saw him.</p><p>Kelly was right on Nick\u2019s heels, trying to calm him, trying to keep him from blowing up. That had always been his job, and he was good at it on the rare occasions when he had to do it. Nick rarely even came close to losing his temper, but when it happened it was seriously impressive. And scary, for anyone who didn\u2019t know him. Kelly got in front of him and put both hands on his chest.</p><p>\u201cBreathe and think, O,\u201d he ordered.</p><p>Nick lowered his head, and his eyes glinted when he met Kelly\u2019s. \u201cI\u2019m calm. Let me do my job.\u201d</p><p>Kelly knew when he\u2019d been beat; he stepped aside and held his hands up. Nick grabbed his jacket off the back of his chair, pul ing it up on two wheels and then toppling it over as the leather dragged it down. It clattered to the ground, and both Hagan and JD stood in alarm.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Hagan demanded.</p><p>\u201cOrder up an unmarked, we\u2019re going for a ride,\u201d Nick said.</p><p>He took JD by the elbow and led him toward the door.</p><p>Kelly hurried to right the chair Nick had left in his wake, then shrugged in response to Hagan\u2019s questioning look and jogged after his lover. He caught up to them in the stairwell.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on, what happened?\u201d JD kept asking.</p><p>\u201cNew evidence,\u201d Nick snarled. \u201cNeed you to walk us through something.\u201d</p><p>JD\u2019s eyes were still wide and confused, but he was smart enough to stay quiet. Even Kelly kept his mouth shut until they were in the parking lot.</p><p>\u201cNick,\u201d he finally demanded, and he grabbed at Nick\u2019s elbow. He turned him until they were facing each other, trying to make Nick look into his eyes and realize he was spiraling out of control. Kelly didn\u2019t want to divert the spiral, because he was of the opinion that JD needed to see what he was messing around with if he was faking. But he didn\u2019t want to be left behind, either. \u201cWhere are we going, and what do you want us to do?\u201d</p><p>Nick\u2019s eyes darted over Kelly\u2019s face, then to Julian, who was silently following along. \u201cYou two follow us in my car.\u201d</p><p>Kelly nodded and let him go.</p><p>Hagan held up the keys to the unmarked sedan he\u2019d requisitioned, and Kelly stood aside and watched Nick shove JD into the backseat and slam the door.</p><p>Julian clucked his tongue, then sauntered over to the Range Rover. But Kelly remained rooted to the spot for another few seconds. Nick hated being lied to, despised it with more passion than anything, even the New York Yankees.</p><p>God help JD if he was trying to play Nick with a lie. God help them al .</p><p>Once on the road, Kelly had a hard time keeping up with Hagan until Julian casually flicked on the flashing dashboard light. They shared a look, both of them trying not to grin and failing.</p><p>\u201cI could get used to this,\u201d Julian drawled.</p><p>\u201cHell yeah.\u201d</p><p>When they reached the bookstore again, Nick was already out of the car and standing in the middle of the street. They\u2019d parked their vehicle with its lights flashing across the narrow lane to block traffic, and Nick was waving to Kelly, telling him where to park the Range Rover.</p><p>Kelly angled it, glancing around uneasily. He kept having to remind himself that Nick was a real cop on a real case and everything he did was with the appropriate authority. Kelly hoped it was, at least.</p><p>He got out of the Range Rover, his hand going to the butt of the gun under his jacket out of habit. He rarely wore a weapon on his hip anymore, but he was getting used to the feeling of having it there again.</p><p>Nick strode toward them and pointed to a chalk marking on the ground. \u201cShooter right here,\u201d he said to Kelly. \u201cStand there. Bullet holes in the building put the shooter facing this way. Don\u2019t move.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAll righty,\u201d Kelly muttered.</p><p>Hagan and JD joined them as Nick was positioning Kelly.</p><p>\u201cGetting a little bossy, there, O,\u201d Hagan observed. \u201cIt\u2019s a damn miracle you ever get laid.\u201d</p> <p>Nick didn\u2019t respond to the attempt at banter. He beckoned JD with two fingers, walking midway into the street and pointing to another mark on the ground. \u201cStand here. Face the car.\u201d</p><p>JD nodded, standing where he\u2019d been told. He kept staring up at Nick with wide blue eyes, like a puppy being scolded. Kelly and Hagan shared a concerned glance.</p><p>\u201cThis is the staff sergeant coming out,\u201d Kelly told Hagan quietly. \u201cI\u2019m used to it.\u201d</p><p>Hagan looked him up and down, narrowing his eyes. \u201cYou come like a fire hose when he gives you an order, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if he tells me to,\u201d Kelly countered with a smirk.</p> <p>Hagan rolled his eyes. Nick called him from where he was standing on the sidewalk in front of the shop door, and Hagan strolled over to join him. They were far enough away that Kelly had to strain to hear what they were saying. Nick was telling Hagan he was the owner who\u2019d been gunned down walking into the store. Then Julian obliged Nick\u2019s request to stand in the doorway, where the thief had been shot dead and fallen across the threshold.</p><p>When they were all standing where the evidence indicated they should have been, Nick walked through the scene, studying them, a frown firmly on his face.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know where the van was?\u201d Kelly called to him.</p><p>\u201cWindow glass,\u201d Nick answered as he circled JD. \u201cHad JD\u2019s blood on it. Bullet clipped him, carried onto the van.\u201d</p><p>He stepped back, looking first at Kelly, then at Julian. Hagan stood to the side, out of the line of fire. But Julian and Kelly were directly across from one another, and JD formed a direct line of fire between the two.</p><p>Nick put his hands on his hips, prowling back and forth, chewing on his lip. \u201cFuck,\u201d he finally grunted.</p> <p>Julian raised his hand as if he were holding a gun, and Kelly did the same, firing an imaginary bullet at him.</p><p>\u201cNo way of knowing what was fired first,\u201d Hagan called.</p><p>\u201cBut if you ask me, this looks like an assassination. Whoever was standing where the Doc is, he took out his own man in cold blood.\u201d</p><p>Nick had a hand over his mouth, still circling JD, studying him, his feet, the way he was positioned versus the rest of them.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re making me really nervous right now,\u201d JD finally told him.</p><p>Nick stopped in front of him. He waited a beat, and behind them Julian raised his hand again as if aiming a weapon at them. \u201cTurn around,\u201d Nick ordered JD.</p><p>When JD did, he flinched at the sight of Julian aiming at him. He took a step back and knocked into Nick, who didn\u2019t give an inch of ground. He held on to JD instead, keeping him from panicking or bolting.</p><p>Kelly abandoned his position and jogged over to them.</p> <p>\u201cHey. That shit\u2019s uncalled for, man. Not cool,\u201d he shouted.</p><p>He moved to help free JD from Nick\u2019s grasp, but the stunned look of terror on JD\u2019s face stopped him. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember . . . running.\u201d JD took a shallow, shaky breath.</p><p>\u201cI was running away from the store. Away from him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom him?\u201d Nick asked, pointing at Julian.</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t me!\u201d Julian called in a bored voice.</p><p>\u201cNo, from the man who was shot. I ran out of the store.</p><p>I was in there.\u201d He put both hands to his head and closed his eyes. \u201cOh God. I really was in there.\u201d</p><p>When Nick finally met Kelly\u2019s eyes, he looked weary and almost sick. Kelly realized the hard-ass hissy fit he\u2019d just thrown had all been part of a show he was putting on for JD, hoping to jog something loose. It had worked. It had been brutal and perhaps a little immoral, but it had worked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Nick offered. He gave JD\u2019s shoulder a squeeze, then released him. \u201cLet\u2019s go inside. See if anything rings that bell again.\u201d</p><p>JD nodded and headed woodenly toward the store.</p><p>Kelly stepped in front of Nick, glaring at him briefly. \u201cYou either believe him or you don\u2019t,\u201d he whispered. \u201cIf you do, you can\u2019t pull shit like this. He\u2019s already been through enough trauma, and he trusts you. Only you. You got to live up to that, babe.\u201d</p><p>Nick nodded, his jaw jumping. \u201cIf he has to hate me to keep him safe, I can live with that.\u201d</p><p>Kelly was left standing there, mul ing that over as Nick sidestepped him and followed the others into the store. That was Nick\u2019s major vice, though, wasn\u2019t it? He\u2019d rather have someone hate him than get hurt.</p><p>Two of Nick\u2019s four sisters resented him and his distant relationship with his parents because they had no idea he\u2019d been the only thing standing between them and a childhood of being knocked around by their father. And to Kelly\u2019s everlasting annoyance, Nick refused to set them straight. He would rather they hate him and continue in their safe little bubble than learn the truth.</p><p>It took Kelly a while to get his temper in check before he could join the others in the shop. They were gathered around the display cabinet, scrutinizing it as if it might somehow provide them with doughnuts.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you, if this is authentic, it has a panel,\u201d JD was saying.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Kelly asked. Glass crunched beneath his feet as he approached them.</p><p>\u201cI was right about this cabinet,\u201d Julian answered. \u201cIt\u2019s Colonial era.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPieces from this era, of this style, often had hidden drawers or panels, places where papers could be hidden from the authorities,\u201d JD told them.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Kelly asked.</p><p>\u201cThe Stamp Act, maybe? Every piece of paper the colonists touched had to be affixed with a stamp. It was very costly.\u201d</p><p>Nick snorted derisively. \u201cThey didn\u2019t hide their papers because of the Stamp Act. They hid them because they were planning a rebellion. The Stamp Act was one of the Intolerable Acts; it was a series of bullshit handed down from the crown, created a rift that made the atmosphere one of secrecy and paranoia. That professor was right, you are a hack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d JD griped. \u201cYou watch too much History Channel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, the Stamp Act? What the fuck are we talking about?\u201d Kelly demanded.</p><p>Hagan gave the bottom of the case a nudge with his boot.</p><p>\u201cThe hack believes something could be hidden in the display case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe just need to . . . find it,\u201d JD said, and he reached his fingers out to touch.</p><p>Nick grabbed his wrist, making a hissing sound. \u201cActive crime scene,\u201d he grunted, and he extracted a pair of latex gloves from his pocket.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d JD said as he tugged them on. He ran his fingers gingerly over the wood. \u201cIt\u2019s in remarkably good condition.</p><p>I\u2019m not seeing any obvious spots.\u201d</p><p>Julian sighed heavily and shoved his hip against the case, rattling it down to its legs.</p><p>\u201cWatch it!\u201d JD shouted, and Nick and Hagan both jerked like they were going for their guns.</p><p>The decorative panel on the far right of the case rattled loose and fell. Julian caught it deftly, as if he\u2019d just pulled it from thin air. He was smirking when he glanced up at them.</p><p>\u201cI sell antiques,\u201d he quipped.</p><p>JD and Nick both glared at him, but Kelly moved forward and peered into the hidden compartment.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s in there?\u201d Nick demanded.</p><p>Kelly raised one eyebrow. \u201cGuess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are they doing in there?\u201d Hagan asked. \u201cHow\u2019d they get there? Unless the owner knew he was going to be robbed, what the fuck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI put them there,\u201d JD said, realization dawning. He nodded excitedly and placed his hand on the case, where the outline remained in the dust. He swept across it as if grabbing up the two items, and his motion followed the dust trail perfectly. \u201cThat\u2019s the only thing that makes sense.</p><p>I was subverting them. That\u2019s why I ran. Has to be.\u201d He glanced around at them all, the hope renewed in his eyes and his half smile.</p><p>\u201cIt gels,\u201d Hagan said to Nick. \u201cHe comes in under duress, they tell him to find this shit, but he\u2019s able to hide it and claim it\u2019s not here. Other guy starts tearing shit up, JD bolts like any sane man would, dead guy comes running out of the place shooting at JD. Then the killing starts.\u201d</p><p>Nick was nodding, his eyes unfocused. Then an idea must have hit him; the color drained from his face. \u201cThat\u2019s why they came after you again, at the pub,\u201d he said to JD. \u201cThey didn\u2019t know you hid this stuff because you went down in the street and they had to get out before they could check either body. They thought you still had it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy kill him, though?\u201d Kelly asked. \u201cWhy not try to grab him and get the items back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I don\u2019t get there first,\u201d JD said, his eyes on Nick. Nick nodded grimly, eyes darting between JD and Kelly.</p><p>\u201cWe have to get there first,\u201d Julian said.</p><p>Kelly straightened, shaking his shoulders out and clapping his hands together to rattle everyone from the suddenly heavy silence. \u201cWell, let\u2019s get on it! We\u2019ve got until our meeting tonight to look over these letters and figure this shit out, so let\u2019s work it out, bitches.\u201d</p><p>Nick chuckled, but held his finger up before Kelly could reach for the papers inside the case. \u201cCrime scene.\u201d</p><p>Kelly\u2019s shoulders slumped and he rolled his eyes. Nick got out his phone to call the techs in. \u201cUse your badge to have sex in a parked car but won\u2019t let me National Treasure a piece of evidence,\u201d Kelly muttered as he walked away.</p><p>\u201cParked car?\u201d Julian asked as he followed Kelly out.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s more fun when he\u2019s off duty.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 7</p><p>Elly\u2019s plan to spend the rest of the day going over Kthe bundle of letters they\u2019d found in the display case backfired spectacularly, because Nick apparently had shit to do that didn\u2019t involve trying to decipher Colonial-era penmanship and he refused to help.</p><p>He also refused to let Kelly do it, so Kelly was left with nothing to do but watch Nick fill out paperwork. He was so bored he could have cried.</p><p>Nick assigned the letters to Julian and Hagan instead, along with the contemporary diary that had been recovered at the scene. Nick and Kelly were sitting at Nick\u2019s desk as Nick finished the report on their visit to the crime scene, and Kelly was still glaring at his lover.</p><p>Nick finally looked up, blinking at Kelly when he met his eyes.</p><p>Nick put his pen down and glanced around the squad room. He gestured for Kelly to come with him, and he stood, heading for the stairwell. Once in private, Nick trailed his fingers down Kelly\u2019s cheek with a soft smile. \u201cYou\u2019re pissed at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIrritated, yes.\u201d</p><p>Nick\u2019s smile was gentle, almost amused. \u201cWhat\u2019d I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being a little more cavalier than I\u2019m used to seeing you, it\u2019s throwing me off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Nick offered. He sounded sincere. \u201cThe letters are important, you\u2019re right. But I want Cross off the streets, you with me? If he\u2019s combing through letters, he\u2019s not shooting up my city looking for Cameron.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, makes sense,\u201d Kelly grudgingly acknowledged.</p><p>\u201cWhat about me, though? Why am I sitting and watching you do paperwork?\u201d</p><p>Nick narrowed his eyes. \u201cOne, because it was you and not me who cut the tape at the scene and I needed you to give me the details.\u201d</p><p>Kelly flushed and scrunched his nose. \u201cOh yeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo . . . I need you to come somewhere with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo do what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to buy JD a suit that\u2019ll get him past security for the meeting tonight. And I don\u2019t feel like living through a Pretty Woman scene today, so I want you with me.\u201d</p><p>Kelly laughed before he could stop himself. \u201cWait so, Hagan and Cross are delving into historical mysteries, and we\u2019re going shopping?\u201d</p><p>Nick nodded, though he looked thoroughly disgusted with himself. Kelly grabbed Nick\u2019s face and kissed him. \u201cI love you, you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I know I\u2019m lucky,\u201d Nick rumbled.</p><p>Kelly kissed him again. \u201cDoes this count as a fight?\u201d</p><p>Nick hummed deeply. \u201cIt does if you want to rack up makeup sex for next time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll count it as a fight then.\u201d</p><p>Nick kissed him again, holding him tighter.</p><p>\u201cCan I get a new suit too?\u201d Kelly asked against his lips.</p><p>Nick bit him. \u201cAs long as I get to pick it out.\u201d</p><p>The task didn\u2019t take them particularly long. The suit they wound up getting JD wasn\u2019t perfectly tailored or anything, but it was close enough to pass Nick\u2019s rather critical inspection. He also got JD a few more items of clothing, because he\u2019d been borrowing jeans from Nick and shirts from Kelly, and neither fit him particularly well. JD kept promising to repay him, but Nick shrugged it off in the way only Nick could.</p><p>JD certainly looked more comfortable leaving the store in clothes that fit him well.</p><p>Nick dropped Kelly and JD off at the marina and told them to spiff up like they were getting a chance to walk the high-dol ar street corner, then left them. They were supposed to take a cab to meet up with Nick and Julian at the hotel that evening.</p><p>A few hours later, Kelly and JD were climbing out of a cab and gawking at the odd building that was the Liberty Hotel.</p><p>It was made of brick, and laid out in the cross shape of an old prison, which Kelly knew it had once been. A huge decorative window graced the front entrance, and a smiling doorman greeted them as he held the door for them. Kelly craned his neck to take in the impressive lobby. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJesus, this is cool,\u201d JD said. He was doing the same thing as Kelly, and they probably looked like chickens in the rain, staring at the wonders above them. The brick was all exposed, and so were the remains of the bars from the cells. The catwalks still encircled the lobby, where giant iron chandeliers displayed twinkling lights high overhead.</p><p>Kelly grinned. Of course Nick loved this place. It had everything Nick was drawn to: a dark history, a story of regeneration and retribution, luxurious surroundings, and alcohol. His breath caught when he saw the escalator that would take them to the main lobby floor and realized the man standing there watching him was his boyfriend.</p><p>Nick was wearing a sharp three-piece suit with a thin, green silk tie and matching handkerchief in his lapel pocket. It had likely been tailored, because it fit him perfectly. Kelly had never seen it on him before, but god damn. Nick was watching Kelly with a small smile, one hand in a pocket.</p> <p>Kelly whistled when he walked up to him. \u201cDon\u2019t you look fancy.\u201d</p><p>Nick stepped into him and kissed him on the corner of the mouth, right where he knew it would send shivers through Kelly\u2019s body. \u201cNot so bad yourself,\u201d he whispered into Kelly\u2019s ear.</p><p>It took Kelly a few seconds to realize Julian was with Nick, and that he and JD were waiting for them to stop flirting long enough to get on with things. They both looked a little amused, though.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Kelly offered.</p><p>Nick snorted. \u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d</p> <p>Though Nick was trying to keep an easy smile on his face, Kelly could feel the tension in Nick\u2019s body. It was making him nervous again. He supposed anyone meeting with a famous mob boss would be tense, but especially someone like Nick, who had childhood ties to the organization and a job that was inherently opposed to everything the mob stood for.</p><p>He was a white knight, stepping into the shadows.</p><p>\u201cCome on, he\u2019s upstairs waiting for us,\u201d Nick said.</p><p>A man was indeed waiting for them in the lobby when they reached the top of the escalator. He was attractive, with dark hair and kind eyes that seemed at odds with his job.</p><p>He was dressed in a soft-gray suit, his sky-blue tie the only anomaly. Nick slowed when he saw him, coming to a stop a few yards in front of him.</p><p>They stood opposite one another, silent, their expressions stern. Kelly glanced uneasily at Julian and JD. This was going to go so wrong. He could feel it, they were going to destroy this beautiful hotel lobby in a firefight.</p> <p>The man took a step forward, and Nick moved to meet him. Instead of violence, though, they embraced. The stranger patted Nick on the back and held a fistful of his hair as Nick hugged him. They broke apart and both men were smiling, although Kelly recognized the wistful glint in Nick\u2019s eyes.</p><p>This was a bittersweet reunion, at best.</p><p>\u201cDamn, you look good, Nicky,\u201d the man said, and he brushed at Nick\u2019s shoulders, grinning.</p><p>\u201cNo one calls me that anymore.\u201d Nick turned and waved a hand at Kelly, keeping his other hand on the man\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cMikey, this is Kelly Abbott.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe boyfriend?\u201d Mikey asked with a raised eyebrow.</p><p>Kelly didn\u2019t know how to answer that. He knew enough about mob and gang culture to know that having a \u201cboyfriend\u201d</p><p>usually got a man killed. Mikey stepped forward to shake his hand, though.</p> <p>\u201cWord went around town a few years ago Detective O\u2019Flaherty liked to play for the other team,\u201d Mikey said with a sideways grin at Nick. \u201cFirst thing Paddy did was lay down the law. No one touches him or his flavor of the month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that right?\u201d Nick\u2019s tone sent a chill up Kelly\u2019s spine.</p><p>Mikey nodded, still grinning at Kelly. \u201cThis one\u2019s more than just a taste, though, huh?\u201d</p><p>Nick met Kelly\u2019s eyes, his expression guarded and a little frightened. He obviously hadn\u2019t realized the mob had been keeping such close tabs on him, or that Kelly might have been in any kind of danger in the first place.</p><p>\u201cThese the two need the meeting?\u201d Mikey asked with a nod at Julian and JD.</p><p>\u201cSort of,\u201d Nick said. He introduced them, but he seemed a little thrown off his game now. Kelly was too. He stayed quiet, trusting Nick to lead them into the fray.</p><p>Mikey escorted them around the lobby, toward a hal way marking the ballroom and elevators to the jail hotel rooms.</p><p>They piled into the elevator, with Mikey putting his back against the wal . He might have greeted Nick warmly, but the man wasn\u2019t letting his guard down with them.</p><p>They rode to the second floor, which consisted of a private gallery bar that had once been the catwalk ringing the prison. When they filed out, Mikey took Nick by the arm and stopped him.</p><p>\u201cYou know what you\u2019re doing here, Nicky? Boston police detective asking Paddy for favors? Oh, son.\u201d</p><p>Nick gave him a curt nod. \u201cI got no other options. Friend of mine is in trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLife or death trouble?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the one.\u201d</p><p>A hint of sadness passed over Mikey\u2019s dark eyes, and he nodded slowly. He walked by them, leading them past the hostess toward a point in the middle of the catwalk where chairs and sofas had been set up in an isolated lounge.</p><p>Two large men stood in their path, both dressed impeccably in tailored suits. They refused to let the group pass.\u201cIt seems the sister organization in Boston is far better dressed than the ones in New York,\u201d Julian commented. He sounded like he approved.</p><p>A man sitting on a sofa behind the bodyguards stood and greeted them with a crooked smile. Something about it struck Kelly deep in his gut, like it was familiar to him. \u201cYou dress like a thug, you get treated like a thug,\u201d the man told them.</p><p>He pulled at his bow tie and raised a glass to them. \u201cNicholas, join me a moment, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Nick stepped forward and held his hands up so Mikey could pat him down. Then the bodyguards let him by, leaving Kelly and the others unable to get to him if anything went wrong. Kelly shifted from foot to foot, not liking the way any of this felt.</p><p>The man they called Paddy handed Nick a glass of champagne. \u201cTo celebrate your safe return from war.\u201d</p><p>Nick hesitated only briefly before touching the tip of his crystal glass to Paddy\u2019s and taking a sip. Kelly was fascinated and confused by the ritual. It seemed almost like Paddy was taunting Nick for coming to him for help, forcing him to consort with the very criminal element he had sworn an oath to protect the city against.</p><p>Nick set his glass on the table after a small sip, and Paddy did the same. \u201cGood then. Shall we take this upstairs?\u201d</p><p>The bodyguards backed the four of them against the railing as their boss walked by. They fell into step behind Paddy, and Kelly and the others followed, with Mikey bringing up the rear. They were instructed to wait for the next elevator, then left without escort in the vestibule.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Kelly asked as soon as they were alone.</p><p>\u201cWhy not just have us meet them in the room?\u201d</p><p>Nick cleared his throat, looking a little sick. \u201cA lobby full of people just saw a Boston police detective having a drink with a mob boss. Did you see the tourist with the camera on the floor above us?\u201d</p><p>Kelly shook his head.</p><p>\u201cAdded security,\u201d Julian commented. \u201cOne hint at corruption and it could bring the police force to its knees. I like it.\u201d</p><p>Nick scowled at Julian. \u201cTry not to keep reminding me that you\u2019re not a good person, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will do my very best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so nervous,\u201d JD announced. \u201cI might throw up on this suit.\u201d</p><p>Kelly shook his head. \u201cYou throw up, I throw up. Nobody wants that in an elevator.\u201d</p><p>JD laughed shakily.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Nick said. \u201cJust keep your mouth shut unless they ask you a direct question. Don\u2019t try to play them, just answer honestly.\u201d</p><p>Kelly stood beside Nick, staring at his profile, waiting until he got tired of feeling Kelly\u2019s eyes on him so he\u2019d look at him. Nick\u2019s jaw jumped and he swallowed heavily, but he never turned, never met Kelly\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this going to do to you, babe?\u201d Kelly finally asked him. \u201cWhat does it mean, owing Paddy a favor?\u201d</p><p>Nick licked his lips, a nervous habit he\u2019d nearly broken himself of over the years but which had returned full force when he\u2019d come home the last time. \u201cIt\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cO\u2019Flaherty,\u201d Julian said softly. \u201cI understand what you\u2019re doing. I can assure you, the next time you call I will answer.</p><p>No matter the reason.\u201d</p><p>Nick glanced over his shoulder, but never actually at Julian. He returned his eyes to the elevator doors. \u201cI do hope you mean that.\u201d</p><p>The elevator opened up before they could say more.</p><p>Nick\u2019s face could have been cut from marble when Kelly finally saw it.</p><p>Kelly had always wondered about those tales Nick had told of barely escaping the grasp of the mob, if Nick had simply been a young man exaggerating about a rough past because it gave him that added air of authority among the other Marines, or if he\u2019d been serious.</p><p>The look in his eyes now, of stark fear and resignation barely covered by steely determination, told Kelly he hadn\u2019t been exaggerating all those years ago.</p><p>Nick would go to the ends of the earth, carve out little pieces of his soul, to keep a promise. Kelly could see him carving away right now, preparing another piece to throw into the fire.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Kelly whispered. \u201cWhatever this costs you, I\u2019m here to pay it with you. Got it?\u201d</p><p>Nick\u2019s green eyes shone bright in the lights of the elevator. He leaned closer and kissed Kelly, his hand gentle on Kelly\u2019s cheek, his fingers trailing down Kelly\u2019s neck when he pulled away.</p><p>The elevator lurched to a stop, and Mikey was standing there waiting for them when the doors opened up. He had seen the last bit of their kiss, and he was pursing his lips and frowning. \u201cGot to tell you, Nicky, I\u2019m good with it and al , but it\u2019s still weird. You want to keep your face pretty, you might want to keep your hands inside the ride until you reach the exits.\u201d</p><p>Nick huffed a laugh, and they followed Mikey down the hal . Mikey turned to Kelly and patted him on the arm. \u201cThis guy taught me how to kiss when we were kids,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cLanded Mary Katherine McDowell on that lesson.\u201d</p><p>Kelly laughed despite the nerves roiling through him.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s that work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll show you later,\u201d Nick promised with an almost playful smile.</p><p>\u201cHey Nicky, does that make me gay by proxy?\u201d Mikey asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Mikey,\u201d Nick answered, deadpan. \u201cYeah it does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d They reached the room and Mikey turned his back to the door. He met Nick\u2019s eyes, his expression sobering.</p><p>\u201cYou know you\u2019re even with him right now,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>\u201cStill time to head back.\u201d</p><p>Nick didn\u2019t respond, merely returned Mikey\u2019s stare.</p><p>Mikey sighed heavily. \u201cIf you hadn\u2019t left, you\u2019d be in that room right now, and I\u2019d be screening your visitors. You know that, right?\u201d</p><p>Kelly could barely restrain the shock, or his questions. He looked between the two men, wide-eyed. How the fuck would Nick have ended up in that position when his childhood friend was still basically a bodyguard? Nick nodded curtly. \u201cThat\u2019s why I had to leave.\u201d</p><p>Mikey mimicked the nod, eyes melancholy and brow furrowed. Then he shook off the dark mood and gave the rest of them a grin that struck a little false. He pointed to Nick.</p><p>\u201cMost stand-up guy I ever known.\u201d</p><p>Pure devastation flashed in Nick\u2019s eyes as Mikey spoke.</p><p>Kelly wanted to reach out to him, to comfort him somehow.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t think even he could make this better for Nick.</p><p>Mikey patted each of them down, being pretty thorough about it, and then he knocked on the suite door. It was opened by one of the bodyguards from before, who allowed them into the suite.</p><p>Kelly couldn\u2019t stop himself from gawking. He could see more and more why Nick had wanted to bring him here for a little romance. Hints of the brick from the original jail 160 structure showed along the outer wal , but the majority of the wall consisted of an enormous decorative window, just like the one that had greeted them at the front entrance.</p><p>The room had been rearranged, with more seating being brought in to accommodate everyone. Paddy sat near the window, smoking a cigar. He gestured for them to join him.</p><p>One of the bodyguards stopped them, though, stepping in front of Nick when he moved forward. Nick didn\u2019t back away, merely side-eyed the larger man, jaw tightening. Kelly cursed internally and slid a little so he was in front of JD if things went south.</p><p>\u201cNeed to check you over one more time,\u201d the bodyguard told Nick. There was something in his voice, though, a taunt perhaps. Enjoyment. Kelly got the feeling that Mikey\u2019s attitude in regards to Nick\u2019s sexual orientation was perhaps the outlier in this organization. Keep your hands inside the ride, indeed.</p><p>\u201cBe gentle with that one,\u201d Paddy warned, and he sounded amused.</p><p>The bodyguard sniffed, then grabbed Nick\u2019s arm and turned him, shoving him against the wal . Nick hit hard, slamming his face and chest. The man kicked Nick\u2019s feet apart, then pressed his hand against the back of Nick\u2019s head and rammed Nick\u2019s cheek into the plaster again. Kelly jerked to move, but Julian\u2019s hand on his elbow stopped him. If they started a fight here, they\u2019d all leave the hotel in body bags.</p><p>Nick\u2019s face was turned away from them, so Kelly couldn\u2019t see his eyes, couldn\u2019t gauge his expression. Kelly gritted his teeth, preparing to watch this guy manhandle his lover and unable to do anything about it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWatch the suit, huh?\u201d Nick said, and his voice was deceptively calm.</p><p>The bodyguard laughed. As soon as he took a step back and gave Nick enough room, Nick brought his elbow hard into the man\u2019s temple, then spun and kicked him, grabbing for the holster under the man\u2019s jacket and pul ing the gun away as he stumbled back from the kick. It was all dizzyingly fast, even for Kelly, who had seen the move plenty of times before.</p><p>With a few rapid flicks of his fingers, Nick had pulled the slide off the Glock and dropped the magazine to the floor. He stepped on the magazine, then dropped the gun and tossed the slide toward Mikey, who caught it with a grin as wide as a cartoon cat.</p> <p>The bodyguard got to his feet again, glaring at Nick and flexing his shoulders. His nose was bloody.</p><p>Paddy cackled gleefully. \u201cTold you to be gentle with that one. Now get the fuck on that door, both of you,\u201d he added, waving at the bodyguards. \u201cFucking useless bastards.\u201d</p><p>They grudgingly took up their posts on the door, but not before the bloody one pointed at Nick and murmured a threat under his breath. Nick watched him, only turning back to face Paddy once he was between JD and the bodyguard.</p><p>Paddy stood and came closer, opening his arms for a hug that Nick returned stiffly. The mob boss pulled him close like he was embracing a son, though, patting him on the back and then on his head like a proud father might before pul ing him over to the couches. \u201cBeen a while, Nicky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one calls him that anymore, boss,\u201d Mikey informed him with a cheeky grin.</p> <p>Paddy gave Nick\u2019s cheek an affectionate tap, then sat.</p><p>He gestured for all of them to take seats. Kelly was confused again. Nick had been so tense, so worried, but this was a warmer reception than Nick received at his own home when he visited.</p><p>Paddy propped one leg on his other knee and reclined, arms on the back of the sofa. He surveyed the four of them.</p><p>Julian had remained standing, his arms crossed. Mikey stood beside him, hands in his pockets, looking at ease. JD and Kelly flanked Nick on the sofa. They waited silently while Paddy looked them over.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d he finally said. \u201cYou need my help again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be here if I didn\u2019t,\u201d Nick said, words coated in ice.</p> <p>Paddy laughed. He pointed at Nick while glancing at Kelly. \u201cSo fucking stubborn. He ever told you this story?\u201d</p><p>Kelly shook his head, then remembered Nick\u2019s warning about being respectful. \u201cNo, sir.\u201d</p><p>Paddy grunted. \u201cFirst time I saw these two chuckleheads, they were sixteen, walking down the street from baseball practice. That one had a black eye.\u201d He pointed at Nick again. \u201cLooked so much like my son, Patrick Jr. Lost him to a goddamn drunk driver the year before. Saw Nicky and thought he was a ghost. I stopped my car, called to him, asked him how he got that shiner. And this fucking kid, he looks me straight in the eye. You know how many people look me straight in the eye, even back then?\u201d</p><p>Kelly shrugged uncomfortably.</p><p>\u201cNo fucking one.\u201d He looked back at Nick almost sadly.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t take a fucking genius to figure out his old man was knocking him around, so I asked him, big kid like you, why don\u2019t you knock back? He meets my eyes again and he says, \u2018\u2019Cause I got people more important than me at home to take care of, Paddy.\u2019 He fucking knew who I was. Wasn\u2019t afraid of me.\u201d</p><p>Kelly glanced at Nick, his heart aching. \u201cWith a father like his, why should he be afraid of anyone?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>\u201cYou damn right,\u201d Paddy snarled. \u201cDamn right. I told him I\u2019d help him out. I\u2019d protect his sisters if he\u2019d protect me. He was good on his word, and I was good on mine. Even gave him a ride to the airport and paid for his fucking ticket to go to Parris Island when it was time. I had pride in my heart for this boy just like he was my own son.\u201d</p> <p>Kelly\u2019s eyes widened. He\u2019d never heard any of this. Nick was stone-faced, though, not reacting at all to the information being revealed, or to the almost kind words the notorious criminal was saying about him.</p><p>\u201cHe came back home and went to work for the other guy,\u201d Paddy said with a sigh. \u201cAlways were the good egg no matter how hard I tried to boil you. So you come to me asking for help, I\u2019m giving it to you. No questions asked.\u201d</p><p>Nick swallowed hard. \u201cMikey told you what we\u2019re looking for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did.\u201d Paddy gave Mikey a nod.</p><p>Kelly didn\u2019t like the fact that Mikey was moving around behind him, but he was trying not to be tense or appear nervous. He had to trust Julian to watch their backs for them, which was admittedly a little hard to do.</p><p>\u201cYou have a lead for us?\u201d Nick asked, growing impatient.</p><p>\u201cBetter.\u201d</p><p>Mikey set a reinforced suitcase on the table between them, and Paddy leaned over to put in a code, then prop the lid open. He turned it to display the contents to them with a flourish.</p><p>On the cushioned interior of black felt sat a sparkling piece of jewelry. Roughly four inches wide, with bright-blue enamel that was covered in diamonds, emeralds, and rubies.</p><p>Kelly recognized it as the star brooch from Julian\u2019s photo.</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ,\u201d Julian blurted.</p><p>Nick lowered his head, rubbing his hands over his face.</p><p>He\u2019d just been shown stolen goods and was powerless to do anything about it. It had to be killing his sense of duty. Kelly put his hand on Nick\u2019s knee.</p><p>\u201cA replica, of course, of the one stolen and smuggled into Boston a century ago,\u201d Paddy said cheekily. \u201cI keep it to . . .</p><p>honor our Irish roots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Nick grunted. He sat forward, looking but not touching.</p><p>\u201cWhat exactly is it you need from this?\u201d Mikey asked.</p><p>Nick gave him a wary glance. \u201cIt\u2019s supposed to point to a location.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike a treasure map?\u201d Mikey asked.</p><p>Nick nodded.</p><p>JD slid off the sofa to his knees, his fingers gripping the table. \u201cMay I touch it?\u201d he asked. It was the first thing he\u2019d said since the elevator. He\u2019d obviously forgotten he was scared.</p><p>Paddy merely chuckled. He waved for JD to go ahead.</p><p>They crowded around it, scowling at the priceless piece like it was a Rubik\u2019s Cube instead of a treasure that had gone missing over a hundred years ago. The emeralds were stunningly green, and they made up a clover in the center of the field of diamonds. Brilliant red rubies formed an X behind it. But there was nothing else. Just precious gems. No message, no sign. Nothing that would point in any way to a location or clue.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d Julian said. He was leaning over the back of the couch, breathing down their necks. \u201cThey said it would be there.\u201d</p><p>Nick massaged the bridge of his nose. \u201cIs it possible these people wanted you to locate this instead of something more?\u201d</p><p>he asked.</p><p>\u201cGood luck to them, if that\u2019s the case,\u201d Julian said with a salute toward Paddy.</p><p>\u201cWhy did they think it would be here?\u201d Kelly asked.</p><p>\u201cThe man responsible for the design was a descendant of the soldier who hid the stolen goods,\u201d Julian explained.</p><p>\u201cThere were several accounts, private accounts, that the clues to its whereabouts were passed along.\u201d</p><p>JD tore his attention away from the star to turn it to Paddy. \u201cDo you have a loupe?\u201d</p><p>Paddy rubbed his finger across the tip of his nose, nodding.</p><p>He gestured for one of the men at the door to retrieve it.</p><p>Nick still had his head down, his thumbs massaging his temples. \u201cThis treasure hunt is just as pointless as the one we send those kids on every summer.\u201d</p><p>Kelly patted his knee, trying to offer some sort of comfort.</p><p>Nick had just sold his soul to get a look at this thing, all for nothing. The memory of Nick\u2019s notes for that treasure hunt flashed through Kelly\u2019s mind. Then it hit him.</p><p>\u201cOh my God, it\u2019s a pigpen cipher!\u201d he blurted.</p><p>Nick raised his head, blinking rapidly at Kelly then glancing at the star in JD\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cLook it,\u201d Kelly said, reaching to take it from JD. He drew his finger across the rubies, then pointed at each tip of the clover so they could envision it. It formed a perfect piece to a pigpen cipher, with the shapes of the clover creating the message.</p><p>\u201cMotherfucker,\u201d Nick breathed.</p><p>\u201cWhat does it mean?\u201d Julian demanded.</p><p>\u201cPigpen ciphers are usually dots, but this is shapes,\u201d Nick told him. \u201cThree circles and an arch. I know arches are supposed to represent power, monarchy, manliness . . . sometimes the warrior class. But this one\u2019s on its head, I have no idea what that means. And circles, I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said there were more pieces stolen when this was?\u201d</p><p>Kelly asked. \u201cI bet together, they form a complete cipher.\u201d</p><p>Nick nodded toward Paddy. \u201cAny ideas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe other pieces, I can\u2019t help you with,\u201d Paddy told them.</p><p>\u201cYou can imagine that stealing the Irish Crown Jewels brought enough attention; keeping them together as a collection would have been . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cStupid,\u201d Nick provided.</p><p>Paddy gave them that crooked grin again, and again it made Kelly uneasy.</p><p>\u201cWhere the other pieces ended up, I don\u2019t know. You could speak to our . . . brethren in New York. Chicago. But even I can\u2019t get a cop through their doors for a treasure hunt, kiddo.\u201d</p><p>Nick\u2019s jaw tightened and he nodded.</p><p>\u201cMaybe there\u2019s more etched in the stones,\u201d JD said. He pointed to the jeweler\u2019s loupe Nosebleed was bringing them.</p><p>They were all silent as JD examined the stones for markings.</p><p>After a few minutes, he sighed and set the star brooch and the loupe down on the cushion. \u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere does that leave us?\u201d Julian asked.</p><p>\u201cWith a very expensive . . . copy,\u201d Nick answered, voice gone soft with defeat. His eyes were locked on Paddy\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Paddy said, and he clapped his hands together.</p><p>\u201cIt seems our meeting has come to an end.\u201d He climbed to his feet, and they all stood with him. He reached for Nick\u2019s hand, shaking it warmly, and a moment later he pulled Nick into another hug. For an infamous mob boss, he sure did seem fond of the police.</p><p>This time, Nick returned the embrace a bit more sincerely.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Nick said, almost inaudible.</p><p>Paddy tapped Nick\u2019s cheek with the tips of his fingers.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be a stranger, kiddo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t hold your breath, old man.\u201d</p><p>Paddy barked a laugh. \u201cThis make us even?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got one more left,\u201d Nick told him. \u201cMark it in your damn book so your boys know it.\u201d</p><p>Paddy was still chuckling when the door closed behind them.</p><p>\u201cOne more?\u201d Mikey asked Nick as he led them to the elevator. Nick was silent, but Kelly wished like hell Mikey would press him for details so Kelly wouldn\u2019t have to later.</p><p>Mikey stopped him in the middle of the hal , standing in front of him with his hand on Nick\u2019s chest. \u201cYou telling me Paddy owed you a solid? Owed you two solids?\u201d</p><p>A slow, crooked smile spread across Nick\u2019s face. It was his only response.</p><p>\u201cJesus fucking Christ, you fucking fucker,\u201d Mikey said affectionately, and he stepped aside so they could continue on to the elevator. Kelly punched the button. Mikey pulled Nick into a hug, squeezing him tightly. \u201cYou be careful out there, huh? You left Boston to save your fucking life and then spent every fucking day trying to die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch your fucking mouth.\u201d Nick patted him on the back of the head, and then they released each other. \u201cYou get in trouble, you know who to cal .\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnybody but you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Nick drawled, and stepped into the elevator with the others. Mikey stood there grinning, his hands in his suit pockets as the doors closed.</p><p>\u201cHow the bleeding hell do you acquire not one, but two favors from the Irish mob?\u201d Julian demanded on the way down.</p><p>Nick remained silent. For one, he kind of enjoyed frustrating Julian. And two, you acquired favors from the Irish mob by keeping your damn mouth shut about how you did it.</p><p>They reached the bottom floor and Nick led the way to Alibi, the restaurant situated amidst the remains of the old jail cells on the bottom floor. As in the lobby, the walls were brick and the iron bars were still set into the windows and doors where the cells had once stood. The room was littered with little pods of comfortable chairs and love seats, and the tables were just big enough to set a few glasses and a plate of appetizers on.</p><p>They took up residence in a corner, where the lights faced away from them and no one would look their way.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s funny,\u201d JD said as soon as he sat down. \u201cAlibi.\u201d</p><p>They all stared at him.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t tell me that\u2019s not funny. I don\u2019t care,\u201d he insisted. \u201cIrony.\u201d</p><p>Nick finally chuckled.</p><p>\u201cI lied,\u201d JD blurted, and though he kept his voice at a whisper, it was obvious he had been desperate to say the words.</p><p>Nick looked up from his menu, eyes pinning JD before he could speak again. JD met his stare and flinched. He was astute enough to see the distrust in Nick\u2019s expression. He looked wounded, but he continued. \u201cThe star,\u201d he said quickly.</p><p>\u201cIt did have something on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Kelly asked.</p><p>\u201cThe diamonds inside the clover, there were symbols etched on them.\u201d</p><p>Nick sat back, a mixture of relief and irritation flowing through him. \u201cYou didn\u2019t want them to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I figured the less people who know about this, the better. Especially people who steal priceless treasures and hoard them in suitcases.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFair enough.\u201d Nick cleared his throat. \u201cDo me a favor and never Google your real name, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo reason.\u201d Nick raised his hand for a waitress. \u201cI need a fucking drink.\u201d</p> <p>When the first round came, JD took one of the napkins from beneath his glass and drew the cross and clover on it.</p><p>Inside each leaf of the clover, he wrote the symbols he\u2019d seen.</p><p>Kelly had his phone out, frowning at the screen.</p><p>Nick leaned toward him. They were sharing a love seat, so he scooted closer, sliding his hand between Kelly\u2019s thighs so it would look like they were merely lovebirds on a date rather than a group of men who\u2019d just met the most notorious criminal in Boston and were now here drinking so Paddy and his boys could slip out the back of the hotel without being seen. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooking up what circles mean.\u201d</p> <p>Nick tightened his grip, squeezing his thigh and pul ing him closer. He whispered in his ear. \u201cNo beginning. No end.\u201d</p><p>Kelly tried to turn his head, but Nick nudged his cheek with his nose, refusing to let him move just yet. He closed his eyes and rested his forehead against Kelly\u2019s temple. \u201cLike a wedding ring. Represents eternity.\u201d</p><p>Kelly finally leaned away and turned to meet Nick\u2019s eyes.</p><p>Nick couldn\u2019t tell what color his eyes were tonight in the low light of the restaurant. He thought they might be gray.</p><p>Nick kissed him before Kelly could speak. \u201cI love you,\u201d he whispered. His words came out almost desperate and he wasn\u2019t entirely sure why. Kelly had just seen a part of him he\u2019d hoped no one would ever see. He didn\u2019t know what Kelly would do with that.</p><p>\u201cDo you two need to go to your room?\u201d Julian asked with a long-suffering sigh.</p> <p>\u201cSoon,\u201d Kelly answered, his voice hoarse and serious.</p><p>He gave Nick a barely perceptible nod and they both sat up straighter. Kelly cleared his throat. \u201cThis says the circles can represent anything from eternity to fidelity to the meeting of the spirit and matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpirit and matter?\u201d Julian repeated. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe solid line encircling the inner part that\u2019s made of nothing,\u201d Kelly summarized as he read what he\u2019d found on his phone. He clicked it off and put it away.</p><p>\u201cThe sideways arch?\u201d JD asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s probably just an arch,\u201d Nick guessed. \u201cThey had to work in the confines of their task, which was to make it look like a clover. Instead of a straight line, though, they chose to curve it to make it an arch. What numbers did we end up with?\u201d</p><p>JD handed him the napkin. He had drawn the star, with circles representing each gem. He\u2019d shaded in the pieces that were red or green, and copied the writing on the diamonds.</p><p>They weren\u2019t numbers after al , but more symbols.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure this is right?\u201d Nick asked.</p><p>JD nodded, looking a little perturbed that Nick would question his memory.</p><p>\u201cSeriously, you\u2019re giving me a bitchface for doubting the memory of someone who can\u2019t remember his own name?\u201d</p><p>JD tried to maintain his frown, but he finally snorted and gave Nick a sheepish smile. \u201cIt\u2019s correct. I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a pigpen cipher,\u201d Nick said. \u201cThere aren\u2019t enough letters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many are represented?\u201d Julian asked.</p><p>\u201cJust eight. You have the four symbols in the cross that are represented by the emeralds, then he has four more here within the diamonds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo eight symbols. With no point of reference as to what they mean,\u201d Kelly concluded. \u201cGreat.\u201d</p><p>Nick was still shaking his head, examining the napkin. He was at a complete loss. \u201cI . . . I don\u2019t know what to do with this.</p><p>I don\u2019t know where we go from here with this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold on,\u201d Julian said with a wave of his hand. \u201cYou\u2019re not giving up, are you? This is information the others don\u2019t have, information they won\u2019t get unless they intend to go to the bloody mob for it. Not many people have the stones to do what you just did. We\u2019re finally a step ahead. And we have him now; they don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>JD was nodding his head with Julian\u2019s words. \u201cI don\u2019t remember any of the important things, but I sure as hell remember this stuff,\u201d JD told them. \u201cWe can do this. We can get there ahead of them.\u201d</p><p>Nick narrowed his eyes and cocked his head at JD. \u201cYou\u2019re very eager to get to this treasure.\u201d</p><p>JD sighed heavily. \u201cYou still suspect me? My motives? That\u2019s fine, Detective, because I do too. I don\u2019t remember why I was there with people who would rob and kill. I don\u2019t know why I hid those things from the people I was supposed to be working with. Maybe I was a hostage like his boyfriend.</p><p>Maybe I was there of my own free will and I decided to cheat them out of something I found. I don\u2019t know. But you know what, Nick, I know there\u2019s at least one person out there who does know the answers to those questions. And that person is looking for this same treasure. That\u2019s who I want to find, that\u2019s why I\u2019m eager. If you want to arrest me and put me in a cell, you go ahead and do it, but one thing I know for damn sure is that I\u2019m your best shot at this, and no matter what my motivation was for being there, I\u2019m here right now for the three of you. Because you\u2019re the only people in the world I know well enough to care about right now.\u201d</p><p>Nick and the others stared at him, stunned by his outburst.</p><p>It was the first hint of real heat Nick had seen from him.</p><p>JD stood and straightened his suit, closing his eyes. \u201cAm I under arrest, or can I go to the room and get some sleep now?\u201d</p><p>Nick was torn between respecting the man for standing up to him and being upset with himself for not hiding his suspicions better. He nodded, and JD turned away without another word.</p><p>Julian tossed back what was left of his drink and stood.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try to calm him. Keep an eye on him. Good night,\u201d he added with a nod to them both.</p><p>Nick sat forward and held his head in his hands, groaning softly. Kelly\u2019s fingers were tentative on his back, at first. Then he placed his palm on Nick\u2019s spine and left it there.</p><p>\u201cYour instincts are telling you to trust him. He\u2019ll be here in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly people he knows well enough to care about. Jesus Christ, just stab me in the heart already.\u201d</p><p>Kel y chuckled. \u201cHe sounded a little like you there. All self-righteous logic and sass. Let\u2019s go to bed, huh?\u201d</p><p>Nick looked back at him, and Kelly gave him an exaggerated leer.</p><p>\u201cYou know what, fuck it,\u201d Nick growled. He held up his hand for the waitress, ordering another round of drinks.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing? I thought we were going to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we\u2019re not. I\u2019m having drinks with my boyfriend at one of my favorite places in the city.\u201d Nick sat back and slipped his hand over Kelly\u2019s thigh again. He squeezed and pulled Kelly closer, sliding him on the leather love seat.</p><p>Kelly laughed and ran his teeth across his lower lip. \u201cDoes that make this a date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019d be our first real one if it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst date includes stolen treasure and the mob. How romantic. And fitting.\u201d Kelly leaned closer, smirking. He kissed Nick before Nick could come up with any clever responses. Kelly\u2019s hand found its way into the pocket of Nick\u2019s tailored suit pants.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Nick warned. He knew he\u2019d jump on the chance to vent his frustration, and he didn\u2019t want to be banned from this bar for indecency.</p><p>Kelly grinned against the kiss. \u201cWhy, Detective? You don\u2019t mind making me come all over my sweatpants in the car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t pay a thousand dol ars for your sweatpants,\u201d Nick gritted out as Kelly\u2019s fingers brushed against his thigh.</p><p>\u201cI could hire a high-class hooker cheaper than I could replace this suit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you offering to pay me?\u201d Kelly asked, eyes sparkling.</p><p>Nick growled in the back of his throat and fished Kelly\u2019s hand out of his pocket. \u201cNo, but I will fuck you into oblivion as soon as we get to the room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, just keep your hands out of my pants.\u201d</p><p>Kelly laughed. The sound was like a balm on Nick\u2019s fraying nerves. He squeezed Kelly\u2019s thigh tighter, keeping his fingers between Kelly\u2019s knees as they drank and talked for the next hour. Nick would have given anything to have left as soon as Kelly\u2019s lips had touched his, to take him upstairs and just take him as many times as they could handle.</p><p>But they were here for a reason. He had to be seen tonight.</p><p>\u201cHow do you earn a favor from the mob?\u201d Kelly asked after his seventh or eighth drink.</p><p>Nick almost spit his alcohol all over the table. He had to struggle to swallow, and he set his drink down before he could spill it. He leaned closer to Kelly, his voice full of gravel. \u201cYou keep your fucking mouth shut in public, that\u2019s how.\u201d</p><p>Kelly blinked at him, then nodded obediently. He stared into Nick\u2019s eyes for another few seconds, and then a smile spread over his lips. \u201cThat actually made me shiver. Can you do that again?\u201d</p><p>Nick\u2019s lips twitched.</p><p>\u201cNo seriously, that was the hottest you\u2019ve ever been. Will you threaten me when you\u2019re fucking me later? Or better yet, will you just fuck me right here?\u201d</p><p>Nick laughed, and he stood to straighten his suit. He picked up his glass and finished off his drink, then held his hand down for Kelly. Kelly wavered when Nick pulled him off the couch.</p><p>\u201cOh, this is going to be fun,\u201d Nick hissed in his ear as he guided him between the chairs and the table.</p><p>Kelly slowed enough that Nick pressed into him from behind. \u201cI\u2019m not going to make it to the room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not that drunk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I am that horny. This place is dark, I bet no one will notice.\u201d</p><p>Nick shoved him ahead, ushering him out of the bar. It took every ounce of willpower Nick had to not pull Kelly close and grind against him on the escalator. Kelly obviously didn\u2019t give a shit about decorum, because he stepped into Nick\u2019s space and tugged at his belt.</p><p>\u201cControl yourself,\u201d Nick ground out, trying to keep calm.</p><p>The entire lobby could see people on the escalator. He didn\u2019t want to give anyone a show. Actually, he did. But he wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the fun in that?\u201d Kelly challenged. He stuck his tongue between his teeth, grinning, then he hopped off the escalator when they reached the top, pul ing Nick by his belt.</p><p>Nick finally pried Kelly\u2019s fingers off the belt and held Kelly\u2019s hand instead.</p><p>\u201cI like this,\u201d Kelly said as they strolled across the lobby, fingers twined. \u201cHolding your hand. Walking around. You in that suit, Jesus Christ.\u201d</p><p>Nick pulled him closer, bringing his hand up to kiss it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll remember that.\u201d</p><p>They got to the elevator without incident, and without public indecency, but as soon as the elevator doors closed, Kelly grabbed Nick and shoved him against the wal . His hand worked at Nick\u2019s belt and the buttons of his vest, and he kicked Nick\u2019s feet apart so he could slip himself between Nick\u2019s thighs and press their groins together.</p><p>Nick grasped at Kelly\u2019s hips, holding on to him so he wouldn\u2019t fall on his ass as his shoes slid against the marble floor. Kelly kissed him messily, his movements just sloppy enough to turn Nick on even more. He fucking loved when Kelly got like this. It went rough and messy and loud.</p><p>He grunted a warning that he was about to move them, and Kelly moaned in response, wrapping his arms around Nick\u2019s neck. Nick spun them, pressing Kelly against the array of buttons.</p><p>Kelly grabbed two handfuls of Nick\u2019s hair and yanked.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Nick hissed. He rubbed his hardened cock against Kelly\u2019s. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t have waited five more fucking minutes to start this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Kelly gasped. \u201cI am, but I couldn\u2019t fucking help it. You went all fucking badass evil mastermind on me with the Irish mob. Then you were talking about beginnings and ends and eternity and rings and that fucking tone of voice you use when you get all hard and drunk. God! This is your fault!\u201d</p><p>The elevator dinged, and Nick slammed his palm against the emergency stop button. The lights flickered and the elevator shuddered to a stop. He pressed closer.</p><p>Kelly blinked up at the emergency lights. \u201cYou\u2019re really going to fuck me in the elevator, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Nick hissed. Although he did want to. Badly. \u201cNot enough lube to go half as hard at you as I want to. I\u2019m going to take you back to our room. I\u2019m going to bend you over the end of our fucking bed, and I\u2019m going to fill you so full of me you\u2019ll be screaming in a Boston accent. Make you forget everything you saw and heard tonight.\u201d</p><p>Kelly licked his lips slowly. \u201cPromise?\u201d</p><p>Nick closed his eyes, taking a deep breath before hitting the button again. The doors slid open, and Nick escorted Kelly out with a hand on his lower back. Thankfully there was no one there to see their disheveled suits or flushed faces.</p><p>He\u2019d had his share of exhibitionist moments, and most had been well worth it. He didn\u2019t want that with Kelly, though.</p><p>He wanted Kelly all to himself.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a fucking white knight when you start drinking.\u201d Kelly flopped against the wall beside their door, nestling into the corner of the part that jutted out around the doors. \u201cYour alcohol tolerance sucks for you, but it\u2019s awesome for me.\u201d</p><p>Nick blocked him in and bent to kiss his neck. \u201cJust means I get to take advantage of you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI love it when you do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you do,\u201d Nick purred against Kelly\u2019s ear. Kelly shivered all over, and Nick held him tighter so he could feel it.</p><p>Kelly rested his head against the wal , clumsy fingers working at Nick\u2019s belt. \u201cEternity rings and manly soldiers.</p> <p>You Irish really know how to seduce a guy.\u201d</p><p>Nick hummed against Kelly\u2019s neck as he kissed and nipped.</p><p>His entire body thrummed with bourbon and electricity.</p><p>Kelly\u2019s hands on him were kicking him into overdrive.</p><p>Kelly\u2019s words finally sank through the haze, though, and Nick lifted his head.</p> <p>Kelly spread his hands over Nick\u2019s stomach, bunching his fingers against Nick\u2019s vest as he worked the buttons loose.</p><p>\u201cWhat? What\u2019s wrong? If you don\u2019t have the room key I\u2019m going to kill you. Or give you a sloppy blowjob in a hal way, whatever.\u201d He gave Nick\u2019s dress shirt a yank, and buttons went flying.</p><p>\u201cMotherfucker,\u201d Nick hissed as Kelly laughed raucously.</p><p>Nick fought past the al ure of Kelly\u2019s hands on him and asked, \u201cWhat did you say before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said if you don\u2019t open the door and fuck me, I\u2019m dropping to my knees right here in the hal way.\u201d To emphasize his point, he pulled the zipper on Nick\u2019s pants and popped the button free. \u201cActually I like that plan, key or not.\u201d</p><p>The image tore through Nick, almost wiping his mind clean of any other thought. He even reached up to grab Kelly\u2019s hair, his fist tightening in preparation of holding on while he thrust into Kelly\u2019s mouth later. But he shook his head, fighting the niggling feeling that he was missing something. \u201cBefore that,\u201d he said, and his voice was hoarse. \u201cWhat\u2019d you say?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUh, about the Irish?\u201d Kelly asked. \u201cWhite knights? Circles and arches and eternity and warriors? I don\u2019t know, I talked a lot tonight, you shouldn\u2019t let me do that when I\u2019m drunk.\u201d</p><p>Nick grabbed Kelly\u2019s face with both hands. \u201cEternity.</p><p>Spirit meeting matter. Archways. Warriors.\u201d They stared at each other for a few seconds, and then Nick made a sound like an animal in pain as he backed away from Kelly and slapped himself in the forehead. \u201cGod! Why the fuck couldn\u2019t I have figured that out an hour from now?\u201d he shouted.</p><p>\u201cWhat, figured what out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a cemetery,\u201d Nick hissed. \u201cThe star points us to a cemetery.\u201d</p><p>Nick zipped up his pants and stalked off, heading toward JD\u2019s and Julian\u2019s room.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Kelly called after him. \u201cDoes this mean I\u2019m not getting fucked, because I don\u2019t like this new plan at al !\u201d</p><p>Nick stopped in the middle of the hall and turned. Kelly was standing in front of their door, his hair mussed, his suit awry, his cock obviously hard, his hands out like he couldn\u2019t believe Nick had just walked away. But he was still smiling.</p> <p>Kelly was always smiling.</p><p>Nick glanced at the door of the other men\u2019s room, then back to Kelly. Kelly deserved better than being abandoned for a treasure hunt. When it came right down to it, if Nick had a choice to make, he\u2019d always choose Kelly. \u201cFuck it, it can wait \u2019til morning.\u201d</p><p>He fished the key out of his pocket and headed back to his lover. Kelly\u2019s grin widened and he began to unbutton his own shirt in anticipation. Nick grabbed him around the waist, kissing him, then lifting him to his toes to deepen the kiss. Kelly\u2019s hands were once again in his hair.</p><p>\u201cYou trying to sweep me off my feet?\u201d Kelly asked, a little breathless.</p><p>Nick grinned. \u201cNo. But I am going to take you up on that sloppy blowjob you offered.\u201d</p><p>Kelly cackled as Nick dragged him inside. \u201cWho says romance is dead?\u201d</p><p>Nick attacked his clothes, dropping the expensive material here and there. They both kicked clumsily out of their shoes, and Kelly wasn\u2019t even out of his briefs before Nick tossed him onto the bed. Kelly stretched out, pushing his briefs down as he scooted closer to the middle of the king-sized bed. Though he\u2019d seen Kelly\u2019s hard body a thousand times before, he still nearly stumbled over his own feet when his eyes raked over the ornate six-shooter tattoo spanning from the juncture of Kelly\u2019s thigh to his lower ribs and highlighting the muscle beneath it.</p><p>Nick tossed his last piece of clothing away and stood at the side of the bed, admiring his lover. Kelly\u2019d had that six- shooter ever since Nick had known him, and Nick had always loved it and not quite known why.</p><p>\u201cI thought I was going to get on my knees and let you fuck my mouth like a cheap whore,\u201d Kelly drawled. \u201cI mean, since you can\u2019t afford a high-dol ar escort with your pants.\u201d</p><p>There was a sparkle in his eyes. He knew exactly what he did 180 to Nick when he started talking like that. When he laid that tight body out for Nick to gaze upon.</p><p>\u201cYou were, but plans change,\u201d Nick growled. He dug in his overnight bag and pulled out two things, showing them to Kelly for him to choose which would come first: a tube of lubricant, or the little red flip camera they kept for . . . special occasions.</p><p>\u201cCamera,\u201d Kelly gasped. \u201cOh God, yeah. The camera.\u201d</p><p>Nick crawled onto the bed, wrapping Kelly\u2019s hips in his arms and pul ing him closer. He handed him the flip cam, and Kelly scrambled to turn it on so he could catch the first touch of Nick\u2019s tongue to his cock.</p><p>Ten minutes later, Nick was on his back, Kelly straddling his chest and fucking his mouth as he filmed it. He wasn\u2019t going easy; he was far too drunk for that. But the rougher he was with Nick, the harder he pulled Nick\u2019s hair, the deeper he thrust even after Nick nearly gagged on him, the more he bruised Nick\u2019s lips, the more turned on Nick became.</p><p>Kelly arched over him, gritting his teeth and shouting Nick\u2019s name. He cried out again and met Nick\u2019s eyes, fist clenched in his hair. \u201cIf I came all over your face, you\u2019d take it out on my ass, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Nick dug his fingers into Kelly\u2019s hips, nodding.</p><p>Kelly turned the video camera to face him, and gave it a sly smile. \u201cNot usually recommended, but this is going to be worth it.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 8</p><p>Selly groaned when the light lanced through Khis eyelids. He buried his face in the mattress, burrowing under his pillow.</p><p>Someone picked the pillow up and tapped his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Kelly griped. \u201cFuck PT, dude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet dressed, babe, it\u2019s almost six.\u201d</p><p>Kelly sat up too fast, and his head swam. His stomach churned briefly, but he got it under control. He was surprised to find not just Nick in the room, sitting on the end of the bed, but also Julian and JD loitering near the doorway. \u201cJesus, how long did I sleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to your neck?\u201d JD blurted.</p><p>Kelly gingerly touched his neck. \u201cSomething about . . .</p><p>holding on to the headboard. I can\u2019t remember. Jesus, what was in those drinks?\u201d</p><p>Nick chuckled darkly. He pulled a boot on and stood to stamp his foot against the ground. Then he sat again and laced it up.\u201cHow\u2019d you come up with cemetery?\u201d Julian asked Nick.</p><p>\u201cCall it divine inspiration.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m betting God was invoked a lot last night,\u201d JD said under his breath.</p><p>\u201cShhh,\u201d Kelly begged. He put a hand to his head. \u201cWhat are we doing, why are we up? Oh my God in Heaven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are two main cemeteries we need to look at,\u201d Nick explained. \u201cIf we start early, we won\u2019t have to split up to cover the ground.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we\u2019ve proven we work better as a hive mind than we do solo,\u201d JD added.</p><p>\u201cIndeed,\u201d Nick agreed cheekily.</p><p>Kelly was groaning when he rolled out of bed. He had to hold his head to make sure it stayed attached. \u201cLet me shower and throw up,\u201d he muttered. He wobbled toward the bathroom, not even self-conscious about being bare-assed naked. Especially odd since he was pretty sure there was a bite mark on his ass. If they didn\u2019t want to see him post-fuck, though, they shouldn\u2019t have been in his room at six in the morning.</p><p>Julian merely rolled his eyes as Kelly walked by, but JD tried his best not to look. Kelly patted him on the shoulder, then slid the pocket door to the bathroom closed and promptly threw up everything he\u2019d had to drink the night before.</p><p>\u201cCharming,\u201d he heard Julian comment after a few seconds of gagging with his head in the toilet.</p><p>It was going to be a long day.</p><p>Rather than piling into the Range Rover and driving to the cemetery, Nick suggested they walk it. It was a glorious day, full of sunshine and birds singing and a nice cool breeze.</p><p>Kelly had to stop occasionally, apparently to make sure he didn\u2019t hurl again, and Nick did his best not to laugh at his lover\u2019s misery. He distinctly remembered trying to discourage the last two rounds. He slipped his arm around Kelly\u2019s shoulders, patting him in the same way he\u2019d done a hundred times before when they were suffering through a morning after.</p><p>The fact that they\u2019d started fucking after almost fifteen years of knowing each other hadn\u2019t changed many of their habits.</p><p>\u201cI hate you,\u201d Kelly groaned.</p><p>\u201cPoor Boo Boo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate your high tolerance,\u201d Kelly groused. \u201cI hate that I can\u2019t drink you under the table or knock you out with normal drugs \u2019cause your stupid body is immune to chemicals. I hate that when I try I wind up in a ditch in Mexico.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere there,\u201d Nick cooed.</p><p>\u201cI hate you so much.\u201d Kelly\u2019s hand in his back pocket as they walked told a different story, though.</p><p>They headed for Boston Commons, which was a nice easy stroll from the Liberty, and from there Nick explained that the city had created a red brick line through the old town that led tourists along the Freedom Trail. It was a nice easy walk that took people from historic spot to historic spot, all related to the American Revolution. They picked up the red trail and followed it toward the Granary Burying Ground.</p><p>The morning sun hadn\u2019t yet risen over the buildings around them, casting the cemetery in a gloomy haze. Nick led the way through the gate, glancing around at the crooked headstones with their macabre carvings. It was an odd little lot. It included the graves of Revolutionary heroes, including Sam Adams and Paul Revere. In the center was a massive monument dedicated to Ben Franklin\u2019s family. The buildings that had cropped up around the old burial ground had come so close to the boundaries that their brick walls incorporated headstones into them. Many of the headstones that had once been here had been removed and used as sidewalks, and there were estimates that hundreds of bodies still remained beneath the ground, unmarked and lost to history.</p><p>What remained was a mixture of veneration of the past and compromise toward the future. Nick had always felt a little uneasy when he\u2019d visited this place.</p><p>\u201cThe headstones are . . . irreverent, to say the least,\u201d JD commented. He was kneeling in front of one. Many of them had skulls grinning impishly, with wings behind them. Nick has seen a few with dancing skeletons, capering around as death chased after them.</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d Julian asked. \u201cWhat now? Is the treasure supposed to be buried here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt couldn\u2019t possibly be,\u201d JD answered. \u201cNot if the stories surrounding its theft are true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s another marker here somewhere,\u201d Nick added.</p><p>\u201cAre you fucking telling me we came out here before the fucking sun for another clue to where this treasure is and not the treasure itself?\u201d Kelly asked. He had Nick\u2019s aviators on despite the lack of light.</p><p>\u201cIt makes sense; if he was leaving clues behind for someone to follow to this treasure, he would have done it on permanent fixtures. Or, things they would have considered permanent then. Graveyards, churches, buildings of importance he had to trust wouldn\u2019t be torn down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you believe we\u2019re looking for a gravestone,\u201d Julian said.Nick nodded. \u201cThe date of death would be 1775.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Julian asked.</p><p>\u201cA clue carved on a tombstone would have been left as soon as it could be commissioned, when they still had access to the city,\u201d Nick explained. \u201cHad to be that year because they evacuated shortly after.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else?\u201d Julian asked.</p><p>Nick shrugged and dug in the pocket of his jeans for the napkin JD had left on the table last night. \u201cNo clue. That\u2019s where JD\u2019s diamonds come in.\u201d</p><p>JD took a deep breath to steady himself and stepped closer to take the napkin. Nick touched his arm gently.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Nick offered.</p><p>JD held his gaze for a few seconds, then nodded and gave him a weak smile. \u201cI tried putting myself in your shoes last night, when I went to bed. I get it. I wouldn\u2019t trust me either.\u201d</p><p>Nick cocked his head, raising both eyebrows in surprise.</p><p>\u201cI do trust you. I\u2019m sorry for making you feel like I didn\u2019t.</p><p>And I made you a promise. I intend to keep it. Let\u2019s do this.\u201d</p><p>JD squared his shoulders. \u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>Kelly groaned off in the distance. Nick glanced around for him and found him sitting on the steps that led down to the sidewalk, resting his head against an iron fence. He was pretty hungover, but the last historic graveyard Kelly had been in had almost killed him. Nick couldn\u2019t help the shiver that ran up his spine with the memory.</p><p>\u201cHey, babe, you alright?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate you!\u201d Kelly called back.</p><p>\u201cOkay, well . . . keep lookout for us then,\u201d Nick said, his voice shaking with laughter.</p><p>He turned, and Julian fell in step beside him. The man was actually smiling. \u201cOne night, Detective, you and I will sit and have a drink just so I can say I survived it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Nick laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s a date.\u201d</p><p>They split off, each of them wandering the crooked lanes of the graveyard, examining each headstone for any sort of clue. They didn\u2019t know what they were searching for, though, and it was a large graveyard.</p><p>Nick kept glancing back to the steps, where JD now sat beside Kelly, his head bent over the napkin. Kelly was still leaning against the iron gate.</p> <p>\u201cWhat if it\u2019s a grid?\u201d JD called.</p><p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d Kelly grunted. He covered the ear JD had just shouted into. \u201cDude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d JD offered with a wince.</p><p>\u201cA grid,\u201d Nick repeated, drawing closer to them.</p><p>JD nodded and stood. \u201cIf you turn it on its point, with the X forming a cross-like grid instead, then the symbols start to make a little bit of sense. Look.\u201d</p> <p>Nick stood at JD\u2019s shoulder, eyes going from the napkin to the graveyard. JD was right. One of the symbols that had looked like a less-than symbol now appeared to represent the obelisk monument of the Franklin family in the center of the burial ground. Another, which Nick had assumed was an infinity mark, appeared to represent a barrel-vaulted tomb near the edge of the ground.</p><p>\u201cNice,\u201d he said with a pat on JD\u2019s back.</p><p>JD was grinning, looking pleased with himself. \u201cIt\u2019s a legit map. I mean, we have to take into account that I freehand drew it from memory, so it might be iffy on exact locations.</p><p>But stil .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are we looking for, then?\u201d Kelly asked. He still sounded miserable, but he was up and peeking over JD\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cIs there an X on it?\u201d Julian asked, his voice laced with sarcasm. \u201cAn X would make this easy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. But there is a cross,\u201d JD told him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a cemetery,\u201d Julian grunted. \u201cThere are crosses everywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe treasure he buried was a cross,\u201d Nick pointed out.</p><p>\u201cWhat better to mark it with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you thinking the treasure itself is buried here?\u201d</p><p>Kelly asked again. \u201c\u2019Cause I don\u2019t have my grave-desecrating boots on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, this is just another hint. The treasure would have to be northwest, somewhere along Battle Road,\u201d Nick guessed.</p><p>Julian pulled up short. \u201cHow do you know that? And why the fuck are we here rather than there?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe wagon was intercepted on the road to Concord and Lexington,\u201d Nick told him. \u201cIt had to be hidden before it reached the checkpoint at Boston. See, at the time, Boston was a peninsula; there was only one way in by land. The British troops occupied the city, but the Colonial troops controlled the countryside. They had a gentleman\u2019s agreement to allow passage to and from the city as long the traveler was unarmed.</p><p>A stolen wagon full of gold being driven like hell by British soldiers wasn\u2019t going to be making the cut. They would have had to have hidden it between Lexington and here.\u201d</p><p>Julian frowned. \u201cFair enough.\u201d</p><p>JD was watching Nick, his blue eyes unreadable.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Nick asked.</p><p>\u201cYou know a hell of a lot more about this than you let on.\u201d</p><p>Nick\u2019s only response was an unapologetic shrug.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the cross on the goddamned napkin? Let\u2019s get this shit over with,\u201d Kelly mumbled.</p><p>JD held it up, positioning the two main landmarks appropriately. Nick pointed to the cross on the napkin, and they all turned toward the spot in the graveyard it indicated.</p><p>Julian glanced toward the sidewalk as Nick and the others moved forward. \u201cI\u2019ll hold down the fort,\u201d he offered. \u201cI\u2019m not very good at this stuff anyway.\u201d</p><p>Nick stopped and looked back at him. Julian cocked his head almost imperceptibly, and Nick\u2019s eyes strayed toward the perimeter. A city cab sat idling on the other side of the street, just out of sight unless you stood near the cemetery gate to see beyond the buildings on either side.</p><p>Nick nodded. Julian had picked up on their tail before Nick had. That was a little spooky, but Nick tried to shrug it off and trust the man to have his six as he headed for the indicated section of the graveyard.</p><p>JD and Kelly were wandering around the graves, bending occasionally to examine a headstone or wipe at the words to better read them.</p><p>\u201cI think I got something,\u201d Kelly said quietly. Nick came up behind where he was kneeling. The carvings on the marker had been nearly obscured by hundreds of years of weathering, which was odd since most of them had held up reasonably well. But the date was still clearly visible. There was no date of birth, merely the date of death: April 19, 1775.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s weird,\u201d JD whispered.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the day of the Battles of Lexington and Concord,\u201d Nick told them.</p><p>\u201cCould it be a soldier who was killed there?\u201d Kelly asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a body,\u201d JD said. \u201cThe marker was placed here as a clue to the location of the stolen loot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould explain why there\u2019s no date of birth, and why the carving isn\u2019t as deep: it was done in a hurry or on the sly,\u201d Nick added. \u201cThis must have been the only way the soldiers could tell what they\u2019d done, leaving a monument to the theft, a map pointing the way.\u201d</p><p>Kelly fished his phone out of his pocket, then took a picture of the gravestone.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Nick asked.</p><p>\u201cBeing awesome, how about you?\u201d Kelly drawled. He pulled up the shot he\u2019d just taken in his photo app and began to play with the contrast, adding to the shadows, brightening the lighter bits. Soon he had a representation of what the marker probably read. He stood and showed it to Nick.</p><p>Nick grinned and nodded. \u201cBeing awesome indeed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s it say?\u201d JD asked, and they crowded around the phone.</p><p>\u201cRussell B. North,\u201d Kelly read. \u201cIs that significant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to me,\u201d Nick admitted.</p><p>\u201cNorth,\u201d JD said with a wave of his hand. \u201cAnd the Battles of Lexington and Concord. The Old North Bridge. It was where the first shot of the war was fired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow would he have gotten back there to leave something?\u201d Nick argued.</p><p>\u201cHe obviously stuck around Boston long enough to commission a fucking headstone be carved. That would have been what, at least a week? A few days? Time for him to range out of Boston while it was being done. A single man traveling out of the city with no weapons would have had free passage, you said so yourself. Maybe the treasure itself was hidden there.\u201d</p><p>Kelly and Nick shared a look, and Kelly nodded. \u201cSounds good to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Let\u2019s rol .\u201d</p><p>They rejoined Julian as he loitered near the entrance.</p><p>\u201cFind it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe think so. How are our friends?\u201d Nick asked. He carefully positioned himself between the cab and JD, just in case.Julian grunted. \u201cNosy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould we deter them?\u201d Kelly asked.</p><p>Nick stared at the cab for a few moments. He wanted their tail to know they\u2019d been spotted. \u201cNo,\u201d he finally growled.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll lose them on Battle Road. If they can keep up, they\u2019re welcome to come and get us.\u201d</p><p>Kelly had commandeered Nick\u2019s spare set of sunglasses in the car and was nursing a cup of the strongest coffee he\u2019d been able to buy on the walk back to the hotel. He was slumped in the front seat, trying not to watch the scenery pass by.</p><p>He felt a million times better than he had when he\u2019d woken, but he\u2019d much rather be in bed on Nick\u2019s boat being cuddled than here right now.</p><p>\u201cDoing okay?\u201d Nick asked him. He\u2019d stopped sounding amused, and his voice was laced with more concern every time he asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine,\u201d Kelly grunted. \u201cDon\u2019t look at me. Stop looking at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForgive my ignorance of this particular war, but what is the importance of this bridge we\u2019re going to see?\u201d Julian asked.</p><p>\u201cThe North Bridge was part of the Battle of Concord,\u201d Nick answered. \u201cFour-hundred minutemen and Colonial militia against just under a hundred British regulars. It was the first battle of the war, the opening bell that told the British the Americans were going to put up real resistance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d Julian said.</p><p>Nick handed his phone to Kelly. \u201cCall Hagan for me, will you? I told him we might have to go off grid last night, but he\u2019ll call out the cavalry if I don\u2019t check in.\u201d</p><p>Kelly pushed Nick\u2019s aviators down his nose and flipped through Nick\u2019s recently dialed numbers. He paused when he saw that Nick had called Ty Grady several nights ago. He glanced at Nick in surprise. Nick hadn\u2019t spoken to Ty about anything that didn\u2019t have to do with work since they\u2019d come home from Scotland.</p><p>\u201cYou talked to Ty?\u201d Kelly asked.</p><p>Nick glanced at him, then again before returning his attention to the road. \u201cYeah, he called to check up on us. I called him back, he pegged JD\u2019s accent for us. Why?\u201d</p><p>Kelly shrugged. \u201cIf you two are on speaking terms again, he\u2019d be a good one to call in for this shit, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre we talking about Tyler?\u201d Julian asked, leaning forward to put his face between the two of them from the backseat. \u201cPlease do call him, I have missed being handcuffed to every possible surface whenever I speak.\u201d</p><p>Nick glanced at him in the rearview mirror, smiling slightly. Then he tapped Kelly\u2019s knee and shook his head. \u201cWe got this. Call Hagan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Kelly found Hagan\u2019s number and dialed, then handed the phone to Nick. He watched him, though, his hangover forgotten. Ty and Nick had known each other since they were both seventeen years old. To think that their friendship was crumbling, or worse, coming to an end, made Kelly immeasurably sad. It was like losing a family member.</p><p>\u201cHagan. Yeah, I\u2019m sorry, I should have checked in last night. I know.\u201d Nick glanced at Kelly and rolled his eyes. \u201cWe got distracted. Anyway listen, we\u2019re on our way to Concord.\u201d</p><p>Kelly returned his attention to the passing scenery as Nick filled Hagan in. He shifted around, trying to get comfortable. He wasn\u2019t sure what Nick had done to him last night, but he hoped he would do it again when Kelly could remember the specifics of how he\u2019d gotten so fucking sore. It was probably fun.</p><p>It was about a thirty-minute drive to the bridge, and Kelly was surprised when they arrived to find a visitor\u2019s center, loads of tourists, and stone monuments commemorating the battle.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a national park?\u201d Kelly asked when he joined Nick at the bumper of the Range Rover. He\u2019d expected a little parking lot next to a creek with a bridge over it. But there were monuments and walkways and visitor centers and tour bus parking. He couldn\u2019t even see the river, much less the bridge.</p><p>Nick leaned against it, his arms crossed. \u201cAnd it\u2019s the first Sunday of summer.\u201d</p><p>Julian was pacing, eyeing the crowds like they might be filled with hidden assassins gunning for him. Kelly would have been amused by it, but he had to acknowledge that it might actually be true.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s our plan?\u201d JD asked them.</p><p>Nick pursed his lips, his expression mostly hidden behind his sunglasses. He lowered his head. Kelly glanced from him to JD with a wince, then looked over to Julian, who simply shrugged.</p><p>\u201cDo we have a plan?\u201d JD asked, sounding a little more agitated.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the treasure hunter,\u201d Nick told him.</p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019m not a hound dog who\u2019ll point on command, all right? I don\u2019t remember any of my fucking training.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s do a recon of the bridge,\u201d Kelly suggested. \u201cIf he carved a message in it, it\u2019s got to be somewhere accessible, but hidden enough to escape notice all these years. Can\u2019t be too many places like that on a bridge in the middle of all these tourists.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll split up along the scenic paths,\u201d Nick agreed.</p><p>\u201cApproach it from each side. Kels, you and Cross circle around the north end, JD and I will take the south. We\u2019ll meet you at the bridge\u2019s head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Kelly patted Julian on the shoulder and they headed off together as Nick and JD went the other way.</p><p>\u201cCan I ask you a personal question?\u201d Julian asked almost as soon as they were out of earshot of the others.</p><p>\u201cI guess, sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it bother you that he orders you around like he does?\u201d</p><p>Kelly\u2019s head jerked up. \u201cNo,\u201d he answered. \u201cIf we were making breakfast or going to a movie, he\u2019d be asking for opinions left and right. This is a tactical situation, though, and he\u2019s reverting to his training. If he hadn\u2019t, I\u2019d be worried about him.\u201d</p><p>Julian arched an eyebrow as they walked along the paved path.Kelly just shrugged. \u201cPeople see Nick in all kinds of ways.\u201d</p><p>He smiled fondly. \u201cHe\u2019s so much more than you see on the surface, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you say so.\u201d Julian returned his attention to the crowd as they meandered along the path, trying to blend with the tourists.</p><p>Kelly briefly let his mind wander to Nick before he did the same. He didn\u2019t care if he was the only one who saw through all Nick\u2019s layers. He knew the man who\u2019d hold the hand of a dying enemy, who would let a kid tie a piece of yarn around his wrist for luck and still be wearing it five years later, who would lay his head in Kelly\u2019s lap and sigh as if he\u2019d just dropped a huge weight from his shoulders. He was the man who would never, ever make a promise unless he intended to keep it or bleed trying.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s the bridge,\u201d Julian said, pul ing Kelly out of his reverie.</p><p>Ahead of them was a large stone monument, rising over the bank of the river. A concrete path led around it toward an arched wooden bridge. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s wood,\u201d Kelly blurted.</p><p>He and Julian shared an uneasy glance. \u201cThere are covered bridges in the area that are over two hundred years old, right?\u201d Julian asked. \u201cIt could have survived, being an important landmark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess . . .\u201d</p> <p>They loitered near the monument until Nick and JD came into sight. JD was talking animatedly, and Nick had his head down as he walked. Kelly could tell he was staying aware of his surroundings by the tension in his shoulders, but he also looked irritated.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Kelly asked as soon as they approached.</p><p>Nick just looked away and shook his head.</p><p>\u201cThe bridge is a reproduction,\u201d JD told them. \u201cIt\u2019s been rebuilt three times since the Battle of Concord.\u201d</p><p>Kelly swiped his hand over his mouth. \u201cWell fuck.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPerhaps it wasn\u2019t on the bridge itself; perhaps it was carved somewhere near,\u201d Julian tried. \u201cThe bank of this river is littered with large boulders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d JD nodded, eyes sparkling. \u201cI was telling Nick, we passed a sign for something called Egg Rock, apparently it\u2019s a big deal. The city even carved a memorial into it. It can\u2019t be the only one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are we supposed to do, inspect every rock on the riverbank?\u201d Nick snapped.</p><p>\u201cWe can try the area around the bridge, at least.\u201d Julian sounded almost desperate. He took a step toward Nick, one hand up. \u201cWe\u2019ve come all this way.\u201d</p><p>Nick met Kelly\u2019s eyes briefly. He seemed at his wit\u2019s end with this. Kelly knew it was frustrating for Nick to fail, especially when lives hung in the balance. But it wasn\u2019t his boyfriend who was being held prisoner, and Julian was asking for nothing but a little more patience. So they headed for the bridge as a brisk wind plucked at their jackets and ruffled Kelly\u2019s hair.</p><p>Nick stepped onto the wooden bridge and peered over the edge. It was made entirely of wood, but the ends were built into rock walls. Spring had brought a lot of rain, and the river was swollen with it. To see the faces of the stones, they would have to get wet. He gestured to Julian. \u201cYou two check the other end.\u201d</p> <p>Julian and JD headed across the bridge, their footsteps echoing on the planks. It was a peaceful day, filled with the sounds of birds chirping, groups of chattering tourists, and the babbling of the water as it flowed beneath them. Kelly was kind of enjoying this.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s going in the water?\u201d Nick asked Kelly.</p><p>Kelly held up his fist. Nick mimicked him, and they counted off. Kelly threw paper, then laughed as he covered Nick\u2019s fist with his hand. \u201cAlways the rock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich makes me wonder why you throw scissors half the time.\u201d</p><p>Kelly grinned impishly. \u201cDepends on the punishment.</p><p>Sometimes I like to lose.\u201d</p><p>Nick narrowed his eyes. \u201cNext time I\u2019m taking vacation days and we\u2019re never wearing pants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeal.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHelp me out here,\u201d Nick grumbled as he shrugged out of his leather coat. Kelly took it and slung it over the railing.</p><p>Nick swung around the end of the bridge and edged his way down the steep bank. The ground was mushy and oversaturated; Nick\u2019s boots made deep furrows in the mud, and he reached up to grip the wooden boards of the bridge.</p><p>Kelly laid himself out and slipped his arm under the railing, his hand hanging down so Nick could grab for it if he started to slip further.</p><p>Nick held on to the bridge as he examined the wall of rocks. Every couple minutes he would bend and wipe away dirt or pull moss from one of the rocks, his movements growing jerkier and more frustrated the longer he searched.</p><p>Finally he was low enough that the water was lapping at his boots.</p><p>\u201cSee anything?\u201d Kelly asked after a few moments.</p><p>Nick glared up at him, his eyes flashing. He gave a single jerk of his head in answer. Kelly heard footsteps on the bridge, then felt them in his chest. He twisted to see JD and Julian walking back toward them. JD was wet up to his chest.</p><p>\u201cYou can see the original pilings,\u201d JD called down to Nick.</p><p>\u201cYou got to get wet, Detective.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t get paid enough for this,\u201d Nick griped. He grasped Kelly\u2019s hand and slid further down like he was surfing a wave.</p><p>Then he was in the water. He moved beneath the bridge, his fingers slipping out of Kelly\u2019s grasp and finally moving out of Kelly\u2019s sight.</p><p>JD and Julian both leaned over the railing, trying to see him. Kelly stayed where he was, though, his hand still hanging down. Nick was moving upstream, so if he lost his footing and the water took him, he could at least try to make a grab for Kelly\u2019s hand as he went by.</p><p>\u201cFucking morons,\u201d Nick shouted after several more minutes of silent searching. \u201cWho writes a goddamn message on a wooden bridge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh boy,\u201d Kelly muttered. He pushed to his knees and headed to the end of the bridge, stepping out onto the rocks so he could see where Nick was. He was standing in waist- deep water, one hand gripping the piling of the bridge, one hand on a rock in front of him.</p><p>\u201cIn the middle of a fucking war, where bridges were literally being burned!\u201d Nick shouted.</p><p>Kelly beckoned with his fingers. \u201cCome out of the water, bud.\u201d\u201cHe had to know wood wouldn\u2019t stick around!\u201d Nick shouted. \u201cFucking idiot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere there,\u201d Kelly said.</p><p>\u201cThis shit was gone by the time they put that message in the diamonds,\u201d Nick railed. \u201cWhat was the point? It\u2019s a fucking dead end!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBabe, come on, get out of the water,\u201d Kelly tried again.</p><p>\u201cWe have a problem,\u201d Julian said.</p><p>Kelly glanced up at him, then followed the direction of Julian\u2019s gaze. A couple was strol ing toward them. The woman had a mop of wavy auburn hair, almost the same color as Nick\u2019s, and she was quite striking. High cheekbones, full lips that curved into a smirk. Kelly looked her up and down out of habit. The man was considerably less attractive, with a hard edge to his eyes and a scar that went from one of his heavy eyebrows to his rather square chin. They definitely didn\u2019t look like they fit as a couple.</p><p>Julian positioned himself in front of JD.</p><p>Kelly watched their approach, the gun on his belt feeling heavier as they came closer. He gave Nick a quick look over his shoulder, but Nick was gone. The water flowed peacefully over the spot where he\u2019d been. Kelly stood, making certain his jacket covered his gun. He didn\u2019t have time to get back up to the bridge, but at least this way they were offering two separate targets.</p><p>\u201cGood afternoon, gents,\u201d the man called in a genial Irish accent.</p><p>\u201cHello, Dr. Hunt,\u201d the woman added with a kind smile. \u201cI hear you\u2019re having a rough few days.\u201d</p><p>JD took a tiny step sideways so he could see them over Julian\u2019s shoulder. He was smart enough to stay behind Julian, though.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the detective?\u201d the woman asked.</p><p>Kelly and Julian shared a glance, then Kelly looked over his shoulder into the water.</p><p>\u201cOh my,\u201d the woman cooed. \u201cI do hope he can swim. My name is Alex Kincade. And I understand we\u2019re all searching for the same thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomehow I doubt that,\u201d Kelly challenged.</p><p>\u201cDoubt all you like, it\u2019s true. The Golden and Rosy Cross.</p><p>You\u2019re quite the resourceful little group; we\u2019d like to combine forces.\u201d</p><p>Kelly grinned when he saw movement behind the pair.</p><p>\u201cGood luck with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHands up,\u201d Nick said as he stepped behind them, his gun out. He was dripping from head to toe, his curly hair plastered to his head. \u201cOn your knees, both of you. You\u2019re under arrest.\u201d</p><p>Nick only had one pair of handcuffs on him. He pestered Julian until the man rolled his eyes and provided a handful of white zip ties from one of the pockets of his jacket.</p><p>\u201cWhere do you keep all that stuff?\u201d Kelly asked.</p><p>\u201cDoc, help me,\u201d Nick grunted. He yanked the woman\u2019s hands behind her back and tightened the zip tie. \u201cYou have the right to remain silent,\u201d he said against her ear. \u201cProfessor Singleton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, you know her?\u201d Kelly blurted. He had the man restrained and on his knees. Both suspects were staying quiet.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s the one I spoke to on the phone. Told me who JD was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJD,\u201d she said, her voice like smooth honey. It was even nicer in person than it had been on the phone. \u201cLike John Doe. That\u2019s cute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou teach pop culture archaeology huh? Nice cover.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI try,\u201d she said with a shrug.</p><p>JD stalked toward her, and Nick put a hand out to keep him from getting close enough for her to hurt him. \u201cHow do you know who I am?\u201d JD demanded.</p><p>\u201cYou really don\u2019t remember anything?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cAnswer the question,\u201d Nick growled. He poked her hard in the back.</p><p>Alex cleared her throat. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to court me, Detective, I like roses. Red ones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know who I am!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were colleagues, Casey,\u201d Alex said with a hint of injury in her tone. \u201cWe find lost works of art and liberate them from their prisons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Kelly drawled. \u201cThat\u2019s the fanciest \u2018I steal things\u2019 I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201d</p><p>Nick hummed in agreement.</p><p>The woman laughed. \u201cI imagine you think it\u2019s along the same lines as Mr. Cross\u2019s \u2018I deal antiques\u2019 in reference to cold-blooded murder.\u201d</p><p>Julian\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cYou know me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know of you. I was warned you\u2019d be out here.\u201d</p><p>Nick recognized the signs of Julian coiling to attack, but there was no way he could get to him in time to keep it from happening. He wrapped an arm around Alex and turned her, instead, putting himself between her and Julian. Kelly intercepted Julian as he launched himself at them, wrapping him up and trying to talk him into being calm.</p><p>\u201cThey have him!\u201d Julian snarled. Kelly had his hands full trying to restrain him.</p><p>JD edged away from them, a hint of a wild animal in his eyes, which were darting from Julian to Nick and back.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s them, they took him!\u201d Julian railed.</p><p>They were drawing way too much notice from the crowds of tourists. Nick tucked his sopping wet shirt in under the badge on his belt so it would be visible.</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t take anyone,\u201d Alex insisted. She looked over her shoulder, and Nick turned a little so he could see Julian.</p><p>Kelly had him in a headlock, but he was trying not to hurt him so they were both struggling. \u201cGood Lord,\u201d Alex said quietly. \u201cYou have a leash for him, right?\u201d</p><p>Nick tightened the zip tie, and Alex winced. \u201cWhat was your endgame here, huh?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou followed us hoping we\u2019d lead you to the treasure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty much, yeah. When the clues led you here, though, I realized you were as stuck as we are. This isn\u2019t the right place.\u201d</p><p>Nick\u2019s brow furrowed, and he glanced again at the others.</p><p>Alex\u2019s Irish henchman was standing calmly aside, his hands tied behind his back, watching. He hadn\u2019t tried to make a run for it. Julian was on his knees, head hanging, chest heaving.</p><p>Kelly stood over him, a hand on his back, murmuring words to calm him.</p><p>Nick wiped his wrist over his forehead to stop the water from dripping in his eyes. As soon as he\u2019d heard Julian give his warning on the bridge, he\u2019d sunk below the ripples and let the current take him downstream, then doubled back to get the drop on their unexpected company.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said almost to himself. \u201cOkay. Hold on.\u201d</p><p>Julian glared at him, seething.</p><p>Nick turned Alex again, making her stumble as he forced her to face the others. \u201cTell us a story, Professor,\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cFrom the beginning.\u201d</p><p>Alex cleared her throat. \u201cYou seem like a CliffsNotes crowd.\u201d</p><p>Kelly stood and shook out his shoulders. He helped Julian to his feet. JD came closer.</p><p>\u201cOkay, let\u2019s start with the basics. Do you know who the Rosicrucians were?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSecret society precursor to the Masons,\u201d Kelly grunted.</p><p>\u201cThey were esoteric, focused their efforts on nature, healing, and chemistry,\u201d Nick added.</p><p>\u201cImpressive. They are rumored to have made incredible breakthroughs, including gaining mastery in alchemy and, most famously, creating the philosopher\u2019s stone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike Harry Potter?\u201d Kelly asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Alex said, her voice cold. \u201cNot like Harry Potter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet to the point a little faster,\u201d Nick urged.</p><p>\u201cThe point is, those are myths and legends, but the reality behind them is true. The Rosicrucians made valuable advances with their equations and formulas. They could cure illnesses in the Middle Ages we could only hope to fight against today.</p><p>There are even contemporary sources that imply they were able to cure cancer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Rosicrucians had a cure for cancer?\u201d JD asked. He\u2019d pulled to his true height as Alex spoke, a look of recognition dawning on his face. He winced and smacked his forehead.</p><p>\u201cThey wrote the formulas on gold scrolls to keep them from being destroyed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Alex said. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t lost all that knowledge up there after al .\u201d</p><p>\u201cGolden scrolls?\u201d Nick repeated.</p><p>\u201cWhen the Masons rose to power, they sought to protect that knowledge. They were at war with the Catholic Church, who was in the midst of a power grab. The Pope decreed everything the Rosicrucians had discovered was magic, of the devil, all that crap. The burgeoning Masonic powers couldn\u2019t risk the Church obtaining the scrolls and melting them down. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>All that knowledge, lost . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get it,\u201d Kelly said suddenly. \u201cThe cross is made of layers of gold. It\u2019s wrapped in the scrolls, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it is.\u201d Alex was solemn. \u201cThey knew the Church would never desecrate a cross. The scrolls would be safe until . . . well, I guess until more enlightened minds could discover them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEnlightened minds like yourself?\u201d Nick asked.</p><p>Alex rolled her eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t pretend you\u2019re after that treasure for altruistic reasons. Please. Dr. Hunt and I were hired by Alco Pharmaceuticals. We\u2019re supposed to find the ancient formulas.\u201d</p><p>Julian scoffed at her. \u201cA pharmaceutical company hired treasure hunters?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCancer is big money,\u201d Alex stated almost sadly.</p><p>Nick loosened his hold on her arm. \u201cWhy\u2019d you pretend to be a professor at Boston College to give me an ID? Why not just come in and claim JD?\u201d</p> <p>Alex met JD\u2019s eyes. \u201cBecause he ran out on us. One night we figured out that the trail led us to Massachusetts, and we finished a bottle of wine in celebration. The next morning, he was gone. I thought he was after the treasure for a rival company, so I had to follow him quietly.\u201d</p><p>JD met Nick\u2019s eyes. He was breathing hard, realization sweeping over his face. \u201cOh my God,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cJD . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all true then,\u201d JD cried. \u201cI am a bad guy! I\u2019m a murderer and a thief and . . . and maybe a kidnapper! And I betrayed people who were supposed to be my friends and colleagues! You even said you trusted me! Jesus!\u201d</p><p>He ran both hands through his hair and turned away to pace.</p><p>\u201cHow did he get murderer and thief from what I just said?\u201d Alex asked Nick.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a long story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you untie us now?\u201d</p><p>Nick took his knife from his belt and sliced through the zip tie. Kelly followed his lead and released the man, whose name ended up being Colin.</p><p>Alex rubbed at her wrists, eyes on Julian. \u201cThe man who hired us told us you\u2019d be out there too. He said you were dangerous and motivated. That\u2019s why we bring Colin along everywhere.\u201d</p><p>Colin gave a silent nod.</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t know anyone had been kidnapped,\u201d Alex said.</p><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy husband,\u201d Julian said through gritted teeth. \u201cI was told to give them the location of the cross and they wouldn\u2019t harm him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYour husband?\u201d Nick blurted. Julian nodded.</p><p>\u201cCongratulations,\u201d Nick offered lamely.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t found the cross?\u201d Alex asked.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t been looking for it. I\u2019ve been looking for them.</p><p>Who are they?\u201d</p><p>Alex\u2019s eyes went wide. \u201cI don\u2019t know. We were told rival companies were after the cross and we\u2019d have to move fast.\u201d</p><p>Kelly stepped forward, close to Nick, and he lowered his voice when he spoke. \u201cSo we have three parties in play here? Alex\u2019s group, JD\u2019s group, and Julian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m taking away from all this,\u201d Nick answered. He reached to his belt, pul ing his handcuffs from their holster. \u201cOne thing I do know . . .\u201d</p><p>Kelly nodded. \u201cEvidence is saying you have to arrest him, huh?\u201d</p><p>Nick sighed. JD turned and halted his pacing when he saw Nick watching him. The look in his eyes was one of both resignation and betrayal. \u201cYou\u2019re really going to arrest me now?\u201d</p><p>Nick held up the handcuffs and moved closer to him.</p><p>\u201cTurn around,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>JD lowered his head and turned his back to Nick, his shoulders slumping. Nick took one wrist in his hand, but before he could put the handcuffs on him, JD jerked his elbow.</p><p>He landed a blow on Nick\u2019s side, and Nick\u2019s knees buckled.</p><p>JD whirled and grabbed Nick\u2019s gun from its holster as Nick went to the ground, and his hands were trembling. He backed away, the gun pointing from one person to the next.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said to Nick. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I hurt you. But I can\u2019t let you arrest me, not yet. I have to find them and find out the truth first.\u201d</p><p>Nick braced a hand on the concrete walkway, gasping and wincing as his blazing eyes tracked JD, who was still backing away from them al .</p><p>JD\u2019s eyes darted around the hordes of tourists, and then he pointed the gun in the air, aiming it in the general direction of the river. The blast of the shot echoed off the rol ing hills and stone monuments and created instant panic: tour groups screamed and scattered, families with children flattened to the ground, kayakers on the river dove out of their vessels into the water for safety.</p><p>JD met Nick\u2019s eyes one last time as he moved away. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ll turn myself in after, I promise!\u201d he called, and then he bolted into the crowd.</p><p>Chapter 9</p><p>elly loitered near the park ranger\u2019s office, listening as KNick gave a report to someone on the phone. From the tone of his voice, he wasn\u2019t enjoying the conversation.</p><p>When he was done, he emerged from the office and gave everyone a grim smile.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d it go?\u201d Julian asked.</p><p>Nick laughed bitterly. \u201cWell. I brought a suspect to a public place while I was supposed to be on guard duty, lost control of my department-issued sidearm, and then allowed the suspect to abscond with it into a crowd. Oh, and fire it.</p><p>Apparently it hit a goose downriver.\u201d</p><p>They all stared at him, wide-eyed and waiting for him to continue. \u201cLet\u2019s just say it didn\u2019t go too well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you been shelved?\u201d Kelly asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019ve been given forty-eight hours to fix it.\u201d</p><p>Alex had been keeping her distance, but she was edging closer. \u201cYou know the only way to find where he\u2019s going is to find the treasure, right?\u201d</p><p>Nick narrowed his eyes at her. \u201cThank you for at least being transparent in your motives.\u201d</p><p>Alex shrugged. \u201cWhat do you say, Detective? You want to work together in this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Nick growled. He headed for the door, and Kelly fell into step beside him.</p><p>They reached the door, and Kelly glanced back to find Julian hadn\u2019t moved. He tugged on Nick\u2019s damp shirt, and Nick turned as well.</p><p>\u201cYou jumping ship?\u201d Kelly asked Julian.</p><p>Julian smiled softly. \u201cI have to find Cameron.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood luck to you,\u201d Nick told him. \u201cYou have my number if you need it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you will have mine.\u201d</p><p>Nick turned and left the office without another word.</p><p>Kelly gave Julian a small wave before following his lover out.</p><p>\u201cWe going after the treasure?\u201d Kelly asked as Nick stalked toward his Range Rover.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Nick said through gritted teeth. \u201cWe are going after my fugitive.\u201d</p><p>He opened up the back of the SUV and rummaged around for a duffel bag he kept there. Kelly leaned against the car as Nick pulled out a fresh pair of clothing and began to change, right there in the middle of the parking lot.</p><p>Kelly pursed his lips, leering when Nick took his shirt off.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re staring like a pervert,\u201d Nick said without looking over at him.</p><p>\u201cSo is everyone else in the parking lot,\u201d Kelly shot back.</p><p>\u201cYou should put on dry boxers too. You know. For your health.\u201d</p><p>Nick glanced around the lot, then glared at Kelly.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Irish. You did everything right, here. You were careful and he still burned you. No way to see it coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. Don\u2019t have to bend over and enjoy getting played, though.\u201d</p><p>Once Nick had gotten dry clothes on, they climbed into the Range Rover, but Nick didn\u2019t start the car.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Kelly asked him.</p><p>\u201cI just . . . if this was a dead end, what was the point? The plaque we saw on the way there said the original bridge had been dismantled in 1793. Why the hell would you create a clue in 1831 that led to something you knew was gone?\u201d</p><p>Kelly nodded, resting his head on the seat. \u201cMaybe we had the clue wrong?\u201d Nick\u2019s green eyes sparkled. \u201cMaybe it didn\u2019t lead us here. I mean, why should it? The treasure was stolen at a tavern between here and Boston. The British were retreating to Boston. They wouldn\u2019t have come back here with the treasure; it\u2019d be hidden between the original theft and the city. So why put a clue that brings you past the treasure? It was a long way by horseback, why all the wasted mileage?\u201d</p><p>Nick was nodding as Kelly spoke, his eyes going unfocused.</p><p>\u201cWhat was the whole name on the gravestone?\u201d Kelly asked.</p><p>\u201cRussell,\u201d Nick answered. \u201cRussell B. North.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe took North as the clue, but what if it\u2019s just the direction we were supposed to head in? Or nothing at al ?\u201d</p><p>Kelly mused. \u201cIs the name Russell important? Is it a town or something?\u201d</p><p>Nick sighed heavily and shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know.</p><p>Get your phone out, look it up. I\u2019m going to call Hagan, see if he\u2019s come up with anything in those letters.\u201d</p><p>Kelly did a few searches on his phone, trying to combine the words Russell and Revolutionary War with Lexington and Concord. He got results for several soldiers and historians, but one result popped up over and over. \u201cThink I got something,\u201d he told Nick.</p><p>Nick had his phone to his ear, but he raised both eyebrows at Kelly. He put the phone on speaker and lowered it to his lap. He was apparently on hold.</p><p>\u201cThe Jason Russell house?\u201d Kelly said. \u201cThis says it was the bloodiest part of the Battles of Lexington and Concord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was in a town called Menotomy. Where is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what the town of Arlington used to be called,\u201d Nick said as he stuck the keys in the ignition. \u201cIt\u2019s not far from here.\u201d</p><p>Nick pulled out of the parking lot, sliding his sunglasses on. Kelly grinned at him, kicking his feet up onto the dashboard. \u201cI know I always used to make fun of you and Owen for being history nerds, but I got to say, it\u2019s kind of doing it for me right now.\u201d</p><p>Nick glanced at him, and the sun flashed in his aviators.</p><p>Kelly nodded, still smiling widely. \u201cThe way you just pull facts out of your head like it\u2019s magic? It\u2019s hot.\u201d</p><p>Nick chuckled and returned his attention to the road.</p><p>\u201cO\u2019Flaherty?\u201d Hagan\u2019s voice came from the phone on Nick\u2019s lap. Nick picked it up and held it against the steering wheel.</p><p>\u201cHey, what you got for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Hagan asked.</p><p>\u201cThe letters you were supposed to be reading over. Have you found anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBro, you took the letters with you.\u201d</p><p>Nick looked down sharply, then at Kelly. \u201cWe didn\u2019t take anything,\u201d Nick told Hagan.</p><p>\u201cYour buddy Cross came in before you left, told me you wanted him and JD to skim over the letters last night for a lead. Said you\u2019d decided they would catch more than I could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck!\u201d Nick shouted.</p><p>\u201cDid I get played by a CIA hit man?\u201d Hagan asked dejectedly.</p><p>\u201cFuck, fuck, fuck! That\u2019s why Cross ditched us, and that\u2019s why he wasn\u2019t interested in finding anything on the bridge.</p><p>He has the right location already.\u201d</p><p>Kelly leaned forward and flipped the flashing lights on.</p><p>\u201cWe better get there first then, huh?\u201d</p><p>Nick gunned the engine, and the Range Rover roared to life as he gave Hagan their destination. Kelly settled back to enjoy the ride.</p><p>Nick wasn\u2019t trying to hide the Range Rover. It was a distinctive car, especially since everybody and their brother had seen him driving it. He wanted the other players in this to know he was there, that he and Kelly weren\u2019t the stupid grunts they\u2019d assumed.</p><p>So he parked it right on the street in front of the swinging white sign that denoted the Jason Russell House. \u201cSite of the bloodiest fighting between the Minutemen and the Redcoats on the first day of the American Revolution,\u201d it claimed.</p><p>Kelly gave him a questioning glance, then got out of the car. Between them they only had two guns, and they each carried a knife. Nick had a feeling his badge wasn\u2019t going to be a lot of help to them when this all went down.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s our play?\u201d Kelly asked.</p><p>Nick clucked his tongue. \u201cJD and his accomplices in handcuffs. Help Cross retrieve Cameron and then kick his fucking ass. And the location of any possible treasure in the hands of the appropriate authorities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are the appropriate authorities in this case?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Not me,\u201d Nick growled, and they started off across the lush lawn toward the large yellow house.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you know about this site?\u201d Kelly asked.</p><p>\u201cNothing, why?\u201d</p><p>Kelly did a double take as they walked. \u201cNothing? Seriously? I thought you knew everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly thing I know is this is the path the British took when they retreated to Boston. Obviously something important happened and now it\u2019s a museum.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmart-ass.\u201d</p><p>Nick stepped up to the door and tried the handle. It was locked. The sign had indicated the place was open from mid- April to October.</p><p>\u201cMaybe they mean late mid-April,\u201d Kelly said.</p><p>Nick used his badge to knock on the window. They could hear someone moving inside, and finally a woman with a white bonnet and a Revolutionary-era costume came bustling up to the door.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, dear, we\u2019re closed for the day,\u201d she said through the window.</p><p>Nick held the badge up for her to see through the glass. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll only need a minute,\u201d he told her.</p><p>She took a deep stuttering breath and glanced furtively over her shoulder. \u201cIf you\u2019ll come back tomorrow,\u201d she said, her voice shaky.</p><p>Nick cocked his head, looking behind her into the ancient home. The stairs still sported bullet holes from the fighting over two-hundred years ago, and everything had been restored to its original state. Like most homes built in Massachusetts during the early days, the front faced south.</p> <p>The afternoon light streamed through the western windows, and Nick could see a shadow moving on the floorboards in front of the stairwell.</p><p>He gave the woman a nod and a smile. \u201cTomorrow it is then,\u201d he said kindly. \u201cThank you, ma\u2019am.\u201d He turned away from the door and pulled Kelly with him.</p><p>\u201cSomeone had a gun on her,\u201d Kelly whispered.</p><p>Nick hummed and pointed toward the car, slipping Kelly his gun while their backs were turned to the house. \u201cI want you to go around back, get in the house quiet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d</p> <p>Kelly headed around the corner of the house, disappearing within seconds. Nick took out his phone and dialed Hagan. It was still ringing when the door creaked open behind him. He turned, holding the phone away from his ear.</p><p>A man stood with the woman in the bonnet, his arm around her neck and a knife to her cheek. \u201cPut that mobile down,\u201d he ordered. His was another Irish accent. \u201cGet inside.\u201d</p><p>Nick dropped his phone to the ground without ending the call and put his hands behind his head, walking toward the door obediently.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a cop?\u201d the man spat. \u201cSon of a bitch.\u201d He slammed the door behind Nick, and shoved the woman at him, forcing them both through a doorway. \u201cGet in there!\u201d</p><p>Nick caught her and put an arm around her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d he asked as they moved into the other room.</p> <p>She nodded jerkily. Nick walked her over to a nearby chair and she sat, then he turned and stood in front of her. Only then did he get a good look at the other players in the room.</p><p>There was one more man with a gun, and a third hunched against the wall near the fireplace. It took a moment for Nick to recognize him. Cameron Jacobs.</p><p>\u201cCam?\u201d he blurted. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDetective O\u2019Flaherty?\u201d Cameron made to stand, but he winced away from one of his captors when the man made a move toward him. He had a few bruises around his face and arms, and his lip was cracked and bloody. He\u2019d obviously been kept under control through physical means.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Nick shouted. \u201cTouch him again and you deal with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to get hard, motherfucker? Come on!\u201d the man challenged. His accent sounded like home to Nick. It almost made him laugh. Some Southie thug with a gun coming at him like he\u2019d last a minute hand-to-hand with Nick.</p><p>\u201cSit the fuck down!\u201d the other kidnapper shouted at Nick.</p><p>Nick remained standing, meeting the man\u2019s eyes without flinching. The guy moved closer, putting the muzzle of his gun against Nick\u2019s cheek. \u201cI said sit your arse down.\u201d</p> <p>Nick cocked his head, lips twitching. \u201cMake me.\u201d</p><p>Before the man could react, Kelly whistled behind him.</p><p>When he turned, Nick grabbed the gun, hitting a pressure point in the man\u2019s arm that would immediately incapacitate his fingers. Kelly hit him with a roundhouse punch that threw him back into Nick, and Nick picked him up and slammed him to his back. The floor shook beneath him, artifacts around the room rattled. Nick kicked the heel of his boot into the man\u2019s head to put him down. The museum curator screamed, covering her face with her bonnet.</p><p>Nick turned his stolen gun on the other man, but he had grabbed Cameron and was using him as a shield.</p><p>\u201cOh, son,\u201d Nick drawled. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t your smartest move.\u201d</p><p>A dark shadow passed in the corner of Nick\u2019s vision.</p><p>\u201cYou might want to let him go,\u201d Nick warned.</p><p>\u201cFuck you! Put your guns down or he gets one in the skul !\u201d</p><p>The door creaked open behind Nick, and Kelly turned to cover their new guests as Nick kept his gun on the Southie kid.</p><p>\u201cLooks like we\u2019re having a party.\u201d It was the smooth honey tones of Alex. \u201cAre we invited?\u201d She moved around the corner, a gun pointed at Nick.</p><p>\u201cDrop your weapon,\u201d Kelly ordered.</p><p>\u201cYou first. Ladies can\u2019t be too careful these days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll of you drop your weapons!\u201d the Southie kid shouted.</p><p>\u201cCam, stay calm,\u201d Nick called across the room. There were way too many guns in play now. Nick moved just enough to put his shoulder to Kelly\u2019s, both of them facing opposite directions in the middle of the two forces.</p><p>\u201cCameron?\u201d Julian called. He stepped out into the open.</p><p>Nick couldn\u2019t see him, but he could tell where he was from his heavy footsteps on the old floorboards. He felt Kelly tense against him.</p><p>\u201cJulian!\u201d Cameron cried. He tensed, but the gun at his cheek dug deeper.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t fucking move!\u201d Southie shouted.</p><p>The man on the floor groaned, and Nick turned, preparing to deliver another swift kick to the man\u2019s temple.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d a new voice said urgently. \u201cHe\u2019s got information we need.\u201d</p><p>Nick\u2019s head jerked up. JD was standing behind Southie, obviously having snuck in from the kitchen. He had Nick\u2019s gun in his hand, but he wasn\u2019t pointing it anywhere. Yet.</p><p>\u201cJD,\u201d Nick said in warning.</p><p>\u201cHunt!\u201d Alex called.</p><p>Kelly hummed under his breath, and the sound vibrated through Nick\u2019s entire body. They pressed closer together, their first instinct when they were hemmed in. \u201cThere are way too many people here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone stay calm,\u201d Nick said in a loud, clear voice. \u201cWe can all leave here with what we want. No one has to get hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe keeps that gun pointed at my husband, and someone will indeed be hurt,\u201d Julian snarled.</p><p>\u201cTell him to put his gun down,\u201d Southie shouted, nodding his head at Nick. \u201cOr I blow his head off!\u201d</p><p>Nick felt Julian move, and Kelly tensed beside him but couldn\u2019t take his attention off Alex and her gun. Nick glanced back in time to see Julian with the barrel of his gun aimed at Kelly.</p><p>He sounded apologetic, but deadly serious. \u201cDrop your gun, O\u2019Flaherty.\u201d</p><p>The man on the floor groaned again and raised his head, shaking off the stupor. He rolled to his stomach and began to crawl toward his compatriot. His hand went to his belt, where a backup weapon was likely hidden. Nick transferred his aim to the man. \u201cStop!\u201d</p><p>In rapid succession, Southie turned his gun from Cameron\u2019s head to Nick, and JD raised his gun and put it to the back of Southie\u2019s head.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d JD ordered.</p><p>No one moved.</p><p>\u201cEveryone have a gun on them now?\u201d Alex called. \u201cIs this what boys do for fun?\u201d</p><p>Nick grunted, afraid to move with so many nervous and inexperienced personalities involved. Not to mention Julian, who would definitely blow out the brains of an ally to save his husband.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Nick said slowly. \u201cNo one move, let\u2019s talk this one out, huh? Bottom line, Cross is here for Cam and the rest of you are here for treasure. I think we can accommodate everyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you here for, cop?\u201d the man on the ground asked.</p><p>\u201cI heard they had doughnuts,\u201d Nick said through his teeth.</p><p>\u201cTreasure?\u201d the woman in the bonnet asked. She was nearly screaming. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Continental payroll,\u201d Nick said to her. \u201cKnow about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d she said, wiping a hand over her face. \u201cYou\u2019re in the wrong town! The Continental payroll was stolen from Buckman Tavern in Lexington!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would have been brought this way,\u201d JD said, speaking to the entire room. \u201cI remembered why we had to break into that bookstore. I remembered everything, Nick.\u201d</p><p>Nick glanced up at him briefly, afraid to take his eyes off the kidnapper on the floor for too long.</p><p>\u201cThey took me from my hotel room,\u201d JD continued.</p><p>\u201cAlex, I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t leave you guys. Two men came in with guns and said I was dead if I didn\u2019t come with them.\u201d</p><p>If Alex responded, she did so silently, because Nick heard nothing from behind him. JD\u2019s blue eyes pleaded with Nick.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a bad person, Nick. I swear. I remember. Please.\u201d</p><p>Nick tried not to examine the melancholy feeling settling in his chest. \u201cI believe you,\u201d he finally whispered. \u201cTell us what happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere were three of them,\u201d JD said as he poked his gun at Southie\u2019s head. \u201cTwo Irish guys, and this one. They had Cam with them, had him tied up. I kept promising him I\u2019d try to get us out of there and he kept saying his husband would find us, that he was some sort of spy.\u201d</p><p>Cameron closed his eyes, swallowing hard.</p><p>\u201cThey had Julian after the Crown Jewels lead, so they put me on studying the contemporary writings, trying to pinpoint when and where the wagon of treasure had been spotted. I knew about the letters in the bookstore because I\u2019d requested to read them a couple months back. I had the digital copies, but I needed to see the original ones. So much in that time period was done in secret, the originals could have had messages concealed in them. That\u2019s why we went to the store, that\u2019s why they robbed it. I hid the letters to slow them down until someone figured out we needed help or we could get away.\u201d</p><p>Nick couldn\u2019t take his eyes off JD as he spoke. His voice was shaky, his eyes were sincere. Every bone in Nick\u2019s body told him JD was telling the truth.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you figure out it was here?\u201d Kelly asked without turning around.</p><p>\u201cWhen I started remembering things, I remembered a diary entry about this place. How a wagon was seen being guarded by the redcoats. It was the last sighting. And then the name on the headstone, Russell. As soon as I remembered everything, I knew it had to be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe did the same,\u201d Julian offered. \u201cAs soon as I told her what I knew, she directed us here.\u201d</p><p>Nick growled softly. \u201cYeah, we need to talk about the stealing evidence thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather talk about the gun to my head thing,\u201d Kelly said wryly.</p><p>\u201cWhere is it?\u201d the man on the ground asked. \u201cWe\u2019ll let him go without hurting him if you tell us.\u201d</p><p>Julian growled.</p><p>\u201cHow did you get here?\u201d JD asked him.</p><p>\u201cI called them,\u201d Julian answered.</p><p>\u201cGreat, so no one actually knows where we\u2019re looking?\u201d</p><p>Kelly asked.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no treasure here!\u201d the curator cried. \u201cThis museum commemorates a battle!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened here?\u201d Nick asked her. \u201cWhat\u2019s the story? Give us the tour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre . . . are you serious?\u201d</p><p>Nick nodded, still not looking away from the man on the ground.</p><p>The woman glanced around at all the hardware being wielded, at all the people filling a little house that must have seen so much violence in its history, if the bullet holes still in the walls were any indication. She took a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cAfter their defeat at Lexington and Concord, the redcoats were retreating to Boston. Along Battle Road there were many skirmishes, and the retreating forces were ordered to clear out any houses they came across to prevent snipers from attacking.</p><p>Jason Russell, the man who lived here, evacuated his family, but then returned to his home. Nearby, along the stone wall you probably saw when you came in, the minutemen had set up an ambush. They concentrated on the main body of the redcoats coming through, but were outflanked and retreated to this home.\u201d</p><p>She took a deep, shuddering breath. It was obvious that giving her lecture was helping to calm her a little. Nick\u2019s mind was whirring, trying to fit the puzzle together as she gave them more pieces.</p><p>\u201cJason Russell was an old man, and he arrived at his home just as the minutemen were retreating. He was gunned down just outside his door and then stabbed by bayonets eleven times. The British soldiers massacred everyone else in the house, save for eight minutemen who were able to barricade themselves in the basement. When Jason Russell\u2019s widow returned to her home, she found her husband and the rest of the dead, numbering twelve men total, laid out in rows in the kitchen. She is said to have claimed the blood on the kitchen floor rose to her ankles. Jason Russell and the dead Continental soldiers were buried in a mass grave, no coffins and no services. It took over seventy years for a monument to be erected over the grave.\u201d</p><p>She fell silent, swallowing repeatedly, blinking rapidly as she fought off tears.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d the Irishman on the ground asked.</p><p>\u201cThat is . . . it. Yes. There is no treasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the basement?\u201d Alex suggested.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re looking for redcoat treasure; the basement was barricaded by minutemen,\u201d JD countered.</p><p>Nick slowly lowered his gun, his eyes unfocusing.</p><p>\u201cNick?\u201d Kelly whispered.</p><p>Nick didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>\u201cIrish?\u201d</p><p>Nick winced and lowered his head. \u201cFuck,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Kelly lowered his weapon as well, meeting Nick\u2019s eyes with a dawning dread. \u201cYou know where the treasure is, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know where the treasure is,\u201d Nick confirmed. He looked at the woman apologetically. \u201cCan you tell us exactly how big that monument is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOver the grave?\u201d</p><p>Nick nodded. Someone in the room cursed under his breath. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt . . . it\u2019s rather large. It\u2019s a granite obelisk. Maybe twelve feet tal ?\u201d</p><p>Nick nodded, lowering his gun further. \u201cThat\u2019s that,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThey buried the treasure with minutemen?\u201d JD asked.</p> <p>\u201cThey knew the grave wouldn\u2019t be desecrated by Colonials, so the treasure would stay hidden. And when the war was lost, going back to the shiny new America and digging up national heroes was not an option for any persona non grata like an Irish redcoat.\u201d</p><p>Nick glanced sideways at Kelly. Kelly slowly lowered his gun, his body relaxing against Nick\u2019s. Alex had stowed her weapon as well, and she looked crestfallen. She seemed to really be in it to find missing pieces of history, not merely for profit.</p><p>Julian had transferred his aim back to Southie, who was still holding Cameron and pointing his gun at Nick.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d Nick said softly. \u201cGame\u2019s over. Time to give up the gun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you, we didn\u2019t come this close to let a piece of fucking rock get in the way. We\u2019ll come back tonight with a Cat. Knock that bitch over, dig up our treasure, and get our payday.\u201d</p> <p>Kelly looked over his shoulder, his brow furrowed. He didn\u2019t dare turn around though, not when he knew there was still a gun pointed at Nick.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re leaving, and we\u2019re taking this fucker with us as insurance,\u201d Southie snarled with a jab at Cameron\u2019s cheek.</p><p>\u201cOver my dead body,\u201d Julian growled. \u201cNo. Make that over your dead body.\u201d</p><p>Nick felt the mood in the room shift almost instantly.</p><p>It was an instinct honed over many years of gunfights and negotiations, the ability to tell when a situation had just turned hopeless.</p><p>The man on the ground went for his belt, where a gun had indeed been hidden beneath his shirt. Nick shoved his shoulder into Kelly, sending them both to the floor.</p> <p>Southie fired at them, holding Cameron in front of him as a human shield. Cameron knocked his elbow into Southie\u2019s chin, and Southie stumbled back, falling into JD as the gun went off again.</p><p>Nick sat up and fired a single shot, taking the Irishman through the back of the hand as he attempted to pull the trigger. His gun went flying and he screamed, holding his bloody hand to his chest.</p><p>Julian also took one shot, but he wasn\u2019t aiming to maim.</p><p>Southie took the bullet right between the eyes as he was trying to scramble to his feet. His body made a solid thud when it hit the floorboards.</p><p>And just like that, it was over. Nick slowly got to his feet, gun still in hand. Alex had taken cover on the stairs, and as soon as she raised her head, Nick gestured to her to get out of the house. She darted forward, not for the door, but for the museum curator with her bonnet in hand. Alex pulled her to her feet and propelled her toward the door, running after her and shielding the woman\u2019s body with her own.</p><p>Julian pulled something from his pocket and tossed it into the center of the room. Nick stared at it, not registering what it was.</p><p>\u201cFlashbang!\u201d Kelly shouted, and he grabbed Nick and pulled him down. They both covered their ears and squeezed their eyes tight as the flash grenade went off.</p><p>The high-pitched whine in Nick\u2019s ears was one he knew all too well, and even with his eyes closed and his face buried against Kelly\u2019s chest, the flash had caused stars behind his eyes. He sat up dazedly, trying to shake off the cobwebs.</p> <p>Julian and Cameron were both gone.</p><p>\u201cMotherfucker,\u201d Nick muttered. A groan from the other side of the room drew his attention, and Nick struggled to his feet. He bent over Kelly first, patting his cheek. \u201cOkay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate those things,\u201d Kelly shouted. He put a finger in his ear and wiggled it.</p><p>Nick nodded, straightening. He stumbled through the smoke across the room and found JD on his back, blood flowing freely from a wound in his torso. Nick stared at him for a few seconds, his mind chugging to catch up.</p><p>\u201cCorpsman up!\u201d he finally called, his voice so hoarse that Kelly\u2019s abused ears didn\u2019t hear it. \u201cDoc! Man down!\u201d</p><p>Kelly fumbled his way over, fal ing to his knees at JD\u2019s side.</p><p>Nick patted his pockets for his phone before remembering he\u2019d dropped it outside before all the shooting had started.</p><p>When he looked down at his hand, he realized there was blood spreading across his shirt. He pulled his jacket away, confused about where it was coming from. When he pulled his shirt up, he found the wound.</p><p>\u201cGo call an ambulance, Irish,\u201d Kelly said to him. He was working on JD, trying to stop the blood.</p><p>\u201cKels,\u201d Nick whispered.</p><p>\u201cGo cal !\u201d Kelly shouted without looking up.</p><p>Nick nodded. When he turned to go after his phone, though, a man was standing there, gun drawn, badge out.</p><p>Nick stopped in his tracks, blinking at him.</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch, Nick!\u201d Hagan shouted.</p><p>Nick winced, and his head pounded. He took a step back, his foot hit something on the floor, and he sat down hard.</p><p>Kelly\u2019s hand groped for him, his fingers finally threading through Nick\u2019s as Nick lay back and put a hand over his eyes to block out all the brightness.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re hit!\u201d Kelly shouted at him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not bad,\u201d Nick muttered. \u201cNot bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay with me, bud,\u201d he could hear Kelly saying. \u201cDon\u2019t let go.\u201d</p><p>Nick turned his head. Kelly was sitting between JD and Nick. He was holding his shirt to JD\u2019s wound with one hand, and pressed Nick\u2019s palm to his own wound with the other.</p><p>Nick cried out.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let go, okay?\u201d Kelly whispered to him, applying more pressure to the wound.</p><p>\u201cNever,\u201d Nick managed to say. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>Kelly leaned over and kissed him gently. The warmth of his lips was painful on Nick\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cIs he okay?\u201d Nick asked, head rol ing in JD\u2019s direction.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be fine if we get an ambulance to him soon.\u201d</p><p>Nick closed his eyes. The pain from the pressure against his wound was gone. Everything was gone except Kelly\u2019s hand on his.</p><p>\u201cSo will you, bud,\u201d Kelly added, and his voice was far away, echoing off the recesses of Nick\u2019s memories. \u201cYou\u2019ll be okay. Don\u2019t let go.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 10</p><p>elly stood off to the side, his hands stuffed in his Kpockets so he wouldn\u2019t be tempted to jump in and help. The bullet that had hit Nick had punched clean through the muscle over his ribs, right above another bullet graze he\u2019d received recently, and along with the massive Y-shaped incision from his recent surgery, Nick\u2019s torso was going to be more scar than skin after this. Knowing Nick, he\u2019d turn those scars into some sort of tattoo eventually.</p><p>The wound probably wasn\u2019t too serious, but the loss of blood meant they were loading him onto a stretcher and preparing to put him into one of the ambulances standing by.</p><p>JD hadn\u2019t fared quite as well. The kidnapper with the Boston accent had shot him as they\u2019d struggled, and while the bullet had gone all the way through, it had clipped some vital pieces on its way out. They\u2019d loaded him into an ambulance and taken him off with a police escort before Kelly and Nick had even gotten out of the building.</p><p>Alex Kincade, who really was who she\u2019d said she was this time, was cooperating with all the questioning she\u2019d been submitted to so far. She\u2019d been legally contracted to find the whereabouts of the treasure. Kelly felt sort of sorry for the fact that she was out of a job now. Her colleague, Colin, had showed up five minutes after it\u2019d all gone down with a tray of coffees. They obviously hadn\u2019t been expecting trouble.</p><p>Hagan was grilling the Irish kidnapper in the back of his unmarked car. Kelly thought Hagan was telling the man he\u2019d only send someone into the house to find the fingers Nick had shot off if he talked, but Kelly was trying hard not to listen since he was pretty sure that wasn\u2019t legal.</p><p>Julian Cross and Cameron Jacobs were in the wind. Kelly had a feeling they wouldn\u2019t be seeing either man again.</p><p>Soon enough, Nick was being wheeled over to the ambulance, and Kelly jogged over to take his hand as they negotiated the curb.</p><p>Nick shook his head, obviously knowing Kelly was trying to come up with something nice and cheerful to distract him with.</p><p>\u201cWhen we were in New Orleans and I took that bullet,\u201d Kelly said, like he was starting a bedtime story. \u201cAll I remember is you leaning over me and asking me what to do.\u201d</p><p>Nick snorted and squeezed his eyes tight. The stretcher jostled him and he winced. \u201cThat was Digger, Kels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas it?\u201d Kelly laughed. \u201cAll I remember is you. And the only thing I could think to tell you was don\u2019t let go. Don\u2019t let go of me. That\u2019s all I could say.\u201d</p><p>Nick opened his eyes, meeting Kelly\u2019s as his grip on Kelly\u2019s fingers turned almost painful. \u201cYou never said that, Doc.\u201d</p><p>Kelly blinked. \u201cI didn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t say anything. You tried.\u201d</p><p>Kelly waited a beat, brow furrowed. \u201cI always thought I got it out because . . . you held on to me the whole time.\u201d He glanced up as they neared the ambulance. When he looked back down, Nick\u2019s eyes were on him, that same smitten, indulgent gaze Kelly had grown accustomed to over the past year. His hand tightened in Nick\u2019s. \u201cI thought I said it. You never let go of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t,\u201d Nick gasped. Kelly didn\u2019t know if he was in pain or if the memory of Kelly\u2019s near-death experience in New Orleans was overwhelming him. \u201cI couldn\u2019t let go of you, Kels.\u201d</p><p>Kelly struggled to swallow, nodding and holding back the urge to cry. He squeezed Nick\u2019s hand harder. \u201cNeither will I.\u201d</p><p>He had to, though, to let the EMTs load Nick into the ambulance. Kelly followed them to the hospital in the Range Rover, his mind tossing and turning over the events of the day.</p><p>Had they really just tracked down a centuries old treasure? Was it possible the Continental payroll was more than merely gold bars, that it was really a missing Masonic treasure trove? His mind was reeling with the possibilities, but all he really wanted was to get to Nick. He\u2019d go over the implications of the past few days later, when he knew Nick was okay.</p><p>When he finally found Nick in the hospital, he was already sitting up and bitching because they\u2019d cut his shirt off him.</p><p>\u201cIt had a bullet hole in it,\u201d the nurse argued.</p><p>\u201cIt was a graze!\u201d Nick shouted.</p><p>She rolled her eyes as she left the room, nodding to Kelly when she passed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re running out of spare clothes, babe,\u201d Kelly said with a relieved grin. If Nick could bitch about his clothes, he was doing just fine, despite his so-called \u201cgraze\u201d actually being a through-and-through. They had an IV in him, probably with pain medication in there, and they were giving him a transfusion for the blood he\u2019d lost.</p><p>\u201cI want to go home,\u201d Nick grunted.</p><p>Kelly strolled into the room, nodding to placate him.</p><p>\u201cSoon. Get a little more blood in you first, huh?\u201d</p><p>Nick didn\u2019t say anything. He reached out when Kelly got close, grabbed a handful of his hair, and pulled him into a ruthless kiss. He left Kelly panting when their lips parted, and Nick closed his eyes, sighing as if he\u2019d been holding his breath until he could get Kelly into his hands.</p><p>Kelly took him by both shoulders and forced him to recline. \u201cFaster you get this over with, faster we\u2019ll go home. Promise.\u201d</p><p>Nick nodded, his eyes staying closed.</p><p>Kelly sat on the edge of his bed, reading the medications labels, trying to just be a worried lover rather than a worried SARC for once. He leaned over Nick and pressed his forehead to Nick\u2019s, closing his eyes. He didn\u2019t know how long they stayed that way, but when a PA came in to check Nick\u2019s stitches and vitals, it was dark outside.</p><p>Despite the doctor\u2019s advice, Nick demanded that he be allowed to go home, claiming Kelly was perfectly capable of keeping an eye on him overnight. They had no choice but to let him check himself out, and Kelly knew Nick too well to argue against it.</p><p>Kelly helped him to his feet, and Nick hugged him close, pressing his face against Kelly\u2019s cheek. \u201cTake me home,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Kelly nodded jerkily. He wrapped his arm around Nick\u2019s waist, letting him rest some weight on him as he helped him over to the wheelchair.</p><p>Once Nick was in the passenger seat of the Range Rover, Kelly hopped behind the wheel. Nick was silent on the drive home, keeping his eyes shut as Kelly struggled with the GPS.</p><p>He finally got it to work and headed for the route home, glancing at Nick worriedly.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he said. He reached over the console and touched Nick\u2019s thigh. \u201cYou should be proud of yourself. You found a two-hundred-year-old missing treasure today.\u201d</p><p>Nick chuckled softly, the sound sending a chill up Kelly\u2019s spine. He opened his eyes and sighed. \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Kelly took his eyes off the road long enough to look at Nick. \u201cYou were faking it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d Nick closed his eyes and sighed again. \u201cNo idea where that treasure is. I know where it\u2019s not, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not under that monument. Redcoats didn\u2019t dig that grave; they never stopped to bury the rebel dead. It\u2019s not there.\u201d</p><p>Kelly stared at him for so long he almost ran off the road.</p><p>\u201cHuh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou had me going. I didn\u2019t know you could still fake something and fool me.\u201d Nick was staring at him again.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>Kelly grinned lopsidedly, biting his lip and nodding.</p><p>\u201cYeah, you do.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They were silent for most of the ride home. Nick actually dozed for a little while, until they got into the older part of the city where the streets were smaller and confusing and Kelly almost killed them by not realizing that a Boston turn signal was just a blaring horn rather than a blinking light.</p><p>He breathed a sigh of relief when he got them to the marina in one piece. \u201cFrom now on, you do the driving.\u201d</p><p>Nick nodded. He was gripping the handle above his head so tight his knuckles were white. \u201cDeal.\u201d</p> <p>Kelly helped him ease out of the car. It was a long walk down the docks to the Fiddler\u2019s Green, and Kelly could have kissed the boat when he finally saw it. Nick was shucking his hospital gown and jeans before they\u2019d even closed the doors to the salon behind them.</p><p>\u201cShower. Bed,\u201d Nick grunted.</p><p>He disappeared down the steps, and Kelly trailed along in his path, picking up the things he\u2019d discarded. A badge here, a gun there. He was on his way to the steps when he noticed a card on the galley counter that certainly hadn\u2019t been there when he and JD had left the boat the day before.</p><p>He picked it up, frowning at the precise handwriting.</p><p>\u201cDetective O\u2019Flaherty and Doc Abbott.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d Kelly glanced around the yacht out of habit. He didn\u2019t feel anything out of place, didn\u2019t have that sense that someone was with him or that he was being watched. The envelope wasn\u2019t sealed, so Kelly pulled the card out and cocked his head at it. It was a simple sheet of creamy white stationery, and the only things written on it were an international phone number and the letter J.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Nick asked. He had poked his head above the railing and was scowling at Kelly.</p><p>Kelly held the letter up. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t kidding. He left us a \u2018get out of jail free\u2019 card.\u201d</p><p>Nick stared at the card with Julian\u2019s number on it, then nodded. \u201cSave that shit for the next time Grady calls us,\u201d he drawled. \u201cCome help me shower.\u201d</p><p>Kelly left the card on the table, along with Nick\u2019s badge and sidearm, and followed after him, stripping as he went.</p><p>Two hours later, they were curled together in bed, Nick\u2019s head resting on Kelly\u2019s chest and his arm wrapped around him as he snored. Kelly stared at the ceiling, frowning. They\u2019d showered and Kelly had checked Nick\u2019s stitches. Nick had even taken a few of the painkillers the hospital had given him, which meant he thought everything was over.</p> <p>Nothing felt over.</p><p>Nick\u2019s phone rang from beneath the pillow, where he apparently stuffed it all the time. It made the pillow vibrate.</p><p>How that didn\u2019t set him straight off into a flashback every time it rang, Kelly didn\u2019t know.</p><p>Nick woke with a gasp and dug the phone out, answering it before he even had his eyes open. \u201cO\u2019Flaherty.\u201d</p><p>Kelly was so close to Nick\u2019s face that he could hear the voice on the other end. \u201cJD\u2019s out of surgery, he\u2019s awake and he\u2019s remembering more and more,\u201d Hagan was saying. \u201cHe\u2019ll only talk to you, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Nick said on a sigh. \u201cBe right there.\u201d</p><p>He hung up, and they stared at each other for a few seconds, both of them silent, both of them frowning.</p><p>\u201cI have to go,\u201d Nick finally mumbled. \u201cTake his statement, wrap this up.\u201d</p> <p>Kelly nodded, unsure of why this simple phone cal , out of everything that had happened in the last few days, was the first thing to truly upset him. He tried not to let it show, but Nick could read him like book. He had been able to from the day they\u2019d met.</p><p>Nick swallowed hard. \u201cIt\u2019s always going to be like this,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cThere\u2019s always going to be another case. Another call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But you love everything about your job.\u201d</p><p>Nick bit his lip and dropped his eyes. His finger traced the pink scar on Kelly\u2019s chest, where a bullet meant for Nick\u2019s head had stopped just below Kelly\u2019s heart instead.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not going to work,\u201d Nick finally said with a sigh.</p><p>The air left Kelly\u2019s lung so fast he had to gasp to reclaim it. His body tingled, and a shiver ran through him before he could manage a sad smile. He ran his fingers through Nick\u2019s hair. \u201cAre you breaking up with me, babe? \u2019Cause that\u2019s what this feels like.\u201d</p><p>Nick quickly met his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m quitting,\u201d he declared.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wrap up this case, then give them my resignation.\u201d</p><p>Kelly held his breath, his heart pounding out his relief like Morse code. He was uncertain of whether he wanted to encourage Nick to do it this time, or talk him out of it again. Then the melancholy feeling of that phone call settled into his chest, the same feeling he\u2019d always suffered back in the day when he\u2019d said good-bye to Nick on leave, the same hollow sense of something missing when he\u2019d watched Nick escort a woman out of a bar, the same ache he woke up with when he was in bed alone in Colorado and knew Nick was so many miles away in Boston. The same feeling that had rushed through his body when he\u2019d thought Nick might be choosing his badge over Kelly.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to feel that every time Nick got a call and had to leave him behind.</p><p>He nodded, his entire body heavy with the decision. He\u2019d talked Nick out of quitting before because he knew Nick loved his job, and he\u2019d been curious to see if it would work, if they would work, with their lives continuing on the way they had been. They\u2019d tried it, and it didn\u2019t work. It was the right decision this time, and Kelly could rest easy knowing Nick had chosen him over his former life and would have no regrets.</p><p>Nick kissed him. \u201cCome with me.\u201d</p><p>Kelly grinned. \u201cI\u2019m going to be hearing that a lot in the next fifty years, aren\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can guarantee it.\u201d</p><p>Nick took the wheel for their trip to the hospital. He trusted Kelly with his life in most situations, but driving in Boston was apparently not one of those situations because he would sooner fuck a rhinoceros than do that again. Even drugged up, he would get them to the hospital safer than Kelly would.</p><p>\u201cSo, I have an idea,\u201d Kelly announced on the way there.</p><p>\u201cAre you in an Abbott Idea kind of mood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I am drugged, so yeah, shoot.\u201d</p><p>Kelly chuckled. \u201cEmma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmma . . . Grady? Ty\u2019s cousin, Emma?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Kelly was nodding. \u201cShe offered us both a job with her team, and as far as I know the offer still stands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re talking about Emma Grady,\u201d Nick said again.</p><p>\u201cAnd the adventuring, treasure-hunting, monster-seeking, myth-believing crew of crazy people?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey need a medic, a historian, and team leader. And if I\u2019m not mistaken, we are a medic and a team leader. Plus, you\u2019re quite the fucking historian if I do say so myself. And I do.\u201d\u201cKels, I\u2019m not so sure about that shit,\u201d Nick said.</p><p>\u201cI mean . . .\u201d He glanced at Kelly, who was sitting in the passenger seat watching him. Smiling. He was always smiling.</p><p>Nick came to a stop at a red light and stared at Kelly, thinking about that smile.</p><p>\u201cWe said before that we didn\u2019t know what to do. Colorado or Boston? Cabin or boat?\u201d Kelly said. He shrugged. \u201cWhy choose, though? If you\u2019re quitting, I can too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKels, you love that camp. Those kids,\u201d Nick argued. Kelly had been orphaned at twelve, and while his experience in the foster system had been a good one, he had still devoted his post-military life to helping troubled kids\u2014often orphaned or abandoned street kids who\u2019d chosen the camp over juvenile hal \u2014adjust and learn life skills. It had given Kelly purpose at a time when every member of Sidewinder had been drifting and listless.</p><p>\u201cI could still volunteer here and there. We\u2019ll have down time, time to . . . Nicko, we can settle down when we\u2019re dead, babe,\u201d Kelly finally said. \u201cI had fun this week. For the first time in years, this was really fucking fun. I want to do things like this with you, I want\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Nick whispered.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Nick said, his voice stronger. \u201cWe\u2019ll call her when we get home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>Nick smirked.</p><p>Kelly\u2019s smile burgeoned into a ful -force beaming grin. He reached across the console and grabbed Nick\u2019s hand, kissing his palm. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Nick tried to repress an indulgent sigh, but he couldn\u2019t.</p><p>He was so screwed. He\u2019d give Kelly anything and everything.</p><p>They were both still grinning like idiots when they reached the hospital. Nick had to school his features into a more professional mask as they inquired into JD\u2019s room number and rode the elevator up.</p><p>When they found the room, Hagan was there, and so was Alex. She was sitting beside JD\u2019s bed, filling him in on the details he was still missing. They both looked up when Nick and Kelly entered.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d JD said with a tentative smile.</p><p>\u201cHow you feeling?\u201d Nick asked him. He moved closer, giving Alex a nod in greeting.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d JD scooted up a little in the bed, wincing and holding to his side. \u201cAlex says this isn\u2019t the first time I\u2019ve been shot, so . . . hey, no big deal, right?\u201d</p><p>Nick smiled and patted JD\u2019s arm, unable to quell the urge to continue trying to comfort the man. He noticed a stack of books on the table beside JD\u2019s bed. They were all his adventures, told by him.</p><p>\u201cHis story all checks out, O,\u201d Hagan offered. \u201cHe was taken from his hotel room in New York by a group that had been contracted by a company called Sanco Pharmaceuticals.</p><p>Apparently it\u2019s not uncommon for these big companies to take unusual routes for miracle cures. First time one of them\u2019s ended in kidnapping and murder, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPharmaceutical companies after medieval scrolls,\u201d Kelly mused. \u201cSure, why not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I kicked you in your transplant scar,\u201d JD offered, looking at Nick with what could only be described as hope.</p><p>Nick cocked his head, frowning. \u201cHow\u2019d you know it was there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSaw it the night I was talking to your friend on the phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. Thanks,\u201d Nick grunted. But he couldn\u2019t help but smile. JD\u2014or Casey Hunt, he supposed he was going to have to start thinking of him as\u2014was an interesting man. He was smart, quick-witted, capable, and observant. He\u2019d handled the trauma he\u2019d been subjected to better than most. Despite everything that had happened, Nick liked the guy.</p><p>\u201cSo, are you out of a job now?\u201d Kelly asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, apparently I work out of a museum as a wandering acquisitions specialist,\u201d JD said with a laugh. \u201cAlex was telling me about some of my seedier adventures. It seems I\u2019m kind of a big deal. You should read my books. I know I\u2019m going to have to.\u201d</p><p>Nick and Kelly both chuckled. Kelly waved a hand at Alex. \u201cWhat about you? Are you a seedy adventurer too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said with a melancholy smile. \u201cNot anymore, at least. I am out of a job. I worked ful -time for Alco, hunting down new avenues of research. After all this, they don\u2019t want the scrutiny for why they have an archaeologist on staff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Kelly offered.</p><p>Nick was scowling at Alex, though. She\u2019d shown her true colors during the standoff at the Jason Russell house, shielding the museum guide with her body as she got the woman to safety. She\u2019d shown Nick something, something he liked. He patted Kelly on the arm, and when Kelly turned, Nick jerked his head at Alex. It seemed to dawn on Kelly as well. His oddly colored eyes sparkled, and he grinned at Alex.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to get a cup of coffee?\u201d he asked her. \u201cI have a proposition for you.\u201d</p><p>Alex gave him a wary sideways glance, but after examining the smiles on both their faces, she agreed and followed Kelly out of the room.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that about?\u201d JD asked.</p><p>\u201cKels has a thing for redheads,\u201d Nick quipped. \u201cWe\u2019re going to file these reports in the morning, work to start getting your name nice and clear, okay? You\u2019re going to have to answer for some things, including assaulting an officer of the law and discharging a firearm in a public area.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince I was the officer you assaulted, we can handle that one. National parks are federal territory, though.\u201d</p><p>JD blanched, but he nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll . . . I\u2019ll take the punishment. I did it, I deserve it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got a buddy with some favors owed him in the Bureau,\u201d Nick said. \u201cI\u2019ll see what I can do for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Thanks, Nick.\u201d</p><p>Hagan cleared his throat loudly, shifting his weight from foot to foot.</p><p>JD chuckled. \u201cAnd you, Alan. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>Nick gave Hagan a melancholy once-over. He would have to tell his partner that he was quitting for good this time. It wasn\u2019t going to be a mental health break like last time. There wasn\u2019t going to be any coming back once he tendered his resignation, once he gave up his badge. His stomach turned at the thought. God, was he really ready to do that? He pushed it aside to worry about later, to talk to Kelly about it further, and turned back to JD.</p><p>\u201cI know what you did,\u201d JD said with a smile.</p><p>\u201cOh yeah?\u201d Nick asked. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no treasure under that monument. Not in a grave dug by minutemen.\u201d</p><p>Nick laughed. \u201cI guess you still have some work to do then if you want to find yourself a Golden and Rosy Cross. Huh?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body>  <p>\u201cI guess I do. You could have just put me in a cell, let me rot there,\u201d JD said quickly. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to believe me. But you did. You took me in. You trusted me. You saved my life. I can\u2019t thank all of you enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you can try,\u201d Hagan commented. They all laughed.</p><p>\u201cNext book you write.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll try to remember that.\u201d JD tapped his temple and smirked.</p><p>\u201cAnd hey, when you get out of here you can take us to dinner,\u201d Nick offered. \u201cDrinks on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the least I can do,\u201d JD agreed. He was smiling, though there was a hint of sadness to it. \u201cAnd . . . Nick. You and the Doc don\u2019t work out . . .\u201d He smiled almost shyly, pointing to himself. \u201cMy books claim I\u2019m amazing in bed.\u201d</p><p>Nick laughed. He patted JD\u2019s arm again. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t hold my breath for that if I was you. I\u2019m going to go before Kelly does something I\u2019ll regret.\u201d</p><p>Nick said good-bye to JD, told Hagan he\u2019d see him in the morning, and then left to find his wayward boyfriend. Kelly had probably already recruited Alex, called Emma, signed them up for a trip to Siberia, and gotten on his phone to buy subzero gear.</p> <p>Nick smiled at the thought, but the smile rapidly turned into a worried scowl, and he quickened his pace. The probability that Kelly was already through half those steps was extremely high.</p><p>Well, either way, Nick knew he\u2019d be going along for the ride. </p>  </body></html>"]
