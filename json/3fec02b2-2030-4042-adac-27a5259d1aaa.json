More wings?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, but just the medium ones this time. I\u2019m not too hot on the honey barbecue kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBad pun penalty,\u201d Ty Grady muttered from across the table.</p><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d</p><p>The waitress laughed. She set a pint down in front of Ty and he pointed at her with his celery stick.</p><p>\u201cDesignated Hitter or real baseball?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m cutting you off,\u201d she answered before turning away.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Ty called out, and Zane laughed, the sound almost lost in the midst of the mid-week revelry. Ty turned a glare on him, dipped his celery into a plastic cup of ranch dressing, and then pointed at Zane with it, sending drops of dressing flying. \u201cYou know what we should do next weekend?\u201d he asked without seeming to notice he\u2019d sprayed Zane with ranch.</p><p>Zane grabbed a napkin and wiped up the splatter on his shirt. These weekly outings were the only time Ty drank around him, and he seemed to make up for lost beers at them. Zane didn\u2019t mind. After a few months of regular Wednesday night baseball viewings at the local bar, he was used to Ty\u2019s semi-drunken antics. He had to admit, he enjoyed Ty when he was drunk. And as long as Ty stuck to beer or wine, and Zane continued his AA meetings, he didn\u2019t even fight cravings.</p><p>\u201cWas that a rhetorical question?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. We should go get me another tattoo.\u201d</p><p>Zane loved to see Ty\u2019s mind at work. At first blush, it seemed there was no rhyme or reason to it, but once he\u2019d started paying attention, he could see the tracks Ty\u2019s thoughts followed. Sometimes Ty jumped a track and surprised him, though. Like now. Ty had never mentioned getting another tattoo, had never been caught admiring anyone\u2019s body art. The only reason Ty had gotten the bulldog on his arm was because it meant something dear to him.</p> <p>Zane watched him for a long moment, entranced by his lover just as he always was. What did people see when they looked at the two of them sitting here in the bar? Two friends, watching the game, hanging out? Maybe they sat a little closer together than some guys would, maybe their shoulders brushed more than casual friends\u2019 should. Maybe people saw two men in love. Zane hated living in fear of what other people might see, but until he or Ty retired, that was their life.</p><p>Zane looked at the bulldog on Ty\u2019s arm and raised an eyebrow. \u201cWhat would you get?\u201d</p><p>Ty threw back what was left of his beer, then set the glass down hard, rattling the unstable bar table. He met Zane\u2019s eyes. \u201cBallgame\u2019s over. I\u2019ve been cut off by Designated Daisy. Let\u2019s go home and look for trouble.\u201d</p><p>Zane swallowed hard as Ty\u2019s purr hit a chord deep inside him that only Ty had ever been able to reach. He pulled out his wallet, picked through some cash, and tossed a few bills onto the table. \u201cReady when you are, Bulldog.\u201d</p><p>Ty slid out of his seat, and when Zane came around the table, Ty\u2019s arm snaked around his waist. Most likely it was to keep himself from weaving as they left the bar. Over the months, Ty had grown more comfortable being demonstrative in front of strangers, and it warmed Zane to his toes every time, but it still sent a shiver of nerves through him. Ty had always been the more careful of the two of them, and even he was growing more careless as time went on. What if they were seen by someone who knew them? What if they were found out? Everyone at work knew they were living together, though no one thought anything of it yet except that they were sharing the cost of the mortgage. But they were destined to be outed eventually. The real questions, the ones that haunted him, were, would it matter, and would he even care?</p><p>The summer heat hit them when they exited the bar, even though the sun had long ago set and a salty breeze was blowing in off the nearby harbor. Ty\u2019s arm tightened on Zane\u2019s waist, and Zane slid his hand around Ty\u2019s shoulders as they headed for their row house on Ann Street. He was struck yet again by just how happy they were, despite the obstacles and worries hanging over their heads.</p><p>There were moments when it was all surreal. He\u2019d never expected to live with another person again, never expected to fall head over heels for someone again. For over two months now, he\u2019d been waking to Ty\u2019s arms wrapped around him every morning, and sometimes he wondered if he deserved it.</p><p>Other times he pondered how many tranquilizers it would take to bring Ty down, and whether he could do it before Ty killed him, but those moments passed quickly.</p> <p>Now Ty\u2019s body was hard and warm against him, but his movements were loose and relaxed. He was humming under his breath, and Zane knew it would soon turn into a song. He couldn\u2019t help but smile as he pulled his lover closer. It might just be the rose-tinted color of love\u2019s glasses, but there wasn\u2019t a thing about Ty he didn\u2019t find fascinating, amusing, or smoking hot. He loved it when Ty sang because Ty had a beautiful voice, drunk or not.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s funny, you know?\u201d Ty said. \u201cHow much things have changed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA couple years ago, at this point in the night, I\u2019d be back in that bar with someone in the supply closet.\u201d</p><p>Zane snorted and shook his head. \u201cAnd now you just have to go home with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Ty said, serious as he stopped and turned to look at Zane. \u201cI don\u2019t have to go home with you.\u201d</p><p>Zane raised an eyebrow and cocked his head.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait to get home with you. Even if it\u2019s just to crawl in bed and watch that stupid-ass show you like so much, I don\u2019t care. Whatever I do, I\u2019m glad I\u2019m with you.\u201d</p><p>Zane knew he was grinning like a fool, but sometimes Ty still managed to surprise him with his romantic, sentimental gestures.</p><p>Ty took his arm and continued to walk. Zane watched him out of the corner of his eye, amused and warmed all over.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d Ty said out of the blue, his voice almost sing-song.</p><p>Zane laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re drunk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI loved you before I was drunk.\u201d</p><p>Zane stopped walking and pulled Ty around to face him. The evening was full of the noises of summer night revelry, but the sidewalk was empty. He smiled and leaned in to kiss Ty. \u201cI can\u2019t remember a time that I was happier than I am right now.\u201d</p><p>Ty smiled against his lips, his eyes closed as he wrapped his arms around Zane\u2019s neck. \u201cI bet we can top it when we get home.\u201d</p><p>Zane growled and squeezed Ty\u2019s ass before releasing him. \u201cLet\u2019s go find out.\u201d</p><p>Ty lay tangled in the sheets of the bed he shared with Zane, his head under his pillow. His entire body ached from the gymnastics of the night before. He had carpet burns on his knees. He could feel every place that Zane\u2019s fingers had dug in to hold him down. He was fairly certain there were teeth marks on his shoulder. His insides were a mash of aching, lingering pleasure, and his head was full of cotton. They had to work today, but not for a few hours. He didn\u2019t intend to move until something worthwhile compelled him.</p><p>A rough hand settled on the small of his back. Ty hummed and started to smile. That was compelling.</p><p>He raised his head, letting his pillow slide away as he turned to peer at his bedmate. Zane was still asleep, his handsome face relaxed in the shadows of the early morning. Ty took the opportunity to stare. He\u2019d never expected to have the privilege of waking up every day to someone he loved so dearly. Now that he did, he tried to appreciate it when he could.</p><p>Zane\u2019s hair had grown longer, almost unruly. He\u2019d taken to slicking it back when he worked, and the ends would curl around his ears. Ty loved it. He loved even more that Zane had lost the lines of stress he\u2019d carried for so long, and there were threads of silver hair growing in near his ears that Ty found incredibly sexy.</p><p>He reached out to slide his fingers over Zane\u2019s lips. Zane scrunched up his nose and jerked his head away, grunting in his sleep. Ty bit his lip to keep from laughing and reached to do it again. Zane swatted at him this time, barely missing his hand, and then shifted and twitched his lips.</p><p>Ty waited a moment, then touched Zane\u2019s lips again, letting the tip of his finger brush against them with the utmost care.</p><p>Zane snorted and swatted at him again, smacking himself in the nose and waking with a start and a grunt. Ty pressed his face into his pillow and tried not to let his laughter shake his shoulders.</p><p>He felt Zane move, and peeked over his pillow at him. Zane was watching him, his dark eyes like sleepy obsidian in the morning light.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an ass,\u201d Zane muttered, closing his eyes and turning his head.</p><p>Ty laughed and scooted closer, resting his chin on Zane\u2019s chest and wrapping around him. He dragged his foot along Zane\u2019s calf and slid it against his toes, enjoying the intimate contact and soaking in Zane\u2019s warmth and calm.</p><p>For all that they enjoyed their rough-and-tumble sex, they were both surprisingly good at cuddling.</p><p>The bed jostled at their feet.</p><p>\u201cOh God,\u201d Zane whispered.</p><p>Ty shushed him, holding his breath to keep still. They\u2019d been caught off guard, with no covers over their naked bodies. They were defenseless. Ty bent his leg until his knee was covering Zane\u2019s groin, but that was all the movement he was willing to risk as the bed jostled again.</p><p>Smith and Wesson had awoken.</p><p>The two fluffy orange cats were Ty\u2019s \u201ctemporary\u201d wards, but much to Zane\u2019s chagrin, they\u2019d been here for months now. They were exceptionally large and ill-tempered, and though they seemed to have developed a certain loyalty and affection for Ty, Zane insisted they were trying to kill him. Ty had never witnessed them doing anything spectacularly evil, but he would admit they pounced and hissed at Zane with unusual frequency. And if it was time for their breakfast, they weren\u2019t averse to biting the tip of Ty\u2019s nose and sinking their sharp little teeth into other sensitive areas.</p><p>Ty had a special interest in keeping Zane\u2019s tender spots unscathed, hence his knee over Zane\u2019s fun parts.</p><p>\u201cI thought you closed the door last night,\u201d Zane whispered.</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh Jesus. Can they open doors now?\u201d</p><p>Ty wouldn\u2019t have put it past these cats.</p><p>Zane\u2019s phone began to ring from the bedside table, but neither man dared to move.</p><p>Ty grunted as one of the cats began walking up his body, using his long claws to help him balance as he made his way to Ty\u2019s hip and plopped his fluffy butt down as if he\u2019d just staked a claim. Ty reached back and rubbed the cat\u2019s head, letting his fingers twirl the hair under his ear that Ty called his muttonchops. He knew it was Wesson just from the tenor of his purr.</p><p>\u201cGood kitty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you encourage them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re good kitties.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re your minions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone needs a minion or two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t be so pleased when you find me ground up in their food bowl one day.\u201d</p><p>Ty chuckled, trying not to shake too much.</p><p>They waited a few minutes to see if either cat was going to attack, and when it seemed they were safe, Ty rested his hand on Zane\u2019s chest again and closed his eyes. Zane turned his head with infinite care and kissed Ty\u2019s forehead.</p><p>Wesson gave him a warning growl.</p><p>\u201cMine,\u201d Zane told the cat.</p><p>Ty smiled and ran his fingers through the sparse hair on Zane\u2019s chest. Wesson growled again.</p><p>\u201cIf you make him attack me, I swear to God . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t mind-control the cats, Zane. Who called?\u201d</p><p>Zane reached out with the utmost care to grab his phone. He was silent as he checked the display, and Ty watched his profile with all the devotion of a lover. It wasn\u2019t hard to miss when Zane\u2019s jaw clenched and his body tensed.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my sister.\u201d</p><p>Ty tried to get a better look at Zane\u2019s eyes. He rarely spoke of his family, and Ty had always gotten the feeling it wasn\u2019t just the strain of living far away that kept Zane from them. He\u2019d never pushed, though, classing Zane\u2019s family in the same category as his deceased wife or his addictions. If Zane wanted to talk about it, he\u2019d bring it up.</p><p>\u201cGood or bad?\u201d Ty asked, rubbing his fingers over Zane\u2019s chest to soothe him. Smith chose that moment to come out of hiding, pouncing on his moving fingers and landing on Zane\u2019s chest. His claws sank in, turning the bed into a frenzy of cat fur, flying linens, and screaming FBI agents.</p><p>When the bloodshed was over, Zane had fled down the hall to the bathroom and shut the door to ward off any further attacks, leaving Ty to fend for himself. He laughed as he watched Smith and Wesson prowl down the hall, stalking Zane. They plopped down to stare at the bathroom door, tails twitching. It didn\u2019t matter what Zane did for them, or how many times he fed them or threw Ty in their path, they still hated him.</p><p>Maybe they were trying to kill him.</p><p>Ty pulled on a pair of pants and headed downstairs, stepping over the cats without being molested, laughing again as he heard Zane come out of the bathroom and yowl in pain. After a few thumps and curses, Smith and Wesson thundered down the stairs to swarm Ty\u2019s feet and wait for food.</p><p>\u201cGood kitties,\u201d Ty whispered to them. They were both purring so loudly it was impossible to hear Zane\u2019s movements upstairs, but a few minutes later, Ty glanced up when Zane came stomping down the steps. He had his phone to his ear.</p><p>\u201cHey, Annie,\u201d Zane said on the phone. He met Ty\u2019s eyes and smirked as he swiped a piece of toast from one of the plates Ty was arranging. Ty swatted at him with a spatula, but missed. \u201cNo, no, it\u2019s okay, I was up. What\u2019s going on?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Zane tensed as his sister spoke to him. Ty set the frying pan aside and watched his lover as an unsettling feeling started in his gut.</p><p>\u201cWhy the hell didn\u2019t you call me earlier?\u201d Zane blurted. \u201cDo I need to come out there?\u201d</p><p>Ty held his breath, straining his ears to hear. He couldn\u2019t make out any of Annie\u2019s words, but whatever she was saying was making Zane\u2019s nostrils flare and his shoulders snap back. Classic signs that Zane was about to delve into Dark Mode.</p> <p>Zane listened for a few more minutes, then bade his sister good-bye and hung up. He looked at Ty with wide eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou okay? What happened?\u201d</p><p>Zane didn\u2019t answer immediately. When he did speak, Ty knew he was whitewashing whatever he\u2019d just learned. \u201cAnnie said they\u2019re having trouble on the ranch. Trespassers. They think maybe it\u2019s poachers or rival breeders after the horse stock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Ty said, confused about why that would warrant a call to Zane. As far as he knew, Zane had little contact with his family. Even his sister, who Zane got on well with, rarely called just to chat. \u201cSo, what, you need to go down there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I mean no. No, they don\u2019t need me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen why\u2019d they call you?\u201d</p><p>Zane waved his hand. \u201cI don\u2019t know, Ty. I can\u2019t help, so there\u2019s no point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you need to go, we can figure something out at work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>Ty arched an eyebrow. \u201cWow.\u201d</p><p>Zane shook his head, although he looked conflicted and more than a little annoyed that Ty hadn\u2019t just let it go. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. If it\u2019s still a problem when the weekend hits, I\u2019ll head down there.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, can we drop it now?\u201d</p><p>Ty nodded and watched with a frown as Zane headed back upstairs. He stopped halfway up, then turned and thumped back down.</p><p>\u201cForgot what I was doing,\u201d he mumbled. He snatched another piece of toast before Ty could stop him.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Zane said as he went back up the steps, taking them two at a time.</p><p>Ty watched him go, frown in place. Despite seeming to shrug it off, he knew Zane was worried. Whatever was going on in Texas, it was so much more than a few trespassers.</p><p>Ty jumped at the sound of a file folder hitting a box on the floor. He glanced up at Special Agent Scott Alston, who ignored the file when it skidded off the top of the stack to thump to the industrial-grade carpet. Alston leaned back in his chair as he loosened his tie, and then stuck his hands behind his head and closed his eyes.</p> <p>Their whole work group had been tasked with slogging through a load of files sent over from one of the other investigative teams, desperate to dredge up evidence on a case that was going colder by the day. There were literally hundreds of files, and the six of them were on their last hour before they could break for the weekend.</p><p>\u201cGarrett, are you getting off on all this paperwork?\u201d Alston asked.</p><p>\u201cZane went to the bathroom like five minutes ago, Scott,\u201d Ty said. His words were marred by the yellow highlighter between his teeth. Both hands were full of papers, held aloft as he planted his elbows on his desk.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Alston said, running his fingers through his blond hair. Ty felt like Alston looked: exhausted, seeing double, and desperate to go home.</p><p>\u201cThank God it\u2019s Friday,\u201d Alston said on a deep sigh as he looked at the clock. Ty glanced at it too, out of habit. Close to quitting time.</p><p>His cell phone began to buzz at his hip, and he twisted to try to see the display. He had no free hands, and no free space on his desk to set one of the unorganized stacks down.</p><p>\u201cWant me to get it?\u201d Alston asked. He pushed out of his chair, and Ty nodded and stood as well, turning his hip toward Alston.</p><p>He spit the highlighter out. It clattered to the desk and rolled until it hit a stack of files too high to bounce over. Alston plucked the phone off his belt and hit the speaker button.</p><p>\u201cGrady,\u201d Ty said as Alston put the phone on the desk and took one of the stacks of papers from his hand. \u201cThanks,\u201d Ty whispered.</p><p>\u201cTy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Ma,\u201d Ty said, distracted as he and Alston tried to switch things around while still keeping the stacks in order.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not still at work, are you? I can call back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m about done here.\u201d Ty glanced up at Alston and waved a handful of files at the shredder nearby. Alston shook his head, and Ty nodded in response, managing to start an argument without a single word.</p><p>On the other side of the pod of desks, Michelle Clancy began to giggle.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Ty asked his mother as he sat down and leaned closer to the cell phone, struggling to finish up his last file and listen at the same time.</p><p>\u201cWell, I need a favor. A few favors, actually. But they can wait \u2019til you get home and call me back.\u201d</p><p>Ty rolled his eyes and shook his head. Alston chuckled as he leaned against Ty\u2019s desk. \u201cMa, will you just get to the point, please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we\u2019re aiming to fix the old tin roof on the storage shed this weekend \u2019cause it\u2019s leaking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God,\u201d Ty groaned. He lowered his head, files forgotten. Alston squeezed his shoulder, mockingly comforting him.</p><p>\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t need your help normally, but this morning I cut your daddy\u2019s finger off, and he says he can\u2019t hold a hammer.\u201d</p><p>Ty\u2019s head shot up. \u201cYou what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCut his finger off,\u201d Mara said again, as if she hadn\u2019t realized the news would be shocking.</p><p>The others were drifting closer, trying to hear the conversation. Ty sat silent a moment longer, his mouth agape. \u201cOn . . . purpose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, no, it was an accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, of course.\u201d He glanced up at his teammates to see all four of them watching and laughing.</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s not like he don\u2019t have four more fingers to work with. And it was only part of the little finger, and they sewed it back on. He has two hands, one of \u2019em can hold a hammer just fine, but no, he says he can\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yeah. Like I said, they sewed it back on. So can you come home this weekend and help out with the roof tomorrow? Deacon said he would come too, but you know how he gets with tools.\u201d</p><p>Ty shook his head, mouth still hanging open as he tried to process. Clancy leaned over to catch his eye, even waving a hand at him. \u201cHi, Mama Grady! Ty\u2019s checking his calendar to see if he can get away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you lie to me, honey. He\u2019s sitting there with his mouth hanging open, ain\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTy, if you come tonight, I\u2019ll get your daddy to tell you all about it. Your brother and Livi\u2019ll be here. It\u2019ll be fun!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFun does not start with a story about how you cut Dad\u2019s finger off!\u201d Ty said, laughing despite himself.</p><p>\u201cIt does in my book. He deserved it.\u201d</p><p>The others gave up on etiquette and laughed raucously. Ty shot them all a glare, and he finally dropped what he was doing and picked up his phone. He caught sight of Zane coming back down the hall. His partner had been sullen and distracted for the last day or two, and though he knew Zane was having issues over that call from Texas, he had his own problems to deal with now. He spun around in his chair to put his back to his coworkers, trying to turn the speaker off.</p><p>\u201cDoes it have to be this weekend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney, if you can\u2019t come help, that\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>Ty rolled his eyes and rubbed a hand across his forehead. \u201cOkay, Ma. I\u2019ll leave after work and be there . . . I don\u2019t know, a little before midnight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReverse psychology,\u201d Fred Perrimore whispered.</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s where Ty learned it,\u201d Harry Lassiter said under his breath.</p><p>Mara either couldn\u2019t hear them over the speaker that wouldn\u2019t shut off or ignored them. \u201cI\u2019ll have pork chops waiting! And honey, will you bring that big sharp knife of yours with you? Your daddy\u2019s is awful dull, and the whetstone went missing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d Ty said with trepidation.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you tonight! Bye-bye!\u201d Mara said, then ended the call without waiting for more.</p><p>Ty stared at the phone as the display lit up, and then he looked at the others, who were all trying to keep straight faces.</p><p>\u201cCan we come?\u201d Alston said, grinning widely.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll help!\u201d Clancy said.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpoilsport,\u201d Perrimore muttered, and they all drifted away to leave Ty to finish his paperwork.</p><p>Zane sat against the edge of Ty\u2019s desk, in the same place Alston had occupied. He was frowning and seemed distracted, but that was nothing new. He was just close enough that Ty could have used his knee as an armrest, and though the thought hadn\u2019t crossed his mind when Alston had been sitting there, he almost did it now without thinking. He stopped himself just in time, making it look like a frustrated flop of his hand.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t the first time they\u2019d come close to getting too friendly in front of their coworkers, and it was happening more frequently. He didn\u2019t know how to address the problem, or if he even wanted to.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d Zane asked.</p><p>Ty stared at him for a moment, trying to decide how to answer that simple question. He was still distracted by Zane\u2019s proximity, by the way he smelled, by how easy it was becoming to slip in front of coworkers who were trained to see mistakes.</p><p>He gave Zane the bare-bones version of his call from home, and after Zane had stopped laughing, Ty tapped him on the knee.</p><p>\u201cYou heard anything about Texas? You thinking about heading down there?\u201d</p><p>Zane shrugged, though his expression clouded over and he looked down at the carpet rather than meet Ty\u2019s eyes. \u201cI haven\u2019t had a call back. I don\u2019t see any reason to bother.\u201d</p><p>Ty sighed. He wanted to poke at that soft spot and see why it was there, and he added that to his list of shit to do. But he had some pretty pressing problems of his own to handle first. \u201cWant to go to West Virginia and risk life and limb with me?\u201d</p><p>Zane smirked and gave a single nod. \u201cSounds like fun.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>Ty shouldered his overnight bag and walked through muggy mountain air across the gravel and up the porch steps to his parents\u2019 house, stopping when he realized the rocking chair was occupied.</p><p>\u201cGrandpa?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an observant one, ain\u2019t you, boy?\u201d Chester Grady grumbled.</p><p>Ty smiled as he looked over his grandpa, sitting in his rocker, shovel in place over his lap. \u201cLove you too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn fool federal agent,\u201d Chester mumbled as the screen door squeaked. \u201cWhere\u2019s your damn fool partner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s getting his damn fool bag out of the truck.\u201d Ty slipped him a smuggled cigar as he bent to hug him. \u201cWhat are you still doing up? I thought you old folks went down with the sun.\u201d</p><p>Chester waved him off, grumbling and smirking. Headlights caught them as another car pulled up to the front of the house, and Chester\u2019s eyes shone with mischief.</p><p>Ty turned to watch Deuce get out of the car, squinting past the headlights.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Deuce called back, sounding just as tired as Ty felt. He thumped up the steps, carrying a small overnight bag just like Ty\u2019s. He greeted Chester with a hug, then turned to give Ty one as well. Ty hugged him tight. He nodded at the black Lexus in the driveway.</p><p>\u201cIs that a new car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe either,\u201d Deuce grunted with a curl of his lip. He turned toward the door.</p><p>Ty laughed as he followed. \u201cWhere\u2019s Livi?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMorning sickness. We figured it was best for everyone if she stayed home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Zane?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWearing his invisible suit,\u201d Zane called from the driveway. His shoes crunched on the gravel, and soon he materialized out of the darkness, joining them on the front porch with his bag.</p><p>They left Chester sitting on the porch and headed inside. Ty hadn\u2019t been home since he\u2019d been attacked by the mountain lion last fall, and he was surprised when a jitter of nerves ran through him. He\u2019d been sure someone would figure out that he and Zane were so much more than partners, that he was gay\u2014a revelation he\u2019d feared since he was seventeen. He still feared it, even though he\u2019d started wishing he could tell his family the truth. He would have to soon, before they found out on their own. Zane was too important to him to hide anymore.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t told his mother Zane was coming, and while he wasn\u2019t surprised that Deuce had inquired about his partner\u2019s whereabouts, it did strike him as odd that Chester had done the same. Maybe they were already starting to figure things out on their own.</p><p>He took a deep breath to calm himself.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>They heard footsteps from the back of the house, and soon Ty\u2019s mother came around the corner and smiled brilliantly. \u201cCome here and give your mama a hug before I have to go back outside.\u201d</p><p>Ty and Deuce moved toward her, hugging her obediently. She had to stand on her tiptoes to put her arms around their necks, and she squeezed them both tightly. Ty couldn\u2019t help but smile.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing outside this time of night?\u201d Deuce asked when he let her go.</p><p>\u201cZane,\u201d Mara demanded, ignoring Deuce\u2019s question and holding her arms out for a hug from Zane as well. Zane smiled and moved to obey. \u201cYou look better than the last time I saw you!\u201d She pulled away from him and held him by his shoulders, looking up at him with a critical eye. \u201cSuch a handsome boy,\u201d she said as she patted his cheek. She turned her eye to Ty again. \u201cYou could use some work. Come on.\u201d She turned and headed toward the back door. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ty huffed and followed. \u201cWhat are you doing outside so late?\u201d he repeated.</p><p>\u201cHelping your daddy,\u201d Mara shot over her shoulder.</p><p>Zane held out a hand toward Ty. \u201cWant me to take the bags upstairs?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. Wait, what? Hey, Ma!\u201d Ty trailed after his mother, bag still over his shoulder. \u201cWhat is he doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCutting up the four-by-fours we got for the roof.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh hell,\u201d Zane said under his breath as he followed the crazy train out the back door, reaching for the strap of Ty\u2019s bag. Ty shrugged it off with a glance back at Zane, but his attention was on his mother.</p><p>They thumped down the steps in the dark and followed Mara around the corner of the house, where a pole stood in the middle of the yard. In the pool of light at its base were several stacks of tin roofing, wooden planks, crates, and Earl Grady with a large electric saw.</p><p>\u201cEarl, the boys are here,\u201d Mara announced.</p> <p>\u201cBoys,\u201d Earl greeted without looking up.</p><p>\u201cHello, sir,\u201d Ty and Deuce responded at the same time.</p><p>\u201cDad?\u201d Ty knelt down so he could look his father in the eye.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t the whole finger,\u201d Earl said before Ty could even ask. He held up his hand and displayed the heavy wrapping that was keeping his reattached pinkie connected.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s dirty!\u201d Mara said. \u201cThat\u2019s it. We\u2019re going inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Mara\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat was the deal! Inside. Now!\u201d Mara shouted, pointing at the house.</p><p>\u201cHow did you cut off your finger?\u201d Deuce asked.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t cut off anything,\u201d Earl answered with a look at his wife.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll tell you when he gets inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Ma,\u201d Ty said, sounding almost exactly like Earl had a moment earlier.</p><p>\u201cInside!\u201d</p><p>Grumbling, Ty turned, and the procession tromped into the house. They headed for the living room, and Ty threw himself onto the couch. Zane sat next to him with a little more dignity, but Ty could tell he was tense. Zane and Earl hadn\u2019t hit it off the first time they\u2019d met.</p><p>Mara pointed for Earl to sit in the nearby recliner, and he did so without protest.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll get the disinfectant and the gauze,\u201d she announced as she left the room.</p><p>Deuce sat on the table in front of Earl, and he and Ty both watched their father out of the corner of their eyes, either trying to judge his mood or waiting for him to speak.</p><p>\u201cSo, Dad,\u201d Ty finally tried, drawing the words out as he turned his shoulders toward Earl.</p><p>\u201cIt was an accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI certainly hope so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be a smartass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t help it, runs in the family. What happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mother cut my finger off with a set of garden shears. That\u2019s what happened,\u201d Earl answered, his tone neutral. Although, he did manage to make the word \u201cmother\u201d sound like a curse.</p><p>\u201cDid you . . . deserve it?\u201d Deuce asked shakily. Either he was afraid of asking the question, or he was trying not to laugh. Ty was inclined to think the latter.</p><p>\u201cA little bit,\u201d Earl said. \u201cShe was out there pruning that big ol\u2019 gardenia bush, and I was trying to get the mulch under it just right as she did it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe told me to wait, that I was going to lose a finger.\u201d Earl looked toward the kitchen and then back at Ty and Deuce. He snorted. \u201cI asked her, did she think I was stupid? Then a couple snips later, whack. Off went the finger. And you know what that woman said to me? I said, \u2018Mara, you cut my finger off.\u2019 And your mother said to me, \u2018Well, Earl, who\u2019s stupid now?\u2019\u201d</p><p>Ty laughed out loud before he could stop himself. Deuce snorted and cleared his throat before giving up and grinning. Ty could picture the scene as if he had witnessed it himself, and he couldn\u2019t seem to stop giggling.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not really all that funny,\u201d Earl said, offended. Ty\u2019s only response was to lower his head into both hands and laugh more. The more Earl protested, the harder Ty laughed. Soon he fell to his side against Zane\u2019s arm and covered his face as he cackled.</p><p>\u201cIf it makes you feel better, Dad, we were worried,\u201d Deuce said, though his voice wavered.</p><p>\u201cYeah, he looks it,\u201d Earl said. He was watching Ty with what might have been affection, though.</p><p>\u201cHe does have personal experience with finger injuries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s \u2019cause he\u2019s a dumbass,\u201d Earl said.</p><p>Ty howled as he pointed at his father. \u201cThat must run in the family too!\u201d</p><p>Earl eased back into his chair and shook his head as Ty finally wound down and tried to catch his breath. \u201cGood thing it wasn\u2019t the whole hand. You\u2019d \u2019a\u2019 been in hysterics.\u201d</p><p>That caused another peal of laughter. Deuce bit his lip and looked away so Earl wouldn\u2019t see him grinning, and Ty could feel Zane chuckling against him.</p><p>Mara walked into the room carrying a basket of first aid gear and frowned at them. \u201cHe told you how it happened, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d Zane managed to say.</p><p>Ty cleared his throat and sat back up, fighting for a little decorum as he wiped at his eyes.</p><p>Mara sat down on the end of the couch near Earl and placed her basket on the floor, then gestured for Earl to give her his hand.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you let one of the boys do that?\u201d Earl suggested as he held his hand away from her.</p><p>\u201cYou think I can\u2019t doctor you after thirty-seven years of marriage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one that cut it off in the first place!\u201d</p><p>They were all still chuckling as they headed for the kitchen to eat the late dinner Mara had promised, leaving Mara and Earl to discuss things without an audience.</p><p>The building they were here to repair had served as storage for as long as Ty could remember. It had been built into a rocky outcropping on the property, using the side of the mountain as one of its walls. Because of that, it stayed cool almost year-round, but it also had a tendency toward being dark, damp, and full of creepy-crawlies. Ty mostly stayed away from it.</p><p>The other three walls were made of two-by-fours and sheet metal, with some scrap siding and cinder blocks to give it that tetanus feeling that kept strangers away from it and its contents.</p><p>Ty licked his lips as he examined the failing roof from the front of the building. The tin was rusted through in places, jagged and reddened and full of holes where rain and runoff from the hill had eaten through it. It was possible they could replace a few sheets of the corrugated tin, but more likely they\u2019d need to do the whole thing. The earthen portion of the building had insinuated itself into the structure over the years, and it would be a real bitch to get the tin of the roof out of the soil. It appeared they would have to dig into it.</p><p>Of course, if they were going to do it right, that\u2019s what they\u2019d have to do. Mara and Earl had other ideas.</p><p>\u201cI think if we just spread this tarp over it, it\u2019ll last a few more years,\u201d Mara said as she dropped the bundle of blue tarp she\u2019d hauled out of the back of her old SUV.</p><p>\u201cTarp?\u201d Deuce said with a frown.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like we live in it,\u201d Mara told him. \u201cIt\u2019ll keep it dry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, until the first snow,\u201d Ty said. \u201cThen you\u2019ll be calling me and Deuce, all, \u2018Honey, your daddy\u2019s buried under ten feet of snow, can you bring your shovel?\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I didn\u2019t drive from Philly to help you lay out a tarp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh hush, both of you,\u201d Mara said with a wave of her hand.</p><p>Earl and Chester both chuckled.</p><p>\u201cReally, Ma, you\u2019ve got all the stuff, you\u2019ve got us all here to help, why not just rebuild it now?\u201d Deuce said.</p><p>\u201cAll right, all right. Earl and Zane stay on the ground. Ty and Deacon can handle the stuff up top.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy does Zane get to stay on the ground?\u201d Ty asked with an accusatory point at his able-bodied partner.</p><p>\u201cBecause he\u2019s a guest, and we don\u2019t ask guests to risk life and limb.\u201d She thrust a hammer and a plastic container full of nails into Earl\u2019s arms. Then she clapped her hands. \u201cGet to it, boys. We\u2019re burning daylight! And when we take a break later, I\u2019ve got some furniture needs moving.\u201d</p><p>Ty and Deuce both groaned as they headed for the rocky slope acting as one of the building\u2019s walls. They\u2019d used the hill to access the roof many times in their youth, when they weren\u2019t supposed to be playing up there but had done so anyway. As Ty scrambled up the incline, it didn\u2019t seem as high as he remembered from when he was ten, but the roof looked much more foreboding.</p><p>\u201cAh, for the fearlessness of youth,\u201d Deuce muttered from the other side of the building. Ty snorted. They sat on the hill above the roof, fighting gravity and erosion as they tried to keep their weight off the perilous-looking tin.</p><p>\u201cJust keep to the two-by-fours and you shouldn\u2019t fall through,\u201d Mara called up to them.</p><p>Ty and Deuce shared a look.</p><p>\u201cMa, we can\u2019t see where the two-by-fours are from up here,\u201d Ty shouted as he looked over the roof. They could see spots that were rusted through, and others where it looked as if a leaf landing on the metal would cause it to give in.</p><p>\u201cThey should be where the nails are,\u201d Earl called back. \u201cJust step on the nails.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve got to be kidding,\u201d Deuce said under his breath.</p><p>Ty slid down the hill closer to the edge of the roof, dampness from the ground seeping into the seat of his jeans. He tapped the toe of his work boot on the nearest line of nails, testing it. \u201cLook at it this way,\u201d he told his brother. \u201cIt\u2019s only like an eight foot drop. And any of Dad\u2019s tools that are sharp enough to impale you are in the other shed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a ray of sunshine and optimism, you know that?\u201d</p><p>Deuce mimicked Ty\u2019s actions, testing the roof with one foot. They made their way out onto the tin, taking great care to stay on the line of nails that indicated the supporting beams below. \u201cSpeaking of optimism, how are things going with you and Zane?\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo good to be true,\u201d Ty said as he edged along the narrow line of safety.</p><p>\u201cDid you bring him with you for a reason?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop psychoanalyzing me,\u201d Ty said, sing-song, as he glanced up and then back down at the roof.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a yes,\u201d Deuce replied in the same tone.</p><p>\u201cMaybe it is, but as soon as I stepped through the door, I changed my mind.\u201d Ty continued toward the edge of the building, being less careful than he should have been. \u201cDad was right, I\u2019m a coward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit, Ty. You\u2019ll get there.\u201d</p><p>Ty glanced at his brother and nodded.</p><p>When he reached the edge, he knelt down and smiled crookedly at Zane, giving him a quick wink. Zane returned his smile. Ty almost got lost in it, but he was distracted by his father giving them orders.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re gonna tear the whole thing up and replace anything that\u2019s rotted,\u201d Earl said as he handed Ty a crowbar.</p><p>Ty and Deuce both groaned, but they followed with a matching, \u201cYes, sir.\u201d And then they got to work, yanking up the old tin roof and tossing the pieces down to the ground.</p><p>The faster they finished this disaster waiting to happen, the faster Ty could get down there to Zane and work himself up into confessing the truth to his family.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until they were washing up for dinner that Zane was able to get Ty alone, cornering him in the tiny bathroom upstairs. The first thing Zane did was pull Ty to him and kiss him, long and hard, letting Ty\u2019s scent and the feel of him wipe away all the tension he\u2019d built up in the past few days. He pulled Ty close, appreciating every ounce of him, letting himself be turned on by the smell of sweat and damp earth clinging to Ty\u2019s body.</p><p>When they parted, Zane\u2019s heart was pounding and Ty was trying to catch his breath.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking,\u201d Ty said as he pressed his nose to Zane\u2019s cheek.</p><p>\u201cNot your strong suit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, look who\u2019s funny,\u201d Ty said, though he was smiling against Zane\u2019s skin. He pulled back a step to meet Zane\u2019s eyes. \u201cI\u2019m serious. What would you think of telling my parents about us?\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s heart leapt into his throat. \u201cYou want to come out to your mom and dad?\u201d</p><p>Ty licked his lips and nodded. \u201cI want you to be part of the family. You deserve that. We deserve it.\u201d</p><p>Zane began to smile.</p><p>\u201cI just . . . I don\u2019t know how. I don\u2019t know if I have the guts to do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby, I think deciding you want to is a pretty big step. We\u2019ll figure it out.\u201d He kissed Ty languidly, breathless and distracted by the heat growing between them that wouldn\u2019t be addressed soon enough. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what a big deal that is. I know what you\u2019ve been through. Thank you for thinking I\u2019m worth it.\u201d</p><p>Ty stared at him for a long moment, then kissed him again, harder. They lingered over it, taking their time, letting themselves enjoy the brief moment.</p><p>\u201cYou better get cleaned up,\u201d Zane finally said as he pushed Ty away and headed for the door. He didn\u2019t look back. If he did, he and Ty would end up screwing in the shower, and that would be so very hard to explain.</p><p>He headed for the landing, meeting Deuce at the top of the stairs with a knowing grin and following him down to the kitchen. Ty wasn\u2019t far behind them. It was a glimpse into what it might have been like to grow up here, to have a family that was so close, a mother who hugged at every opportunity, a brother who was more like an accomplice than a sibling. It made Zane\u2019s stomach cramp to think of all the ways life could have been different. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ty sat next to him at the table and held his hand as they all bowed their heads to offer thanks for the meal. Zane squeezed his fingers, wanting nothing more than to be able to hold Ty\u2019s hand whenever they wanted. The fact that Ty had broached the subject of telling his family had warmed Zane\u2019s soul in ways he hadn\u2019t known he\u2019d needed. It might take time, but maybe they would get there sooner rather than later.</p><p>Zane dug into the delicious dinner, surrounded by warmth and laughter, feeling remarkably at home.</p><p>It was a good while later, with dessert on the table, that Mara cleared her throat and reached out to put her hand on Ty\u2019s forearm. \u201cBy the way, I told the minister and choirmaster you boys would be at the service in the morning.\u201d</p> <p>Deuce and Ty groaned in unison.</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019d get to hear you sing,\u201d Zane said, perking up. \u201cSomething besides the national anthem and the Battle Hymn.\u201d</p><p>Ty growled at him, then looked at his mother. \u201cThey have a perfectly good choir. I\u2019m sure they don\u2019t need us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with him?\u201d Deuce asked with a jerk of his thumb at Earl. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t sing with his fingers.\u201d</p><p>Mara narrowed her eyes at them both.</p> <p>\u201cOkay, okay,\u201d Ty conceded, holding up both hands. \u201cWe\u2019ll sing.\u201d</p><p>Deuce grumbled but didn\u2019t argue. The brothers locked eyes and seemed to communicate silently, devising a way out of it. Mara was too pleased to notice.</p><p>\u201cAs long as Dad sings with us,\u201d Ty added with a shit-eating grin at his father.</p><p>Earl rolled his eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhatever it takes,\u201d Mara said. She stood and went to the refrigerator. \u201cAll of you shitheads need Jesus so far as I\u2019m concerned.\u201d</p><p>Zane almost choked on his tea.</p> <p>\u201cThat includes you,\u201d Mara told him. She sat back down with a dish of whipped cream, and Zane waved a hand in acknowledgment as he tried to clear his throat.</p><p>Ty was laughing beside him. He patted Zane\u2019s knee under the table and squeezed, resting his hand there. Zane\u2019s eyes were watering, and his cheeks were warm with a shade of embarrassment, but it was okay. Par for the course with the Gradys.</p><p>After dinner, everyone gathered in the living room for coffee. Zane sat on one end of the couch, his long legs stretched out in front of him. The weather had turned drizzly toward the end of the afternoon and dropped the temperature a little low, even for late June in the mountains. The windows were open, letting in the breeze and the scent of rain.</p><p>It was a pretty scene, homey and comfortable. For all that the Gradys had bickered over the construction of the new roof and made fun during dinner, they seemed to enjoy the verbal battles, and there was no tension or malice in the air. Zane could feel weariness encroaching as the breeze and familiar scents seeped into him.</p><p>He sat slouched with one arm outstretched off the end of the couch, his fingertip brushing a little cut-glass figurine on the table. It reflected the light as he nudged it, watching it sparkle.</p><p>Ty sat on the floor, leaning back against the couch and looking exhausted. Deuce lounged on the other end of the sofa, his feet up on a stool in front of him. Earl and Mara sat on the loveseat across the room. They cuddled together, Mara curled in the crook of Earl\u2019s arm draped over the back of the loveseat. For a couple who\u2019d been together so long and seemed to lack any sentimentality about their marriage, it was an oddly sweet thing. Zane had never seen his parents cuddling.</p><p>Deuce groaned. \u201cMa, what sort of pie was that?\u201d He was rubbing his stomach.</p><p>\u201cBitter cherry. Lucy Hopewell had one at the potluck a week back, and I thought I might try it. It wasn\u2019t good?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt was good, Ma,\u201d Ty said, voice flat.</p><p>\u201cWhere do you get bitter cherries?\u201d Deuce asked.</p><p>\u201cDisgruntled trees,\u201d Ty said. He looked over his shoulder with a smirk.</p><p>Earl barked a laugh and Mara gave a surprised giggle. Zane studiously kept his eyes on the figurine, biting his lip as laughter shook through him.</p><p>Deuce glared at Ty, but Ty returned the look with wide-eyed innocence. \u201cMaybe they need a shrink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate you.\u201d</p><p>Chester cackled and shook his head. He rocked in his chair, facing the couch from the other side of the fireplace, drinking from a mason jar of clear liquid that Ty had implied was some incredible moonshine. He watched the glass figurine as Zane played with it.</p><p>\u201cI gave that to my wife on our fiftieth Christmas together,\u201d he announced, looking at the little angel with a melancholy fondness.</p><p>Zane let his head fall to the side as he watched the light play off the glass. \u201cI bet she loved it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe did love a shiny thing, my Evie,\u201d Chester said with a smile.</p><p>Earl and Mara both laughed.</p><p>\u201cWe made it sixty-three years.\u201d Chester raised one gnarled finger and pointed at Zane. \u201cTakes a whole lot of shiny things.\u201d</p><p>Zane raised an eyebrow, but smiled, and his eyes strayed to the compass pendant around Ty\u2019s neck. \u201cKeeping anything worthwhile generally does,\u201d he agreed, looking back at the figurine, his eyes skimming over Ty along the way.</p><p>Ty wasn\u2019t looking at him, though. He was sitting with his arms around his knees to keep his balance as he rocked from side to side, staring at the rug in the middle of the floor. It was possible he\u2019d already zoned out and wasn\u2019t listening, but Zane doubted that very much.</p><p>\u201cGot to find the right fit,\u201d Chester continued. He waved a hand at Mara and Earl, who were watching him in bemusement. Then he looked back at Zane and pointed at him, waving his hand toward Ty to include him. \u201cIt\u2019s good you got the right fit.\u201d</p><p>Zane wasn\u2019t quite sure what that was supposed to mean, but he figured he should just be glad that he wasn\u2019t at the top of the shovel list anymore.</p><p>\u201cWell, somebody\u2019s got to watch his back,\u201d Zane said, glancing at his partner.</p><p>\u201cThat too,\u201d Chester said as he began rocking again, hands folded in his lap.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about, Dad?\u201d Earl asked Chester with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cAll\u2019s I\u2019m saying is love\u2019s a blessing, no matter all the same.\u201d</p><p>Ty\u2019s head shot up, and he stared at his grandfather for a moment before looking over his shoulder at Deuce. Deuce shook his head and mouthed something to him, assuring him he\u2019d never told anyone.</p><p>Zane forced himself not to move, not even to twitch as he blinked at Chester. It was an implication the old man couldn\u2019t possibly mean. Nerves started cramping his stomach.</p><p>Earl and Mara both stared at Chester, looking confused. But then, Chester probably got that look a lot. Chester rocked on for several tense moments before looking around at them all in surprise. \u201cWhat?\u201d he asked. \u201cY\u2019all didn\u2019t know they was sweethearts?\u201d</p><p>Zane was so shocked he knew it had to show as he stared at the smile on Chester\u2019s lined face. Distantly he thought he ought to be preparing something to say, but he\u2019d gone blank. His eyes searched out Ty\u2019s.</p><p>Ty wore much the same expression as he stared at Chester. He opened his mouth to speak and looked over to the loveseat, where Earl was looking at Chester intently.</p><p>\u201cDo what, now?\u201d Earl asked.</p><p>\u201cDad,\u201d Ty said as he struggled to his feet.</p><p>Earl stood to face him, shaking off Mara\u2019s hand as she tried to tug him back down. Zane sat up straight, though he stayed on the couch. Every warning instinct in him was firing.</p><p>\u201cIs that true?\u201d Earl demanded, voice low and deceptively calm.</p><p>Ty put up a hand and stepped toward him. \u201cLet\u2019s sit back down and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it true?\u201d Earl ground out again, not budging. Mara stood and took a tiny step closer, still looking thunderstruck.</p><p>Ty stared at his father, his lips parted. The hand at his side was trembling. Zane curled his fists in the couch cushions as he made himself sit still. He wanted desperately to go to Ty for support, to stand beside him in this moment. It tore him up to know he had to try to stay out of it.</p><p>Ty didn\u2019t look away from Earl; he swallowed hard and raised his chin. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Zane felt Deuce shift on the sofa next to him, but no one else moved or made a sound. Mara finally raised her hand to her mouth, her eyes riveted on Ty.</p><p>Earl continued to stare at him. \u201cHow long?\u201d he asked in the same dangerous tone. It seemed like an odd question to follow up the first with. Ty shook his head, apparently thinking the same thing and not certain how to answer. \u201cHow long have you known you were gay?\u201d Earl shouted.</p><p>Ty flinched, but he didn\u2019t back away. He opened his mouth to answer, but couldn\u2019t.</p><p>Zane\u2019s heart ached for him. He\u2019d never seen that look in Ty\u2019s eyes. He wanted to reach out and give Ty a hand, help him get the words out, stand between them to shield Ty from something he knew his lover had dreaded for half his life.</p><p>Ty swallowed hard and tried again. He sounded remarkably steady as he said, \u201cSenior year.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d barely gotten the words out when Earl backhanded him. Zane leapt to his feet as Mara screamed, but Deuce stepped over to stop him with one arm across his chest. Mara grabbed Earl\u2019s arm to keep him from swinging it again, but Earl didn\u2019t make another move toward Ty. He actually looked surprised that he\u2019d taken a swing at his son.</p><p>\u201cLeave them to it,\u201d Deuce whispered as he held Zane back. He was watching them like a hawk, though, clearly ready to move in himself if things got uglier.</p><p>Ty had his head bowed to the side and his eyes closed, motionless after the slap. Then he touched the side of his thumb to the corner of his mouth and looked back at his father as he wiped at his lip.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s for running,\u201d Earl said, his words unsteady.</p><p>Ty stared at him, his fingers trembling. Earl had put the whole story together with remarkable speed: That Ty had joined the Marines out of high school to leave home, to run from his family and the truth. That this was the secret that had taken his son from him.</p><p>Ty let out a measured breath, nodding as he did so. His eyes never left his father\u2019s. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>It was killing Zane to stand aside and watch the tension in Ty. Deuce patted his shoulder but didn\u2019t let go; he knew how Zane reacted to threats to Ty. He wasn\u2019t taking any chances on an all-out family brawl.</p><p>Earl moved again and pulled Ty into a hug, squeezing. Ty tensed, but after a second he put his chin down on his father\u2019s shoulder and closed his eyes in relief, returning the fierce embrace.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, boy,\u201d Earl whispered, just loud enough for the rest of them to hear. He patted the back of Ty\u2019s head with his bandaged hand.</p><p>Deuce loosened his hold on Zane, and Zane closed his eyes for a moment. Ty had wanted to tell them the truth, but Zane doubted this was how he\u2019d imagined it going.</p><p>When he looked up again, Earl had released Ty and was patting him on the cheek, talking to him quietly. Ty was nodding in a quick, jerky motion, his lips pressed into a thin line like they always were when he was trying to restrain emotion.</p><p>Earl had one more word for him and then stepped back. \u201cOkay, son, now take your shot,\u201d he invited as he opened his arms.</p><p>\u201cEarl,\u201d Mara warned.</p><p>\u201cI got mine, Mara; now he gets his. Take your shot, Beaumont.\u201d</p><p>Before Mara could protest again, Ty reared back and hit his father with a wicked right hook that knocked Earl off his feet. Earl struck the floor hard enough to make the plate of cookies on the table rattle, and Ty immediately doubled over, holding his hand and cussing.</p><p>\u201cNice hook, Tyler!\u201d Chester cried triumphantly. \u201cWoo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ, boy!\u201d Earl shouted as he clutched at his nose and wallowed on the floor.</p><p>\u201cWhat is your face made of, Dad, steel?\u201d Ty cried as he held his hand. \u201cOh my God!\u201d</p><p>He turned and stumbled into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cShould have seen that coming,\u201d Deuce muttered.</p><p>Zane cursed and followed his partner, unwilling to stay away any longer. What he really wanted was his own shot at Earl.</p><p>Ty was rummaging through the freezer, a bag of frozen peas already on his hand as he pulled out another bag. He let the freezer door swing shut as he stepped away and looked at Zane, his hazel eyes wide with the remnants of stark terror. He was shaking from head to toe.</p><p>\u201cBaby,\u201d Zane said as he took a few steps toward Ty. All of his possessive and protective instincts were in overdrive, but he held himself back, reaching out to check Ty\u2019s hand instead of wrapping him up in his arms and holding him until he stopped trembling. When Ty was upset, the last thing he wanted was to be restrained in any way.</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t exactly how I saw that going,\u201d Ty said. He reached out and pulled Zane closer, wrapping his arms around his neck and holding onto him.</p><p>Zane returned the fierce hug, his heart aching for Ty. Fear of what\u2019d just happened had been the driving force behind many of Ty\u2019s decisions and life choices. To have faced it in a moment not of his own choosing must\u2019ve been terrifying. Zane held him, letting Ty hang onto him, cheek pressed to Ty\u2019s while a long minute passed.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Mara said from the doorway.</p><p>Ty pulled away and glanced sheepishly at her. She stood behind Zane, arms crossed over her chest.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Dad\u2019s face?\u201d Ty asked.</p><p>\u201cBetter than yours is going to be if I find out you been keeping any more secrets,\u201d she threatened, putting her hands on her hips. She looked from him to Zane and back. \u201cIs it serious, the two of you?\u201d</p><p>It took Ty a moment to answer, but when he found his voice, he said, \u201cVery.\u201d</p><p>Mara narrowed her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI love him,\u201d Ty said, voice firm.</p><p>Mara just nodded, looking between them again. Her expression softened and she made a disgruntled noise, then she walked up to Zane and pulled him by his shoulders into a tight hug. Though he was surprised, he let her do what she wanted. She patted his back and kissed his cheek. \u201cWelcome to the family, Zane,\u201d she said, and the sincerity in her voice made his throat tighten. \u201cI wish I\u2019d known earlier, but if wishes was dollars, I\u2019d be the Queen of Sheba.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Zane straightened and glanced at Ty, who was staring at Mara, his hazel eyes wide and his mouth hanging open.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Zane said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need for that.\u201d She nodded and turned to Ty, hugging him in the same manner. \u201cYou should\u2019ve told us way back then,\u201d she said, her voice harsh with upset. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to leave.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d Ty whispered as he hugged her.</p><p>She stepped back, taking his chin in her hand and turning his head to the side. \u201cIs that hand broke?\u201d she asked after she\u2019d assured herself his face was okay.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, serves you both right.\u201d She took a bag of frozen broccoli from Ty and turned to leave. \u201cMule-headed, the both of you.\u201d</p><p>Zane sighed and lifted the bag off Ty\u2019s hand to examine his knuckles. \u201cDoesn\u2019t look too good,\u201d he said, lowering the bag back into place over the injury. He touched Ty\u2019s cheek, checking it for signs of redness, and tried to look at his eyes to make sure the fear was subsiding.</p> <p>Ty was still shaken, but considering how terribly it could have gone, that wasn\u2019t surprising. His parents were angrier about the fact that Ty had never told them why he\u2019d chosen to leave home right after high school, rather than the fact that he was gay. That was a promising step. A big one.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m going to throw up,\u201d Ty groaned, closing his eyes and breathing deeply. Then he met Zane\u2019s eyes and appeared to calm. After another moment, he seemed almost back to normal. \u201cThey\u2019re right, you know. I should have done that fifteen years ago.\u201d He took Zane\u2019s hand in his. \u201cThank you for . . . letting it play out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank Deuce.\u201d Zane glanced over his shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m not sure it\u2019s a good idea I go back in there with Earl right now. I don\u2019t think you hit him hard enough.\u201d</p><p>Ty turned his face into Zane\u2019s and nodded. \u201cCome on. We have to, sooner or later.\u201d He didn\u2019t let go of Zane\u2019s hand as he pulled him toward the living room. Zane let the mild surprise buoy him.</p><p>Chester was still rocking merrily, either pleased with himself for the commotion or oblivious to the fact that he\u2019d caused it. Deuce was sitting on the sofa with his head in his hands. Earl was still on the floor as Mara perched on the loveseat and pressed the frozen broccoli to the side of his face.</p><p>\u201cThat is one hell of a hook, son,\u201d Earl said to Ty as soon as they appeared.</p> <p>\u201cThank you, sir.\u201d Ty held up their linked hands as everyone in the room watched them. \u201cIs this a problem for anyone?\u201d</p><p>Deuce smiled, a hint of pride in his expression as he looked over at them. Mara shook her head, though her eyes seemed to be misting over. She was upset and probably would be for a while, but Zane was confident that it had nothing to do with their relationship and everything to do with the secrets Ty had been keeping and the years they\u2019d lost because of it.</p><p>Earl took the broccoli from her and struggled to his feet, wavering. He waited a moment, and then walked over to them. He looked from Ty to Zane and shook his head. \u201cDon\u2019t matter who you love, son,\u201d he said. \u201cAs long as you do it well.\u201d Then he held his hand out to Zane.</p><p>Zane looked at it, wondering if he could just not take it. But when Ty\u2019s hand loosened in his and let go, he reached out and shook Earl\u2019s, meeting the older man\u2019s eyes, letting his expression say what he couldn\u2019t. Earl nodded in acknowledgment of the uneasy peace. Then he moved away again, pressing the peas to his face and mumbling more about Ty\u2019s impressive right hook.</p><p>In the rocking chair, Chester began to hum. It wasn\u2019t a song yet, merely a cadence with a certain familiar ring to it. It was one of the songs Ty whistled and sometimes made up his own words to: \u201cWhen Johnny Comes Marching Home.\u201d</p><p>Chester began to laugh, rocking by the fireside with his shovel in his lap.</p><p>Ty bit his lip and glanced at Zane, trying not to smile. Zane rolled his eyes. \u201cGalloping crazies.\u201d</p><p>Ty squeezed his hand. \u201cWell, you said you liked horses.\u201d</p> <p>Ty sat on the edge of his old bed, looking down at the cast on his hand in the soft light of the bedside lamp. In all the times he\u2019d thrown a punch in his life, he\u2019d rarely broken one of his own bones in the process. It was a metacarpal this time, one of the bones within his hand. And it hurt like a bitch. His entire wrist had to be immobilized, hence the bright green cast on his arm.</p><p>It was a common fistfight injury, but Ty still couldn\u2019t believe his dad\u2019s jaw had broken his hand.</p><p>\u201cFigures the old man would break my hand,\u201d he grumbled.</p><p>Zane was behind him, leaning against the headboard. \u201cI\u2019m going to start calling you Tytanium.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s clever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it hurt that bad to hit me?\u201d Ty asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Ty said, mollified as he looked back down at the cast and plucked at the loose cotton on the edge. He knew Zane wasn\u2019t happy, but he wasn\u2019t sure what he could do about it. He glanced over his shoulder again. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of funny.\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s eyes were dark and his face was expressionless, but one corner of his mouth curled up. \u201cWhy is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, come on. The one time I take a swing at him, and he still comes out better than I do? There\u2019s funny in that. Like Charlie Brown with the football.\u201d</p><p>Zane smiled a little and rolled his eyes. He reached up to touch Ty, sliding his fingers along the base of his skull into his hair.</p><p>Ty leaned back into the touch, closing his eyes as relief washed over him. He couldn\u2019t shake the sense of impending doom that was always under the surface, but he\u2019d learned to live with it. The only things that mattered were that Zane was here with him and his parents had taken the news infinitely better than he\u2019d ever imagined.</p><p>They had every right to be pissed at him, not only for lying to them, but also for running. He turned and crawled toward Zane, stretching out to lay his head in Zane\u2019s lap.</p><p>\u201cI always thought there\u2019d be this huge weight lifted off my chest after they found out.\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s hand moved to stroke through Ty\u2019s hair. \u201cYou\u2019ve been carrying that weight a long time, Ty. It\u2019ll take a while not to feel it as much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you\u2019re right.\u201d He looked at Zane, reaching up to touch his face. \u201cTalk to me, darlin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Zane smiled. \u201cI love the way you say that.\u201d His fingers drifted across Ty\u2019s forehead. \u201cWhat do you want me to talk about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be dense. What do you think about all this?\u201d</p><p>Zane looked down at the quilt for a long moment, his lips compressing. \u201cI\u2019m angry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you are,\u201d Ty said gently. \u201cTalk to me about it instead of taking it out on me later.\u201d</p><p>Zane huffed, but they both knew it was valid. \u201cI\u2019ve never liked the relationship you have with your dad. It\u2019s always seemed to me he was more a gunny than a father. But it\u2019s not my place, you know? To criticize him.\u201d Zane paused. \u201cBut watching him hurt you? That\u2019s unacceptable to me. Possibly unforgivable.\u201d</p><p>Ty nodded. He knew that his relationship with his father, outwardly, hit all of Zane\u2019s hot buttons. But Earl was a good father; he had nothing but happy memories of growing up. Maybe Earl was more of a gunny than a dad, but it had worked. Sure, there was strain there, but he\u2019d challenge anyone to show him a perfect relationship between father and son. Tonight had been the first time Earl had ever raised a hand to one of his boys.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s . . . complicated,\u201d he offered, even knowing it would sound weak to Zane\u2019s ears.</p><p>Zane\u2019s brow creased, but his anger was mixed with dismay as he spoke. \u201cBut you\u2019re afraid of him, Ty. How can that be right?\u201d</p><p>Ty sat up, looking at Zane in surprise. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of him.\u201d But there were things that made him almost ill to think of: Knowing he might have disappointed his father. Seeing shame or contempt or any number of other reactions he\u2019d imagined when he let his father down. That all added up to making Ty tense when he thought too hard about it. All he\u2019d ever wanted was to make Earl proud of him; he\u2019d spent thirty years trying. \u201cAnd at the same time I am terrified of him,\u201d he realized as he looked at the USMC signet ring on his finger.</p><p>Zane shrugged helplessly. \u201cI don\u2019t know what . . . to do. It tears me up to see you dealing with this, and I can\u2019t help.\u201d</p><p>Ty sighed and turned to sit cross-legged on the bed beside Zane\u2019s hip. \u201cHe\u2019s my dad, Zane. I don\u2019t need you to do anything. You don\u2019t have to protect me. You don\u2019t have to defend me\u2014or us\u2014to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t just not feel the need to protect you, Ty. That\u2019s not going to happen. You\u2019d probably better not expect us to ever be much in the way of friends.\u201d</p><p>Ty smiled and patted Zane\u2019s knee. \u201cDad can take care of himself. You don\u2019t have to be buddies.\u201d</p><p>Zane gave an unconvincing nod.</p><p>Ty turned himself around to lay his head back in Zane\u2019s lap. \u201cHe\u2019s been angry with me for a long time. They never could understand why I left. And I could never tell them, not really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes telling doesn\u2019t help,\u201d Zane said. After a pause, he added, \u201cI told Mother what a great opportunity the FBI would be for me, and to this day she just can\u2019t, or won\u2019t, understand why I left home.\u201d</p><p>Ty looked up at him, trying to see his eyes. \u201cWhat happened with your family, Zane?\u201d</p><p>Zane answered with a heavy sigh. \u201cMy family wasn\u2019t like yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why you left Texas and never looked back?\u201d</p><p>Zane was quiet for a moment. \u201cI wasn\u2019t willing to do the job I was born for. I wasn\u2019t wanted there unless I intended to take over the ranch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cZane. I doubt that\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know them, Ty. My sister and my dad are good people, but Mother . . . she scares me. I hate being around her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause . . . I have a hard time finding anything I like about her, and she reminds me of me.\u201d</p><p>Ty sat up to look at him. He had his eyes closed, jaw clenched. Ty grabbed a fistful of his shirt and pulled him up to sit, then took Zane\u2019s chin in his hand and forced Zane to look at him. \u201cZane . . . you cannot possibly tell me that there is another one of you anywhere.\u201d</p><p>Zane gave a weak laugh and wrapped his arms around Ty. Ty turned his face into Zane\u2019s and held him close.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Zane. Even if you are obnoxious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an ass.\u201d</p><p>Ty smirked and turned his head for a kiss. A knock at the door interrupted them, and Ty sighed. \u201cYeah?\u201d he called. Zane let his arms drop so he wasn\u2019t holding Ty, but he didn\u2019t scoot away.</p><p>The door opened with a creak, and Deuce poked his head in. \u201cJust wanted to see how you were doing. You okay?\u201d</p><p>Ty nodded.</p><p>\u201cI slipped some . . . surprises in the tea after y\u2019all left. Ma and Dad should both sleep \u2019til noon. I might have killed Grandpa, we\u2019ll see in the morning.\u201d</p><p>Ty laughed. \u201cThank you, Deacon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeast I can do for my big brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow were they after we left?\u201d Zane asked. He and Ty had gone to the ER to get Ty\u2019s hand taken care of and hadn\u2019t seen anyone when they\u2019d gotten back.</p><p>Deuce pursed his lips. \u201cMa\u2019s been crying. She kept saying if she\u2019d only known, she\u2019d have stopped you from leaving.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cDad, I can\u2019t read.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking Dad will be easier to handle in the long run,\u201d Ty said to Deuce, who nodded in agreement. Zane gave Ty a look that said he didn\u2019t believe it, but he didn\u2019t voice an opinion.</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d Deuce smiled as he moved into the room. Ty stood when he got closer. \u201cI\u2019m proud of you. Both of you. Even if it wasn\u2019t your doing to begin with, you did it nonetheless.\u201d</p><p>Ty nodded jerkily, surprised by his reaction to his brother\u2019s words. Emotions welled in him that he didn\u2019t think he was ready for.</p><p>Deuce wrapped him up in a hug, his eyes squeezed shut, and when he spoke to Ty in a low whisper, his voice wavered. \u201cYou\u2019ll always be my hero, Beaumont.\u201d</p><p>Ty gave a choked laugh and patted the back of Deuce\u2019s head. Deuce pulled away and cleared his throat, his eyes misting. He stepped over to give Zane a hug as well, and Ty had to turn away to wipe at his eyes with the back of his sleeve.</p><p>\u201cHow the hell did Chester come up with that?\u201d Zane asked.</p><p>Deuce laughed and Ty just shook his head, scanning all the photos lining the walls of his old room as he wiped his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to ask Grandpa that,\u201d Deuce told Zane. \u201cLord only knows what he sees when people forget he\u2019s there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still think he uses that hearing aid as a listening device,\u201d Ty muttered.</p><p>Deuce laughed and smiled at them both. \u201cYou guys okay? Feels kind of heavy in here.\u201d</p><p>Ty nodded and glanced at Zane, who shrugged.</p><p>\u201cSomething happen I need to know about?\u201d Deuce asked.</p><p>\u201cZane has mommy issues.\u201d</p><p>Zane reached out and thumped Ty on the arm, hard.</p><p>\u201cInteresting,\u201d Deuce said, cocking his head at Zane. He looked like a bird of prey preparing to swoop in.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not. I\u2019m just coming to the realization that my mother is a bitch.\u201d</p><p>Deuce raised an eyebrow. \u201cInteresting.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t start,\u201d Zane growled.</p><p>Deuce glanced between them. \u201cWell, I\u2019m here if you need to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Deuce.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd if you need it, I\u2019ve got more goodies in my doctor bag.\u201d</p><p>Ty smirked. \u201cDeacon, go away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, Uptight. Night, you two. Sleep well,\u201d he added, then turned and shut the door behind him.</p><p>Ty sat on the edge of the bed again, his chest still tight. He\u2019d always been the role model in his generation of Grady kids, and ever since he\u2019d been old enough to understand what responsibility was, his greatest fear was that he\u2019d let one of them down. To see the sincerity in his brother\u2019s eyes when he\u2019d told him he was proud of him soothed Ty\u2019s soul in a way not many other things could.</p><p>\u201cYour brother\u2019s a latent stoner, isn\u2019t he?\u201d Zane asked fondly.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything latent about it.\u201d</p><p>Zane laughed and scooted down in the bed, pulling on Ty\u2019s arm as he went. \u201cCome here.\u201d</p><p>Ty lay down with him, curling around him and settling his head on Zane\u2019s shoulder. He\u2019d grown comfortable with the opportunities he had to do this, to lean on Zane both physically and emotionally. It had taken him a long time to come to terms with the fact that it didn\u2019t make him weak. When Zane wrapped his arms around him, it felt right.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m proud of you too, Beaumont.\u201d</p><p>The next morning was a little tense, to say the least, but better than Ty had expected under the circumstances. Breakfast started out stilted and awkward, but Deuce kept a conversation going with Zane about motorcycles, and Ty eventually got Mara to start rambling about the plans for the Bluefield Fourth of July parade. Then they all moved to the living room with coffee and homemade sweet rolls. It was the general consensus that, with Earl\u2019s impressive black eye and Ty\u2019s broken hand, they could skip church.</p><p>Deuce took the seat next to Zane on the couch, so Ty sat down on the floor between their feet as the conversation strengthened on the current baseball standings. Earl and Chester both were die-hard Braves fans just like Ty, but Deuce had jumped ship and started pulling for his hometown Phillies several years back. It made for a lively discussion when Deuce started gloating.</p> <p>Finally the idle talk came around to one of the many subjects Ty had been dreading.</p><p>\u201cI do have one question for you two,\u201d Earl said.</p><p>\u201cJust one?\u201d Ty asked, though his heart had started racing. He glanced furtively over his shoulder at Zane. His lover seemed relaxed, but Ty knew that Zane was a lit fuse beneath the surface. Zane shrugged.</p><p>\u201cWhen you were here last, Zane, you were wearing a wedding band,\u201d Earl said, frowning at him.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>Earl looked from Zane to Ty, raising an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cMy wife died in a car accident five years before I met Ty.\u201d</p><p>Earl nodded, watching Zane with what might have passed for sympathy.</p> <p>\u201cAnd you still wore your ring? Our condolences, Zane dear, that must have been hard on you,\u201d Mara offered.</p><p>Zane smiled. \u201cYes, ma\u2019am. It was.\u201d</p><p>Ty knew Zane would never admit how hard. Becky\u2019s death had been the catalyst that threw Zane into both alcohol and drugs, problems he would struggle with for the rest of his life.</p><p>That, coupled with the fact that Becky\u2019s memory was one of the most terrifying things Ty associated with Zane, made him shift uneasily on the floor. He would have liked to derail the conversation, but he couldn\u2019t figure out how. Zane was able to talk about Becky more easily than he used to, though it was still rare, and he was definitely more comfortable with it than Ty was. For Ty, it hit on the one major insecurity he still carried with him: you couldn\u2019t compete with a ghost any more than you could run away from one.</p><p>\u201cLosing hits a man hard,\u201d Chester said.</p><p>Ty closed his eyes and sighed. He was going to duct tape his grandfather\u2019s mouth closed before this visit was over. He opened his eyes when he felt a soft touch on his shoulder: Zane\u2019s fingers, resting there.</p><p>\u201cYes, it does,\u201d Zane agreed, squeezing Ty\u2019s shoulder once before pulling away. \u201cTy saved me.\u201d</p><p>Ty stared at him, his heart racing.</p><p>He finally had to force himself to look away. He met his father\u2019s eyes. Earl gave an apologetic tip of his chin.</p><p>Zane\u2019s knee rapped against Ty\u2019s shoulder. When Ty looked up at Zane, Zane\u2019s eyes were focused on him. He rested his cast on Zane\u2019s leg and leaned against the couch, trying to come to terms with the fact that they no longer had to hide from his family. It was freeing, but it also felt like another shoe was preparing to drop somewhere.</p><p>\u201cWell, I just have to say it, and I know it\u2019ll embarrass you,\u201d Mara announced, \u201cbut you two are adorable together.\u201d</p><p>Ty heard a choked laugh from behind him as he blinked at his mother. True to form, he felt himself blushing.</p><p>Earl was smiling as he leaned back on the loveseat.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a word I would never have chosen to describe Ty,\u201d Zane said, practically snickering.</p><p>\u201cWell, you didn\u2019t raise him. He was cute once. One day I\u2019ll show you the picture books.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMa, please,\u201d Ty begged, beginning to laugh as Deuce cackled from his spot on the other end of the couch. Ty glanced at him, narrowing his eyes. \u201cHow\u2019s Livi and the baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, nicely played.\u201d</p><p>Ty shrugged.</p><p>\u201cLivi is as happy as she can be when she\u2019s not puking her brains out. Her dad hates me, but her mom keeps sending us baby boutique catalogues.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you found out if it\u2019s a boy or girl yet?\u201d Mara asked.</p><p>Deuce shook his head.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLivi wants to know so we can decorate. She wants to continue the tradition of the names, though. She thinks it\u2019s the greatest thing ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Ty blurted, and Deuce laughed and nodded.</p><p>\u201cIs that just the boys?\u201d Zane asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah, the first boys in the family get their maternal grandmother\u2019s maiden names, the second get their paternal grandmother\u2019s. Then it gets convoluted,\u201d Deuce said with a smirk. \u201cDad\u2019s first name is Antrim. Grandpa\u2019s is actually Chester.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFascinating,\u201d Zane said.</p><p>\u201cSo, if you have a boy, what\u2019s his name going to be?\u201d Ty asked, trying to keep any opinion of the matter out of his voice.</p><p>\u201cRigsdale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God, Deacon,\u201d Ty groaned before he could stop himself.</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019m praying for a girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood luck with that,\u201d Zane said half under his breath, then flinched and pulled his phone from his pocket to look at the display.</p><p>Ty cleared his throat. \u201cWho wants some pie?\u201d he asked as he pushed himself up off the floor.</p><p>\u201cYeah, me,\u201d Zane answered as he stood and paced toward the front door, answering the call. \u201cHey. Everything okay?\u201d</p><p>Ty glanced back at him as he made his way toward the kitchen. He assumed it was Zane\u2019s sister; she was the only person Zane ever used that voice with. He slowed when Zane stopped mid-stride, hand out to open the door, shoulders snapping back. \u201cWhat? Where is he?\u201d Judging by his tone, something was very wrong. Zane listened silently, the frown on his face deepening. \u201cAnd no one was with him?\u201d</p><p>Ty watched him, pie and baby names and everything else forgotten.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be on a plane as soon as I can. I\u2019ll text you my flight information. Have Manuel pick me up at the airport.\u201d Zane slid the phone back into his pocket. When he turned back to see all the Gradys watching him, he froze.</p><p>When he didn\u2019t speak, Ty spread his hands out. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>Zane looked at him and swallowed. \u201cMy dad\u2019s been shot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my gracious,\u201d Mara exclaimed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going down there?\u201d</p><p>Zane nodded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTy.\u201d</p><p>Earl was already heading for the kitchen. \u201cI\u2019ll call Jim, see if he can get one of his boys to meet you with a Sheriff\u2019s car. Get you to the airport faster.\u201d</p><p>Zane stared at Ty, dumbstruck and distressed. He no longer even tried to hide behind that mask he\u2019d once used.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d Zane asked, sounding defeated. \u201cYou can\u2019t get off work without telling them why.\u201d</p><p>Ty gritted his teeth, but Zane was right. He would never be given time off work for his partner\u2019s family emergency, especially since he was already pretty far into his personal days.</p><p>Zane took a deep breath. Ty reached up to hug him, and Zane rested his forehead on Ty\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be okay.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 3</p><p>\u201cWhat interest does the FBI have in this case?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone,\u201d Zane answered. He was sitting in the double oven that served as the sheriff\u2019s outpost for the area ranches, fighting the urge to yank his tie off and use it to wipe away the sweat running down the center of his back. The old A/C unit in the window of the trailer wasn\u2019t doing anything to fend off the summer temperatures of Texas.</p><p>The sheriff cocked his head, and Zane leaned forward to speak in lower tones. \u201cHarrison Garrett is my father. I\u2019m not here in any official capacity; I\u2019m just trying to figure out what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re one of those Garretts?\u201d the sheriff asked, and Zane could see the man\u2019s defenses lowering.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>Zane produced his identification again. The sheriff gave it another once over, taking his time with it. He nodded and held up a thin file, then set it in front of Zane. \u201cThat\u2019s all I got to give you.\u201d</p><p>Zane paged through the file, distraught by the lack of information.</p><p>\u201cI can save you some time.\u201d</p><p>Zane glanced up at him and nodded.</p><p>\u201cThis is the fifth time your daddy\u2019s found evidence of trespassers on the ranch. Same place every time. We don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing, or why they\u2019re doing it. There\u2019s nothing out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think the encounter was violent this time and not ever before?\u201d Zane asked. He pushed the file into his laptop case.</p><p>\u201cWell, this was the first time he\u2019d caught them in action. Before, it was always after the fact. Harrison came across them, challenged them, and they fired at him. He was hit, but managed to get away. Tied himself to the saddle in case he passed out before his horse could make it back to the big house.\u201d</p><p>Zane couldn\u2019t help but smile as he listened to the account. His dad was a hard man. Zane wouldn\u2019t want to meet up with him on the open plains, that was for sure.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the scene itself?\u201d</p><p>The sheriff winced. \u201cNot much to it. Two days from everything. Ground\u2019s been baked harder than cement. Summer rain washed away what was left. I got some good trackers here, but there was nothing to find.\u201d</p><p>Zane nodded. He knew a pretty good tracker himself. Maybe he could convince his boss to allow Ty to come out here and help him.</p><p>He kind of doubted it.</p><p>\u201cAnd there\u2019s nothing local going on? Nothing your guys have caught wind of?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouple brawls between the ranch hands at the establishments. Couple boys with more money than they should have. Their names are in that file, but it\u2019s nothing a little backdoor gambling won\u2019t explain.\u201d</p><p>Zane thanked the sheriff, shaking his hand before retreating from the stifling trailer and into the open air. The sun was blazing down, making the blacktop appear to waver. But it felt cooler out here than it had in there. He hurried to the truck, one of the ranch\u2019s fleet, and fumbled to get the engine running before he burst into flames.</p><p>He sat in the cab, waiting for the air to kick in and ruminating over what he\u2019d just learned. There was no rhyme or reason to it. He\u2019d looked at a map of the area where his dad had encountered the trespassers, and it was near nothing but an old pump house. The underground river that had once fed the spring had long since changed its course, making the area just another barren corner of the massive ranch that served no purpose but as a riding trail for visitors.</p><p>Zane got the truck moving, heading back to the ranch and the guesthouse he had claimed as his while there. After a shower to wipe away the dust and massive, massive amounts of dried sweat, he settled at the kitchen table and pulled out his cell phone to check the time. Nine at night\u2014still early enough to phone Ty without waking him.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t been diligent with keeping in touch, and Ty had sent text messages to check on him rather than risk calling at an inopportune time.</p><p>Zane found that he couldn\u2019t wait to hear Ty\u2019s rumbling, easy voice in his ear. He\u2019d been in Texas three days, and he was starting to feel almost homesick. He couldn\u2019t recall feeling like that before, even as a child.</p><p>For the first time, he had a home he actually wanted to call home. The thought made him both ecstatic and melancholy.</p><p>He pulled up Ty\u2019s number and hit the button. When Ty answered, it sounded almost like a pair of plastic Solo cups cartwheeling down stairs. A moment of background noise later, Ty answered with a breathless, \u201cThis is Special Agent Grady, hang up and call 911 if this is an emergency.\u201d</p><p>Zane chuckled. Apparently, Ty hadn\u2019t even been able to look at the display to see Zane\u2019s name.</p><p>There were a few banging sounds and another tumble of plastic, then a muttered oath from Ty. Again, he spoke into the phone. \u201cOne second.\u201d</p><p>In the background was a piercing shriek, then a round of raucous laughter, and another woman\u2019s scream to top it all off. Ty, sounding far away, like he was holding the phone near his hip, shouted, \u201cJust let me shoot it!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A rustle, and then Ty was the one screaming. Zane remembered the last time he\u2019d heard that sound coming from Ty.</p><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t be a mouse in the house with Smith and Wesson on duty,\u201d he said, although he knew Ty wasn\u2019t listening.</p><p>He dismissed the idea that Ty was at home after being treated to several people screaming, cursing, and banging. Some voices were overcome with laughter, some screaming bloody murder.</p> <p>\u201cWho the hell brings a ferret into a bar?\u201d Ty shouted, and someone shouted back that all the shouting was scaring the ferret.</p><p>Zane frowned as he listened to the chaotic scene for another minute before most of the activity ceased.</p><p>When Ty returned to the phone, he was out of breath and sounding quite contrite. \u201cThis is Agent Grady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, doll,\u201d Zane said, lips curving into a smile just at hearing Ty\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cZane? Thank God. I knew I was going to get written up for that.\u201d</p> <p>Zane laughed. \u201cHaving a rough night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA ferret, huh? Well, I was close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot as close as I was. How\u2019s your dad?\u201d</p><p>Zane sighed. \u201cHe\u2019s all right. They\u2019ve got him in a regular room now. Talking about sending him home in a few days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good. How are you?\u201d</p> <p>Zane considered how to answer that, though the pause told more of the truth than any words he could speak. \u201cMore tired than I should be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I wish there was something I could do,\u201d Ty said in the whispered, intimate tone Zane had been so desperate to hear.</p><p>\u201cGot a few minutes to talk to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, give me one second.\u201d Ty said good-bye to whoever else had been involved in the business with the ferret, and a moment later Zane could hear traffic and a breeze brushing over the speaker of Ty\u2019s phone. He\u2019d obviously been at a bar, been assaulted by a ferret, and was now walking home. It was a typical night for Ty. \u201cI\u2019m all yours.\u201d</p><p>Zane hummed. \u201cThat\u2019s nice to hear.\u201d He rubbed one hand over his face. \u201cListen, the situation down here appears to be a little more . . . complex than I first thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re saying that Dad getting shot was a byproduct of trespassers, but I\u2019m not buying it. Something feels . . . weird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike, \u2018our job\u2019 weird, or \u2018you\u2019re in Texas\u2019 weird?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBoth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad says he was out riding on the far end of the property and came across trespassers near the old pump house. They took a few potshots and got lucky as they drove off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe thing is, there\u2019s nothing near that old pump house. No reason for anyone to be there. I can\u2019t figure it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, what, you\u2019re calling in Jim Bowie and Sam Houston to clear shit up?\u201d</p><p>Zane laughed despite the gravity of the situation. \u201cI\u2019m going to make some calls, yes, but I spoke with the sheriff this afternoon. He told me this isn\u2019t the first time it\u2019s happened. Dad\u2019s reported it before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKind of far from the border for the usual stuff, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but that doesn\u2019t mean it couldn\u2019t make it this far. Could be drugs, could be sex trade, could be horses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf the next option is sex with horses, I need you to stop right there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not in that part of Texas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet you look hot in the hat though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop trying to distract me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Ty said, though he didn\u2019t sound sincere.</p><p>\u201cAs I was saying . . . Jesus, Ty, what was I saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not sleeping, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to stay and look into it, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Zane said with a sigh of relief. He should have known Ty would understand. \u201cSo that means I might be here a little while longer than I\u2019d planned.\u201d</p><p>Ty didn\u2019t say anything to that, but the silence spoke volumes about his disappointment. Zane could imagine his broad shoulders slumping as he walked. He wanted to reach through the phone and hug his partner, who was, for all intents and purposes, a large teddy bear with a gun.</p><p>\u201cDo you need anything from my end?\u201d Ty finally asked.</p><p>Zane could think of plenty, first and foremost being Ty himself. He didn\u2019t say that, though, because he knew Ty couldn\u2019t take time off work for Zane\u2019s personal problems. \u201cNo, I think I\u2019ve got it covered. I thought I might call and get a sanity check in the evenings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall whenever you want. Mostly I\u2019ve been in the office, trying to inflict a paper cut on myself serious enough to require medical leave.\u201d</p><p>Zane grinned. \u201cMac would just tell you to suck it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHence the many failed attempts at tripping on the rug at the entryway. The one time I managed it, I tucked and rolled and popped back up before I could think twice about it.\u201d</p><p>Zane laughed\u2014the first real laugh he\u2019d managed in days. It was hard to tell if Ty was serious or just playing with him, and that was one of the things Zane loved so much about him. Ty really was the type of guy who would ninja roll through the lobby of a government building and just keep walking as if nothing had happened.</p><p>A door opened and closed, and Zane heard rustling as Ty took off his jacket and moved around the house. Ty whispered to Smith and Wesson. It was a tender side to his lover no one else had seen, and it all culminated in the way he treated those damn cats.</p><p>For a brief moment, Zane was almost sick with the need to wrap Ty up in a hug.</p><p>\u201cAre you really okay, Zane?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor now,\u201d Zane said, voice hoarse. He shifted to look out the window. There were no lights. Nothing on the skyline but the occasional hill or scrub tree. And stars as far as he could see, stretching on into the night. \u201cI wish you could see this, Ty.\u201d</p><p>Ty was silent. Zane was familiar with that silence; he heard it almost every time he said something sincere to his lover and Ty tried to decide if he should respond with a joke or with something more genuine. Zane never knew what kind of response he would get, and that was half the fun of it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ll see it one day,\u201d Ty said softly.</p><p>Zane closed his eyes. He almost wished Ty had made a joke of it this time. He missed him. There was no point in lingering over it, so he moved on.</p><p>\u201cThe real problems come when Mother shows up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s barely been to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid your folks split up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf they have, no one\u2019s told me. They\u2019re still both living in the same house, but it\u2019s so big they wouldn\u2019t cross paths if they didn\u2019t want to.\u201d Zane had always wondered how his dad lived with his mother every day, but to get through forty-five years of marriage, he obviously loved her on some level. \u201cWhen she shows up, all she can do is tell me that none of this would have happened if I\u2019d been here like a good son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know that\u2019s bullshit, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but . . . she\u2019s my mom.\u201d Zane dragged his hand through his damp hair. \u201cYou\u2019d think she\u2019d just be glad to see me, but no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Zane. I\u2019m not really sure how to help. Other than to tell you to quit your bitching and go buy me a Stetson.\u201d</p><p>Zane chuckled at Ty\u2019s attempt to distract him from his troubles. As usual, it was working. \u201cI don\u2019t know. A Stetson\u2019s a real personal thing to a man. You don\u2019t just go around handing them out.\u201d He shook his head and spoke more quietly. \u201cI\u2019m not sure there\u2019s helping to be done. Just wish you were here.\u201d</p><p>Ty was silent for a long while\u2014another of those silences where he tried to decide which path to take\u2014the sound of his breathing steady and comforting. Then he cleared his throat and said, \u201cWell, you want me to tell you about my night? Any story that starts out with \u2018There was this dude with a ferret in his beard\u2019 is bound to make you feel better, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d Zane said, smiling and relaxing back as Ty started talking. He was glad to listen to his lover ramble on in a voice as smooth as honey instead of dwelling over the trouble he was sure to find tomorrow when he started digging.</p><p>\u201cSuspect is on foot, agents in pursuit,\u201d the dispatcher said through Ty\u2019s earpiece. \u201cSuspect is armed and dangerous.\u201d</p><p>Ty cut across three lanes of traffic, climbing over a Mini Cooper and then leaping over the head of a cyclist as he dove to grab for the suspect. He made contact but slid right off the man and landed hard, rolling across the sidewalk and slamming into the base of a hotdog cart. The contents tumbled and splattered all over him before he could scramble back to his feet.</p><p>He cursed and wiped relish off his arm as he sat up. He supposed he was fortunate the boiling water hadn\u2019t fallen on him, but that stroke of luck didn\u2019t make up for the fact that this was ruining what had been a nice Sunday afternoon with friends.</p><p>He could sprint and he could cover long distances, and he could fucking parkour up the side of a wall, but he wasn\u2019t built for dashing across entire cities after suspects who were part gazelle and greased up like that slimy green thing from Ghostbusters.</p><p>\u201cI lost him,\u201d Alston panted over the earpiece. \u201cHe\u2019s like a cyborg or something.\u201d</p><p>Ty looked around as he tried to catch his breath. He and his teammates had been enjoying lunch at a sidewalk caf\u00e9 after closing a difficult week, debating if they should order a bottle of wine or just walk a few blocks over to the nearest bar and start Sunday off early like good little heathens. And then a man had paraded up to them in a trench coat and whipped it open to reveal nothing underneath but a huge, unfortunate tiger tattoo on his chest. His nipples formed the tiger\u2019s eyes, his navel acted as the nose, and Ty hadn\u2019t allowed himself to examine it any further before he\u2019d turned his head and spit his water all over Alston. Lassiter had jumped to his feet and knocked Perrimore\u2019s bowl of hot pasta into his lap. And Clancy had almost fallen out of her chair laughing. She\u2019d thought it funny until the man had grabbed her, kissed her, and then run off with her sidearm.</p><p>\u201cMaybe not having any clothes on makes him aerodynamic,\u201d Lassiter muttered, sounding just as out of breath as Alston was.</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t the trench slow him down?\u201d Perrimore wheezed. The man was built like a brick shithouse: good for barreling through locked doors, but not made for long-distance.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got his coat,\u201d Ty said with a laugh. He was barely winded, but then, he ran every day and had for years. The hotdog cart had fared better than he had, though.</p><p>\u201cEyes on the suspect!\u201d Clancy shouted, her piercing voice nearly busting Ty\u2019s eardrum. He reached up to his Bluetooth piece and turned the volume down.</p><p>\u201cClancy!\u201d Alston shouted. It was a safe bet that he\u2019d just been outdistanced by his spitfire of a partner and was now huffing and puffing to catch up to her.</p><p>Ty jogged to the end of the street, looking both ways.</p><p>\u201cWhere the fuck are you?\u201d Ty asked.</p><p>\u201cI got to get a treadmill,\u201d Perrimore said.</p><p>\u201cI think . . . I think I\u2019m outside Ty\u2019s house,\u201d Lassiter added.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not, Lassie,\u201d Ty assured him. \u201cYou can\u2019t run that far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll these fucking houses look alike!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou went the wrong way, you fucktard!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWest Lombard! Heading toward downtown,\u201d Clancy shouted.</p><p>\u201cWe might need backup with this fucker,\u201d Alston gasped. He was still on the move.</p><p>\u201cIf you say \u2018he\u2019s slippery,\u2019 I\u2019m going to knock you on your ass,\u201d Ty grumbled.</p><p>\u201cSomeone, for the love of God, get ahead of him!\u201d Alston was gasping for air. \u201cI\u2019m done. I\u2019m done. I\u2019m dying.\u201d</p><p>Ty fished his badge out of his pocket and stepped into the middle of Pratt Street, flagging down a taxi. When the man stopped, Ty went to the driver\u2019s side door and flipped his badge open. \u201cHow good are you with hairpin turns?\u201d</p><p>They sped along the busy streets that connected the Inner Harbor with the downtown financial district, narrowly missing parked cars, pedestrians, and further hotdog vendors. Ty caught a glimpse of Clancy, her red hair and even stride unmistakable as she sprinted along the sidewalk. Just ahead of her was the streaking man with the tiger tattoo, Clancy\u2019s gun clenched in his hand, a grin in place. He had no idea what sort of pain would rain down on him when she caught him.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t gaining on him, but she wasn\u2019t losing ground either. She would catch him, eventually. In heels.</p><p>Ty tried to raise her on the conference call they had initiated, tapping his Bluetooth headset, but his phone had either died or ended the call on its own.</p><p>\u201cGet ahead of Naked Guy,\u201d Ty told the driver as he gripped the door handle.</p><p>The taxi took a turn that almost put it up on two wheels, and it came to a screeching, jarring halt just as the streaker darted across the street. He dodged the taxi, leaping up onto the hood to try to slide across it. No doubt the guy had seen it in a movie somewhere, because no one in their right mind would try that otherwise. He hit the hood of the taxi, and the driver let out a horrified scream.</p><p>\u201cBall prints on my hood!\u201d the man cried as he gripped his steering wheel and shook it.</p><p>Bare skin squealed against the windshield. The man didn\u2019t even make it halfway across the car before his own nakedness stopped him dead, and he lay splayed against the hood and windshield like a squashed bug. A big, sweaty, squashed, naked bug. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ty got out of the car, joined by Clancy just in time to hold the man down for her as she disarmed and handcuffed him.</p><p>A crowd was gathering, laughing and pointing, applauding and booing.</p><p>Ty had to turn away from their prisoner so he wouldn\u2019t laugh when he called in the arrest. But his phone was full of mustard and pickle bits and wouldn\u2019t turn on. Alston joined them, holding his side and wincing as he pulled his phone out to make the call. Then he called Perrimore and asked him to bring one of the cars to them.</p> <p>\u201cWhat the hell happened to you?\u201d Alston asked Ty as he looked him up and down.</p><p>Ty looked at his shirtfront\u2014gray with a huge badge on it, and the words \u201cGravity \u2013 It\u2019s the Law\u201d printed across the top. It was now covered with splatters of ketchup, mustard, relish, and chili.</p><p>\u201cYou smell delicious,\u201d Alston said with a smirk.</p><p>\u201cBite me, Scott.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might, Hot Dog; I didn\u2019t finish my lunch back there.\u201d</p> <p>Ty couldn\u2019t help but snort.</p><p>\u201cHot Dog. That one might stick,\u201d Clancy said. When Ty looked at her, she snapped a picture of him with her phone.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor Garrett,\u201d Clancy said, eyes wide and sincere.</p><p>\u201cHey, pretty lady,\u201d the streaker said to Clancy. He was oblivious to his own ridiculousness.</p><p>Ty and Alston both turned to look at him, eyebrows climbing. Whatever this guy was on, it was good stuff. The tiger on his chest was one of the worst pieces of art Ty had ever seen, and it got worse as the man moved. He was jutting his hips out, shameless, knees rocking like he was hearing music. His hair was slicked back and he had a full-blown porn \u2019stache, complete with gel in it to make it curl upward.</p> <p>\u201cIs that a mirror in your pocket, baby?\u201d he said to Clancy with a goofy leer. \u201c\u2019Cause I can sure see myself in your pants.\u201d</p><p>Clancy rolled her eyes as she checked her weapon and stuffed it into her holster.</p><p>Ty looked the guy up and down. \u201cBuddy, you don\u2019t have the sack to wear her pants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn straight,\u201d Clancy said.</p><p>Ty held his hand up and she gave him a high-five as she strolled away. Alston was laughing as Ty pulled a twenty out of his wallet. He handed it to the taxi driver through the window. \u201cFor the car wash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLunch is on Grady!\u201d</p><p>Zane lay awake in bed, listening to the sounds of the house settling and staring at the darkened ceiling.</p><p>He looked at his phone, sitting on the bedside table, then picked it up to check the time. Nearly three in the morning; there was no way he could call Ty and not wake him. And wanting to hear his lover\u2019s voice was not a good enough reason to wake him.</p> <p>He scrolled through the photo roll, surprised at the homesickness that came over him as he looked at picture after picture of him and Ty. Most of them were taken from arm\u2019s length, with Ty in his aviators and Zane smiling like someone who hadn\u2019t been broken by life.</p><p>Some were of Ty alone, photos that Zane had taken without Ty\u2019s knowledge. Only one was of Ty without clothes. Maybe. And, of course, there was the photo Clancy had sent him this afternoon, with no explanation for why Ty was covered in condiments and looking like he\u2019d just run a marathon. Zane had to laugh, though. He couldn\u2019t wait to hear that story. They hadn\u2019t worked today, so whatever had happened was merely a result of Ty\u2019s unspeakable ability to attract weird things.</p><p>Zane stopped flipping through the photos when he came across his absolute favorite. He and Ty had taken a weekend trip to Virginia Beach to celebrate Ty\u2019s birthday on Memorial Day weekend. They\u2019d been standing on the beach in front of their hotel, watching a thunderstorm roll in from the sea. Everyone else had scrambled inside, and while Zane had tried to convince Ty to go in as well, Ty had chosen to stay and watch. The sky had been an impressive velvet blue, with rays of sunshine punching through as the blackness encroached. The look on Ty\u2019s face had been serene and somehow melancholy as he watched the storm whip up the tide and thrash against the shore in front of them.</p><p>Zane had snapped the picture with his phone without Ty knowing, leaving the phone near his hip and capturing Ty from below. Ty had never caught on that Zane was watching him instead of the storm, so wrapped up in whatever it was about storms out on the ocean that seemed to fascinate Ty like they did.</p><p>When the rain had hit the beach and Zane had turned to retreat to their room, Ty grabbed him instead and started a waltz in the downpour. When they finished the dance, people applauded from their balconies. It had been the first taste of what life with Ty might be like when they came out.</p><p>It had also been one of the most romantic moments of his life. He would never be able to top Ty\u2019s off-the-cuff romance with anything he planned ahead of time. He intended to spend the rest of his life trying, though.</p><p>His heart twisted as he looked at the photo, and a bittersweet feeling settled in his chest. It was still sinking in that he had a family in West Virginia now, a family that knew he and Ty loved each other and accepted that for what it was.</p><p>And now he was back in Texas with so much uncertainty swirling around him that it made him nauseous just to think of it. His mother\u2019s constant badgering, his father injured and on the warpath, the possibility that whatever was happening on the ranch was just starting instead of ending . . .</p><p>And on top of all of that, Zane couldn\u2019t help imagining what it would be like to be able to bring Ty here and introduce him to his family as the love of his life.</p><p>Before he knew what he was doing, he\u2019d clicked back over to his favorite numbers, hit Ty\u2019s picture, and pressed the call button.</p><p>It took a few rings, but Ty answered with a hoarse, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Zane smiled and closed his eyes again, breathing out a sigh of relief. He could just imagine Ty stretched out in their bed, sheets tangled around his muscular body. He\u2019d be warm and pliant, his fingers gentle against Zane\u2019s skin as he reached out to him. He\u2019d smell faintly of Old Spice, and his hair, which had grown, would be just long enough for Zane to twirl around his fingers and hold onto as they kissed.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Zane whispered, voice choked on the sudden rush of sentiment and arousal.</p><p>\u201cZane? Are you okay? What\u2019s wrong? Is it your dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. Nothing\u2019s wrong, I just miss you.\u201d</p><p>Ty was silent, and Zane could hear his harsh breaths as he sat up in bed. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing, I just . . . I\u2019m lying here in this huge bed and I can\u2019t sleep.\u201d</p><p>Ty sighed. \u201cI miss you too, Zane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I woke you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Today was a slow day, it\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>Zane narrowed his eyes. \u201cI know your definition of a slow day, and I got Clancy\u2019s picture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well . . .\u201d</p><p>Zane heard a harsh breath and a shuffle of sheets. He suspected Ty had just stretched back out in bed, and the mental image of his lover was enough to slide his hand beneath the band of his boxers. His palm rested on his hip, fingers grazing his hardening cock.</p><p>\u201cAre you as miserable and lonely as I am?\u201d Ty asked, sounding pitiful.</p><p>Zane swallowed hard and looked around the bedroom of the guesthouse. He\u2019d been living here for a full week now. The king-sized bed was far too big, the room too empty and impersonal. The television offered no company, the art and trinkets held no memories for him. Even the view out the window had grown unfamiliar.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said, almost choking on the word.</p><p>\u201cZane,\u201d Ty whispered, pulling Zane back. \u201cI know what you\u2019re doing.\u201d</p><p>Zane found himself smiling at Ty\u2019s raspy voice, taking himself in hand to start a slow stroke. \u201cWhat am I doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame thing I am.\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s breath caught on an exhale. \u201cTy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo on, Zane. Close your eyes.\u201d</p><p>Zane hit his phone\u2019s speaker button, laid it beside his head on the pillow, and closed his eyes like Ty had asked. His hand squeezed and pulled, his actions slow and sensual, mimicking the way Ty touched him when they were fooling around. His other hand dragged across his abdomen, fingers sliding over ridges of hard muscle.</p><p>With Ty\u2019s rasping voice in his ear, Zane could imagine it. His fingers dragging over Ty\u2019s body, finding the occasional ridge of a scar, digging into those incredible muscles as they tensed. He could imagine Ty\u2019s hand wrapped around his cock, thumb sliding over the head, palm massaging his balls. He could picture himself under Ty, his hand between them, stroking Ty\u2019s cock as Ty ground against him.</p><p>Zane gasped and rolled his hips, stroking faster as Ty\u2019s seductive voice whispered to him from the pillow beside his head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d give anything to see you do that,\u201d Ty said, voice hitching. \u201cCome for me, Zane. I need to hear it.\u201d</p><p>Zane knew from the timbre of Ty\u2019s voice that he was touching himself as he lay alone in their bed. It was enough to make Zane\u2019s entire body tingle. He could picture it because Ty had done it for him several times, brought himself off as Zane watched.</p><p>He shoved the comforter and the sheets down past his hips and his boxers followed. The cold air of the room hit his skin, but he didn\u2019t care as he kicked free of everything restraining his movements.</p><p>\u201cBaby,\u201d he ground out, pleading with Ty to keep speaking. Ty did, murmuring to him, telling him how to touch himself, what he would do to him if he were there with him, how much he loved to hear the sounds Zane made. Zane didn\u2019t try to curtail his moans and groans, letting Ty hear them, letting Ty use them to reach his own end.</p><p>\u201cYou sound so good,\u201d Ty whispered, voice deep and harsh.</p><p>The rasp of his voice covered Zane, wrapping him in warmth and pleasure. Zane pushed his hips off the mattress, his entire body going into spasms.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Zane!\u201d Ty yelled, sounding just as desperate as he often did when Zane was inside him.</p><p>Zane shouted and reached up to dig his fingers into the headboard as he came. His hand moved faster, then his fingers massaged his balls for an even stronger orgasm as he came all over his belly and even up onto his chest. He could hear Ty talking him through it, but he didn\u2019t register the words until his breathing had calmed.</p><p>\u201cZane,\u201d Ty said, his voice sounding far away.</p><p>Zane reached for the phone and turned off the speaker, then held it to his ear. The cold air hit him as he calmed, and he knew he\u2019d have to get out of bed to at least wipe down with a damp towel before he could sleep. The stress was gone, though, and he told himself there was no reason to be lonely. Ty was out there, waiting for him, missing him.</p><p>\u201cAs good as that was, I prefer it in person,\u201d Zane said.</p><p>Ty chuckled, the sound dark and familiar. \u201cNow go clean yourself off. Look at you, you should be ashamed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDitto, you pervert,\u201d Zane grunted, smiling.</p><p>\u201cGoodnight, Zane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNight, Ty.\u201d</p><p>The call ended without any further fuss or pleasantries. Zane lay awake for a while longer, shocked by how a simple call and a few minutes listening to Ty\u2019s voice could turn his outlook around.</p><p>He fell asleep with the phone still in his hand.</p><p>\u201cDad, what were you thinking, going out there alone?\u201d Zane asked.</p><p>He pushed away from the railing of the big house\u2019s second-floor balcony and frowned at his father, who was sitting in one of the lounge chairs and staring out over the land.</p><p>He was shocked by the difference in the man. His hair had gone from steel gray to almost white in the last year or so. His face was thinner, bordering on gaunt, and though Zane was attributing much of it to his injuries, he was concerned by the lack of life in his father\u2019s dark eyes. The only things that hadn\u2019t changed were the impressive horseshoe mustache and the deep resonance of his voice.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking about getting shot, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re after.\u201d</p><p>Zane snorted and turned to look out over the land. \u201cYou should get some more help, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m doing just fine.\u201d</p><p>Zane snorted. \u201cYou\u2019re either stubborn or cheap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m lazy, there\u2019s a difference. Takes work to hire a new man I can trust.\u201d</p><p>Zane laughed, then pulled his phone out of his back pocket and checked it for the fifth time since they\u2019d gotten home. No texts or calls.</p><p>\u201cStill. Edges of the ranch are getting away from you.\u201d</p><p>Harrison frowned and looked out at the view of the sprawling Hill Country: acres and acres of unrelenting, rolling green, covered with prickly pear cactus and scrub trees that made passage on foot nearly impossible. It was a beautiful, foreboding landscape, and every inch they could see from their vantage point belonged to the Carter Garrett ranch. It was over five-thousand acres, and Harrison only employed two dozen or so ranch hands.</p><p>Zane leaned forward, watching his father. \u201cDad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWeren\u2019t you calling someone?\u201d Harrison said with a wave of his hand.</p><p>Zane grunted in annoyance, but nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back, just need to check in at work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake your time.\u201d</p><p>Zane paced away, heading toward the other end of the balcony as he dialed Ty. He\u2019d tried on the way to the hospital this morning, but hadn\u2019t been able to reach his partner. He\u2019d tried several times since bringing his father home, and each call had been kicked directly to voicemail. The phone didn\u2019t ring this time, either, just sent him to Ty\u2019s voicemail yet again. Zane hung up without leaving a message. A heavy, ominous feeling began to settle in his chest. There was no good reason Ty wouldn\u2019t answer his phone at this time of day.</p><p>He glanced back at his father, then dialed his work line.</p><p>\u201cThis is Special Agent Tyler Grady\u2019s desk,\u201d a woman answered. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cClancy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGarrett! Hey! How\u2019s your dad doing, is he okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh . . . yeah, he\u2019s okay. Just got home from the hospital, thanks for asking. I\u2019m looking for Ty, is he around?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, Hot Dog called in this morning and said he\u2019d been tasked out to DC again.\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s stomach began to churn as that news sank in. \u201cTasked out to DC\u201d was Ty\u2019s way of covering when Richard Burns needed a job done. Burns had promised Ty months ago that he wouldn\u2019t call him again for one of those jobs. Apparently, his promises had a shelf life of three months.</p><p>\u201cGarrett? You there?\u201d Clancy asked, sounding worried.</p><p>\u201cYeah, sorry. I . . . will you have him give me a call when he shows back up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, but you\u2019ll probably be home before he will. He said he\u2019d be gone for up to a week on this one.\u201d</p> <p>Zane nodded jerkily. \u201cOkay. Thanks, Clancy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem. Hey, you need anything from our end, you just ask, okay? We sent flowers to the hospital. Did your dad get them?\u201d</p><p>Zane barely heard what she was saying. \u201cYeah, he did. I meant to thank you.\u201d In truth, he had no idea if his father had gotten those flowers. That was the furthest thing from his mind now. \u201cI have to run, but I\u2019ll be in touch, okay? Thanks.\u201d</p><p>He hung up as he headed back toward his dad. When he sank into the chair beside him, the phone was still in his hand and he was staring out at the land, unseeing.</p><p>\u201cEverything okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou look like you got bad news,\u201d Harrison observed, his sharp eyes looking Zane up and down.</p><p>Zane smiled and told himself to pull it back together. \u201cYeah, just . . . my partner got loaned out to another agency. I can\u2019t get in touch with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that good or bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s dangerous, sometimes. Bad, I guess.\u201d</p><p>Harrison nodded. \u201cYou worried about your partner, Z?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, a little,\u201d Zane admitted.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good. Last time you were here, you weren\u2019t even worried about yourself.\u201d</p><p>The echoed chime of the front door saved Zane from having to respond. That was one conversation he did not want to have.</p> <p>\u201cSounds like someone left the gate open,\u201d Harrison said.</p><p>Every ranch in the Hill Country, big or small, had a gate. Sometimes that was all there was\u2014just a gate on the driveway with no fence to back it up. But the Carter Garrett Ranch had fences galore.</p><p>\u201cYou better get it. Juanita\u2019s at the store.\u201d</p><p>Zane nodded and went inside. The door chimed again as he jogged down the stairs. The house around him brought back all kinds of memories, some good, some not. Parts of the house had been comfortable and homey, mostly the parts frequented by his father or Zane and the other kids, while others had been museum pieces meant for magazine shoots and society functions. He got to the door and nudged the dog out of the way so he could open it.</p><p>What he saw left him speechless.</p><p>Ty grinned. \u201cWhat, it\u2019s the butler\u2019s day off?\u201d</p><p>Zane just stared, taking in the face that had filled his dreams for nearly a week. \u201cHow are you here?\u201d</p><p>Ty\u2019s smile softened into something more intimate, and he shrugged. \u201cYou sounded like you needed me.\u201d</p><p>It sunk in with another heartbeat, and Zane stepped forward to wrap his arms around Ty and held him tight. \u201cYes,\u201d he whispered. \u201cYes.\u201d He squeezed his eyes shut, hardly able to believe it. Ty was here. In Texas.</p><p>Ty hugged him hard, laughing.</p><p>It was a long minute before Zane could make himself step back, though he didn\u2019t pull loose of Ty\u2019s arms. Ty\u2019s tanned face and a day\u2019s worth of stubble was possibly the most beautiful thing Zane had ever laid eyes on. \u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, see, first I took a plane. And then I rented a car. And then after getting lost twice, I found a sign that said \u2018Garrett,\u2019 scaled the big-ass gate down by the road, and hitched a ride on a prairie dog here.\u201d He gave a mock frown. \u201cThose things are not as cute and cuddly as you\u2019d think.\u201d</p><p>Zane snorted and pulled Ty inside. \u201cFunny guy. Hell, I don\u2019t care how.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI caught the first flight out this morning,\u201d Ty said as he stepped into the marble-tiled foyer. \u201cCalled in a favor. All my favors, actually. I explained what was going on to Dick, and he\u2019s claiming me for as long as we need to be here so I don\u2019t have to use any comp time. And Alston took the case I was working in exchange for a personal favor of unknown origin later on.\u201d</p><p>Zane hugged him again, stunned by the lengths to which Ty had gone to be with him. Ty laughed, his long fingers sliding down Zane\u2019s back. Zane had to force himself to let go. He pushed the door shut behind them and looked down at the red and white Australian Shepherd sniffing at Ty\u2019s ankles.</p><p>Ty watched it warily. \u201cWhy do they like me?\u201d he whispered in exasperation. \u201cIt\u2019s like they smell that I was almost food once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullet likes everybody, even me.\u201d Zane leaned over to scratch the dog\u2019s ears and then shoo him away. The dog headed for the stairs, seeking out Harrison. When Zane straightened, it struck him all over again. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re here. And I can\u2019t believe how much I missed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI missed you too. Not enough to trek my ass to Texas, but you sounded . . . I just figured I needed to be here.\u201d</p><p>Zane hugged him again. He couldn\u2019t help himself. \u201cIt\u2019s just a shitty situation,\u201d he said, glancing toward the kitchen as he released Ty. His mother was around here somewhere. Maybe upstairs in her suite, or in her office. He was surprised she hadn\u2019t come out when the doorbell rang. \u201cBut I am so glad you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>Ty ran his hand down Zane\u2019s arm. Then he shook himself and shrugged his bag off his shoulder, handing it to Zane. \u201cI\u2019ll just make myself at home then.\u201d</p><p>Zane took it and dropped it on the floor next to the door. At Ty\u2019s raised eyebrow, he said, \u201cWe won\u2019t be staying here. We\u2014\u201d</p><p>His mother\u2019s voice rang out from upstairs. \u201cZane? Who was at the door?\u201d</p><p>Zane glanced to Ty and made a rude gesture toward the stairs. \u201cA friend of mine\u2019s here,\u201d he called back, and within a few moments, Beverly Carter-Garrett appeared at the banister halfway around the second floor.</p><p>\u201cA friend?\u201d she asked, looking down at them from on high. She paused for effect, and then made her way down the polished wooden staircase, a polite smile in place.</p><p>She cut a severe figure on the spiral staircase, her graying hair dyed a harsh black, her smile not touching her blue eyes. She hadn\u2019t been expecting company today, but that hadn\u2019t stopped her from donning a designer pantsuit, high heels, and a string of pearls; her entire life was about outward appearances, and always had been.</p><p>\u201cMa\u2019am,\u201d Ty said with a nod as she came down the stairs.</p><p>Beverly tipped her head to one side as she looked Ty over. He was wearing jeans and a plain white T-shirt, probably to ward off the blazing heat, and every inch of him was dusty. No way would he pass Beverly\u2019s inspection. He wasn\u2019t wearing a tie, after all. She turned her gaze to Zane as she stopped two stairs from the bottom\u2014a tactic with which he was familiar. It put her at about his eye level. He\u2019d gotten his height from his father and grandfather, so she\u2019d come up with a way to compensate.</p><p>\u201cMother, this is Special Agent Ty Grady. Ty, my mother, Beverly Carter-Garrett.\u201d</p><p>Beverly held out her hand, like royalty. Ty took a single step forward and took the tips of her fingers in his, bowing his head in a formal greeting that, for some reason, Zane was shocked to see his partner knew how to do. By the look on his mother\u2019s face, she was both surprised and pleased.</p><p>\u201cHello, Mr. Grady,\u201d Beverly said, voice still polite. \u201cHow do you know Zane?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m his partner, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>The warmth and charm that seemed to exude from Ty at all times were missing. He was being gracious, but almost cool to her. It was obvious to Zane that what he\u2019d said about his mother in the past was coloring Ty\u2019s behavior toward her, whether Ty meant for it to or not. But Beverly treated everyone like that. Zane figured she wouldn\u2019t think anything of it.</p><p>\u201cHis partner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Mother. And it\u2019s Special Agent Grady, not Mr. Grady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I see. I wasn\u2019t aware you had a partner, Zane.\u201d</p><p>Zane just smiled, not willing to give her a chance to start an old argument. She was baiting him, pure and simple. When she didn\u2019t get the response she wanted, she turned to Ty.</p><p>\u201cPlease, come in.\u201d Beverly indicated the sitting room to her left. \u201cTell me what brings you to Texas, Mr. Grady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Ty said, glancing back at Zane with a furrow of his brow. He was obviously wondering how much he should say, and probably how nice he had to be. Zane waved permissively\u2014go for it. \u201cZane told me his father was shot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that brought you all the way from Washington?\u201d she asked, sitting primly in the armchair that faced the couch. \u201cJust to see your coworker?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother, you know full well it\u2019s Baltimore, and Ty\u2019s not just my coworker, he\u2019s a close friend.\u201d</p><p>Beverly folded her hands in her lap. \u201cI thought perhaps he\u2019d brought some work for you. You do claim to be important to that place.\u201d</p><p>Ty looked between them. He cleared his throat, meeting Zane\u2019s eyes, and he pointed to the bag by the door. He held his hand against his chest, where only Zane could see it, and mimicked holding a gun. \u201cI did bring work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d Beverly said, her voice still cool. \u201cI was under the impression that Zane was to be at home with his family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMa\u2019am, I was under the impression that he\u2019s been at the hospital with his family. Weren\u2019t you there?\u201d</p><p>The change that came over Beverly\u2019s face was like a storm cloud passing over a clear blue sky. For once, she\u2019d been struck speechless. No one in the area had the nerve to say such things to her, and no one in the family bothered anymore. Zane knew she\u2019d dig in the spurs any chance she got, but he hadn\u2019t expected Ty to shoot back. The pointed words from his partner, and the quiet way Ty was standing up for him, warmed him in a way he knew he should have been ashamed of.</p><p>But he needed to curtail it before it went further. He knew what Ty\u2019s sharp tongue was capable of, and he knew his mother. Rather than waiting for the next verbal stab, he turned Ty toward the stairs.</p><p>\u201cMother, I\u2019m going to take Ty to meet Dad. We\u2019ll talk to you at dinner. Come on,\u201d he said to Ty.</p><p>Ty turned with him, pausing to nod at Beverly. \u201cNice to meet you, ma\u2019am,\u201d he offered as he followed Zane to the stairs.</p><p>\u201cDinner is at eight o\u2019clock sharp,\u201d Beverly called after them.</p><p>Zane didn\u2019t slow until they reached the second story landing and the small sitting alcove that led toward a set of double doors to the outside. He stopped short of opening them and turned to Ty. \u201cThat was the first time in years I\u2019ve seen someone do that to her.\u201d</p><p>Ty ran his hand down Zane\u2019s arm\u2014a gesture he reserved for when he felt Zane needed comforting. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. It kind of slipped out. I promise I\u2019ll be good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was spectacular,\u201d Zane whispered, smiling and pulling Ty closer, palming Ty\u2019s lower back as he reveled in the kiss. He couldn\u2019t express in words how much Ty being here meant. \u201cBut yeah. Try to be good so she doesn\u2019t banish you, huh? Dad\u2019s a lot easier. And drugged to the gills on pain meds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>Zane smiled as the rest of his mother-related tension melted away, and he led the way out to the porch. Harrison was sitting right where Zane had left him.</p><p>\u201cHey, Dad, I want you to meet someone.\u201d</p><p>Harrison turned his head and watched them approach. \u201cYou\u2019ll forgive me if I don\u2019t get up,\u201d he said, his gravelly voice even lower than usual. \u201cThis a friend of yours, Z?\u201d</p><p>Ty waved his broken hand out by his hip and stepped closer. He held his left out to Harrison. \u201cTy Grady, sir. It\u2019s a pleasure to meet you.\u201d The difference in his tone with Harrison was night and day to his tone with Beverly.</p><p>Harrison shook Ty\u2019s hand. He glanced up at Zane and back to Ty. \u201cZ\u2019s partner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>Harrison smiled. \u201cWondered if you\u2019d show.\u201d</p><p>Zane blinked. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou talk about your partner, Z. You\u2019re closer than you let on.\u201d</p><p>Zane glanced at Ty, surprised to feel himself blushing.</p><p>Harrison looked at Ty. \u201cYou\u2019re playing hooky from work to be here, aren\u2019t you, son?\u201d</p><p>Ty smiled. \u201cYes, sir, I suppose I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cZane\u2019s always there when I need him.\u201d He met Zane\u2019s eyes and added, \u201cWhat sort of partner would I be if I weren\u2019t here now?\u201d</p><p>Zane grinned.</p><p>\u201cHave a seat,\u201d Harrison said, waving at two chairs in the informal grouping.</p><p>They settled in, and Zane began to relax. Ty had apparently passed his dad\u2019s inspection, and his dad seemed content to let the conversation go at that. He never had been one for idle talk.</p><p>Zane looked to Ty. \u201cDid you eat on the way here? We\u2019ve got a few hours \u2019til dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had three peanuts on the airplane; I\u2019m good,\u201d Ty said, deadpan. \u201cIt really is like surface-of-the-sun hot here, huh?\u201d</p><p>Harrison snorted a laugh. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you two go on and get him settled in. No need to stay here until dinner.\u201d Zane opened his mouth to protest, but Harrison talked right on. \u201cI\u2019m well enough, Z. You\u2019ve been on your feet for days now. Take him and show him the ranch. Get some peace and quiet before dinner comes around and your mother starts in on you again.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ty looked to Zane, prepared to take his cues from Zane until he got a feel for the lay of the land. Classic Grady, studying his prey in its natural habitat before striking.</p><p>\u201cYou know what? I\u2019m going to do that and leave you to face Mom\u2019s wrath,\u201d Zane said, standing up. \u201cTy put her in her place just now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you, now? Would\u2019ve liked to\u2019ve seen that.\u201d</p> <p>Zane laid his hand on Ty\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll get another chance.\u201d</p><p>Harrison chuckled. \u201cGo on. I\u2019ll see you at dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, Dad,\u201d Zane said as he patted Harrison\u2019s good shoulder.</p><p>Ty stood and leaned over to shake Harrison\u2019s hand again. \u201cIt\u2019s a relief to see you doing well, sir.\u201d</p><p>Harrison cracked half a smile, which told Zane that he liked Ty quite a lot. \u201cWelcome to the C and G,\u201d he said instead of good-bye.</p> <p>They were driving away from the large colonial-style mansion, and Ty had just remembered to turn his phone back on when Zane spoke again.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re here,\u201d Zane said, shaking his head as he guided the truck down the long dirt driveway.</p><p>\u201cI was going to call and tell you I\u2019d be coming, but I know you. You\u2019d have tried to come get me at the airport and stressed about it. And I was kind of looking forward to surprising you.\u201d</p><p>Zane hit the brakes, veering off the private road onto a flat, sandy piece of land that looked just like all the other flat, sandy pieces of land surrounding them.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Ty asked, worried that he might have upset Zane by coming unannounced.</p><p>Zane jerked his seatbelt off and threw the truck into park. He left it running, though, the air conditioning blasting to ward off the blazing heat outside. Ty watched him in alarm, but then Zane leaned sideways and crawled across the bench seat to grab him and kiss him messily.</p> <p>Ty flailed, a hand going out to drag down the window as he tried to keep his balance, but Zane pulled him sideways and twisted him, toppling both of them over and into the passenger side door. He grunted as his head banged against the window, but he wrapped his arms around Zane, heedless of the knock on the head or the whatever-it-was sticking into his back or the seatbelt that might strangle him if Zane pulled him again.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re incredible, you know that? I\u2019m so goddamned lucky to have you,\u201d Zane said before stealing another kiss. Ty could only grunt in response.</p><p>He had to shove at Zane\u2019s chest when the kiss got too heated, holding him at bay with both hands, trapped against the door panel and looking up into those dark eyes he\u2019d missed so much. \u201cI refuse to let you grope me in the cab of a truck in your parents\u2019 driveway,\u201d he said, laughing as Zane began to chuckle.</p><p>Zane sat back, nodding and straightening his shirt. Ty shifted and pulled at his jeans. They\u2019d gotten far too tight.</p><p>\u201cSo, if we\u2019re not staying in the big house, where are we staying?\u201d he asked as Zane pulled the truck back onto the road.</p><p>\u201cGuesthouse. It\u2019s so much smoother if I\u2019m not under the same roof as my mother.\u201d He glanced at Ty and leered. \u201cAnd no one to hear you scream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m down with that,\u201d Ty drawled, smirking as he watched Zane. He was wearing dark jeans and cowboy boots, paired with a soft blue denim shirt that hugged his slim hips and highlighted his impressive shoulders and arms. The black Stetson on the dashboard had clearly been worn. His wavy black hair had a hat impression in it.</p><p>He looked incredible. Ty could feel his heart beating faster as he looked his lover over.</p> <p>\u201cSay something else,\u201d Ty prompted.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay something, tell me something else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, that\u2019s not weird at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease?\u201d</p><p>Zane gave him a tolerant sigh. \u201cThe closest town to us is Dripping Springs, and it\u2019s about a twenty-minute drive. The ranches out this way are all pretty massive and self-sufficient. The Carter Garrett Ranch is five thousand acres, the largest in the area. We raise horses mostly, but there\u2019s also cattle, sheep, and some llamas and emus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour accent has come out,\u201d Ty said when Zane paused.</p><p>Zane glanced at him, eyebrows raised. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s . . . incredibly sexy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay something else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, stop it,\u201d Zane said with a laugh.</p><p>Ty grinned, unable to take his eyes off Zane. \u201cWe need to go down to the front gate. I really did leave my rental there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were kidding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. Climbed the big-ass fence. Impressive, by the way. It\u2019s like a castle gate and somebody forgot to build the rest of the castle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, around here people don\u2019t see your house or your yard or your front door. You have to impress them with your gate. And Mother is all for impressing people.\u201d</p><p>Ty nodded. The gate to the Carter Garrett Ranch was quite beautiful: Two towers of stacked stone on either side of the drive, with a twisted metal art piece weaving between them. A sign hung from the metal, a stylized C and G intertwined with an ampersand. A simple iron gate between the towers kept visitors out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call and have one of the guys go fetch it,\u201d Zane promised.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you keep the gate closed? Is it to keep livestock in or people out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe ranch is open three days a week to the public. We have school trips and tour buses and people can book times for riding the trails or getting riding lessons. Supplemental income for the ranch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? People just drive up at any given time?\u201d</p><p>Zane shrugged. \u201cThursday through Saturday, yeah. So the other days they keep the gate closed, just in case people get the wrong day or get nosy.\u201d</p><p>Ty cleared his throat, barely able to concentrate on what Zane was saying for listening to how he was saying it. Jesus, where had that accent been all these months? He wondered if Zane suppressed it or if it was just something he\u2019d lost along the way and then had fallen back into when he\u2019d submerged himself back home.</p><p>He waved his broken hand toward the side of the road. \u201cCan you pull over for a minute?\u201d</p><p>Zane shot him a concerned glance and pulled the truck to the side of the gravel driveway, putting it in park.</p><p>Ty unbuckled his seatbelt and crawled toward him. The only thing preventing him from climbing right into Zane\u2019s lap was the steering wheel. Zane grabbed at him, laughing as they kissed again, over and over. Ty unbuckled Zane\u2019s seatbelt, pulling at him and leaning backward, and Zane wriggled out of the seatbelt and followed, laying Ty down on the bench seat. Ty propped his foot on the door and held on as Zane dug his hands into Ty\u2019s hair.</p><p>\u201cChrist, why\u2019d you have to start this?\u201d Zane grumbled. Ty could feel his body responding, and his jeans were going to be impossible to unzip in a few minutes if this kept up. \u201cWe\u2019re five fucking seconds from the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI missed you.\u201d Zane felt solid against his fingers, and after a week of closing his eyes and imagining it was Zane\u2019s touch in place of his own, Zane\u2019s weight felt incredible against him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to fuck you here,\u201d Zane said through gritted teeth, though he appeared to be trying to convince himself and not Ty.</p><p>Ty shook his head and hummed, but he pushed his hips up against Zane\u2019s and closed his eyes as sensation swept through him. \u201cDoes anyone else stay at this guesthouse?\u201d he asked, voice going lower.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Zane growled. He bent to kiss Ty\u2019s chin, and then kissed and nipped along his jawline until he reached Ty\u2019s neck and began to suck. \u201cWe\u2019ll have the whole place to ourselves.\u201d</p><p>Ty groaned, squirming under him. \u201cAre there washing machines at this guesthouse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, why?\u201d Zane whispered against Ty\u2019s ear.</p><p>Ty answered by delving into a messy, hungry kiss. He thrust up against Zane, rubbing their cocks together through the thick denim of their jeans.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Ty,\u201d Zane ground out. He shoved his hand under Ty, dragging his fingers against Ty\u2019s shoulder blades as he pushed their hips together. Ty gasped, thrust back, desire flowing between them in a feedback loop of desperate need.</p><p>Zane lapped at his lips, forcing his way in to lick and suck at Ty\u2019s as the kisses got messier and harder. They didn\u2019t even bother trying to unbutton their jeans, just rutted against each other. Ty rolled his hips to increase the friction. They were like teenagers necking, stealing a moment that couldn\u2019t be put off one second longer.</p><p>Zane shouted his name, clamping down on him so hard that Ty bowed his back to keep from being hurt. When he realized Zane was coming against him, he let go of the last vestiges of his pride and self-control as well, clutching at Zane and gritting his teeth against a moan as he came in his jeans.</p><p>It was a good mile before they hit a curve around a copse of trees that brought a group of buildings into view. Ty had seen the turn-off when he\u2019d walked up the driveway, but he hadn\u2019t paid it much attention at the time.</p><p>Zane stopped in front of the house, though he didn\u2019t cut the engine. \u201cThis is the guesthouse.\u201d</p><p>Ty nodded and looked around. There was a garage made to look like a barn, and a storage shed built like a carriage house. The house itself was a cabin, the bucolic fa\u00e7ade broken only by solar panels on the roof and a satellite bolted to the side. Ty glanced over at Zane, unsure of what to say now. He\u2019d known Zane and his family had money, but he hadn\u2019t realized until setting foot on the ranch that they were downright loaded. It took serious coin to keep a ranch like this running.</p><p>Zane glanced over at him but didn\u2019t press for a comment. \u201cI hope you\u2019ll consider it home for a while.\u201d</p><p>Ty enjoyed it when Zane got a little on the sentimental side. He was so sweet and vulnerable, it was hard not to love him. \u201cI\u2019ll do that.\u201d</p><p>Zane nodded, smiling.</p><p>Ty pointed at him sternly. \u201cAs long as I get a hat. And boots. Red ones. And I want a belt buckle bigger than my hand,\u201d he added as he held up his broken hand.</p><p>Zane was laughing as Ty rattled on. \u201cI can handle the hat and the boots,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I draw the line at the belt buckle.\u201d He grabbed the keys and unfastened his seatbelt.</p><p>\u201cBut why?\u201d</p><p>Zane reached over and dug his fingers into the front of Ty\u2019s jeans, which were still a mess from their foray into illicit groping. \u201cI\u2019m not breaking my hand when I want to get into your pants.\u201d</p><p>Ty snorted. \u201cFair enough. But don\u2019t be grabby, it\u2019s rude.\u201d He smacked at Zane\u2019s hand. \u201cAnd wash your hands.\u201d Grinning, Zane let him loose, then opened his door and climbed out of the truck.</p><p>Ty hopped out and reached into the bed of the truck to retrieve his bags, looking around at the house and trying to ignore how uncomfortable his jeans were. He liked the place. It was small and almost quaint, with hints of modern luxuries hidden behind the rustic details. He followed Zane through the little gate and up to the door. Zane didn\u2019t get out his keys; the door was unlocked.</p><p>Most of the inside was open up to the two-story pitched roof, with only a bedroom loft to break the space, and the back of the house was all glass, looking out to rolling hills and pasture. A huge stone fireplace dominated one wall, and a couple of comfortable-looking leather couches faced it. The furniture was minimal but functional.</p><p>Zane walked through the main room to open a sliding door that led out to a wraparound deck. A cross-breeze started up that was almost cool. Then he turned and looked at Ty. \u201cHow about we just lose the truck keys and stay awhile?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill we have to barricade the door?\u201d</p><p>Zane sniffed. \u201cNah. Although, as soon as Annie learns you\u2019re here, she\u2019ll barge in like a Tasmanian devil and demand to meet you.\u201d</p><p>Ty barked a laugh. Zane crossed the room back to Ty, pulling off his denim shirt and tossing it on a chair nearby.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d you do with the cats?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked Alston to feed them every night on his way home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlston?\u201d Zane said, his voice going alarmingly high. \u201cWhat if he goes upstairs? What if he sees all my shit in the closet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Zane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s scared of Smith and Wesson. And I told them not to let him past the first step.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTy,\u201d Zane said in exasperation.</p><p>Ty knew it made Zane nervous, but that was half the fun of it. He just raised an eyebrow and smiled.</p><p>Zane sighed and returned the smile, looking almost unwilling. \u201cThank you for coming.\u201d He stepped forward and pulled Ty into a kiss.</p><p>Ty returned it with something like relief. After so long apart, it was wonderful to get that kiss without the added urgency of needing to get off. Zane stepped back just long enough to unbutton his jeans and then Ty\u2019s, pushing them down so they could both kick out of them. Ty\u2019s boxer briefs went next, falling alongside Zane\u2019s. Then Zane slid his arms around Ty\u2019s waist so he could hold him close, drawing the kiss out. Ty hummed as he dragged both hands up Zane\u2019s arms and started to tug on his undershirt, but just as things were really starting to get interesting, the phone in the pocket of his jeans began to vibrate, followed by a loud sound that could only be described as an old car horn.</p><p>Ty grunted in annoyance as Zane stepped back.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell was that?\u201d</p><p>Ty snorted. \u201cI had to get a new phone. Got one like yours.\u201d</p><p>The phone honked at them again, and Ty bent to find it.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to your other one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelish. Long story.\u201d Ty rummaged through the pockets of his jeans. He held up his cast. \u201cHad to get a new cast, too. Everything got . . . I was covered in condiments.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d have to spill that story soon, because Zane rarely let things like that go for long, but he didn\u2019t offer to tell it right now. He sighed as he finally found his phone and looked at the display. It was a text message, one of the dozens he received every day. He shook his head and stood.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s from Nick,\u201d he said, knowing his old friend was a sore spot for Zane, and with good reason. But he was always honest with Zane whenever he spoke to Nick, even if it grated on the man. Hiding it would be a mistake, and Ty\u2019s conscience wouldn\u2019t condone it.</p> <p>Zane wrinkled his nose but didn\u2019t seem annoyed, which was a vast improvement from the way he\u2019d initially felt about Nick. \u201cWhat\u2019s he say?\u201d</p><p>Ty shrugged and looked down at the phone again. \u201cHe\u2019s working a weird case. I asked him to text me every now and then to let me know he\u2019s alive.\u201d He read the text with a frown. \u201cHe says Canadians are scary.\u201d He looked up at Zane. \u201cI don\u2019t know what that means.\u201d</p><p>Zane pulled him closer and kissed him again before bending to gather their pile of clothes. \u201cYou deal with that, then. I\u2019m going to go throw these in the wash. There\u2019s a shower and a bed in the loft upstairs if you want to get some rest before dinner.\u201d</p><p>He headed for the kitchen and what was presumably a washer and dryer near the back door.</p><p>\u201cWill it be bad?\u201d Ty called after him.</p> <p>\u201cSo very bad.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 4</p><p>Ty dozed on the couch, trying to recuperate from his trek to Texas, while Zane did whatever the hell it was Zane did when Ty wasn\u2019t paying attention.</p><p>He was vaguely aware of his surroundings, not quite comfortable with the unfamiliar sounds just yet. The ceiling fan high above, the dryer whirring in the kitchen, Zane\u2019s occasional footsteps on the creaking hardwood floors. A tiny, quiet breath.</p><p>Ty cracked open an eye.</p><p>Just inches from his nose was a pair of large Hershey brown eyes. They were accompanied by long dark lashes and ringlet curls that framed a cherub\u2019s face. Said cherub was wearing a yellow sundress, red bows in her hair, and red shoes. She stared at him, her hands clasped behind her back as she turned her shoulders back and forth.</p> <p>Ty looked at her for another moment, disconcerted. \u201cHi,\u201d he said, voice still hoarse with sleep.</p><p>She gave him a frown that looked familiar. Zane\u2019s niece was three or four, if Ty remembered correctly. \u201cYou\u2019re a stranger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d Ty unfolded his arms where he\u2019d had them wrapped around his chest and let his broken hand extend toward her. \u201cI\u2019m Ty. Are you Sadie?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, still mistrustful.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a princess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that right?\u201d</p><p>She stepped closer and leaned on him, pushing her sharp elbows against his chest. He gasped. She was so close that he almost had to go cross-eyed to look at her.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m a princess and I got a pony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah?\u201d Ty looked around the room, trying to find an adult who might be responsible for the little girl\u2014aside from himself. There was no one. He looked back at Zane\u2019s niece, bewildered by her sudden appearance. How long had he been asleep? \u201cWhat color is your pony?\u201d</p><p>A scowl appeared on her face. \u201cIt\u2019s a pink pony.\u201d She started twirling a curl around a finger.</p><p>\u201cA pink pony? Are you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI turned it pink with my wand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know how to ride a pony?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Do you know how to ride a pony?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do!\u201d</p><p>Ty looked toward the bank of windows and beyond at the deck, trying to find Zane. And there his partner stood, leaning on the banister and grinning at him through the window. Alongside Zane was a slim female of Zane-like origin, matching grin and all.</p><p>\u201cWant to see?\u201d</p><p>Ty returned his attention to Sadie. \u201cNot really, no.\u201d He dropped his voice to a confidential whisper. \u201cI\u2019m scared of ponies.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes went wide. \u201cScared of ponies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery scared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be okay, don\u2019t be scared.\u201d She petted his face, her sharp little fingers barely missing his eye. He couldn\u2019t fend her off, so he just squeezed his eyes shut to protect them. Suddenly, she grabbed his face between two tiny hands and pulled until they were nose to nose. \u201cDo you want to play with me?\u201d she asked, her voice full of hope and her eyes wide.</p><p>\u201cSadie, remember we\u2019re just here visiting,\u201d the woman called out as she stepped through one of the open French doors. Ty recognized her voice: it was Zane\u2019s sister, Annie. \u201cLeave Ty alone and come give Uncle Z a hug. It\u2019s time for us to go see Granddaddy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Mommy, Ty is going to play with me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you can convince him to play, then that\u2019s just fine. After dinner.\u201d</p><p>Sadie hugged Ty\u2019s head closer. \u201cBut I want to play now!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSadie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a Sadie, I\u2019m a princess!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, you\u2019re a princess,\u201d Annie said as she came closer. \u201cYou\u2019re Princess Doesn\u2019t Listen. Hand out the hugs and let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Sadie looked back at Ty, batting those long lashes at him. She put her hands together under her chin. \u201cPlease, will you play with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh Lord,\u201d Ty laughed. \u201cSweetheart, I\u2019ll do whatever you want me to after dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYay!\u201d She jumped up and down, then lunged at him and wrapped her arms around his neck. Ty gasped in surprise, and then she was gone, darting over to the deck doors to throw herself into Zane\u2019s arms for a hasty embrace. He laughed as he picked her up, hugging her close even as she struggled to get down again.</p><p>Ty sat up and watched them, smiling faintly. He\u2019d rarely seen Zane interact with a child, and Zane was always uncomfortable when he did. He didn\u2019t appear to be now, though, and it was an odd feeling to watch him with the little girl.</p><p>Annie smiled and walked over to Ty, offering her hand. \u201cWelcome to the C and G. It\u2019s great to meet you in person.\u201d</p><p>Ty stood to shake her hand. It was hard with just the tips of his fingers poking out of the plaster cast, and he kept forgetting to offer his left hand when he was surprised with a handshake. He felt like an idiot giving the weak finger shake, but what could he do?</p><p>\u201cYou sure pulled out all the stops with the welcoming committee,\u201d he said, gesturing toward her daughter.</p><p>\u201cIf it makes you feel better, she\u2019s like that with everyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a little sparkplug,\u201d Ty drawled. He looked at Zane again. He had Sadie propped on his hip, watching her with a smile as she chattered about her pony that she insisted was pink.</p><p>Annie laughed. \u201cYou have no idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMama, I want to see my pony,\u201d Sadie announced.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your pony\u2019s name?\u201d Zane asked as he set her down.</p><p>\u201cPink Pony!\u201d</p><p>Annie laughed at the expression on Zane\u2019s face. Ty glanced at her, but found his eyes going back to Zane.</p><p>Zane shook his head and kissed Sadie\u2019s cheek. \u201cShe\u2019s your pony. I guess you can name her what you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUncle Z had a pony named Tortilla,\u201d Annie told them.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a silly name for a pony,\u201d Sadie said with a frown.</p><p>Zane shot Annie a look before glancing at Ty. Ty smiled warmly when their eyes met. Zane looked back at Sadie. \u201cAll right. Go see Pink Pony, and I\u2019ll see you for dinner at Granddaddy\u2019s house, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay!\u201d she answered, hugging Zane around the leg before running for the door.</p><p>\u201cDid you say good-bye to Ty?\u201d Annie called after her.</p><p>She didn\u2019t stop running, merely blew him a kiss over her shoulder and followed it with a trailing, \u201cBye!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee you guys later,\u201d Annie said with a wave before jogging after her runaway.</p><p>When they were gone, peace and quiet again descended. Ty watched the door for a minute longer, and then looked at Zane with a raised eyebrow. \u201cWow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry she woke you.\u201d Zane moved close and slid his arms around Ty\u2019s waist. \u201cShe promised to stay quiet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve seen that type before. She\u2019ll never be quiet again.\u201d</p><p>Zane laughed.</p><p>Ty put his hands on Zane\u2019s shoulders. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, I love the creepy feeling of waking up to someone staring at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you get any rest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome. You?\u201d He gave Zane a tug and started backing toward the couch.</p><p>Zane went along, keeping his arms around Ty. \u201cI sat and stared at you while you slept.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook who thinks he\u2019s funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019re here,\u201d Zane said as he held tight to Ty and rested his chin on Ty\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI just came to get a hat.\u201d</p><p>Zane laughed and kissed him, bending him backward just enough to force him to hold onto Zane so he wouldn\u2019t fall. It made the butterflies start churning in his chest. He loved when Zane did that to him.</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019re in luck,\u201d Zane said against his lips. \u201cI know just the place to find one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow far away from dinner are we?\u201d Ty asked roughly.</p><p>\u201cFormal dinner\u2019s at eight. Drinks beforehand. So we\u2019ve got about thirty minutes. What have you got in mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just wondering if anyone else would be stopping by to look through those big-ass windows or if I could ride you down here on the couch,\u201d Ty said, forcing his voice to sound nonchalant. Zane\u2019s breath caught on a sharp exhale, and Ty plucked at one of the buttons of Zane\u2019s shirt. \u201cToo bad I don\u2019t have a hat, though. Can\u2019t ride without a hat.\u201d</p><p>Zane caught Ty\u2019s good hand and placed it on his chest. \u201cSure you can.\u201d</p><p>Ty tried not to smile as he met Zane\u2019s eyes. \u201cBetter safe than sorry, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one else will come by,\u201d Zane growled. Then he shrugged and added, \u201cAnd if they do . . .\u201d</p><p>The invitation tugged at Ty, and he took a deep breath as he mulled it over. He didn\u2019t want Zane to come out to his family by being caught in a reverse cowboy on the couch, but the idea had its merits all the same.</p><p>Ty\u2019s body was responding, anyway.</p><p>He exhaled to calm himself, kissing Zane again as Zane finally straightened up and loosened his hold. They both knew thirty minutes wasn\u2019t enough time.</p><p>\u201cZane?\u201d Ty said, voice more serious. \u201cWhat do you plan to tell your family about us?\u201d</p><p>Zane stared out the bank of windows for a few moments before looking back at Ty. \u201cI\u2019d like to tell them the truth. Can I rent Chester, do you think?</p><p>Ty laughed and pushed his fingers through Zane\u2019s hair, fighting against the bout of nerves that fluttered through him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to tell Annie, for sure. She already knows about me; it\u2019s just telling her about you. I think . . . I hope Dad would be okay with it. He\u2019s pretty laid back.\u201d Zane rubbed his cheek against Ty\u2019s shoulder like he could burrow deeper. \u201cIf I had a choice, I wouldn\u2019t tell Mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll follow your lead. I don\u2019t mind telling them we\u2019re just partners if it makes your life easier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Zane whispered. \u201cBut I\u2019m tired of easy. Like you said, we deserve better.\u201d</p><p>Ty kissed the side of his mouth, then ducked his head for more.</p><p>Zane\u2019s grip tightened on Ty\u2019s hips until it was almost painful. \u201cI love you, Ty. More than anything.\u201d He took a deep breath, as if steadying himself. \u201cBut it\u2019d be smarter to wait until things have settled down here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you think is best.\u201d</p><p>Zane nodded, looking drawn and worried. Ty slid his fingers down his lover\u2019s face. He knew where the stress was coming from.</p><p>Zane rested his head on Ty\u2019s shoulder and Ty rubbed a hand down his back. \u201cLet\u2019s go get ready.\u201d</p><p>Zane held on tight. \u201cNot letting go,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Ty drew out the word with a frown. \u201cBut that\u2019s going to make dinner awkward.\u201d</p><p>They drove down the private road that serviced the Carter Garrett Ranch, arms hanging out the windows. The land was wide open on both sides, surprisingly green with those strange, knobby little hills and scrub trees, dotted with cactus flats and brush. It seemed tame, but Ty could see just how difficult it would be to traverse, either on foot or in a vehicle.</p><p>The land wavered with heat, even as the sun descended. Summer evenings in Texas were apparently blazing hot right up until the sun went down, when they became merely uncomfortably warm.</p><p>Zane was so quiet that the silence started getting to Ty, who fidgeted and squirmed more and more. He took his baseball hat off and messed with the bill, then put it back on and removed his sunglasses, wiping them clean before putting them back on and finding something else to mess with. He moved the air vents around and fiddled with the radio buttons, flipping through station after station of static before turning it off altogether.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t I supposed to be the nervous one here?\u201d Zane asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019m going to say something that screws things up for you,\u201d Ty admitted as he slouched down in his seat and propped his booted foot on the dashboard.</p><p>\u201cYou? Say something untoward? You would never!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, smartass, make fun of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust be yourself, Ty,\u201d Zane said, glancing over and offering him a warm smile. \u201cI don\u2019t care what you say to Mother and neither will anyone else.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your mom\u2019s deal?\u201d Ty took his sunglasses off again and frowned down at them. They had scratches he hadn\u2019t noticed before.</p><p>Zane snorted. \u201cShe\u2019s just . . . very determined.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo are you, but you aren\u2019t a frigid bitch. Usually,\u201d Ty added as he slid his sunglasses back on and scrunched up his nose when they wouldn\u2019t fit right. The frames seemed to be bent.</p> <p>\u201cUgh.\u201d Zane shook his head and slowed the truck to pass over a burbling creek. The wheels hit a metal grate in the road, jarring the vehicle. It wasn\u2019t the first grate Ty had seen; they were all over the main roads too. And while he\u2019d been walking up the driveway he\u2019d stopped to stand on one and look down into it, thinking they all might be over water or something. There was nothing under most of them.</p><p>\u201cWhat are those?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTexas gates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re cattle guards. They keep the livestock from passing over them. We call them Texas gates.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCows won\u2019t cross those?\u201d Ty glanced over his shoulder to look at the receding grate. It went from one side of the road to the other, met on both sides by the creek bed. Most were flanked by barbed wire fencing.</p><p>\u201cCows won\u2019t even cross bridges. But nothing else will cross the cattle guards either. Sheep, goats, pigs. The grates are far enough apart that their feet go through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you use them instead of gates you have to open and close. Smart.\u201d Ty glanced over at Zane and plucked a wad of cotton out of the end of the bright green cast on his arm. \u201cSo, wait, do those ring the property? Is that how the trespassers are gaining access?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably. Stop messing with it.\u201d Zane said as he swatted at Ty\u2019s hands. \u201cI don\u2019t want to take you back to the damn emergency room to have another put on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou realize I\u2019ll be cutting this thing off with my Strider in about two more days, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou cut that thing off, Grady, I will break your other hand.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou can try, Hoss.\u201d</p><p>Zane was quiet a long moment as he stared out the windshield.</p><p>Soon enough, Ty was drumming his fingers against his leg. The truck topped a small rise and the main ranch sprawled in front of them. Three massive barns, two corrals, miles of white fencing leading off over the hills, and the three-story white colonial-style house that towered over the spread. Ty hadn\u2019t taken the time to look around when he\u2019d arrived this morning, too concerned with seeing Zane and finding air conditioning to think of anything else. It was an impressive sight.</p><p>He began whistling \u201cHome on the Range.\u201d</p><p>Zane shot him a glare and reached out to thump his chest. \u201cAsshole,\u201d he said as he steered into the drive.</p><p>\u201cOw!\u201d As soon as Zane put the truck in park, a man walked out of the barn. \u201cIs that your dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is he doing out here?\u201d Zane opened the door and headed toward the barn, and Ty trailed along behind him at a safe enough distance to give them privacy if they needed it.</p><p>\u201cDad. You\u2019re supposed to be resting.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI am resting.\u201d</p><p>Zane motioned with his hands, reminiscent of the way Ty would flail sometimes. Ty bit his lip to keep from smiling. Every once in a while he noticed something like that: evidence that they were beginning to pick up characteristics from each other.</p><p>\u201cI needed to get out of the house,\u201d Harrison said, aiming a pointed look at the beautiful mansion.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Zane glanced at Ty, uneasy.</p><p>Harrison nodded and reached into his pocket for a pouch of tobacco and rolling papers. \u201cShe\u2019s planning the Steers and Stripes fundraiser. On the warpath.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re fucking kidding me. She\u2019s still having it here? What part of \u2018trespassers with guns\u2019 does she not get?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAppearances are everything. And watch your language,\u201d Harrison added, shooting a tired smile Ty\u2019s way.</p><p>Ty frowned and moved closer. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery Fourth of July we hold a barbeque fundraiser. We should cancel it after what happened, but my wife refuses.\u201d</p><p>He began packing a cigarette with experienced fingers. Ty opened his mouth to say something, but then closed it again with a frown.</p><p>\u201cUntil we learn more about what\u2019s going on, there\u2019s no way that party should happen,\u201d Zane spat.</p><p>Ty reached out and set his hand on Zane\u2019s shoulder. \u201cCalm down.\u201d</p><p>Zane looked back at him, fuming.</p><p>Ty squeezed his shoulder. \u201cWe\u2019ll sit down and take a look at the problem, see what we can do. The fourth is like a week away; this might not even be an issue by then. And if it is, holding a big party here might turn out to be helpful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you figure?\u201d Zane asked. Any good the last few hours may have done him was gone; he\u2019d turned edgy and combative in what seemed like the blink of an eye. Zane\u2019s mother must have been a real piece of work for the mere mention of one of her ideas to have this effect on Ty\u2019s normally stoic partner.</p><p>Ty glanced at the bright red front door of the mansion and then met Zane\u2019s eyes with a small smile. \u201cIt\u2019ll be okay,\u201d he said, voice soft and calm.</p><p>Zane stared at him for a long moment, then rolled his shoulders and began to relax again. \u201cYou\u2019re right. No need to get worked up. Yet.\u201d</p><p>Harrison whistled and drew Ty\u2019s attention from Zane. \u201cThat\u2019s impressive, son,\u201d he said to Ty as he watched Zane. He put a hand around Ty\u2019s shoulder and pulled him close. \u201cYou ever tried to break a horse? I bet you\u2019d be real good at it.\u201d</p><p>Zane laughed on his way to the truck, but Ty wasn\u2019t quite sure he understood the joke. He shook his head and glanced at Zane\u2019s father. \u201cI\u2019m not all that fond of horses, sir.\u201d</p><p>Harrison looked amused. \u201cWe don\u2019t stand on ceremony here, Ty. Call me Harrison.\u201d He patted Ty\u2019s shoulder and released him. \u201cBesides, Z already told me you could be a real son of a bitch.\u201d</p><p>Ty narrowed his eyes at Zane. \u201cReal son of a bitch, huh, Z?\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s eyes widened as he came closer, carrying a box he\u2019d retrieved from the truck bed. He obviously hadn\u2019t heard what had preceded his nickname. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJackass,\u201d Ty said to him. Harrison laughed.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d I do?\u201d</p><p>Ty gave him a wink.</p><p>Zane rolled his eyes. \u201cI got you something in Austin. I was going to bring it home, but since you\u2019re here . . .\u201d He handed Ty the box.</p><p>Ty took it with a quirked eyebrow at Zane and a sideways glance at Harrison. But Zane wouldn\u2019t have given it to him here if it were something . . . dubious.</p><p>He pulled the top off the box and peered inside to find a felt cowboy hat, light brown with a black band. On the front of the band was a beautiful silver and turquoise concho.</p><p>Ty laughed and pulled the hat out. \u201cThanks, Zane.\u201d</p><p>Zane plucked off Ty\u2019s baseball cap, then took the hat out of his hands and set it on top of his head. Zane fussed with it, making sure it fit right, and Ty stared at him from under the brim of the hat, watching Zane\u2019s dark eyes go darker.</p><p>\u201cLooks good,\u201d Zane said with a curt nod, the undercurrent in his voice unmistakable. It must have looked pretty damn good.</p><p>Ty gave him a jaunty grin. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wear that like you\u2019re from Texas,\u201d Harrison said, nodding his approval.</p><p>They heard a shout from inside the house: Beverly on the phone in her study, where an open window let in the evening breeze.</p><p>\u201cOh, kill me now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t be that bad, right?\u201d Ty asked, looking between Zane and his father.</p><p>\u201cOptimists are so cute,\u201d Harrison said around his cigarette.</p><p>Ty did a double-take, and Zane grunted. \u201cGod help the poor party planner she\u2019s dealing with.\u201d He sighed and jerked his hand. \u201cBut better her than me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s your mother,\u201d Ty said, voice low. \u201cNext time she gets on your case, you do what all good sons do and lie to make her happy.\u201d</p><p>Zane looked up sharply, blinking. Harrison threw his head back and laughed again. Ty merely raised an eyebrow at Zane. His hat shifted with the motion.</p><p>Harrison patted Ty\u2019s shoulder, shaking him with surprising vigor for a man who\u2019d just been released from the hospital with a bullet hole in his arm. \u201cI like this one, Z.\u201d</p><p>Zane smiled gamely.</p><p>\u201cYou boys don\u2019t tarry, now. Dinner\u2019ll be on soon,\u201d Harrison said, then made his way back toward the house, sliding what was left of his rolled cigarette into his pocket.</p><p>They waited until he was out of earshot, and then Zane stepped closer. \u201cYou got any idea what she gets on my case for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>Zane stared at him for a long moment. \u201cShe wants me back here, running the ranch, married again, with kids. Like a good Texan boy. And to hell with what I want.\u201d He took another step, until their chests brushed together. Ty had to tilt his head back to keep the brim of his hat from poking one of Zane\u2019s eyes out. \u201cI\u2019ve got other ideas of what I want,\u201d Zane said quietly.</p><p>Ty nodded, glancing around the yard out of habit, then looking at Zane with an odd rush of nerves.</p><p>Zane tipped his head to one side, studying him. \u201cI think you might be able to see the problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see it,\u201d Ty whispered. He sniffed as he looked around the yard again. \u201cWhat is that smell?\u201d</p><p>Zane shook his head. \u201cWhat smell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmells like horse.\u201d</p><p>Zane snorted, and Ty turned to move toward the front porch. Zane chuckled. \u201cIt\u2019s a ranch, Ty. Dad\u2019s got whole barns full of horses. Better check your boots, buddy boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll find one up your ass soon enough,\u201d Ty promised as he walked away. Zane\u2019s laughter followed him across the yard.</p><p>They got halfway through dinner before Beverly brought up the topic Zane was desperately wishing she\u2019d avoid.</p><p>\u201cZane, when are you going to come back here and settle down? Surely you\u2019ve gotten this government nonsense out of your blood by now,\u201d she said as she passed the gravy to Annie, like it was an everyday conversation.</p><p>\u201cNow, Beverly, you know Z\u2019s worked hard to get where he is. He can\u2019t just drop it,\u201d Harrison said.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t just up and leave my assignment, Mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurely you can request a transfer or retirement.\u201d Beverly turned her eyes on Zane\u2019s silent partner sitting across the table from Zane. \u201cCan you do that, Mr. Grady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, look,\u201d Ty said, as if he\u2019d just discovered something wonderful. \u201cBiscuits!\u201d He tore off a piece of bread and stuffed it into his mouth.</p><p>Annie snickered, and Zane kept his eyes on his plate as he tried not to smile. Even Sadie began giggling, looking around the table with eyes that shone. She was sitting next to Ty, mimicking his actions. Ty looked sideways at her and winked.</p><p>Beverly drew a breath to continue, but Harrison spoke first. \u201cSo what is it you\u2019re doing now, Z? You must like it pretty well.\u201d</p><p>Zane looked at Ty before speaking. \u201cWe do a lot of investigative work. Research and field work, stuff like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cResearch,\u201d Beverly sneered.</p><p>\u201cMother, not right now, okay? We can talk about it later.\u201d</p><p>Ty pressed his lips into a thin line and kept his eyes on his plate, obviously trying to keep from saying anything. But then he glanced up at Zane\u2019s mother, brow furrowed, and then at Zane. He was probably tying his tongue in knots trying to restrain himself from weighing in.</p><p>The whole thing made Zane angry. And then there was Ty, here to support him and being forced to sit through Beverly\u2019s cutting remarks. She had yet to address him by any of the titles he\u2019d earned, instead calling him Mr. Grady. Zane glanced up and met his partner\u2019s eyes.</p><p>Ty raised one eyebrow pointedly. \u201cLie,\u201d he mouthed.</p><p>Zane\u2019s jaw clenched. \u201cI\u2019d been thinking about it.\u201d</p><p>Silverware clattered as both Annie and Harrison looked at him in surprise, and Beverly broke into a smile. \u201cWell, you merely had to say so, Zane. We can talk all about it sometime this week. Now, Juanita, what do we have for dessert?\u201d</p><p>The matronly little woman hovering nearby bustled off toward the kitchen, and Beverly surveyed the dinner table with a smile.</p><p>Eyes wide, Zane stared at her and then Ty in disbelief.</p><p>Ty pressed his lips together again, clearly trying not to laugh as he ducked his head and tightened his grip on his fork. Zane kicked Ty\u2019s shin under the table, and Ty gave a muffled grunt and jerked before he could stop himself, clanging his fork and plate together.</p><p>Harrison looked up, his lips twitching. \u201cOkay there, Ty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d Ty answered with a grimace. \u201cBad leg. Old football injury. Tripped over the water boy. There was Gatorade everywhere, it was horrible.\u201d</p><p>Annie began giggling again, and even Zane grinned as Juanita came back in with a tray of churros and bowls of sweet dips.</p><p>As Sadie dove into the desserts with all the enthusiasm of a three-year-old, Beverly placed her napkin on the table at her elbow, leaning forward and watching Ty. Ty seemed to sense the attention and he looked up, meeting Beverly\u2019s eyes.</p><p>Zane\u2019s stomach flipped. His likened his mother to a wild animal sometimes; if you made eye contact, it was like a challenge. But Ty always made eye contact, and he didn\u2019t back down from challenges. Watching his mother and his lover stare at each other was the proverbial irresistible force meeting an immovable object.</p><p>\u201cSo, Mr. Grady, how did you find yourself in the FBI?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s Agent Grady, Mother.\u201d</p><p>Ty gave her a charming smile. \u201cThe Marines didn\u2019t want me, and it\u2019s hard to find a job where you can shoot things without getting arrested.\u201d</p><p>Zane actually groaned.</p> <p>Beverly was struck speechless for a moment, and Ty took advantage to change the subject. He looked around the table, addressing Harrison and the others.</p><p>\u201cSo, what exactly has been going on? Can someone fill me in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Harrison started.</p><p>\u201cDo we really need to talk about such nasty business at dinner?\u201d Beverly asked. She still sounded flustered, and Zane couldn\u2019t decide if it was unsettling or amusing. His mother didn\u2019t like it when things were out of her control; that was where their similarities began.</p><p>\u201cYour husband was shot on your own property. Doesn\u2019t that make you a little angry?\u201d Ty asked.</p> <p>\u201cMade me angry,\u201d Harrison mumbled as he sipped at his water.</p><p>\u201cOf course it\u2019s upsetting,\u201d Beverly snapped. She straightened and cleared her throat daintily, then looked to Harrison. \u201cDon\u2019t you believe we should wait until Mark is here to discuss it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMark won\u2019t be here until tomorrow, Mother,\u201d Annie said.</p><p>\u201cStill. I believe we should wait for him. He does have a military background, after all. And don\u2019t we need someone with a mind for this sort of thing before we go off half-cocked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother, really. Zane and Ty do this for a living.\u201d</p><p>Zane opened his mouth to tell her about Ty\u2019s background, but he felt the tip of Ty\u2019s foot at his shin. Ty shook his head and smiled.</p> <p>\u201cHarrison?\u201d Beverly said, ostensibly deferring the decision to Zane\u2019s father, despite her warning tone.</p><p>Harrison sighed and nodded. \u201cProblem\u2019s been going on for a good while now. I think we can afford one night to give Ty here a chance to rest before we put him to work for us.\u201d</p><p>Zane smiled, impressed with his father\u2019s quiet diplomacy. He looked at his partner and found Ty watching Harrison, head cocked. Ty nodded. \u201cI appreciate that, sir, thank you.\u201d</p><p>Harrison smirked knowingly.</p><p>Beverly wasn\u2019t as impressed with her husband\u2019s decision as Zane was, but she let it go at that. It was like watching a shark release its hold, and something in Zane began to relax.</p><p>She placed her napkin on the table and stood. \u201cNow if you\u2019ll excuse me, I have plans to attend to in the study.\u201d</p><p>She left the formal dining room, and Zane watched the doorway for a long moment. He reminded himself it would just be a few more days, and then they\u2019d be out of here.</p><p>\u201cWell, that went well,\u201d Ty finally said, sounding far too chipper about it.</p> <p>\u201cLie to her, Zane, it\u2019ll help,\u201d Zane grumbled in a high-pitched mockery of Ty\u2019s drawl.</p><p>Ty chuckled.</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of lying,\u201d Harrison said, leaning both elbows on the table. \u201cYou two care to come clean now, while your mother\u2019s out of earshot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Zane asked, panic settling heavy in his stomach.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what it is you\u2019re both hiding, but I can smell it.\u201d</p><p>Zane swallowed hard and glanced at Ty. Ty raised an eyebrow, nodding. He looked calm, but there was no telling what was going on beneath the surface. Zane licked his lips and was surprised to find his mouth dry.</p><p>\u201cTy and I . . .\u201d He looked at his father, the fear and uncertainty skittering through him. \u201cWe . . .\u201d</p><p>Out of the corner of his eye, Zane saw the compass rose around Ty\u2019s neck. He\u2019d worn it almost every day since Zane had given it to him. He would do anything for Zane, and he deserved the same. Ty bit his lip and looked down at the table as Zane hesitated, and though Zane caught only the briefest glimpse of his lover\u2019s expression, he recognized it: disappointment. It burned its way through his body and settled uncomfortably in the pit of his stomach, pushing him toward the words.</p><p>\u201cTy and I . . . we\u2019ve been dating for about a year now.\u201d</p><p>Ty\u2019s head shot up, and Annie glanced between them, eyebrows climbing so high her bangs hid them.</p><p>\u201cDating?\u201d Harrison echoed.</p><p>Zane met and held Ty\u2019s gaze. \u201cTy isn\u2019t just my partner at work. He\u2019s my boyfriend. I love him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Harrison sounded thoughtful. \u201cWell, that explains it.\u201d He went back to cutting the churro on Sadie\u2019s plate, and Zane and Ty both stared at him, incredulous.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d Ty blurted.</p><p>Harrison shrugged and chewed a piece of the sweet bread Sadie had stuffed into his mouth. \u201cHad a gay bull I had to sell last year. That was a damn nuisance. Gay son? That don\u2019t cost me nothing.\u201d</p><p>Ty laughed before he could stop himself. He had one of those boyish, infectious laughs that made the people around him giggle too no matter why. Soon they were all laughing raucously, the sound ringing through the massive house like bells in a cathedral.</p><p>Ty stood in the foyer, looking up at an oil painting tucked away in one corner of the grand entryway. He\u2019d seen the painting before dinner, a fascinating vista of browns, oranges, and pinks that made up a surreal look at the Hill Country outside the door.</p><p>It was pleasing to the eye, and the colors were well-suited to the d\u00e9cor, so Ty couldn\u2019t understand why it had been shoved into this alcove where no one would see it unless they made a concerted effort to do so.</p><p>He cocked his head and took a sip from the wine he was trying to finish before Zane came back from talking with his father and sister.</p><p>\u201cYou like it?\u201d Annie asked as she came up behind him.</p><p>Ty turned and gave her a confused smile. \u201cIt seems familiar to me and I\u2019m not sure why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you a connoisseur of art?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHardly. I\u2019m more a photograph person, if anything.\u201d He cocked his head the other way, examining the colors and brush strokes. There was an element of profiling to looking at a painting if you knew enough about art, but Ty didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re familiar with the artist.\u201d Annie stopped at his side and looked at the painting with a smile.</p><p>\u201cNo, really, I can only name like five painters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet you can name this one.\u201d</p><p>Ty looked at her sharply, and then turned his eyes back to the painting. He pointed with one of the fingers holding his wine glass. \u201cZane painted this?\u201d</p><p>Annie nodded.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re shitting me!\u201d</p><p>She laughed, and Ty looked around with a wince as his words echoed off the marble floors.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s incredible,\u201d he added, quieter. He studied the painting again. Careful strokes, meticulous details that still somehow formed a sloppy likeness of the sun setting over the desert. There was calm beneath the vibrant surface, like Zane in reverse.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t know Zane could paint?\u201d</p><p>Ty shook his head, still gazing at the brush strokes.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s quite a talented artist. His charcoal sketches were heartbreakingly beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never knew he could do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven so. You recognized this as his.\u201d She patted his shoulder and Ty felt her move away. He licked his lips and set his wine glass down, eyes still riveted to the painting. He had to force himself to look away and followed her to the front door.</p><p>Annie slipped her hand into the crook of his arm. They strolled through the yard, the temperature surprisingly comfortable. It was still hot, but there was a breeze that seemed to be apologizing for the sun trying to melt them all day. Ahead of them, Zane and Harrison were trailing along behind Sadie, who was fluttering like a butterfly, chasing lightning bugs.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you tease him like you do?\u201d Annie asked.</p><p>\u201cYou want the real answer or the one I\u2019d give his sister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe real one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough. Because I enjoy it,\u201d he said with a sideways glance. \u201cAnd so does he.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo . . . foreplay.\u201d</p><p>Ty barked a laugh.</p><p>\u201cAnd the answer you\u2019d give his sister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, I\u2019d have had to stall to come up with one. Probably would have tripped you or something.\u201d</p><p>Annie laughed. \u201cWell, Ty Grady, I bet he has his hands full with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, I hope so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad he has someone. I worried about him for so long.\u201d</p><p>Ty nodded, his mood turning more somber. They walked in silence a moment, and Zane and Harrison slowed their pace until he and Annie came abreast of them. Harrison was moving well, but seemed to tire quickly. He had his hand on Zane\u2019s arm, and when they caught up he took Annie\u2019s arm instead, freeing Zane to fall in next to Ty. Sadie was a few dozen yards away, dancing, twirling, and skipping around the yard.</p><p>They ambled along, content in the silence. Ty stopped and stared as the sun melted into the ground ahead of them.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s spectacular.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s bigger in Texas,\u201d Zane whispered, a smile in his voice.</p><p>\u201cOh God.\u201d</p><p>Zane laid his chin on Ty\u2019s shoulder to watch the sunset. His familiar scent and his comforting presence were wonderful, and Ty turned his head to touch his cheek to Zane\u2019s. He was aware of how close they were in front of Zane\u2019s family, and though he was enjoying the moment, he could feel his shoulders tensing.</p><p>Harrison cleared his throat. \u201cNow, I believe we need to discuss this situation a little more seriously,\u201d he said as the landscaping lights began to flicker on around them.</p><p>\u201cYou mean, should we tell Mother that Ty and I are screwing?\u201d Zane asked, voice flat.</p><p>\u201cOh, look,\u201d Ty said. \u201cHorses.\u201d He took a step and made to escape.</p><p>Zane reached out and grabbed him by the back of the neck, and he flailed and stumbled as Zane\u2019s fingers snagged his collar.</p><p>\u201cNo wandering off, Grady. This is your problem now too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have to tell her at all?\u201d Annie asked. She looked genuinely concerned. Ty wondered how many members of Zane\u2019s family would give a damn if Zane was gay. It seemed the real problem on everyone\u2019s mind was what Beverly would do. Ty was beginning to think that perhaps all this family money was hers. If not the money, then definitely the power.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll find out through the grapevine soon enough,\u201d Zane said as Ty tried to shake him off.</p><p>\u201cWell, yes, I suppose she will,\u201d Annie said, wincing.</p><p>Harrison lit the cigarette he\u2019d rolled before dinner, and Ty gave one last swat with his cast before he stopped struggling against Zane\u2019s fingers.</p><p>\u201cYou prepared for what might happen when you mother finds out?\u201d Harrison eyed Zane\u2019s grip on Ty\u2019s collar, shook his head and smiled. \u201cLet your friend go, Z.\u201d</p><p>Zane released Ty\u2019s shirt collar, and Ty squared his shoulders and straightened his shirt, giving Zane a glare. Zane smiled serenely when he met Ty\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cI say let her find out when she finds out,\u201d Zane said. \u201cI told the important people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s the way you want to play it,\u201d Harrison said. \u201cBut I do have one question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay . . .\u201d Zane said.</p><p>\u201cNot for you.\u201d Harrison nodded at Ty instead.</p><p>Ty raised his chin and braced himself for whatever Zane\u2019s father could throw at him. After facing down his own father, he didn\u2019t think anything could scare him now.</p><p>\u201cYou know anything about horses, son?\u201d</p><p>Ty raised an eyebrow and leaned closer, not sure if he\u2019d heard right. \u201cNot much, sir,\u201d he answered. \u201cI know how to get on one, and I know how to fall off one.\u201d</p><p>Annie snickered and Harrison nodded. \u201cWell, then. I guess we can\u2019t all be perfect.\u201d</p><p>Ty narrowed his eyes at Harrison. \u201cI have a question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow in the hell do you do that with your mustache?\u201d</p><p>Harrison gave him a grin and wink as he turned away.</p><p>Zane and Annie watched in total exasperation as Ty spent most of the evening teaching Sadie how to jab a pressure point with two fingers, and where the most effective pressure points were located.</p><p>Zane could only laugh as Sadie jabbed at Ty\u2019s carotid and Ty sprawled in the grass, complete with his tongue hanging out for effect. Sadie was enjoying it a little too much. But then, so was Ty.</p><p>It was well past dark when they returned to the guesthouse and Zane finally had Ty to himself. As soon as they walked in, Zane pulled Ty toward him and kissed him, taking his time, drawing it out.</p><p>Ty grinned against his lips. \u201cHow does it feel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn good,\u201d Zane growled as he squeezed Ty\u2019s ass.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant.\u201d</p><p>Zane laughed. He didn\u2019t let Ty go, but he nodded. \u201cIt feels good. I can\u2019t believe my dad took it like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour dad is pretty epic, Zane.\u201d</p><p>Zane laughed again, harder this time. He met Ty\u2019s eyes, taking in the whole package. The hat brought out the hazel, making them sharper, shadowing them and giving Ty that mysterious cowboy aura that so many people tried and failed to achieve. Ty could almost pull off the hat better than he could and Ty\u2019d only had it for a few hours. The way Ty had handled himself tonight, the way he\u2019d charmed Annie and Harrison and even little Sadie, and held his own with Beverly, made Zane proud.</p><p>Having someone to be proud of was an indescribable feeling.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d Zane said as he gazed into Ty\u2019s eyes, reveling in the truth behind the words. Every step they took as a couple felt so damn good.</p><p>Ty smiled, eyes bright. Then his expression fell and he smacked Zane\u2019s chest. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t I know you can draw?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw your painting. And Annie said you do charcoal sketches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou are going to draw me something, and you\u2019re going to do it tonight.\u201d</p><p>Zane laughed. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should draw me a tattoo!\u201d</p><p>Zane raised an eyebrow, arrested by the thought. He hadn\u2019t drawn in years, hadn\u2019t even thought of it, but the idea of using Ty\u2019s skin as a canvas was appealing in so many ways. \u201cI might have to do that,\u201d he rasped.</p><p>Ty nodded. Zane pulled the hat off Ty\u2019s head and stepped in close to kiss at the corner of his mouth. Ty reached to tug him closer, but stopped when his cast got in the way. He couldn\u2019t grip Zane\u2019s arm, couldn\u2019t drag his hand over Zane\u2019s back, couldn\u2019t even work at any of Zane\u2019s buttons. Zane huffed in annoyance and started on his own shirt buttons.</p> <p>Ty grunted and turned his hand over.</p><p>\u201cHow much longer are you in that thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouple more weeks, at least.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s really going to cause some chafing if you\u2019re not careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cZane, come on, that\u2019s just mean.\u201d Ty didn\u2019t sound too amused, but then, a broken hand had to drive a man like Ty nuts. Especially since it was his dominant hand.</p><p>Zane looked from Ty\u2019s eyes to the cast with a sinking feeling. He knew what Ty was thinking.</p> <p>Sure enough, Ty bent and extracted the Strider at his ankle.</p><p>Zane squared his shoulders and pointed. \u201cTyler Grady, don\u2019t you dare cut that cast off.\u201d</p><p>Ty put the blade to the edge of the plaster, eyes wide and innocent, as if he were hurt that Zane would think he\u2019d do such a thing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take it from you, Ty.\u201d</p><p>Ty narrowed his eyes, then turned and took a few steps away. \u201cTry it, Lone Star,\u201d he said as he shoved the knife under the padding and started sawing at it. He hunched his shoulders when Zane took a step toward him.</p><p>\u201cTy! Do not cut that cast off!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt itches!\u201d</p><p>Zane grabbed his hand, pulling it and the knife away from the cast.</p> <p>Ty slithered away and held the knife out to the side, blade pointed away from Zane. \u201cQuit it!\u201d he said, holding out his hurt hand as if to keep Zane at bay. He stayed there for a second, a standoff as they stared at each other, then took a quick step back and began to saw at the cast again.</p><p>Zane darted close, grasped Ty\u2019s cast, and yanked it to the side, away from the knife. Ty held the knife out again, stepping closer to Zane to hinder his movements rather than trying to pull away from him. He couldn\u2019t get the cast out of Zane\u2019s grasp, though.</p><p>\u201cJust let me cut it off!\u201d Ty begged as he tried and failed to twist it free.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Zane grabbed at the knife, fully aware of\u2014and turned on by\u2014how their bodies aligned when they grappled. Just like the first fight they\u2019d ever had, a real one, where he\u2019d found himself with a raging hard-on as he\u2019d pinned Ty to a wall in an alley in New York City.</p><p>Ty shot Zane his best seductive smile. \u201cI\u2019ll do fun things to you if you let me cut it off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll do fun things to me anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDammit!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou cut it off, you\u2019ll start using it. You start using it, you\u2019ll fuck it up again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the fun of life,\u201d Ty insisted. Then he hooked his foot behind Zane\u2019s ankle and pulled his leg forward.</p><p>Zane swore as he stumbled and pitched backward toward the floor, but managed to snake an arm around Ty to pull him down with him. They both hit hard, and Zane rolled over and scrabbled at Ty\u2019s good wrist, trying to get the knife.</p><p>Ty stretched his arm as far as he could while wrapping his legs around Zane\u2019s waist and clamping down, putting the knife just out of Zane\u2019s reach. So Zane grasped Ty\u2019s arm and started beating it against the floor to dislodge the knife.</p><p>Ty struggled briefly, but then gave a plaintive, \u201cOw! Dammit!\u201d and the knife clattered to the plank floor. He yanked his hurt hand away from Zane and whacked him in the arm with the hard plaster cast.</p><p>\u201cOw! Ty!\u201d Zane shouted. He pushed down on both Ty\u2019s shoulders, pinning him to the floor. \u201cGive it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you ever known that to work with me?\u201d Ty asked wryly, attempting to roll onto his stomach even with Zane\u2019s weight pressed against him.</p><p>Zane kissed him, letting it go hot and messy, but he didn\u2019t loosen his hold. If anything, his hands gripped tighter and his knees closed against Ty\u2019s sides. Ty pulled him closer, wrapping him up, letting Zane feel his cock hardening against him.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s an illegal move,\u201d Ty panted. He closed his eyes and rested his head on the floor.</p><p>Zane chuckled and lowered himself to his elbows, rubbing his nose along Ty\u2019s jaw. \u201cSince when is any move illegal with you?\u201d</p><p>Ty pressed his mouth to Zane\u2019s. \u201cWhen it gives you the advantage.\u201d His words rumbled against Zane\u2019s lips as they kissed, and Zane moved one hand to touch Ty\u2019s face.</p><p>Ty arched his back, stretching his arms out above him on the floor. \u201dAh ah ah,\u201d Zane said as he slid his hands up Ty\u2019s arms to pull them back down. Ty twisted and Zane struggled to get him under him again. God, how he wanted him now! If Ty would cooperate, they could be fucking in a matter of minutes. \u201cJust stop it. You\u2019re not taking that cast off! And you\u2019re driving me fucking crazy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a short trip!\u201d</p><p>Zane pushed to his knees and hauled Ty up against him so he could straddle Ty\u2019s lap. He grabbed his chin and kissed him. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, shut the fuck up,\u201d he said, breathless, before kissing him again.</p><p>Ty snickered.</p><p>Zane kissed him harder. \u201cYou feel like putting that hat back on and saddling up?\u201d</p><p>Ty\u2019s breath hitched, eyes dark and cheeks flushed. \u201cOh yeah. But if you utter the words \u2018ride \u2019em cowboy,\u2019 I\u2019m done.\u201d</p><p>Zane grinned. Ty slid both hands up Zane\u2019s side, but stopped when his cast met resistance. Zane flinched as something poked him in the side.</p><p>They both shifted enough to look at Ty\u2019s arm.</p><p>The tip of the Strider had found its way into the plaster of Ty\u2019s cast, cutting through the edge, and both tip and handle were sticking out at opposite angles. It had gone completely through.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d Ty whispered as he stared at his cast, now complete with movie-prop knife sticking through it.</p><p>Zane blinked at the knife in horror and released Ty, who flopped onto his back. \u201cSon of a bitch, Ty.\u201d</p><p>Ty began to laugh again, holding his arm to the side, which was a pretty good indication that the knife hadn\u2019t actually cut him. Zane rolled his eyes, grabbed the Strider, and yanked it out. Ty howled in protest, but he was far too late. He lay there with wide eyes, looking at Zane incredulously as Zane flipped it around and around before brandishing it over Ty, not in the least bit amused.</p><p>\u201cWhat if it was in my arm, you toolbag?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you would be bleeding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t know I wasn\u2019t bleeding, you can\u2019t see the wound!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI made an educated guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa! Now I have to take it off! I could be injured.\u201d</p><p>Zane snapped the knife over and over in his hand with simple flicks of his wrist. \u201cI\u2019ll give you injured.\u201d</p><p>Ty grinned crookedly and shifted a little under Zane. \u201cBring it.\u201d</p><p>A smile pulled at Zane\u2019s lips, and without answering, he threw the knife to jam into the wooden door of the bathroom. Then he curled his fingers into Ty\u2019s shirt and drew Ty up toward him, the muscles in his arm straining.</p><p>\u201cNice toss,\u201d Ty said, but he was staring up into Zane\u2019s eyes, his expression torn between arousal and annoyance.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Ty grabbed Zane with his good hand, yanking him toward the floor as they kissed. Zane went willingly and settled on top of Ty, who spread his knees wider so Zane could sink between them, making him hotter and harder as he rutted against Ty\u2019s body. He grabbed Ty behind the neck and crushed their mouths together, his tongue invading Ty\u2019s in a messy kiss. Then he pulled back.</p><p>\u201cThe cast isn\u2019t coming off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDammit!\u201d</p><p>Zane climbed to his feet with an annoyed grunt and stalked over to the bathroom, where he jerked the Strider out of the door. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll be holding onto this for safekeeping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, no!\u201d Ty scrambled to his feet. \u201cI need to be armed, Zane. What if the horses revolt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can put that sharp wit of yours to use.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClever use of wordplay, I approve. Penalty points subtracted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give it back in the morning. Or after I\u2019ve been laid at least three times. Whichever one comes first.\u201d</p><p>Ty sighed and flopped his hands, as if the thought of having sex with Zane in return for his knife would be such a hassle.</p><p>Zane raised an eyebrow, smiling as Ty stalked closer. He jabbed the knife into the doorway again, then met Ty halfway, wrapping him up in a slow, passionate kiss.</p><p>\u201cI knew you\u2019d come around,\u201d Zane murmured.</p><p>\u201cJust shut up and undo some of these buttons.\u201d</p><p>Zane couldn\u2019t help but laugh. He did as requested, undoing the buttons of his own shirt and popping the ones on his and Ty\u2019s jeans. He let his hand settle on Ty\u2019s torso, appreciating the toned muscles under his fingers, loving the way Ty raised his arms and settled his hands on Zane\u2019s shoulders just because he knew it would make Zane tighten his hold and kiss him.</p><p>Zane loved little things like that. They\u2019d grown so familiar with each other they could give and take such cues and rarely even realize they were doing it. He occasionally found himself talking with his hands like Ty did, and once or twice he\u2019d noticed Ty sitting idly by as their coworkers argued, too mellow to involve himself.</p><p>They were good for each other in so many ways, even if foreplay did sometimes include a Strider and a sucker punch to the midsection.</p><p>\u201cZane,\u201d Ty gasped as he broke the kiss. \u201cCome back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Zane asked, confused and turned on and distracted by his tangent.</p><p>\u201cWhatever you\u2019re thinking about right now, drop it and come back.\u201d Ty emphasized the request by pushing Zane\u2019s pants down his hips.</p><p>Zane started laughing, surprised by just how funny it struck him. Ty\u2019s fingers were on his skin, sliding his boxers to his thighs, and it warmed every inch of Zane\u2019s body as he gazed into Ty\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cI was just musing over how perfect you are for me.\u201d</p><p>Ty\u2019s lips twitched into a smile. He didn\u2019t appear to have anything clever to say. His rough hand dragged across Zane\u2019s chest and he began backing toward the door where he\u2019d left his bags earlier in the day.</p><p>Zane followed him, kicking out of the remainder of his clothes. It was rare that Ty had nothing to say, no witty rejoinder, no snappy remark. It intrigued Zane, his body tingling with growing anticipation. The last time Ty had pulled the silent game was before they\u2019d left for the cruise ship last Christmas, when Ty had wanted to practice being a mind-blowingly sexy submissive. Zane\u2019s cock jumped at the mere memory of that evening.</p><p>He watched Ty saunter across the room, taking his fill of Ty\u2019s naked body, tempted to sit on the couch and touch himself to see what Ty would do. He would much rather Ty be the one touching, though.</p><p>Ty rummaged through his bag, no doubt searching for lube. Zane took a deep breath, trying to calm himself. He loved that the prospect of having sex with Ty could still make his stomach flutter like a schoolboy\u2019s and his body react like a man twenty years younger.</p><p>When Ty stood up, he had a bottle in hand. But instead of coming toward Zane, he stuck his bare foot into the cowboy hat on the ground and kicked it into the air. He caught it with his good hand and turned a mischievous grin on Zane. He didn\u2019t say anything, merely held the hat out as if displaying it. Then he flipped it and turned it around his hand, rolled it up his arm, and set it on his head with a flourish.</p><p>Zane grinned from ear to ear, not sure whether to be impressed or turned on. He was both, at this point.</p><p>He took a step back, letting his heel hit the couch behind him. He sank down onto it, slouching and spreading his legs wide as he wrapped long fingers around his cock. Ty was advancing on him, and that crooked grin from beneath the brim of that cowboy hat should have been illegal in most states.</p><p>The hat, the compass rose pendant, and the grin were the only things Ty wore now. Zane\u2019s breath came in shallow bursts as Ty climbed into his lap.</p><p>\u201cTy,\u201d he whispered as he looked up into his partner\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou told me if I ever came to Texas you\u2019d teach me how to ride,\u201d Ty drawled. The low gravel of his seductive voice never failed to hit all of Zane\u2019s happy places.</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>Ty kissed him, long and hard, forced to turn his head so the brim of his hat wouldn\u2019t interfere. Zane tried to push his hips up, but Ty wasn\u2019t sitting in his lap; he was hovering, the muscles of his thighs straining. Zane grabbed them and squeezed, enjoying the feel of Ty\u2019s hard muscles at work. Ty\u2019s hand was on him, slathering him in lube, squeezing and pulling, teasing. Zane moaned, close to blissful as Ty handled him.</p><p>He pulled Ty closer by his thighs, forcing his body to contort until he could no longer manage the kiss, and Ty\u2019s cock brushed Zane\u2019s chest as Ty arched his back and sighed. Zane scanned up his body, eyes following the smooth lines of hard muscles, a six-pack he had once licked whipped cream from, and the edge of Ty\u2019s jaw as he tilted his head back.</p><p>He was, without a doubt, the most beautiful thing Zane had ever laid eyes on. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ty looked down at him, his eyes in shadow. Zane hadn\u2019t expected to find the hat sexy, but the way Ty looked in it and nothing else was indescribably so.</p><p>Ty didn\u2019t say a word. He just shifted, his hard cock brushing Zane\u2019s chest, his hips moving under Zane\u2019s hands, his muscles flexing.</p><p>\u201cTy,\u201d Zane groaned as his lover turned in his lap. He slid his hands over Ty\u2019s ass, squeezing hard and spreading him apart with his thumbs as he massaged the muscles with his fingers. He kept his hands there as Ty straddled his lap backward and lowered himself; Zane flexed his hips, guiding him down, trying to help.</p> <p>Ty didn\u2019t just lower himself, though. He rolled his hips and arched his back, rubbing his ass against the head of Zane\u2019s cock but always missing the entry, making a show of it. He flexed his shoulders, twisting from side to side so that Zane had to work hard to force him down.</p><p>Zane found himself both turned on and frustrated by the teasing lap dance.</p><p>\u201cJackass,\u201d he said through gritted teeth.</p><p>Ty laughed.</p><p>Zane reached up to grip Ty\u2019s shoulder with one hand, exerting enough force to pull him down while his other hand kept Ty from wriggling his hips away. Ty gasped as the head of Zane\u2019s cock shoved into him.</p> <p>\u201cFuck, yeah,\u201d Zane groaned.</p><p>Ty squeezed him, and Zane watched the play of muscles as Ty rolled his hips and forced Zane further into him. Zane\u2019s hand dragged down Ty\u2019s back, sliding around his ribs to his belly. There wasn\u2019t a wasted pound on Ty, and every inch of him was hard when his body was tense. He was so much fun to fuck.</p><p>\u201cCome on, doll,\u201d Zane begged. He flexed his hips up, but Ty merely rode the motion, not allowing Zane to go deeper.</p><p>Ty looked over his shoulder, a smirk playing at his lips, his eyes shining. He reached up to pull the brim of his hat lower like some villain in an old western. Zane grinned. Oh yeah, he was in for a wild ride.</p><p>Ty rolled his hips, and Zane followed the sensual movement with his fingertips. His cock slid deeper into Ty with every roll, and he hastily reached to spread Ty apart so he could watch his thick cock plunging into his lover.</p><p>Ty moaned as Zane sank deep. It wasn\u2019t a short gasp or a surprised groan like the sounds he usually forced out of Ty when they fucked. This was a sultry, intentional sound that made all the remaining blood in Zane\u2019s body rush to his cock.</p> <p>\u201cJesus, Ty, what are you doing to me?\u201d</p><p>Ty reached back to drag his fingers over Zane\u2019s ribs. \u201cI\u2019m using you to get off.\u201d</p><p>Zane moaned as Ty started to roll his hips in circles, reaching up to find somewhere to hold. He settled one hand on a hip so he could feel Ty\u2019s intoxicating movements. The other hand he dragged up and down Ty\u2019s back as his cock plunged deep, massaged by Ty\u2019s tight muscles, surrounded by slick heat. Ty would tighten those muscles and Zane would cry out and drag his fingernails down Ty\u2019s side as he tried to buck his hips.</p><p>It was a slow build, like embers kindled deep in his belly.</p><p>Then Ty rose up, sliding those tight muscles along the shaft of Zane\u2019s cock.</p><p>\u201cYes, baby. Oh God, yes,\u201d Zane stuttered. He reached around to grip Ty\u2019s thighs, pressing his chest to Ty\u2019s back.</p><p>Ty sank down just as he\u2019d risen, shimmying his hips from side to side. His back dragged against Zane\u2019s chest.</p><p>\u201cOh, God! Please, Ty! Christ, I\u2019m begging you, go faster.\u201d</p> <p>When Ty turned his head, Zane could see he was biting his lip. \u201cI thought I was supposed to be learning some sort of lesson.\u201d</p><p>Zane groaned and tried to shove himself deeper, but Ty anticipated him and rose to his knees again. Zane growled in frustration. \u201cI\u2019ll teach you a goddamn lesson.\u201d</p><p>He wrapped his arms under Ty\u2019s, pulling him back by his chest as he sank his teeth into the side of Ty\u2019s neck. Then he thrust his hips up without letting go, and Ty shouted as he shoved in deep.</p><p>\u201cRide me now or get fucked face-first on the floor.\u201d</p><p>Ty laughed breathlessly, rolled his hips, then pushed forward and began to ride Zane\u2019s cock faster.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it, doll,\u201d Zane gasped. He gripped Ty\u2019s hips and tried to urge him to go faster, but Ty rose again, pulling Zane\u2019s cock almost completely out of him.</p><p>Zane called out and scrabbled for Ty\u2019s shoulder to keep him from going farther. The head of his cock pushed at the stubborn muscles of Ty\u2019s entrance, spreading him apart, forcing those muscles back with its girth. Ty threw his head back and moaned again. He rolled his hips around, forcing Zane\u2019s cockhead to massage him.</p><p>Zane watched with his mouth wide open, tongue touching the back of his top teeth, gasping for breath. Ty was blatant about using Zane to pleasure himself, and Zane loved every minute of it.</p><p>Then Ty sank down again, crying out as he hit his prostate. He reached back to grab at Zane, who caught his hands, sliding their fingers together, gripping him hard as Ty shimmied his hips. The sounds coming from him were debauched and downright wicked, and not one of those was calculated.</p><p>Then he started riding again, faster this time, fast enough to draw a gasp and a curse from Zane\u2019s lips. Zane still held both of Ty\u2019s hands, and he pulled Ty\u2019s arms behind his back, holding him there as if his wrists were tied together. Ty continued to ride him, moaning in approval of Zane\u2019s newest idea.</p><p>Zane pushed his hips up, bringing both of them off the couch. Ty moaned again\u2014that decadent, sinful sound Zane knew he was making on purpose. Zane\u2019s groin growing heavy and tight, pleasure spreading as Ty rode him harder and faster. His ass slapped against Zane\u2019s lap. Zane\u2019s cock slammed into him over and over.</p><p>Zane\u2019s grip on Ty\u2019s wrists tightened, and he pulled until Ty\u2019s back was arched at an awkward angle. He shoved his cock up into his lover, grinning when Ty called out his name and turned his head to try for a kiss. Zane curled and managed to meet his lips, reaching around Ty\u2019s body, gripping his cock and stroking him. How was Ty still riding him with his body so contorted? Zane was going to come inside him any second if Ty didn\u2019t hold still.</p><p>He reached up and took the hat off Ty\u2019s head, tossing it over the back of the couch, then grabbed Ty\u2019s hair, yanking his head back so he could whisper in his ear. \u201cI\u2019m going to come in you so hard you\u2019ll be tasting it.\u201d</p><p>Ty\u2019s entire body shuddered against him. \u201cYeah. Please, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to see you first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cZane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShoot your load for me and I\u2019ll throw you down on that floor and fuck you. Hard and messy, just like you want it.\u201d</p><p>Ty gave another decadent groan. Zane smacked his ass to get him to go faster, and the sound of his palm slapping skin and Ty\u2019s desperate cry nearly sent him over the edge. He forgot about the hand job he\u2019d started for Ty, and he pushed Ty to sit up straight again, gripping his hips hard.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Ty whispered, sounding relieved at Zane\u2019s loss of control.</p><p>\u201cYeah, what?\u201d Zane growled in his ear.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not calling you sir during sex.\u201d</p><p>Zane grabbed a handful of hair. \u201cRide me, Ty!\u201d he shouted, his harsh voice echoing off the high ceiling. \u201cCome on!\u201d</p><p>Ty bent forward, riding Zane with those sinuous movements of his hips, faster and faster until sparkles started to form on the edges of Zane\u2019s vision.</p><p>He grabbed Ty in a one-armed bear hug and pulled him back against his chest, restraining Ty\u2019s movements as he fought off his orgasm. Ty was breathing hard, biting his lip as he tried desperately to roll his hips. Ty leaked all over Zane\u2019s hand when Zane slid his fingers over his cock.</p><p>Zane started to stroke him with one hand, yanking that handful of Ty\u2019s hair with his other as he whispered into Ty\u2019s ear. \u201cYou better come without moving too damn much.\u201d</p><p>Ty\u2019s lips parted, but no sound came out. His head rested on Zane\u2019s shoulder, and the faster Zane stroked him, the tighter Zane\u2019s grip on his hair became. Ty\u2019s body began to contort, his breathing growing erratic and labored. Every inch of him was straining to remain still, and the restraint and the tortured look on his lover\u2019s face drove Zane\u2019s hand faster and faster.</p><p>\u201cZane!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t fucking move!\u201d</p><p>Ty\u2019s head thrashed from side to side, fighting Zane\u2019s grip as he writhed on Zane\u2019s straining cock. He finally managed to press his mouth to Zane\u2019s, and Zane returned the kiss with all the hunger and lust of a man fighting his own orgasm.</p><p>As their tongues fought for dominance, Ty thrust his hips up into Zane\u2019s hand, and he called out into Zane\u2019s mouth as he started to come. It hit both their chests and even spattered up onto their chins as Zane pumped Ty\u2019s cock.</p><p>Ty licked a drop of cum off the corner of Zane\u2019s mouth, and Zane\u2019s control snapped.</p><p>He released Ty only to grip Ty\u2019s hips hard, fucking Ty at his own brutal pace. His movements were so powerful and out of control that he nearly tossed Ty to the floor. Then he grabbed Ty and did shove him to the floor. They both hit hard, Ty\u2019s hands still trapped between them, and Zane lined up quickly and pushed his cock past those tight muscles without giving Ty a moment to recuperate. Ty bucked under him, fighting back against the hard fucking in a way he knew would drive Zane insane. Ty\u2019s cries and shouts and curses turned into begging. Begging Zane to take him harder, begging Zane to come all over him, begging him for more of everything.</p><p>Zane went at him harder and faster, pulling completely out and then forcing himself back in. When Zane started to come, the first spurt spilled out over Ty\u2019s ass before Zane could shove back into him. He continued like that, coming inside him and all over him at the same time, pulling out only to shove past a pool of his own cum, watching himself shoot against Ty\u2019s ass and knowing he was filling him up inside, too.</p><p>Zane\u2019s shout, primal and wordless, echoed off the high ceiling. Ty kept moving, his muscles sliding under Zane\u2019s hands, moaning as Zane made a mess of it.</p><p>When Zane\u2019s body finally gave in, he collapsed against Ty\u2019s back and pressed his face against him, licking at the sweaty skin.</p><p>Ty hummed, his hands still trapped between them like he really was restrained that way. He craned his neck for a kiss and Zane was more than happy to oblige: he took Ty\u2019s hands in his, pinned them to the floor, then leaned over him for a languid kiss. Ty\u2019s ass pushed against him as Ty contorted, his body asking for more.</p><p>It didn\u2019t happen often, but sometimes Ty sank into this submissive mindset, and Zane took advantage when he could. It shocked him how good Ty was at playing the submissive when he was so dominant at other times.</p><p>Just the thought of Ty being in one of those moods had Zane wanting to fuck him all over again. Snugged up against Ty\u2019s ass, surrounded by his own cum, didn\u2019t hurt the urge either. Zane flexed his hips, wondering how long they could stay like this until he was ready to go again.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s gotten into you?\u201d Zane asked, whispering in Ty\u2019s ear.</p><p>Ty gasped and shuddered beneath him. \u201cBesides you?\u201d</p><p>Zane ran his hands over Ty\u2019s hard muscles, the smell of sweat and sex and Old Spice helping to convince his body that it could indeed take Ty at least one more time tonight.</p><p>\u201cBesides me.\u201d</p><p>Ty grinned, rolling his hips to spur Zane along. \u201cMust be the Stetson.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 5</p><p>\u201cI wonder where Dad went.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably got tired of the horse smell,\u201d Ty grumbled. He was watching Zane work from his perch on the edge of one of the stalls, his feet dangling. Zane was having a hard time keeping his eyes off him.</p><p>He\u2019d missed the routine of the ranch, and he was enjoying getting his hands dirty again. Brushing down the horses certainly beat loitering inside under Beverly\u2019s watchful eye until Mark arrived.</p><p>\u201cUncomfortable?\u201d Zane asked, smirking.</p><p>Ty darted a glance at the horse Zane was brushing. \u201cThey keep . . . looking at me.\u201d</p><p>Zane looked at Ty for a long moment, trying not to laugh. \u201cLooking at you,\u201d he managed to say.</p><p>Ty gave the horse a wave. \u201cLook at him! It\u2019s like he knows something.\u201d</p><p>Zane snickered, and the horse mimicked him with a whicker, which just made Zane laugh harder.</p><p>\u201cThat shit\u2019s not funny, Zane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgree to disagree,\u201d Zane crooned.</p><p>\u201cHello the barn!\u201d The call echoed from somewhere behind them.</p><p>Ty perked up like a hunting dog on a new scent, and Zane straightened from brushing the horse and peered down the barn\u2019s center aisle. \u201cIn here!\u201d</p><p>A lean man in a cowboy hat was walking toward them. The sun shone into the barn behind him, turning him into a faceless silhouette.</p><p>Ty tensed and looked over his shoulder to watch the man approach. He was always on edge in unfamiliar territory.</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m looking for\u2014\u201d The man stopped several feet away, where his face came into view. \u201cZ? Damn, I thought you were your daddy.\u201d</p><p>Zane stepped toward the stall door. \u201cMark. Been a while.\u201d</p><p>Mark Masterson pulled off his hat. His blond hair underneath was shorn almost into a crew cut, and his goatee was neatly trimmed. He gave Zane a hug and then stepped back, blue eyes shining. Zane waited, apprehensive. Mark wasn\u2019t exactly an open-minded individual, though he was a decent enough guy. Annie hadn\u2019t been certain how he\u2019d take the news that Zane was involved with a man, but they\u2019d decided to tell him up front and let the chips fall where they may.</p><p>\u201cAnnie, uh . . . told me about what I missed at dinner.\u201d</p><p>Zane straightened, squaring his shoulders.</p><p>Mark turned his head to look Ty up and down. Ty stared at him, unmoving, until Mark met Zane\u2019s eyes and nodded. \u201cI\u2019m just glad to see you happy again, Z. We were worried for a long while it wouldn\u2019t happen.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Zane exhaled the breath he\u2019d been holding. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Mark looked at Ty and nodded, offering his hand. \u201cMark Masterson.\u201d</p><p>Ty shook with his left hand, still wary.</p> <p>\u201cTy, this is Annie\u2019s husband. Mark, this is my partner, Ty Grady.\u201d</p><p>Ty looked Mark up and down. Zane had seen him do it many times, but he always enjoyed watching Ty\u2019s gears turn. \u201cSemper fi,\u201d he said to Mark with a small smile.</p><p>Zane\u2019s brow jumped. \u201cHow\u2019d you know he was a Marine?\u201d he blurted.</p><p>Ty grinned enigmatically at him, and Mark laughed. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t understand, Z,\u201d Mark said. He nodded at Ty again. \u201cWelcome to Carter Garrett Ranch, Ty Grady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you the Ty Grady? From Camp Lejeune?\u201d</p><p>At that, Ty grew even more tense and quiet. It was unlike Ty in so many ways. What was this undercurrent between them about? And it was astonishing that Zane\u2019s brother-in-law had heard of Ty before. What kind of badass Marine had Ty been to have his name known by people he\u2019d never met?</p><p>Ty nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew that name sounded familiar. I remember hearing it quite a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you did,\u201d Ty said with a small, mirthless laugh.</p><p>\u201cYou were Second Recon, right?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI was.\u201d</p><p>Mark nodded sharply, then glanced sideways at Zane. \u201cRecon squads at Lejeune when I was there were a crazy bunch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe had our moments,\u201d Ty said, voice low and careful. It sent a chill up Zane\u2019s spine, the type that often preceded wanting to be pinned to the ground and fucked to within an inch of his life. Somewhere along the line, he\u2019d come to terms with the fact that the more dangerous Ty seemed, the hotter he was. Zane had no regrets.</p><p>Mark nodded. \u201cWell, it\u2019s a pleasure to meet you. Will y\u2019all be staying awhile?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil we get something settled with Dad\u2019s attackers. We\u2019ll be around. We were waiting for you to show before we gathered on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, then. Hey, a couple of us are heading to the roadhouse later tonight. You two game?\u201d</p><p>Zane cast a glance at Ty, who nodded. \u201cYeah, sounds fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust, uh . . . fair warning. Word\u2019s already got around the C and G about you two. Won\u2019t be long before it gets out. Hope you\u2019re ready for that.\u201d</p> <p>Zane fought against the butterflies. \u201cReally? That was faster than I expected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well. The last remaining Garrett starts doing a guy, it makes the rounds.\u201d</p><p>Zane laughed despite himself. He hadn\u2019t thought of it that way, but he supposed it would cause a stir, considering he had no kids and was therefore the last Garrett in a long line of them.</p><p>Mark turned to go. \u201cWe\u2019re ready when you are.\u201d</p><p>Zane nodded, but he was watching Ty.</p><p>\u201cTy?\u201d he said after a few seconds.</p><p>Ty tore his eyes away from Mark and met Zane\u2019s eyes. \u201cHmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>Ty nodded curtly. \u201cJust wasn\u2019t expecting to be recognized.\u201d</p><p>Zane wanted to ask why it bothered Ty, but he\u2019d save it for later. \u201cYou ready to head inside?\u201d</p><p>Ty pushed off the gate and landed light as a cat in the dirt. \u201cWas that true, what he said? Are you the last Garrett?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s right, that\u2019s going to cause a stir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care. Do you?\u201d</p><p>Ty shook his head. Then he gave the horse one last mistrustful glance. \u201cLet\u2019s do this,\u201d he said with a huff. He turned toward the barn doors. \u201cIt\u2019s about damn time I hear what\u2019s been going on.\u201d</p><p>They walked side by side toward the house. Zane slid his hand into Ty\u2019s back pocket. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m sorry for keeping you in the dark, but I figured the less I told you, the better you\u2019d be able to look at it through new eyes. I want to see if you can find an angle all of us are missing.\u201d</p><p>Ty rolled his eyes. \u201cNo pressure.\u201d</p><p>They gathered in the drawing room to brainstorm and fill Ty in on the details. Ty and Zane sat on the edge of Beverly\u2019s desk, their shoulders brushing.</p><p>\u201cHave you had any land grabs in the area? Redistricting? Minerals, oil? Any reason to try to run you off your ranch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, nothing like that,\u201d Harrison answered.</p><p>\u201cThe land is the only thing I can think of that makes sense,\u201d Ty said, casting a troubled look at Zane.</p><p>\u201cYou want to take a look at it?\u201d Zane asked.</p><p>Ty nodded, so Zane retrieved a map of the area from a bookcase along the wall and laid it out on the desk, smoothing it as they all gathered around it. The family knew it by heart, but Ty bent over the map and studied it closely. He pointed at a square in the middle. \u201cThis is the big house, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t call it that,\u201d Beverly snapped. She\u2019d made it abundantly clear that she thought this was all a waste of time.</p><p>\u201cThe large structure in which you live, then?\u201d Ty said, one eyebrow raised. Zane had to look away so Beverly wouldn\u2019t see him smile, and Annie and Mark both coughed as they examined the carpet.</p><p>Zane cleared his throat and picked up a pen. He drew a circle around the house, then several other spots on the map. \u201cThis is the main house. The guesthouse where we\u2019re staying is here, and this is the entrance off the main road.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Where did your dad get shot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was out near the old pump house,\u201d Harrison answered.</p><p>Zane traced his finger along the line of the map and found the general area where the old shed was that housed the ancient spring and pump. He marked it with an X. What was Ty seeing, looking at it from a fresh angle? Zane could trace the lines and ridges of the property with his eyes closed, but that wasn\u2019t always the best way to find something you were missing.</p><p>\u201cPump house? Is there still water there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Mark said. \u201cThe underwater river that fed it has moved on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid it leave behind caverns? Pockets of open space or caves?\u201d</p><p>Mark and Annie shared a glance. \u201cSomething like Hamilton Pool?\u201d Annie asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a swimming hole,\u201d Zane said. \u201cHuge collapsed cavern from an old underground river. Dripping Springs, the town I told you about? There are water features all over the place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s possible there\u2019s something out there under the map, somewhere dark and cold.\u201d</p><p>Zane met Ty\u2019s eyes with a hint of pride and nodded. \u201cPerfect for temporary storage in the Texas heat.\u201d</p><p>Ty nodded. \u201cDo you have a bigger map? One that shows the surrounding areas and the water?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get it,\u201d Mark offered. He went to the bookshelves and came back with a topo map that he laid on top of the first one.</p><p>Ty bent over it, staring at it long enough for the group to grow restless.</p><p>\u201cWhat is this green area here, on the edge of the map?\u201d Ty finally asked, brushing his finger over the spot. \u201cIt passes within a few miles of where he was shot. Is it state land? A national park or something?\u201d</p><p>Zane sucked air through his teeth and clucked his tongue. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to like it.\u201d</p><p>Ty eyeballed him, then the others. \u201cWhy, what is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the animal sanctuary,\u201d Beverly said with a sniff. She\u2019d never been a fan of the place.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the what?\u201d Ty asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a big cat sanctuary,\u201d Annie said. She edged closer and looked at the map. \u201cIt\u2019s been there for about fifteen years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBig cat?\u201d Ty repeated, his voice going flat.</p><p>Zane was torn between wanting to laugh and wrap Ty up in a hug.</p><p>\u201cYeah. They take in exotic animals that have been abused or abandoned or rescued. Most of them are big cats, though I think they take in other types when they can.\u201d</p><p>Ty stared at her, his jaw tightening. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe big cat population in the states almost outnumbers those in the wild. They need somewhere to go. There are dozens of sanctuaries all across the country, a lot of them right here in Texas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy so many here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, because Texas laws about exotic animals are very loose. For the most part, they\u2019re awful, but it means the sanctuaries can move freely where they can\u2019t in other states. The cats need all the help they can get.\u201d</p><p>Ty glared at Annie for a minute, then looked back at the map. \u201cI hate Texas.\u201d</p><p>Annie leaned toward Ty. \u201cSorry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. So, all this green on the map here is the second circle of hell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFur and . . . stripes and . . . teeth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Zane managed to answer without laughing.</p><p>Ty frowned hard. \u201cDoesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat doesn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I was assuming your land was being used either as a storage dump or a delivery highway, and if someone found a cavern down there, it\u2019s perfect. But it\u2019s so damn out of the way, it reads more like a point of origin than anything. If this section that abutted it was park land or some other sort of protected area, that\u2019s where I\u2019d think the factory would be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFactory?\u201d Beverly asked, mouth twisted as if she hated to be curious but was anyway.</p><p>\u201cHe means if it was drugs,\u201d Zane said. \u201cA protected place like a national park would be a good place to manufacture them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Ty said, eyes still glued to the map. \u201cThe same goes for human trafficking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re a bit far from the border for that,\u201d Zane said.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t work, either. There\u2019s no reason to use your ranch to make anything, and certainly not to stash live bodies en route. It\u2019s too remote, too far from the trade routes, and too well-utilized.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrade routes. You\u2019re talking like this is some sort of seafaring business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt pretty much is,\u201d Ty said to Beverly. \u201cTrucks are like ships, taking cargo all over the country. Very profitable. But they take the same routes because they know the ins and outs. They don\u2019t stray to new territory often. It\u2019s too risky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s horrid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what Zane deals with, Mother,\u201d Annie said, her voice cold.</p><p>Beverly cast a glance at her daughter before brushing off the admonition. \u201cIf it is neither drugs nor this . . . human trafficking, as you call it, and you believe it wasn\u2019t a mere case of trespassing, then what do you propose it is?\u201d</p><p>Ty chewed on his lip and looked back down at the map.</p><p>\u201cTy? You have an idea?\u201d Zane placed his hand on the small of Ty\u2019s back, trying to urge him to speak.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not really sure if I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry us.\u201d</p><p>Ty shrugged. \u201cAnnie, you said exotic animal laws in Texas were different than most. How so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that have to do with this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHumor him,\u201d Zane said.</p><p>\u201cWell, Texas law allows for the ownership, sale, and breeding of exotic animals. Like I said, it\u2019s hardly regulated. It\u2019s barbaric.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd other states do regulate it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat makes exotic animals a commodity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess you could call it that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it big money?\u201d Ty asked. \u201cExotic animals?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I guess so,\u201d Annie said. \u201cPeople will pay thousands for a tiger or lion, especially on the black market, but legally as well. They\u2019re kept as a sort of status symbol. And they\u2019re used for income. Circuses, traveling entertainment, private zoos. Not to mention their pelts being worth thousands.\u201d</p><p>Ty nodded and glanced at Zane. Zane raised an eyebrow. \u201cWhat, you think this is about exotic animals instead of drugs or sex trade?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think . . . maybe someone should pay a visit to that place and see if any of their animals are missing.\u201d</p><p>Zane studied the map. The sanctuary abutted the ranch and passed within two miles of the pump house. He smiled ruefully and shook his head. He never would have even considered it.</p><p>\u201cMakes more sense than anything we\u2019ve come up with yet,\u201d he said, and he reached for the corner of the map to begin folding it back up.</p><p>\u201cYou kids go on, then,\u201d Harrison said. \u201cCheck out that place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, hell no,\u201d Ty blurted. \u201cI mean, no, sir. Hell no, sir.\u201d</p><p>Zane chuckled. \u201cCome on, Ty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? No. Not me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChicken,\u201d Zane whispered.</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s what they think I taste like.\u201d</p><p>Zane laughed harder.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t do big cats, Zane.\u201d</p><p>Annie held up a hand. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, why aren\u2019t you going to the sanctuary?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has an unnatural aversion to large felines,\u201d Zane told her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not unnatural, Zane. It would be unnatural if I weren\u2019t afraid of something that tried to eat me.\u201d</p><p>Annie smiled gently. \u201cThey\u2019re nothing to be afraid of. Big cats rarely attack humans.\u201d</p><p>Ty turned his glare on her, but before he could speak, Mark barked a laugh. \u201cAnd here I thought the famous Tyler Grady wasn\u2019t afraid of anything.\u201d</p><p>Ty glared at Mark for a moment, then at Zane, crossing his arms over his chest. \u201cScrew you all, I\u2019m not going.\u201d</p><p>Zane and Annie stepped into the lobby of the big cat preserve, but Ty balked, freezing on the welcome mat. It had a black and orange Bengal tiger face on it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt smells like death in here.\u201d</p><p>Annie took his arm and smiled. \u201cI\u2019m sure that\u2019s just the bleach they use on their habitats. Come on.\u201d</p><p>She dragged him over the threshold, and Zane followed with Mark, trying not to laugh.</p> <p>A woman in khaki pants and a \u201cSave the Kitties\u201d T-shirt met them in the lobby and shook their hands.</p><p>\u201cYou must be the ones who called earlier. I\u2019m Tish.\u201d</p><p>Ty offered his left hand to shake, and when she took it, she immediately gripped it with both hands and pulled it to her face to look closer.</p><p>Ty stumbled and watched her with wide eyes, too dumbstruck to say or do anything.</p><p>\u201cWhat was this, puma concolor?\u201d she asked as she examined the scar on his hand.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA mountain lion? A cougar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is stunning. Cougars are more closely linked to smaller felines than to large jungle cats, most people don\u2019t realize that,\u201d Tish rambled as she turned Ty\u2019s hand over and over to look at the faded, jagged scars.</p><p>Zane often found his own fingers tracing the tooth marks and surgery scars on Ty\u2019s hand when they were lying in bed. The pattern was hypnotic, in a way, and one more reminder that Ty was a fighter of the highest order. The only reason he\u2019d lived through that attack was because he was too stubborn to die.</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t usually attack humans. Were you feeding her at the time?\u201d Tish asked.</p> <p>\u201cI was . . . trying not to,\u201d Ty said. He gaped at Zane, silently asking him to do something.</p><p>Zane patted his shoulder. \u201cWe think he got too close to her babies or she was defending her territory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, or he just wasn\u2019t hungry cause he\u2019d already eaten a dude right before me.\u201d</p><p>Tish practically bounced. \u201cThis is just awesome, we don\u2019t see many bite marks that nicely preserved. I mean, not on living things. You were lucky she was just playing with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were actually bitten by a cougar?\u201d Mark asked.</p><p>Ty grunted, and Zane squeezed his shoulder to keep him from saying anything more.</p><p>Tish let his hand go and smiled. \u201cAnyway! How can we help you? Were you here for a tour? It\u2019s a little unorthodox on a weekday on such short notice, but it can be arranged, especially for neighbors who\u2019ve been so kind to us.\u201d</p><p>Zane smiled and shook his head as he pulled out his badge and showed it to her. Ty did the same, although more grudgingly. \u201cActually, we\u2019re here in an official capacity. We were wondering if you\u2019ve had any break-ins. Any animals go missing recently?\u201d</p> <p>Her eyes widened as she looked at the badges, and she nodded. \u201cWe have. Two residents are unaccounted for. Have you found them? We\u2019ve been worried sick about them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, no. Were they reported?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, of course. We reported them to the local animal registration agency and local law enforcement, as per the state statute\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Ty interrupted. \u201cHow do you know they\u2019re missing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, they\u2019re not in their enclosures anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s . . . really?\u201d Ty asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat my partner means is, um . . . do you tag them in any way? So you can track them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, the residents are never intended to be off the property. Tagging them would be costly, traumatic, and redundant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, they\u2019re in cages, you said? How does a lion or tiger get out of its cage?\u201d Ty asked.</p><p>\u201cWe call them habitats or enclosures. Each one has a double gate, where we can lock the cat in one section and clean the other safely. We believe one of the interns may have improperly latched the gates after cleaning or feeding, but . . . we take such precautions, I just don\u2019t see how that could have happened. I mean, both gates?\u201d</p><p>Ty and Zane shared a look. It was looking more like Ty\u2019s theory might be correct. Ty\u2019s eyes strayed past Zane to the wall behind him, and he began to drift toward it to look at a large, colorful map of the preserve grounds.</p><p>\u201cThe preserve has a perimeter fence?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does. A backup measure for this very thing. We searched for days, but we have over one-hundred acres. I\u2019m sure the tigers are still on grounds; we simply don\u2019t have the manpower for a concerted search. We\u2019re still looking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMa\u2019am, we don\u2019t believe that to be the case,\u201d Zane said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA week ago, the owner of the C and G, the ranch that borders the preserve, was shot just a mile or two from one of your boundaries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, dear!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe think he witnessed a catnapping.\u201d Ty managed to say that with a straight face. Zane had to fight back a snicker.</p><p>\u201cYou think someone came in and stole our cats?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you found any perimeter breaches?\u201d Ty asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Tish brought a hand to her neck. \u201cReally, we just thought they\u2019d come home once they got hungry. We\u2019ve all been on the alert.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, \u2019cause tigers are completely helpless when they want food,\u201d Ty muttered as he looked back at the map.</p><p>\u201cHow tight is your security?\u201d Zane asked.</p><p>\u201cWell . . . our security is more for the safety and containment of the animals, not to keep people out. The border fences are electrified. Each habitat has a lock on it that requires a key.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about this building?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA standard alarm system.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre there any night guards? Caretakers for the animals?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are six to eight interns on staff throughout the year. They all stay in the dormitory area. I can show you. Someone took the cats, didn\u2019t they? To sell them? Oh my God.\u201d Tish clapped her hands to her face, looking so distraught that Zane wished he had better news for her.</p><p>Annie patted her shoulder. \u201cIf anyone can find them, it\u2019s my brother.\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s breath caught at the flow of surprise and warmth filtering through him. Ty brushed his elbow, a discreet showing of pride or support.</p><p>\u201cCan you tell us what species are missing?\u201d Ty asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Tish swiped a hand over her forehead. \u201cThey were two white Bengal tigers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBengal tigers?\u201d Ty repeated.</p><p>\u201cYes. A male and female. Hansel and Gretel.\u201d</p><p>Ty leaned in to whisper to Zane. \u201cThose are the big-ass ones, Zane.\u201d</p><p>Zane nodded.</p><p>\u201cActually, the Siberian tiger is bigger,\u201d Tish said, babbling faster and wringing her hands. \u201cMost people think white tigers are Siberians, but they\u2019re usually a mixture of the two. The white gene comes from the Bengal, but they do tend to grow bigger than the orange ones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, very large tigers,\u201d Zane said. Tish nodded and smiled weakly.</p><p>\u201cI fucking hate Texas,\u201d Ty hissed in Zane\u2019s ear before turning back to Tish with a charming, fake smile.</p><p>Tish led them through the grounds, between large holding pens filled with every imaginable species of big cat and the trappings of keeping them healthy and happy. There were over forty habitats. Most were at least fifty feet square, with soaring cages that went over twenty feet high. They had inside and outside areas, with platforms as high as thirteen feet up, built around trees and hills. There were plastic playhouses and igloos, fake ponds with burbling waterfalls, tires on the ground and hanging from the trees, and debris that had probably once been rubber toys.</p><p>Leopards, cheetahs, lynx, tigers, cougars, bobcats, servals, and lions occupied the habitats, along with one small raccoon-like creature that lay curled protectively inside a hollow log, as if it smelled the fact that it was the only omnivore in the place.</p><p>Zane kept an eye on Ty as they moved through the facility. He felt sorry for his partner, sort of, but he was also amused. Ty seemed to have developed an extra nervous twitch the closer they got to the animals. Not that Zane could blame him.</p><p>When they passed a mountain lion named Duke, Ty skirted around the cage, putting Mark between the chain link and him. He didn\u2019t look at the cat, and Zane grew concerned when he saw Ty shifting his weight from side to side, like he might be ready to bolt. His fingers constantly played with his USMC signet ring, and several times Zane saw his hand drift toward the gun in his holster. Zane frowned. Maybe he\u2019d pushed too far, forcing Ty to come with them. He put his arm around Ty\u2019s shoulders and squeezed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I made you come.\u201d</p><p>Ty took a deep breath and nodded. \u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d</p><p>They followed Tish as she told them about each occupant in loving detail. Each cat had a tragic beginning, and Zane found himself lingering over the plaques that displayed their names and how they\u2019d been rescued.</p><p>They walked past a pair of large jaguars up a tree, one black, one spotted. Green eyes tracked them from on high as sinuous tails flicked through the air.</p><p>Zane was beginning to feel more and more sympathy for Ty as the hairs on the back of his neck stood on end.</p><p>They continued on, through winding pathways and up shady hills until they topped out on a plateau. The habitats were larger here, and further back sat sheds that housed equipment. The first enclosure they came upon on the plateau held a spectacular creature, one of the most beautiful Zane had ever seen up close: a white tiger.</p><p>\u201cBaihu is a cross between a Bengal and a Siberian,\u201d Trish said, slowing as they crossed in front of the new enclosure. \u201cWhite tigers are prized among collectors, but they\u2019re not at all rare like people think. Most are inbred for the recessive white gene and have certain health issues. If you look closely, you\u2019ll see that Baihu is cross-eyed. And I must warn you, he\u2019s quite aggressive, so when you pass by you may want to give him a wide berth.\u201d</p><p>Ty muttered under his breath as they walked between Baihu\u2019s fence and the fence of a small lynx named Zelda. Zane watched him closely, so focused on Ty that he was only dimly aware of a movement to his side. By the time he was able to turn his head, all he could see was the massive white tiger rushing at them, teeth bared. It leaped, hitting the fence with a growl. The chain rattled. Teeth gnashed at the chain link and claws hooked through it as the weight of the tiger\u2019s massive body swung the fence back and forth.</p><p>Annie screamed and ducked behind Mark, grabbing him as he flinched away. Zane stumbled back, throwing his arms up and ducking. The urge to flee was instinctive, even knowing the fence would protect them.</p><p>Tish was laughing, obviously accustomed to seeing that reaction when Baihu charged.</p><p>Zane sought out Ty as he tried to force his heart to settle. Ty stood several yards away, staring at the tiger as the animal clung to the chain link fence. He was covered in dirt like he had rolled away from the attack, and he had his gun in his hand.</p><p>\u201cTy,\u201d Zane yelled, \u201cdon\u2019t shoot the tiger!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe started it.\u201d Ty continued to stare at the tiger, and the tiger at him.</p><p>Zane pointed at him in warning. If Ty went bonkers in this place, Zane was leaving him here.</p><p>Ty glared at him, but then handed over his weapon without Zane having to ask for it. Zane shoved it into his pocket.</p><p>\u201cWay to leave the rest of us hanging, there, Grady,\u201d Mark said as they moved on.</p><p>\u201cMark,\u201d Annie hissed.</p><p>Ty grunted. \u201cGuy with a gun, I\u2019m your man. Big white tiger with teeth, it\u2019s every steak for himself.\u201d</p><p>Zane ran his hand down Ty\u2019s back, trying to comfort him.</p><p>The next enclosure held two orange Bengal tigers roughhousing in a playground of ponds, tires, and large blue barrels.</p><p>\u201cThis is Barnum and Bailey,\u201d Tish said, a hint of pride in her voice.</p><p>They gathered at the fence to look in, and Tish gave a short whistle. The two tigers looked up and started barreling toward them. These two weren\u2019t attacking, however, but cavorting. They threw themselves against the fences, gnawing on the chain link, grunting and making sounds that seemed pretty happy to Zane\u2019s ear.</p><p>\u201cThat noise they\u2019re making is called a chuff,\u201d Tish said. \u201cOnly tigers can make it; it\u2019s sort of like their version of a purr. Barnum and Bailey are brothers. Inseparable. They came to us earlier this year. Barnum is the one with the limp ear. We rescued them from a\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCircus,\u201d Ty said. Surprisingly, he stepped toward the fence, as if drawn toward the two animals.</p><p>\u201cYes! How did you know? They\u2019ve been around people since they were young and they\u2019re quite friendly. They love to roughhouse\u2014just don\u2019t let one of them get behind you or they\u2019ll think you\u2019re playing tag.\u201d Tish put her hand out and let one of the tigers lick her fingers through the fence. \u201cAnd you do not want to play tag with a tiger.\u201d</p><p>Zane glanced at Annie and Mark, then met Ty\u2019s eyes. Ty shook his head. There was no way they were getting him to stick his fingers in that fence. Annie stepped closer, though, putting a tentative hand out. The tigers grew still, watching her approach, and then sniffed at her cautiously. Bailey gave her fingers a nudge with his nose, but neither animal seemed thrilled by her.</p><p>She backed away. Mark took a hesitant step forward, and Barnum made a sound in the back of his throat that nearly triggered Zane\u2019s most primal instinct to turn and run.</p><p>\u201cThen again, maybe not,\u201d Mark mumbled. He stepped behind Annie and hid there.</p><p>\u201cTry it, Zane,\u201d Annie whispered.</p><p>Zane reluctantly moved forward, holding his hand out. The tigers reacted much as they had to Annie, sniffing him and staring. Not the type of reaction that would inspire him to jump in there and wrestle with them.</p><p>Barnum began to stalk along the fence, toward where Ty was trying to hide.</p><p>\u201cOh God, why did I come here?\u201d Ty whispered as he took a step back. The tiger leaned its heavy body against the fence, and the entire cage rattled with his weight. He rubbed his face against the chain link, looking at Ty as if inviting him to rub him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSpecial Agent Grady, you have a real way with animals,\u201d Tish said. \u201cLook, he likes you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, so did the last one,\u201d Ty said under his breath. He reached out his hand, though, tentatively as if forcing himself, and pressed it to the fence with a shiver. The tiger rubbed his nose against Ty\u2019s palm, trying to edge around so Ty would rub his ear. Ty stared at the tiger for a moment, but then pushed his fingers through the fence to scratch at the bottom of Barnum\u2019s floppy ear. Barnum plopped down and threw his head back, basking in the attention. He started chuffing again, purring on every exhale.</p><p>Tish laughed and clapped her hands. \u201cUsually it\u2019s Bailey who makes friends. Barnum rarely warms so quickly.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReally,\u201d Zane said, eyes on his partner.</p><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019ve never seen Barnum react that way! Perhaps you could come back and spend some time with him. We love to give the animals human contact when we can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrong tree to bark up,\u201d Zane said, though he watched his lover with a fond smile.</p><p>Ty was scratching under Barnum\u2019s chin, a half-smile on his face. He finally withdrew his fingers, and they moved on. Barnum followed them, eyes on Ty, making a variety of sounds, like he was trying to talk to them. When they passed the end of his enclosure, the tiger stood on his back feet and propped himself on the fence, grasping at the chain link as he watched them walk away. Ty glanced back at him, and Zane knew the look in his partner\u2019s eyes. He had a feeling they might be back here after all.</p><p>\u201cGo on,\u201d Ty said to the tiger, waving a hand at it.</p> <p>The tiger made a grunting sound and dropped back to all fours, then sat and watched them walk away.</p><p>When they reached the final pen, where Hansel and Gretel had been housed, Ty and Zane circled the exterior once, looking for any evidence of a break-in. But the hard-packed dirt was so full of footprints and wheel tracks it was impossible even for Ty to follow their story.</p><p>Zane shivered as a lion roared in the distance.</p><p>Ty knelt to examine the lock on the door. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t been picked.\u201d</p><p>Zane turned to Tish. \u201cHow many people have access to the keys to these cages?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, every staff member and intern has a master key. In case of emergencies, of course.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cInterns stay on the premises?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long are they here?\u201d Ty asked.</p><p>\u201cSix-month stints. Most of them go on to work at zoos. Some stay here.\u201d</p><p>Ty dragged his fingers through the dirt, then stood. \u201cWhat sort of preparation do they need for the internship?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost are getting their Master\u2019s degrees.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, not an easy thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhen did this batch get here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast month. Why?\u201d</p><p>Ty and Zane shared a look. That was when the problems had started.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to need a list of all your employees,\u201d Ty said. \u201cEspecially the interns.\u201d</p><p>Tish pressed her hand to her chest. \u201cYou don\u2019t think someone who worked here would do this, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything\u2019s possible,\u201d Zane said. At this point, even she was a suspect.</p><p>Ty peered off toward the east. \u201cHow far are we from the perimeter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, roughly half a mile. We try to pad the cages with some acreage, just in case.\u201d</p><p>Ty smiled gamely and nodded.</p><p>\u201cWhat are these numbers at the bottom of all the plaques?\u201d Annie asked, pointing at the plaque for Hansel and Gretel.</p><p>\u201cThose are the costs of keeping them healthy and happy. The first number is monthly, the second yearly, and the last is a lifetime estimate based on a twenty-year lifespan. We rely heavily on donations. You can even adopt one of the animals to ensure it\u2019s taken care of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdmirable,\u201d Zane said. He watched his sister, who was not only a veterinarian but also an animal activist. She was heavily involved with the local humane societies, and her home was full of adopted strays.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love some information on your programs,\u201d Annie said as she and Tish headed back toward the main facility.</p><p>Mark followed them, shaking his head.</p><p>Ty stood next to Zane, looking around with narrowed eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just . . . if I\u2019m busting in here to catnap two tigers, I\u2019m going to be prepared, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlaques say these two tigers topped out over four-hundred pounds each. And you know they had to be tranquilized. They\u2019re not just going to waltz out of here on a leash.\u201d</p><p>Zane sighed. \u201cWe\u2019ll get the details on all the tranquilizers in the facility. Stuff like that is heavily monitored. If any is missing, it\u2019s a solid lead. And if there\u2019s not any missing, we might be able to canvas the local vets and suppliers.\u201d</p><p>Ty made a clicking sound with his tongue, his hands on his hips as he watched the others walk off. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll track down any SUVs or trucks the facility has on site. We also need to locate every key in the place and vet all the employees.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have absolutely no jurisdiction here,\u201d Zane warned. \u201cIf anyone kicks up a fuss, we\u2019re done.\u201d</p><p>Ty nodded. \u201cWe\u2019ll cross that cattle guard when we get there,\u201d he said, then headed off after the others.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to ride a horse to do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d</p><p>Zane hung back, watching his partner go. Something about the way Ty moved\u2014the roll of his shoulders, his easy gait\u2014had always reminded him of a large cat in the wild. Ty fit in here more than he\u2019d probably want to admit. Zane smiled and hurried to catch up.</p><p>When they walked past Barnum and Bailey\u2019s cage, Barnum shadowed Ty the entire way. Ty let his fingers slide against the chain link, stopping to rub the tiger\u2019s ear as he went. Barnum chuffed and threw his heavy body against the fence.</p><p>Zane smirked. Either Ty was taking a page out of Deuce\u2019s book and trying some exposure therapy, or he had just fallen hard for a tiger.</p><p>Chapter 6</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand what any of this has to do with tigers,\u201d Beverly said as they sat around the dinner table. \u201cAnd I certainly don\u2019t understand why Mr. Grady needs to be here to offer wild theories.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother . . .\u201d Zane scowled. He\u2019d known she\u2019d be rude, but he hadn\u2019t expected it to embarrass him. He met Ty\u2019s eyes, and Ty smiled and winked at him.</p><p>\u201cMother, you should have come with us today,\u201d Annie said. \u201cThe sanctuary is beautiful. And Ty and Zane were like real FBI agents, flashing their badges and asking questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are real FBI agents,\u201d Zane told her with a smirk.</p><p>\u201cYou say potato . . .\u201d</p><p>Zane rolled his eyes.</p><p>\u201cSo, two of their tigers are missing,\u201d Harrison said as he cut into his steak. \u201cAnd you think what I saw was someone stealing them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d Ty and Zane said in unison.</p><p>\u201cHuh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRidiculous,\u201d Beverly hissed.</p><p>Zane met Ty\u2019s eyes across the table. It was an odd theory, but well within the realm of possibility. Exotic animals were a big trade.</p><p>Ty nodded and gave Zane another smile. He seemed to have sensed that Zane was uncomfortable and embarrassed, and he kept trying to reassure him. He held Zane\u2019s gaze for another few seconds, then looked down at his own plate. The cut of steak he\u2019d been given was at least twenty-four ounces. It filled almost his entire plate.</p><p>Ty pointed his knife at it. \u201cYou Texans really take your steak seriously, huh?\u201d</p><p>Everyone at the table stopped eating to stare at him. He glanced around and cleared his throat, smiling that self-conscious half-smile that made Zane want to do unseemly things to him.</p><p>Ty poked his steak with his knife. \u201cDid this one have a name, or . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTy, shut up and eat your steak,\u201d Zane said with a smirk.</p><p>Ty nodded and started in on it. After their initial burst of conversational effort, they ate the majority of the meal in silence. It wasn\u2019t a comfortable one like the dinners in West Virginia.</p><p>When most of their plates were empty, Mark put down his fork and asked, \u201cSo, what do we do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d Zane asked through a mouthful of food.</p><p>\u201cAbout the cat thing. How do we handle it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we could take it to the local authorities.\u201d Ty shook his head, so Zane added, \u201cBut they\u2019ll probably laugh at us at this point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need more,\u201d Ty agreed. \u201cI\u2019d like to go out to the spot and look around, see if we can get something solid. Check the ground for cave entrances.\u201d</p><p>Zane nodded.</p><p>\u201cWhat do cave entrances have to do with tigers?\u201d Mark asked.</p><p>\u201cNot a damn thing.\u201d</p><p>Mark raised an eyebrow at Ty.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll gather the boys and head out there tomorrow,\u201d Harrison said.</p><p>Beverly\u2019s fork clattered to her plate. \u201cHarrison, I forbid all of you to go rampaging over the ranch, wasting time that should be spent in more lucrative endeavors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRein it in, Beverly,\u201d Harrison said, calm as ever. He didn\u2019t even look up, just kept eating.</p><p>Beverly inhaled noisily and glanced at Ty as if it was all somehow his fault. Ty either didn\u2019t see it, or he ignored it. The urge to defend his lover was getting stronger, but Zane pushed it down.</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t take but a few hours to ride out that way,\u201d Harrison said. \u201cWe\u2019ll take it easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Ty looked up from what remained of his food. \u201cDid you say \u2018ride\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Harrison nodded.</p><p>\u201cOn a horse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat other kinds of things do you ride?\u201d Zane asked.</p><p>Ty glared at him. He licked his lips, and Zane had to look away before his body could react any further.</p><p>Harrison either missed the double entendre, or he was ignoring it. \u201cWe\u2019ll give you a trail horse, Ty, you\u2019ll never know she\u2019s there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I think Ty and I need to call it a night if we intend to ride tomorrow,\u201d Zane said. He pulled his napkin out of his lap and set it on the table.</p><p>Harrison nodded between bites of mashed potatoes. \u201cMeet here for breakfast,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t y\u2019all want to go out with us tonight, Z?\u201d Annie asked. Her eyes were shining like she knew Zane was counting the seconds before he could get Ty in bed. \u201cCody and Joe are coming, and I think Marissa and Jill said something about wanting to see you.\u201d</p><p>Zane glanced to Ty, willing his partner to decline the invitation with something creative and convincing.</p><p>\u201cCan I wear my hat?\u201d Ty asked.</p><p>Zane rolled his eyes, smiling despite the wave of irritation. \u201cYeah, you can wear your damn hat.\u201d</p><p>Zane looked a lot more relaxed now that they\u2019d escaped the big house and his mother\u2019s cutting commentary, but he still shot Ty an annoyed glance as he drove.</p><p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t have just said you wanted to be dragged back to the house and fucked, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know that was an option!\u201d</p><p>Zane laughed and returned his attention to driving.</p><p>They idled as Mark got out and opened up the impressive gate, but they didn\u2019t wait once they hit the main road. The truck following them stopped, and either Cody or Joe got out to close the gate before continuing on. They cruised with the windows down, the night air still warm and smelling of dirt and grass. It was a peaceful drive until Zane steered the truck into a gravel lot packed with vehicles.</p><p>Before them stood a large, two-story clapboard building lit with neon beer signs in every window. Strings of red chili pepper lights lined a porch crowded with tables and patrons. In the back lot, half visible from their parking spot, sat a handful of battered, vintage Airstream trailers of various sizes that gave the whole thing a very North Texas, you\u2019re-about-to-be-abducted-by-aliens vibe. A banner hanging on the front of the building proclaimed half-price drinks for members of the armed services. A vintage porcelain sign near the road advertised cold beer and air conditioning.</p><p>Ty could see how that would be a commodity in Texas in the summer.</p><p>Zane found a parking spot, and when he turned off the engine, they could hear the music blaring out of the honky-tonk. Zane grinned. \u201cThis is more my speed.\u201d</p><p>Ty looked out the window at the garish d\u00e9cor. \u201cYou and me both, darlin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>The flickering and flashing lights reflected in the mirrors and windows, splashing shards of color across Zane\u2019s face. He pulled the keys out of the ignition, pocketing them before turning to dig behind the bench seat of the pickup. He leaned back with a sharp-looking black Stetson that he settled on his head.</p><p>Ty burst out laughing, clapped a hand over his mouth, and snorted loudly as he tried to stop himself. Zane just grinned and winked, obviously not surprised by Ty\u2019s reaction.</p><p>\u201cOh, Jesus,\u201d Ty mumbled behind his fingers. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I still can\u2019t get used to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt goes with the boots.\u201d</p><p>Ty shook his head, hand still over his mouth. Zane glared at him. The hat settled well on his head and shaded his eyes from the light. \u201cWatch it, Grady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr what, Sheriff? Showdown at high noon?\u201d He lost his hold on his composure and laughed harder.</p><p>Zane grinned, lowering his head until the hat shaded his eyes. Ty had to admit, the man could pull off a cowboy hat. He chuckled and shook his head, reaching out to cock the hat and give Zane a more rakish air.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s yours?\u201d Zane asked, still smiling from under the brim of the hat.</p><p>\u201cI left it at the house.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou were so determined to wear it, and you left it behind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not Yosemite Sam; I\u2019m not used to grabbing my hat every time I go out the door!\u201d</p><p>Zane rolled his eyes, then held up his index finger in a \u201cwait\u201d sign and turned to reach behind the seat again. He pulled out a straw bullrider hat and offered it to Ty.</p> <p>Ty laughed and took the hat, turning it over to inspect it.</p><p>\u201cNo, wait. That\u2019s just like yours at home. Here,\u201d Zane said, and then he pulled the Stetson off his own head and set it on Ty\u2019s with a flourish.</p><p>Ty went cross-eyed as he looked up at the brim of the hat. Zane was staring at him, teeth worrying his lower lip, eyes dark and liquid.</p><p>\u201cI think the black suits you more than the brown did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBrings out your eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what you look for in cowboy hats?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. You know, in high school, if a girl got a guy to give her his Stetson, it was a sure thing they were going steady,\u201d Zane said, his voice heated and smug.</p><p>Zane\u2019s attempts at flirting were a never-ending source of amusement. And damn him, they were starting to work. \u201cYou saying I\u2019d make a great Texan girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m saying you look damn good in my hat,\u201d Zane growled. He cupped Ty\u2019s chin with one hand and leaned over in the shadowed truck cab to kiss him.</p><p>Ty had to give him points for effortlessly ducking under the brim. He smiled into the kiss, giving Zane more points for the ability to kindle that low-grade heat of anticipation with just a single look or kiss. Ty didn\u2019t have a smart-ass reply for that.</p> <p>The languorous kiss went on for long minutes, and when Zane finally pulled back, he ran his thumb along the corner of Ty\u2019s lips. \u201cReady to honky-tonk, baby?\u201d he drawled, voice husky with arousal.</p><p>\u201cDepends on what that\u2019s code for in Texas,\u201d Ty replied, voice just as thick.</p><p>Zane\u2019s laugh sent a shiver up Ty\u2019s spine. \u201cEvery little dirty thing you\u2019re thinking and more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s get started.\u201d Ty grinned crookedly; he enjoyed nothing more than when Zane was in this kind of mood. It usually ended up messy. With bruises. And holes in the drywall. It was a good thing they had somewhere private to return to tonight.</p><p>Zane slid the bullrider on and pulled it down low over his eyes. His hair was long enough that it curled under the brim. Ty couldn\u2019t keep his eyes off him as they climbed out of the truck. He would stay in Texas forever, as long as Zane promised to wear a hat all the time.</p><p>Their boots crunched on the gravel. Zane reached out and slid his fingers into the palm of Ty\u2019s hand. Ty looked over at him, finding it suddenly hard to breathe. He squeezed Zane\u2019s hand and Zane smiled as he sauntered toward the door.</p><p>There were fifty or more people sitting out on the patio, waiting to get a table inside. Where the hell had they all came from?</p><p>\u201cZ! Over here!\u201d</p> <p>Zane stopped on the rough wooden steps to find the origin of the voice, and then he smiled and waved. He turned to Ty and took his elbow. \u201cThey\u2019re waiting for us,\u201d he said, nodding to the door as the others disappeared inside.</p><p>Ty grunted, gesturing for Zane to lead on. It was fascinating to see Zane with people who\u2019d known him before, like watching a wildlife show\u2014prairie dogs in their natural habitat.</p><p>In short order, they arrived at a set of tables with three other couples, one of them Annie and Mark, who gave Ty a bright smile and a sardonic salute, respectively. Annie threw him off his game by introducing him as Zane\u2019s boyfriend. Word had gotten around, because no one even blinked at that. They merely shook his hand and told him their names.</p><p>\u201cOkay, who\u2019s driving?\u201d one of the women asked, raising her voice over the music. She jingled her keys in front of her.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s me.\u201d Zane doffed the bullrider and held it out over the table, waggling it.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to see any scratches on my baby, Z,\u201d Joe said in a slow drawl that seemed as stereotypically cowboy as his handlebar mustache and lanky, bow-legged frame.</p><p>\u201cYou drive a puke-green Chevy, Joe,\u201d Cody said. He was Joe\u2019s exact opposite: dark hair, dark eyes, clean-shaven, and beefy shoulders. \u201c1980 with the floorboards rusted out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the engine is cherry!\u201d Everyone laughed, and Zane waved the hat, now weighted down with other sets of keys, in front of him.</p><p>Ty\u2019s eyes were stuck on Zane, on the crow\u2019s feet that formed when he smiled and the light in his eyes. It was so rare to see him relaxed and having fun.</p><p>Keys stashed in his pockets, Zane sat down next to Ty and sprawled back in his chair as the ladies started suggesting drinks. Ty settled his hand on Zane\u2019s knee, something he\u2019d rarely been able to do in Baltimore.</p><p>\u201cHow about margaritas?\u201d one woman suggested. Jill, maybe? He hadn\u2019t quite been able to hear.</p><p>\u201cBeer,\u201d Cody said.</p><p>\u201cMojitos?\u201d That one was Marissa. Or Melissa.</p><p>\u201cBeer,\u201d Joe said, voice flat.</p><p>\u201cJack Daniels!\u201d Annie cried.</p><p>\u201cBeer,\u201d Mark insisted.</p><p>Then six sets of eyes turned on him and Zane.</p><p>Ty looked around the table with a raised eyebrow. \u201cI hear beer is good.\u201d</p><p>The guys all crowed in agreement, and Zane gave him a tolerant look of amusement. \u201cSure you don\u2019t want a peach bellini?\u201d Zane teased.</p><p>\u201cHey, those things were pretty good. And they kicked my ass.\u201d</p><p>The laughter carried around the table as Zane related the peach bellini story to the others. It was an odd feeling, being able to share experiences like that with other people. Ty was determined to enjoy it while he could.</p><p>No sooner had Zane ordered a pitcher of iced tea, than Jill jumped up and pulled on Zane\u2019s arm.</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon! No one else will line dance with me.\u201d</p><p>Ty shook his head and reached for the basket of peanuts in the center of the table. Zane could line dance all he wanted as long as they didn\u2019t drag him out there too.</p><p>\u201cAnd you ask so politely, Ms. Marshall,\u201d Zane said as he crossed his arms and shook his head.</p><p>\u201cOh come on, Garrett,\u201d Ty said over the thumping music.</p><p>\u201cShut up, Grady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou dance, I sing. Nothing to be ashamed of,\u201d Ty needled, smirking and tossing a sidelong glance at Zane.</p><p>Zane allowed Jill to pull him to his feet, but before she dragged him out to the crowded dance floor, he leaned over and poked Ty\u2019s arm. \u201cTurnabout\u2019s fair play, you know. They do karaoke every night at ten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey what?\u201d</p><p>Zane didn\u2019t answer. Ty watched him head off into the crowd, then looked at his watch. It read 9:15.</p><p>Drinks arrived a moment later, and Mark pushed the bucket of iced-down beers toward Ty. \u201cDrink up, Marine.\u201d</p><p>Cody and Joe lifted their bottles in silent toast.</p><p>Ty reached for a bottle and toasted along with them, his eyes seeking Zane out in the crowd. It didn\u2019t take but a minute of watching Zane dance\u2014the way his hips and shoulders moved, his long, lean body, his thumbs hooked into the pockets of his jeans, the smile on his handsome face\u2014to convince Ty that he couldn\u2019t watch Zane dance in public.</p><p>\u201cSo, Grady. How long you and Zane been screwing?\u201d Joe asked.</p><p>Ty almost choked on his beer.</p><p>\u201cJoe, come on!\u201d Marissa said with a wave of her beer bottle.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s got to be a better way to ask than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay,\u201d Ty said, still trying not to choke. He put the back of his hand to his mouth. \u201cJust caught me off-guard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you take a lot of shit from people?\u201d Marissa asked.</p><p>\u201cNot really. But people we work with don\u2019t know, so . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might take some shit around here,\u201d Mark told him.</p><p>Ty nodded and shrugged. \u201cI kind of expect that.\u201d</p><p>Annie looked troubled by it, but said nothing. The conversation turned toward how good Zane looked compared to the last time he\u2019d visited. Despite Ty\u2019s better judgment, his eyes strayed to Zane on the dance floor. He was the tallest man out there, easy to spot because he wore no hat. His thin western-style shirt hugged his slim torso and highlighted his impressive muscles, and his dark jeans were just tight enough to make him look even longer and taller.</p><p>He was a good-looking man, that was for damn sure.</p><p>Ty felt eyes on him and forced himself to stop staring at his lover and return his attention to the others at the table.</p><p>\u201cThis is one hell of a place,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThis is the only bar within easy driving distance of the surrounding ranches,\u201d Annie said, pointing to a prominent picture on the far wall of several men in 1970s fashion, breaking ground. \u201cThe ranch owners all went in together and built the place to keep the ranch hands from driving all the way into Austin and getting in trouble. It was Dad\u2019s idea. Now people drive from Austin just to come here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDancing, singing, drinking, whatever. They even have the trailers out back you can rent if you can\u2019t get home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just come here to drink beer,\u201d Mark announced.</p><p>\u201cYou come here to watch the blondes in the short shorts,\u201d Annie teased.</p><p>\u201cI can watch.\u201d</p><p>Laughter rippled around the table again as Annie swatted at the back of his head.</p><p>When the conversation ebbed, Ty put a hand out in front of him, as if asking them to slow down. \u201cBut I won\u2019t have to sing, right?\u201d</p><p>Annie leaned forward over the table. \u201cZ\u2019s got the keys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the tradeoff,\u201d Joe said with a sigh. \u201cZ will make you sing or dance. Believe me, I\u2019ve had to pay worse for a ride home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d pay Z more than one song for a ride,\u201d Marissa said, waggling her eyebrows and making the others laugh.</p><p>\u201cSave it for the bull,\u201d Mark advised. \u201cZ\u2019s not interested. But Ty might be able to get away without singing.\u201d</p><p>Mark smacked Ty on the back, laughing. Ty wasn\u2019t sure why it felt odd that everyone at the table knew he and Zane were a couple, but it did. He liked it, but it was still weird. Being out was definitely going to take some getting used to.</p><p>Zane begged off three songs later, claiming he was ignoring his guest, and escaped the floor by edging along the lines of dancers. He came out a quarter-turn around the room from their table, and it gave him the opportunity to watch Ty unobserved.</p><p>Ty seemed to be enjoying himself, using his unique brand of charm to fit in with the group. He held a half-empty beer bottle in his un-casted hand, but he was using both hands to gesture as he related a story the others were laughing and shaking their heads at. Zane had long ago become convinced that if Ty\u2019s hands were tied behind his back, he wouldn\u2019t be able to string together a single sentence.</p><p>Ty seemed at home in Zane\u2019s black Stetson, which he hadn\u2019t taken off since Zane had placed it on his head. It looked damn good on him.</p><p>Zane hummed and started moving again. He weaved through the tables and arrived at his chair, thumping against Ty as a gaggle of girls passing by almost knocked him into Ty\u2019s lap.</p><p>Ty reached out to help catch him with one hand, holding the beer bottle way out to the side with his broken hand so it wouldn\u2019t spill. \u201cWhoa, Lone Star,\u201d he said, laughing as he looked Zane up and down with a critical eye. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to buy me dinner before you get that far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already bought you dinner,\u201d Zane pointed out as he righted himself and sat down.</p><p>\u201cAnd he\u2019s already gotten that far!\u201d Mark added.</p><p>Ty shook his head, but he was still watching Zane from under the brim of his black hat.</p><p>\u201cYou call him Lone Star?\u201d Annie asked, snickering.</p><p>\u201cHe calls me a lot of things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to order wings. And poppers,\u201d Mark said, thumping his bottle on the table. Marissa stood and started waving her hand, trying to flag down a server.</p><p>Zane snorted and glanced at Ty. Ty was watching him with that crooked half-smile Zane loved so much. It took more willpower than Zane expected to quash the urge to sit up, lean over, and kiss him right there.</p><p>\u201cZ, you\u2019re undressing him with your eyes. Take it out back if you have to,\u201d Mark said, voice droll. Zane kicked at him under the table, and Mark kicked back a few times as they tried to get at each other.</p><p>Ty seemed content to let them rag each other without adding his own comments. He sat back and finished the bottle he\u2019d been nursing. Zane could feel his eyes on him, though.</p><p>The conversation veered into current events around the ranches, and since Zane hadn\u2019t kept up with anyone, he didn\u2019t have anything to add. It freed his attention to turn back to Ty.</p><p>\u201cSo, Grady,\u201d Zane said, keeping his voice down. \u201cThought about what you\u2019re going to sing?\u201d</p><p>Ty groaned and reached for the bucket of beers in the middle of the table. \u201cI guess I\u2019ll take requests if I really have to do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, don\u2019t do that. They\u2019ll pick something off the list of shame.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you pick one for me,\u201d Ty invited in a voice just loud enough to carry to Zane.</p><p>The thought of Ty singing something just for him was arresting. Ty didn\u2019t sing often, and when he did it was either because he was being forced to or had been drinking. Zane looked back to Ty and felt that urge again, this time with the visual of yanking Ty up out of that chair and laying him out on the table, which made all thoughts of possible song choices scatter.</p><p>He leaned forward until he was close enough to smell Ty, close enough to imagine he could taste the sweat on Ty\u2019s neck. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jesus, waiting until they got home was going to kill him.</p><p>\u201cWill you sing something for me?\u201d he asked, low and intimate.</p><p>Ty swallowed hard, and their eyes locked as Ty licked his lips. \u201cAnything you want to hear.\u201d</p> <p>Zane\u2019s heart rate ratcheted up. He set his glass down and stood. \u201cTime for a quick break,\u201d he said under his breath. He needed to cool off.</p><p>Ty nodded, frowning as Zane moved away. He excused himself from the table, and a moment later he was at Zane\u2019s side, fingers sliding around Zane\u2019s arm. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>Zane cleared his throat and managed a laugh. Having Ty so close wasn\u2019t helping him calm down enough for public consumption. He shifted his weight and met Ty\u2019s eyes. The crowded bar seemed to slow around them, fading into the background as Zane\u2019s world narrowed to the man in front of him.</p><p>\u201cZane?\u201d</p><p>Zane nodded. They didn\u2019t have to stay in public, and Zane wanted him badly. A few minutes away wouldn\u2019t be a problem. \u201cCome on.\u201d</p> <p>Ty frowned in confusion, but after a glance back at the table, he followed Zane without questioning him again. Zane headed for the back of the honky-tonk, where there were tiny bathrooms and lines a mile long. It would be quieter there away from the music, and they could talk. Or not talk.</p><p>They were in the back hallway, at the end of the line for the ladies\u2019 room, when Zane spotted a utility room door open. He stopped and turned to Ty. Ty gave him a wary look, as if he knew Zane was about to do something stupid. Zane could hardly believe he was considering this, but he figured they\u2019d done worse.</p><p>He gave Ty a grin, grabbed his wrist, and pulled him into the utility closet. Ty flailed but didn\u2019t make a sound as Zane yanked him, and as soon as the door shut, he grunted in surprise and annoyance. With their eyes not yet adjusted, it was impossible for them to see each other. Zane groped for the lock, and turned it with a muffled click.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell, man?\u201d Ty asked as he found Zane\u2019s shoulder with his fingers.</p><p>Zane chuckled, found the light switch and flipped it, illuminating a single, bare, low-wattage bulb above them. \u201cI needed a break.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the broom closet?\u201d Ty leaned against the door and met Zane\u2019s eyes, smiling and shaking his head.</p> <p>Zane moved in close, placing a palm flat on the door on each side of Ty\u2019s shoulders, caging him in. \u201cA little more private than a bathroom stall.\u201d</p><p>Ty raised his head, making his hat hit the door and slide up away from his eyes. \u201cThat kind of break,\u201d he said, a hint of playful sarcasm to his words. \u201cIt\u2019s the hat, isn\u2019t it? Just can\u2019t help yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hat just makes it worse,\u201d Zane growled. He pressed his body to Ty\u2019s, touching from chest to knee.</p><p>\u201cWant me to take it off?\u201d</p><p>Zane had had enough teasing, and he decided to shut Ty up in the only way that ever consistently worked: he leaned in to capture Ty\u2019s full lips in a voracious kiss.</p><p>Ty\u2019s arms snaked around him, fingers digging at Zane\u2019s shoulders. He hummed against the kiss, and when Zane pulled back, Ty panted, \u201cI\u2019ve been wanting you to do that all night.\u201d</p><p>Zane dragged his hands down Ty\u2019s sides. \u201cI\u2019ve been wanting to do that all night.\u201d</p><p>Ty arched, fingers gliding under Zane\u2019s belt at the small of his back. \u201cDo it again,\u201d he said with a nod of encouragement and a lopsided grin.</p> <p>\u201cBossy,\u201d Zane teased, but he did lower his head to indulge in another hard kiss.</p><p>Ty\u2019s hands found their way under his shirt, yanking at it to untuck it and slide his warm hands up Zane\u2019s back. \u201cWe\u2019ve really got to stop doing this out in public,\u201d Ty mumbled, sounding insincere as he continued to work Zane\u2019s shirt loose and drag his hands against Zane\u2019s bare skin.</p><p>Zane abandoned the thin pretext of just making out and shifted to straddle Ty\u2019s thigh. He bit at Ty\u2019s neck as he ground against him hard, thumping Ty back against the door. \u201cYou look so fucking hot tonight,\u201d he growled.</p><p>Ty laughed breathlessly. Zane could feel Ty\u2019s heart hammering, his pulse picking up. Ty\u2019s quiet, furtive breaths against Zane\u2019s skin were intoxicating and heady. Zane pulled Ty\u2019s shirt from his waistband before reaching for Ty\u2019s belt buckle, all the while licking at Ty\u2019s lips and kissing him again, hard and messy. He didn\u2019t bother to swallow the soft groans he might normally have worried about someone overhearing. The music was so loud in the bar that someone could stand right at the door to this closet and not hear a peep.</p><p>\u201cFuck, Zane,\u201d Ty gasped, sounding both exasperated and turned on. He grasped at Zane\u2019s belt, at his sides, his shoulders, anywhere he could touch. But he seemed content to let Zane have his way. And right now, Zane was of a mind to have it hard and fast.</p><p>He slid his hand under Ty\u2019s briefs to squeeze Ty\u2019s cock. \u201cI should make you get on your knees,\u201d he whispered, lips moving against Ty\u2019s ear. Ty shuddered against him, obviously liking the idea. \u201cThen again, maybe I\u2019ll just fuck you right up against this door.\u201d</p><p>Ty huffed out a breath and bit his lip against a smile. \u201cThat could probably be arranged.\u201d Lord knew they\u2019d both had a number of back-room encounters like this in their lives. Just never with each other.</p><p>Zane\u2019s reply came out a rumble as he claimed another kiss. He pushed Ty\u2019s jeans and briefs down to his thighs, groping as he went. He knew Ty was humoring him\u2014about the locale if nothing else\u2014and he planned to enjoy it to the hilt. Literally. He pulled one hand away and reached into his back pocket, where he\u2019d stashed a single-use packet of lubricant when he\u2019d changed clothes.</p><p>Ty burst out laughing when he saw it. \u201cIs that a travel pack of lube? I didn\u2019t even know they made those.\u201d</p><p>Zane grinned. \u201cWhere the hell have you been buying your lube?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been buying it, Zane.\u201d</p><p>Zane slapped Ty\u2019s hip just hard enough to sting. \u201cYou hold still,\u201d he instructed, and in one smooth motion, he went down on his knees and sucked Ty\u2019s cock between his lips.</p><p>He heard Ty\u2019s head bang against the door behind him. The hat dropped at his side, either tossed to the ground or knocked off. Ty\u2019s hand tangled in Zane\u2019s hair, and he pushed his hips forward.</p><p>The times Zane had done this, he\u2019d been slow and careful and thorough. Tonight he sucked hard and fast and messy, taking Ty in over and over.</p><p>\u201cFuck, Zane!\u201d Ty gritted out. He tugged at Zane\u2019s hair, and his hips pushed away from the door, thrusting into Zane\u2019s mouth without the care he usually took.</p><p>Zane managed to take a balancing hand off Ty long enough to tear open the lube packet and squeeze some out, and then he reached around Ty to slide the tip of his finger inside him and rub as he kept sucking. He was burning up inside; all he wanted was to hear Ty yell as he fucked him wild.</p><p>\u201cChrist, you were serious,\u201d Ty stuttered. He turned his shoulder, as if struggling to remain motionless and let Zane do what he was doing.</p><p>Zane pulled his mouth free and wrapped his fingers around Ty to pump his cock. \u201cFuck, yeah, I\u2019m serious,\u201d he growled, pushing the tip of his thumb into Ty.</p><p>Ty groaned wantonly, arching his back away from the door. Zane felt the steady beat of the music in the floor and the walls, heard the commotion of people just on the other side of the flimsy wooden door. None of it mattered. He pushed his thumb as far as it would go and shuttled it in and out as he licked around the head of Ty\u2019s cock. He focused on Ty\u2019s face, watching the pleasure there, letting it fan his own desire.</p><p>\u201cBaby,\u201d Ty gasped, closing his eyes as his hand tightened painfully in Zane\u2019s hair. His entire body was taut, just one breath away from snapping. And Zane knew that voice. If he didn\u2019t want it down his throat, he had to stop right now.</p><p>He thought twice about it, wondering what it would be like, if it would turn him on half as much as he thought it would. He\u2019d almost convinced himself to try it once or twice, chickening out at the last moment and letting Ty come on his lips or his chin instead, which had been hot enough on its own.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to risk losing his nerve again and getting come all over his shirt, though.</p><p>So he lurched to his feet and turned Ty around, thumping his chest against the door. He used the rest of the lube on himself, letting his cock push against Ty\u2019s ass as he stroked himself. He was so hard and hot, even the warm air in this little closet felt cool to him, and he wasted no time widening his stance and shoving into Ty.</p><p>Ty cried out, splayed his fingers against the door, and threw his head back, resting it on Zane\u2019s shoulder. He shouted again, almost like he was in pain, as Zane pushed past those tight muscles, then turned his head into a desperate kiss and Zane bit at his lip and shoved his cock in harder.</p><p>Zane grunted and started to thrust as their mouths bumped and slid. He could feel the scrape of his jeans on his inner thighs, taste the beer on Ty\u2019s tongue, hear women laughing outside the door. It all just heightened the sensations of fucking the hottest man in the bar in a messy back-room encounter.</p><p>Ty felt so fucking incredible against him. Zane dragged his hands up and down tight muscles and slammed Ty against the door again. Ty had to stand on his tiptoes as Zane fucked him.</p><p>Zane growled and gave himself over to the hunger, dropping any pretense of self-control. Ty was keeping up a litany of curses, and the occasional gasp tore from him with Zane\u2019s more brutal thrusts. He pushed against the door for leverage, back into Zane, grinding their bodies together and making it more violent and messy than it already was.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Zane taunted with a sharp thrust. He dug his fingers into Ty\u2019s hips, trying for any small bit of control he could get. \u201cPaint the door for me, and you\u2019ll be feeling my cum drip out of you the rest of the night.\u201d</p><p>Ty growled back, moving one hand between himself and the door. Zane could imagine what that hand was doing, and it made his groin cramp. Then Ty\u2019s head was on his shoulder again, and Ty was crying out his name as his body tightened and pulsed around Zane\u2019s cock.</p><p>Zane hunched over, grabbing Ty\u2019s ass and spreading him apart as he fucked him brutally for five or six thrusts, nailing him to the door. He let out a long moan, and his hips stuttered as he began to come.</p><p>For all the frantic violence of the coupling, his climax spun out slow and scorching, and it left him dizzy, almost staggering as it went on and on. He could feel the cum slipping out of Ty, dripping down his cock, and yet it continued.</p><p>Ty reached back and clutched Zane\u2019s hip, and Zane dragged his teeth against Ty\u2019s shoulder, still thrusting, still coming. Ty rested his head against the door, panting. Zane leaned forward and pressed his forehead to Ty\u2019s shoulder as he gasped for breath, moaning as he pulled out of his lover.</p><p>\u201cJesus fucking Christ,\u201d Ty gasped, so low that it probably wasn\u2019t meant for Zane\u2019s ears.</p><p>Zane huffed a short laugh and wrapped his arms around Ty from behind, hugging him close. \u201cLove you,\u201d he whispered against Ty\u2019s ear.</p><p>Ty laughed, nodding as his body relaxed. Zane smiled and nuzzled his cheek, kissing him. The gentle caress was a wild contrast, especially since his pulse was still thundering.</p><p>Ty turned his head, grinning as he tried to catch his breath. \u201cCertain parts of me are going to cramp if you don\u2019t let me go.\u201d</p><p>Zane grunted. He released Ty and stepped back, then glanced around the room and grabbed a roll of paper towels off a shelf.</p><p>Ty leaned against the door, watching Zane from under lowered brows and smirking. After wiping off, Zane offered Ty the roll and smirked right back.</p><p>\u201cYou know I have to ask.\u201d</p><p>Zane finished tucking himself in and zipping up. Instead of answering right away, he leaned over and picked up the Stetson, dusted it off, and placed it back on Ty\u2019s head. \u201cAsk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean . . . what the hell?\u201d Ty laughed. \u201cWhat brought this on?\u201d</p><p>Zane sighed in satisfaction, stepped close, and kissed Ty soundly. \u201cMust be the Old Spice.\u201d</p><p>Ty smiled, his gaze softening \u201cI love you too,\u201d he said. \u201cNow let me pull my pants up, huh? You can\u2019t wear a hat with your junk hanging out.\u201d</p><p>Zane laughed raucously. \u201cThey\u2019re probably wondering where we are.\u201d</p><p>Ty pulled his jeans up and buckled his belt. His eyes crossed as he looked up at the brim of the Stetson. \u201cThere\u2019s no cum on this hat, is there?\u201d he asked, deadpan.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Zane unlocked the door, then paused and gave Ty a smug look. \u201cYou look like you\u2019ve been totally fucked over.\u201d</p><p>Ty rolled his eyes and peered down at himself, fixing the buttons of his shirt and smoothing his hands over the material. Zane chuckled as he opened the door just a bit to check the hallway. And flinched in surprise. Annie was leaning against the wall opposite the closet door, arms crossed, waiting in line for the bathroom. She looked up when the door opened, and her expression swiftly morphed into an evil smile.</p><p>\u201cAw, hell,\u201d Zane muttered.</p><p>He felt Ty move, ducking behind the door.</p><p>\u201cWell, that explains your disappearance,\u201d Annie said. Her lips compressed like she was trying not to laugh. \u201cIs this what they mean when they talk about coming out of the closet?\u201d</p><p>Zane glared at her, and she gave up and laughed.</p><p>\u201cGod, she\u2019s as bad with the puns as you are,\u201d Ty said from behind the door.</p><p>Zane pulled it the rest of the way open, still glaring at her. \u201cYou\u2019re just all kinds of clever, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Ty pointed at Zane as he looked at Annie. \u201cHis fault.\u201d</p><p>Annie raised one eyebrow at Zane. All he could do was shrug. She grinned again and turned her gaze on Ty. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ty brushed past Zane, a hand on Zane\u2019s lower back as he did so. He tipped his hat to Annie and stepped out into the hall. \u201cI\u2019m too sober for this conversation,\u201d he said, and turned with the clear intention of making a quick escape. But Zane saw it coming, and caught Ty by the waistband of his jeans.</p><p>\u201cOh no, you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Ty swiped at Zane\u2019s hand, trying to free himself. Zane and Annie both laughed as Ty turned in a complete circle, grunting as he finally managed to make Zane let go of his jeans. He straightened his shirt again and squared his shoulders, as if he could salvage some dignity.</p> <p>Annie grinned as the line moved and she took a few steps away. \u201cLooks like you got out of singing for your ride.\u201d</p><p>Ty cursed under his breath, blushing even in the garish neon light.</p><p>Zane chuckled. \u201cShe\u2019s right. I think you paid for your ride, doll.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, you\u2019d probably get laid more often if you didn\u2019t call me a whore so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop your bitching,\u201d Zane said. He waved a hand toward the end of the hall. \u201cI\u2019ll buy you a fresh beer.\u201d</p> <p>Ty grumbled and made his way down the hall toward the chaotic bar room. Zane turned to follow.</p><p>Annie called out from behind him. \u201cYou gave yourself away, you know. To everyone in the bar.\u201d</p><p>Zane stopped in place and turned to stare at her. \u201cWhat? How?\u201d</p><p>Annie grinned and nodded toward Ty. \u201cHe\u2019s wearing your Stetson.\u201d</p><p>Zane had a hard time keeping his eyes off Ty, and the lingering scent of Old Spice on his clothes and skin helped to combat any urge to drink that cropped up as the night carried on. Ty made it so very easy for him to stay on the straight and narrow.</p><p>By midnight, the place had calmed. No one was dancing, and though plenty of people were still drinking and eating, it was an older crowd. Ty and Zane sat at a table, talking with the others about everything from how they had met on their first assignment to theories of what was going on at the ranch.</p> <p>\u201cI still think it\u2019s drugs,\u201d Cody said as he sipped at his last beer.</p><p>\u201cA valid theory,\u201d Ty said. \u201cWhat about rustlers? Does that even happen?\u201d</p><p>Joe nodded. \u201cIt does, but not much, and not around here. There\u2019s just nowhere to take the livestock and no way to get it there after you\u2019ve rustled it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRustled?\u201d Cody asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you say so.\u201d</p><p>Ty smiled, and Zane chuckled at them. Joe and Cody were two of Harrison\u2019s best hands. They\u2019d been around since high school, and they were the only two of the dozen ranch hands who\u2019d been invited to meet Ty who had actually come.</p><p>Annie slid back onto her stool, carrying a new bucket of beers. Marissa and Jill had called it an early night, both claiming they had to be at work in the morning. Marissa worked with Annie at her veterinary practice, and since Annie rarely saw Zane, Marissa had drawn the short end of the stick. Annie would get to call in hung over for work the next morning, while Marissa opened up.</p> <p>Ty reached for another beer as Annie told them about her practice and her tentative plans for helping the sanctuary. He opened the bottle on the edge of the table, then stuffed the cap into his pocket. \u201cSo, did you want to be a vet, or was that something you got steered toward for the benefit of the ranch?\u201d</p><p>Annie blinked. \u201cWow. You are good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTy was briefly trained as a profiler,\u201d Zane told them. \u201cI hate it.\u201d They all laughed at him.</p><p>\u201cJust a lucky guess,\u201d Ty told Annie, modest as ever when it came to his more impressive skills.</p><p>\u201cMother thought it would be good to have a veterinarian in the family. Turns out she was right, and I do love it, so . . . I didn\u2019t fight it. Not like Z did.\u201d</p><p>Ty glanced at Zane, his smile softening. He wasn\u2019t drunk, but he was just buzzed enough to be sweet and affectionate without being self-conscious. \u201cZane is a fighter.\u201d</p><p>Zane rewarded him with a fond smile.</p><p>Ty threw back the last gulp of his beer and set the empty bottle on the table in front of him. A shadow fell across their table, and Zane started at the sight of four men standing behind Ty.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Garrett, right?\u201d one of them said, voice hard and almost slurring.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>The man looked at the back of Ty\u2019s head. Ty was looking down at the table, face expressionless and shoulders relaxed. If being approached from behind was making him nervous, he wasn\u2019t showing it. But Zane knew he was looking down so he could see with his peripheral vision and be ready if anything happened.</p><p>\u201cThat makes you the queer, huh?\u201d The man reached out and poked Ty in the arm.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Annie shouted. Mark put a hand on her shoulder to calm her.</p><p>Ty remained seated, but he looked up to meet Zane\u2019s eyes. He still appeared calm, which was shocking, because Zane was roiling with anger. Thinking these men were coming at him hadn\u2019t bothered him, but to see them go at Ty was too much.</p><p>Ty lifted his broken arm, his fingers raised toward Zane in a calming gesture.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m talking to you, faggot,\u201d the man sneered as he poked Ty harder.</p><p>Ty reached for his new beer. \u201cYeah, I heard you.\u201d He took a drink and met Zane\u2019s eyes again. Zane wanted to bash the man\u2019s skull open; he had no idea why his usually short-tempered partner hadn\u2019t already done so.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just go away, Stuart? We\u2019re not looking for trouble tonight,\u201d Mark said, as unruffled as Ty. Zane attributed it to their Marine training. It wasn\u2019t easy to prod a seasoned Marine into a bar fight.</p><p>Stuart laughed, and his buddies all chuckled. \u201cWe ain\u2019t looking for trouble. We just come over here to meet the queer.\u201d</p><p>Ty stroked his chin, looking thoughtful as he gazed at the wall above Zane\u2019s head. What was he waiting for? Zane wanted to see him beat the pulp out of these assholes. He knew Ty could do it, even with one arm in a cast.</p><p>Stuart shoved Ty again, hard enough to tip him and his stool sideways. Ty managed to save his beer and avoid whacking his broken arm on anything, but the stool fell out from under him and clattered to the ground.</p><p>The noise of the bar faded as the patrons noticed what was going on. The people at the table adjacent to them got up and moved away.</p><p>Ty turned to look at Stuart, straightening to his full height. He was taller and wider than any of the four men heckling him, and they all seemed a little surprised at his size and stature. One man took a step back.</p><p>Stuart puffed out his chest and sneered at Ty. \u201cYou gonna fight me, faggot?\u201d</p><p>Ty looked him up and down, then glanced at the men behind him. He shook his head. \u201cNot until you make it a fair fight. Go get more friends. I\u2019ll wait.\u201d</p><p>People around them laughed nervously. Ty hooked his foot on the bar stool and popped it back up. Then he righted it and sat down again, putting his back to them.</p><p>\u201cHe thinks he\u2019s fucking funny. Funny ain\u2019t gonna help you here, boy.\u201d</p><p>When it didn\u2019t appear that Ty was going to do anything but ignore them and let himself be shoved around, Zane pushed his stool back and stood. Stuart and the other three turned to face him, crooked smiles on their faces.</p><p>Ty slid off his stool and stepped between them, putting a hand on Zane\u2019s chest and shaking his head. \u201cNot worth it, Zane,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cTy\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave it,\u201d Ty hissed.</p><p>Zane looked into his lover\u2019s eyes, and then at the men trying to pick a fight. He\u2019d been lured right into it: poked and prodded with words and insults until he was ready to throw the first punch in front of a saloon full of witnesses.</p><p>Ty patted his chest, waiting until he was sure Zane was calm before turning around to face Stuart and his posse. He raised both hands. \u201cYou gentlemen done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, you got somewhere to be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, we do,\u201d Annie said. She got off her stool and tugged at Mark\u2019s arm. \u201cWe\u2019re leaving.\u201d</p><p>The others moved away from the table, giving them a wide berth. But Ty and Zane were hemmed in, unable to step away unless the men moved or they went through them.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Garrett? You such a big man you got to hide behind your sissy boyfriend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait until he shows you what \u2018sissy\u2019 means in his vocabulary,\u201d Zane growled.</p><p>Ty glanced over his shoulder, silently asking Zane what they should do. They could go through these four men with little effort.</p><p>\u201cAll right, break it up over here!\u201d a man shouted as he stormed over from the bar. He was carrying a shotgun and waving his beefy hand as if shooing a pack of dogs off his lawn.</p><p>Stuart raised his hand, giving the proprietor an insolent smile. \u201cNo problems here, Bobby. We\u2019s just making friends.\u201d</p><p>They backed away, staring at Ty and Zane with smirks that made Zane want to shoot each of them in the face. It was a good thing Ty had remained calm enough for both of them, or Zane would have been on his way to a jail cell somewhere.</p><p>As soon as the door swung shut on the last man, Zane put a hand on each of Ty\u2019s shoulders and squeezed hard. \u201cThanks,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Ty nodded and looked over his shoulder, his jaw set in a hard line, his hazel eyes flashing green. He was not as calm as he had seemed when facing the other men.</p><p>Annie skirted around the table. \u201cAre y\u2019all okay?\u201d She looked just as angry as Zane felt.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Zane said through gritted teeth. \u201cIf stupidity was the worst thing we dealt with every day, we\u2019d be golden.\u201d</p><p>Ty was still staring at the doorway, jaw set. Annie put her hand on his arm. \u201cTy?\u201d</p><p>He glanced at her and nodded, then looked back at the door. \u201cWho were they? They work on a ranch close by?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, they\u2019re hands over at the Cactus Creek Ranch,\u201d Joe answered.</p><p>Ty nodded. \u201cWord usually travel that fast around here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDepends,\u201d Cody said. \u201cBig news can, but not usually. They must have been talking to someone who works on the C and G.\u201d</p><p>Ty glanced at Zane and nodded, but Zane wasn\u2019t sure what he was thinking. He put his arm around Ty instead of commenting on it. \u201cCan\u2019t believe you didn\u2019t knock him on his ass,\u201d he said as they filed out of the building into the pleasant night air.</p><p>\u201cWould have been rude,\u201d Ty said, and he sounded serious. Mark laughed, but Zane felt like he wasn\u2019t quite getting the joke.</p><p>Mark helped Annie into the cab of Zane\u2019s truck. Zane hung back with Ty, holding his hand to keep him there. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cZane, don\u2019t.\u201d Ty looked around the parking lot and then at Zane. \u201cDon\u2019t apologize for shit you have no control over.\u201d</p><p>Zane stared at him, enjoying the feeling of his racing heart and the butterflies in his stomach as he realized, all over again, just how much he loved the man in front of him.</p><p>Ty smiled. \u201cDo I get to ride in the back of the truck?\u201d he asked, a little too eager.</p><p>Zane laughed and glanced over as Cody and Joe climbed into the bed of the truck. They were making a mess of it, just drunk enough to be clumsy and not care. Joe tumbled over the edge into the bed and laughed. All they could see was one boot sticking up in the air.</p><p>Zane grinned. \u201cYeah, go ahead.\u201d</p><p>Ty gave him an impulsive kiss and headed for the tailgate. Zane pulled himself into the driver\u2019s side in time to watch Ty climb over the tailgate and plop himself down next to Cody. The man held his fist up, and Ty touched his knuckles to Cody\u2019s as he settled in.</p><p>Zane shook his head, still smiling. How in the hell did Ty worm his way into a little niche wherever he went? It was amazing. By the time they were on the road home, Zane could hear Cody and Joe teaching Ty how to perform a proper yee-haw.</p><p>Annie and Mark were laughing, and soon Zane joined them. It was a clear, free sound\u2014the kind of laugh he was only just recently remembering he could have.</p><p>\u201cZane,\u201d Annie said with a hand on his shoulder. \u201cGo find a state that allows it, and marry that man.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 7</p><p>Harrison Garrett wasn\u2019t doing any hard labor as he strolled through the barns. His body wasn\u2019t up to it yet. But he loved the smell of the barns: the hay and the leather, the horses and the wood. It brought him peace in a world that had gone crazy. Men were trying to kill him, lions and tigers lived next door, his wife was on the warpath, and his son had brought home a man he loved.</p><p>When he reached the far end of the stalls, he stumbled across Ty and Zane just outside the barn door. Ty was perched on a hitching post as he watched Zane rope the horn of a saddle set on a fence rail ten feet away.</p><p>Zane tossed the rope, landing it around the saddle horn time and time again. He was trying to teach Ty the proper technique, but Ty wasn\u2019t watching his hands or his posture, or even the rope as it sailed through the air. He was watching Zane\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cYou ready to give it a try?\u201d Zane asked, unaware that they had an audience.</p><p>\u201cNo, show me one more time.\u201d</p><p>Zane gave him a tolerant sigh and nodded. Harrison snorted, luckily not loud enough to draw their attention. This Ty Grady had Zane wrapped around his finger. It was almost sweet. And Harrison had rarely seen a man who could go toe to toe with Beverly and come out alive, much less on top and smiling. The more he saw of the man who\u2019d caught his son\u2019s heart, the more he liked him. And the more he saw of his son, the more he realized how close they\u2019d come to losing Zane altogether. Even before his wife had passed, Zane had been a cold and rather distant man. He\u2019d been so much like Beverly. Now, though, there was warmth in Zane that Harrison had never thought he\u2019d see. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It could have been a coincidence that Zane had found new life and Ty at the same time, but Harrison didn\u2019t put much stock in coincidences.</p><p>Ty was smoking a thin cigar, holding it in his left hand. He put it in his mouth and knocked on his cast in frustration. \u201cShow me one more time, then I\u2019ll try it lefty. Unless you\u2019d like to cut this off.\u201d</p><p>Zane looked him up and down and started to speak, but he stopped himself. Then he rolled his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re stalling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not stalling. I\u2019m learning.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re bullshitting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t they call it horseshitting down here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, if you\u2019re not going to try this, I\u2019ll show you how to saddle the horse instead.\u201d</p><p>Ty pointed his good hand at the doors to the barn, where Harrison stood. \u201cI\u2019m not going back in there with that horse.\u201d</p><p>Zane flopped the rope against his thigh. \u201cTy, the horses are not conspiring against you.\u201d</p> <p>Ty crossed his arms and shook his head. \u201cHe looks at me. And he talks to me! And he knows I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s saying!\u201d</p><p>Zane squinted at him. \u201cOkay. I think you\u2019ve been out in the sun a little too long.\u201d</p><p>Harrison cleared his throat, unable to keep from laughing.</p><p>Ty flinched and straightened, pushing off the hitching post. \u201cHello, sir,\u201d he said as he put out his cheroot on the denim of his jeans.</p><p>Harrison smirked. Zane had managed to go off to New York City and find someone who would have fit in on the ranch almost seamlessly. And it was obvious, even if they were trying to be subtle, that the two of them were very much in love. Harrison had never known the feeling, but he\u2019d seen it often enough to recognize it.</p><p>Zane came over, reaching out to offer an arm. \u201cDad. How are you feeling?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWinded,\u201d Harrison admitted. He took Zane\u2019s arm and leaned on him. \u201cWhat are you boys up to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cZane was showing off for me,\u201d Ty said with a smile.</p><p>\u201cI was trying to teach him how to rope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine he\u2019ll learn much, way he was staring at you.\u201d</p><p>Ty looked away, but even the hot summer sun couldn\u2019t mask the blush creeping over the man.</p><p>Harrison smiled. \u201cTake a walk with me, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Zane said as he tossed his heavy rope toward the saddle on the fence.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just, uh . . . I\u2019ll be inside.\u201d Ty jerked his thumb toward the barn door. \u201cTalking to the horse.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, you too.\u201d</p><p>Ty raised an eyebrow but moved closer. \u201cOf course, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hear you boys had a little rough-and-tumble at the bar last night.\u201d</p><p>Zane sneered. \u201cYeah, some jackass tried to pick a fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hear you two didn\u2019t entertain it. I\u2019m glad. People been talking good about you today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Zane glanced at Ty, eyebrows climbing higher.</p><p>Harrison nodded. \u201cTy, tell me something. Do your mama and daddy know about you and my son?\u201d</p><p>Ty blinked at him and looked down at his feet. \u201cYes, sir, they do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what do they think of it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell . . . they were upset that I misled them for so long. I should\u2019ve told them years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you getting at, Dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTy, here, he has impressive manners. I think I\u2019d like to meet the people who taught him. I was just trying to see if they reacted like Beverly is sure to and stormed out when you told them, or if they\u2019d want to meet me too.\u201d</p><p>Harrison reached out to take Ty\u2019s arm for some extra support. Ty\u2019s shoulders were tense, and Harrison couldn\u2019t read his expression until he gave a half-smile. \u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019d be happy to meet you.\u201d</p><p>Harrison nodded, and was about to respond when Ty stopped walking. Harrison slowed, and Zane came around to look back at Ty. The man was staring into the darkened doorway of one of the outbuildings.</p><p>\u201cTy?\u201d Zane whispered, hand going to his gun. Apparently, Zane acted on such cues from his partner a lot, treating him like a well-trained hunting dog.</p><p>Ty held out one hand. \u201cSir, may I go in there?\u201d</p><p>Harrison glanced at the shed with a raised brow and nodded. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>Ty advanced on the doorway. Inside was a stack of junk, old parts and rows of rusted tools spread around a ratty canvas tarp. The shape of the bulk beneath the tarp was barely discernible, but Harrison knew what was in there. From the looks of him, Ty Grady knew as well.</p><p>Ty edged up to the front of the tarp and put a gentle hand on it, bending until his eyes were level with the expanse of canvas. He looked back at Harrison and Zane, hazel eyes shining. \u201cDo you know what\u2019s under here?\u201d</p><p>Zane shook his head, though he appeared more interested in Ty\u2019s reaction than he had ever been in the storage sheds.</p><p>Harrison smirked. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell us what it is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m not mistaken,\u201d Ty said, a hint of anticipation in his voice, \u201cthis is an early model Mustang GT. Look at the lines and the curve of the hood there.\u201d</p><p>Harrison laughed, surprised by Ty\u2019s accuracy. \u201cLift it up, son.\u201d</p><p>Zane moved to help, and he and Ty rolled the canvas tarp back, revealing the rusted-out carcass of the old classic beneath.</p><p>Harrison watched, fascinated. The car had fallen into disrepair and had been sitting in the old shed for three decades, waiting for someone to come along and see the beauty in her. No one in the family had ever possessed the time, inclination, or skill to see her for what she was. Harrison had known; he\u2019d just never been able to raise a hand for her.</p><p>The original paint had been blasted away, leaving a dull gray primer. She had no wheels, no insignia, and no interior. The hood scoop had mice nesting in it. The grill was full of straw.</p><p>Ty fell to a knee and put both hands on the grill. \u201cShe\u2019s a \u201967 fastback, Zane,\u201d he said, his voice a reverent whisper. \u201cOh my God, she\u2019s beautiful.\u201d</p><p>Zane laughed as he looked over the old heap. \u201cIf you say so, doll.\u201d</p><p>Ty ran his hands over the body, as gentle as if he were stroking a baby\u2019s cheek. \u201cA little bit of time and effort, and she would be.\u201d He got back to his feet and disappeared into the darkness of the shed, pulling the tarp off the rest of the car.</p><p>Zane came to stand beside Harrison, smiling and shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cOh my God, she\u2019s a Shelby!\u201d Ty called from somewhere in the dark.</p><p>Zane began to laugh, smile lines streaking his handsome face. His eyes filled with joy and warmth, and his frame relaxed. Harrison hadn\u2019t seen his son like this since he\u2019d been a boy.</p><p>Harrison peered back into the darkness. \u201cTy, come on back out here,\u201d he called.</p><p>Ty edged his way out to them, looking chastised and letting his fingers slide along the car\u2019s rough exterior as he moved. \u201cSorry,\u201d he offered when he reached them. His eyes were still alight, though, and he was gazing at the car with sincere admiration.</p><p>Zane put a hand on Ty\u2019s shoulder. \u201cTy enjoys bringing old things back to life.\u201d</p><p>Harrison narrowed his eyes. \u201cTy.\u201d</p><p>Ty ripped his gaze away from the Mustang. \u201cSir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to have that car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s been sitting here for thirty years. A piece of work like that deserves someone who loves it. Someone who sees it as special even when it looks like that.\u201d</p><p>He looked from the car to his son. The expression on Zane\u2019s face was both hopeful and heartbreaking. He was holding his breath. Harrison met Ty\u2019s eyes. Ty was holding his breath too.</p><p>\u201cI can see you\u2019re a man who looks beneath the surface. And if you can do for that car what you did for my son, well . . . it\u2019ll be in good hands.\u201d Harrison glanced from him to the Mustang, and then gave Zane a sly smile. \u201cConsider her a . . . welcome-to-the-family gift.\u201d</p><p>Zane put a hand on Harrison\u2019s shoulder. \u201cDad? Really?\u201d</p><p>Harrison nodded, and Zane gave him a fierce hug, barely remembering to be careful of his injury.</p><p>\u201cThank you, sir,\u201d Ty said, clearly stunned.</p><p>Harrison held out a hand to him. \u201cYou brought my son back and turned him into a beautiful thing. I expect you\u2019ll take the same care with that ol\u2019 Hoss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d Ty choked out as he shook Harrison\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call this afternoon and arrange for delivery to Baltimore.\u201d Harrison clapped him on the shoulder, then turned and patted Zane on the chest before walking away. \u201cBreakfast is in a few minutes. Annie and Mark are riding out with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTy\u2019s skipping breakfast,\u201d Zane called back. \u201cHe\u2019s heading back to the cat place to play with his tiger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInterview the interns,\u201d Ty corrected.</p><p>\u201cHave fun with your tiger, Ty,\u201d Harrison called.</p><p>Ty\u2019s shoulders slumped. \u201cThank you, sir.\u201d</p><p>Harrison chuckled. When he looked again, Ty had Zane by the hand and was dragging him toward the old Mustang. Zane only managed to stop Ty\u2019s excited ramblings by grabbing his face and kissing him.</p><p>Harrison had never seen Zane happier or more at home than he was with Ty\u2019s arms wrapped around him. Even when he\u2019d been with Becky, he\u2019d never lit up quite like he did now.</p><p>Harrison nodded and turned away. That was enough for his peace of mind.</p><p>Ty sat on the front steps, waiting for everything to be prepared so they could ride the freaking horses out to where Harrison had been shot.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know anything about horses, and he only had one good hand, so he couldn\u2019t help much. He just sat and observed as he finished the cheroot he\u2019d been smoking before breakfast. It fended off the horse smell.</p><p>Harrison stopped outside the stable to exchange a few words with Zane, something that made Zane smile. Ty blew a ring of smoke into the air, watching it float away and enlarge to frame Zane and his father in the distance. Harrison waved a hand and headed into the barn. Zane turned and walked toward Ty. No, he sauntered. Ty loved what Texas was doing to Zane.</p><p>Zane grinned when he saw Ty watching him, but Ty sneered back. He loved Zane, but he hated horses. He hated smelling horses. He hated looking at horses. He hated riding horses. He hated falling off horses.</p><p>\u201cYou sure you don\u2019t want to just hog-tie me and drag me behind you? I might enjoy it more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, that\u2019s awfully tempting.\u201d Zane stopped in front of him, his hands in his pockets. \u201cBut I\u2019m betting either way, your ass is toast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have some sort of motorized . . . dune buggy thing?\u201d Ty asked. \u201cOr I could walk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTy, is there some past history with horses here that I don\u2019t know about? Like with motorcycles?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Ty lowered his head as a wave of embarrassment passed through him. Zane arched an eyebrow and waited. Ty shifted uncomfortably. \u201cI just . . . really don\u2019t like horses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Then I can torture you without feeling bad.\u201d</p><p>Ty crushed what was left of his cheroot on the heel of his boot. \u201cJackass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d you find out at the Sanctuary?\u201d</p><p>Ty shrugged. \u201cAll the interns were scared shitless of me. They also smelled like granola. None of them struck me as the type to be part of this. Three of them were crying by the time I was done asking questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was nice, I swear! They don\u2019t even know they\u2019re suspects; they were upset about the tigers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it screams inside job.\u201d</p><p>Ty shrugged. \u201cA volunteer, maybe? I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s not exactly Fort Knox over there.\u201d</p><p>Zane nodded and sighed. Then he smirked and looked at Ty over his sunglasses. \u201cDid you get to see your tiger?\u201d</p><p>Ty couldn\u2019t help but laugh. \u201cThey\u2019re tame, Zane. It\u2019s amazing. I mean, I wouldn\u2019t want to meet one on a dark mountaintop, but when they\u2019re in their enclosure and feel safe, they\u2019re like big kittens. Barnum even stood on his hind legs and hugged me.\u201d</p><p>Zane shook his head. \u201cI refuse to live with any more evil cats. It\u2019s him or me.\u201d</p><p>Ty made a show of thinking it over. Zane kicked dust at him and Ty laughed as he ducked away.</p><p>\u201cHow is it that you can love cats so much and hate all other forms of animal?\u201d</p><p>Ty frowned. \u201cI don\u2019t hate all other animals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHorses. Dogs. Chipmunks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re twitchy, Zane. And chipmunks have shifty eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMoths?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey have erratic flight patterns!\u201d</p><p>Zane doubled over, laughing so hard he couldn\u2019t catch his breath.</p><p>Ty glared at him. \u201cI\u2019m glad my phobias amuse you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust the fact that someone like you has a chipmunk phobia amuses me,\u201d Zane gasped.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d you find out from your dad\u2019s guys?\u201d Ty asked, raising his voice to get Zane\u2019s attention.</p><p>Zane wiped at his eyes, still chuckling. \u201cNothing. A couple of them said they\u2019d heard rumors of weird things about Cactus Creek hands, but that was it. They\u2019re pretty reticent to talk when they know I\u2019m the law.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Big Iron,\u201d Ty said with a grin.</p><p>\u201cShut up. I thought maybe you could work your magic as we ride, see if you can get anything from them.\u201d</p><p>Ty stood and stretched. \u201cI\u2019ll give it a go.\u201d He smiled slyly and added, \u201cLet\u2019s get this dog and pony show on the road then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, come on,\u201d Zane grunted. \u201cI thought you hated puns.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNot when I\u2019m the one making them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many horse jokes do you have stored up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo many.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cChrist.\u201d Zane scrubbed one hand through his hair before turning to look down the dirt road that led up to the house and barns.</p><p>\u201cYou make me ride a horse, you get unbridled puns.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s clever, I approve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Ty said. He realized Zane was distracted, though, so he shielded his eyes to look in the same direction.</p><p>Dust started billowing up the road. Zane turned his head toward the barn. \u201cDad, they\u2019re here!\u201d he yelled out as a truck drove into view, followed by two others.</p> <p>\u201cWho\u2019s what now?\u201d Ty asked.</p><p>\u201cDad told me while you were gone. He asked some of the family to go riding with us as well as some of the boys from the ranch.\u201d He shifted his weight as the trucks parked around the front yard. It was a nervous habit he showed occasionally, and it made Ty anxious too.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure. If there are problems, I\u2019ll let you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, send up a smoke signal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me one of those cigars and I will.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou want one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I do.\u201d</p><p>Ty patted his pockets like he was looking for another, then shook his head sadly. \u201cAw, I\u2019m all out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an ass,\u201d Zane whispered, though the words were uttered fondly.</p><p>Car doors opened and closed, and then several men ambled up to them, giving Zane hugs and handshakes.</p><p>\u201cThis is my partner, Ty Grady,\u201d Zane said to the group of ranch hands and family. \u201cI\u2019m not even going to try to individually introduce you; you\u2019ll have to do it yourselves.\u201d</p><p>The others gave Ty sporadic greetings. He didn\u2019t catch many of their names, but he saw Cody and Joe and nodded at them.</p><p>Ty caught wisps of the conversation as they asked Zane questions. He rubbed his fingers over his mouth, looking away so no one would notice him smiling. They were asking about research and desk work. These people had no idea who or what Zane was.</p> <p>\u201cC\u2019mon, buddy,\u201d Joe said as he broke away from the little group and came toward Ty, slinging an arm over his shoulders. \u201cLet\u2019s find us some horses.\u201d</p><p>Ty muttered as he was dragged along.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you been with Z, Ty?\u201d a ranch hand named Ronnie asked as they all walked toward the barn.</p><p>\u201cGoing on about nine or ten months now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you won\u2019t know him much, then,\u201d Ronnie said. \u201cSo we can tell you all the stories he wouldn\u2019t want you to hear.\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s head snapped around. \u201cNow, now, be nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah,\u201d a man named Jamie said, thumping Zane\u2019s right arm. Ty thought he\u2019d heard that this was Zane\u2019s only cousin. \u201cWe can share the dirt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat won\u2019t be necessary,\u201d Ty said, voice flat. \u201cMy opinion of Zane can\u2019t get much lower if he makes me ride a horse.\u201d</p><p>Zane glared at him before turning to lead the way through the barn, where several horses were saddled and ready to go.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Bout time,\u201d Harrison said. He and an older gentleman were already astride their horses.</p><p>\u201cSorry, Uncle Harrison, we were just getting reacquainted with Z,\u201d Jamie said.</p><p>Ty gave them a distraught glance. \u201cIs there anything I can do to get out of riding this animal?\u201d</p><p>Harrison rode up beside him and clapped him on the back like he thought he was joking.</p><p>Zane peered at him over the back of one of the horses. \u201cYou\u2019re the best tracker we have, Ty. We need you.\u201d</p><p>Ty grunted and looked at the horse he\u2019d be saddled with for the afternoon. It was a large bay gelding, which for Ty translated to \u201cbig-ass brown horse.\u201d The horse eyed him back. They were heading out to the site of the shooting, hoping to find some clue as to what had happened. And Zane was right, as usual. They needed a tracker.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, he\u2019s the best tracker?\u201d Ronnie asked. \u201cHe\u2019s a city boy, can\u2019t even ride a horse.\u201d</p><p>Zane shook his head, grinning. \u201cYou won\u2019t be singing that same tune in a few hours. Ty can track anything, anywhere.\u201d</p><p>Ty couldn\u2019t help but smile. The pride in Zane\u2019s voice filled him with emotions he didn\u2019t normally allow himself to linger on for fear of growing overly cocky.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t there access from the road?\u201d Ty asked in a last-ditch effort to save his ass.</p><p>\u201cThis way\u2019s cleaner on the crime scene.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDammit.\u201d</p><p>Zane chuckled.</p><p>\u201cYou sure you\u2019re not going to break that horse, Garrett?\u201d Ty asked his evil partner. They were large horses, obviously good stock, but Ty couldn\u2019t imagine anything but an elephant carrying a man of Zane\u2019s size over long distances without just snapping in two. Zane was 6\u20195\u201d, 225 pounds. Ty almost felt sorry for his horse.</p><p>Zane grinned, and his answer was pitched low. \u201cHe\u2019s a big boy, he can take it. Can you?\u201d</p><p>Ty clucked his tongue and narrowed his eyes, trying to decide if Zane was propositioning him or insulting him. Possibly both.</p><p>Annie and Mark joined them as they were checking their supplies. They formed a formidable group: ten riders, all well-armed. The others mounted around them, but Zane held back as the rest moved away from the stables.</p><p>\u201cYou okay to mount?\u201d he asked Ty.</p><p>\u201cNext time you ask me that, you better be naked.\u201d Ty gripped the pommel of the saddle with his good hand and pulled himself up in the stirrup. The animal took a few steps to the side, and Ty cussed as he held on for dear life. As soon as he was able, he pulled himself into the saddle and wrapped the reins around his palm, then slid his cast between the buttons of his shirt to keep himself from trying to use his broken hand.</p><p>He looked down at Zane and shook his head. \u201cI want you to put \u2018He didn\u2019t want to ride the damn horse\u2019 on my tombstone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoted,\u201d Zane said with a grin. \u201cYou did okay.\u201d</p><p>Ty nodded. He and his family had sometimes ridden horses along the mountain trails back home when he\u2019d been younger. He\u2019d been shitty at it then, too. He just hated them. Hated them as much as they hated him. And horses meant for mountain trails were small and hardy, easier to handle. Nothing like these monsters. These were American Quarter Horses, strong and stocky, built for working on ranches. This one was about sixty-four inches at his withers, where the neck met the back.</p><p>Ty looked down at the ground. \u201cIt\u2019s getting off the damn thing that might get interesting.\u201d</p><p>Zane patted his thigh. \u201cYou\u2019ll do fine.\u201d Then he moved to his own horse and swung fluidly into the saddle. Ty wasn\u2019t afraid to admire him. \u201cGoddamn, Zane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is Texas making you so freaking hot?\u201d</p><p>Zane laughed heartily. \u201cMust be the horse smell.\u201d</p><p>Ty grunted. Zane winked at him. \u201cHere we go\u2014the rocky expanse, salt flats, and rattlesnakes, dead ahead.\u201d</p><p>Ty urged his horse to follow Zane\u2019s. \u201cWhat could I have possibly been thinking, never visiting Texas before now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe stars at night are big and bright, deep in the heart of Texas,\u201d Zane sang.</p><p>\u201cI will knock you off that glue stick.\u201d</p><p>Zane chuckled, then sang under his breath, \u201cI\u2019ve been through the desert on a horse with no name . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cGarrett,\u201d Ty growled.</p><p>Zane smiled fondly. \u201cYou should sing for us. I can teach you a trail song.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind doing that if I were riding an ATV.\u201d Ty shifted in the saddle. It was an odd feeling, and a precarious one, not being able to guide or hold on with both hands. But he didn\u2019t trust his hurt fingers to have any strength in them. So he was forced to use his knees, which he thought was the way it was done anyway. Still, he was not liking it.</p><p>His horse sidestepped and snorted. \u201cYeah? Well, the feeling\u2019s mutual,\u201d Ty said loudly.</p><p>\u201cThe horse doesn\u2019t like you because you won\u2019t relax.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know why it doesn\u2019t like me? Because horses never like me.\u201d Ty took his hat off and set it on the horn, then pulled a red buff out of his back pocket and fixed it onto his head, arranging it like a balaclava to protect his neck and face from the elements. Then he set his hat on top of it, pulling at the brim with the tips of his sore fingers so it would shade more of his face.</p><p>He almost lost his balance before he was able to grab the horn again. The horse tossed his head, whinnying.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s laughing at me, Zane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not the only one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d Ty nodded at the riders ahead of them. \u201cYou want to catch up to them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, we should. Jamie will rag the hell out of me if he thinks I can\u2019t ride anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlame it on me,\u201d Ty offered. He clucked his tongue at the horse and urged it into a canter.</p><p>\u201cI blame everything on you.\u201d</p><p>Their horses slowed as they came alongside the others, and Harrison turned to look over his shoulder at them. \u201cYou okay back there, Ty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d Ty said, withholding the smart-ass remark he\u2019d been about to add. He grumbled and pushed his broken hand farther under his shirt as he fought the urge to use it.</p><p>Zane grinned crookedly at him.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t look too happy to be here,\u201d Cody said, leaning to catch Ty\u2019s attention.</p><p>\u201cI can think of at least ten things I\u2019d rather die doing.\u201d</p><p>Cody grinned.</p><p>\u201cYou really as good a tracker as Zane thinks?\u201d Ronnie asked from Ty\u2019s other side.</p><p>\u201cI guess we\u2019ll see.\u201d Ty loved that Zane had bragged about his skills, but he also hated it. He would much rather be underestimated. He pushed his sunglasses back up his nose. \u201cCome on, Elmer,\u201d he said to his horse. \u201cLet\u2019s find a nice prickly cactus you can toss me into.\u201d</p><p>The group rode an hour through the flats and dry hills, admiring the scenery and talking. Zane sensed an undercurrent of tension, though. Everyone had a rifle strapped to their saddle, and Zane and Ty weren\u2019t the only ones carrying knives and pistols.</p><p>When Harrison called a halt for a brief lunch, Zane was more relieved than he would\u2019ve cared to admit. It had been too long since he\u2019d ridden. He dismounted and watched Joe, Cody, and Ty bring up the rear to join them. Ty\u2019s horse was shying to the side, and Ty was cursing emphatically. For years Zane had dreaded coming to Texas so much that he\u2019d forgotten all the things he loved about it. Ty was somehow reminding him with every word of complaint and unfortunate accident.</p><p>He walked over and caught the reins on Ty\u2019s horse. \u201cYou doing okay?\u201d</p><p>Ty leaned over the horn, wincing and shaking his head.</p><p>Zane offered his hand, trying not to laugh. \u201cNeed help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKiss my ass, Garrett.\u201d</p><p>The dust wafted up around them when Ty\u2019s feet hit the ground. Even behind the sunglasses, Zane knew Ty was glaring at him. He would have given anything to be able to drag Ty behind a tree.</p><p>Instead, he slid his hand over Ty\u2019s hip and into his back pocket, pulling him closer. He had to take his hat off to steal a kiss.</p><p>Ty smiled against his lips, though when he pulled away, Ty was glaring at him over the top of his sunglasses. \u201cMy ass hurts, Garrett.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t we have this conversation when we first met?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave we had the \u2018I hate you\u2019 conversation lately? I\u2019d like to have that one again. Real soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlay nice, boys,\u201d Harrison said as he stopped by to take the reins.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not fighting,\u201d Zane said.</p><p>\u201cYes, we are,\u201d Ty sing-songed.</p><p>\u201cI swear, you two . . .\u201d Harrison pulled the soft cooler off the side of the saddle. \u201cHere you go, son. Don\u2019t want to forget your lunch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Zane said darkly, eyes on Ty. \u201cDon\u2019t want you swooning from hunger later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll show you swooning.\u201d</p><p>Harrison took the reins and led the horses away. Zane brushed against Ty\u2019s arm, pausing to whisper, \u201cMy ass hurts, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>Zane popped him in the chest with his knuckles and kept walking, cooler dangling from his hand. At least Ty seemed in decent humor. But then, Zane had noticed that Ty was often in his best moods in the face of adversity, whether physical discomfort or outright danger. He complained, sure, but often in a way that was amusing and managed to keep up the morale of others. No wonder he had thrived on a Recon team.</p><p>As Ty strolled away, the backdrop of the Hill Country offered a glimpse of Afghanistan behind a Marine. Zane\u2019s active imagination could see it, and it brought up questions he\u2019d been spending the last few months trying not to ask.</p><p>Why had Ty left the Marines? He\u2019d admitted to receiving a substantial payoff, but he hadn\u2019t offered to explain and Zane had decided it wasn\u2019t worth the fight to find out then. Every time he\u2019d thought about asking since, he\u2019d found himself thinking of Ty in his dress blues, the hint of melancholy behind his eyes when he wore them, and he let it go.</p><p>There were some sore points you just didn\u2019t poke. Ty stayed away from Zane\u2019s, and Zane gave him the same courtesy. He couldn\u2019t help feeling that Ty\u2019s secrets were darker than Ty let on.</p><p>The other guys had taken up seats on some low rocks under the shade of a copse of trees and started unpacking their lunches, and Ty wandered over to sit between Joe and Cody, making a show of being sore and stiff. Zane knew he was trying to glean more information from the ranch hands, so he let him go alone. They laughed at him as he flopped down. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He was dusty and growing more and more tanned by the minute, and he wore that hat like he\u2019d been made for it. It was enough to hold Zane\u2019s attention as Jamie, Mark, and Annie sat around him, unpacking their lunches.</p><p>\u201cHey, Z. He seems like a good guy,\u201d Jamie said.</p><p>Zane chuckled and turned to look at his cousin. \u201cHe is. But you haven\u2019t even talked to him; how would you know?\u201d</p> <p>Jamie shrugged, glancing at Ty as if he was truly considering the question.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you know about your partner, Z?\u201d Mark asked after a few moments of silent shuffling with their coolers.</p><p>Something about that question made the hair on the back of Zane\u2019s neck rise. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>Mark glanced over his shoulder at Ty and the others, then leaned closer. \u201cWhat do you know about him?\u201d he asked softly. \u201cLike, do you know anything about his past?\u201d</p><p>Zane was tempted to tell Mark how inappropriate that question was, especially when asked in front of others. But it was so odd for Mark to bring up the issue at all that Zane was curious to find out what he was getting at. \u201cWe don\u2019t talk a lot about the past,\u201d he admitted. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI knew him when he was still in service.\u201d Mark frowned. \u201cOr, I knew about him. He was a big deal where I was. Lots of respect, lots of fear.\u201d</p><p>Zane didn\u2019t doubt that, not one bit. That was true even now. People respected Ty for his abilities, and feared him because of his attitude. Zane knew he was just a big marshmallow under all the gruff sarcasm and badassery, but no one else did.</p><p>\u201cI know he was awarded the Bronze Star and a few Purple Hearts,\u201d Zane said with a hint of pride.</p><p>Mark nodded. \u201cHe was an excellent Marine, no doubt about that. But there was a lot of talk too. He seems like a nice guy, so the rumors might have been just that, but . . . stories I heard about him and his team make me worry a little, is all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMark, what the hell are you talking about?\u201d Annie asked, her voice hushed.</p><p>Mark cleared his throat and shook his head. \u201cGuess it\u2019s not the best time to discuss it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s too late for that,\u201d Zane snapped. He could feel an accusation coming, and he was already growing defensive about it.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just . . . out here with him and everyone armed like we are, I realized it was making me a little nervous,\u201d Mark admitted.</p><p>\u201cWhat is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause . . . word was, around the Corps, that your boy was crazy as hell.\u201d</p><p>Zane couldn\u2019t help it when the laugh popped out, and he had to swallow hard against more. \u201cMark, that\u2019s not news to me.\u201d</p><p>Mark didn\u2019t crack a smile, though. \u201cLike, Full Metal Jacket crazy. People said he was unbalanced, he was a hard-ass. And he was dangerous.\u201d</p> <p>Zane nodded. None of that was news to him or to anyone who worked with Ty.</p><p>\u201cAnd there at the end, folks were afraid to work with him. They said he\u2019d throw you to the wolves to save his own skin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit,\u201d Zane said.</p><p>Mark raised both hands to fend off Zane\u2019s anger. \u201cHey, I\u2019m just the messenger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s bullshit. Ty took a bullet for his last partner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Mark said with a nod.</p><p>Zane gritted his teeth. It wasn\u2019t the first time someone had warned Zane that Ty might turn on him to save his own skin. Serena Scott had said the same thing when they\u2019d worked their first case together in New York City. Despite being used as a paintball shield once during a training mission, Zane saw nothing like that in Ty\u2019s personality. If anything, he was loyal to a fault, and willing to risk himself for a stranger\u2019s safety. Why the hell did people keep telling him to watch his back around his partner?</p><p>\u201cHe tell you why he left the Corps?\u201d Mark asked.</p><p>Zane\u2019s breath caught, and he found himself looking over Mark\u2019s shoulder at Ty to see if he was paying attention to them. He wasn\u2019t. He was eating his sandwich and smiling as Joe and Cody talked with him.</p><p>Zane shook his head. \u201cNo, he never told me. Do you know why?\u201d</p><p>Mark glanced around again and slid closer to Zane, leaning in and lowering his voice. \u201cWe had our guesses. \u2019Round about when I was sent to Lejeune, Grady and his Recon boys were there, too. At that time, Marine Recon wasn\u2019t considered Special Ops. They wanted all Marines to be elite, you see? So they didn\u2019t class any of them as different. But Recon was missing out on the special assignments.\u201d</p><p>They were all leaning in, giving their little group a conspiratorial look. Zane was hyper-aware of the others, praying Ty wouldn\u2019t take notice of them. He hated that he was listening to gossip about Ty\u2019s past, but he just couldn\u2019t seem to pass up the opportunity to learn something without having to ask Ty again.</p><p>Mark paused to take a drink as Zane\u2019s stomach churned with nerves.</p><p>\u201cSo around then, the Corps put Recon into the Special Ops ring. A few months after I got there, Grady\u2019s group came home from a float. Two of them were real beat up. I mean beat all to hell. Grady was one of them.\u201d</p><p>Zane swallowed hard. This must have been right after Ty and Nick O\u2019Flaherty had been captured and tortured. He felt ill as he imagined the shape the two of them must have been in when they\u2019d returned home.</p><p>\u201cThe story was they\u2019d got into some sort of brawl in Spain and spent time in jail, but bar brawls don\u2019t cause the damage I saw, and neither does a Spanish prison. There were rumors they\u2019d actually been taken prisoner on a black ops mission and escaped. Now that, I believed. I remember running into Grady in the mess hall one night after he got back. He was ahead of me in line. He had this . . . vacant look, like he was lost in his own head. Wouldn\u2019t meet anyone\u2019s eyes, just looked right through them. Marines call it the thousand-yard stare. I remember it being pretty eerie to look at him. Lot of guys avoided him and his buddies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why Ty was discharged?\u201d Jamie asked, frowning. \u201cBattle trauma?\u201d</p><p>Mark shook his head. \u201cHe and his buddy both recovered pretty fast. But one of the other men in Grady\u2019s secondary group, he went . . . he was stark raving mad. I mean real, certifiable crazy.\u201d</p><p>Zane raised an eyebrow at that, but it didn\u2019t surprise him. From what he knew of Ty, all Recon boys were certifiable to varying degrees. \u201cThat\u2019s . . . kind of sad. But what does that have to do with Ty?\u201d</p><p>Mark shook his head. \u201cThis guy started causing problems, on base and off. Word was a couple of them caught him trying to rape some girl in town, stopped him, and dragged him back to the brig before he could. Guys that saw him said he was beaten to a damn pulp. Rumor was Ty had done it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d Annie said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but what does that have to do with him being dangerous? He caught someone trying to rape a girl and beat him up. Good for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But the Brass didn\u2019t want it getting around that Recon assignments were literally driving Marines nuts, so they had to sweep it under the rug. Word around the camp was they called Grady and this other guy\u2014Sanchez, I think?\u2014in for a talk. A week later, twelve of them went out on a training mission. Eleven came back.\u201d</p><p>For some reason, the implication went right over Zane\u2019s head at first. But when he reviewed what Mark said, he couldn\u2019t keep from frowning. Was he actually accusing Ty and his Recon group of murder?</p><p>\u201cThey said he jumped off a cliff,\u201d Mark said with a snort. \u201cI was transferred shortly after that, so I never heard what happened. But Ty said the Marines didn\u2019t want him anymore. I have to wonder if that was why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your point, Mark?\u201d Zane asked. The upset was roiling in his gut again, but he wasn\u2019t sure why he was angry. Perhaps it was because he couldn\u2019t say with conviction that Ty would never do that. In fact, Zane knew that if Ty perceived someone as a threat to him or something he loved, he\u2019d definitely push that person off a cliff.</p><p>\u201cMy point is . . . he might have violent tendencies. And he follows orders above all else. You should know, and I think you should be careful,\u201d Mark said, looking as if he hated the fact that he was saying it. \u201cYou know. Wary of his . . . mental state.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d Annie grumbled. She went back to her sandwich. \u201cPeople at Lejeune also said Blackbeard haunted the rescue helicopter.\u201d</p><p>Mark shrugged. \u201cI just . . . I wouldn\u2019t want Z getting hurt.\u201d He glanced over his shoulder to look at Ty one last time.</p><p>It hit Zane hard. Mark was unnerved by Ty\u2014a fellow Marine\u2014and he was concerned for Zane\u2019s safety. Ty had saved Zane\u2019s life many times over, in many different ways, and yet Mark was concerned for Zane\u2019s safety. The harsh dichotomy almost made Zane sick. It wasn\u2019t fair that people looked at Ty like that, not after all he\u2019d been through and all he\u2019d sacrificed.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he managed to get out, though the words tried to stick in his throat. \u201cConsider me warned.\u201d</p><p>Mark nodded, then took another long drink of his water. All three of them sat watching Zane.</p><p>\u201cI gotta admit, I was expecting more of a reaction,\u201d Mark said.</p><p>Zane stared at him, unmoving even when Mark shifted uncomfortably. Finally, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t know. I know what Ty\u2019s capable of, and I know he battles a few demons. Hell, we\u2019ve even exchanged a few blows in the past. But I also know he loves me and I love him, and I think he\u2019d die before he'd hurt me. So I guess I\u2019ll take my chances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough,\u201d Mark said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve missed you, Z,\u201d Jamie said instead of commenting on it. \u201cWe\u2019re glad you\u2019re here. And most of us are glad to meet Ty, too.\u201d</p><p>Zane considered him for a long moment. \u201cI need to stay in touch better.\u201d</p><p>Jamie grinned. \u201cAbsolutely. Even if your boyfriend is nuttier than squirrel shit.\u201d Then he looked across the grass to where the other guys were sprawled. \u201cSo, you love him?\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s lips quirked. \u201cYes. I love him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen he\u2019s a good guy,\u201d Jamie said with a glance at Mark. \u201cI can\u2019t see you loving someone who\u2019s not a good person.\u201d</p><p>Zane almost choked on his sandwich. He turned an incredulous glance on his cousin.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d Jamie said, gesturing toward Ty and the others. Mark rolled his eyes and started massaging the bridge of his nose.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s also really hot,\u201d Annie added.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Mark grumbled.</p><p>\u201cHot is hot, baby.\u201d</p><p>Zane laughed, and the uncertainty that had settled on his shoulders began to dissipate as his gaze shifted to Ty. His partner was leaning against a rock, eating and talking with the men around him. Cody and Joe had immediately taken a liking to Ty, and Ty to them. Zane smiled.</p><p>Annie whistled and Jamie broke out in a laugh. \u201cHe\u2019s that good, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God for small favors.\u201d</p><p>The conversation turned to the past, Zane reminiscing about their childhood adventures with his sister and cousin. Soon Harrison was moving them back toward the horses.</p><p>Zane met Ty at his horse. \u201cLearn anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCody and Marissa are having a thing. What were y\u2019all talking about over there?\u201d</p><p>Zane licked his lips and shrugged. \u201cMark thinks you\u2019re crazy and dangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Ty said evenly, though his eyes gleamed with amusement. \u201cHe tell you about the time we killed one of our teammates by shoving him off a cliff?\u201d</p><p>Zane blinked and nodded.</p><p>Ty laughed as he slid his sunglasses back on. \u201cYeah, good times.\u201d He put one foot in the stirrup. The horse took a step, causing him to hop with it to keep from falling down. Then it took another, playing with him. \u201cHold on now, Elmer,\u201d Ty growled as he pulled himself into the saddle.</p><p>Zane put a hand on Ty\u2019s thigh and peered up at him. \u201cIs it true?\u201d</p><p>Ty stared at him for a moment, his expression hidden behind his sunglasses and the shade of his hat. He finally gave a curt nod. \u201cHe fell off a cliff, that\u2019s for sure. But the only thing that pushed him was the ghost of Blackbeard.\u201d</p><p>Zane shook his head, smiling. \u201cI love you. Even if you are a crazy, cold-blooded murderer of your coworkers.\u201d</p><p>Ty grinned and reached down to run his fingers through Zane\u2019s hair. As soon as he let go of the reins, the horse danced sideways, taking Ty with him. Zane laughed as Ty cursed the horse and his lineage, trying to regain control.</p><p>He was still laughing as he headed for his own mount, investigating the feelings of the last half hour. Even if what Mark had said about Ty was true, Zane didn\u2019t care. That in itself was kind of scary.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Elmer. Let\u2019s go find a glue factory,\u201d Ty said to his horse, who tossed its head and snorted as if in argument. \u201cUh-huh, you know why? Opposable thumbs, bitch!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMan\u2019s crazy,\u201d Zane\u2019s uncle said to Harrison.</p><p>Zane grinned.</p><p>Harrison nodded and they watched Ty argue with the horse. \u201cSeems to work for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m up here, and you\u2019re the one wearing the saddle,\u201d Ty told his horse as they headed off.</p><p>When they reached the pump house, Ty dismounted with a grateful groan, then cursed the animal up and down. The guys surrounding him cackled as they swung down with no problems.</p><p>Zane was still chuckling as he joined Ty, though they were both moving stiffly. Zane put an arm around his shoulders and squeezed. Ty was still getting used to being able to do it without fear of being seen. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The pump house was simply an old adobe and wood shack, patched and patched again over the years, there to mark the ancient spring well and to show tour groups that came through.</p><p>Harrison took them through the events of the morning he\u2019d been shot. It had been just past dawn and he\u2019d been riding, as he said, to check the problem area at the problem time.</p><p>He\u2019d seen a vehicle parked beside the pump house and gone closer to investigate. They weren\u2019t far from a main road, and since he suspected most of the trespassing was just kids messing around, he\u2019d assumed someone had been off-roading and gotten stuck, broken down, or possibly even hit the old building and been hurt.</p><p>When he\u2019d gotten closer, however, he\u2019d seen that the truck was idling, a large tarp covering the back roll bars. And then the driver had fired at him.</p> <p>He\u2019d been lucky to get away with just the one bullet hole in him, and he\u2019d lashed himself to his saddle before passing out from loss of blood. The horse had carried him home.</p><p>Ty was unspeakably impressed with Zane\u2019s father. Now he knew where Zane got it from.</p><p>By the time anyone had come back out here, whoever had done it was long gone. The place had since been trampled with police vehicles, horses, and footprints. Ty surveyed the scene, shaking his head. It was daunting. Now he really wished Zane hadn\u2019t bragged about his tracking skills.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Zane asked, voice low. \u201cThink you can unearth anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Zane. I mean . . . it\u2019s been baking in the sun for two weeks. The scene\u2019s been disturbed by all kinds of things. I\u2019m not sure I could recreate what happened, even knowing how it went down from your dad\u2019s statement.\u201d</p> <p>Zane caught his hand and ducked his head so Ty would meet his eyes. \u201cWill you try? Please.\u201d</p><p>Ty stared at him, held captive. Zane so rarely busted out the cartoon bunny eyes, it worked on Ty every time he did it. Damn him.</p><p>\u201cOf course, Zane,\u201d he whispered. He squeezed Zane\u2019s hand. \u201cJust . . . don\u2019t get your hopes up, okay?\u201d</p><p>Zane nodded, looking pleased as he let go of Ty\u2019s hand.</p><p>Ty huffed at him. He headed for the pump house first, taking his time as the sun beat down on his shoulders and waves of heat shimmered in the distance. He shed his shirt, leaving the paper-thin Henley underneath to protect him from the sun.</p><p>It took him nearly half an hour to traverse the entire scene. He was aware of the others getting restless, spreading out, finding shade, grumbling, napping. He pushed all that away, trying to focus on the tidbits of evidence he could find in the sand and shrubs.</p> <p>Finally, the others lost patience with him.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the news, Grady?\u201d Joe called out.</p><p>Ty winced and wiped at the back of his neck with the buff he wore. \u201cA car was parked here, by the pump house. It had been here for a few hours.\u201d He bent with a plastic bag in his hand and picked up a husk of a cigarette with it. There were several nearby, telling the tale of someone waiting there. \u201cIt was a four-wheel drive vehicle, a truck or possibly an SUV.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, thanks Sherlock, we know that from what Harry said,\u201d Ronnie grumbled.</p><p>Ty nodded, unperturbed. \u201cThere were three men, and after they parked, two headed that way, toward the perimeter fence.\u201d He pointed toward the large, artfully camouflaged fence that abutted the Carter Garrett Ranch and the Roaring Springs Sanctuary.</p><p>Everyone in the group squinted off into the distance. The fence was about two miles away, across rolling hills and deceptive flats. No wonder the shooters had parked so far away if their goal was the sanctuary; the land wasn\u2019t passable by vehicle from here.</p><p>\u201cWhen they returned, there were five of them. That\u2019s six perps total. They were carrying something heavy, and they made two trips.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d Annie asked, sounding impressed.</p> <p>\u201cTheir footprints are deeper on the return,\u201d Ty answered. He held up a different plastic bag that contained a shell he\u2019d found in the rubble next to the adobe pump house. \u201cThey scrambled when they saw Harrison, fired from a .44. You\u2019re lucky, sir, that they had rifles and not small arms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cImpressive,\u201d Harrison said with a nod.</p><p>Ty turned where he stood and cocked his head at the fence in the distance. \u201cThat\u2019s a long-ass way to drag a drugged tiger.\u201d</p><p>Zane came up to stand beside him, placed a hand on his shoulder and squeezed. It was basically a \u201cgood boy\u201d pat on the head. Ty bit his lip to keep from grinning like an idiot.</p><p>\u201cMaybe they thought there was security?\u201d Zane suggested. \u201cThey parked next to the only structure in the area, on the side that would hide them from the preserve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything points to an inside job, so they wouldn\u2019t be worried about security. They parked here because they couldn\u2019t get their truck any closer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd they returned with more men than they went in with? You\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m betting someone went in through the front, bypassed the security, nabbed a key since none of them were missing, and just waltzed on out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d hate to carry a tiger in a cage over two miles across this terrain,\u201d Zane said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d hate to carry a tiger at all.\u201d</p><p>Zane hummed and narrowed his eyes, then glanced around at the others. Harrison was scratching his head. \u201cDad, is it possible what you saw under those tarps was animal cages?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey could have been alien spaceships for all the look I got at them.\u201d Harrison rubbed at his arm, obviously sore.</p><p>Ty glanced up at the sky. They had many hours of daylight left. \u201cYou should send your dad home,\u201d he whispered to Zane.</p><p>\u201cGood luck with that,\u201d Zane said, then turned away and headed back to the group.</p><p>Ty watched him walk away, then returned his attention to the ground. He continued to look around the old pump house, scanning the area for anything he might have missed. The boot treads were all worn to nothing, no way to tell shoe sizes or height and weight, nothing but their numbers.</p><p>He stepped up to the crumbling doorway of the pump house and peered in, not sure if the structure was sound. Shafts of light filtered through the broken roof. The walls were so thin in places that he could see shadows moving through them. The interior was empty, save for a few faded beer cans and trapped tumbleweeds. He shook his head. This was no drug runners\u2019 stronghold.</p><p>He knelt and plucked a stone from the ground, and was arrested by how cool it was. He placed his palm on the ground in the shadow of the building.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d someone asked from behind him.</p><p>Ty looked over his shoulder to find Mark standing there. He hesitated, paying more attention to the feeling of unease settling in his gut. Something wasn\u2019t right, but he couldn\u2019t decide why.</p><p>Jamie and Zane joined them, both frowning down at Ty.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Zane asked.</p><p>Ty looked from Zane to the others and stood, holding up the rock and trying to put a smirk on his face. \u201cSouvenir,\u201d he said as he slid the rock into his pocket and stepped away.</p><p>Jamie and Mark shared a glance, then both shrugged. Zane, however, hadn\u2019t been fooled. His eyes followed Ty.</p><p>Annie\u2019s cell phone began to ring as they returned to their horses, the sound out of place in the middle of nowhere. She fumbled in her saddlebag for it, finding it and answering with a professional greeting.</p><p>Her face immediately lost its composure. \u201cWhat?\u201d she exclaimed, looking at Mark and then Zane with wide eyes. \u201cWhen? Okay, we\u2019re out in the hills right now. No, I promise you, my brother will do everything he can. Hello? You there?\u201d She pulled the phone away and looked at it.</p><p>They were all waiting as she put the phone away.</p><p>\u201cMy stupid battery died!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho was it?\u201d Zane asked in exasperation.</p><p>\u201cIt was Tish. From the preserve. She said two more of their tigers are missing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Ty asked, his heart sinking. \u201cIs it Barnum and Bailey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, how\u2019d you know?\u201d</p><p>Ty swallowed hard. \u201cTheir enclosure was the next closest to the perimeter. Easiest targets.\u201d</p><p>Zane looked from Annie to Ty. \u201cMeans someone\u2019s got your tiger, Ty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoddammit!\u201d Ty spat.</p><p>Harrison turned his horse. \u201cOkay,\u201d he said. He looked at Zane\u2019s uncle, who Ty had decided must have been Beverly\u2019s brother and not Harrison\u2019s, since everyone talked about Zane being the last Garrett around. \u201cStan, you go with a few of them and head back for the house. I want you to stay there until you hear from us.\u201d He glanced at Joe and Cody. \u201cGot it? These people find out we\u2019re after them, I want the house covered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d the men said in unison.</p><p>Stan was nodding, gathering the reins to his horse. \u201cWe\u2019ll lock her up tight. Alert the authorities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnnie, you go with them,\u201d Harrison added.</p><p>Annie put her hand on the black bag that was strapped behind her on the saddle. \u201cNo, I\u2019m coming with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnnie,\u201d Mark started, but she cut him off.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the only one with medical training here. And you might need me if the tigers are out there and you\u2019re able to retrieve them.\u201d</p><p>No one seemed to like it, but they couldn\u2019t argue with that logic. Ty chuckled. \u201cNext thing you know, you women folk will be wanting to vote and everything,\u201d he joked as he pulled himself into his saddle.</p><p>Annie tossed a bandana at him, which he caught and waved like a prize. He winked at her as the others parted from them, heading back to the ranch as they\u2019d been ordered.</p><p>\u201cDid the woman from the cat place say when Barnum and Bailey went missing?\u201d Ty asked as her horse drifted closer to his. He handed her the bandana.</p><p>Annie shook her head, grunting a thank-you as she stuffed the bandana into her pocket. \u201cShe said they found them gone when they went to feed them.\u201d</p><p>Zane exhaled noisily. \u201cIf we assume they did it the same time as the last job, that means we\u2019re as much as six hours behind them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see if we can find where they entered. It\u2019s got to be close,\u201d Mark said.</p><p>They headed off toward the fence, weaving through narrow gullies and over odd-shaped hills. Ty was surprised at how distracted he was at the thought of Barnum and Bailey in danger.</p><p>\u201cWhat do they do with these tigers, do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t hurt them, not on purpose,\u201d Annie assured him. \u201cThey\u2019re either breeding them or selling them as commodities. A live and healthy tiger is far more valuable than a dead or injured one.\u201d</p><p>Ty let out a relieved breath. He\u2019d grown attached to Barnum. Something about the way the tiger looked at him with those golden eyes, one ear flopped to the side. He\u2019d felt an instant connection to the animal. When he\u2019d gone back to visit, he\u2019d seen more of the tiger\u2019s personality and he\u2019d been hooked. Now that Barnum might be in danger, it felt personal.</p><p>\u201cYou lurve the tiger,\u201d Zane crooned.</p><p>\u201cShut up, Zane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh come on, admit it. You\u2019re a big bad tough guy who fell in love with an itty bitty kitty.\u201d</p><p>Ty barked a laugh, then tried to glare at Zane and failed. \u201cAre you done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot nearly,\u201d Zane practically giggled. \u201cYou just like things that can maul and maim you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExplains my affinity for you, Hoss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeow Mix.\u201d</p><p>Ty rolled his eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you call him that?\u201d Harrison asked.</p><p>\u201cWhen we went hiking last October, he was attacked by a mountain lion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d Jamie asked, voice going higher.</p><p>Ty raised his left hand to show the scars.</p><p>\u201cHe has a paw print on each shoulder too,\u201d Zane told them, sounding almost proud of the fact.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re both wrong in the head.\u201d</p><p>Ty remained quiet as they came upon the fence that ran along the perimeter of the sanctuary. Zane could tell his partner was pissed off and worried, and it struck him as sweet that a man like Ty was concerned over the welfare of a pair of tigers. He also knew whatever Ty had found at the pump house, he\u2019d kept to himself. It worried him\u2014not that Ty was keeping secrets, but why. He knew better than to ask about it now. It would have to wait until they were alone.</p><p>They dismounted, leaving the horses with Annie a few dozen yards away, and spread out, trying to find a sign on the ground or a path through the fence. Zane wasn\u2019t exactly a master tracker, but he could find footprints in sand, and that was what they were seeing.</p><p>It took them roughly ten minutes, but Harrison stumbled over the entrance, links of the chain fence and the shrubbery that grew along it all cut by a bolt cutter so it would open and close like a door. When they\u2019d visited the sanctuary the day before, Tish had told them that no one had checked the perimeter fences from inside yet. But Zane wasn\u2019t sure they would have seen the opening even if they had. It was only obvious because of the tracks leading to it.</p><p>They gathered around Harrison as Annie kept the horses back, trying to preserve the tracks on the ground. The fence had been cut almost seven feet off the ground, and when Ty sliced off a piece of cactus and tossed it at the fence, no current was running through it.</p><p>\u201cMeans an inside job again, don\u2019t you think?\u201d Zane whispered.</p><p>Ty was nodding. \u201cSomeone killed the security measures to make it safe to cut the fence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s someone working at the preserve, why not just open the front door and cart the tigers out that way?\u201d Mark asked.</p><p>Zane shrugged. That was a good question. \u201cCould be someone with limited access. Could be a convoluted way to cover their tracks. Hell, it might even have been easier to go this way. All those hills and trails inside? We need to look closer at their security to know for sure.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s safe to call in the local LEOs now, though,\u201d Ty said.</p><p>\u201cThe local what?\u201d Jamie asked.</p><p>\u201cLEO. It\u2019s short for law enforcement officer,\u201d Mark answered.</p> <p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>Zane nodded again. They had enough evidence of a crime to bring in the local authorities. Which meant Ty and Zane could head home soon. The thought excited Zane, but it also made him sad. This was the first visit home he\u2019d truly enjoyed since he\u2019d left for college. Ty and the truth were both powerful sources of happiness.</p><p>He glanced at Ty as his lover paced back and forth, head down, body tense, like a prize hound on a scent. Zane grinned. He wondered if Ty would be open to coming back here regularly.</p><p>They continued to snoop around, trying to glean more information before they called it in. Ty told them what he was seeing: evidence of three men going in, and six coming out, carrying a heavy load. There were small tire tracks this time, like a hand truck or cart had been used. And they were fresh, less than an hour old.</p><p>Ty bent and examined something on the ground, and when Zane came closer, he saw that Ty was holding a tranquilizer dart.</p> <p>Annie shouted from where she was keeping the horses at bay. \u201cIt\u2019s probably a mixture of azaperone and sufentanil. Or maybe carfentanil. A combination of dopamine antagonist and analgesic that would be appropriate for such large animals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d she say?\u201d Ty asked.</p><p>\u201cShe said don\u2019t stick yourself with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>Annie drew closer to look at the dart. She left the horses, their reins draped over scrub brush to keep them from wandering. \u201cWhen the dart hits, there\u2019s a steel ball that pushes forward and injects the medication. It\u2019s collared to keep it from falling out. The barbs on that dart haven\u2019t been replaced properly, meaning it was either yanked out or it fell out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would that happen?\u201d Zane asked. Ty twirled the dart between his thumb and forefinger.</p> <p>\u201cThey could have hit bone with it instead of muscle. That means that the animal they were trying to sedate didn\u2019t get nearly enough of the medication to be out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope he eats them,\u201d Ty growled.</p><p>Zane patted his partner\u2019s shoulder, torn between amusement at Ty\u2019s vehemence and worry for the animals.</p><p>Ty got up and began wandering north along the fence, away from the tracks.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got tire tracks, clear as day. I say we follow them,\u201d Mark called out as he examined the tracks that led south, toward the nearest roads. The poachers had obviously found a more direct path to the fence this time.</p><p>Zane nodded. He headed over to peer down at the tracks. They were so clear that even he could have followed them. They\u2019d had a rare summer rain several days ago, making the earth just moist enough to retain the heavy impressions. He glanced up, seeking either his father or Ty for their opinions. Harrison was nodding, but Ty had wandered away from them. Annie had managed to wrangle in the other horses, but Ty\u2019s horse was following behind him, unbeknownst to Ty, of course, or he would have been throwing a shit fit about it obscuring evidence.</p><p>Zane almost laughed as he watched the animal plod along. What was it that made Ty a target for such undying loyalty? He seemed to inspire it in everyone he dealt with, including animals he hated.</p><p>Ty was studying the ground, good hand at his mouth, the casted one stuffed into his pocket.</p> <p>\u201cTy!\u201d Zane called out.</p><p>Ty glanced up and turned, saw the horse standing right there behind him, and stumbled back with a surprised shout. He almost tripped over a cactus behind him, but he caught himself and bent over, holding his hand to his chest.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do that!\u201d he yelled at the horse. The animal whinnied happily and butted its nose against his shoulder.</p><p>The rest of them laughed, not even trying to spare Ty\u2019s pride.</p><p>When Ty finally pushed the horse\u2019s head away, he looked over at Zane, but then returned his attention to the ground. \u201cI think I have cat tracks here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTiger tracks?\u201d Annie asked.</p><p>\u201cIt sure as hell ain\u2019t Tom and Jerry.\u201d Ty knelt to touch the dust near his feet. \u201cI\u2019ve never tracked a tiger before, but this is definitely feline and not canine. Can somebody come get this stupid horse!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe thinking one of the tigers got away?\u201d Harrison asked, clearly concerned. He had thousands of acres of horses, sheep, cattle, and other livestock out here, not to mention the daily busloads of greenhorns who came to ride the trails. The last thing they wanted was a large predator on the loose.</p><p>\u201cHe definitely got away. These are running strides.\u201d</p><p>Zane smiled as he watched his partner. The confidence with which he could say that was indescribably sexy, and Zane wasn\u2019t ashamed to admit that he was proud of Ty.</p><p>Ty\u2019s aviators glinted in the sunlight, and his jeans and thin white Henley were soaked through with dirt and sweat. Zane wanted to tackle him to the ground and lick him all over.</p><p>\u201cI think we follow the truck,\u201d Mark said. \u201cFinding the tiger doesn\u2019t get us any closer to catching these guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed,\u201d Ty said immediately. Zane looked over in surprise. \u201cBut if the tiger\u2019s hurt he won\u2019t last long. There\u2019s also the possibility he\u2019ll be attracted to the main house and barns. To the livestock, or even one of your trail rides.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTy\u2019s right. We at least need to notify the authorities, let them know there may be an exotic on the loose,\u201d Harrison said.</p><p>\u201cI think we should follow the tiger,\u201d Annie said, tossing a pleading look at Zane and Mark. \u201cHe might be hurt. You know he\u2019s scared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnnie. Honey. He\u2019s a tiger. He\u2019s top of the food chain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could split up,\u201d Jamie suggested. \u201cWe\u2019ll follow the tire tracks and see where it\u2019s getting access to the property. Ty and Zane can track the tiger, and Annie can head back to the house and alert the animal control people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr hell, walk into the preserve and use their phone,\u201d Zane said with a wave at the fence.</p><p>\u201cNo, no one goes anywhere alone right now. That tiger can take down a horse and rider, sure as the world,\u201d Harrison said. \u201cDamn, I should have kept the boys with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it was the right call to send them back to the house,\u201d Ty assured him.</p><p>Harrison nodded, frowning. He glanced at Zane. \u201cI\u2019m sure the sanctuary people called the authorities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut they won\u2019t know the tiger is loose, and \u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cZane,\u201d Harrison said in a voice that stopped Zane dead in his verbal tracks. \u201cWe need a badge to follow after that truck, just in case they\u2019re still around and we actually catch up to them. And Ty\u2019s the only one can track that cat. He needs a vet if he\u2019s going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait a minute,\u201d Mark said, voice going higher. \u201cYou want Ty and Annie to go after that tiger alone?\u201d</p><p>Harrison nodded. His gnarled fingers rolled a cigarette as he spoke.</p><p>\u201cSir!\u201d</p><p>Harrison shot a look at his son-in-law that immediately silenced him.</p><p>\u201cI have the tranquilizer darts,\u201d Annie said with a hopeful look at Ty.</p><p>Ty shrugged. He took his hat off and ran his hand through his hair before replacing it. Zane found himself staring again. He met Ty\u2019s eyes, wincing as the sun flashed off his sunglasses.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like it, but it makes the most sense,\u201d Ty said.</p><p>They laid down a few more logistics, then separated. Zane sat high in his saddle and watched as Ty led his horse away on foot, picking up the trail of the lost tiger. He mounted a few moments later, Annie following a few feet behind him.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll take care of her, right?\u201d Mark asked, eyes on Annie.</p><p>Zane nodded. \u201cWith his life.\u201d</p><p>Ty estimated they rode for roughly three miles before the tiger tracks started to get too faint to see from horseback. He dismounted and continued to follow the trail for another half a mile before he lost it completely.</p><p>Annie sat and watched him pace back and forth. He was going grid by grid, trying to pick the trail up again. While he performed the methodical search, Annie told him what she knew about tigers. Like many other predators, he\u2019d studied them back when he\u2019d been trying to learn everything there was to know about how to kill, but he listened anyway, recognizing her rambling knowledge dump as a sign of her nerves.</p><p>She told him that a tiger could hit a top speed of thirty-five miles per hour, but could only maintain it in short bursts. If the tiger caught the drop on them, it would take down a horse before they could outrun it. If they were alert, though, and stayed away from areas of easy ambush, the horses would be able to outrun and outdistance the big cat.</p><p>The problem with that was that out here, almost everywhere was an easy ambush for a tiger.</p><p>Ty found himself glancing around every few seconds. The fact that they usually hunted at night didn\u2019t comfort him much, nor did the fact that Barnum and Bailey were tame and used to humans. A life in the circus being petted by kids didn\u2019t mean they weren\u2019t still tigers with the survival instincts of wild animals. He wasn\u2019t fooling himself into thinking they weren\u2019t in danger.</p><p>\u201cHave you lost him?\u201d Annie asked after a few minutes.</p><p>\u201cI think so, yeah,\u201d Ty admitted. They were atop one of the odd, knobby hills that peppered the land, sun-baked and windswept. It was nearly impossible to find a sign. Hopefully, he\u2019d pick up the trail again on the descent, but he had to find the route the tiger had taken in order to do that.</p><p>The sun beat down, searing through Ty\u2019s shirt and reminding him of the many days he\u2019d spent on Recon missions, wishing he were in a pool.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s impressive, what you\u2019re doing,\u201d Annie said.</p><p>Ty shrugged and continued his careful search. \u201cMy dad taught me to track in the mountains. It\u2019s easier there\u2014lots of underbrush to hold sign, and the ground is usually moist enough to retain a track. I picked up more in the military, learned new terrain. The desert is tricky. Hard-packed dirt is near impossible sometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I wasn\u2019t talking about the tracking. Although I am impressed,\u201d Annie added, a smile in her voice.</p><p>Ty peered at her, raising a hand to shield his eyes from the sun.</p><p>\u201cThe last time I saw my brother, he was . . . not my brother. Broken. Drinking and torn apart and hopeless. No one could reach him. His eyes were dead and I just knew he would be too, soon. But here he is.\u201d</p><p>Ty smiled, but he shook his head. \u201cWhat makes you think I\u2019m responsible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen Zane as happy as he is right now. Even when he was with Becky. You\u2019ve been good to him, and you\u2019ve been good for him. And no matter what Mother or anyone else has to say about it, or what Mark says about your past, I want you to know that I thank you from the bottom of my heart for giving my brother a reason to live again.\u201d</p><p>Ty swallowed, surprised to find his throat tightening. \u201cWell. He did the same for me.\u201d</p><p>Annie smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re not nearly the hard-ass you want everyone to believe.\u201d</p><p>Ty rolled his eyes and waved at her. \u201cMight as well get down, take a little rest. This might take me a while,\u201d he said, voice still hoarse as he tried to stop thinking about Zane and start thinking about the tiger on the loose again.</p><p>Annie dismounted and stood beside him as he gazed out over the rolling terrain, mind churning. He glanced at Annie. \u201cI love him very much.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cGood. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>Ty held up a hand, shushing her, and cocked his head at an odd buzzing sound in the air. He had the sense it\u2019d been building for a while, but his conscious mind had only now taken notice. It was far off and echoing, so there was no way to tell where it was coming from. He peered out over the endless hills, and after a moment, he realized what it was.</p><p>\u201cEngine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think it\u2019s them?\u201d Annie asked, looking around too.</p><p>Ty nodded. There was no way an animal control vehicle would have been dispatched this quickly, not this far out. It had to be the poachers, out looking for their escapee. Ty took a deep breath. If they came across a vehicle with three to six armed men in it, he was outgunned by a long sight. There wasn\u2019t much he could do about it, and though they could hear the engine, it gave little warning to the vehicle\u2019s presence because of the odd distortion of sound in the hills. It could be two miles away, or two hills away.</p><p>\u201cThe tigers liked you, Ty; try calling out for them.\u201d</p><p>Ty hesitated, wondering if it would be imprudent to call out since they obviously weren\u2019t alone out here. He decided it was worth the risk, though. He cupped his hands around his mouth and shouted the names of both tigers as loud as he could, and then stood listening to the echo fade across the hills. He strained to see movement, but there was too much real estate to cover.</p><p>He sighed and went back to his survey of the ground. He could find no trace of the tiger\u2019s passing. It was as if the cat had mounted the hill and taken flight. It was frustrating, and not a little embarrassing after Zane had made such a fuss about his tracking skills. It also crossed his mind that they were too late. That engine may have been carrying both tigers away as they stood here.</p><p>He was on the verge of giving up when he found a divot in the earth, tiny trails where a few small pebbles had rolled from the edges of the depression. And on the lip of the innocuous circle was a tell-tale gouge. A claw.</p><p>\u201cGot him!\u201d</p><p>Annie came rushing over. She patted him on the back excitedly and then looked out over the land in the direction Ty was indicating. The hills made it hard to see far, and it made him uneasy that something as large and vicious as a tiger could be lurking behind the next knoll. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They picked their way down the hill, trailing their horses behind them. It would have been easier to let the horses find the way down, but Ty wanted to be certain he had the trail. They bottomed out into a wide arroyo, the first flat ground he\u2019d seen that was longer than a football field since they\u2019d left the preserve fence behind.</p><p>He stood and breathed out, trying to think. His horse jerked at his reins, then sidestepped and whinnied. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw a flash of vibrant color amidst the tan and green of the land.</p><p>He whipped his head around to see the tiger speeding toward them.</p> <p>\u201cOh shit,\u201d Annie gasped. She turned toward the panicking horses and fumbled in her saddlebag for the case of tranquilizer darts, and managed to jerk it out before the horses broke and fled back up the hill.</p><p>Ty\u2019s hand was on his sidearm, but it was a last resort. They were here to save the cat, not kill him.</p><p>The tiger bounded over cacti and scrub brush, and every time he leaped into the air and came back down, the skin of his face would lift and reveal razor-sharp teeth. His deadly claws dug into the earth for traction.</p><p>Annie handed Ty the dart gun, her fingers trembling.</p><p>Ty was surprised he wasn\u2019t flashing back to the last big cat who had charged him: the cougar in the mountains of West Virginia. But it had been dark then, and he hadn\u2019t seen the cat coming. Now, he stood frozen, waiting for the tiger to come within range of the darts. He was oddly calm, his body not yet recognizing the danger.</p> <p>It was unusual for the tiger to charge over open ground, in daylight no less, but Ty couldn\u2019t guess at the behavior of an animal who\u2019d been held captive all its life. He lifted the dart gun, his fingers less steady than they had been a moment before. Annie ducked behind him.</p><p>A gunning engine rent the silence, and the tiger made a sharp turn, retreating from the 4x4 tearing through the open end of the arroyo. The 4x4 careened to a stop, and a man hanging off the roll bar in the bed of the truck pointed a long-barreled rifle at the fleeing tiger.</p><p>The 4x4 displayed no markings. The men within it were armed, their faces covered. This was definitely not an official vehicle.</p><p>Ty dropped the tranquilizer gun and reached for his sidearm, drawing and firing with practiced speed. He hit the side of the truck, sending sparks flying. The shooter in the 4x4 shouted and turned his rifle on them.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d Ty muttered as the other three men in the truck, all of them bristling with weapons, took notice of them. \u201cAnnie! Get down!\u201d</p><p>Behind him, Annie screamed. Ty grabbed her and pulled, stepping in front of her to take the shot from the first man\u2019s rifle.</p> <p>It hit him in the chest, the shock of the impact knocking him backward into Annie. She caught him under his arms with another scream, but they both went tumbling backward.</p><p>Ty looked down at the dart in his chest. He grabbed it and yanked it out, surprised at how much it hurt. \u201cRun. Go,\u201d he panted, words harsh as he pushed himself to his knees and began firing. He felt Annie turn and run, hopefully after the fleeing horses where she could make a clean escape. His vision was already beginning to go dark, but he continued firing. He hit one man and saw him go sailing into the bed of the truck, rattling two large cages. Then he hit the windshield, and next a tire. He fired until his clip went empty and he sank back into the scrub grass. The world around him was turning a grayish purple.</p><p>He was distantly aware of the sound of retreating horse hooves and the truck\u2019s engine idling. Several men stalked toward him. He fumbled for his other clip, but his fingers were numb.</p><p>\u201cUsed all my damn darts,\u201d one man snarled as he pulled a gun. He sounded garbled, like he was speaking through a synthesizer.</p><p>\u201cWhat do we do with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake him. When he wakes up we\u2019ll make him track down that damn tiger for us. Then we\u2019ll use him as kitty chow.\u201d</p><p>They drew near, one of them carrying what looked like a burlap sack. Someone knelt next to Ty, and though his face wavered and morphed, Ty didn\u2019t have to see his expression to know he was in trouble. He pulled his knife from his boot\u2014his last-ditch resort\u2014and jammed it into the man\u2019s thigh.</p><p>The man screamed.</p> <p>A sound somewhere near them echoed it, a scream of anger and agony. Something primal in Ty knew what that was: the roar of an enraged predator. The men all stopped, looking up and around in a panic before turning and running back toward the safety of their vehicle, dragging the man Ty had wounded behind them.</p><p>And suddenly Ty\u2019s vision was blue. It took him a moment to realize he\u2019d fallen over and was on his back, staring at the cloudless sky. He couldn\u2019t move. Not even his fingers would twitch. He was paralyzed, losing consciousness, in the middle of the desert. Alone.</p><p>He blinked, barely able to force his eyes open again.</p><p>From somewhere, a horse neighed, and hope rose in his chest. Perhaps Annie had seen the poachers retreat and had come back for him.</p><p>A blur of color entered his field of vision. For a moment he thought he was hallucinating, but then the figure made another chuffing sound, mimicking the neigh of a horse almost perfectly. Ty realized that he wasn\u2019t hallucinating, and he wasn\u2019t alone. He was merely staring into the black and orange face of a Bengal tiger with one floppy ear.</p><p>Zane was surprised when the trail they were following made an almost 180-degree turn. The truck had circled around, heading farther into the ranch and not off it, picking its way through the nearly flat gullies between the hills. The longer they tracked it, the more they began to realize that the truck hadn\u2019t fled the scene, but rather had gone off searching for a passable route into the hills to follow the escaped tiger.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Ty and Annie are out there,\u201d Mark said as they passed over one of the horse trails that crisscrossed the ranch. \u201cThree to six men. How much ammo has he got?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs far as I know, just a knife, his service weapon, and an extra clip. It\u2019s what he carries standard. Then they each have a rifle on their saddle and that dart gun.\u201d</p><p>Mark wiped at his forehead, unable to sit still in his saddle as he grumbled and worried about his wife. Zane was worried too. But he had more faith in Ty than Mark did.</p><p>They kept following the tire tracks until Harrison paused, quieting the clopping of the horses\u2019 hooves to listen. From the distance came an echo of gunfire and, not long after, the distinct roar of a tiger. The sound registered low, and the hairs on Zane\u2019s arms rose with a prehistoric fear.</p><p>\u201cJesus.\u201d</p><p>They waited, tense and on edge, but there was nothing more. Mark was growing restless and Zane desperately wanted to head off over the hills in search of the source of the gunfire, but the desert made it impossible to locate. They could do nothing but keep to the trail they were following.</p><p>Zane soon realized he could hear a buzzing sound over the clopping of the horses, and he hissed for everyone to halt again. It swelled until they all heard it: the distant growling of a car engine far to the east. Soon, it grew fainter.</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d Harrison stood in his stirrups and tried to peer off into the distance with his binoculars. \u201cSounds like they got what they came for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr they got run off,\u201d Jamie added.</p><p>\u201cWe have to find Annie,\u201d Mark said, growing more and more agitated.</p><p>They continued on, still following the tire tracks for lack of anything better to guide them. It wasn\u2019t long before they heard the unmistakable sound of a galloping horse.</p><p>Annie topped a knoll and called out to them, her voice a panicked shout across the dancing heat waves. She urged her horse down the ridge toward them. Mark headed off after her, and he dismounted when he got close, pulling her off the horse to hug her.</p><p>Zane watched the ridge, his heart in his throat. A moment later, Ty\u2019s horse topped the hill and picked its way down. It was riderless.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Ty?\u201d Zane demanded as soon as he came up on them.</p><p>Annie shook her head. Tears streaked her dirty face. \u201cThey shot him with a dart. He shielded me from it and told me to run.\u201d She gasped out a sob. \u201cI left him there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShot him?\u201d Zane asked. His entire body had gone cold.</p><p>\u201cIt was a tranquilizer,\u201d Jamie said. \u201cMeans he could still be alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t understand.\u201d Annie had told them that animal tranquilizers weren\u2019t meant for humans, and some could kill in minutes. And then . . . this was Ty they were talking about. \u201cHe\u2019s allergic to all kinds of medication, there\u2019s no telling how he\u2019ll react to animal tranquilizers. We have to find him.\u201d</p><p>Annie gulped in air and shook her head. \u201cThe tranqs won\u2019t matter, Zane. The tiger . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe found the tiger right before they attacked us. They shot Ty, and I think he drove them away with his handgun. But . . . I left him out there with the tiger.\u201d</p><p>They backtracked Annie\u2019s trail, Harrison in the lead. Zane\u2019s mind would not stop spitting out all sorts of scenarios, every one of which ended with Ty dying alone in the desert\u2014the desert he dreamed about, the desert he screamed about in his sleep. Reacting to the tranquilizers and suffocating or having a heart attack or a seizure. Mauled by an angry tiger, shot by exotic animal smugglers as he tried to save Zane\u2019s sister.</p><p>Several times, Zane almost had to stop to throw up, but he kept himself together. He could lose his mind after they\u2019d found Ty, if he needed to.</p><p>Harrison halted on top of a high knoll and pulled his binoculars out again, scanning the land. He stopped and tensed, sitting up straighter. \u201cFound him.\u201d</p><p>Zane urged his horse forward. \u201cWhere? Is he okay? Let me see.\u201d</p><p>Harrison lowered the binoculars and shook his head, giving Zane a look that made Zane\u2019s heart leap into his throat. \u201cI can\u2019t let you see, son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>Harrison hesitated, glancing at the others before he choked out, \u201cThe tiger found him too.\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s stomach turned and his vision started to narrow. \u201cNo. Let me see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, son.\u201d</p><p>Zane spurred his horse up the hill, reaching across the horn of his father\u2019s saddle to snatch the binoculars from him. He aimed them in the direction Harrison had been looking. It took his trembling hand a moment to find the splash of color, but when he did, the bile rose in his throat.</p><p>The tiger lay recumbent in the middle of an arroyo, protected on all sides by low hills. He could see Ty lying nearly under the big cat. The red buff on his head was hard to miss, as was the lime green cast on his arm. The tiger was licking and gnawing on his hand like a kitten playing with a ball of yarn. Zane could see no blood, though. No carnage. He focused in closer, desperate to spot a sign of life from his lover.</p><p>The tiger rolled onto his back, powerful legs stretching out to the side. Ty\u2019s cast was in his mouth between gleaming white teeth. He rested his head on Ty\u2019s outstretched arm as he chewed.</p><p>Zane frowned. Then he caught it, the barest of movement from Ty. The fingers of his right hand curled in a come-hither motion.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s moving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably muscle spasms, Zane,\u201d Mark said, voice gentle and careful. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but . . . that\u2019s a goddamn tiger down there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s alive. He\u2019s . . .\u201d Zane held his breath, hardly daring to hope. \u201cI think he\u2019s rubbing the tiger\u2019s nose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Annie asked through a quiet sob.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s goddamn petting the tiger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPetting the tiger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going down there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cZane, wait!\u201d Annie cried as Zane urged his horse down into the arroyo.</p><p>At the sound of her shout, the tiger sat up in a rush and focused on him. His horse balked, dancing sideways at it caught wind of the big cat\u2019s scent. The tiger lunged to his feet, letting out a roar that froze the very marrow in Zane\u2019s bones.</p><p>Zane was peripherally aware of the horses panicking. Ty\u2019s bay broke away from Jamie and ran. It took all of Zane\u2019s skill to get his own animal under control again.</p><p>Zane stopped his horse from going closer, but the damage was done. The tiger bent and took Ty\u2019s arm in its mouth, pulling him by his wrist across the arroyo bottom. Ty didn\u2019t move, didn\u2019t struggle. Zane\u2019s stomach knotted, and he had to fight the urge to retch as he watched Ty\u2019s limp body being dragged across the ground, at the mercy of one of the largest, most dangerous predators on earth.</p><p>Annie joined him on foot, breathless and pale. \u201cTigers are territorial, Zane. Either Ty is his meal, or Ty is his friend. Either way, he sees us as a threat. We have to drive him off or tranquilize him before we get anywhere near Ty. And I lost the dart gun.\u201d</p><p>Zane nodded, dizzy and ill. Annie reached for his saddle, pulling the rifle out of its scabbard and pointing it into the air. She fired.</p><p>The tiger jolted away, bounding a few yards before hesitating and looking back at Ty\u2019s limp body. He seemed confused and intimidated by their aggressive behavior. Annie fired again and again, each time driving the tiger further away. Zane urged his agitated horse forward, and the animal just seemed glad to be getting away from the gunshots as it barreled down the hill. Annie fired the last round in the rifle as Zane\u2019s horse charged, and the tiger turned and ran, disappearing into the hills.</p><p>Zane dismounted while his horse was still moving, hitting the ground running and then sliding to his knees in the scrub brush next to Ty. Ty\u2019s eyes were open and unblinking, his body contorted in the position the tiger had left him.</p><p>\u201cBaby?\u201d Zane said through a broken sob as he reached for Ty\u2019s face.</p><p>Ty closed his eyes, a painfully slow gesture, and when he opened them again he was staring at Zane.</p><p>\u201cOh Jesus, Ty. Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>Ty closed his eyes again. He tried to speak, lips barely moving. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Zane asked as he leaned closer.</p><p>\u201cI hate Texas.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 8</p> <p>Zane held Ty\u2019s limp body in the saddle. It wasn\u2019t comfortable, but Ty seemed to have no control over his limbs and little awareness of where he was or even who he was. Zane couldn\u2019t allow him to be strapped to a saddle like a dead man, so he rode with Ty in front of him.</p><p>Joe and Cody greeted them when they trotted into the main yard, running to help get Ty off the horse when they realized he wasn\u2019t conscious. Ty\u2019s horse had beaten them there, tipping the others off that something had gone wrong. A police vehicle and an ambulance were already on the way, even though Joe confessed they\u2019d all just thought Ty had fallen off his horse.</p><p>Ty was a dead weight in their hands, and they had to carry him into the house together. Annie ran to her truck and retrieved the well-stocked bag she took with her on calls, and then she followed them in.</p><p>Zane stood in the yard, stunned and staring at the open front door.</p><p>\u201cZ?\u201d</p> <p>He turned to his father.</p><p>\u201cYou fall apart later, you hear me? Your man saved my little girl today. You go in there and be strong for him.\u201d</p><p>Zane blinked at him, and then nodded. He headed for the house, putting one foot in front of the other. It was the only way he could manage to function.</p><p>The boys had placed Ty on one of the sofas in the den. Annie was checking his pulse and blood pressure.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand why he was even conscious,\u201d she said to Zane when she realized he was there. \u201cThat dart should have dropped him before he could get off a shot, much less empty his clip. And he\u2019s still partially responsive, even now. I don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>Zane nodded and ran his hand over Ty\u2019s forehead, then leaned down to kiss it. \u201cHe has strange reactions. Two Tylenol will wire him up just like one of those five-hour energy shots. Benadryl makes him sick. Vicodin makes him stop breathing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cChrist, there\u2019s no telling what he\u2019s going to do with this! I know he pulled the dart out; maybe he didn\u2019t get a full dose. Maybe it hit bone. Get his shirt open, let\u2019s see where it hit him.\u201d</p><p>Zane pulled out his knife and put the blade to the collar of Ty\u2019s Henley.</p><p>Ty reached up and grabbed his wrist. Annie screamed and dropped her stethoscope.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t cut the shirt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, Ty, are you awake?\u201d Zane tossed the knife to the floor and dropped to his knees beside Ty.</p><p>\u201cI hate Texas,\u201d Ty said without opening his eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhy does he keep saying that?\u201d Mark asked from the doorway where he stood watching.</p><p>\u201cObviously, he hates Texas!\u201d Zane snapped. \u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t he? It keeps trying to kill him!\u201d</p> <p>Ty\u2019s head lolled to the side.</p><p>\u201cTy?\u201d Annie asked as she leaned closer to him. \u201cCan you hear us?\u201d</p><p>Ty groaned.</p><p>\u201cBaby?\u201d Zane whispered. He rested his chin on the couch, letting his nose touch Ty\u2019s. He closed his eyes and put his hand against Ty\u2019s cheek. \u201cAre you in there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel weird, Zane.\u201d</p><p>Zane fought back a sob of laughter and ran his hand through Ty\u2019s hair.</p><p>\u201cWhat in the world is going on in here?\u201d Beverly demanded as she came into the room. She saw Ty on the sofa and put her hands over her mouth. \u201cOh my God!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe got shot with a tranquilizer dart,\u201d Mark told her. He and the others were staying out of the way, watching from the doorway.</p><p>\u201cWill he live?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe think so,\u201d Annie answered as she checked his heartbeat again.</p><p>\u201cOh my. We have guests coming, is he bleeding on the upholstery?\u201d</p><p>Zane raised his head, meeting Annie\u2019s wide eyes. Zane pushed to his feet and rounded on his mother, fire boiling through his veins.</p><p>\u201cYou bitch,\u201d he growled, sounding stunned even to his own ears.</p><p>Her eyes widened and her jaw dropped.</p><p>Joe turned and ran for the door, yelling, \u201cHarrison!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow dare you talk to me like that!\u201d Beverly shouted.</p><p>Zane felt Annie\u2019s hand on his arm, pulling at him and trying to calm him. He shook her off. \u201cThe only thing you give a damn about is your reputation and that goddamned party. You have a man who could be dying on your couch and you\u2019re bitching about the upholstery?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said he wasn\u2019t dying!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot the point, Mother! Jesus Christ!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s his job to risk his life for law and order, and that is precisely what he\u2019s doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not here because it\u2019s his job! He\u2019s here because he loves me!\u201d</p><p>Beverly\u2019s eyes widened and she shook her head, looking from Ty, lying half-conscious on the couch, and back to Zane. \u201cWell, the young man is obviously confused, Zane. Shame on you for taking advantage. As soon as he wakes, I expect him to be on the first flight home.\u201d Then she turned and stormed out of the room.</p><p>Zane shouted in frustration and ran both hands through his hair.</p><p>\u201cZane,\u201d Annie whispered.</p><p>Zane glared at the threshold, peripherally aware of Mark and Cody watching him, and of Joe and Harrison coming through the front door.</p><p>\u201cZane,\u201d Annie said again, more insistent.</p><p>Zane turned to look down at her and Ty. She was perched on the edge of the couch near his hip, her hand on Ty\u2019s chest. Ty\u2019s fingers grazed the oriental carpet. His head had lolled to the side, and his eyes were closed.</p><p>Zane swallowed hard and went to kneel by his side again.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s gone,\u201d Annie whispered.</p><p>Zane looked up at her with wide eyes.</p><p>She gasped and put out her hand. \u201cI mean he\u2019s unconscious! Not gone! Just unconscious.\u201d She winced and gave the others a helpless shrug as she put her hand over her mouth.</p><p>Zane studied Ty\u2019s face. \u201cI love you, Ty,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>He got no response. Annie was feeling for Ty\u2019s pulse again. She nodded, but she still looked concerned. \u201cThe ambulance is on the way. They can monitor him in the hospital. I suspect he\u2019s going to be out for a while. He fought it. He fought it hard.\u201d</p><p>Zane ran his fingers through Ty\u2019s hair, letting his thumb graze over Ty\u2019s cheek.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what he does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re keeping him around. Why not send him home? He obviously can\u2019t handle himself in such a rough environment,\u201d Beverly said as they sat at the dinner table.</p><p>Zane had been seething ever since they\u2019d loaded Ty\u2019s limp body into the ambulance and he\u2019d come back into the house to find one of the maids hard at work, scrubbing the dust and dirt off the upholstery.</p><p>He\u2019d gone to the hospital, but as soon as visiting hours were over, he\u2019d been forced to leave. He wasn\u2019t family, and though he\u2019d tried to argue that Ty might be disoriented when he awoke, maybe even destructive if someone familiar wasn\u2019t with him, the officials at the hospital had heard none of it. To add insult to injury, now he was being forced to sit through his mother\u2019s opinions at dinner.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s . . . actually quite capable, Mother,\u201d Mark said, and Zane could see his brother-in-law\u2019s feathers ruffling too.</p><p>\u201cGod knows what would have happened had he not been with me,\u201d Annie tried.</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have been there in the first place,\u201d Beverly said. \u201cI\u2019ll have Manuel drive him to the airport when he\u2019s discharged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother, stop,\u201d Zane said through gritted teeth.</p><p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s quite uncouth of him to just drop out of the sky, uninvited, and expect you to play host, Zane.\u201d Beverly spread her salad across her plate, unaware of how angry Zane was getting.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d Zane ground out. He glanced at the others before turning his attention to his mother. \u201cI was hoping to avoid this, Mother, but you really leave me no choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Z, slow down,\u201d Harrison said.</p><p>Beverly\u2019s eyes widened before she regained control and cocked her head at Zane.</p><p>\u201cTy\u2019s not just my partner and he\u2019s not just my friend. And he\u2019s certainly not uninvited or unwelcome. He\u2019s my boyfriend, we\u2019ve been together for almost a year now, and he\u2019s not leaving.\u201d</p><p>Beverly stared at him, not blinking, not even twitching. \u201cBoyfriend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. We\u2019ve been living together for months. And I\u2019ve been seriously thinking about asking him to marry me.\u201d</p><p>Annie gave a little golf clap before she could get control of herself, and she bit her lip.</p><p>\u201cThat is . . . scandalous! Zane!\u201d Beverly stood. \u201cHow dare you come into my home and say such things!\u201d</p><p>Zane stood as well, refusing to let her feel superior with higher ground.</p><p>\u201cIs it really so much worse than letting me kill myself with drink and drugs? He\u2019s the only reason I\u2019m still here!\u201d</p><p>Beverly\u2019s eyes hardened, her nostrils flaring. \u201cYou\u2019re still here because of him? Not because your family needed you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s my family too, Mother. He\u2019s in that hospital alone because he sacrificed himself for my family. And because everyone else thinks just like you, I can\u2019t even go and be with him!\u201d</p><p>Beverly took a deep breath and looked around the table. Zane could feel all their eyes on him, but he didn\u2019t look away from his mother. Rage boiled deep inside him, and whether she deserved it or not, she had become the target.</p><p>She schooled her features, putting on a painfully familiar mask. It almost sickened him, recognizing himself in her, seeing what his future might have held. An emotionless, tactical assault on the world. Not even Becky had been able to steer Zane off the path he\u2019d started on, rising in the ranks to power, taking the world by both horns and bending it to his will.</p><p>Ty was the only one who\u2019d ever been able to break him out of what his mother had taught him, to show him what a life well-lived and hard-felt could be like.</p><p>Before he could allow himself to dwell on it anymore, or to say anything to his mother he might regret, he turned and walked away, leaving his family in stunned silence behind him.</p><p>He almost barreled over Sadie as he left the room.</p><p>\u201cUncle Z, will you play with me?\u201d she asked, tiny voice full of hope, completely oblivious to the drama around her.</p><p>Zane forced himself to exhale and knelt in front of her. \u201cOf course, sweetheart.\u201d He tried a smile. She climbed onto his knee and he gave her a hug as he stood. \u201cYou want to go call and check on Ty first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill he play with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably not, baby doll. He\u2019s asleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen no. Let\u2019s go play!\u201d</p><p>Zane couldn\u2019t help but laugh as he obediently carried her to the stairs. So much for Ty\u2019s ability to inspire undying devotion in every creature he encountered.</p><p>Zane sat on the front steps, eyes unseeing, thinking of Ty and worrying. The screen door behind him creaked and shut with a snap, and heels on the wooden planks approached.</p><p>From somewhere in the distance, a tiger roared.</p><p>Zane stood to stare into the night, shivering at the sound.</p><p>\u201cOh my,\u201d his mother whispered.</p><p>Zane tore his eyes from the moonlit landscape to look at her. She seemed nervous. Why had she come out here? He could count on one hand the number of heart-to-hearts they\u2019d shared over the years, and before every one, she\u2019d looked like that.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s an unpleasant sound.\u201d</p><p>Zane nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s because the roar hits a frequency so low we can\u2019t hear it. It\u2019s called infrasound. Causes a sense of terror. A roaring tiger can actually paralyze with fear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know that, Zane?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTy told me.\u201d</p><p>She sighed and looked out over the darkened vista of the ranch. Zane studied her profile. \u201cWas it true, what you said?\u201d she asked finally. \u201cAre you going to ask him to marry you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true. I think.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed hard. \u201cI don\u2019t know that I can live with it, Zane.\u201d</p><p>Zane stared at her, chest tightening. The tiger roared again, and he tore his eyes away from her to look into the darkness. They had secured all the animals, locking the horses safely away in the barns and putting all the hands to work at wrangling in the other livestock. They were still exposed in pens, but they were closer to the house. His spine tingled as the tiger continued to roar. \u201cHe\u2019s getting closer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s quite unsettling. What\u2019s being done about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve got animal control people coming from Austin to hunt him. So far, the locals aren\u2019t having any luck. Probably because they\u2019re still looking way out near the preserve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe should call them and inform them he\u2019s come this way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnnie\u2019s on it. She thinks he followed us here. That he tracked Ty\u2019s scent here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodness.\u201d</p><p>Zane nodded. Of course the tiger would track Ty across miles and miles of desert. It was Ty. He attracted death and disaster and undying loyalty like nobody else.</p><p>\u201cDid Mr. Grady truly save Annabelle\u2019s life?\u201d</p><p>Zane nodded. \u201cAnd mine. Many times over.\u201d</p><p>Beverly sighed. \u201cDesperate times call for unusual allies,\u201d she said. She glanced at him. \u201cI phoned the hospital and explained the situation to them. They said you were welcome to stay with him until he wakes.\u201d</p><p>Zane whipped his head around. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, though she didn\u2019t look pleased with herself. Zane lunged toward her and hugged her, picking her up off the ground. She gasped and made a gurgling noise, and when Zane set her down, she put a hand to her hair. \u201cMy goodness, Zane.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He took her by her shoulders. \u201cThank you!\u201d</p><p>He hopped off the porch and ran to his truck, leaving her looking bewildered.</p><p>Hours later, Zane was sitting by Ty\u2019s bed. Ty had shown signs of waking, but after a night of lying in the hospital as Zane paced beside him, he was still unconscious.</p> <p>They had run all kinds of tests and discovered exactly what type of dart had been used. They\u2019d given Ty the appropriate human antidote, and Zane had set the local law enforcement on a hunt for any of the same that were missing from area vets.</p><p>Then he\u2019d called their boss, Dan McCoy, who\u2019d been supremely pissed to learn that Ty was unconscious in Texas and not in DC doing whatever lie he\u2019d told to get out of work.</p><p>They\u2019d done all they could for Ty, and though the doctors seemed concerned that he was still unconscious after receiving the antidote, Zane kept telling himself that with the way Ty reacted to medications, he merely needed to sleep it off. The antidote had made him restless briefly, but it hadn\u2019t woken him.</p><p>Zane found his eyes drifting shut and his head drooping. He jerked awake and looked around, surprised.</p><p>\u201cZane.\u201d</p> <p>Zane surged forward, kneeling on the edge of the bed to look down at Ty, but Ty\u2019s eyes were closed and he wasn\u2019t moving. There was no indication that he\u2019d spoken at all.</p><p>Zane suspected he was beginning to imagine things. \u201cBaby?\u201d</p><p>Ty\u2019s eyes fluttered open for the briefest of seconds before closing again.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re in there,\u201d Zane whispered. He leaned closer, brushing his lips against Ty\u2019s cheek, then stretched out next to Ty and laid his head down. He stared at Ty\u2019s profile, willing him to move, praying to see another flutter of his eyelashes.</p><p>Ty finally parted his lips, taking in a deep breath. He said Zane\u2019s name, a mere puff of air. Zane pushed up and looked down at him, brushing his hand over Ty\u2019s face and then sliding his finger over Ty\u2019s lower lip, just like Ty did to him when he was asleep. Ty\u2019s eyes opened again, staring past Zane at the ceiling.</p><p>\u201cTy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid we get hit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Ty, no. You aren\u2019t there. You\u2019re here with me. You\u2019re safe.\u201d</p><p>Ty reached for him, gripping him with alarming strength. His eyes closed, and he started speaking in Farsi.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Ty, I don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>Ty opened his eyes to look up into Zane\u2019s. He spoke again, sounding desperate and almost scared.</p><p>Zane had heard his lover speaking Farsi before, oftentimes in his sleep. But never in a waking dream, never while Ty was looking into his eyes and trying to communicate with him. He licked his lips and reached to the bedside table for Ty\u2019s phone. He wasn\u2019t too proud to call for help.</p><p>Only after Nick O\u2019Flaherty answered, sounding sleepy and sullen, did Zane realize it was the middle of the night. He winced, but he was too worried to apologize.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Garrett, I need your help.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTy\u2019s speaking in Farsi and I need you to translate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust . . . I\u2019ll explain later, I\u2019m afraid he\u2019s going to fall asleep again.\u201d Zane pushed the speaker button and held the phone out.</p><p>\u201cYou people get into the weirdest trouble,\u201d Nick said.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s he saying?\u201d</p><p>Nick was silent as Ty mumbled. After a few moments, he said, \u201cWell first of all, that\u2019s not Farsi. It\u2019s Dari.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does if you don\u2019t speak Dari.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you speak Dari?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Just expect a little more accuracy from the likes of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cO\u2019Flaherty, come on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s saying he\u2019s thirsty. And he\u2019s asking if you can help him. \u2018I\u2019m U.S. military, can you direct me to the nearest base?\u2019 Garrett, this sounds a lot like what we were both saying after they picked us up in the desert. I asked for directions in my sleep for months after. Is he drugged? Hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnimal tranquilizers.\u201d</p><p>Nick was silent. \u201cOf course. That should have been my first guess. He\u2019s also saying the ground is cold, if that means anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Zane said with a sigh.</p><p>Ty spoke again, the words slurring. Nick started laughing.</p><p>\u201cWhat? What\u2019d he say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said his hovercraft is full of eels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Is that code for something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Nick still sounded amused. \u201cHe\u2019s just muttering, Garrett. He\u2019s high. Lost.\u201d</p><p>Zane inhaled deeply and nodded, almost disappointed that Ty hadn\u2019t been trying to communicate something more than his need for water and a blanket.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Nick added solemnly. \u201cHe\u2019s okay until he starts speaking Russian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRussian? Since when does Ty know Russian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t. You guys need help? Where are you, what\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no. We\u2019re okay. Just a dustup in Texas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith animal tranquilizers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll fill you in later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am. You sound hungover.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Canada Day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, I\u2019m in Canada.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s Canada Day! Come on, Garrett!\u201d</p><p>Zane snorted.</p><p>\u201cCall me when he wakes up, okay? Tell him I said to take it easy on the hard stuff.\u201d</p><p>Zane huffed and set the phone down, then reached for the glass of water by the bed. He offered it to Ty, helping him raise his head. After a few swallows, Ty was calm again, his eyes closed, his face relaxed and serene as Zane laid his head back on the pillow.</p><p>Zane studied him like the unsolved mystery he was. He remembered overhearing Julian Cross ask how Ty knew Russian Sambo after Ty had taken him down in a scuffle. He knew Ty had been paid off to keep his silence about the way he\u2019d been discharged from the military. And Mark had alleged a murder on Ty\u2019s part when he had been in the service.</p><p>But he had no doubt that he knew who Ty was now, inside and out. He knew every one of Ty\u2019s quirks and weak spots and favorite things. He knew what Ty found funny and what annoyed him. He knew what would break his heart. He knew how to touch him to drive him wild, and when to back off when Ty was having a bad day. He knew that Ty was kind and loyal and funny, that he had a deep sense of honor and righteousness. He knew that Ty would die to save a stranger, and kill to save a friend. That was the type of man he was.</p><p>He knew who Ty was now. But he suspected that the Ty he knew was a different man from the one Ty had been. The man who\u2019d once made hardened Marines uneasy. He reached out and put his hand on Ty\u2019s forehead. \u201cWho were you, Ty?\u201d</p><p>Ty responded with his name, rank, and serial number. The words were mumbled, but with an undercurrent of defiance and threat. The last person who\u2019d received those answers from Ty hadn\u2019t lived through the interrogation. A chill ran down Zane\u2019s spine. He didn\u2019t ask another question, merely laid his head down beside Ty\u2019s to sleep.</p><p>Ty woke disoriented, just as Zane had known he would. But he was able to answer the questions two determined nurses asked\u2014with the assistance of some creative hand signals from Zane as he stood behind them\u2014and he was grudgingly released. He fell asleep with his head in Zane\u2019s lap on the way home, and Zane needed three others to help him carry Ty into the house and to a bed upstairs.</p><p>Zane was still asleep, curled up next to Ty, when he heard the doorbell ring. He raised his head, confused about where he was for a few seconds. It was his old bedroom, but everything about it had long ago changed. Not even the bed was the same. The ceiling still had that same crack in it, though, the one Zane had often traced with his eyes when he couldn\u2019t sleep.</p><p>He heard voices from downstairs. It was Thursday, and the ranch was open for business. But no one ever came into the house unless they were very special or very rich, and Zane couldn\u2019t imagine Joe or Cody letting anyone get this far without guiding them toward the barn where they were supposed to be.</p><p>Zane looked down at Ty, running his hand over his face. Ty didn\u2019t move, didn\u2019t even twitch. Zane checked his pulse. Everything was as it should have been, and his pulse was strong. A man of Ty\u2019s size should have been able to shake off the tranquilizers by now, but there was never any guessing how Ty would respond to such things.</p><p>Zane rolled out of bed with a heavy feeling. There was nothing he could do for his partner right now, and he hated it.</p><p>He slid his feet into his shoes and rubbed at his eyes as he headed for the door. He didn\u2019t even bother looking in a mirror. He just ran his hands through his unruly hair as he thumped down the stairs.</p><p>He stopped short when he saw four men sitting in the formal living room. His mother was there, standing by the doorway, and his father was seated as he talked with the visitors.</p><p>Zane approached carefully, listening to the conversation.</p><p>\u201c. . . figured we\u2019d come by and see how he was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right neighborly of you,\u201d Harrison said, though his voice was cool.</p><p>Beverly turned to see Zane standing there, and she reached out and patted him on the shoulder, moving him until he was leaning against the wall, out of sight. She let him go and turned back to her visitors.</p><p>A tingle of apprehension ran through Zane. His mother obviously thought something was wrong and wanted him to listen without being seen.</p><p>\u201cWell, when you hear a man got mauled by a tiger on the next ranch over, it does cause some concern.\u201d</p><p>Zane knew the voice. It was Stuart, the asshole from the bar.</p><p>\u201cHe hasn\u2019t woken yet,\u201d Beverly said, her voice cold. \u201cHe\u2019s still at the hospital. We don\u2019t know what happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo he ain\u2019t told anyone the details?\u201d Stuart asked.</p><p>Beverly didn\u2019t answer, and Harrison cleared his throat. \u201cWe can\u2019t say what happened. Won\u2019t know \u2019til he wakes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he wakes at all,\u201d Beverly interjected.</p><p>Zane turned his head sharply, trying to see his mother\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cThat bad, huh?\u201d Stuart asked. The other three visitors began to murmur their apologies.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in quite bad shape,\u201d Beverly said with a nod.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a shame.\u201d Stuart sighed, like he was standing.</p><p>Beverly put her hand behind the wall and waved at Zane urgently, shooing him away. Zane retreated to the alcove that used to be a butler\u2019s nook when the house was first built, and flattened himself there.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll just be heading on, then. Our regards to the rest of your family,\u201d Stuart said, and soon the four men were filing out.</p><p>Zane recognized them all as the men from the honky-tonk, Stuart and his fellow ranch hands from Cactus Creek. They were dusty and dressed in their work clothes. It looked as if they\u2019d come here directly from their ranch. Stuart was limping, trying not to drag his foot. Harrison walked them out, and as soon as the door was shut, Zane stepped out of the alcove. Harrison and Beverly both turned to look at him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to have excluded you, Zane, but I felt you would prefer to hear and not be seen,\u201d Beverly said. She smoothed her hands down her suit in a rare gesture of discomfort.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Mother,\u201d Zane said, surprised by her awareness.</p><p>\u201cI felt they weren\u2019t here under honest pretenses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey sure as sin weren\u2019t,\u201d Harrison growled. \u201cTrying to figure out how much Ty told us about what happened and whether he was like to wake up again.\u201d</p><p>Zane nodded. He\u2019d gathered as much from the snippets he\u2019d heard.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d you tell them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTold them we found him unconscious being eaten by a tiger.\u201d</p><p>Zane couldn\u2019t help but laugh.</p><p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t even take pause at that, like that was normal,\u201d Beverly huffed.</p><p>\u201cThey kept digging to see if anybody saw anything besides the tiger,\u201d Harrison told Zane.</p><p>\u201cAwfully suspicious,\u201d Zane grumbled. \u201cDid you see him limping?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? That mean something to you?\u201d Harrison asked.</p><p>Zane nodded. \u201cTy\u2019s knife was gone. I\u2019d bet anything he put it in that man\u2019s leg.\u201d</p><p>Harrison nodded, looking both impressed and worried. \u201cYou think your boy can identify them?\u201d</p><p>Zane shrugged. Ty had once been able to look at a poker table full of people and tell Zane each player\u2019s tell, down to the type of cuff links one man liked to play with when he was nervous. But there was no telling what details he\u2019d been able to notice after being struck with a dart, alone and under fire. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell. Soon as he comes to, we\u2019ll call the sheriff. I\u2019m going to get Mark and Annie to come here and hole up, where we can be sure they\u2019re safe.\u201d</p><p>Zane nodded, and he looked at his mother again as Harrison left the foyer. Beverly met his eyes, then gave him a nod. Her expression was a mixture of concern and pride, something Zane could honestly say he\u2019d never seen on her before. Was it possible that she was just now realizing that what he\u2019d done with his life was both dangerous and worthwhile? Or was she merely circling the wagons, protecting the family and the ranch like always?</p><p>She walked away without saying anything, and Zane put his hand to his chest to rub at his sternum, trying to dispel the tightness there.</p><p>Maybe there was hope yet.</p><p>They were all gathered for dinner when they heard the shuffling of feet coming down the grand staircase. Zane pushed out of his chair and darted into the foyer, where Ty was staring at the front door as if he was trying to figure out where he was. He turned and met Zane\u2019s eyes for a long moment. There wasn\u2019t much recognition there, and his face was expressionless. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTy?\u201d Zane said carefully as the rest of the family joined him.</p><p>Ty\u2019s gaze took them all in before landing on Zane again. \u201cI didn\u2019t know they had elephants in Texas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Zane asked. Had Ty simply lost his tenuous grip on reality in the twenty-plus hours he\u2019d been unconscious?</p> <p>\u201cI feel like one sat on me.\u201d Ty rubbed at his chest and swallowed with difficulty. He sniffed at the air. \u201cIs that steak?\u201d</p><p>Zane laughed and went to hug him. Ty rested his chin on Zane\u2019s shoulder and hugged him back. Every muscle in him that was usually hard and tense felt relaxed when Zane touched him.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>Ty nodded. \u201cHow long was I out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost a whole day.\u201d</p> <p>Ty closed his eyes. \u201cLike the worst acid trip ever.\u201d</p><p>Zane laughed and hugged him harder, just because he could.</p><p>\u201cYou told me your hovercraft was full of eels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn Dari.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s stupid,\u201d Ty said.</p> <p>\u201cWell,\u201d Beverly said, prim and proper as ever. \u201cAs glad as we all are that Mr. Grady is well, we don\u2019t want dinner to go cold, now, do we?\u201d She gave a little clap and turned on her heel to head back to the dining room.</p><p>Sadie went skipping after her grandmother, but the rest of them ignored her and gathered to greet Ty. Annie hugged him fiercely, thanking him and almost tearing up when she apologized for leaving him to be eaten by the tiger. Mark gripped his hand and met his eyes, giving him a mere nod that Ty returned. It must have been a Marine thing, because that was the only exchange they shared.</p><p>Harrison gave his shoulder a squeeze as he shook his hand, telling him he was glad to see him up and around.</p><p>Beverly called from the dining room, sounding tense.</p><p>They all shuffled off after her, grumbling mutinously. Ty watched them go. \u201cI think your mom would do really well with a tranq to the ass,\u201d he said flatly.</p><p>Zane couldn\u2019t help but smile.</p><p>\u201cA nice parting shot from me to her. What do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you need food. And then a shower.\u201d</p> <p>They\u2019d cleaned him up after making sure he\u2019d live, taking great pains to make sure they hadn\u2019t missed any injuries. Zane had put fresh clothes on him, borrowed from Harrison, so he\u2019d at least be clean when they put him to bed. But he\u2019d still been dragged across the ground by a tiger and not showered afterward.</p><p>Ty slipped his arm around Zane\u2019s waist. \u201cHow\u2019d you know what I said if it was in Dari?\u201d</p><p>Zane grinned, relieved that Ty\u2019s mind was working well enough to ask that. \u201cCalled O\u2019Flaherty, had him translate. I was afraid you were trying to tell me something important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI called McCoy too, told him what was going on.\u201d</p><p>Ty winced.</p><p>\u201cHe asked if you were catatonic,\u201d Zane said, voice trembling as he tried not to laugh.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt kind of is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll never hear the end of this shit.\u201d</p><p>Zane laughed and squeezed him close. Ty patted his arm and stopped walking. To Zane\u2019s surprise, Ty was grinning.</p><p>\u201cStars and stripes, Zane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the Fourth of July. I saw stars, and then I saw stripes.\u201d He began to laugh like it was the most hilarious thing he\u2019d ever heard, doubling over and grabbing Zane\u2019s arm to hold himself up as he cackled. Though Zane knew it was the lingering effects of the drugs on Ty\u2019s system, he couldn\u2019t help but laugh too. Whether he was laughing with Ty or at him, he wasn\u2019t sure.</p><p>\u201cCome on, you stoner,\u201d Zane whispered. He pulled Ty, still giggling, into the dining room. Ty calmed and cleared his throat, attempting a little decorum.</p><p>Beverly was quick to greet them with a disapproving glare. \u201cMr. Grady, I suppose we all owe you a debt of gratitude,\u201d she said, sounding like she was trying to chew a light bulb.</p><p>Ty sat in the chair Zane pulled out for him, and he nodded, still too sedate to engage her.</p><p>Zane wondered if they couldn\u2019t just pack up and go home now. They\u2019d gotten enough of a lead to give to the local authorities, and Ty didn\u2019t deserve the abuse he was putting up with for Zane\u2019s sake. Not from those yahoos in the bar, not from the elements, and not from Beverly Carter-Garrett.</p><p>\u201cI do hope we\u2019ll leave this to the real authorities now, though?\u201d</p><p>Zane glared down the table at her.</p><p>\u201cWhat real authorities?\u201d Annie asked, her tone acerbic. \u201cThe sheriff is overrun, and animal control are chasing their asses around a hot potato because people are reporting loose tigers from here to Austin. It\u2019s caused a panic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is none of our concern.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will be when that tiger gets hungry enough. We all know he\u2019s still on the C and G.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnnie.\u201d</p><p>Annie shrugged, but went back to her meal without provoking Beverly further.</p><p>Beverly looked around the table. \u201cWe don\u2019t want any more incidents drawing unwanted attention to us.\u201d</p><p>Out of the corner of his eye, Zane saw Ty reach for the wine in front of him and toss back the entire glass in one gulp. Zane winced. That wasn\u2019t going to react with those tranquilizers well.</p><p>\u201cMother, we can\u2019t let this drop now. Ty\u2019s life is in danger. You saw that this morning when they came here fishing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho went fishing?\u201d Ty asked.</p><p>\u201cForgive me for being callous, but if he\u2019d leave, he wouldn\u2019t be in danger anymore. As it is, he\u2019s attracting trouble to our ranch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I smell like tiger breath,\u201d Ty muttered.</p><p>\u201cNow Beverly, none of this is Ty\u2019s fault,\u201d Harrison said, voice calm as he handed Ty his own wine glass. Ty whispered a thank you and downed that as well. Zane almost said something, but the conversation distracted him from his disapproval.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll keep coming back until there\u2019s nothing to come back for,\u201d Mark interjected. \u201cAnnie was out there too, and if she saw them, they may have seen her. They\u2019ll know it was her, and she\u2019s in danger too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need Zane and Ty here, Beverly,\u201d Harrison said. \u201cCircling the wagons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I can see how much use that particular wagon is going to do us,\u201d Beverly said, nodding toward Ty.</p><p>Ty stared at her, and Zane could see it coming from a mile away. He had two, maybe three seconds to stop his partner from tearing his mother\u2019s head off.</p><p>He sat back and crossed his arms instead.</p><p>Ty\u2019s eyes drifted from Beverly, who sat stiff and proper, waiting for his retort, and landed on Sadie instead. She smiled shyly at him and stuck a piece of chicken in her mouth. Zane watched in fascination as Ty gave her a half-smile and returned his attention to the tabletop.</p><p>Everyone else noticed it too. They all looked at Sadie, who was still grinning and chewing.</p><p>Ty cleared his throat. \u201cIf you want me to leave because you think I\u2019m putting your family in danger, then I will.\u201d He met Beverly\u2019s eyes, then looked at Sadie again. \u201cBut I would like to stay and help protect your family.\u201d</p><p>The table was silent, but for the sounds of Sadie eating. The emotionless mask on Beverly\u2019s face was back, but Zane could see her struggling with her response. Ty had realized that trading barbs with her was not the way to handle it\u2014that a direct, sincere approach was much more likely to throw her off her game. It was a little unnerving sometimes, watching Ty manipulate others. Zane couldn\u2019t help but wonder how many times Ty had done that to him without him realizing it.</p><p>Beverly finally exhaled and gave a curt nod, blinking rapidly. \u201cIf you believe yourself fit enough for the job, Mr. Grady, then so be it.\u201d</p><p>Everyone was silent, letting the tension settle over the table. Soon enough, Harrison picked up his fork and knife and began to cut into his steak.</p><p>As they ate, the tension slowly broke, and they filled Ty in on what he\u2019d missed. He sat with a frown, listening and offering little in response. When they were done, Ty sat in silence, still nodding his head, staring at the table.</p><p>\u201cTy?\u201d</p><p>Ty looked up as if Zane had splashed him with cold water. \u201cI don\u2019t think this is about tigers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Ty glanced around and gave a small shrug. \u201cI don\u2019t think the tigers are the target.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we caught them in the act. We saw them poaching the tigers,\u201d Mark insisted.</p><p>\u201cJust give it a little time,\u201d Zane said more gently. \u201cLet your mind catch up to the tranquilizers, okay?\u201d</p><p>Ty eyes flickered to Mark, but he nodded. \u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell. You all will excuse me. I have business to attend to.\u201d Beverly stood without waiting for a reply and made her way out of the room.</p><p>Zane sat back, watching Ty, a sense of foreboding creeping over him despite everything. Ty knew something he wasn\u2019t sharing, and Zane intended to find out what it was tonight.</p><p>Ty sat with his booted feet propped on the railing of the large porch, rocking himself in a wooden chair. He held one last glass of wine in one hand and a slim cheroot in the other, secure in the knowledge that he deserved to indulge in both vices. The sheriff had come and gone, taking his statement without even a raised eyebrow.</p><p>The voices of Zane\u2019s family filtered through the dry evening air, but he had no urge to join them. He was feeling decidedly unsociable. He had a lingering headache he would almost have called a hangover, but it hadn\u2019t been nearly as fun to earn.</p><p>The sunset over the rolling Texas landscape was astonishing, though. Nothing like the rising sun burning away the mists on the mountaintops of West Virginia or the moon glowing down on the beaches near Kaneohe Bay in Hawaii, but still beautiful in its own way.</p><p>He\u2019d been to a lot of places in his life, places most men never got to see. Places most people had never even thought about. The dry tropics of Somalia. The jungles of Colombia. The hard rock mountains of Afghanistan and the desert of Kuwait. But he had rarely stopped to appreciate them until after the fact. It was hard to appreciate the beauty of a place when the scenery was being used to try to kill you.</p><p>The occasional roar of Barnum in the distance added a surreal feel to the whole thing. Ty smiled grimly. \u201cI hear you, buddy.\u201d</p><p>The cell phone in his pocket began to ring, startling him. He had yet to set his new phone to any of his usual rings, so he had no idea who it was or whether it was worth digging the phone out to answer.</p><p>He groaned and shifted forward as he struggled to pull his phone out of his jeans pocket. He couldn\u2019t get his cast past the denim, though, and he couldn\u2019t hold both the cigar and the glass in his broken hand to use the other one. Finally, he had to stand up, and by that time he was cursing and looking around for somewhere to put his drink down.</p><p>When he turned to glance behind him, he was surprised to find that he wasn\u2019t alone. Sadie stood there watching him, a doll in one hand and a smile on her face. Ty stared at her for a second and then handed her his wine glass. \u201cHold this.\u201d</p><p>She giggled and took the glass, clutching it and her doll to her chest with both hands as she watched him twist and struggle to fish his phone out of his pocket with his opposite hand.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t drink it, okay?\u201d She nodded.</p><p>When he got the phone out, he sat down and answered it with a distracted, \u201cGrady here.\u201d He reached for the glass, but when Sadie returned it, she also crawled into his lap and curled into the crook of his arm. He put his cigarillo out on the denim of his jeans and let it drop to the floor beside his chair so any lingering smoke wouldn\u2019t be near her.</p><p>\u201cTy,\u201d Dan McCoy said over the phone. \u201cI hear the fuck-up fairy has visited you two again.\u201d</p><p>Ty stared at the horizon as he tried to work out how to answer. There really wasn\u2019t a short version. Barnum roared somewhere in the hills. \u201cUh . . .\u201d</p><p>McCoy groaned as if he were in pain. \u201cWhat have you done now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. I just . . . nothing is really going to plan down here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou had a plan?\u201d McCoy asked in genuine shock.</p><p>Ty pursed his lips. \u201cNot really,\u201d he answered after a moment. \u201cBut if I had, I\u2019m pretty sure this is not the way it would have gone.\u201d</p><p>McCoy sighed. Ty could imagine him rubbing his forehead.</p><p>\u201cYou talked to Zane?\u201d Ty asked with an expectant wince.</p><p>\u201cHe called and said you\u2019d been tranquilized by exotic animal smugglers in Texas,\u201d McCoy said with an almost audible frown. \u201cI prefer when you lie to me, it\u2019s more of a challenge trying to decide if it\u2019s true. Garrett\u2019s not very good at it.\u201d</p><p>Ty laughed and closed his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re right, he\u2019s not. He\u2019s telling the truth, though.\u201d</p><p>McCoy was silent. \u201cWhy, Ty? Why do you do this to me? One day I\u2019m told you\u2019re being loaned out to Richard Burns, the next I hear you\u2019re playing footsy with Tony the Tiger in Texas to help out Garrett\u2019s family ranch!\u201d</p><p>Ty smiled and watched as Sadie\u2019s tiny fingers played with the broken pieces of plaster on his cast. \u201cMac. Do me a favor, okay?\u201d McCoy grunted, not willing to commit. \u201cTony the Tiger in Texas. Say it three times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it, Grady. Do you two need backup down there or is this just par for the course when you go off the grid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Zane handed it over to the locals this morning. Animal control is all over it, they\u2019ve got it under control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said you\u2019d been lying in a puddle of your own drool for almost a day, there was a tiger loose on his family\u2019s ranch, and no one has any idea who\u2019s behind it, how they\u2019re doing it, or what\u2019s going on.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s \u2018under control\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t judge me, Mac.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind sending in the cavalry down there if it\u2019ll hurry things along. I can make a call to the San Antonio division. Burns says I can\u2019t call you back unless Baltimore is burning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Baltimore burning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll talk to you after the Fourth, Mac. Have a good night.\u201d Ty hung up the phone with a grin. He slid it into his shirt pocket, thinking it would be easier to get it out next time, and tilted his head to look at Sadie.</p><p>Her eyelids were growing heavy as he rocked, her head resting on his shoulder as she stared at the setting sun. Ty drank down the last of his wine before putting his glass on the floor, then pulled her closer. He adjusted her until they could both be comfortable.</p> <p>\u201cDid you got eated by a tiger?\u201d she asked as she poked her finger into one of the tooth marks in his cast.</p><p>\u201cI guess I did. He was a good tiger, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he bite you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, a little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen he was a bad tiger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think so?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBiting is bad,\u201d Sadie said with a nod.</p><p>\u201cI guess you\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>She yawned, struggling to open her eyes again. \u201cWill the tiger bite me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sweet pea,\u201d Ty said. He rested his chin on her head.</p><p>\u201cDaddy will keep me safe.\u201d</p><p>Ty stared off into the sunset, pushing at the floorboards with his toes to keep the chair rocking. He nodded and pulled her closer, rocking and holding the little girl to him to keep her bare arms and legs warm as the night grew cooler. If his suspicions about Mark were correct, Sadie\u2019s daddy might not be around to keep her safe for a good long while.</p><p>\u201cHave you seen Sadie?\u201d Annie asked as she came into the den where Zane was sitting with his dad. \u201cWe can\u2019t find her anywhere.\u201d</p><p>Zane and Harrison stood to help look, Zane\u2019s mind going immediately to the tiger on the loose. He pushed back the instinctive panic and chastised himself. It was a valid concern that the tiger would be attracted to the activity of the ranch. They\u2019d been hearing his roars for two nights now. But Barnum was not going to start plucking the people Zane loved out of the house no matter how bad Zane\u2019s luck was.</p> <p>He found Ty and Sadie on the porch, and stopped short when he saw them. He hissed for Annie, who was walking through the foyer, and then moved closer.</p><p>Sadie was curled in Ty\u2019s arms, sleeping peacefully, her long lashes dark against her cheeks. Her fingers were tangled in his hair where she\u2019d been twirling it. She was tucked up under Ty\u2019s chin, and he was resting his head on top of hers. He was sound asleep too. Zane wasn\u2019t surprised; those tranquilizers would take a while to flush out of his system, and he\u2019d consumed a good deal of wine at dinner to combat the stress. Zane was surprised, however, to see his lover snuggled up with the little girl.</p><p>He smiled and leaned against the porch railing.</p><p>\u201cOh my goodness, that is precious. Where\u2019s my camera?\u201d Annie whispered. When she went to look for it, Zane took his phone out of his pocket and snapped a picture for himself. Whether he\u2019d use it as blackmail or frame it when they got home was up for debate. Maybe both.</p><p>One thing was for sure, though. After being in Texas with him, Zane could see Ty as part of his family, and more importantly, he\u2019d seen that most of his family would accept Ty for what he was: a quirky, brazen, possibly crazy, integral part of Zane\u2019s life. The idea of \u201cforever\u201d with Ty was becoming more and more certain.</p><p>Ty opened one eye and looked up at Zane.</p><p>\u201cTime to go,\u201d Zane whispered.</p><p>Ty moved his arms until he was cradling Sadie and stood up carefully. His wide shoulders made her look tiny, but he was just as gentle with her as Zane knew Ty was with all fragile things. Her hand fell out of his hair and dragged down his face, over his nose and lips, to tuck up under her chin with her other hand. Zane watched in silence, trying not to laugh as Ty merely closed his eyes and let it happen.</p><p>Ty handed Sadie off to her daddy a few minutes later, and they said good-bye to Mark and Annie as they headed upstairs to bed.</p><p>Harrison stood with them on the porch, then bid Ty and Zane a good night and turned to go inside.</p><p>\u201cSir, I\u2019m sorry for causing problems,\u201d Ty said. He sounded sincere, one of his rare apologies. Harrison stopped at the door and looked him up and down.</p><p>\u201cSon, there\u2019s not a problem here that\u2019s your fault.\u201d Harrison nodded to both of them and went back inside.</p><p>Ty could tell that something was weighing on Zane\u2019s mind as they headed to the guesthouse, but he waited for Zane to speak up.</p><p>Zane didn\u2019t. Ty lasted until after he\u2019d showered and they were both up in the loft bedroom, getting ready for bed, before he lost his patience.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s on your mind, darlin\u2019?\u201d he asked, drawling the affectionate name with a smirk because he knew that Zane loved to hear him say it.</p><p>Zane snorted and glanced at him as he folded the shirt he\u2019d been wearing. \u201cWhat makes you think something\u2019s on my mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re Zane Garrett. And Zane Garrett always has something on his mind.\u201d Ty stepped up to Zane and slid his hands onto his hips. Zane smiled at him, though Ty could tell he still wanted to talk about something. He didn\u2019t, though, just wrapped his arms around Ty\u2019s neck and started to move. It turned into a slow dance as Zane\u2019s smile grew wider, and Ty kissed him and slid his hands up Zane\u2019s back.</p><p>\u201cI was so damn worried about you,\u201d Zane said. \u201cI promised myself I\u2019d get a dance when you woke up.\u201d</p><p>Ty smiled and hugged him tighter. \u201cI\u2019ve decided if I can\u2019t get eaten by a tiger or killed by an animal tranquilizer, then I must be invincible.\u201d</p><p>Zane laughed and kissed him again before resting his chin on Ty\u2019s shoulder. \u201cTytanium.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHovercraft is full of eels, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re bullshitting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod\u2019s honest truth.\u201d</p><p>Ty\u2019s smile softened and he buried his nose in Zane\u2019s neck. \u201cYou know you can get a dance anytime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Zane whispered against his ear. \u201cI wish we could have done this at the bar.\u201d</p><p>Ty nodded, wondering if that was what Zane was thinking so hard over. He\u2019d been told how Beverly had reacted to Zane\u2019s news, but that she\u2019d later softened and helped Zane spend the night with him at the hospital. And though Ty was angry and frustrated over the lack of acceptance, he suspected there were added layers.</p><p>\u201cNext time we will, if you want to.\u201d</p><p>Zane hummed. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I might be embarrassed for everyone to see how bad a dancer you are.\u201d</p><p>Ty grunted and pushed his snickering lover away.</p><p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t be like that,\u201d Zane crooned as he reached for Ty again.</p><p>Ty turned Zane around in a simple box step to put him in front of the bed, then gave him a push to make him sit.</p><p>Zane huffed as he thumped down on the mattress. \u201cWhat do you know that I don\u2019t?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cSo much,\u201d Ty said with smirk as he sat beside Zane.</p><p>\u201cTy, come on. What did you find at the pump house? I know you were hiding something.\u201d</p><p>Ty nodded. \u201cWhy would Mark tell you about what happened at LeJeune when he did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that have to do with anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink, Zane. Why would he tell you something meant to make you suspicious of your partner right before we\u2019re riding out to look for evidence? It was a preemptive strike, like he was trying to give you a reason to doubt what I found when we got there.\u201d</p><p>Zane frowned harder. It was obvious that the thought hadn\u2019t crossed his mind.</p><p>\u201cWhy would he do that unless he was afraid of what I\u2019d find?\u201d</p><p>Zane shook his head. \u201cWhat did you find?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe ground was cold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was cold. The pebble I picked up, the ground under it. It was cool. There\u2019s something under there.\u201d</p><p>Zane stared at him, then stood up to pace. \u201cYou tried to tell me that at the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn Dari?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. We need to go back out there.\u201d</p><p>Ty waved at himself, looking offended. \u201cDoes this look like it\u2019s going on a horse again?\u201d</p><p>Zane stopped pacing and barked a laugh. He stalked closer and climbed into Ty\u2019s lap, brushing his nose against Ty\u2019s. \u201cMy apologies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know how you can make it up to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet you do.\u201d Zane pushed Ty onto his back. \u201cAnnie says you\u2019re handsome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course she does. Have you seen me?\u201d Ty grinned crookedly, laughed and put his hands behind his head, lounging under Zane.</p><p>\u201cYou were sweet tonight, with Sadie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s easy to be sweet with a cute kid in your lap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSadie\u2019s way too pretty for my peace of mind. I\u2019m glad I\u2019m not her daddy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe already knows how to wield the batting eyelashes. Teach her to handle a gun, give her a classic muscle car, she\u2019ll take over the world.\u201d</p><p>Zane chuckled. \u201cAt least you\u2019re true to type. If she\u2019s raised like I was, she\u2019ll have at least two guns before she\u2019s a teenager. More likely a truck than a muscle car, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShame.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy uncle taught me to shoot.\u201d</p><p>Ty ran his fingers down Zane\u2019s cheek. \u201cYou could teach her, you know.\u201d</p><p>Furrows appeared on Zane\u2019s brow. \u201cIf we end up putting her daddy in jail, there might be some strain there.\u201d</p><p>Ty nodded. He didn\u2019t like suspecting Mark any more than Zane did, but there was a lot that wasn\u2019t adding up.</p><p>\u201cRun it through for me, okay?\u201d</p><p>Ty nodded again. He held up his hand and pointed a finger to count. \u201cHe knew Stuart\u2019s name in the bar. He tried to throw you off the scent by telling you about LeJeune. He dogged my steps out there, tried to convince you and I to go after the tiger instead of the poachers, and he\u2019d have access to the kind of information and type of tranqs he needed through Annie\u2019s vet practice.\u201d</p><p>Zane looked at Ty\u2019s hand, now displaying all five fingers with the points he\u2019d listed. \u201cJesus, Ty,\u201d he said, and he ran his hand through his hair.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been wrong before.\u201d</p><p>Zane shook his head. \u201cHow are we going to explain to Sadie that her daddy\u2019s in jail because Uncle Z put him there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019d have you, Zane.\u201d</p><p>Zane met his eyes and took in a deep, shaky breath. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve never really been around kids. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d know what to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re just little people. They can be charmed like anyone else. Be a little silly, let them know what they\u2019re saying is the most important thing in the world, teach them right from wrong. You\u2019d be fine.\u201d</p><p>Zane met his eyes, thoughtful. \u201cYou like kids, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome of them, yeah,\u201d Ty answered with a shrug. \u201cI love the little ones, when they still look at the world with stars.\u201d</p><p>Zane smiled wistfully at the sentiment. \u201cI\u2019ve seen you with Elaina. And now with Sadie. She\u2019s an outgoing kid, but she took to you like glue. You\u2019re really good with them.\u201d</p><p>Ty just nodded, wondering why Zane was lingering over it.</p><p>Zane glanced away, then back to meet his eyes. \u201cDid you think about having kids?\u201d He paused a moment before adding, \u201cWith Ava?\u201d</p><p>Ty blinked at him. Ava Gaudet had been a near-miss of Ty\u2019s while undercover in New Orleans. Probably the last serious relationship he\u2019d had before Zane. He was glad Zane had asked, though. There was too much between them they still kept hidden, either on purpose or subconsciously. It was high time they started asking each other questions any normal couple would ask.</p><p>Ty nodded. \u201cShe wanted kids. Not when we were together, but eventually. It was never really an option for us, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you were still undercover. And hadn\u2019t told her about it.\u201d</p><p>Ty winced and looked past Zane\u2019s shoulder to the ceiling. \u201cThat didn\u2019t really factor in.\u201d</p><p>Zane frowned. \u201cI don\u2019t follow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I was younger, I took a bullet in the wrong place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there a right place to take a bullet?\u201d Zane asked with a smirk.</p><p>\u201cNo, but for the purposes of having kids, there is definitely a wrong one.\u201d Ty pulled the hem of his shirt up and pushed his pants down to show Zane a faded white scar, right at the juncture of his hip, that he knew Zane had seen before. Hell, Zane had licked it before. \u201cEven if I wanted kids . . .\u201d He shook his head and put his hands under his head again. \u201cThe doctor that did the surgery said nothing doing.\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s eyes widened before his expression settled into something sadder. \u201cTytanium,\u201d he whispered as he ran his fingertip across the scar. \u201cYou can\u2019t tell me that doesn\u2019t bother you.\u201d</p><p>Ty shrugged. \u201cIt did for a while, at first. I mean hell, I was twenty-two. But I never lived the life of someone who could be a good daddy. It was never in my cards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess that\u2019s true,\u201d Zane said before turning his gaze toward the windows.</p><p>\u201cTell me what you\u2019re thinking, Zane.\u201d</p><p>Zane inhaled deeply and let it out in a soft sigh. \u201cBecky and I never talked about having kids,\u201d he said. \u201cNot real seriously. We were both working a lot. I was a rising star, she was doing charity work.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDid you want them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I was just thinking about. I don\u2019t know. We never really did see ourselves as parents.\u201d He shrugged and met Ty\u2019s eyes. \u201cAnd then she was gone, and I didn\u2019t have any reason to think about it anymore.\u201d</p><p>Ty pursed his lips and laid his hand across Zane\u2019s where it rested on his chest.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019d make a great dad, you know,\u201d Zane said, his voice quiet and melancholy. Ty glanced up, eyebrows climbing high. \u201cI think I\u2019d almost like to see it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you saying you might want kids one day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Tonight was literally the first time I truly thought I might.\u201d</p><p>Ty gaped, at a loss for words. Was this what Zane had been thinking about all night?</p><p>Zane remained quiet, watching him for several breaths before echoing, \u201cTell me what you\u2019re thinking, Ty.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUh . . . I\u2019m thinking . . . I love you. And I\u2019m glad things didn\u2019t go to plan when we were both younger.\u201d</p><p>Zane slid his fingertips across Ty\u2019s lips. With a blink, his expression changed, and he was gazing at Ty with such longing and love that he might as well have screamed it at the top of his lungs. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t change it,\u201d he rasped. \u201cAny of it.\u201d</p><p>He leaned his hands on both of Ty\u2019s shoulders, right on top of the cougar scars, and bent down to kiss him.</p><p>Ty hummed and let the warmth of Zane\u2019s demanding hands spread through him. Zane\u2019s lips gave against his. He moved one hand to tug Ty\u2019s T-shirt up, and then slid it under to smooth across Ty\u2019s side and lower back. Ty winced when Zane\u2019s fingers dragged over the scrapes and bruises he\u2019d earned from being keelhauled by a goddamned tiger, but it didn\u2019t stop him from grabbing a handful of Zane\u2019s hair as they kissed.</p><p>Ty smiled against his lips. Zane hadn\u2019t finished changing yet, and Ty let his fingers dig into and linger over Zane\u2019s bare skin. He ran his hands down Zane\u2019s sides, irritated that the cast was getting in his way. It also had sharp pieces now, both from where the knife had gone through it and the tooth marks.</p><p>For the first time, they were actually discussing their future in concrete terms. They\u2019d both known, on some level, that they intended to spend the rest of their lives together. It felt like a solid force now, though, something as real as the hands that pressed into his back or the lips that met his over and over as they made love.</p> <p>Chapter 9</p><p>\u201cI think we need to go to San Antonio,\u201d Zane said. They were sitting at the little breakfast table in the guesthouse, eating cereal and watching the sunrise through the bank of windows.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can drop in on the field office, see if we can put a bug in someone\u2019s ear.\u201d</p><p>Ty stared at him, chewing his Rice Krispies.</p><p>Zane shifted under Ty\u2019s attention. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Ty waved his spoon through the air. \u201cGo on.\u201d</p><p>Zane rolled his eyes and sighed. \u201cOkay, fine. I want to take a page out of your book and use us as bait. See if anyone follows. And I figured you\u2019d go nuts over the Alamo and I wanted to walk down the Riverwalk with you. We could spend a night there, maybe. Enjoy Texas a little before Mother\u2019s big party on Sunday.\u201d</p> <p>They\u2019d be heading home after the Fourth of July. They\u2019d done all they could here without stepping on jurisdictional toes, and though there were still poachers out there, and Ty\u2019s tiger was still on the loose, they did have jobs back in Baltimore to get to. It just wasn\u2019t their case to work. Zane thought a side trip to San Antonio before they left was well-deserved after what they\u2019d been through.</p><p>\u201cSo? What do you think?\u201d</p><p>Ty smiled, one of his rare smiles that showed his dimples. They drove Zane crazy. \u201cI\u2019d like that,\u201d Ty drawled in a way that sent shivers up Zane\u2019s spine.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll head up to the house, let Dad know what we\u2019re doing, and then we can head down there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long\u2019s the drive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn hour or two, depending on traffic and the shape of the back roads.\u201d</p><p>Ty nodded, looking down at his cereal bowl. Zane had lived for his job for so long it was odd to think he might want something different, but he could imagine that, in ten or twenty years, they\u2019d be able to do this every morning. Get up late, fix breakfast together, and plan their day as they ate. The thought of retirement came to him more often now.</p><p>What he\u2019d said to his family at dinner the other night was true. The thought of asking Ty to marry him was appealing. There were obvious problems, first and foremost being that they\u2019d have to go to another state or country to do it. But the more Zane thought of it, the more he liked the idea. He knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that he\u2019d spend the rest of his life with Ty. And after last night, he could even picture himself and Ty with kids. Not soon, because he wanted Ty to himself for a while. But it was something solid in their future.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re thinking kind of hard,\u201d Ty said. He sat back and cocked his head.</p><p>Zane took in a deep breath. He didn\u2019t want to tell Ty what he was thinking; he wanted it to be a complete surprise when he finally did it. Ty narrowed his eyes, but Zane gave him an enigmatic grin and stood to tidy the dishes.</p><p>\u201cFine, keep your mysteries, Garrett. They make you fun.\u201d</p><p>Zane laughed. That pretty much summed up how Ty saw life. He glanced over his shoulder. \u201cThis party is going to be a bitch, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can always abscond in the night.\u201d</p><p>Zane pointed at Ty. \u201cYou get to face Mother after that, buddy boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee, we need to go over your definition of abscond.\u201d</p><p>Zane turned and threw the dishrag at Ty\u2019s head. They both laughed. \u201cGo pack and we\u2019ll head on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love it when you get all bossy,\u201d Ty said with relish as he headed for the stairs.</p><p>He sauntered away. He was barefoot, had no shirt on, and his sweatpants were barely staying on his hips. How could he be so damn sexy and in such a good mood after almost getting eaten by a tiger and being in a tranquilizer-induced coma for a day? Zane couldn\u2019t help himself; he called out, \u201cHey, Ty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my darling?\u201d Ty responded sarcastically from halfway up the staircase.</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>Ty grinned and started up the steps again. \u201cI like what Texas does to you, Zane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care what you say, Harrison, or what he says, that man is taking advantage of our son and I will not stand for it!\u201d</p><p>Harrison sat in his recliner with yesterday\u2019s newspaper in his lap, unread. He was massaging the bridge of his nose and seriously considering taking a few of the painkillers the doctor had given him for his shoulder, just so he could have an excuse to go hide on his porch. Anything to get away from his wife. Their marriage had never been about love. It had all but been arranged for them, to solidify the wealth of the two families. When it had turned from convenient to intolerable, he couldn\u2019t quite identify.</p><p>Harrison just wanted to do good by his horses and his family, and he was a happy man. But Beverly had always been driven by power, money, and status. At one time he\u2019d seen vestiges of that same drive in his son, and he\u2019d resigned himself to never being able to understand either of them. But something had reached inside Zane, something had changed him, and Harrison was damn sure that something had involved Ty.</p><p>\u201cBeverly, Zane is his own man, and he\u2019s a smart one at that. And if you\u2019d take a minute to get to know Ty, you\u2019d find that he\u2019s a good man too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you approve of them? Does it not bother you that your son, your only son, the very last male to carry the Garrett name, goes home from work every night to another man? That doesn\u2019t offend your sensibilities?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot one bit,\u201d Harrison said. He picked up his newspaper again. \u201cAt least he looks forward to going home.\u201d</p><p>She grabbed the top of his newspaper and yanked it down. Her eyes were flashing and her nostrils flared.</p><p>\u201cMind your blood pressure, Beverly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if they go off and get married? You know they allow that in some states? That . . . that hooligan could be entitled to half the estate!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t take it with you. What do you care? As I see it, they\u2019re happy. Zane has every right to be happy, and I for one would rather see him more than once a year. If welcoming Ty into the family with open arms is what it takes, then I find that quite agreeable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe will never be part of my family, Harrison. I won\u2019t allow it. He can stay here and fight the good fight all he wants, but I won\u2019t allow my only son to be brainwashed like this.\u201d</p><p>Harrison scratched at his chin, pursing his lips thoughtfully. \u201cIf that\u2019s the way you want it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt most certainly is,\u201d Beverly snarled. She spun on her heel and stomped off.</p><p>Harrison pursed his lips and finally nodded. \u201cWhat do you think, Bullet?\u201d he grumbled to the Australian Shepherd at his feet. \u201cThink you can dig us a hole deep enough nobody\u2019d find her?\u201d</p><p>The dog answered with a wiggle of its docked tail. Harrison grinned and rubbed the dog\u2019s head.</p><p>There was a knock on the doorframe, and Zane stepped into the room, smirking. Harrison put his paper aside.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get up,\u201d Zane said quickly. \u201cWe\u2019re not staying long.\u201d</p><p>Ty leaned against the doorframe and didn\u2019t come farther. He was wearing a pair of aviator sunglasses, and the way he held himself made it look like he was being careful with how he moved.</p><p>\u201cMorning, Ty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood morning, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow you feeling?\u201d Harrison asked as he eased back down.</p><p>\u201cStill a little hungover, to be honest.\u201d</p><p>Harrison laughed and nodded. \u201cAnd sore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you two up to today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I just figured I\u2019d show Ty some more of Texas. Head down to San Antonio and visit the Bureau office there,\u201d Zane said. He shot a sideways look at Ty. \u201cMaybe spend a night in Beaumont.\u201d</p><p>Ty smacked his forehead and turned his head away.</p><p>\u201cNot much in Beaumont to see,\u201d Harrison said with a frown.</p><p>Zane grinned. \u201cEven so, we\u2019re going to try to get it in.\u201d</p><p>Ty had his hand over his mouth, his head down. He was either going to throw up or he was laughing. Harrison felt he\u2019d missed a joke, but he thought maybe he didn\u2019t want to know.</p><p>\u201cYou planning to miss the barbeque?\u201d he asked Zane.</p><p>\u201cNo, sir. We\u2019ll be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what you\u2019re doing, Z. It ain\u2019t a good idea.\u201d</p><p>Zane just raised an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cYou two are traipsing down to San Antonio seeing if anything comes out of the woodwork to follow.\u201d</p><p>Zane just laughed. \u201cIt kind of crossed my mind. Spread the word around that we\u2019re leaving, huh? Call me if anything happens.\u201d</p><p>Harrison nodded. \u201cYou boys have fun.\u201d</p><p>Ty smacked Zane in the arm as they walked out of sight, Zane\u2019s laughter echoing off the marble hall in the foyer.</p><p>Harrison nodded. It was soothing to his soul to see his son happy again, and to know that he might come back more often now that he\u2019d gotten so much off his chest.</p><p>If Beverly wouldn\u2019t allow Ty to be part of her family, then she might just need to find herself a new one.</p><p>They checked into the Hyatt on the Riverwalk in San Antonio. Ty realized that he had revealed one of his hidden passions to Zane, and Zane was exploiting his love of history for everything he was worth. Just like the battlefield at Gettysburg months ago, Ty went completely crazy over the Alamo.</p><p>They spent a solid hour exploring the tiny footprint of the famous mission, and then they strolled along the Riverwalk hand-in-hand. They finished their foray with a candlelit dinner, and as Ty gazed across the flickering flame at his lover, he could tell there was something Zane wanted to say. It was almost fun to watch him try to work up to it and then chicken out and back down. Ty was curious, but he\u2019d found that sometimes it was better to let Zane make his own way though his mind. How long would it take him to finally get it out?</p><p>Dinner ended with Zane in an atrociously good mood and Ty just buzzed enough to be malleable as they wove through a celebratory crowd on the edges of the Alamo. Zane had Ty\u2019s hand in his, leading him somewhere. They found their way into the Alamo Gardens amidst a few dozen other people. The crowd had a feeling to it, like everyone was waiting for something to begin.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>Zane gave a shrug, but turned to look back at Ty with a half-smirk. Ty narrowed his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI know a good spot,\u201d Zane told him.</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not triggered by fireworks, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFireworks. Do they . . . trigger flashbacks or anything?\u201d</p><p>Ty shrugged. \u201cOnly happened once. It was right after I got home, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Zane\u2019s hand tightened in Ty\u2019s and Ty had to laugh as he dodged a low-lying oak branch and tramped along in the moonlight and flickering light of the lanterns that lined the Alamo. It wasn\u2019t hard to see, but it was hard to keep up with Zane and his excitement.</p><p>Ty couldn\u2019t help but smile as Zane led him toward the massive, sprawling oak tree that stood as the centerpiece of the gardens. Ty had marveled at it when they\u2019d visited earlier. They passed by it, heading for another of the trees near the perimeter of the walled courtyard. A low branch hung out over the grass, and beneath it, a blanket had been laid out.</p><p>\u201cYou sneaky bastard,\u201d Ty said as Zane laughed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIf you tip high enough, the concierge will do just about anything for you. I figured we could watch the fireworks from here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you go for romantic, you go all out, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly way to go.\u201d Zane knelt and crawled onto the blanket, straightened the edges out where they\u2019d blown over, then turned around, still on one knee, and held his hand out. Ty took it, meeting Zane\u2019s eyes in the flickering light. Zane hesitated, looking up at him with brown eyes that seemed to have gone liquid in the low light. Time seemed to slow.</p> <p>Ty found himself short of breath, and he had no idea why.</p><p>Zane bent his head to kiss Ty\u2019s fingers, breaking the little spell he\u2019d cast, and then he tugged Ty down to join him on the blanket.</p><p>They stretched out on their backs, looking up at the velvet sky and holding hands.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Ty,\u201d Zane whispered.</p><p>Ty turned his head to look at Zane\u2019s profile. \u201cFor what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEverything.\u201d</p><p>Zane pushed up onto his side. His face was shadowed, but Ty knew every inch of it by heart. He saw those eyes in his sleep. He reached to slide the tips of his fingers against Zane\u2019s lips, and Zane bent to kiss him, his hands tucking under Ty\u2019s body.</p><p>The first pop of pre-emptive Fourth of July fireworks over the Alamo made them both jump, and Zane turned so they could watch the fire rain down from the sky through the branches of their oak tree. Another shot soared into the air, bursting into flickering flames of red, white, and blue. People began to hoot and holler. No one was paying them any attention.</p><p>Zane looked down at Ty, and Ty grinned. This was nothing special for Ty. In his world, every time Zane\u2019s lips touched his, something somewhere caught fire.</p><p>Zane rolled onto his back again, resting his head on Ty\u2019s stomach as they watched the show. It was impressive and loud, with each burst of color and flame followed by whoops and shouts from the people gathered around the Alamo and in the streets of San Antonio.</p><p>Ty carded his fingers through Zane\u2019s hair. The moment felt heavy. As if it were fated for something of great importance, like there was something they should have been doing but weren\u2019t. It wasn\u2019t necessarily a bad feeling, just something they were letting pass them by.</p> <p>\u201cTy?\u201d Zane said after the last of the fireworks had faded into trails of smoke in the sky.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you be willing to come back here with me? To the ranch, I mean, if we came back for Thanksgiving, or . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d go anywhere you wanted me to.\u201d</p><p>Zane sat up and turned until he was resting on his elbows and looking down at Ty. \u201cWill you tell me something if I ask?\u201d</p><p>Ty frowned at the odd way the question was posed. He had a feeling he knew where Zane was going, and though it made him uncomfortable and tense, he nodded.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to you in the Marines?\u201d</p><p>Ty\u2019s stomach flip-flopped and he swallowed hard. It was a question Zane had every right to ask, and it was one Ty had hoped he never would.</p> <p>Ty licked his lips, his mind racing. \u201cI can\u2019t . . . I can\u2019t tell you all of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat can you tell me?\u201d</p><p>Ty swallowed hard, hesitating as he stared into Zane\u2019s eyes. \u201cI . . . I was taken prisoner on a Recon mission in Afghanistan. The op is still classified and we were never officially prisoners of war. But I guess it\u2019s something you should know. Classified or not.\u201d</p><p>Zane nodded and took one of Ty\u2019s hands. \u201cYou and Nick, right?\u201d</p><p>Ty stared at him, mouth hanging open. \u201cYou\u2019re not surprised. Do I hide it that poorly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But I\u2019d suspected that before. I overheard you and Nick talking when he came to visit that first time. I\u2019ve been sleeping with you for the better part of a year. You speak in Farsi. I try to wake you when the dreams are the worst.\u201d</p><p>Ty nodded. They both had nightmares. It wasn\u2019t something they discussed often.</p><p>Zane finally glanced up to meet Ty\u2019s eyes. \u201cAnd then Nick told me, when we were on his boat.\u201d</p><p>Ty\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cHe told you?\u201d</p><p>Zane nodded, wincing.</p><p>\u201cHow much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll of it.\u201d</p><p>Ty reached up and put a hand over his mouth, feeling sick.</p><p>\u201cTy?\u201d Zane whispered. He ran his hand over Ty\u2019s face.</p><p>Ty had to try twice before he got the words out. \u201cI\u2019ve just never dealt with anyone knowing about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Ty shook his head, trying to shrug it off. \u201cYou should know. You should know all of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you tell me?\u201d</p><p>Ty peered deep into the sincerity and worry, the love and devotion shining in Zane\u2019s eyes. \u201cYeah. I can\u2019t . . . I\u2019ll tell you more than I should.\u201d</p><p>Zane smiled a smile so brilliant it rivaled the fireworks. Ty slid his hand over Zane\u2019s chest and up his shoulders. Then his fingers were dragging over Zane\u2019s neck, his thumb digging in near Zane\u2019s ear as he pulled him closer and kissed him.</p><p>Zane scooted over to rest half on top of him, and Ty lifted a knee to let Zane settle between his legs. The longer they kissed, the less urgent the past seemed.</p><p>Zane finally pulled back with a low growl. \u201cDo you feel lucky enough to be fucked in a National Landmark without getting arrested?\u201d</p><p>Ty barked a laugh. \u201cYou\u2019ve lost your damn mind.\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s head felt heavy as he and Ty tromped up the front steps. They\u2019d spent a solid two days traipsing across Texas, and the only attention they\u2019d attracted was from an overly flirtatious denizen of San Antonio who Ty had almost decked before Zane could drag him away.</p><p>They were home with just hours to spare, and Zane\u2019s mother had requested his presence, citing something of great importance she wanted to discuss before the Steers and Stripes Barbeque began.</p><p>\u201cAny ideas?\u201d Ty asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, but I am ever the optimist,\u201d Zane grumbled as he led the way into the big house. They could hear the others in the kitchen, gathering supplies and making preparations. \u201cGo ahead. I\u2019ll see what Mother wants and be there in a bit.\u201d</p><p>Ty nodded distractedly as he took his gun and checked it. It\u2019d become a habit of his every time he entered or exited the house, and like every new quirk Zane noticed Ty developing, it fascinated him. He turned to head for the drawing room, but he stopped in the doorway and peered in before entering.</p><p>Beverly was sitting at her desk, papers spread out around her.</p><p>Zane walked into the richly decorated room. \u201cYou wanted to see me, Mother?\u201d</p><p>Beverly looked up, surprised. Zane glanced around the room, the same sense of foreboding assaulting him as when he\u2019d been little and gotten in trouble. This time, it seemed, Beverly was nervous too.</p><p>She offered him a weak smile and stood. She was dressed in one of her pristine white suits and had her hair pulled back in a chignon. Surprisingly, a few red and blue ribbons were woven into her hair, a delicate touch of whimsy for the party on an otherwise staid and severe visage.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been having a crisis of conscience, Zane.\u201d</p><p>Only Zane\u2019s years of practice at hiding his emotions let him cover any outward reaction. Inside, he went cold. He\u2019d gotten that ability from his mother.</p><p>He knew what this was about, and he prayed he\u2019d misjudged her. He swallowed hard. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my only son, Zane, and I have loved you in the only way I know how. I have tried to hold my tongue when you made your decisions. I prayed that you would come home to us, in one piece, and find solace in your family. But I\u2019ve seen these past days that you\u2019ve chosen to get your comfort elsewhere. And it is one place I cannot in good conscience allow you to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother,\u201d Zane said, surprised when his voice came out hoarse and tight.</p><p>\u201cYou are the last Garrett in a long line, Zane. This family needs you in more ways than you can imagine.\u201d</p><p>Her words were like ice, biting and sharp, and each one cut Zane deeper. How could she not care one iota that he was happy now? He tried to stay calm as he spoke. \u201cMother, we\u2019ve beaten this horse to rawhide. I\u2019m not coming back to Texas, much less to anything else you seem to think is my duty. I certainly won\u2019t marry some woman I don\u2019t love just to produce another generation of miserable Garretts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou seem to have no problem flaunting your . . . your what? Friend? I don\u2019t even know what to call him,\u201d Beverly said, her lips twisted into an ugly frown as she stalked around her desk.</p><p>\u201cHis name is Ty. You can call him my partner. Or my boyfriend. How about prospective son-in-law?\u201d</p><p>\u201cZane Zachary Garrett!\u201d Beverly slapped her hand on the desktop, cheeks flushing. \u201cI will not stand for it! I will not ruin this family\u2019s name by having a son who thinks he\u2019s gay simply because he\u2019s got an easy screw on hand!\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s eyes widened, and the anger he\u2019d been trying to hold back broke free. \u201cYou are totally out of line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs are you,\u201d Beverly snapped. \u201cHe is after your money, pure and simple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t even know him. You\u2019ve said all of three words to him, all of them cruel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know his type, and they\u2019re all the same no matter what parts they have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guarantee you\u2019ve never met his type before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cZane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love him, Mother. And he loves me. It has nothing to do with money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he tell you he loved you before or after you mentioned your family was wealthy?\u201d</p><p>Her proposition was patently ridiculous, but his analytical mind was forced to stop and a take a moment to consider the answer anyway. It had been after, in fact, but it didn\u2019t matter.</p><p>His pause made Beverly close her eyes and sigh deeply. She seemed truly tortured by the revelation, and for a brief moment her defenses dropped and Zane could see the war behind her mask. She was torn between love of her son and prejudices and preconceptions she had held all her life.</p><p>Zane stepped forward, desperate to use that torment to his advantage. \u201cMother. Please, just give him a chance. You said you have only one son, but you could have two if you\u2019d just see him for what he is.\u201d</p><p>She pressed her lips into a thin line, fighting not to show any more emotion than she had. She knew it was a weakness Zane would exploit, and she made an effort to bury it away again, right in front of his eyes.</p><p>Zane understood suddenly, the realization hitting him like a blast of cold water, what Ty had seen him do so many times.</p><p>He was stunned into silence by how badly it hurt.</p><p>Beverly took a deep breath. She put her hand on his chest, and when she spoke, her voice wavered. \u201cHave I ever told you how proud I am of you?\u201d</p><p>The pain dug deep inside him, and Zane had to choke on a breath to fight back tears. \u201cNo, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>She pursed her trembling lips and gave a jerky nod. A tear broke free as she stepped closer and hugged him. Her head barely came to his chest. Zane realized he was crying as he hugged her. She felt old and fragile, so very fragile in his hands.</p><p>She pushed away and turned, wiping her eyes as she paced away. \u201cI simply can\u2019t, Zane,\u201d she said, her voice ragged but gaining conviction. She shook her head. \u201cYou can\u2019t have it both ways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth ways?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can have your family, Zane. Or you can have him.\u201d</p><p>Zane took a step back before he realized he\u2019d given ground. While they had always argued over these things, never had his mother been so cold, so ruthless, and he couldn\u2019t even absorb it as he stared at her. His stomach was roiling.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cZane,\u201d she said with an almost-sympathetic tilt of her head. \u201cIt\u2019s my job to protect this family at all costs. You\u2019re my son. But you\u2019re also a drunk and an addict, you\u2019ve got a worthless job with no future, and you\u2019re a widower who\u2019s taken up with another man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not interested in you, Zane, merely your family\u2019s fortune. Can\u2019t you see that? He\u2019s no more than a whore who works on credit!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s too far,\u201d Zane whispered.</p><p>\u201cI will not have you running off and marrying that man to give him access to the family\u2019s money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you choose him, I will draw up a statement of disavowment, Zane.\u201d Her voice was shaking, but she clearly meant it. \u201cYou will be cut off from the family\u2019s fortune to protect it.\u201d</p><p>Zane thought he might throw up right there on the carpet. She actually believed this would put him in his place.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really very simple,\u201d Beverly said. She took a step toward him and put her hands on his arm. \u201cYou don\u2019t even have to go back to Baltimore. All you have to do is call in to start the retirement paperwork. We love you, Zane. You need to be at home.\u201d</p><p>The bile rising in his throat kept him from answering. There was roaring in his ears, and he wanted to roar along with it and rail at her, but he couldn\u2019t find the words. She\u2019d never had a chance, despite what she thought.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re talking about my partner. The man I love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cZane. Blood is thicker than water.\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s body went cold. \u201cMother, he\u2019s shed more blood for me than you ever will.\u201d</p><p>He turned and headed for the door.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not bluffing, Zane!\u201d she called after him. \u201cAt least think about it!\u201d</p><p>Zane rushed out of the house, blinded by rage so intense he thought he might injure himself if he didn\u2019t dispel it somehow. He shoved the front door open and began to pace on the front porch, dragging his hand through his hair. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The floorboards creaked behind him and he whirled to give his mother another piece of his mind. He drew up short when he found Ty standing there.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Ty asked, his voice gentle.</p><p>Zane struggled for a breath and realized he was about to start hyperventilating. He was definitely not okay.</p> <p>The next thing he knew, Ty was beside him and pulling him into a tight embrace. He squeezed his eyes shut and clutched at Ty\u2019s shirt, hurting so much he couldn\u2019t imagine standing at all if it weren\u2019t for Ty holding him up. Ty\u2019s hand came to rest on the back of Zane\u2019s head.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d he whispered. \u201cBreathe.\u201d</p><p>Zane was shaking, falling apart. His own mother. \u201cTy, she\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I heard.\u201d The anger in Ty\u2019s voice was masked by layers of warmth and support as he murmured into Zane\u2019s ear. \u201cFamily ain\u2019t all about blood, Zane. It\u2019ll be okay.\u201d</p><p>The soft West Virginia twang was more comforting than Zane would have expected, but he still buried his face in the crook of Ty\u2019s neck. He just needed another minute to let the pain peak. He could understand why she didn\u2019t like that he was with Ty. Prejudices ran deep, as did the desire to continue the Garrett name, and to Beverly Carter-Garrett, appearances were everything. But couldn\u2019t she just be pleased to have him happy, like a real mother? Why the hell couldn\u2019t she give Ty a chance?</p> <p>Zane gritted his teeth and tried to get himself under control. The tears weren\u2019t cooperating.</p><p>Ty stood and held him close for long minutes, long enough for Zane to pull himself together. He took a deep breath and stepped back.</p><p>Ty took his face in both hands and looked him in the eyes. \u201cFeel better?\u201d</p><p>Zane nodded and covered Ty\u2019s hands with his own. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>Ty\u2019s rough palm brushed over his cheek. \u201cShe\u2019s lashing out the only way she knows how. Give it time.\u201d</p><p>Zane closed his eyes as he pressed his cheek against Ty\u2019s hand. \u201cI\u2019ve given it more than forty years,\u201d he said, and it came out more harshly than he\u2019d planned. \u201cI\u2019m not giving it any more. I hope you\u2019re not too fond of Texas. I think I\u2019d rather steer clear for a while.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSteer clear?\u201d Ty asked drily. \u201cIs that a cow joke?\u201d</p><p>Zane choked on a laugh and whacked his knuckles against Ty\u2019s chest. Ty reached out and hugged him again, and Zane held him close, thanking God that he\u2019d found him. It didn\u2019t matter what happened or what they went through, Ty always seemed to know how to make it better.</p><p>Zane frowned as he twisted a pink balloon around and around, forming it into what would ultimately look like a wiener dog with a huge nose. He tied off the last twist and held it up for Sadie.</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t look like a pony, Uncle Z,\u201d she said, scowling.</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s pink.\u201d</p><p>She narrowed her eyes, and after a long moment she petted his knee with a sigh. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. You\u2019ll do better next time.\u201d Then she snatched the wiener pony out of his hand and went running.</p><p>Zane coughed against a laugh and glanced across the table at the others. Annie and Mark were laughing, their eyes on Sadie as she caroused. Zane\u2019s gaze fell upon Ty. He was lounging and hiding a smile behind his hand, watching Zane.</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Zane grumbled, but he couldn\u2019t take his eyes off Ty.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou try it next time.\u201d</p><p>Ty chuckled and winked at him. He\u2019d already regaled a group of the younger kids with magic, making a coin disappear and then pulling it out of Sadie\u2019s ear, amongst other tricks. The only thing Zane could do that didn\u2019t involve a knife was make a balloon animal. He\u2019d made swords or those nebulous four-legged animals for each child. Now they were all swashbuckling and pretending to be tigers with their balloons.</p><p>There was a loud pop from somewhere nearby, and Zane cleared his throat and shifted in his chair, hoping no one had noticed him staring at his lover. No one was paying any attention to him, though.</p><p>The annual Carter Garrett Steers and Stripes Barbeque was in full swing.</p><p>Hundreds of people were in attendance, laughing, dancing, eating, and drinking. Kids roamed the crowd in packs. The sheriff and his men were here, as were several animal control officers.</p><p>Amidst the festivities was an undercurrent of tension. Barnum the Bengal tiger was still out there somewhere, and there was a high possibility he\u2019d fixated on Ty\u2019s scent as something familiar. The poachers were still free and running around, probably even at the party. And the news of Beverly\u2019s ultimatum had spread through the family, the ranch hands, and the guests. Soon it would be all the way to Austin, and that seemed to be the biggest news of all. Zane was surprised to find that while some seemed to approve of Beverly\u2019s \u201ctough love\u201d approach, most were appalled. She was being snubbed by a few individuals that shocked even Zane. But then, so was he.</p><p>\u201cDonations for the trick shooting contest are about to close, ladies and gentlemen,\u201d Harrison called out from the flatbed trailer they\u2019d turned into a flag-festooned stage. \u201cAll proceeds this year will be donated to local animal shelters and the Roaring Springs Big Cat Sanctuary. You can sponsor a shooter for two hundred dollars. Let\u2019s have a few more contestants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou two ought to shoot, Z,\u201d Annie said, looking across the round table at Ty and Zane.</p><p>Mark narrowed his eyes at Ty. \u201cI suppose Grady would give a good showing. From what I remember, you were pretty good at the competitions.\u201d</p><p>Ty shrugged, a mixture of humility and nonchalance. Zane was still trying to shake the nagging feeling that they would be putting Mark in handcuffs soon. With that and the ultimatum from his mother, he was having a hard time concentrating on what was going on around them.</p><p>He tore his eyes away from Ty and adjusted his hat.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think, Ty?\u201d Annie asked. \u201cAre you two good enough to compete?\u201d</p><p>Zane tried not to smile too much as he glanced at his partner. They had no idea what he and Ty were capable of. Zane almost wanted to see Ty show them all what he could do.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, we do okay,\u201d Ty answered with a careless shrug. He took another drink of his beer, then glanced over at the large area they\u2019d cleared for the shooting gallery. \u201cTrick shots don\u2019t usually have much to do with how good a shot you are.\u201d</p><p>Marissa leaned forward. She was sitting on Cody\u2019s lap, and they\u2019d been whispering and flirting for most of the day. \u201cWhy do you say that? I\u2019ve been watching this stuff all my life, and it\u2019s always the best shots who win.\u201d</p><p>Ty shook his head. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t just take shooting straight. It takes practice. It\u2019s kind of like playing mini golf; they\u2019re more like puzzles than pure tests of ability. Same guy who can hit a moving target at a hundred yards can\u2019t always hit a penny on a fence post with a mirror. And a dude who can shoot the fluffy part off a toothpick at thirty yards while he\u2019s hanging upside down by his balls might not hit a moving truck if it was trying to run him over.\u201d</p><p>That drew a round of laughs, and Zane shook his head as he drank from his water bottle. It was hot, hotter than he remembered from his youth. He could feel the sweat making its way through his shirt. Ty had one of his Buffs around his forehead, sitting under his hat, and another around his wrist that he used periodically to wipe the sweat away from anywhere that needed. Zane imagined it was a system he\u2019d created while in the Corps.</p><p>\u201cYou get a lot of target practice working for the FBI?\u201d Cody asked. \u201cI didn\u2019t even think to ask if you carry normally or if it\u2019s just been since you came to Texas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly target practice,\u201d Zane said under his breath. He ran his water bottle over his forehead.</p><p>Ty shot him a grin and emptied his beer. \u201cNothing too exciting,\u201d he answered, tongue-in-cheek. \u201cBut yeah, we carry all the time.\u201d</p><p>Cody nodded.</p><p>\u201cI think you should enter, Z. Someone from the family should,\u201d Annie said.</p><p>\u201cSince when is Mark not family?\u201d Zane asked.</p><p>\u201cJackass,\u201d Mark said with a snort. \u201cYou know she means a blood relative.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to talk to Mother about that,\u201d Zane said, trying not to sound bitter and failing.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Zane,\u201d Annie whispered. Zane shrugged.</p><p>\u201cHow about it, Grady?\u201d Mark said. \u201cWe\u2019ll all enter, see who\u2019s held onto their skills.\u201d</p><p>Zane glanced between them, not sure why Mark would warn him about Ty being unstable and dangerous and then try to get Ty to enter a shooting contest. Perhaps it was just a little too much testosterone for his brother-in-law to handle. Or maybe Mark was trying to find a reason to have a loaded gun pointed at Ty\u2019s head.</p><p>Ty glanced at Zane and gave a lazy shrug. \u201cI got three beers in me, no way I should be trick shooting.\u201d</p><p>Mark laughed and threw back the rest of his beer.</p><p>The sheriff walked up to their table as they talked, tipping his hat when they all looked at him.</p><p>\u201cSheriff Barnes,\u201d Zane with a smile. \u201cAny news for us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome,\u201d the man said, as unflappable and unreadable as ever. \u201cWe found the vet practice the tranquilizers were stolen from.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great!\u201d Annie said. She sat forward in her chair.</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am. Unfortunately, it was yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Her smile morphed into a horrified gape.</p><p>Zane glanced at his sister, then he met Ty\u2019s eyes. Ty was looking at the table, probably trying to observe Mark\u2019s reaction without being noticed. There was another point against him.</p><p>\u201cI reported it missing the other night when I was taking stock of everything,\u201d Marissa admitted, looking mortified.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d Annie asked.</p><p>\u201cI thought it was drug seekers, not tiger poachers!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll flag \u2019em down,\u201d the sheriff said. He tipped his hat. \u201cY\u2019all enjoy the party.\u201d</p><p>He sauntered away, leaving a pall over their little gathering.</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d Annie finally asked.</p><p>Ty and Zane shared a look, but neither was willing to answer.</p><p>\u201cOh no,\u201d Annie said.</p><p>Zane glanced up, but Annie was peering past his shoulder at someone else approaching. Zane turned to find Stuart walking toward them.</p><p>\u201cGarrett,\u201d Stuart said. He touched the brim of his hat with a finger and Zane stood to meet him. \u201cI come to apologize to you and . . . your friend.\u201d</p><p>Zane couldn\u2019t help it when his eyebrows climbed high.</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s . . . decent of you,\u201d Zane said.</p><p>Stuart held out his hand, but Zane hesitated before taking it. After the things this man had said to him, and more importantly, to Ty, Zane wasn\u2019t feeling overly friendly. He also had pretty solid suspicions that Stuart and his buddies were behind the tiger poaching, and one of them had probably shot his father. Still, he didn\u2019t want to tip his cards yet, so he took the hand Stuart offered.</p><p>Stuart turned to Ty, offering to shake. Ty didn\u2019t stand; he merely drank his beer, one foot on the edge of the table in front of him, leaning back in his chair.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Grady, right?\u201d Stuart asked. \u201cStaff Sergeant Grady?\u201d</p><p>Ty looked at the man\u2019s hand, then at him. Zane glanced between them, wondering how the hell anyone had learned Ty had been a Staff Sergeant. He glanced at Mark as another wave of suspicion went through him.</p><p>It was impossible to see Ty\u2019s expression between the aviators and the Stetson. \u201cNice limp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAccidents happen when you work on a ranch.\u201d</p><p>Ty cocked his head, examining the man\u2019s leg. Zane knew his partner was seeing what no one else was.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to shake my hand?\u201d Stuart demanded.</p><p>Ty waited another few heartbeats, long enough to make the man even more uncomfortable. Then he slid to his feet. He was several inches taller, and when he stood, his proximity forced Stuart to take a step back. Ty offered his left hand, and Stuart was obligated to give him an awkward, backwards handshake. For whatever reason, it pissed the man off. He didn\u2019t say anything else, just turned on his heel and walked away. He was indeed limping, and it seemed more pronounced than it had several days ago.</p><p>\u201cThat was weird,\u201d Mark said, frowning hard.</p><p>Zane nodded.</p><p>Ty took a long drink of his beer. \u201cIs he one of the shooters?\u201d he asked, voice filled with cruel anticipation that sent a shiver of pleasure up Zane\u2019s spine.</p><p>\u201cI believe he is,\u201d Joe answered, smiling. \u201cHe and his buddy damn near beat Jamie and Mark last year.\u201d</p><p>Ty nodded. \u201cI\u2019m in.\u201d</p><p>The others let out whoops and started banging on the table, and Zane couldn\u2019t help but laugh. He set down his drink. \u201cI guess we ought to pay in, then.\u201d</p><p>The others chattered as Zane and Mark walked over to the stage to make the donations. When he returned to the table, Zane stopped at Ty\u2019s side and looked down at him. \u201cAll these boys are good. You better bring your A-game, Grady.\u201d</p><p>Ty just smiled and stood, reaching out to grab the three bottle caps he\u2019d collected and slide them into his pocket. \u201cLadies,\u201d he drawled as they left the table.</p><p>Ty\u2019s shoulder bumped Zane\u2019s as they walked, and it was harder than Zane expected to keep from wrapping his arm around his partner. He talked to distract himself.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s several events, and they tally scores for individuals and teams as we go along.\u201d They made their way to the shooting gallery, set up in a nearby corral. No one was allowed in before the contest started, to avoid any unfair advantages. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Ty said. He rolled up the sleeves of his thin linen shirt and wiped at his forehead with the buff on his wrist. They came up to the main table and surveyed the gear laid out. \u201cRifles, pistols, knives.\u201d Ty began to laugh. \u201cThe things you get me into.\u201d</p><p>Zane grinned. \u201cTexas,\u201d he said, since that was the answer to everything. \u201cWhat are you up to, Ty?\u201d</p><p>Ty just hummed as he wandered off toward the end of the table. Zane had no idea why Ty had offered to enter the contest, other than for the chance to stand close to one or more armed men they knew wanted Ty out of the picture.</p> <p>They wouldn\u2019t know what shots they were taking until they were unveiled during the contest, so they wouldn\u2019t know if there was a possibility of danger either.</p><p>If anyone was going to take a shot at Ty, though, this would be when they did it. Zane followed along, checking out the competition. He recognized a few of the men. Stuart and one of his asshole companions were there. Several hands from another neighboring ranch had signed up, as had Cody and Joe. Mark and Jamie made up the fifth team, and he and Ty would be the sixth. Zane shook his head as butterflies fluttered. He didn\u2019t have anything to prove here. It was for charity, and he didn\u2019t care what the others thought about him. What he was really looking forward to was Ty showing them all up. Or arresting them in the middle of it.</p><p>\u201cZane, are you entering the competition?\u201d</p><p>Zane looked up to see his mother and two of her friends approaching. \u201cYes, Mother. Along with Ty.\u201d</p><p>Beverly looked him over. \u201cWell. Good luck,\u201d she said. She lingered a moment, looking torn, but then moved away without saying anything more.</p> <p>Ty chose that moment to come sauntering back to Zane\u2019s side. He\u2019d managed to grab another bottle of beer from somewhere, like he was producing them out of his ass. \u201cThat\u2019s not awkward at all.\u201d</p><p>Zane shook his head.</p><p>Ty met his eyes, still grinning. \u201cYou really want to go into this thing with me after I\u2019ve been drinking and baking in the sun all day?\u201d</p><p>Ty\u2019s smile and his shining eyes were enough to make Zane forget all about his mother. \u201cAbsolutely. Let\u2019s kick some ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr shoot some.\u201d Ty shoved his shoulder into Zane\u2019s and they made their way toward the gathering of shooters awaiting instructions.</p><p>Ty and Zane were deemed Yellow Team. Judges directed them to stations set up through the corral and around the barn, and partygoers began gathering with them, bringing their cocktails along. The bleachers began to fill. Looking around, Zane wondered if he was the only sober person here. The thought was wildly funny for some reason.</p> <p>He was catching snippets of conversation from people around him, their words traveling in the heat in unpredictable ways.</p><p>\u201cIs that guy drinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that the Garrett boy\u2019s gentleman friend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not anything like I thought he\u2019d look. He\u2019s quite strapping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cZane looks good, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>Zane shook his head and turned his attention to their first challenge as all the teams gathered. It was a gallery of ten weighted ropes hung in a row, all different lengths and with varying sizes of weight attached. The idea was to shoot through the rope and make the weight drop. They would have a limited number of shots. He glanced to the judge approaching with a rifle.</p><p>\u201cPreference?\u201d he asked Ty.</p><p>Ty leaned back to look at the gun, then eyed the ropes with a growing smirk. \u201cI kick ass with a rifle,\u201d he whispered, then took a slow sip of his beer.</p> <p>\u201cThen by all means,\u201d Zane drawled, sweeping one hand toward the judge.</p><p>\u201cGentlemen, pick your shooters. The rest of the team members, if you will please join the crowd.\u201d</p><p>Zane waited until Ty was passing by to whisper, \u201cI\u2019d kiss you for luck, but it would probably cause a ruckus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo will your shooting,\u201d Ty told him, and he smacked Zane on the hip for good measure, then handed him his beer bottle. \u201cHold this.\u201d</p><p>Zane took the bottle with a good-natured snort. With Ty in his line of sight, the beer in his hand wasn\u2019t even a temptation.</p><p>Zane scanned the crowd. He found Harrison standing over to the side, talking to some of the judges. When Harrison looked up, Zane caught his eye and nodded. To Zane\u2019s delight, Harrison mimed a pistol with his finger and thumb to shoot at him.</p><p>Zane turned to watch the competition, feeling much lighter all of a sudden. It still shocked him how much his parents\u2019 approval meant to him. He knew he would never gain his mother\u2019s, but Ty had been right about his father; he was epic.</p><p>The first shooter was given the rifle and told where to stand as the others moved to a safe observation point. They weren\u2019t wearing earplugs or safety glasses like they should have been. Ty glanced around and pulled his aviators out of his shirt pocket to slide them on. He looked in Zane\u2019s direction as the first man took aim and fired at his first weighted rope.</p><p>Ty didn\u2019t flinch away, holding Zane\u2019s gaze with each rifle blast. Just because he could, Zane gave Ty a quick wink.</p><p>Ty smiled, the same evil smirk Zane knew so well. Whether they won the whole thing or lost every single contest, Zane knew he was getting laid later. It almost made him want to ditch the entire day and take Ty somewhere secluded.</p><p>Ty finally turned his attention back to the shooting. The first contestant had hit four of the ropes but only snapped three. He\u2019d also hit one of the weighted bags, and sand was gushing out of the holes. His score of three was chalked up on a large board on the side of the gallery, and the rifle was reloaded and new ropes tied up. There was a smattering of distracted applause as the next shooter, Stuart\u2019s teammate, went up. He didn\u2019t fare much better. The ropes were tough and thick, and though they snapped when nicked with the heavier weights, the lighter weights weren\u2019t enough to pull a missed shot.</p><p>Annie appeared at Zane\u2019s elbow. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think your husband is in for some stiff competition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re blinded by love.\u201d</p><p>Zane nodded, acknowledging the truth in that. He looked over the other competitors standing with Ty. They were all capable ranch hands, and Mark had been a Marine. But like Ty had said, this sort of competition was as much a puzzle as it was a test of skill. What he was really concerned about was Stuart, and the idea that Mark was the mastermind behind their trouble.</p><p>\u201cMark keep up with the rifle range?\u201d Zane asked.</p><p>\u201cLike clockwork,\u201d Annie replied.</p><p>As new ropes were hung up and the rifle reloaded, Ty stepped away from the others and began fiddling with his shirtsleeve again. Apparently it was his turn. Zane watched him, recognizing some of the quirky mannerisms, but not others. He didn\u2019t seem to be paying much attention to what was going on, or he was drunk, and he seemed supremely distracted by the cuff of his shirt. It wouldn\u2019t roll up like he wanted it to.</p><p>\u201cIs he okay to shoot?\u201d Annie asked.</p><p>Zane covered a laugh by clearing his throat. \u201cYeah, he\u2019s fine. Superstitious, you know? Never steps on home base before a game, that kind of thing.\u201d</p><p>Annie hummed but she didn\u2019t say anything else, and Zane gave her a regretful glance. He prayed they were wrong about Mark.</p><p>Finally, Ty stepped closer to Mark and said something, to which Mark gave him a tolerant look and reached out to fix his shirt cuff for him. Ty thanked him with a smack on his shoulder that sent Mark stumbling sideways, and Ty sauntered up to the judge holding the rifle and took it with an easy grin.</p><p>He looked the rifle over and hefted it. \u201cThat\u2019s nice,\u201d he said, loud enough for the crowd to hear. \u201cWhat is it, Marlin .44 Special?\u201d</p><p>The judge nodded, frowning.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s real nice,\u201d Ty said. He cradled the rifle in the crook of his arm, the muzzle aimed carelessly toward where Stuart stood. Stuart flinched as the barrel swung his way.</p><p>\u201cWatch where you aim that damn thing!\u201d Stuart shouted. A round of laughter followed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m watching,\u201d Ty said, his tone lazy but his words heavy. He rested the rifle in the crook of his arm, using his other hand to discreetly keep the barrel aimed at Stuart as he moved forward to stand on the X marked in the sand.</p><p>Stuart sidestepped but couldn\u2019t get out from under Ty\u2019s aim. He flushed in the hot sun. Zane read his lips as he called Ty all kinds of unsavory names.</p><p>Annie turned a look of disbelief on Zane, who had to cover his mouth to muffle the laugh. He knew Ty; there was no way he\u2019d pick up that rifle while drunk unless he or someone he loved was threatened. Ty was playing it up. He was also sending Stuart a clear message: they had him in their sights.</p><p>\u201cShooter ready?\u201d the judge called, and Ty brought the six-pound rifle up to snug it against his shoulder. His stance was wide and even, and something about the way his shoulders rounded was incredibly fun to watch. But he was having a hard time gripping the rifle. A ripple of laughter went through the crowd; they expected him to make a fool of himself.</p><p>\u201cZane, I told you we should have cut off this cast,\u201d Ty called out.</p><p>He had a point. He couldn\u2019t just switch up and shoot lefty with a rifle. The cartridges were made to eject to the right of the shooter, and if he fired with his left hand, the hot cartridge would eject right into his face after every round.</p><p>\u201cHope he shoots better than he fights,\u201d Stuart said loudly, and another round of laughter followed.</p><p>The first shot of the .44 kicked Ty back, but his aim was true and the bullet snapped through the rope just an inch above the weight. A murmur of surprise went through the crowd. He rattled off six more shots in rapid succession, his long fingers cocking the rifle with practiced speed and ease despite the cumbersome cast. Each shot drew more sounds from the crowd, until many were hooting and whistling every time he dropped a target. It was an impressive show.</p><p>And then he missed. The eighth rope twisted as the bullet grazed it. A groan ran through the crowd. Ty shrugged his shoulders and looked up from the sights of the rifle. He grumbled something. He tried the next rope and missed again, fraying the rope but not enough to make the lighter weight drop. He graced the crowd with a distinctive curse, held up his broken right hand and waved it, then aimed at the last rope.</p><p>The weight dropped with an anticlimactic plop in the sand, followed by a round of rowdy calls.</p><p>Ty handed the rifle off, then threw his hands up and took a cheeky bow for the crowd. They ate it up, and Zane had to shake his head. His lover was a born entertainer who liked to kill things. How he wasn\u2019t in a psychiatric ward or on a Most Wanted list somewhere was anyone\u2019s guess.</p><p>Zane tore his eyes away from Ty to glance at Stuart. The man looked a little green now, and even Mark was shifting his weight nervously.</p><p>\u201cHuh,\u201d Annie said, turning to Zane with a suspicious look.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Annie rolled her eyes. \u201cYou brought in a ringer.\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s lips twitched. \u201cNo. Although his lethality is a hell of a benefit.\u201d</p><p>Annie smacked his arm once, then again, and Zane shoved at her hand, rubbing his arm and laughing. \u201cHey, I\u2019ve got to shoot. Stop it!\u201d</p><p>Annie poked him in the chest. \u201cI have to go home with Mark! You know what kind of mood he\u2019ll be in if you beat him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who pushed us to enter!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, I thought you\u2019d bomb!\u201d</p><p>Zane wrapped his arm around her shoulders and pulled her close. It hurt to think he\u2019d have to be the one to tell her that her husband was the bad guy, and he hoped Ty was wrong this time. He looked up to see Ty walking\u2014no, swaggering\u2014over to the other shooters waiting their turn. He hugged Annie tighter.</p><p>Ty stopped in front of Mark first, smirking, and held out his arm. \u201cLuck must have rubbed off on me,\u201d he said as he swiped at his shirtsleeve. \u201cWant it back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh Lord.\u201d Annie shoved at Zane\u2019s chest and walked away. Zane smiled sadly. Annie still thought this was a friendly shooting competition.</p><p>Ty came to stand beside Zane, valiantly trying to restrain his grin. Zane glanced at him, snorted, and pressed his lips together hard to stave off the laugh. \u201cYou\u2019re such a showboat.\u201d</p><p>Ty turned to him, the sun reflecting off his sunglasses as a smile flitted across his lips. He pushed his hat back. \u201cYou telling me you didn\u2019t enjoy that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I enjoyed it a little too much. One down, several to go.\u201d Zane grinned. \u201cAnd at least you look good.\u201d</p><p>Ty clucked his tongue. \u201cDamn good.\u201d</p><p>Zane couldn\u2019t stop himself from sliding his hand against Ty\u2019s back. Mark took up his spot and readied to shoot.</p><p>\u201cWatch this,\u201d Ty said, almost laughing.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d you do?\u201d</p><p>The crowd fell quiet. After a few heartbeats, Mark pulled the trigger. His shot grazed the rope but merely frayed it. He had missed the first and easiest shot.</p><p>Zane cleared his throat and stared at his boots for a long moment, trying not to tip their hand with his expression. \u201cWhat\u2019d you do?\u201d he asked Ty under his breath.</p><p>\u201cGot in his head, stole his luck,\u201d Ty said. Mark turned to glare at them, and Ty pointedly wiped his imaginary luck off his shirt cuff, still grinning.</p><p>Mark rolled his eyes and set up again. He made the next shot, and the next. Ty was still laughing, obviously enjoying the mental game as well as the physical one. This was the same part of Ty that enjoyed profiling.</p><p>Mark ended up scoring one less than Ty, and although he looked like he was shaking it off, Zane didn\u2019t miss his narrowed eyes as Mark walked off the range.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care if we win,\u201d Zane said as he watched Mark and Annie talk. \u201cBut I\u2019d really like to beat him. And Stuart.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ty hummed. \u201cCut my cast off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I don\u2019t want to do that. You\u2019re taking advantage of the situation,\u201d Zane grumbled, though there wasn\u2019t any heat behind it. Would it be horrible of him to consider re-injuring Ty\u2019s hand if it meant beating Mark and that asshole Stuart in this stupid competition?</p><p>Ty looked over his sunglasses at Zane. \u201cOkay. But I can\u2019t promise a win with only one hand. And what if all hell breaks loose? I\u2019ll need both hands then.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTell me now, no shit, that your hand\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>Ty laughed incredulously. \u201cIt\u2019s broken. Of course it\u2019s not okay.\u201d</p><p>Zane glanced toward Mark and back. \u201cNo,\u201d he said, setting his fingers on Ty\u2019s cast. It was the most pitiful excuse for a cast he\u2019d ever seen, covered with signatures, phone numbers, a knife wound, several places where Ty had tried to saw at it, and tiger bites. Dirty beyond all reason, and it didn\u2019t smell like the most wonderful thing in the world. It was probably uncomfortable, too.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not worth it,\u201d he said, trying to tell himself that as much as Ty. \u201cBesides, if we win anyway, it\u2019s that much worse for him to know he got beaten by a man with a broken hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you say so, Quickdraw.\u201d</p> <p>Zane turned to look at him, watching him raptly as Ty took a step forward and waved a hand when they were announced as the winning team for that challenge.</p><p>As a group they moved on to the next round, Ty hummed under his breath, his elbow brushing Zane\u2019s. Zane soon made out the Battle Hymn in the hum, and he groaned.</p><p>At the next station, a bowl of fruit sat on the table, and the same Marlin .44 Special was being reloaded. The judge began telling the shooters what they were supposed to be doing, and the instructions made it clear that Zane would be the one trying his hand at this one. The shooter would take three oranges from the bowl, toss them in the air, and shoot as many as he could before they hit the ground.</p><p>Ty leaned over to whisper in Zane\u2019s ear. \u201cThat rifle weighs six pounds. No way I can swing it with my hand. This one\u2019s all you, big boy.\u201d He smacked Zane\u2019s ass and turned to head for the crowd.</p><p>\u201cTy,\u201d Zane hissed. Ty turned to look at him. \u201cMake yourself scarce, huh? This is the perfect shot to claim a misfire into the crowd, know what I mean?\u201d</p><p>Ty nodded, but then he sauntered over to stand shoulder to shoulder with Stuart\u2019s teammate in the front row.</p> <p>\u201cGreat,\u201d Zane said under his breath. He headed up to the table with the other competitors. He was a good shot with a rifle, that wasn\u2019t his concern. But he\u2019d have preferred a practice run with this shot. He just hoped he didn\u2019t drop the rifle.</p><p>He stopped at the table with the others, and someone bumped his shoulder. He looked up to see Mark grinning at him.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t figure he\u2019d be able to do this one with that cast,\u201d Mark said. \u201cWhen was the last time you fired a rifle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a while.\u201d</p><p>Mark clapped Zane\u2019s shoulder, hard enough that Zane had to take a step to keep his balance. \u201cBuck up, brother. Time for a lesson from the master.\u201d</p><p>Zane glanced at Ty. This was a bad idea. He knew the game Ty was playing with their quarry, and he shouldn\u2019t have encouraged it. Ty raised his chin and gave Zane a languid smile. He didn\u2019t look worried.</p><p>Mark volunteered to go first. Zane couldn\u2019t shake the tension as he waited, praying he was wrong about his brother-in-law. He knew what kind of shot Mark was. If he missed one of those oranges and it went anywhere near the crowd, it was a warning shot, loud and clear.</p><p>Mark chose three oranges from the bowl, picked up the firearm, and moved into place. When the judge blew the whistle, Mark tossed, flipped the rifle up from the crook of his arm, and took the shots, quickly pulling the lever between each one. Juice flew through the air as all three rotten oranges exploded.</p> <p>Zane released a pent-up breath, but he couldn\u2019t relax. Just because Mark had yet to make a move didn\u2019t mean he wasn\u2019t going to. The next two shooters hit two each, one man missed all three, and Stuart caught all three even though he tossed them a little too close to the edge of the crowd for Zane\u2019s comfort. Then it was Zane\u2019s turn. He resisted the urge to look over his shoulder at Ty, but he imagined he could feel Ty\u2019s eyes on him.</p><p>\u201cNothing like taking shots at a couple fruits, huh Garrett?\u201d Stuart hissed as he passed by him.</p><p>Zane narrowed his eyes, refusing to rise to the bait.</p><p>He settled the rifle in the crook of his arm, nodded to the judge, and chose his oranges. They gave under his fingers, enough that he almost laughed, and it helped dispel the nerves. Determined not to dwell on what he was doing as he headed toward the mark in the sand, Zane took a deep breath, exhaled, and tossed the fruit, pulling up the rifle and shooting.</p><p>Two oranges disintegrated in the air, and the third exploded just before it was about to hit the ground.</p><p>Zane blinked in shock as the crowd applauded. He handed the rifle back to the judge before walking over to Ty with a shrug.</p><p>\u201cYou sure as hell showed those oranges who was boss,\u201d Ty said, though the pride in his voice was easy for Zane to hear.</p><p>Zane chuckled, relaxing even more. \u201cNever mind that it\u2019s been a few months since I even touched a rifle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so getting laid tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucky me.\u201d</p><p>The contests continued, each event getting more outlandish and difficult, each rife with an undercurrent of antagonism and threats. Ty had to fire a Colt revolver over his shoulder using a mirror, holding it with his left hand, to shoot the ace of spades out of a playing card. He was the only shooter to even nick the card, much less the spade, and he came in first. Zane did both knife-tossing contests, the first to hit a stationary target, the second to hit a target painted on a watermelon as it swung like a pendulum. He won both and caused quite a stir when he twirled the knife around his hand before giving it back to the judge.</p><p>With each show of their skill, Stuart looked more and more mutinous. Zane could feel in every fiber of his being that something was going to happen tonight. The only question was who would instigate it\u2014Ty or Stuart?</p><p>As sunset encroached, Ty was left to handle the last event: the lasso.</p><p>\u201cGoddammit, Zane, you should have let me throw the first knife!\u201d Ty hissed when the event was revealed.</p><p>Zane couldn\u2019t help but laugh. Ty could handle any weapon someone put in his hands and do it with competence, if not skill. A lasso was the last thing Zane had expected, but even if they came in second place in this event, they would still win the whole thing.</p><p>Ty was shaking his head, muttering under his breath as they watched Mark take his turn. Before Zane could quell the urge, he pulled his lover close to give him a very public kiss. It caused a few gasps and murmurs, and Zane could feel all those eyes on them. He didn\u2019t care. Ty didn\u2019t flail or tense up, and Zane felt him smiling against his lips.</p><p>\u201cEven if we don\u2019t win this,\u201d Zane said, \u201cthank you.\u201d</p><p>Ty nodded, lingering just long enough to make Zane\u2019s heart beat faster. Then the judge called for the last contestant to take his turn, and Ty gave Zane one last glance and a smile before stepping out into the cleared arena. There were three targets, and the closer he came to the smallest target, the higher his points. The most he could get was six, and they only needed one point to beat Mark and Jamie.</p><p>Zane laughed heartily as Ty tried to get the rope settled in his left hand. He might have been able to handle the thick, heavy rope with both hands, but with his dominant hand in a cast, it was just too much for him.</p><p>The crowd began to buzz, ripples of laughter going through it.</p><p>\u201cIf I was a rodeo clown, you\u2019d all be gored to death,\u201d Ty said as he finally got the rope in place.</p><p>There was more laughter, and Zane realized he was grinning from ear to ear as he watched his lover make a spectacle of himself.</p><p>When Ty got the rope going in circles over his head, Zane thought his partner might actually have paid attention when he\u2019d tried to teach him. He had good form, and the rope was swinging like it needed to. But then Ty released the lasso too early, and the toss came sailing toward Zane and the other contestants instead of the targets.</p><p>Stuart didn\u2019t have time to dodge it; he just stood there as the rope dropped around his shoulders and Ty pulled it tight. He stumbled forward, arms trapped at his sides as the crowd burst into raucous laughter and applause.</p><p>\u201cSorry!\u201d Ty said with a wave of his hand that pulled the lasso tighter.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing!\u201d Stuart bawled. \u201cYou fucking moron!\u201d</p><p>Ty pulled him forward again, and Zane could only shake his head as he watched, stunned by his partner\u2019s gall.</p><p>Ty continued to apologize profusely, making a show of being a bumbling drunken idiot, and Stuart kept up a litany of cursing and accusations as Ty inexplicably managed to wrap him up even more instead of helping him out of the ropes.</p><p>\u201cWow, these things are really complicated, aren\u2019t they?\u201d Ty said over the raucous laughter of the crowd. Stuart lost his balance and tumbled to the ground. Ty stood over him. \u201cHow do you make it let go?\u201d</p><p>Stuart\u2019s friends came over to help, strong-arming Ty out of the way. He held up both hands and took a few steps back, the picture of innocence.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re insane,\u201d Zane said as soon as he drew close. Ty was grinning, his eyes sparkling in the dying sunlight as they watched Stuart struggle to get loose.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to do that,\u201d he said, as gleeful as a schoolboy who\u2019d just caught a frog.</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>Ty looked Zane up and down, as if sizing him up, then he gave a lecherous grin. \u201cYou think we could take one of those lassos home with us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTy, focus!\u201d</p><p>Ty grinned. \u201cWe got him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn sure.\u201d</p><p>Mark and Jamie were declared the winners amidst a round of polite applause as Ty and Zane discussed it. When Zane was declared the individual winner of the event, he looked around in surprise as everyone cheered.</p><p>\u201cNicely done, Big Iron,\u201d Ty said to him.</p><p>Zane looked at him suspiciously as Ty patted him on the shoulder. If Ty had made that lasso toss, he would have won.</p><p>Harrison came up to smack each of them on the back. \u201cWell, if it ain\u2019t Pancho and Lefty. Looks like you caught you one,\u201d he said to Ty with a big grin. He put his arm around Zane\u2019s shoulder. \u201cThat was a mighty fine show you put on. Boy, I had no idea you could throw a knife like that.\u201d</p><p>Zane felt himself blushing. Ty patted him on the shoulder and gave him a wink. \u201cI\u2019m going to go have a discussion with the sheriff,\u201d he said, then left Zane alone with his father.</p><p>\u201cI guess . . . we have a lot of catching up to do,\u201d Zane said with a hopeful smile.</p><p>\u201cYou bet your ass we do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you talked to Mother?\u201d</p><p>Harrison\u2019s jaw tightened and his eyes grew harder. He nodded curtly. \u201cIf she intends to make me choose between my wife and my son, she\u2019s got a surprise coming. I hope you and your boy decide to come down more often.\u201d Harrison threw a pointed look at Ty, who had melted into the crowd, shaking hands, laughing with strangers. He\u2019d been accepted for the most part, whether by his own doing or Harrison\u2019s influence, Zane didn\u2019t know. Zane\u2019s mother could sign all the legal documents she wanted; it wasn\u2019t going to pierce through Zane\u2019s armor now.</p><p>Zane nodded, throat tightening. \u201cI think we\u2019ll be able to manage that.\u201d</p><p>Harrison patted him on the cheek. \u201cDid you catch him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTy claims he has proof enough to get the sheriff. That\u2019s what he\u2019s doing now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hope he\u2019s right. Why do you look worried?\u201d</p><p>Zane took a deep breath. \u201cWe think Mark\u2019s involved.\u201d</p><p>Harrison inhaled sharply. \u201cI hope you\u2019re wrong on that one, son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>Zane remained there as his father walked away, the feeling of warmth and acceptance spreading deeper into him. His mother and their suspicions of Mark were a small blight on an otherwise bright day. He set off into the crowd to find Ty again, feeling somehow that if it weren\u2019t for Ty, he would never have come home, and he would have drifted through life alone until it killed him. Ty had given him a new home, and then shown him he still had his old one.</p><p>He was still musing over the twists and turns of life when a commotion broke out ahead of him. He pushed through the crowd to see what was going on, and somehow he wasn\u2019t surprised to see Ty in the thick of it. Ty stood with the sheriff and two of his deputies, facing Stuart and his three friends. Stuart was in Ty\u2019s face as the crowd cleared for them.</p><p>\u201cYou accusing me of something, boy?\u201d Stuart was saying as Zane came up on them.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m saying I know where you got that limp,\u201d Ty said.</p><p>Stuart puffed up his chest like he was trying for courage as he glared up at Ty. Both deputies put their hands on their firearms, ready for a show of force.</p><p>Everyone and his brother was armed, and the tension was gathering in the air.</p><p>Zane stepped forward, standing behind Ty and the sheriff. The others joined him, Cody, Mark, and Joe finding their way into the clearing. Zane put Mark to his side, not allowing his brother-in-law to be behind him.</p><p>\u201cYou think you know something about me? Go ahead and say it!\u201d Stuart shouted.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been poaching tigers,\u201d Ty said, as calm as the breeze. \u201cYou\u2019re running something out there, and you shot me in the chest with a dart that damn near killed me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got no proof. Sheriff, this is ridiculous. You gonna let this queer come in here and tell you what to do?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The sheriff nodded curtly. \u201cHe seems to know what he\u2019s talking about, Stuart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit! You got no proof!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got my knife in your boot.\u201d</p> <p>Stuart took a swing. Ty leaned away from it and trapped Stuart\u2019s fist between both hands. He jabbed his elbow under the man\u2019s chin, sending him reeling back, then kicked at his thigh and caused his leg to buckle. Stuart went to his knees, and Ty kicked him in the chest, sending him sprawling into the dirt.</p><p>The sheriff and his deputies pulled their weapons, fanning out to surround Stuart and his cohorts.</p><p>Ty put one booted foot on Stuart\u2019s neck, pressing down with the heel to keep him still. It had happened so fast that none of Stuart\u2019s buddies had been able to move to help, and when the guns turned on them they each raised their hands, sinking to their knees without putting up a fight.</p><p>Harrison forced his way through the crowd. \u201cWhat in the Sam Hill is going on here?\u201d</p><p>Ty didn\u2019t lift his boot off Stuart\u2019s throat. \u201cI put my knife into the thigh of one of the poachers who attacked me.\u201d</p> <p>Sheriff Barnes looked down at Stuart. The spot where Ty had kicked him was beginning to bleed. The sheriff pursed his lips, then bent to look in Stuart\u2019s boot where Ty was pointing. He pulled a knife out of the sheath the man had tucked into his boot and held it up. It was a Strider SA model. A simple, sturdy knife about seven inches long. Zane knew the leather-wrapped handle was worn from years of use, and that the sheriff would find the words \u201cS. SGT BT GRADY\u201d engraved in the hilt.</p><p>The sheriff looked up at Ty and nodded. He pulled his radio from its belt and called to his dispatcher. \u201cWe caught the poachers.\u201d</p><p>Ty moved his foot off Stuart\u2019s neck as Zane joined him.</p><p>\u201cThere were more than four people involved,\u201d Zane told the sheriff.</p><p>Ty and Zane stepped back to let the deputies handcuff their prisoners. They rolled Stuart to his belly and yanked his hands behind his back.</p><p>\u201cYou think you know everything, you fucking queers?\u201d Stuart snarled against the dirt. \u201cYou got trouble in your own damn house!\u201d</p> <p>Zane stalked forward and bent down to grab a handful of his hair. \u201cTrouble in my house? Who?\u201d</p><p>Stuart gave him a toothy grin. \u201cYou got no idea.\u201d He looked over his shoulder as he lay in the dust. \u201cI want a lawyer.\u201d</p><p>Ty grabbed Zane\u2019s arm and pulled him up before Zane could throttle a restrained prisoner in front of witnesses.</p><p>\u201cWe need to go back to that pump house,\u201d Ty hissed in his ear as he bullied him away from the others. Zane stopped fighting him and let himself be dragged to the edge of the crowd. \u201cWe need to do it now.\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s eyes landed on Mark, and he was unable to tear them away as he nodded. \u201cLet\u2019s get out there before he does.\u201d</p><p>They slipped through the crowd, lost in the excitement of the confrontation, and headed around the barn, where the family had parked their vehicles to keep them out of the way and block off certain parts of the ranch from partygoers.</p><p>The chaotic hum of the milling crowd on the other side of the barn was overwhelmed by the distinct sound of a tiger roaring.</p><p>Silence overcame the ranch. The sound ripped its way through Zane\u2019s body like nothing else he\u2019d ever experienced, and he and Ty both froze in their tracks. The tiger roared again, the sound culminating in a low, seemingly endless rumble. It was like a purr from hell.</p> <p>The crowd on the other side of the barn began to boil with panic. Screaming and shouting, people scrambled to get to safety.</p><p>Zane felt the hairs rise on his neck, a feeling of foreboding overtaking him as Ty\u2019s hand tightened on his arm. He turned his head, knowing Barnum the Bengal tiger was there before he ever caught sight of him. Ty turned with him. Barnum sat twenty yards away, watching them. He chuffed and sniffed the air.</p><p>There was a buzzing sound over Ty\u2019s harsh breaths and the sounds of the terrified partygoers, and Zane realized it was panic encroaching.</p><p>The tiger made another sound, an odd hissing that Zane soon realized hadn\u2019t come from the tiger at all. It was Ty, making the same sound he did to call Smith and Wesson.</p><p>He did it again and took a step forward.</p><p>\u201cOh Jesus, Ty, this is not how I want to die,\u201d Zane whispered.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it isn\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>Barnum stood and lowered his head. He took a step to match Ty\u2019s. Ty took another. Barnum chuffed and drew closer, looking wary.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s scared, Zane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he should join the fucking club.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Barnum.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTy, you are not the tiger whisperer,\u201d Zane hissed.</p><p>Ty held out a hand to calm him, then took a few more steps toward Barnum. In the blink of an eye, Barnum lowered his body and lunged at Ty, wrapping his arms around his head and dragging his face against Ty\u2019s as he stood on his hind legs and hugged him. His massive body dwarfed Ty, and Zane could only see Ty\u2019s arms as he returned the tiger\u2019s hug. Barnum continued to rub his floppy ear against Ty\u2019s face.</p><p>Zane stood rooted to the spot, mouth hanging open, shaking his head.</p><p>After a few long moments, Barnum released Ty and sat down. Ty staggered back and leaned over, gasping for breath.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the stupidest thing I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d Zane whispered, still stunned.</p><p>Ty began to laugh. \u201cThat\u2019s what he did in his enclosure.\u201d He held out his fist to the tiger, and Barnum smacked him with his paw like he was giving him a fist bump. \u201cLoves to hug.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an idiot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to get those animal control morons over here. Or call the sanctuary, let them know we found him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a fucking idiot!\u201d</p><p>Ty straightened and Barnum sent a low grumble in Zane\u2019s direction. Ty shook his head, smirking a little. \u201cMy tiger disagrees, Zane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo call the place, I\u2019ll stay here with him, keep him calm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, what do you want me to do with him?\u201d</p><p>Zane stared. Both Ty and Barnum were looking at him with their heads cocked. He wasn\u2019t even sure he was awake right now. \u201cHow tame is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Tame enough that he\u2019d rather hug me than eat me right now, but I don\u2019t fucking speak tiger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould we give him food so he won\u2019t eat anybody?\u201d</p><p>\u201cZane. Why are you asking me like I know what to do? Sure, go grab a brisket off the grill and we\u2019ll see how he likes it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBriskets aren\u2019t cooked on a grill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m standing next to a tiger, Zane!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go call the sanctuary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Zane took a careful step back, giving Barnum one last wary look before turning and calmly walking to the corner of the barn. He couldn\u2019t run no matter how much he wanted to. He remembered what Tish had said about playing tag with a tiger.</p><p>He was halfway to the house when his father hurried up to him. \u201cHave you seen Sadie?\u201d Harrison demanded.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe called animal control to get their worthless asses out here and got people leaving for safety, but we can\u2019t find Sadie!\u201d</p><p>Zane went cold. He turned to look back at the barn.</p><p>If the tiger didn\u2019t have the little girl, then who did?</p><p>Ty fought the urge to fidget. It wasn\u2019t hard, what with Barnum leaning against his leg and demanding contact. He stroked Barnum\u2019s cheek, one of the places Tish had told him was safe when handling the tigers. His heart was still racing. Tame circus tiger or not, he was still a fucking tiger and they were not in his enclosure anymore.</p><p>The seconds ticked by, and Ty imagined he could feel time expanding as he waited. What the fuck was taking Zane so long?</p><p>He looked down at Barnum, and the tiger peered up at him, tongue lolling, his golden eyes full of intelligence and trust. A chill ran down Ty\u2019s body and he fought the resulting shiver.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, big man?\u201d Ty asked, maintaining a soothing tone. Barnum made a few chuffing noises, responding to his voice. Ty swallowed against the knot of nerves in his throat and began to sing. The first song that popped into his mind was one he used to sing during his Recon days: \u201cShow Me the Way to Go Home.\u201d It was slow and soothing and easy to remember the words to when trying not to panic.</p><p>Barnum hefted his body to stand and sniffed the air again. He took a few steps away, and Ty forgot about the song. Then Barnum prowled to the side, beginning to pace.</p><p>\u201cOh please don\u2019t eat me,\u201d Ty whispered.</p><p>Barnum rumbled in response, sniffing the air again. He glanced back at Ty in passing, then stalked off toward the darkness, heading away from the barn.</p><p>\u201cBarnum,\u201d Ty whispered. He clucked his tongue and made a few hissing noises, but who the hell was he kidding? If the tiger wanted to go, it was going to go. \u201cCome on, buddy, don\u2019t leave me. I\u2019ll sing a different one,\u201d he said as he followed after the big cat. \u201c\u2018Eye of the Tiger\u2019?\u201d</p><p>But Barnum paid him no mind, slinking off into the night so quickly and quietly that Ty lost him in a matter of yards.</p><p>Ty peered into the darkness, his heart pounding hard. \u201cEveryone\u2019s a critic,\u201d he grumbled as he backed away from the last spot he\u2019d seen Barnum. It was just too dangerous to track the tiger in the dark, no matter how tame or friendly Barnum seemed to be. Ty needed to get to safety, and then warn the rest of the partygoers.</p><p>He continued to back away, turning once he no longer felt eyes tracking him. He made his way to the truck and climbed in, breathing a sigh of relief when he got the door closed behind him.</p><p>He found the keys under the brake pedal, where Zane often left them, and got the truck started. He drove right through the yard, not especially surprised to find that the party had dispersed. Harrison had probably taken that precaution and moved the guests inside or sent them home. The bonfire still blazed, sending ashes into the night sky. Torches were lit around the yard, marking the areas intended for the party and keeping bugs at bay. But there was no other sign of life.</p><p>Ty pushed down the creepy feeling and headed for the house, parking the truck right at the bottom of the steps. He had been chewed on by enough felines in his lifetime, thank you.</p><p>He hopped out of the truck and darted up the steps, then slung open the screen door and didn\u2019t relax until it had clicked behind him.</p><p>A gun cocked near his ear, and the distinct barrel of a .45 pressed to his temple.</p><p>Ty froze.</p><p>\u201cGrady?\u201d</p><p>Ty risked a sideways look past the barrel of the gun and found Cody standing there.</p><p>Cody lowered the gun and smiled. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>Ty shook his head, growling but unable to produce a curse word appropriate for the moment. \u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSadie\u2019s gone missing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Ty asked, his heart sinking.</p><p>Cody nodded grimly. Ty noticed that he hadn\u2019t put his gun away. \u201cThey think the tiger nabbed her.\u201d</p><p>Ty looked from Cody to the gun. \u201cSo you thought I was a tiger?\u201d</p><p>Cody shook his head. \u201cStuart said we got trouble in our own house. Can\u2019t be too careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are the others?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Party broke up, everyone got scattered looking for Little Bit.\u201d</p><p>Ty glanced around the quiet house, then back at Cody. \u201cCome with me. I need you to drive me out to that pump house.\u201d</p><p>Cody nodded and headed out onto the porch. Ty followed, glancing around the yard. The night was silent. No insects sang, no horses whinnied from the barns. None of the animals made a peep.</p><p>\u201cWhy are we headed back out there?\u201d Cody asked.</p><p>\u201cWhatever\u2019s under that place, that\u2019s what this is about. It\u2019s not just stolen tigers. And I think whoever has Sadie might be headed there.\u201d</p><p>Ty hopped down the steps. The crack of a gunshot tore through the night, and the impact thumped into Ty, stealing his breath and knocking him flat.</p><p>Somewhere in the darkness, Barnum the Bengal tiger roared.</p><p>Chapter 10</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t get how she can just disappear!\u201d Harrison sounded near panicked as they rounded the dark corner of the house and headed for the front yard again.</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t disappear, Dad, Mark\u2019s got her! He\u2019s running with her!\u201d</p><p>Harrison grabbed Zane\u2019s arm and whirled him around almost viciously. \u201cYou best be damn sure before you say that out loud again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d Zane said through gritted teeth. \u201cI have to get back to Ty and let him know what\u2019s going on before he and that damn tiger get twitchy.\u201d</p><p>Harrison nodded.</p><p>Zane turned the corner of the house in time to see Ty and Cody hurrying down the front steps. \u201cTy!\u201d he called out, but his shout was drowned out by the crack of the gunshot. Ty and Cody both fell to the ground, either hit or taking cover. Zane shouted again, drawing his weapon.</p><p>Harrison grabbed him and yanked him back just as a shot thumped into the house.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Zane fought against his dad\u2019s hands.</p><p>Harrison slammed him against the siding. \u201cYou ain\u2019t no good to him dead, Z! Get inside.\u201d</p><p>Zane opened his mouth to respond, but the sudden shatter of glass and a crash from behind the house cut him off. They hit the ground, and a shadow hustled through the trees, the moonlight glinting off a shotgun. The shooters were aiming at the house and at them. Bullets glanced off the walls, far too close for comfort.</p><p>Harrison clamped down on the back of Zane\u2019s neck and wrenched him to his feet. \u201cGet in the house!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They scrambled for the French doors of Beverly\u2019s office.</p><p>Zane took the steps three at a time as bullets tore up the fa\u00e7ade, splintering the wood and sending flowers spilling from broken pots. He ran for the den and its gun cabinets, trying not to think about the odds outside or the image of Ty falling to the ground that kept replaying in his head. He yanked a case open and grabbed a shotgun and a rifle. They were loaded and ready to go; guns in the Garrett household were meant to be used, not admired for their shiny parts.</p><p>\u201cWhat in the blazing hinges of hell is going on out there!\u201d Harrison took one of the weapons from Zane\u2019s hand.</p> <p>\u201cI have no idea!\u201d Zane loaded up a shotgun and grabbed a handful of extra rounds. \u201cSee if you can find the family, get everyone upstairs.\u201d</p><p>Harrison grabbed him as he was turning away. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTy\u2019s out there,\u201d Zane said. He yanked away and ran for the front door.</p><p>When he got to the door he hit the marble, staying low as he peered out. Ty was nowhere to be seen. Only a blood smear on the front steps was left of him.</p><p>\u201cTy!\u201d Zane called out. Above the commotion he heard his name called in response. He strained his ears, but instead of Ty, he heard the galloping of horses. In the flickering firelight, he caught silhouettes of horses racing into the night; the entire stock of the C and G had fled from a barn as flames licked at its roof.</p> <p>Zane\u2019s mind flooded with horror at the sudden outburst of violence. Whoever had been working with Stuart didn\u2019t trust him not to give them away. They were making a break for it tonight.</p><p>Gunfire from the back of the house sounded like it was coming from outside and within. His father was firing back.</p><p>Zane picked up his rifle and crawled out the door, intent on finding Ty. \u201cWhere the fuck are you?\u201d Zane muttered. He hurried down the steps, staying low. Blood stained the steps, but not as much as he\u2019d feared. Ty may have been able to get up under his own power and find cover.</p><p>Zane crouched low and skirted the truck parked in front of the steps, heading for the barn. \u201cGrady!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGarrett!\u201d</p><p>Zane skidded to a halt and turned. He finally saw Ty, lying under the truck on his back. Zane dove for it, peering underneath with a relieved laugh. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cClipped me. I\u2019m bleeding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, let\u2019s get inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTy, come on, quit screwing around,\u201d Zane said as he reached under the truck to grip Ty\u2019s arm. He pulled, but Ty didn\u2019t budge.</p><p>Ty met his eyes, the hazel looking a sickly gray in the firelight. \u201cMy cast is stuck on the undercarriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not funny, Ty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, Zane, it\u2019s not! Give me your knife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have it, it\u2019s in my carry-on bag. Where\u2019s yours?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s in an evidence bag!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoddammit, Ty!\u201d Zane tried tugging at him again, but Ty cried out and shoved at his hand.</p><p>\u201cGo get me a knife!\u201d</p><p>Zane handed him the shotgun and ran for the house. There were more gunshots, and the tiger was somewhere, roaring. He didn\u2019t have time to be confused, he was just reacting and hoping they could sort out the who and the why later. He ran for the kitchen, but almost toppled over his father as he pushed through the door.</p><p>\u201cDad!\u201d</p><p>\u201cZane!\u201d</p><p>Zane was shocked to see all the people in the kitchen\u2014at least twenty, some family, some guests of the party. Annie and Beverly huddled together in the banquette, pale and drawn. Harrison held a shotgun, as did at least five other employees of the ranch. Mark was there, a rifle in his hands and blood at his hairline.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Zane asked his dad. \u201cI told you to get upstairs!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we head up, we\u2019ll be trapped,\u201d Mark said, shouting over the noise.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Sadie?\u201d Annie screamed.</p><p>Zane shook his head, his eyes drawn back to Mark. If Mark wasn\u2019t behind it, then who the hell was? His stomach flipped. A blast sounded from the front of the house.</p><p>\u201cTy.\u201d Zane grabbed his dad\u2019s arm. \u201cDo you have a knife?\u201d</p><p>Harrison dug in his pocket and handed Zane his pocketknife. He followed Zane to the front door, where they both stopped and watched in horror as flames licked at the bed of the truck parked in the driveway. Glass broke somewhere in the house. Then another window smashed.</p><p>\u201cMolotov cocktails,\u201d Zane said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to set fire to the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI called the sheriff back. They were already halfway to Austin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll never get here in time.\u201d He shoved at his dad. \u201cGo get the others, we have to fight back or we\u2019ll be dead. I have to get Ty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStuck under the truck.\u201d</p><p>Zane took the steps two at a time and darted around the truck to dive to the gravel at Ty\u2019s side.</p><p>\u201cTruck\u2019s on fire, Zane,\u201d Ty said, sounding urgent but calm.</p><p>\u201cI see that, Ty,\u201d Zane said through gritted teeth. He handed Ty the knife.</p><p>\u201cWatch your six,\u201d Ty said, then disappeared further under the truck. When Zane turned and looked up, a 4x4 was thundering toward them. He raised the shotgun in his hands, knowing the birdshot would do nothing to slow down the truck but hoping to hit the driver. The truck skidded to a stop and Joe barreled out of the cab.</p><p>Zane lowered the shotgun.</p><p>\u201cI saw the fire,\u201d Joe stuttered when he realized Zane had almost shot him.</p><p>\u201cGot bigger problems than that.\u201d Zane knelt back down to peer under the truck.</p><p>A bullet hit the door, striking inches from his ear. He hit the dirt. \u201cJesus!\u201d</p><p>Another bullet impacted where his head had been.</p><p>\u201cZane, go!\u201d Ty yelled. \u201cHe\u2019s in the corral, get inside!\u201d</p><p>Zane and Joe scurried around the truck to the other side, putting it between them and the sniper in the corral. Zane looked under the truck to see Ty lying flat, sawing at the jagged piece of his cast that had caught on the undercarriage.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Ty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not exactly easy under here. How close is the fire to the gas tank?\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo close. Come on, baby.\u201d</p><p>Ty yanked at his arm, but his elbow just hit the ground. He couldn\u2019t find any leverage to get free, and the knife was small and dull.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not coming free.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Ty!\u201d</p><p>A shot pinged off the top of the truck.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Cody?\u201d Ty asked through gritted teeth.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were heading out to look for the cavern under the pump house when the gunfire started. They either shot him or he shot me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Joe shouted as he flattened to look under the truck as well.</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat cavern?\u201d Joe demanded, his voice going higher.</p><p>\u201cMark\u2019s inside, it\u2019s not him,\u201d Zane told Ty.</p><p>\u201cThen it\u2019s got to be Cody!\u201d Ty shouted. He yanked at his hand in frustration, to no avail.</p><p>Zane reached under the truck to see if he could help, but Ty was too far away. His fingers just barely grazed Ty\u2019s shoulder, and no matter how much he stretched, Zane couldn\u2019t grasp him. It was his worst fear come to life, watching helplessly as his lover struggled to get free.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you talking about?\u201d Joe demanded.</p><p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s been moving drugs on the ranch,\u201d Zane said through gritted teeth.</p><p>\u201cAnd you thought it was Mark?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not. But whoever it is has Sadie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you we should have cut this fucking thing off, Zane!\u201d Ty yelled, his voice cracking with frustration.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry!\u201d</p><p>There was a scream from inside.</p><p>\u201cGo, Zane,\u201d Ty urged as he continued sawing at the cast.</p><p>Zane was torn between staying there to cover Ty, and going inside to protect his family. He hesitated.</p><p>Ty turned his head, his eyes shadowed. \u201cGo, Zane! Go!\u201d</p><p>Zane stared at him for a frozen moment, then pushed off the ground and ran for the front door, Joe on his heels. Shots chased them up the steps. Pain seared through his thigh and he stumbled, pitching forward through the door. He rolled across the marble, a streak of blood following him. He grasped at the back of his leg and his hand came away bloody.</p><p>Joe kicked the door shut, then knelt with him and began yanking off his belt to staunch the flow of blood.</p><p>\u201cDad!\u201d Zane called out.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re okay!\u201d Harrison shouted back from somewhere in the recesses of the house. Several rooms in the middle of the house had no windows. They\u2019d be safe unless the house caught on fire.</p><p>Harrison and Mark hurried out of Harrison\u2019s study, both carrying a shotgun and a rifle, and Harrison knelt next to Zane as Joe pulled the belt tight around Zane\u2019s thigh. Zane shouted in pain, but Joe paid him no mind as he fastened it.</p><p>Harrison put his hand on Zane\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWhere you hit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeg. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a bullet or a ricochet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Grady?\u201d Mark asked as they helped Zane off the floor.</p><p>\u201cStuck under the truck. There\u2019s a sniper firing from the corral.\u201d</p><p>Harrison\u2019s grip tightened on Zane\u2019s arm. \u201cWhere\u2019s Cody?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe think he\u2019s in the corral,\u201d Zane said, voice tight.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Harrison and Mark both cried.</p><p>\u201cHold on, if Ty was with the tiger, and then Cody was with Ty, who has Sadie?\u201d Joe asked. He looked so distraught that his best friend might be behind this that even his mustache seemed to be drooping. His mind was still sharp though, and Zane could see anger and the embers of revenge starting to burn in his normally placid eyes.</p><p>Zane shook his head. He had no answer.</p><p>The fire in the barn was gaining power, roaring and crackling, and there were men outside shouting over the noise. It was impossible to make out what they were saying.</p><p>Zane pulled away from his dad and limped toward a window. He used the barrel of his rifle to push the lace curtain away and peered out. The truck was still on fire, the flames licking ever closer to the gas tank. Whether Ty was still under it or not was anyone\u2019s guess. Three men stood in the yard, shouting at the house. Why wasn\u2019t Ty firing from under the truck? He had the perfect vantage point.</p><p>As the fire grew stronger, it illuminated them. They all wore bandanas and hats to hide their faces, like old-time outlaws robbing a bank. One of them held Sadie in his arms. She had her head buried in his shoulder, grasping his neck for dear life.</p><p>Anger flooded Zane so fast and hot that his vision went white. Now he understood why Ty hadn\u2019t fired from his position under the truck.</p><p>\u201cMy baby,\u201d Mark whispered. The desperation in his voice tore at Zane\u2019s heart.</p><p>\u201cGarrett!\u201d Blue Bandana yelled over the sound of the fires burning.</p><p>\u201cYou recognize them?\u201d Zane asked his father.</p><p>Harrison shook his head. \u201cHard to say.\u201d</p><p>Zane looked from Sadie to the truck, his heart hammering away. He tried to decide how much time they had before the fire reached the gas tank and it blew, or before it reached the undercarriage and Ty.</p><p>\u201cWe just want to talk, Harrison!\u201d Red Bandana called out.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what the telephone is for, you bastards!\u201d Harrison shouted through the glass.</p><p>Zane grabbed him and yanked him away from the window, but the men outside didn\u2019t fire. Zane and the others pressed against the wall, waiting. There was movement outside, scuffling and talking and cursing. Every second they waited was a second Ty didn\u2019t have. And then there was Sadie.</p><p>A gunshot cracked, then another. Zane jumped with each one. When he glanced out the window, one of the men was at the truck. They\u2019d found Ty. Zane lurched toward the door, but Joe grabbed his shoulder to keep him from going out there. Another shot came from the truck, and then Blue Bandana stood and began pulling on one end of a lasso.</p><p>He dragged Ty out from under the truck. He may as well have grabbed a crab by the wrong end, though, because as soon as Ty was free of the undercarriage and sliding across the gravel on his back, he was fighting. He was also yelling at Sadie as the other two Bandanas fought to flatten him. Sadie lifted her head.</p><p>\u201cRun!\u201d Ty yelled. He made a gesture with his hand, jabbing at the air with two fingers before he disappeared under the other two men.</p><p>Sadie began to squirm, and the man in the black bandana struggled to hold her. She threw herself back like all children were apt to do when they were pitching a fit, going limp and trying to slither out of his arms. When she couldn\u2019t get loose, she mimicked the motion Ty had made, poking her little fingers into the pressure point at the man\u2019s neck, just as Ty had taught her. Black Bandana let her go and she dropped to the ground.</p><p>\u201cRun!\u201d Ty yelled, his voice muffled.</p><p>\u201cCome on, baby doll,\u201d Mark shouted. \u201cRun, baby!\u201d</p><p>Sadie crawled a few yards, then pushed to her feet and darted toward the house.</p><p>Mark dropped his gun and ran for the front door, yanking it open and leaping down the front steps in a single bound. In the driveway, Ty lurched to his feet and threw himself into the man with the shotgun, sending the shot wild and forfeiting his chance to get away in favor of covering Sadie\u2019s flight.</p><p>Mark grabbed her at the front of the burning truck and turned with her, shielding her from the gunfire and whisking her inside. Joe slammed the door behind them. A hail of bullets followed and they all took cover. Mark ducked out of the way with Sadie in his arms. There was more shouting from outside, and Zane knew without having to look that Ty was suffering for the little girl\u2019s escape. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sadie was sobbing. Relief washed over Zane as father and daughter clung to each other. Annie ran from the study and took Sadie out of Mark\u2019s arms. They retreated to the relative safety of a windowless room to huddle with Beverly and the stragglers from the party, and Mark crawled back to the window to pick up his gun. They weren\u2019t safe yet.</p><p>\u201cHey, Zane!\u201d one of the Bandanas called. \u201cZane, we got your little boyfriend out here! Get your daddy to come talk or we take it out on his pretty face!\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s breath caught. That meant Ty was still alive.</p> <p>\u201cAt least he\u2019s not under the burning truck anymore, right?\u201d Joe whispered.</p><p>Zane closed his eyes. His heart was racing and he had to take a few breaths to calm down.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go out there,\u201d Harrison said.</p><p>\u201cNo. No, I\u2019ll go. If it\u2019s you they want, they\u2019ll need to get through me first,\u201d Zane said. He nodded at Mark and Joe. \u201cCover my ass.\u201d</p><p>Mark nodded and traded the shotgun in his hands for Zane\u2019s rifle. Zane took a deep breath and opened the front door.</p> <p>The Three Bandanas were in the yard, using the flames from the truck as partial cover. Ty was on his knees in front of Blue Bandana, a shotgun held to the back of his head. His cast was gone, and the side of his face was bloody. In fact, he was bloody almost everywhere. A large stain was spreading at his ribcage where he\u2019d been shot, and more was flowing from his hairline.</p><p>Zane had to fight not to rush forward. \u201cWhat\u2019s this about?\u201d he called out, trying to keep his voice even and calm.</p><p>\u201cYou know how much money you cost us?\u201d</p><p>Zane shook his head, gritting his teeth as he stared at Ty.</p><p>\u201cYou found our stash, Zane. Ty told me. You were going to go expose us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d Zane called.</p> <p>\u201cBullshit! We were supposed to have it all moved by now, but with all this attention we couldn\u2019t risk it. We got nothing to show for it! The money and those damn cats were all supposed to be in Mexico tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Zane narrowed his eyes. The voice was familiar. \u201cCody?\u201d he said with a sinking feeling, realizing he hadn\u2019t truly believed it until now.</p><p>Cody reached up and yanked the blue bandana down. The others followed suit. Ronnie, another of Harrison\u2019s ranch hands who\u2019d ridden to the pump house with them, was behind the red bandana. Zane\u2019s knees went weak when his cousin Jamie pulled the black bandana off his face.</p><p>\u201cIt was you?\u201d he asked, barely able to get the words out. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said yourself, there were more than four,\u201d Cody said with a sneer.</p><p>Zane was breathless with shock and his mind was racing. It had been about drugs all along, but why? Like Ty said days ago, they were too far from the normal routes for it to make sense. Was this the first wave of some sort of cartel expansion? A chess move in a game being played hundreds of miles away? And what the hell did big cats have to do with any of it?</p><p>\u201cGuys . . . you\u2019re looking at a hell of lot more time if you go through with this than you would for selling drugs or poaching exotic animals.\u201d</p><p>Cody shook his head. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand, Zane! We got us a deal down in Laredo. He wants his money, and he wants his goddamned tigers. We don\u2019t deliver, we\u2019re dead men. He\u2019ll think we swindled him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll get life for this. Attempted murder. Hell, kidnapping, assault on a federal agent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll kill us anyway!\u201d Cody shouted, and he worked the action on the shotgun. Ty squeezed his eyes closed at the sound.</p><p>The rage and terror bubbled up and Zane snarled. \u201cYou hurt him, and I\u2019ll kill you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can try it, Zane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTy and I can help you get out of this. This isn\u2019t the way. Do you have any idea how many people are in this house?\u201d</p><p>Cody\u2019s eyes flickered to the house and he shook his head. \u201cWe don\u2019t want no one to come to harm, that\u2019s why we want to talk.\u201d</p><p>Zane eyes were drawn back to Ty. All color had drained from his face. He was losing too much blood. The only thing holding him upright was the lasso around his neck, but he raised his head and met Zane\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Zane asked Cody.</p><p>\u201cWe want the money,\u201d Jamie called out. \u201cWhat Uncle Harry\u2019s got in that big safe of his. It\u2019s the only way we can get out from under the man we owe. Get Uncle Harry out here or Cody blows Ty\u2019s brains out.\u201d</p><p>Zane swallowed hard and met Ty\u2019s eyes once more. It didn\u2019t even take a moment\u2019s thought. He half-turned toward the door, but Harrison stepped out and onto the porch with him.</p><p>\u201cBoys,\u201d Harrison called in a deep voice that carried well over the yard. \u201cThis ain\u2019t the way to go about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour meddling is going to cost us our lives,\u201d Ronnie shouted.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019d have gotten away with it too!\u201d Ty said, his words almost slurred and sounding half-delirious. \u201cIf it hadn\u2019t been for you meddling kids.\u201d</p><p>Cody put his boot on Ty\u2019s back and then jerked on the lasso. Ty arched, reaching up to grasp the rope before it could cut off his air.</p><p>\u201cShut your damn mouth!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive us the money to pay off what we owe,\u201d Jamie told Harrison. \u201cWe disappear. Stuart and his boys take the fall for the poaching and the drugs. Nobody gets hurt. If you don\u2019t, we burn it to the ground.\u201d</p><p>Zane eyed his father. Harrison glanced at him, meeting his eyes. It seemed a clear-cut decision. It was only money, after all. Money for the lives inside the house was simple.</p><p>Harrison nodded at the men in the yard. \u201cI say yes, you know you can push me around. You\u2019ll keep coming back and taking and threatening until I\u2019m dead and buried and got nothing but disgrace to my name. I don\u2019t need money. But I ain\u2019t giving you my pride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad,\u201d Zane whispered, both impressed with his father and terrified that they were going to shoot his lover in the head as he watched.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, Zane,\u201d he whispered, and then, to the men outside, \u201cYou boys burn down the house, you only hurt yourselves. My money\u2019ll burn down with it, and then what will you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUncle Harry, think about this!\u201d Jamie shouted.</p><p>\u201cI ain\u2019t your uncle, boy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d Cody snarled. He raised the barrel to the back of Ty\u2019s head.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Zane shouted, panic and rage blinding him as he lunged for the stairs. Harrison grabbed him.</p><p>Glass broke as Mark took advantage of the distraction to bust the window with the butt of his rifle.</p><p>Ty jerked his head to the side and rolled, kicking the barrel of the shotgun and knocking it aside. It went off as Ty tackled Cody to the ground. Ten feet away, Jamie was knocked to his back, screaming and bloody.</p><p>Ronnie raised his gun and Harrison pulled Zane back inside as the man fired at them. The birdshot didn\u2019t even reach the porch at that distance. Harrison slammed the front door as Ronnie switched guns.</p><p>Mark and Joe took aim and fired in return, trying to cover Ty as he wrestled with Cody in the yard and trying to deter Ronnie from peppering the house with his .45.</p><p>\u201cDad, go get the girls and get to your truck!\u201d Mark shouted between shots. \u201cGet everyone out the back!\u201d</p><p>Harrison looked to Zane, and Zane nodded. Harrison moved away to retrieve Beverly, Annie, and Sadie and get them to safety. Zane peered around the windowsill to see how Ty was faring. He and Cody were scuffling in the dirt, but despite the covering fire, Ronnie was wading in. Ty was an injured man with one good arm and a rope already around his neck, fighting two healthy men. And he was losing. Badly.</p><p>Zane took the rifle Harrison had readied and took aim, standing above Mark and looking through the sights at Ronnie as the big man grabbed Ty and held him. Cody pulled a knife from a sheath at his thigh.</p><p>Zane let out a breath and pulled the trigger. Ty jerked in Ronnie\u2019s arms and turned both their bodies. The bullet went through Ronnie\u2019s arm and he howled, and Ty cried out too as they both hit the ground.</p><p>Cody dove to the gravel and all three men were out of sight.</p><p>\u201cDid you just shoot your boyfriend?\u201d Mark cried.</p><p>\u201cFuck!\u201d</p><p>Joe and Mark both grabbed an extra gun and darted for the door, on Zane\u2019s heels. Harrison had returned and followed them onto the porch. They were just in time to see Cody get to his feet and grab up a revolver from the grass. He pointed it down at Ty, who was writhing in the dirt, holding his arm where Zane\u2019s shot had hit him.</p><p>Zane raised his rifle.</p><p>The others all cried out before Zane could pull the trigger. He caught a flash of orange out of the corner of his eye: Barnum the Bengal tiger speeding across the yard toward Ty and the others.</p><p>\u201cTy!\u201d</p><p>Ty rolled and saw the tiger coming. He curled into a ball as Barnum rushed him. The tiger leapt over him, claws extended, graceful body long and lean as he attacked. Cody screamed and fired his gun, but the tiger hit him at full force, sending him skidding through the gravel a solid ten feet away.</p><p>Claws slashed and teeth sank into flesh. Cody screamed, a bloodcurdling sound that Zane didn\u2019t think he\u2019d soon be forgetting.</p><p>Zane sprinted across the yard toward Ty, who was still curled in a ball with his arms covering his head. He grabbed Ty\u2019s arm and yanked him to his feet.</p><p>Ty wavered, but seemed to rally as Zane wrapped his arm around him. \u201cSomebody shot me, Zane.\u201d</p><p>Zane nodded and pulled the rope off Ty\u2019s neck. He shoved him toward the porch, then bent to check Ronnie\u2019s pulse. The man was alive, but he wasn\u2019t moving. Zane gathered all his weapons, then left him to lie there, unconscious and defenseless, at the mercy of the enraged tiger.</p><p>He turned to follow his partner, but Ty was rooted to the spot, watching Barnum savage the ranch hand who had tried to kill him. Zane couldn\u2019t bring himself to look.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Ty,\u201d Zane whispered. He tugged at Ty\u2019s arm.</p><p>Ty shook his head, then he gave a short whistle. \u201cBarnum!\u201d</p><p>The tiger jerked his head up and growled. Ty and Zane both staggered back as if it had been a warning. Ty stopped his retreat, though, and said the tiger\u2019s name again with a little more authority. Zane couldn\u2019t help but glance sideways at the animal. Barnum had Cody\u2019s hand in his mouth, and the arm was obviously broken and possibly beyond repair. There were gashes and punctures all over his body, but nothing like the damage the tiger could have done.</p><p>\u201cEasy now. Come on,\u201d Ty said to the tiger, and after a moment Barnum released Cody\u2019s hand and began to prowl toward Ty. Zane started backing away.</p><p>Ty held his hand out, breathing out like he was trying to calm himself. His hand was trembling. Barnum approached and nosed his bloody muzzle against Ty\u2019s palm. Ty carefully scratched under his chin \u201cThat\u2019s twice you saved me. Good boy.\u201d</p><p>Barnum chuffed and then pushed onto his back feet, putting one huge paw on each of Ty\u2019s shoulders. Ty couldn\u2019t take the weight of the 600 pound tiger and they both toppled to the ground. Barnum sat down with a huff and rubbed his face against Ty\u2019s as Ty gasped for air. Then he wrapped his paw around Ty\u2019s head and began licking Ty\u2019s wounded face. Ty didn\u2019t struggle, merely closed his eyes and held his breath.</p><p>\u201cTy?\u201d Zane whispered.</p><p>\u201cJust go get someone with a tranquilizer gun please,\u201d Ty said in a soothing, almost sing-song voice. \u201cSlowly.\u201d</p><p>Zane backed away, watching in fascination as the tiger lay down in the grass and rested his chin on Ty\u2019s stomach. Mark had already retrieved Annie, and she was readying her tranquilizer gun even as Zane reached the porch.</p><p>They tossed out the meat that had been thawing for the BBQ to lure Barnum away from Ty, and as soon as Ty was out of his reach, Annie shot the dart. They had to wait only a minute or two before the tiger was out.</p><p>Ty sat down beside him and laid a hand on his head as everyone else surveyed the damage. Harrison\u2019s men and several of the party guests who\u2019d been caught in the house rushed to the barn to try to contain the fire. Minutes later, they could hear the police cars and fire trucks approaching, sirens blazing. Tish and several interns from the Roaring Springs Sanctuary arrived ten minutes after the police to take possession of Barnum and return him to the sanctuary.</p><p>Zane thought Ty might cry as they loaded Barnum into the truck.</p><p>\u201cWill they have to put him down since he attacked someone?\u201d Ty asked the sheriff as the Roaring Springs truck ambled down the drive.</p><p>The sheriff glanced at Cody\u2019s ravaged body and shook his head. \u201cLooks like he got hit by a truck to me. Ain\u2019t that what happened, son?\u201d</p><p>Ty stared at him, eyes wide. Then he nodded. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. A very angry truck,\u201d the sheriff drawled as he walked away.</p><p>The ambulance arrived a full twenty minutes after it had been called. By then, Cody had lost a good deal of blood and gone into shock. Annie refused to treat him, saying that the Hippocratic oath didn\u2019t extend to vets or to people who shot guns at her baby girl.</p><p>Zane couldn\u2019t blame her.</p><p>Ronnie and Cody would both live, though Cody would likely lose an arm and a few non-essential organs. Jamie had bled out from the shotgun blast to the chest, dying long before help could get to him. Zane suffered a pang of remorse over the death of his cousin, but he didn\u2019t waste much effort in mourning a man who\u2019d been willing to kill them all just for money.</p><p>The man in Laredo, and the question of why the drug trade had veered so far off its course, were both large problems. They weren\u2019t Zane\u2019s problems, though, and even if he wanted to be involved, it wasn\u2019t his jurisdiction. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Joe was horrified and crushed by the whole affair. Cody had been his best friend. Zane felt sorry for him, even though he was more relieved to find that Joe\u2019d had nothing to do with any of it.</p><p>Beverly sat on the porch swing with a shawl wrapped around her shoulders, staring. They had checked her for shock and deemed her in good health, then left her to sit there.</p><p>Zane eased into the seat beside her, watching the commotion in the yard in silence for a few seconds. Ty was sitting on the porch steps, his shirt gone, his arm in a sling, and his ribs patched up until they could get him to the hospital. Mark and Joe flanked him. The three of them appeared to simply be sitting there in dazed silence. Sadie perched between Ty and Mark, babbling as they nodded in response. She wasn\u2019t at all fazed, and she was recounting the events of the night as if it\u2019d been a movie she\u2019d watched rather than a terrifying experience she had lived through.</p> <p>Zane knew one thing for damn sure: he would never make fun of Ty again for teaching a toddler how to jab a pressure point.</p><p>Annie and Harrison stood with the sheriff, relating what had happened, and many of the party guests had filtered back toward the house to tell their versions as well. The local press had not been allowed onto the property, but Zane knew they would all be loitering down at the gate. It wouldn\u2019t be long before they got the story.</p><p>Beverly turned her head and Zane met her gaze. It was excruciating to look into her eyes and see nothing there but that emotionless mask hiding what she truly thought and felt. Zane never intended to inflict that kind of pain on Ty again.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to say,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cHow about \u2018good job\u2019? Or \u2018thank you\u2019? How about telling me Ty\u2019s a good man and you\u2019re happy for me?\u201d</p> <p>Beverly stared for long minutes. Zane tried to find some hint of emotion in her icy blue eyes, but there was nothing there. She nodded curtly and looked away, holding her chin high, stubborn and proper as ever.</p><p>Zane sighed as the cold settled in his chest. Beverly had never known anything but ranches. Like frontierswomen before her, protecting the homestead was first and foremost, even if it meant sacrificing the things they loved. She was still doing that, protecting her ranch and her family\u2019s legacy. She had simply lost sight of what her family meant.</p><p>He looked down at the bandage wrapped around his thigh. The bullet had gone straight through, narrowly missing an artery. He\u2019d been lucky and would only be limping for a while. Ty had fared much worse, all for the sake of Zane\u2019s family.</p><p>He nodded, looking over at Beverly one last time. \u201cGood-bye, Mother,\u201d he murmured before standing and limping away.</p><p>Ty and Zane spent most of Sunday night, Monday, and the majority of Tuesday in the hospital. Each of them had several bags of IV fluids pumped into them, and when Zane heard a commotion down the hall, he knew that someone had just ordered a new cast put on Ty\u2019s hand. Since Ty had lost a lot of blood and had nowhere to run, Zane was fairly certain he\u2019d wind up in another cast.</p><p>Wednesday was almost worse than the hospital\u2014from which Ty had checked himself out early, against medical advice\u2014spent filling out official statements. Ty cursed and muttered the entire time they sat in the barely air-conditioned trailer that served as the sheriff\u2019s outpost for the ranch community. The sheriff had offered to come to them, but Zane knew Ty wouldn\u2019t make a very credible witness while still confined to a hospital bed.</p> <p>After some intense questioning, one of the Cactus Creek hands had revealed where the stolen tigers were being kept. Tish and her people had already transported the other three tigers back to their homes. Barnum had been deemed a hero by several local news stations, and Ty and Zane were both in a hurry to get out of town before the national press caught wind of the story.</p><p>The sheriff\u2019s deputies had gone with Harrison to the pump house, and after a little searching they\u2019d found an entrance to the underground system of caverns carved in the limestone. The river that had been the source of the spring was still trickling; it had merely dug deeper as it beat through the soft stone.</p><p>Within the caverns, they found hundreds of thousands of dollars\u2019 worth of cocaine.</p><p>Zane knew Laredo was controlled by the Gulf cartel, the same cartel that had dealings with Colombia, Venezuela, and Brazil. The tenuous connection to his work in Miami was frightening, as was the mystery of why that much product had been shipped so far into the Hill Country. He left the sheriff and the San Antonio field office with enough information to watch over the connection in case it wasn\u2019t a coincidence.</p><p>When they were finally able to leave the sheriff\u2019s office, all that was left for them to do was tell Zane\u2019s family good-bye and go home.</p><p>Chapter 11</p><p>Harrison dismounted and wrapped his horse\u2019s lead around the deck railing, then pulled a large manila envelope out of the saddlebag before he walked across the stone pavers toward the guesthouse. Zane chewed on the inside of his lip as he watched from the kitchen window.</p><p>Beverly hadn\u2019t changed her mind after the attack on the ranch, too stubborn and too proud to admit that she might have been wrong. Or the alternative: she didn\u2019t think she was wrong at all. If Harrison supported Beverly\u2019s decision to write him out of the will and essentially out of the family . . . Zane shook himself, not even able to think about it.</p> <p>\u201cHey,\u201d Harrison said, voice gruff.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d Zane\u2019s wounded thigh pulled as he held himself straight and tall.</p><p>Harrison shook his head and reached out to pat Zane\u2019s shoulder. \u201cRelax, son,\u201d he said.</p><p>Zane thought he might drop in relief right there. He swallowed hard and nodded, stepping back to let Harrison into the house.</p><p>Harrison walked to the kitchen table and dropped the envelope onto it. \u201cYou two doing okay?\u201d</p><p>Zane glanced up the stairs to the loft. \u201cYeah. Ty hit the bed and fell asleep before I could make him take his boots off. He lost a lot of blood.\u201d</p><p>Harrison pursed his lips, which made his mustache twitch. Zane smiled fondly. \u201cGot a little time?\u201d Harrison asked.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got another hour or so until we need to go to catch the plane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad I came right over, then. Sit down, Z. We need to talk.\u201d</p><p>The apprehension hit Zane again like a hammer. He edged into one of the chairs, babying his leg.</p><p>Harrison sat opposite him, drumming his fingers on the tabletop. \u201cI\u2019m proud of you, son. What you did was damned brave.\u201d</p><p>The words warmed Zane to his toes. \u201cI could say the same of you. I never realized how lucky I was to have you as a role model.\u201d</p><p>Harrison raised an eyebrow, and his mustache twitched again.</p><p>Zane grinned. \u201cThank you for teaching me how to stand my ground, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGarretts got iron in their spines. You remember that.\u201d</p><p>Zane nodded.</p><p>\u201cWhat your mother\u2019s done is a terrible thing, Z, and I won\u2019t excuse her for it.\u201d He sighed and shook his head. \u201cNot that it matters much to her what I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad, what happened to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s always been a person who saw things in black and white, Z. Either it\u2019s good for business, or it ain\u2019t. You must remember what that felt like.\u201d</p><p>Pain shot through Zane\u2019s chest. He did remember. It had been a cold world. The only people who\u2019d ever been able to see through his own icy exterior had been Becky and Ty. Was his father able to do the same with his mother?</p><p>\u201cAre you happy, Dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always have been.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe love of my life is my ranch, Zane. It\u2019s all I need to be happy. Beverly runs the money side of it and she\u2019s good at it. I run the people side. Horses run themselves.\u201d</p><p>Zane nodded, finally seeing a glimpse of the real marriage between the two of them. He didn\u2019t understand it, but he believed his dad when he said he was happy. He stared out the glass wall over the rolling hills, seeing nothing but blurry grass and trying to ignore the awful, hollow feeling in his chest.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t put my nose into her side of the business, and she leaves her opinions out of mine. But this is one decision she won\u2019t be making alone. I won\u2019t allow it to tear my family to pieces.\u201d</p><p>Zane blinked at him in shock.</p><p>\u201cIf she wants to take the Carter name and all that goes with it from you, she can.\u201d He reached out and clasped Zane\u2019s shoulder. \u201cBut you\u2019ll always be a Garrett. Nothing she does or says can ever change that.\u201d</p><p>Zane nodded, blinking against the stinging in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cNow, when you were born, your granddaddy set up the Garrett Ranch in a revocable living trust,\u201d Harrison said, his grip on Zane\u2019s shoulder loosening. \u201cI\u2019m the successor trustee, so I\u2019ve run the Garrett Ranch right along with the Carter Ranch ever since your granddaddy passed. But they\u2019re still two completely separate entities.\u201d</p><p>Zane frowned. \u201cSo you own the Garrett Ranch separate from the Carter Ranch?\u201d</p><p>A smile played around the corners of Harrison\u2019s mouth. \u201cNo, Zane. You own the Garrett Ranch.\u201d</p><p>Zane stared at Harrison, his mind gone blank. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou own it. You\u2019re the beneficiary of the trust.\u201d</p><p>Zane shook himself. \u201cThat\u2019s not possible. There would have been paperwork.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh there is, and there has been since you were a baby. Trust takes care of itself,\u201d Harrison said as he pushed the envelope under Zane\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cI own . . . own half the ranch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Garrett half. The Carter half was originally Garrett land, deeded to the Carters when we married as a dowry. Your mother inherited it and it folded back into the Garrett Ranch. Now, if something like, say, divorce papers got filed, the Carter half would revert back into the Garrett name, and that half is in my name alone. Beverly would walk away with nothing.\u201d</p><p>Zane gaped, unable to say anything.</p><p>Harrison smirked. \u201cWe Garretts, we may be a lot of things, but we ain\u2019t stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, Beverly knows all that, and she knows if she raises a hand against you, or speaks against Ty as long as you\u2019re with him, I got no need for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo . . . I own the Garrett half, and you own the Carter half?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Meaning, one day, you\u2019ll own the whole thing.\u201d</p><p>Zane opened his mouth to speak, but failed. He\u2019d never had any inkling the Garrett half of the ranch was the ranch in power. His mother always ruled the roost as if her family\u2019s money fed it. It made sense now, all those years of her heavy-handed ways; she was compensating for having no monetary importance in the alliance of the families. Harrison\u2019s mellow temperament made it easy for her to control things, and her savvy business sense had made it a good arrangement.</p><p>Now, though, Harrison was flexing his muscle. And it was a lot of muscle.</p><p>\u201cDad,\u201d Zane whispered. He shook his head.</p><p>\u201cYour granddaddy wanted you to have it, wanted you to know you had a place, no matter what.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Annie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe left a significant cash inheritance for her. And I\u2019ll do the same when I pass. She and Mark used it to set up her vet business. But the ranch follows the Garrett name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d</p><p>Harrison sighed and leaned back in the chair. \u201cI wanted you to live the life you wanted, Z. Texas held more bad memories for you than good. Becky was gone, Beverly wouldn\u2019t leave you alone, and I knew here was the last place you wanted to be. But if you\u2019d found out, you would have dropped it all and come back here, no matter how miserable it made you in the end, simply because it was your granddaddy\u2019s doing.\u201d</p><p>Zane inhaled sharply, trying to swallow down the swell of emotion. \u201cYeah. You\u2019re probably right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell. Now you know. The Garrett Ranch, and the Garrett name, are yours to do with what you will. The envelope\u2019s got copies of all the legal paperwork, banking information and so on, but there\u2019s really nothing you have to do. Beverly and I got it all set up to sustain itself and then some. I just need a few new hands, is all. Just like Cody.\u201d</p><p>Zane laughed in surprise at his father\u2019s rueful words.</p><p>Harrison winced. \u201cToo soon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, well. Three-quarters of profits are folded back into operations, the other quarter splits into three accounts: one for Annie, one for Sadie, and one for you to do whatever you want with.\u201d</p><p>They sat in silence for long minutes while Zane tried to let it sink in.</p><p>\u201cWhat about you, Dad?\u201d he finally asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf the Garrett Ranch is mine, and Mother is . . . what do you have?\u201d Zane was sure there were more questions to ask, but that one loomed large.</p><p>Harrison waved a hand. \u201cWhat do I need when I\u2019m running the place anyway? I got a son and daughter who love me. I got a grandbaby whose eyelashes are going to take over the world someday. And I have my horses.\u201d He leaned forward and covered Zane\u2019s hand with his own. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about me, Z.\u201d</p><p>Zane laughed despite himself. \u201cAnd I thought I was a stubborn ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou come by it honest.\u201d Harrison sighed and patted Zane\u2019s hand a couple times, and then glanced up at the loft. Zane could hear the topic change coming a mile away. Harrison met his eyes and smiled. \u201cYou hang onto him with everything you\u2019ve got. Not every man gets a second chance.\u201d</p><p>Zane eyes strayed to the loft, where Ty probably still lay sprawled on the bed. Zane smiled as the warmth of contentment spread through him. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>They lucked into plane tickets that took a short hop from Austin to Houston, and then carried on in a single leg to Charleston, West Virginia. Zane even upgraded himself and Ty into first class. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They both looked like they\u2019d been dragged behind a tractor, and trudging through the airport in Houston didn\u2019t help either of them. As they sat waiting for the connection, they watched the local news about the heroic tiger outside of Austin and sank lower in their seats. After the news story was over, the man beside Ty joked about his bandages, asking him if he\u2019d been mauled by a tiger too.</p><p>Ty managed a smile as the stranger chuckled, then gave Zane a look that said if they didn\u2019t move he was going to end up with blood on his hands.</p><p>The rest of the flight home was uneventful. It was dark and quiet as Zane drove up the last mountain road before they got to the Grady\u2019s winding driveway.</p> <p>Ty kept glancing over at him, as if he wanted to ask if he was okay but already knew the answer. He gave Zane directions instead. Zane pulled the rental beside the old truck in the gravel driveway and turned off the car. They sat in the darkness, the engine clicking as the silence settled over them.</p><p>Ty cleared his throat. \u201cShould we tell them about the shooting and violence and tigers, or just stick to the basics?\u201d</p><p>Zane rubbed his thigh. He could feel bruises and strained muscles all over his body, little bangs and cuts that you never noticed when you were scrambling for dear life. Ty looked and probably felt even worse. Zane sighed and pointed at Ty\u2019s brand new cast and the sling he now wore because of the gunshot to his shoulder. \u201cThey\u2019ll figure it out anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlrighty,\u201d Ty said. He unbuckled, but stopped and glanced at Zane again before getting out of the car. \u201cTell me something, Zane.\u201d</p><p>Zane stared at him in the darkness, wallowing in the relief of simply being with Ty. \u201cAnything.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWas it you or Mark who shot me?\u201d</p><p>Zane bit his lip, trying not to smile. \u201cTotally Mark.\u201d</p><p>Ty narrowed his eyes. Then he smiled and leaned over for a quick kiss. Zane couldn\u2019t help but laugh. He had a feeling Ty knew he was lying. It was one lie he didn\u2019t mind paying for later.</p><p>Ty lingered over the kiss for another moment, then pressed their foreheads together. Calm settled over Zane, and then Ty pulled away and slid out of the car. As soon as the car door shut, the porch light came on and the front door of the house opened.</p><p>Zane waited for the anxiety to strike, but it never came. He was happy to be here, and the relief was overwhelming. Even the uneasiness between himself and Earl didn\u2019t register as important anymore.</p><p>He opened the door to climb out of the car, stifling a groan as the stitches in his thigh pulled.</p> <p>Earl stood on the top step. \u201cYou boys look like something the cat dragged in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe cat jokes lost their luster a while ago, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot \u2019round here they didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait \u2019til he hears about the tiger,\u201d Zane muttered.</p><p>Ty laughed, not even trying to stop himself. Zane grinned, falling victim to Ty\u2019s infectious laughter and beginning to chuckle. Suddenly, it all seemed funny.</p><p>Ty was still snickering as he trudged up the steps. Earl offered his hand to Ty in greeting, but Ty bypassed it and hugged his father instead. Earl looked shocked for a moment, but he hastily returned it, gingerly patting Ty on the back at first, and then truly embracing his son.</p><p>Zane merely smiled as he watched. Mara came out just as Ty let Earl go, and she shouldered past Earl and pulled Ty into another hug. Ty gave a pitiful cry as she grabbed his arm.</p><p>\u201cOh my good gracious, what happened?\u201d She took Ty\u2019s face in her hands, then turned her sharp eyes to Zane. \u201cYou too! What did you do to yourselves?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust a little scuffle,\u201d Zane said as he dropped his bag on the front step and turned back to the car for Ty\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cZane Garrett, you get back here and give me a hug!\u201d Mara called after him. \u201cEarl, get their bags.\u201d</p><p>Zane spun in place and returned to the porch, a little bemused by how he reacted to her orders without thinking. \u201cWe\u2019re fine,\u201d he said as she pulled him down into a tight hug. It was still awkward for him, but he was beginning to realize just how special it was.</p><p>\u201cBoth of you are liars,\u201d Mara grumbled, though her voice was affectionate. \u201cCome on in and tell us what happened. We wasn\u2019t expecting you back.\u201d She turned and led them into the house, where they could smell something with cinnamon cooking. Mara hooked her arms through both of theirs and dragged them into the house.</p><p>The smell of cinnamon was stronger in the kitchen. Mara pointed them toward the table and then sat across from them. \u201cWhat happened in Texas?\u201d</p><p>Zane met Ty\u2019s eyes, wondering what Ty wanted to tell them. Zane wanted to tell them every word of it. He wanted to speak it to someone who would understand and give him a hug to make it better.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Ty started out, glancing at Zane and then looking at his mother carefully. Zane could see his gears turning. \u201cThere were guns. And tigers. And horses, Ma, the horses were horrible. And basically, people wanted to kill us. Well, not us specifically, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right!\u201d Mara interrupted, waving her hand at Ty. She turned to Zane and pointed her finger at him. \u201cHe\u2019s too full of bologna. You tell me.\u201d</p><p>Zane released a sigh and smiled. Chester ambled in and took a seat, looking them both over but not commenting on their injuries. Earl joined them, and they gathered around the table as Zane related the entire story from beginning to end.</p><p>When he was done, it was nearing dusk. Mara stared at Zane for a long moment, then shifted her eyes to Ty suspiciously.</p><p>\u201cAnd you thought I was lying,\u201d Ty said, clearly satisfied. He pointed at the breadbox and stood. \u201cIs that cinnamon bread? Is it warm?\u201d</p><p>He turned toward the counter and Mara started fussing at him not to touch anything in her kitchen, leaving Zane at the table without further questioning. Surprised and grateful, Zane let out a long, slow breath and relaxed back in his chair as he watched mother and son verbally spar.</p><p>Earl\u2019s hand came to rest on Zane\u2019s shoulder, drawing his attention. Zane tensed as he turned to look at him, expecting the worst.</p><p>\u201cYou okay, boy?\u201d Earl asked softly.</p><p>Zane blinked rapidly to cover the surprise and gave a curt nod. Then he shook his head. \u201cNo, sir.\u201d</p><p>Earl nodded and gave his shoulder a brief squeeze. \u201cYou will be.\u201d</p><p>He left it at that, and Zane found the words and his simple delivery oddly comforting.</p><p>He sat back and observed the Gradys, finding it soothing. Eventually Chester shambled off to bed, and Earl and Ty left the kitchen under the auspices of checking the roof they\u2019d rebuilt.</p><p>Zane found himself alone with Mara. She sat across from him and narrowed her eyes before talking. \u201cNow I know Ty ain\u2019t exactly diligent about it, so I\u2019m telling you. You need to know I expect certain things from my boys.\u201d</p><p>Zane raised an eyebrow. He wasn\u2019t certain he could stand another lecture from a disapproving mother. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe do Christmas, Thanksgiving, and sunrise service at Easter. If you have to go to Texas for some of those, that\u2019s just fine, but I expect a phone call. Chester\u2019s birthday is in April, and do not bring him anything that fires projectiles or is sharp. Or, God forbid, sharp projectiles. Understand? Because Ty does it every year.\u201d</p><p>Zane blinked. He wasn\u2019t quite sure where this was going, or why she was telling him instead of scolding Ty about it. \u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay then.\u201d She nodded and sat back. \u201cNow, there\u2019s supposed to be a cold snap coming, so be a doll and go out back and get some firewood for me, would you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d Zane said, bemused.</p><p>He pushed open the creaky screen door and stepped outside into the cool night, lit by a half moon and a ton of stars above him. He limped to the woodpile and looked up at the sky to let it sink in that Mara meant it when she\u2019d said \u201cmy boys.\u201d Including him.</p><p>It was more than he had any right to hope for, but he realized that deep down, he\u2019d wanted to come here for exactly that reason.</p><p>A soft whistle from above cut into his thoughts, and when he looked up from the woodpile to investigate, he saw Ty and Earl both sitting on the new roof of the outbuilding, legs dangling over the edge. They were sharing one of Ty\u2019s cigars. And they were laughing at him.</p><p>\u201cShe sent you out for firewood?\u201d Ty called, incredulous.</p><p>\u201cShe said there was a cold snap coming.\u201d</p><p>Ty\u2019s infectious laughter rang out in the night, accompanied by Earl\u2019s deeper chuckling. \u201cZane! It\u2019s July!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s the mountains!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s still July!\u201d</p><p>Zane shrugged and waved them off, resisting the urge to gesture rudely. He realized what Mara was doing: distracting him while making him feel like part of the family instead of a guest. It had worked.</p><p>Earl still chuckled as he got to his feet. He began to slide along the new roof, heading toward the hill and the precarious way down. His voice carried in the night. \u201cShe thinks I\u2019m building a fire in the middle of July, she\u2019s off her rocker.\u201d</p><p>Ty remained on the edge of the roof. Zane balanced the small stack of wood on his hip and walked up to him, able to return his lover\u2019s smile without any added weight to his heart. Zane\u2019s home was with Ty, even if he was sitting on a rickety tin roof framed by the smoky light of a summer moon.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you get up there?\u201d Zane asked.</p><p>\u201cEither stupidity or codeine, I\u2019m not sure,\u201d Ty answered amidst a blue ring of smoke.</p><p>\u201cShould I call you Juliet or Rapunzel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat which we call a rose.\u201d The genteel words were so unexpected, uttered in Ty\u2019s low, gravelly voice, Zane couldn\u2019t help the shiver that ran through him. Ty leaned forward and smirked. \u201cAre you ready to go home, my love?\u201d</p><p>Zane bit his lip and nodded. \u201cI\u2019m ready for anything.\u201d</p><p>Ty\u2019s grin was slow and mischievous. \u201cI certainly hope so.\u201d</p><p>When Ty pushed through the door of their row house, the first thing he did was make the hissing noise to call for Smith and Wesson.</p><p>Zane shook his head. He would just have to come to terms with the fact that he would always play second fiddle to killer felines.</p><p>\u201cOh God, it\u2019s good to be home,\u201d Ty said with a groan as he eased himself onto the couch and sprawled. Zane sat next to him with a sigh. They were both so banged up it was nearly impossible to do anything but lean against each other. Ty pressed his lips to Zane\u2019s temple. \u201cYou want to talk about it?\u201d</p><p>Zane stared at the room around them. They\u2019d already made so many memories here, some of them stored in photos and trinkets, others only residing in Zane\u2019s mind. It was a life he\u2019d never expected to have, colorful and easy and bright. He shook his head. \u201cI just keep wondering . . . would I have been like her? If Becky hadn\u2019t died, if you hadn\u2019t . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cZane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould I have turned into her, Ty? Would that have been me?\u201d</p><p>Ty wrapped his arm around Zane\u2019s shoulders and ran his fingers through his hair. \u201cI don\u2019t know, Zane. There are . . . there are so many paths in life. Some we choose, and some are chosen for us. We walk our paths without looking down and that\u2019s the life we lead. The only things you\u2019ll get from guessing where another path would have gone are questions you can\u2019t answer and heartache you can\u2019t ever soothe.\u201d</p><p>Zane met Ty\u2019s eyes, gazing at him as a sense of calm seeped into his bones. He smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re like a damn walking fortune cookie, you know that?\u201d</p><p>Ty smiled, and Zane kissed him. He was right; it was good to be home.</p><p>Ty broke the kiss with a gasp when it got too heated for his injuries. He hummed and cocked his head. \u201cDo you hear the cats?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, actually.\u201d</p><p>Ty sat up and called for Smith and Wesson again, then got up and headed for the stairs, looking up and frowning. Usually when the door opened, the cats came running. If it was Ty, they would swarm his legs, rubbing against him, purring so loudly they seemed to vibrate the floor. If it was Zane, they would both sit down to stare at him disapprovingly. They would watch him as he moved around the house, growling or hissing if he came too close to one of Ty\u2019s things, and they wouldn\u2019t leave him unattended until Ty got home.</p><p>It was odd that they hadn\u2019t come when Ty\u2019d called the first time. Even more so that they\u2019d allowed Zane to cuddle with Ty on the couch for that long without trying to bleed him dry.</p><p>Ty headed for the basement door, but he stopped short when he passed the kitchen counter. He picked up a manila envelope and his breath caught.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Zane asked. He stood and followed. A sense of dread settled in the pit of his stomach as he watched Ty\u2019s expression fall.</p><p>Ty shook his head and cleared his throat. \u201cIt\u2019s from Cross. He says thanks for watching his boys. He came and got them.\u201d Ty pressed his lips together hard as he read the rest of the note.</p><p>\u201cOh, Ty,\u201d Zane said as he moved closer. He put his arm around Ty\u2019s shoulder and hugged him. He had dreaded this day, knowing it would break Ty\u2019s heart when those stupid, scheming, evil cats were gone.</p><p>Ty nodded, still looking at the note on the envelope. Zane thought he might be fighting back tears. First, he\u2019d had to leave Barnum behind, and now Smith and Wesson were gone too.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s inside?\u201d Zane whispered.</p><p>Ty shook his head and handed the package to Zane. Zane squeezed his shoulder before taking it and reading the rest. Cross\u2019s note was longer than the original he\u2019d scribbled when he\u2019d left Smith and Wesson and a bowl of cat food in Ty\u2019s kitchen. The prose was odd and stilted, but it didn\u2019t strike Zane as unusual for Julian Cross. That was the way the man spoke. He\u2019d thanked them for treating the cats well, wished them both the best in life, and apologized for taking so long. He ended by saying, \u201cNice car.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Zane looked out the window of the back door, frowning. \u201cNice car,\u201d he said, beginning to smile. His father had made good on his promise to have the Mustang delivered to Baltimore. That would ease some of Ty\u2019s distress.</p><p>He opened the package from Cross and slid the contents onto the counter. A picture frame slid out. It matched the frames on Ty\u2019s walls perfectly, down to the color and style of the matting. In it was a photograph of the two massive orange cats, green eyes staring at the camera like they could burn a hole through the lens.</p><p>Ty reached for the picture. He was close to tears, but he was smiling too.</p> <p>There was more in the package, and Zane dumped the rest out. Several heavy metal emblems slid onto the counter. Ty picked one up, turning it over. They were classic Mustang emblems, the patina and weight marking them as originals and not recasts.</p><p>Ty began to laugh, shaking his head. \u201cBastard,\u201d he said, almost fondly. \u201cSomewhere there\u2019s a Shelby owner who is very pissed off right now.\u201d</p><p>Zane reached under Ty\u2019s chin to lift his head and meet his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about Smith and Wesson.\u201d</p><p>Ty gave him a sad smile and nodded. \u201cI knew he\u2019d come get them eventually. I\u2019m sorry your mom\u2019s a raging bitch.\u201d</p><p>Zane shrugged. \u201cWe all have our little problems.\u201d</p> <p>Ty snorted and stepped closer, resting his chin on Zane\u2019s shoulder with a sniff.</p><p>Zane hugged him tight. \u201cI have something that might make you feel better.\u201d</p><p>Ty turned his face into Zane\u2019s neck and inhaled deeply. \u201cDoes it involve you in a Stetson?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat too.\u201d Zane moved away, heading for the bags they\u2019d dropped at the door. He rummaged through his laptop case and came out with a thick plastic protective sleeve. He couldn\u2019t help but grin when he handed it to Ty.</p><p>Ty took it warily. He\u2019d no doubt been expecting something fun like glow-in-the-dark spurs or a stolen lasso. He popped the sleeve open and pulled the contents out without asking any questions. As soon as he saw the picture, he began to laugh.</p><p>Zane grinned wider. Before they\u2019d left Texas, Tish had sent it to the house as a thank-you and Harrison had brought it to Zane along with the legal papers. It was a picture taken by one of the Roaring Springs interns when Ty had visited the second time. In the photo, he stood inside Barnum and Bailey\u2019s enclosure, and all that could be seen was the side of his face and his broad shoulders, his stance wide to hold the weight of the tiger. Barnum was standing on both feet, hugging him. The tiger\u2019s massive paws held onto Ty\u2019s back and his head rested on Ty\u2019s shoulder. His floppy ear lay against Ty\u2019s hair.</p> <p>Zane had laughed and laughed when he\u2019d seen the photo, and he hadn\u2019t been able to resist making a call to the sanctuary.</p><p>Ty looked at the picture for a long time, a melancholy smile on his face, before he lifted it to look at the papers underneath. He frowned before looking back up at Zane, mouth open.</p><p>\u201cYou adopted Barnum?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Bailey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cZane!\u201d Ty lunged at him and gave him a ferocious one-armed hug, forcing him to stumble back.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Ty whispered against his ear.</p><p>\u201cAnything you love that much . . . it\u2019s worth any price.\u201d</p><p>Ty stepped back, his eyes shining. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p> <p>Zane smiled, and then rolled his eyes as Ty practically vibrated in front of him. \u201cOkay, go hang up your kitty pictures and pet your car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you!\u201d Ty said in an excited rush as he bounced away.</p><p>Zane watched his lover go, the smile still playing at his lips. He shook his head and laughed. Life with Ty. He was in for one hell of a wild ride. </p> </body></html>"]
